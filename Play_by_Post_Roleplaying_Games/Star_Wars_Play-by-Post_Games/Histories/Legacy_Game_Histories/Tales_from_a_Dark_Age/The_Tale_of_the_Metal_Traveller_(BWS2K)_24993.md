# The Tale of the Metal Traveller (BWS2K)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-27 16:46:42)

*Raxus Prime. This junkyard world, seen by some as the final resting place of all droids and starships, and the place where you can find the pieces to build pretty much anything. A world abandoned by the Sith and the Empire alike, and ruled by vicious scavenger gangs, fringe settlers, and droids. A small tribe of Jawas also live among the junkpiles, and there´s rumors of strange creatures roaming the farthest wilds of the planet.
In the vast fields of Raxus Prime, you can find wreckage of pretty much any kind of vehicle used in the last centuries, and probably even older than that. It has been an important world as far back as the time of fallen Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma and more recently served as the stronghold of Darth Tyranus during the Clone Wars more than a century ago. In short, it can be said that few people knows what secrets lies buried here, and a lone scavenger droid definitely have no clue.
This is where our tale begins.*

![Servo_Introduction_Cruiser.png](http://i1108.photobucket.com/albums/h414/BWS2K/Servo_Introduction_Cruiser.png)
Despite the myriad abandoned machines and rusted out scrap littering the landscape, the hulking mass of a long-derelict space cruiser is unmistakable on the **Raxus Prime** skyline. Not an uncommon sight, it's looming shadow is no less imposing... or intriguing. Whatever treasures, or dangers, lay hidden inside, few travelers would dare uncover them alone. A lone droid known as **Servo** in search of parts for a Sorosuub Landspeeder has litte reservations, however. He has watched the site from a distance for several days and seen no indication of peril. Calculating the structural integrity of various points on the hull, he enters through a gaping hole in the South side of the ruined craft...
[*Light levels below optimal…portable light sources will necessary for exploration of lower levels…*]
The ship lay tail-end up, making what would generally be the aft bulkheads more like the deck now. Servo advances slowly down a corridor lit by the beaming Raxus sun pouring through damaged portions of the hull.
[*…signs of heavy looting on surface level…upper levels likely looted as well…structural integrity estimates in question…re-assessing…*]
Leaping from a loose durasteel panel just in time and nearly falling when it gives way, Servo is thankful for the stability offered by magnetic pads installed on his feet. It appears to have been part of the entry hatch for a turbolift. Moments go by before the loud **clang** of the panel hitting bottom. Calculating the distance of the shaft from how long the panel fell, there are far more levels to the ship below ground than anticipated. Drawing his electrobinoculars and switching the light amplification mode on, Servo can see faint light sources pouring into the shaft from nearly thirty meters down. It could be some reflective surfaces playing with light that's made it's way down through some other part of the ship, or it could be something more.
In a rare display of behavior, he remarks to himself, "We should have brought a glow rod." Stowing his electrobinoculars in his arm compartment and readying his sporting blaster rifle in both hands, Servo ventures down the shaft - once again thankful for his magnetic feet.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-28 15:30:37)

Descending closer into the core of the ship, the light dissipates more and more, and the clear light covering the surface of Raxus Prime is reduced to a dim illumination casting shadows everywhere and leaving small cavities and corners in darkness. The descent path narrows after a while, and it seems likely that Servo has now passed into what is no longer a hole torn in the hull by weapons fire, but more of an actual service tunnel that were there even before the wreckage ended up in this planetwide junkyard.
It becomes somewhat easier to climb when the tunnel becomes more of a non-wreckage style hole, and instead is divided into sections, each being separated by protrusions meant to seal off the tunnel with security hatches in the case of a fire or chemical leakage. For now, however, they functions very well as hand- and footholds.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-02-28 16:31:17)

[*Light levels reaching unacceptable levels…navigation now supercedes defensive posture…*]
Shouldering his rifle, Servo once again retrieves his electrobinoculars and scans the tunnel ahead, keeping an eye out for any promising hatches or hull designations.
---
Of particular interest would be areas where **parts for his landspeeder** might be found (a vehicle or maintenance bay, for instance) or where partial power to **lighting** could be restored (or, in that unlikely event, at least an emergency **lamp** mounted on the bulkhead).

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-28 17:06:26)

As he proceeds down the hatch, Servo spots a couple of side hatches likely leading out onto a floor, a corridor, or some adjoining service hatch. Few are labeled though, suggesting they are part of some internal network, and as he hits one of the door panels, it becomes apparent that whatever reactor powered this ship in the past has long since given up. There are however, some half worn down symbol on the walls of the hatch, probably identifying more about where the ship comes from. Unfortunately, Servo has no idea what kind of emblem it is.
A hatch he comes across though does have the looks about it that it might lead to something else than another maintenance tunnel, being a bit wider, and with a sign next to it. The sign is in a language unknown to him though, and without the controls working, opening it might not be as easy as you´d hope.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-02-28 17:54:11)

[*Language unknown…door inoperable…considering options…*]
Recalling bits of an ancient story overheard in *The Rusty Bucket*, Servo speaks in a firm voice:
"Friend."
When nothing happens, he hesitates for a moment, and tries it in binary:
"<01100110 01110010 01101001 01100101 01101110 01100100>"
[*Primary obscure entrance customs ineffective…considering secondary methods…*]
---
Reasoning that if it's sealed then perhaps the contents lay untouched, Servo now considers forcing it open with all his mechanical strength...
**Strength 2**

***15*** <- [15] 1d20

...or if that won't work, he will try some repairs to the hatch panel with his **tool kit**...
**Mechanics 13**

**Knowledge(Technology) 8**
Take 10 to know how to perform the jury-rig effectively on a possibly foreign interface, if necessary.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-28 18:49:56)

Finding a good hold, Servo applies his mechanical strength on the hatch, and after a few moments of applied pressure a loud clank sounds and as he pushes the panel forward it slowly swings open, though it doesn´t fall over as you might expect, but instead crashes to the left. As he crawls through it, he finds a larger room behind it, though he can make out very little with the tiny mass of light coming in from the tunnel, which has now been reduced to almost nothing.
As he takes a step forward he slams his foot against something, and realizes why the hatch didn´t fall forward. He had stumbled on the control for the hatch, and was currently walking on what was one of the walls of the room, which would make the very close wall on his left the actual floor of the room. A quick attempt at using the pael shows that it too is inoperative. It appears intact, but just like the one before, lacks power.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-02-28 21:10:29)

[*Light levels insufficient for further exploration…portable light source required…*]
Calculating that continued exploration without proper illumination would be inefficient, but knowing that departing the ship now that this chamber has been opened may be counter-productive, Servo retreats back up the tunnel to the surface. Once there he begins a search for materials to make at least one serviceable torch. On his way out he stores an image of the unknown symbol in his memory for later reference. It's possible **Rex**, or even **Cog** would recognize it, and it may help to determine the origin of the craft and whether it may hold additional treasures.
The irony that a droid on a planet full of machines, and parts of machines, would even attempt to construct a torch is not lost on Servo, and his heuristic processor will ensure this situation is *not* repeated.
---
Servo will be looking for any **flammable materials** like old ship's uniforms, tattered flags, or even machine belts or tires. Containers of **fuel** or similar substances will be helpful as well. If found, the material will be wrapped around whatever piping or metal rods are available for handles and he will fire rounds from his rifle in an attempt to ignite it. If he finds enough material for more than one, he will carry the rest (but no more than two extra) tucked into his bandolier (between his back and the strap). If all this is successful he will return to the large room. If materials cannot be found, he will have to come up with a better idea, which just may include making the trip to the spaceport due South of the ship to pick up some glow rods.
**Perception 10**
Take 20 to make a thorough search, using the electrobinoculars to search in darker corners if necessary.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-01 16:29:55)

Searching the surroundings, Servo manages to find a few pieces of cloth that could most likely be used as a makeshift torch. It´s rather difficult to say what the cloth pieces once were, but one of them looks like it could perhaps have been a Jawa cloak once. Given the dry, worn and dusty nature of the fabric though, that was likely a long time ago. The cloth is very dry, and as he didn´t manage to find any ignition liquids it will likely burn up rather fast, but he figures it will have to do.
Assembling his makeshift equipment, he returns down the tunnel and enters the forced hatch. Lighting his torch, he finds that the room is rather huge, easily a hundred meters across, and at least twenty in height. Which in practice makes it twenty meters wide, given the rotated nature of the crashed ship. Strangely though, it is quite empty, except for some random debris lying around. Taking a look up at the "ceiling", he notices that the structure looks unusually tough, and as he spots a series of force field generators lining it, he realizes that he must be in what was once a hangar bay, with its emergency blast doors closed.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-01 17:47:07)

[*Analyzing…chamber dimensions and equipment suggest a hangar bay…multiple exits probable…*]
Servo walks the length of the bay in search of any other hatches, closed or otherwise. Reasoning that since he just entered from a service tunnel, it would be logical that there would be at least one more (primary) exit from the hangar. Before getting to far he glances back towards the service tunnel to see what symbol, if any, is located there.
---
Again, taking **20** on **Perception** to notice any other doors to the hangar bay, Servo will explore the room. Torch in one hand, his other hand free to keep himself stable, he will also employ his magnetic feet so that he is walking on the bay's true floor. Aside from hatches, he's also keeping an eye out for more symbols and indication of a deck lift (used to bring ships up to the hangar from lower levels). Servo will explore this room until he finds something of interest or until his torch seems to be about halfway burnt. At that point he'll return to the service tunnel and continue his advance deeper into the ship.
He glances back to see if there's a symbol next to the entrance he just emerged from because while the symbol inside the tunnel might designate *Hangar Bay*, there might be a different symbol meaning *Service Tunnels* printed on this side.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-01 18:01:37)

As he walks across the length of the hangar, Servo once again notices how extremely empty it seems. As he comes across what would seem to be the usual entrance to the hangar, his hopes of getting further diminishes greatly. Just like the external exit seems to have been shut close, the entrance too have had its emergency blast doors shut closed, and even though they´re not magnetically sealed, he most likely won´t be able to wrestle these doors open.
Returning out into the service tunnel, he discards his torch, as the dry cloth has all but burned out. As the dimly burning stick of light falls further into the tunnel, it doesn´t take long for it to slam into the ground, indicating the end of the tunnel. At the bottom, he can spot a hatch similar to the one he just entered, though on the opposite side of the tunnel.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-01 20:08:03)

[*Calculating…continued exploration inefficient at this time…superficial analysis of far hatch warranted…*]
Servo continues down the tunnel to the bottom and searches the hatch. It appears to be in the same condition as the first one, and he might be able to force it open but does not wish to do so at this time. Looking for any symbols on or around this hatch before leaving, He climbs back up the passage to the surface level and makes careful note of it's location. He then sets off in the direction of the nearest spaceport, knowing at his best speed it will still take at least two days. Plenty of time to consider the necessary equipment for uncovering whatever secrets may lie hidden in the derelict craft - and whether it's even worthwhile to do so.
---
Once again Servo will take **20** on **Perception** to observe the hatch - presumably it's the same as the first and could be forced open. Whether it is or not is irrelevant, as he wants to make a few purchases before continuing his search of the ruins. His rifle is shouldered, and he's making no major attempt at being quiet - valuing speed over stealth. Still, Raxus Prime can be a dangerous place for a lone droid, and he stays alert for the unexpected.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-02 00:16:28)

Hampered by his lack of proper equipment, Servo decides to return to *The Rusty Bucket* to resupply, and perhaps ask around among the more knowledgeable and see if he can learn anything about the emblems that marked the crashed ship. It takes him just above two days to get back, thanks to a rather wide detour in order to avoid a pair of scrap crawlers piloted by a roaming tribe of nomadic Jawa. Those little scavengers most likely have no restrictions that would keep them from disabling a lone droid and then try to sell him off to a spacer or merchant at the local spaceport.
When he finally reaches the settlement, the droid can feel the weariness flow over him like a flood of water. Well, not literally of course, but the droid equivalence of being ready to collapse from exhaustion. Making the long journey without recharging had really taken a toll on his batteries, and unless he wanted to forcefully shut down in the middle of nowhere, it would be wise to at least take the time to recharge his batteries before heading out again.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-02 01:13:16)

As Servo enters *The Rusty Bucket* he spots **Cog**, his astromech friend.
"Greetings friend Cog. We are in need of recharging. Are there any available ports in the garage?"
Cog chirps in the affirmative that port three is free and that Servo is welcome to it. He adds that when Servo has finished, he wants to hear all about his latest adventures.
"Naturally, we would be glad to share our travels. Perhaps while I am charging, you would investigate this symbol for me. I found it near a hangar bay hatch, in a service tunnel on the cruiser…"
Servo then proceeds, in the quick and efficient **Binary** language to describe the image. Anxious to be of any help to his courageous friend, and to take part in one of his adventures, Cog reassures Servo that he'll do his best - and that he'd better get back to his duties.
Making his way to port three in the garage, Servo settles down for a full charge, after stowing his gear in a rented foot locker. Owners change almost as often as the patrons at *The Rusty Bucket*, and he's learned that neither can be trusted to not swipe a droid's belongings while he's switched off. In those brief moments before being completely powered down, Servo reflects on another derelict craft he once explored...<div style="text-align: center;">
===
</div>

Many years ago, when they still traveled together, Rex and Servo were exploring the wreckage of an Imperial Star Destroyer. Lore at a local cantina held that it had been pulled down from orbit by a Jedi very strong in the Force, but of course no one could actually verify that claim. For days the two droids searched for any decent salvage, but the site had been picked thoroughly clean by roaming Jawa traders. It was during the final sweep that several decks collapsed and left Servo trapped below the surface. Any comlink transmissions were garbled beyond a few dozen meters due to unusual solar interference throughout the day - now they didn't work at all. As Rex worked furiously at clearing the debris from above, Servo did his part to make a tunnel in an upward direction. Suddenly he was seized from behind and thrown hard against a bulkhead. There was near zero visibility in the chamber, but a strange glowing orb arced energy into the deck and took a savage shape before his very optics.
With a mighty roar the creature finally assembled its massive form and glared at Servo with a single electric eye. It seemed to speak directly into his being - a message of ancient malevolence, not very interested in company. Missing a giant mechanical claw by millimeters, Servo launched himself up and over the metal beast and landed on the opposite side of the room. He quickly scaled the wall and, finding a service duct, narrowly avoided another attack by squeezing inside. He crawled for several minutes with the beast tearing through the duct behind him, only to find it end at a much larger chamber with no exit. With only moments to spare Servo drew his newly acquired blaster rifle and fired several bolts down the duct. The creature merely bellowed louder and breached the room with the ferocity of a hundred caged nexu. It's claws now unavoidable, Servo found himself in the clutches of the beast, staring into the steadily growing electric blue eye. Suddenly **<ERROR…MEMORY CLUSTER DAMAGED…DATA IRRETRIEVABLE>**
Servo couldn't recall exactly how it ended, but he did somehow remember Rex standing over his damaged chassis calling his name. Perhaps some residual electrical charge had reacted with the solar activity that day, causing unusual phenomena. Perhaps Rex remembered. He did have better memory storage.
Servo's processor quieted as he drifted off into the inactive state of droid slumber...
---
Paying whatever costs are necessary for both a charge and the locker, Servo will charge to optimal levels before checking in with Cog about the symbol and, if need be, search for a bit on the Holonet or ask around.
**Gather Information 3**

***10*** <- [10] 1d20

...if necessary, and if taking **10** isn't appropriate. Once he sorts that all out, he'll begin to shop for supplies.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-02 15:40:25)

Feeling fully-charged and ready for another couple days, Servo gathers his gear and proceeds to search out Cog. Going over his available credits and prioritizing the most likely requirements for his second, and hopefully last, foray into the wrecked ship, he also prepares a list of supplies to be purchased. As he enters the cantina proper, Servo spots Cog behind the counter working to repair a broken beverage dispenser. Rather than interrupt or wait he decides to take a short walk over to *Geared Up*, the nearest (and only) supply shop around. He's done some menial work for **Meldo Selkin**, the owner, before, and often trades useful things he finds in his travels here for credits. Meldo is quite jovial, for a Human, and has run the shop for several decades. His children have all grown up and moved off-planet, his wife passed away many years ago. A good friend doesn't pry, and Meldo never offered an explanation - and Servo is a good friend.
"Servo!" Meldo exclaims from behind the counter, eyebrows raising in expectancy, "Bring me anything nice?"
"Greetings friend Meldo Selkin. I only require supplies today, but it is probable I will acquire something of worth soon. Necessary items include 3 power packs, 1 roll of mesh tape, 1 liquid cable dispenser, 3 glow rods, 1 knife and 1 suitable container to carry it all in - preferably with a shoulder strap. Standard total for supplies comes to 145 credits. Friend Meldo is an excellent judge of both worth and utility, and a reasonable price for a container or pack will be acceptable."
Meldo smiles at the list, knowing it's probably the biggest order he'll have this week. Business isn't guaranteed for a small shop like his on a planet like Raxus Prime, and the patrons he does manage seem to appreciate not being remembered and usually deal strictly in cash. He's known Servo for a long time though, and appreciates the droid's honesty and hard work.
"Well let me just punch all that in. I'm sure I've got some sort of pack around here that will work just fine for you. How's that landspeeder coming along?"
---
Servo and Meldo will make casual conversation, with any mention of the latest newsworthy events (who's at war, who's winning and how it might affect business - that sort of thing). The symbol will also be described to Meldo, drawn on some scrap paper if necessary, to see if he has ever come across it or anything like it. Servo will pay whatever total is reached for all the gear and then return to *The Rusty Bucket* to see what he can find out about that symbol from Cog, and from checking the Holonet - if Meldo isn't able to help.
**[**I'm not sure what rolls would be required here, or if any are appropriate at all, but Servo should be able to obtain a loose idea of what's going on in the galaxy (the Imperials, the Sith - all that stuff) from Meldo and whatever headlines make the Holonet. He'll spend no more than thirty minutes looking for information about that symbol's meaning on the computer at the 'Bucket, figuring it just may need to be something he learns on his own if it isn't readily deciphered. The power packs, tape, dispenser and knife will all go in his bandolier and the glow rods will all be carried in the shoulder bag - which has enough room to carry back any interesting trinkets found. I'll wait to update the character sheet until I know credit totals for the gear and charging/locker rental. -BW**]**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-03 19:43:05)

Feeling fresh and restored, Servo returns out to the cantina, only to find Cog being occupied at the moment. Choosing not to disturb his friend at the moment, the droid decides to head over to the local supply shop instead, to acquire the supplies he will need. As he presents his list to Meldo Selkin, the owner of the shop, the human shakes his head.
**"I´m sorry friend, but as I´ve told you before, we here on Raxus Prime don´t exactly go by standard prices. We´re at the bottom of the food chain, and the increased disturbances have only made pilot even more reluctant to make the supply run here. I can go as low as 300 credits for the whole batch, but that´s all I can do"**
As he begins to pack stuff down into a explorer bag - the type that is carried in a strap over the shoulder, hanging by the waist - he keeps talking.
**"Just don´t blame me, blame those in charge. With the Alliance Remnant Fleet increasing its activity, the Empire have drawn most of its forces into the war, and the spacelanes are becoming even less safe than before"**
Handing the bag over to Servo, he takes his payment and waves the droid goodbye as Servo makes his way towards the cantina. As he meets up with Cog, he learns that the symbol he encountered in the wrecked cruiser is the logo of the Colicoid Creation Nest, a droid manufacturing company that was highly active about a hundred and fifty years ago, though nowadays they are not such a big player on the market anymore.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-03 21:39:41)

Servo, feeling much better prepared for this excursion, chirps a friendly "Goodbye, friend Cog." in Binary and leaves for the derelict ship. Taking care not to be seen by any roaming Jawa tribes, an odd thought crosses his mechanical mind as he travels - one he's never had before. He wonders what it would be like to leave Raxus Prime.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-04 15:52:28)

After a long journey, Servo finds himself back at the crashed cruiser. It has drawn near nightfall, so the glow rods he brought along should really be paying off, as the minor amount of light that managed to filter its way down the last time he was there is going to be reduced even further. As he approaches the tunnel leading down into the ship, it looks just like it did when he left.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-04 16:13:55)

Before heading into the wreckage, Servo takes a moment to affix one of the glow rods to his rifle with a piece of mesh tape - in case things do get dangerous. He then re-shoulders his rifle and activates one of the other glow rods, finding his way to the closed door at the end of the service tunnel and passing by the marked hangar bay where he originally explored. As the darkness closes in around him, he is quite thankful for the resupply trip. Careful to notice any symbols on the new hatch, Servo sets the glow rod down and tries to pull it open as before.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-04 22:21:36)

Just like on the hangar entry hatch, Servo finds it to be surrounded by a few inscriptions and text segments in a language he cannot decipher. As he applies his servo-enhanced strength against the hatch, he finds it giving way, but slower than the other hatch. He waves it off as an effect of the gravity though, it´s hard to keep your bearings in these tunnels.
Going through the hatch, his glow rod casts its light down the length of a corridor. Larger, and with less gizmos on the walls, this seems to be an actual corridor, and not just another maintenance hatch. There are no doors on the side of the hallway, though in the far end he can see a T-cross intersection.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-04 22:48:45)

Wondering what the inscriptions could mean, Servo makes a note of them. Perhaps he can find someone to decipher them in the future if necessary. For now he simply advances to the end of the hall and shines his glow rod down either side of the intersection and calculates which way would be best. Magnetic feet allow him to walk on the true floor, which helps slightly with orientation - but not with the gravity pulling on his gear. Hopefully that will be the least of his worries.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-06 11:54:33)

Shining the light down both corridors, Servo finds one of the ending in a door, while the other one seems to go on for much longer, and he can see it splitting off into a few places before finally ending in what looks to be another T-intersection. His glow rod is powerless to illuminate the entire length of the longer corridor, and leaves is covered in a soft, ghostly gloom.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-06 20:52:17)

It's been a while since Servo has seen ruins this extensive, but it's not uncommon for decommissioned ships to be brought to rest on Raxus Prime. What *is* slightly unusual about this particular ship is the lack of disturbance by Jawa tribes or other looters. That's two hatches he's had to pry open - usually there's intrusion at least one hatch deep. Looking at the door before him, he turns down the corridor and once again applies his mechanical strength to make way.

**[Edit:** Perhaps a more accurate title would be Repair Bay or something, he's not looking to haul back a ship's reactor as much as smaller spare droid/vehicle parts/tools. Sorry if "Engineering" was mis-leading.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-07 15:43:12)

As Servo pushes on the door, he finds it far more robust than the previous two hatches he has forced, and it won´t even budge under his pressure, no matter how hard he applies himself.
As he scans his databases for matches of this particular ship structure, he comes up with a myriad of possible results. A very large amount of ship utilizes maintenance tunnels like these, and it is impossible to identify the ship just by their structure.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-07 17:17:10)

[*Retrieving power pack demolitions procedure…calculating best possible placement…*]
Servo takes a moment to examine the hatch, which is clearly not going to be forced opened. Remembering some primitive demolitions procedures, he picked up some extra power packs back at Meldo's for just such an occasion. He pulls two of them from his bandolier and wraps them together with some mesh tape. He then tapes them to the hatch where they have the best chance of blowing it open without collapsing the tunnel, or causing too much damage to anything in the room beyond. Removing the safeties, he then leaps towards the corner of the tunnel he came from to avoid the blast.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-07 21:09:22)

Taping together a pair of power packs, Servo manages to create a very crude bomb. Attaching it to the door in front of him, he begins to remove the safety dowels on the power packs, causing them to start amassing an overload charge, which will eventually cause their detonation. Once the last dowel is removed, he makes haste and retreats back to the intersection from where he came. In a matter of moments, the IED goes off with a deafening explosion, and the blastwave can be felt all the way back to Servo as the hallway is filled with fire and smoke.
Once the smoke clears, however, the result is far from satisfying. Apart from being somewhat scorched and blackened, the door hasn´t moved one bit.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-07 22:10:13)

Surveying the scene before him, Servo is intrigued at the results, or rather, the lack of results. His calculations predicted at least partial destruction of the hatch, but it hasn't moved at all.
"Interesting," he remarks out loud, to no one in particular. His words seem deafening in the still, stale air. His sensors detect the faint traces of smoke and burnt metal. Had he an actual nose he might have crinkled it in disapproval.
Checking the nearby bulkheads to see if any symbols or signs survived the explosion that might indicate what would be behind the hatch, Servo turns and continues down the longer leg of the corridor with his glow rod in hand.
"At least we didn't blow ourselves up."

Servo will continue down the corridor, in the direction of the "soft, ghostly gloom" cast by his glow rod against the deep darkness.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-09 03:50:20)

Finding no hint as to what´s behind the massive door except for some writing in a language he doesn´t understand, just like inside the maintenance hatch, Servo sets off own the other corridor. As he walks, he hears a low, clanging noise that seems to come from the left branch of the intersection at the end of the corridor. As he walks a few meters into the he passes a closed door on his left, one labeled with a number of signs, and even if he cannot really read them, he does recognize the ones that symbolizes radiation and biohazard dangers.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-09 10:31:07)

[*Biohazard/Radiation warning present…meaning is inconclusive without further study…investigating distant sounds is more efficient use of time…*]
Making a note of the designated hatch's location, Servo continues down the corridor to discover what could be causing the low, clanging noise he detects. It could be caused my machinery, or it could be another explorer.
[*Threat calculations warrant increased caution…*]
Given that whatever lies ahead may not be so interested in company, Servo draws his rifle and switches on the glow rod attached to it and stows the one in his hand. He proceeds with caution - if it happens to be a resident, they've certainly heard his failed demolition attempt. He proceeds with caution...

**Stealth 10**

***6*** <- [6] 1d20

Servo is attempting to move quietly...
**Perception 10**

***2*** <- [2] 1d20

...and to tell if the noise changes at all, which may indicate it's moving towards him or reacting to his presence (he does realize, after all, that no matter how quiet he is he still has a glow rod on, and he is trying not to get surprised).

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-12 23:24:42)

As Servo moved forward, the clanging noise increased in volume, and when he is about 9 meters in front of the intersection, something becomes visible. Stepping out from one of the side corridors is a massive droid. It has kind of a circular appearance, like a big "C", and on its side extends a series of legs, placed in a similar manner as on some insects.
Apparently spotting Servo, the droid paused in its steps, and a blue energy field shimmered into existence around it.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-12 23:57:21)

[*Threat assessment…moderate danger…caution required…*]
Servo sees the metallic figure emerge from around the corner, only moments before he too is spotted. It might not be interested in a fight, but lone droids in dark tunnels that don't have shield generators need to be careful about who they shoot at - especially other, larger droids that do. Keeping his rifle trained in the direction of the other droid, Servo backs up hoping to seek cover around the corner in the event of a firefight.
He chirps out a quick "**Greetings Shielded One. I am Servo. I do not wish a confrontation.**" in Binary for good measure, not convinced it'll do any good. Niceness usually doesn't count for much from a droid.
---
**Initiative +10**

***6*** <- [6] 1d20

Servo is attempting to retreat back around the corner he just came from to gain some cover from any blaster fire that might come from the other droid. Even if Servo can't make it all the way, he'll still move away from him.
**Standard**: *Fight Defensively* (+5 bonus to Reflex Defense)
**Move**: *Move* back to get cover from the corner
**Swift**: None taken

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-13 03:50:05)

Whatever diplomatic intentions Servo have, they are cut short as the other droid raises two arms equipped with what looks as blaster cannons. That assumption proves to be correct, as both of them rings out in rapid succession. One of the blasts streaks past the lone droid, but the second one clips him right in the midsection, sending sparks and metal flying.
Still standing, but having taken a serious blast, Servo retreats back down the corridor, doing his best to use what little cover he can to avoid the assault of the other droid. The other droid is apparently built for battle though, and as its raging barrage of blaster bolts swarms around his escape, one of the scores a severe hit in his shoulder section, causing a heavy breach in his chassis.
((
Man, what a streak of rolls I had. You lost initiative, and got pretty hammered in the first round. Retreating didn´t quite make it back into cover, but you can reach it with one more Move action. I started the other droid off in the second round as well.
To tell you the truth, my dice screwed you badly. Two great attack rolls, and more than half of the damage dice came up with their maximum results. Servo has lost 59 Hp, and moved to -2 on the condition track.
))

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-14 10:41:28)

Sparking and hissing from losing nearly 90% operational capacity, Servo continues to retreat around the corner and further away from the superior combatant. His processor practically buzzing with calculations and situation analysis.
[*Self-Diagnostic running…systems in critical condition…chassis heavily damaged…tactical options limited…*]
A plan formulates in milliseconds, though Servo concludes its success rate is far less than optimal. The droid seems to have a couple weaknesses that could be exploited. It can't move very fast in its current locomotive state, and switching to another mode would both take time and require shield deactivation. Either case is acceptable, and Servo begins to setup his ambush. Rounding the corner to safety he spends a moment completing his self-diagnostic - the results rather grim. Certainly Cog will want to hear this story, if Servo can survive in one piece to tell it. He reaches into his pack to retrieve one of the two extra glow rods.
[*Enemy locomotive analysis conclusive with 99.9% accuracy…enemy optical capabilities: insufficient data to calculate…*]
Maybe he can see in the dark and maybe he can't. Raxus Prime offers all sorts of interesting options for an ambitious droid.

**Move Action**: Move back into the other corridor where he came from as much as possible
**Swift**: Get a Second Wind
**Move**: 1/2 of retrieving a glow rod from his pack (with one hand, still keeping his rifle up in the other)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-14 13:23:39)

Wasting no time in retreating back the hallway he had come down before, Servo can hear the barrage of bolts behind him silence. With his internal failsafes managing to shut down most redundant systems and cut off the worst leakage of hydraulic fluids, he feels some of his operational capacity return. Reaching into his backpack, he rummages around for a glow rod. Behind him, he can hear the distinct sound of something heavy rolling over the floor, with the sound rising.
((
You got 7 squares into the hallway, and you recovered 16 Hp
))

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-14 13:31:10)

[*Systems at 35%…internal damage stabilized…repairs necessary…*]
Servo can hear the droid rolling down the hallway towards him, indicating his shields are temporarily down. He continues his plan with as much haste as his damaged metal joints allow.
---
**Move Action:** 2/2 of retrieving glow rod
**Swift:** Activate it
**Swift:** Deactivate the glow rod mounted on his rifle

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-14 13:54:25)

As Servo stands around, suddenly the rolling sound stops, and as he turns around, he sees the massive battle droid uncurling itself, with its shimmering energy shield coming back online, and its two blaster-equipped arms raising into a firing position.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-14 14:11:08)

[*Locomotive capabilities underestimated…probability of survival less than 5%…*]
Dropping the activated glow rod to the floor, Servo moves backwards into the darkness hoping to get a round in before the shields fully encompass his target. As he pulls the trigger, a phrase comes to memory, though he's not sure why:
"***Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough!***"
---
**Swift Action:** drop the active glow rod on the ground, illuminating the intersection
**Move:** move away from the droid as far as possible, seeking cover behind whatever doorways or corners are available

[**Edit:** Forgot to adjust my Attack roll per Condition.]

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-16 14:25:13)

Taken off guard by the speed of the battle droid, even in its rolling mode, Servo drops the glow rod he was working with and fires a shot at the Droideka almost in desperation (if droids were capable of that emotion). The weak bolt from the sporting rifle is absorbed harmlessly by the powerful energy shield of his opponent. Taking a few short steps forward, the Droideka opens fire with its blaster cannons once again. The first round of bolts misses Servo just barely, but the second and third ones bites into his already wounded chassis, and then a fourth clips him straight in the chest, completely breaching his reactor core...
((
Well, that was the rather tragic end of the first part of Servo´s tale. I hope we have now learned the first rule of the Galaxy: If it is bigger, better defended, and have better weapons than you, *run*. Anyway, you lost one Force Point in order to stay alive, and you also lose whatever equipment you were carrying. Other than that though, you are okay. You are considered disabled at the moment, and will remain so until I put up a new post to continue the story. It should be up somewhere tonight.
))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-22 10:52:54)

Sometimes you are lucky. A blaster bolt to the reactor core would most likely cause a massive explosion, and likely render any droid shattered into hundreds of useful spare parts. But the bolt that should have ended Servo´s existence missed the critical core by a millimeter or two. However, due to the massive damage sustained to his chassis, and the stress overload of his processor, the droid winds up completely disabled. He don´t know for how long, but he is occasionally reactivated for a few seconds, and his systems would indicate that more than two weeks have passed since he fateful encounter with the Droideka. He has very little clue as to what has happened during this time, but he has fleeting images of hooded creatures working on him, and being stashed in a warehouse of some sort loaded in his short term memory. When he is activated this time however, things are a bit different...
As his photoreceptors flickers to life, Servo finds himself lying on what probably served as an operations table at some point in time. However, as he looks around, grease stains, oil slicks, and tools more suited for a workshop than a medical facility indicates that it might be used for other things at the moment. He is in a small room, perhaps 3-4 square meters and on his second look around, he becomes pretty certain that it is a workshop of some sort. As his internal diagnostics tools completes a quick scan, he detects two anomalies not normally part of his system. He detects the presence of a restraining bolt attached to his chestplates, as well as another system that seems to be linked into his central power core. He cannot identify the nature of the system however.
After a few moment, a small, dome-headed astromech droids rolls into the room. He cannot tell exactly which model, though it is definitely am R-series astromech, as manufactured by Industrial Automaton. The droid rolls into the room, spins around its domed head for a second and then centers on Servo, and he receives a quick burst of Binary, accompanied by a series of beeps and boops.
**Binary**

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-22 11:11:21)

"**Yes, it would appear we are.**" Servo chirps back, still getting his bearings. Concluding that he has now been fitted with a restraining bolt and is missing all his previous possessions, he calculates the odds of surviving his encounter in the tunnels. He is, by all counts, lucky - though it's not a word he would have used to describe himself before.
Sitting up he asks, in Basic, "**We wish to inquire as to our whereabouts, and if possible, an explanation of the modifications we've detected in our systems?**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-22 11:48:44)

The little astromech chirps a quick string of sounds back at Servo.
**Binary**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The captain will be here to brief you soon. He said something about finding a use for a droid equipped to walk on starship hull exteriors. The restraining bolt is most likely the work of the Jawas you were purchased from

</details>

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-22 12:05:07)

"**Thank you.**"
As far as Servo remembered, he had always been on Raxus Prime. The thought of working on starships was intriguing, and the idea of leaving his home filled him with both excitement and fear - or as near an approximation to those emotions as a heuristic processor can get. Of course Servo had walked on plenty of hulls before, but not usually in the service of anyone, and never on the hull of a ship that actually worked.
As he waits for the captain to arrive, Servo replays the clips stored in his memory of the Jawas working over him and tries to correlate any relevant conclusions about what this new system attached to his core could be - but it's mostly just garbled images, and not very helpful.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-23 17:52:33)

The astromech tweeps an affirmative response and rolls out of the the room, and Servo is left alone for a few minutes. This gives him time to complete a full self-diagnostic, which shows him that whoever found and repaired him - it seems highly likely he was found by one of the Jawa tribes roaming Raxus Prime - have managed to fix the damage the droideka inflicted on him. He does, however, look even more like a patchwork than before, as the replacement chassis plates differs completely in looks from his original plates.
Suddenly, the door to the small engineering section (yes, let´s call it that) opens, and a large droid enters the room. Servo cannot really identify the model, though that isn´t very surprising, as the droid appears to be heavily modified from it´s original shape. While many details were odd, the main thing was that where had once probably been a hand appendage, was now what seemed only to be a massive cannon. Also, the upper portion of the droid was clad in what actually looked like durasteel braces from a starship. As it spoke, it sounded like either the vocabulator was old, or something in it was loose, and the voice was hard and rough.
**"So this is my new mate, eh? Haven´t seen anything punier in all the galaxies I´ve travelled. But we´ll fix that, oh yes! Listen up you piece of junk, you are from now on a part of Skullwire´s crew, understand? In case yer systems haven´t picked them up yet, ye´ve been hotwired with some pretty nasty stuff, which I control. So don´t ye think about deserting, or ye´ll be returned to whatever scrapheap ye came from in no time. Now, report to the armory, I´ve got some work for ye before we hit our mark"**
Without further words, the big droid leaves the room, and Servo is one again left alone.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-23 20:17:02)

Servo slowly tests his joints, then his leg servos. He steps down off the table and concludes his motivators are in satisfactory condition.
[*Systems operating at optimal efficiency…motivators fully functional…*]
He hopes his friends back on Raxus Prime, Rex and Cog, aren't overly concerned with his abrupt absence. There's insufficient data to calculate the odds of ever seeing them again, but one never knows these things. Even Meldo might get worried after a while.
Servo sets off through the hatch in search of the armory - noting that he is once again wandering the unknown corridors of a ship. At least this time he doesn't need a glow rod.
---
Presumably it's not that difficult to find, but Servo will ask around if necessary.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-24 17:11:21)

As he exits the room, Servo finds himself walking around on a ship that might be in working shape, but that is definitely in need of a good cleaning or two. Littering the hallway, he finds everything from spare droid parts to what seems to be a broken military weapons crate. What stands out the most though, is that wherever he goes, he only meets droids, no organic beings.
After asking a few people for directions - and getting a couple of rather rude comments back - he manages to find his way to the armory. As he enters, he finds an aging AD-series weapons maintenance droid rummaging through a less than organized shelf. Upon hearing Servo enter, it turns around, and its photoreceptors focuses on him.
**"Observation: Ah, the new recruit. The captain sent you here to make sure you didn´t get clobbered when we hit the D-Tec convoy, did he? Well, you should have gotten here sooner then. I don´t have time to reinforce that chassis of yours"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-24 17:44:00)

[*Chassis integrity within standard parameters for routine duties…Motivators now 100% adjusted to new systems weight…*]
"**Greetings. We are unsure of what a *Deetek* is, and are puzzled at why chassis reinforcements would be necessary. Until present, the only justification for our presence concerns our ability to walk on starship hulls - and our chassis is in optimal condition for that. Additionally, our limited experience with starship captains leads us to conclude that if he has sent us to the armory for chassis reinforcement then you should find the time to reinforce our chassis. When you are done with that, you might consider making it easier to find the armory - perhaps using better passage-way designations or colored deck lines - since finding it has consumed the majority of our time since the captain ordered us to report here.**"
Servo felt these were all very obvious and logical conclusions, and he'd only been aboard for a short time. Maybe being rude was how these droids covered for some flaw regarding logical deductions - what might be called 'common sense' - he wasn't sure.
"**If you cannot find the time to follow the captain's orders, perhaps there is some other preventative measure against '*clobbering*' you could attempt. I do not know if he is the sort that will forgive easily.**"
Adding, "**And we call ourselves Servo.**" before waiting patiently for the droid's response.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-27 16:34:52)

The maintenance droid keeps its photoreceptors fixed on Servo for a moment, and then it turns around to start rummage through a shelf behind it, all the while talking.
**"Explanatory Observation: Your information is correct, but critical data fragments are missing. I have received no instructions regarding you whatsoever, thus I can only derive the captains reasons for sending you here from the data at hand. While there may have been external circumstances at work, I can only act on the present situation. And in that situation, your arriving here earlier would have been preferable, at least on your part"**
Apparently finding what it had been looking for, the droid once again turns around, and throws a small, bracer-shaped object at Servo, who captures it. Keying something into a computer terminal next to it, the droid continues.
**"Clarification: D-Tec is a small scale droid manufacturing company, known primarily for their tracking software models. While not state of the art, the captain has deemed their likely security efforts to be an adequate risk considering the involved reward to our crew. As for your role in this effort, all too often have our operations faced increased demands in speed and brutality as a result of local authorities arriving on the scene too fast. So the captain decided to have some of the crew deploy to the outside of our prey and disable their communications equipment from there. And it seems like he found just the model for the job when we last stopped on Raxus"**
Pointing to the object now in Servos hand, he indicates some of the controls on it.
**"Explanation: While a full chassis reinforcement would have been preferable to ensure your protection on the hull exterior, this will have to suffice. It is a personal shield generator, one of the most powerful on he market, and it will provide a basic amount of protection from screening starfighter escorts or security drones.
Now, do you have anymore questions, or shall we proceed to primary armament procedures?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-27 17:54:05)

"**Our past success in combat is…less than desirable. This shield generator will certainly be of use. We thank you. We are also skilled with machinery and, to some extent, small-scale demolitions. We do not foresee any difficulties with this task. Please proceed.**"
Servo affixes the generator to its proper place and waits for the weapons maintenance droid to continue.
[*Device installation successful…combat survival rate increased 310%…*]

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-27 22:54:19)

**"Questionable Statement: You can thank me if you get back. These shields are designed for personal combat, and will not stand for a direct hit from a fighter craft. But it´s all I can do in the limited time frame"**
After a few more moments of rummaging in the shelves and containers behind him, the maintenance droid produces a heap of items on the counter in front of Servo.
**"Wellwishing Closure: There you go. Three detonite blocks should do the trick, and a simple pistol to keep you safe. Also, a few extra energy cells for the shield, just in case. Schematics indicates that you possess adequate storage capacity to accommodate this load. If there is anything else you requires state a request now, otherwise a hasty departure to the main hangar is advised. For directions there, just follow anyone else that is moving"**
Leaving Servo to his own business, the droid vanishes into the jungle of the armory behind him.
((
OK, you can add a SR 30 personal shield generator (Do you need a rundown of how they ork or do you have the KOTOR campaign guide?), 3 Detonite blocks, 1 Blaster Pistol, and 3 Energy Cells to your sheet.
))

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-27 23:44:20)

Placing the explosives in his right forearm storage compartment and the sidearm in his left and checking to make sure the energy shield won't hinder retrieval, Servo turns towards the hatch. The sounds of mechanical motivators all headed in one direction are unmistakable, and he easily reaches the main hangar. He surveys the scene before him - an assortment of nearly every make and model, and combination thereof, imaginable. He wonders if any other droids present are from Raxus Prime.
---
((
**Energy Shield, Heavy**: 1kg, SR 30 [p.71, KOTOR]?
))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-01 13:38:12)

Just as Servo observes, the crew assembled is a varied matching of all kinds of droid models, some originally built for combat, but others that appears to have been severly modified from their original purpose. All in all, he can spot about three dozen of them, and everyone appears to be armed in some way. At the front of the group he spots Skullwire himself, the droid captain yelling something at a droid in the front, but halts when Servo enters.
**"Ah, so we´re finally all assembled. Good good. Take a good look at the latest recruit into our crew mates, and one who´ll hopefully make our job a little more pleasant this time around. And if he´s lucky, maybe he´ll even be around to reap the rewards"**
This last comment made what could only be described as a cacophony of synthesized laughter echo throughout the hangar as the other droid turned to look at Servo. Their attention was returned to the front though when a loud noise followed Skullwire firing a shot from his massive cannon arm.
**"All right then, listen up. We´ll be upon them in a few minutes. Once the gunners have brought down their shields, we´ll go in close and board them. I want shock troopers in the front, and gunners in the rear. Sappers move to engage at opportunity, and I want the new member out on the hull the moment the docking clamps lock on, or I´ll sure to eject you into space myself. Everything clear?!"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-01 13:49:25)

Servo isn't sure if he needs to answer, but he manages "**Affirmative, Captain Skullwire.**" and wonders what *"…maybe he´ll even be around to reap the rewards"* means.
[*All systems operating at 100%…*]
He quickly runs another self-diagnostic, and wait for further orders to take his place on the target craft's hull.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-05 10:29:27)

Taking their stations in a well-rehearsed fashion, the droid crew gets ready for the boarding action. In a few minutes, the powerful thumping sounds of heavy blaster cannons firing echoes into the hangar, and quite soon a large freighter slides into view from the hangar. As the ship slides closer to the battered freighter, those closest to the energy field separating the hangar from the space outside can spot a few fighter craft circling the larger craft. While the fighters weapons increases the noise heard though the hull into the hangar, no serious damage seems to be sustained. When the distance between the ships decreases to a few hundred meters, a series of giant claw-like appendages extends from around the hangar opening on the outside of the ship.
Feeling a powerful shove from behind, Servo finds one of the other droids pointing in the direction of a small exit hatch near the main hangar entrance.
**"All right, scrap droid, that´s your exit. Once the claws dig into´em, get your rusty hide out there and take out their communications array"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-05 10:57:21)

The sights and sounds of ship-to-ship warfare are mesmerizing to Servo. He's seen plenty of wrecked craft in his time, but to see how they came to be little more than junk heaps back on Raxus Prime is quite stunning to watch. Feeling the sudden shove from behind and hearing his instructions, Servo spots the hatch and makes for it at his best speed. On the way he switches on his bracer and draws his pistol. This Skullwire, despite his obvious quirks, runs a tight ship and it's clear that the crew all have their roles - and he isn't interested to see what happens when someone fails. Reaching the exit, he readies to leap across to the other hull as near the array as possible.
[*Scanning for target…calculating distance and velocity required…powering jump servos…*]

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-06 17:01:49)

When the pirate ship draws close enough to its prey - an older Action VI model it seems - it sinks its giant claws into the hull of the other craft, and the massive claws digs their way through both armor and hull. Though it seems unlikely that they´ve dug all the way through it is apparently enough for Skullwire´s crew, as one of them disables the energy field in the hangar entrance, and the rest of them approaches quickly with various crude tools for breaking though the captured ship. Such an action might have been completely insane on any other ship, but with an all-droid crew, no one notices the rapid loss of oxygen in the hangar, and the proximity of the enemy ship prevents the sucking powers of cold space from drawing them all out into the void.
Seeing the energy field drop also serves as kind of a que for Servo, who makes a rather awkward jump onto the other ship, stumbling with the sudden loss of gravity, and nearly propels himself too far and into deep space. As he lands he latches on to the Action VI with his magnetic feet, and takes a look around. It takes him a few moments to locate the communications array of the ship, located at the far end of the vessel, some 30 meters from Servo´s current location.
((
Just as a reminder here, you take a -10 penalty to both Initiative and Jump checks due to the Energy Shield.
))

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-06 17:52:54)

With all manner of activity buzzing around him, Servo nearly misses his landing entirely - not a good start to the mission at hand. He neglected to compensate for the shield when calculating velocity and it makes a huge difference. Held fast by his magnetic feet, he spots the communications array and sets off as fast as he can manage across the hull.
---
((
Thanks, I forgot about that. It doesn't seem to matter much though, since my **Initiative** was a **1**. Servo will **Run** towards the array, which should cover up to 32 meters *uninterrupted*...
))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-08 10:16:15)

Getting his bearings on the outside of the hull, Servo picks up some speed and moves swiftly towards his objective. As he runs, he gets a better view of the space battle still going on around him. The two larger ships obviously unable to fight each other, the Action VI remains silent, while the pirate ship´s cannon batteries spreads brilliant energy lances across the space, met in the same way by the fighter escort of the freighter.
As he reaches the communications antenna, one of the fighters explodes into a massive fireball, spreading debris across space. The antenna array itself is quite large, measuring above 2 meters in height and taking up 4-5 square meters.
((
Actually, running can move you as far as 48 meters, but I figured it didn´t matter in this case.
))

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-08 10:43:29)

Having reached the massive array, Servo looks around to make sure he's safe from any immediate dangers and begins his work. The shield makes things difficult but turning it off could mean joining the debris floating off into infinite. He retrieves the detonite from his right forearm and begins calculating the best possible placement. While sound doesn't carry well in space at all, he can feel the ship shudder beneath him every time one of his crew blasts it with one of their cannons.
*Yes indeed,* thinks Servo, *Captain Skullwire knows what he's doing alright. Let's not disappoint him.*
[*Analyzing structure…optimal demolitions placement pending…*]

If possible, Servo will use a Force Point to help out with the **Mechanics** roll to really try and blow this thing to bits and prove his worth to Skullwire:

...and if this all involves climbing, although my magnetic feet shouldn't make this necessary:

))

---

Scanning the massive antenna array, Servo finds a weak spot in the structure, a slightly weaker piece of metal serving as the rotating axis for the antenna. As he molds the detonite blocks into a few small cavities lining the rod for about half a meter, suddenly the space around him is lit up by fire and explosions. Screaming past overhead, he spots one of the remaining fighters that have apparently spotted him. Even so, it was going to take some precision shotting from the pilot, not to blow up the array himself. But one thing was for certain at least, someone had seen him.
Finally getting the detonite in place, Servo sets the timer for a 30 second delay, giving him ample time to move away.
((
Ok, I just winged the time for you, hope that´s ok.
))

[*Calculating escape strategy…*]
Having successfully planted the detonite, Servo plans a hasty retreat. Without knowing what's going on inside the enemy ship it's not possible to calculate which hatches on the hull will open to a hallway of allies or a group of hostile beings of unknown make and armament. He could try to make it to the gaping breach in the side of the ship, but he's not armed for a full confrontation and isn't interested in being blown to pieces. Again.
[*Scanning for enemies…calculating fighter approach vector…*]
His pistol still in hand, he sets off at his best speed towards home - having settled on a final route and jump trajectory to bring him back into Skullwire's hangar bay. Hopefully the fighter pilot will hesitate to shoot at his own ship's hull, but a moving droid is a hard to hit droid and that's the best Servo can hope for.
---
**Jump** +4 (+14, -10 from shield) to leap off the hull and back into the hangar bay, if necessary.

***13*** <- [13] 1d20

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-12 10:25:03)

With the explosives securely in place, Servo moves quickly across the hull of the paralyzed Action VI freighter. Unaware of what is going on inside the ship, he reaches back to the boarding section and makes the leap back into his own ship. Most of the crew have left the hangar bay, and he can hear blasterfire and screams coming from the boarded ship, although not in any high frequency. Skullwire and his crew are obviously effective.
One of the remaining droids turns sharply as Servo comes flying into the hangar, but when he spots the scrap droid he lowers his weapon.
**"Oh, it is only you. I take it the communications array has been disabled then?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-12 10:41:39)

"**The detonite charges have been set and should be going off momentarily. We experienced no difficulties, and after a careful analysis of options concluded it would be best for us to return here for further orders.** "
Servo turns his photoreceptors towards the enemy craft and watches for the array to explode.
"**Your crew is quite skilled at this. We wonder - is this all you ever do?**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-12 11:36:13)

The quickly lowered blaster goes up as fast as it had gone down as the other droid takes a step closer to Servo. Clearly he had not been happy with what he had been told.
**"What do you mean "should be going off soon"!? Was your orders to set charges, or were they to destroy the communications array?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-12 12:24:26)

Servo faces the droid, then turns back to the array. His photoreceptors dim for a brief moment in what might be interpreted as a blink.
[*Reassessing mission completion…mission incomplete…*]
Servo hadn't counted on anyone interfering with his charges, but clearly he had been spotted by at least one fighter. It's possible he could've reported what he'd seen to someone not already engaged with Servo's shipmates. Calculating that a lot can happen in twenty-four seconds, Servo leaps back into position to watch and guard the communications array from a safe distance until it explodes in what he hopes will be an impressive display of fiery success.
---
**Jump +4** (+14, -10 from shield) to return to the other hull...

***12*** <- [12] 1d20

...and using **Run** to get to his previous position, with his pistol still drawn.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-13 17:39:34)

Now reminded of the full extent of his orders, Servo once again makes the leap back to the Action VI. Taking a sprint, he approaches the communications array, looking around with his pistol drawn. The silence of space is striking, and he can´t even hear the sound of the starfighters streaking around, and he guesses that they must have been shot down when he wasn´t looking.
After a few moments of eerie silence and waiting though, a blinding explosion that nearly overloads his photoreceptors erupts from the antenna array. As he refocuses, he can spot a large segment of the antenna itself floating along with much other debris over a small crater in the hull. It would probably be safe to say that he had completed his objective this time.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-13 20:58:11)

[*Target 100% disabled…mission complete.*]
Satisfied with the result of his handiwork, Servo refocuses his attention on the battle at hand. The missing fighters indicate all is going well for the rest of Skullwire's crew. He stores this sidearm and returns to the hangar bay at best speed. He approaches the guard from before, his personal shield shimmering with every step, confident his mission has now been completed.
"**We believe the communications array has been satisfactorily disabled, unless this ship possesses some ability to utilize antennae that are now floating in a small debris field to call for aid.**"
Turning to the hull breach where the rest of the crew had entered the other ship, he asks: "**We would be glad to help wherever else is necessary, but may require better weaponry.**"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-14 18:56:27)

The other droid looked at Servo for a few moment, and then a burst of mechanical laughter came over its external speakers.
**"You´d better stay here unless you want to be returned to the scrap pieces you were built from. The boys will soon be done anyway, and thanks to you getting rid of that dish, we can hopefully haul most of the cargo off before someone interfers. I like your attitude though, maybe you should go see Buckler and have him patch you up a little and you can join in the next raid"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-14 20:18:09)

The mechanical laughter takes Servo off-guard for a moment, but he quickly recovers and realizes the shipmate is pleased with his performance. While the two wait for things to settle down, he decides to make some inquiries.
"**Yes, thank you. We agree our combat abilities are of limited use. While we are waiting for the crew to finish, we would like to request some basic information. Any details about Captain Skullwire, his ship and crew would be appreciated. For instance: Is the Captain employed by anyone? What is the name of his ship? Is this procedure - what some might refer to as *pirating* - what takes up most of your time or do you engage in any other activities?**"
Servo makes a mental note to find Buckler and talk about some systems upgrades and waits intently for answers from the guard.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-20 15:52:54)

The other droids laughter dampens a bit, but he chuckles as he turns to look through the breach into the Action VI.
**"We are what you´d call *private contractors*, and we answer to no one but the captain. Our ship, the *Rusty Blade*, was originally a frigate in the service of the Galactic Alliance, but ever since it came into our possession it has undergone so many modifications that no one can probably recognize it anymore.
But make no mistake, we´re outlaws. Droids who roam without masters and engages in piracy…there´s only one sentence for such beings"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-20 22:39:00)

Servo isn't terribly surprised at this revelation, considering all he's seen so far. Still - aside from some rude behavior - the other droids appear to have accepted him as a shipmate. The Captain clearly has use for him anyway. Servo's success at disabling the communications array should go a long way to dispel any remaining doubts.
Picturing all manner of undesirable possibilities are included in *there´s only one sentence for such beings*, Servo responds, "**We understand. Thank you.**"
He wonders what his friend Cog would think of him as an outlaw - a *private contractor*. Certainly the adventure and excitement would capture his attention. Servo doesn't recall any ship named the *Rusty Blade*, though Captain Skullwire probably doesn't leave many witnesses to tell of his exploits. The occasional screams coming from the other ship attest to that.
Powering down his shield generator, Servo ponders his new occupation. He wonders if he'll ever have the opportunity to take part in a boarding party, and what he would do if he encountered anyone. Since it's clear that he has no further role in the current mission, he is content to simply wait in the hangar until things come to an end.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-23 09:14:57)

Just hanging around in the silence of the hangar for a few minutes longer, Servo soon starts to spot the crewmembers coming out of the captured ship, carrying crates and containers of various sizes, either in pairs or alone. Some of them are scorched and looks newly dented, but it doesn´t seems to affect the mood of the crew. As the first ones passes him by, one of them - a large droid, most likely some kind of modified cargo hauler - waves for Servo to get inside and help them haul the cargo outside. Given his brief look of the ships exterior, and his knowledge of various ship models, Servo can only guess that the boarded Action VI contains a lot of cargo.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-23 10:35:16)

It appears the fighting is over, and so Servo finds his way into the belly of the Action VI to help remove the plundered goods. It's unlikely they were able to transmit a distress code due to his performance at the communications array, but the ship was due somewhere at sometime. If it doesn't arrive patrols may come looking. In fact, with this much cargo, it's almost certain. As he makes his way through the scorched corridors, Servo is impressed - and somewhat concerned - at the handiwork of his crew. Having completed his assigned task brings a measure of peace to his metal mind, but not much. Facing the wrath of Skullwire is not something he ever wants to do.
Arriving in the cargo hold, he hefts one of the crates and begins his journey back to the *Rusty Blade*. Servo calculates it may take some time to off-load everything, but perhaps Skullwire is more selective about his loot. As he walks he begins to analyze the situation as whole - who was aboard this ship, what might their destination have been, what could be known about this cargo and such. While his conclusions lead to a negligible chance that anyone may have survived the assault, he exercises a degree of caution when passing through hallway intersections and across hatches just to be sure.
---
Servo will simply help in the unloading of the crates, but take **10** on any necessary **Perception** or **Stealth** rolls to avoid being ambushed (in this highly unlike event any are left alive aboard the Action VI). He'll also take make a **Knowledge (Technology)** roll to determine what might be in the crates. If the time passes uneventfully, he plans on visiting Buckler afterwards.
**Knowledge (Technology) +8**

***3*** <- [3] 1d20

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-25 17:46:24)

Working with the rest of the crew to move the captured goods, Servo moves in a beeline back and forth between the cargo storage of the Action VI and the hangar of the *Rusty Blade*. Working under Skullwire´s supervision, they unload the cargo in two separate sections, with a small portion of the captured cargo being stashed to the side. From what he can tell, most of the crates contains various spare parts and modules for usage in droids and other automated systems.
As they have unloaded what Servo estimates to be a very small portion of the transports goods, the captain calls for them to break up and return to ship. As the crew assembles back in the hangar, he watches how the giant claws detaches themselves from the Action VI, leaving the large ship to drift alone in space. Suddenly a rapid series of focused laser shots streaks into it, and as small explosions erupts along the hull of the ship, more and more erupts in a chain reaction, and as the pirate ship pulls away, their prey is turned into a brilliant fireball in the distance.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-04-27 00:50:59)

Servo takes in the scene, the brilliance of the blast causing his optics to dim slightly to avoid visual overload. His shipmates seem unimpressed - perhaps because this is a relatively common sight for them. He records the blast in his memory banks for review later. It stirs odd... calculations? Droids certainly aren't capable of real emotion, but this experience evokes something that eludes quantification. Servo makes a note to analyze the data and hopes he isn't malfunctioning. Skullwire doesn't seem the type to tolerate malfunctioning crew.
The last several hours would be of interest to Cog, Servo's astromech friend on Raxus Prime, and he's glad he thought to record the destruction of the Action VI for that reason as well. Turning his attention to things at hand, he's curious whether Skullwire will debrief the crew or if he is free to seek out Buckler and explore the ship further. Perhaps there's even a position aboard the *Rusty Blade* that Servo could fill - something that might use his knowledge of mechanics learned on Raxus.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-01 17:39:12)

As the crew watches the other ship reduce itself to space dust with chain reaction and internal explosions, a pair of giant panels slides in front of the hangar opening, to shield it from outer space. Shortly after they slides into place, a subtle shuddering can be felt, most likely as the ship makes the jump to hyperspace. Cheering is heard among the crew, and it doesn´t dampen but only increases in effect as Skullwire takes place on top of one of the captured cargo crates. It does quiet down, however, when the massive droid captain raises his cannon arm and fires a massive blast straight up into the hangar ceiling, leaving not only carbon scoring, but also a sooted crater.
**"All right, you worthless pieces of rust, that was some fine days work from all of you. Blasted freight crew never saw us coming. The organics never learn, do they? They should know by now, that Skullwire and his crew rules these spacelanes!"**
The roaring cheers explodes again with the last sentence, and instead of trying to hush them down again, the captan only cranks up the volume of his vocabulator, and turns himself until he finds Servo.
**"And it seems like we welcome a new brother into the crew today! Some bloody fine work on that antenna, might believe I did it myself. Not all who join our crew make it back from their first board, and it´s saying something about those who do"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-05 12:35:02)

Being a droid, Servo isn't capable of feeling emotions. He calculates that this would be a moment of pride, but some of Skullwire's words indicate a healthy measure of fear would be called for too. In the end a good droid pirate - and that's what he has become, it seems - should exercise caution at all times, but measurably less so in the presence of his shipmates. At least that's the most rational conclusion his digital mind can reach.
"**…Thank you, Captain Skullwire, sir. We admit it was… a satisfying display of demolitions.**" Servo stumbles, unsure of a proper response.
[*System diagnostic summary… self-destruct mechanisms still active…*]
Not doubting that had the detonite been insufficient the good Captain would have probably used Servo's chassis as additional explosive material, he decides now is not the time to ask about having it removed. He does recall something about "*reaping the rewards*" of this mission, but it seems inappropriate to mention that as well.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-09 18:06:07)

The huge droid captains photoreceptors sweeps over the crew, and after a few moment the amassed laughter that Servo is now getting used to erupts once again. Once it settles down a bit, Skullwire turns back to the scrap droid.
**"Did Buckler leave the restraining bolt stuck on you? Don´t be so modest, you are one of us now, and there´s a reason we rule these spacelanes. Now get your bolted behind over to the armory so he can set you up proper"**
Once again raising his cannon arm and firing into the roof, Skullwire raises the volume of his speakers notably.
**"And the rest of you, power down if you need to, for in five hours, we will make the next catch of the day"**
With those word, the crew scatters, going about their business. Unfortunately, one of them seems to have the sad job of fixing the dents in the hangar ceiling after Skullwires shooting. A simple, bipedal design, the unit lacks any kind of advanced accessories that could help in the work, and if a droids face could mimic an organic bored to death with his job, this droid did it.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-16 12:09:53)

[*Power levels adequate…*]
Servo checks his power level before searching out Buckler. His optics rest on the droid cleaning up the blast crater on the hull for just a moment. Certainly everyone aboard has a purpose, some more exciting than others. Satisfied that his current charge will hold for several hours, Servo sets off to find Buckler.
As he treads through the corridors and hatchways of the ship, Servo begins to think back to Raxus Prime. So many of his shipmates would fit right in among the mountains of discarded parts and pieces. Even Captain Skullwire himself, rough though he may be, would probably get along nicely in one of the ports or outposts that dot the planet. He also remembers how he got aboard the *Rusty Blade* though - not a situation he wants to repeat. Further calculations lead him to conclude that while his shield generator provides adequate defense it is unlikely his blaster pistol would serve as a very effective offensive tool. His programming might suggest something more covert - similar to the work he had just done. His skills as mechanic could be used to disable all sorts of things though, not just communications. Surely an organic crew would be even more efficiently dispatched if Servo were allowed to somehow sneak aboard and shutdown life support.
Captain Skullwire must have tried that at least once, and Servo concludes he has far more effective plans and more experience than he could ever formulate anyway. As he rounds a bend in the passage way, it looks as though Buckler's station is just a few meters away.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-18 16:28:54)

After looking around for a moment, Servo finds himself back in the armory, greeted by the same maintenance droid as before.
**"Observation: So, I see you made it through your first mission in one piece. Good for you. Try to keep it that way, will you? It´s been a long time since we had a more permanent addition to the crew"**
Moving back into the armory and cracking up a crate that Servo recognizes as one taken from the raided freighter, Buckler starts to rummage through its contents.
**"Query: I´m assuming that you´ve come here for your share of the loot, am I right?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-05-18 20:40:21)

"**Yes, we recall Captain Skullwire mentioned that. Additionally, he suggested we have this,**" Servo taps a mechanical digit on the restraining bolt still affixed to his chassis, "**removed as well. We are unsure if all crew still have the remote explosives wired into their systems or if we should expect that to be uninstalled as well - you would know better.**"
It would be a comfort knowing his liberal interpretation of orders could no longer result in his immediate demolition. Servo enjoyed - if a droid could experience such a thing - his last mission, and was curious to fulfill other roles aboard the *Rusty Blade*. He had insufficient data to calculate what sort of "loot" to expect, but while the maintenance droid rummaged, he continued...
"**So you are designation Buckler. We are called Servo. We, too, hope to remain a permanent addition to the crew. We are curious - is there any indication as to the nature of our next target?**"
Servo had never imagined himself as part of a ship's crew, much less a "private contractor". Life amongst the rubble on Raxus Prime was all he'd ever known. It was a simple existence, perforated by the occasional excitement whenever encountering a malicious junk droid or roaming band of Jawa scavengers. Something about taking part in what was going on here troubled him, like an incessant repeating decimal with no discernible pattern. His calculations couldn't reveal it, an organic might call it "a gut feeling" - a term his merchant friend Meldo Selkin often used.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-29 16:16:25)

The maintenance droid pauses for a moment to look at Servo, as if puzzled somehow.
**"Probing Query: Did the captain say to remove the restraining bolt? I have not received any such instructions, and it would seem odd indeed, given that new recruits generally keep their bolts on for a while. Though if he did say so, I suppose I could double check…"**
Letting the sentence trail off, Buckler continues his rummaging through shelves and scrolling through data screens.
**"Explanation: The hotwired ordnance systems does not operate solely as a way to keep new recruits in check, but they also provides an ultimate failsafe against compromise in the event one crewmember is ever captured. We are currently short on hardware, but as soon as it is possible we should have a memory backup of your systems made, in case they ever have to be activated"**
Finally stopping with his neurotic movements and workings, he moved over to the counter again.
**"Statement: Now then, if we shall get down to business. The captain has ordered that your frame be buckled up a bit, so I guess we should see to that eh? Now the shield generator I provided should help you in a pinch, but it tends to cause mayhem on all sorts of systems, especially targeting sensors, so its not really a very optimal solution. Unfortunately I don´t have any proper generator available, but I do have a personal micro shield that might be handy. I also suppose I could bolt a few durasteel plates over vital areas to cover up the worst holes. No offense, but you obviously weren´t built for our line of work"**
((
Ok, so I´m in the process of creating some new systems for the game, but in the meantime I can simplify for you to say that you´re being offered to have some armor plating added. The exact combination of plating is a bit flexible but Buckler is capable of most forms of Light and Medium armors, and have the capacity to use the Tech Specialist feat. You will also be offered a choice of some piece of the loot to be added to your systems, as soon as I compile a list of appropriate choices.
))

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-05 19:58:46)

*OK, here´s the deal. You will get a one-time grant of 5000 Cr to use for upgrade purchasing. In addition, you get 1000 Cr for your part in the mission, giving you a total of 6k. You can choose pretty much any droid upgrade you want that falls in the category of protecting or sensory upgrades, as determined by us discussing it. The Micro Shield I mentioned before costs 600 Cr and gives you a +1 deflection bonus to Reflex Defense. Otherwise you can use stuff like droid armor or shields, sensor upgrades, and like I said Buckler can also perform Tech Specialist modifications.*

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-19 06:30:31)

It sure takes a while, as indicated by Servos internal clock, and when he is finally reactivated, he finds himself lying on the same operations table he had been placed on when Buckler first brought him into the more greasy parts of his mechanics hangout. Bringing most if his systems back online, he finds new data feeds coming in, suggesting that Buckler had thrown in some additional sensor systems while he was at it. Stepping down from the table, he finds himself toppling a bit to the side, and he feels that his frame have indeed been "buckled up", and his internal systems will most likely require a minute or two to adjust themselves to the added weight.
When a metallic banging sound causes him to turn his head, he spots Buckler entering the room.
**"Observation: Ah, I see you´ve recovered. Usually puts in a few hours of hardware controlled shutdown after modifications have been made, to allow things to settle. You needed to recharge anyway. I see you´ve noted the added weight - don´t worry, you´ll get used to it"**
Moving over to a bench, the droid continues his habit of talking to his customers while working.
**"Information: I guess you are interested to know the specifics of the modifications made to your frame, yes? I rummaged around a bit and found a few things that seemed useful, plus I nicked a few pieces from the loot you guys brought home.
First, most of the added weight you´ll notice comes from the armor plating I bolted on, though you´re in luck. I though you´d be stuck with the same bulky durasteel that most people around here sports, but I found something I think you´ll like lying around in the shop. It´s a denser polymer alloy infused with rare stygium crystals. I don´t know where the hell we picked that up, but I managed to refit it to your chassis anyway. In addition to protecting you, those crystals have a tendency to cause static in various surveillance or detection devices, so don´t get alarmed if you experience some glitching in your photoreceptors in the coming hours.
Second, I installed a few auxilliary batteries to smooth power flows to your more active parts, increasing overall efficiency by 14,2%. This will be able to compensate for the added weight of the armor, and should overall make you more mobile and durable as your parts will be able to function better under duress. I also put that Micro Shield I had lying around on your arm, just as a measure of extra protection.
Third, I threw in some things I found among the loot, sensor boosters and stuff, including some enhanced photoreceptors that should give you some nightvision. I hope this will compensate for whatever static those blasted stygium crystals causes, but don´t take my word for it. I also bolted some extra plates over your shutdown switch, standard measurement against capture of crew members"**
Finished putting a slew of tools in a small cloth wrapping, he throws the package at Servo.
**"Addendum: If you have any questions, please take them to someone else, since I´m very busy at the moment. The captain requested that you be given a tool kit, as you seems to have some skills in mechanics, and I think he´ll be wanting to use those in future raids"**
((
Wow, that got long, so I´ll just shorten it here. Any questions, send them in a PM or in the OOC section. Let me know when you´ve updated your sheet.

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-19 12:35:32)

Servo listens intently to Buckler's words and begins to run his own self-diagnostic subroutines:
[*Analyzing new systems…compensating gyro-stabilizers for inertial changes…sensor suite online…programming augmented…*]
He lifts his arms slowly and tests the joints, flexing each mechanical digit in turn. He bends his knees and swivels his head, further allowing for the weight of added internal systems and exterior plating. Altogether Servo is quite pleased with Buckler's work and calculates a ten-fold increase in his survival rate during future raids, though his appearance has changed radically. He stores the tool kit in his right arm compartment with his spare energy cells and checks the energy shield strapped just above it, then tests the micro shield on his other arm. The blaster pistol is still secure with his left arm's storage space.
[*Conclusion…systems now operating at 99.3% efficiency…0.7% decrease in visual input due to armor plating…maximum time to fully adjust is 2.76 hours…*]
"**Thank you, friend Buckler, I -**" Servo pauses, unused to the new language patterns that seem to have been an unexpected result of the re-programming, "**… I am thankful for your improvements.**" With a nod of gratitude the reborn droid makes his way slowly to the main hangar bay. His short-term memory had been inactive for several hours, but he did recall that another raid was due soon and Servo was anxious to test his new limits. His optics were reading much clearer images and, despite the occasional static interference from his unique armor plating, he found that he was able to see in lower lighting levels without penalty.
Servo remembers a time not too long ago when being in the dark was to his distinct disadvantage. The results - his being disabled, captured by Jawa scavengers and sold to Skullwire - had not been foreseen at all. He was excited to be a part of something larger and serving aboard the *Rusty Blade* was certainly never going to be dull.

I messaged you about the armor's weight, the rest of Servo's sheet should be correct. Ready when you are! ![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-23 17:28:44)

As Servo reaches the hangar, he finds the activity there to be modest at the very least. A few crewmembers working on hauling some cargo around, but otherwise it was relatively peaceful. Skullwire was nowhere to be seen, though he did notice a new addition to the hangar. A smaller transport ship was landed at the far end of the area, an aged *Wayfarer*-class transport from what he could tell.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-10-24 11:06:16)

Anxious both to utilize his new sensor package and to discover what has transpired during his maintenance period Servo begins to study the transport. He scans the ship as best he can, walking around it in the bay and then inquiring from some of shipmates. He approaches one of the droids working with cargo and asks:
"**Greetings fellow crewmate! I am curious,**" Servo reflects on a time when he referred to himself in the plural and welcomes the unexpected side-effect of Buckler's upgrades, "**do you know - does that ship belong to Captain Skullwire or do we have visitors?**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Perception +12**, and I'd like to take twenty if that's alright. Servo is walking all the way around the ship and actively trying to determine any distinct markings (designation, combat damage, etc.), if there is a crew aboard and is it friendly, and anything regarding its contents be looking through any reasonable viewed windows and ramps (if extended). I don't think it's appropriate for him to spend hours on the **Gather Information** act so I'll roll for that. I'll include a **Persuasion** as well.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-26 20:23:00)

The ship is rather unremarkable in itself, and as Servo takes a closer look at it, he cannot register any transponder signals broadcasting any identity of the ship. This would suggest that the ship either have some sort of systems malfunction, or has had its transponder deactivated, a common move among vessels operating on the more shady side of the law. As he moves around to the far side of the ship, he notices that the port side appears to be little more than an attached cargo module of sorts, and some digging in library files suggests this to be a standard trait of the somewhat aged *Wayfarer* model. The ship appears to be in a state of shutdown, with ramps closed and systems powered down, and if there is any cremwmbers on board, Servos sensors cannot detect them.
As Servo approaches him, the labor droid puts down the crate he is carrying, and turns to observe the newcomer.
**"Ah, the new recruit I see. Must be, as everyone else would recognize the ship of YV-558. The old junkpile crosses paths with us every now and then, and the captain usually sees fit to bring him aboard for some exchange of information and goods. Nice guy if you ask me, but let´s just say I think he´s gone a bit too long without a memory wipe"**
((
OK so the Perception check I got, but the rest I´m not sure about. The Gather Information check I just dropped, since you´d have gotten pretty much the same info by asking all droids in the hangar as just asking one. The Persuasion check I have no idea what it was for...so yeah. Rule of thumb, when you include a skill check, be sure to include what it´s for, ok? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

"**Ah yes, I understand. Thank you very much. Sorry to have interrupted.**"
Servo gives the droid a nod of gratitude and sets off to find the captain. He hasn't received any instruction as to what his duties are in "peacetime" and it's a good excuse to investigate this YV-558. The title would seem to be a designation and not a name, indicating either another droid or some sort of soldier - perhaps both. Servo was quickly learning the galaxy was a big place and there were still many things he didn't understand. Wandering through the corridors of the *Rusty Blade* his optics begin to acclimate to his new armor.
[*Systems now at 99.6% efficiency…visual input interference decreased to 0.4%…re-calculating original estimates to full system efficiency…*]
All his shipmates appear to have specific roles on board - even the one tasked with cleaning the hull after one of Captain Skullwire's rousing speeches - and Servo is anxious (or the nearest droid equivalent) to discover what his would be.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-10-31 19:21:21)

**"No problem"**
The droid returns to its work with normal efficiency, barely seeming to recognize it had been disturbed. As he runs the designation through his data archives, Servo reaches the conclusion that the YV designation most likely refers to the *YVH*-series of battle droids commissioned a century ago to fight the Yuuzhan Vong invasion force. Details of such an old model are sketchy in his files, but they are definitely designated as battle droids.
As he walk down the corridors of the *Blade* trying to find the captain, another droid approaches him. Like many of the droids aboard the ship, it is hard to identify its model, as it has been modified and adjusted beyond recognition, but it does seem like one of the less armed of Skullwire´s henchmen.
**"Hey newbie, you busy?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-02 10:11:51)

Servo pauses as his shipmate approaches and considers his remark.
[*Noobee…unknown term…context clues indicate a title given to a novice, rookie, beginner, uninitiated…this title applies to Servo's service aboard the Rusty Blade…*]
"**Greetings! I was on my way to find our captain and inquiry as to my regular duties here. In that respect, yes, I was "busy". If you need help, or have a task for me, then I believe I am available. I am Servo. What did you have in mind?**"
Finding work while looking for Captain Skullwire to assign him work strikes Servo as serendipitous and he is pleased to be acknowledged by the crew - even if there was a transition time regarding his title.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-09 09:07:09)

The droid nods and makes a gesture for Servo to follow him, talking as he walked.
**"We need to make some adjustments to the sensor dishes before the next raid, and we need someone on the outside to calibrate the external relays. Have you ever worked on capital ship systems before?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-09 14:52:12)

Servo blinks his optics, considering the request for a moment before responding.
"**I have worked on a great many systems in the past, from the smallest mechanism to the largest machine the galaxy can reasonably offer a humble droid mechanic. I am also quite capable of working on starship hulls, in fact I believe this is the reason I was brought aboard this vessel in the first place. Calibrating the external relays would be my pleasure.**"
Servo can barely contain his excitement at a duty fitting his aptitudes, but waits for a response before running out of the nearest airlock in case there are any additional instructions. Last time he was near a communications array it was to blow it up and he doesn't want that to happen again - unless it's under orders.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-11-09 20:17:52)

**"Good, follow me then"**
The other droid brings Servo along to a nearby airlock, located near the ships midsection.
**"Normally, we would handle these adjustments from the inside or via less effective means on the hull, but since you were so readily equipped, the captain suggested we make the adjustment properly this time. You see the captain has ordered a raid on one of them Vong caravans drifting around this section of space, and the sensor apparatus behaves oddly when it comes in contact with them organic vessels. Skullwire wants to make sure that we are all ready to hit those blasted aliens where it hurts the most"**
Pressing the controls to a room located next to the airlock, he enters, and Servo can see that it seems to be a control station of some sorts.

---

### **BWS2K** (2011-11-16 16:56:03)

"***Organic* ships**!"
The very notion of a ship not comprised of steel plates, computer systems and endless wiring shocked Servo. The majority of his memory was devoted to his days on Raxus Prime - an entire planet virtually composed of machine parts.
He follows the droid to the airlock and examined the controls. Not wanting to open the hatch until it was safe to do so, he waits for a signal from the control station.
"**Ready when you are!**"

So this will be a Mechanics roll or something? Or should I expect a Vong ambush...? ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

**"We´re all set here. Off you go"**
((
Sorry about the lame response, but I figured you could do a better job of describing how Servo gets out there and how he experiences it. I´ll just take this to prime you on what´s going on.
You can expect whatever you wish, I´ll hopefully not be doing it. But anyway, this will be a Skill Challenge. That´s about all the information I´m giving you, the rest is up to you. Your objective, however, is to assist in the calibration of the sensor arrays. At least that´s your *current* objective...
BTW, in case you want some general idea of what the ship looks like, [this](http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=YZ-2500_heavy_transport&image=YZ2500-jpg "http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=YZ-2500_heavy_transport&image=YZ2500-jpg") is pretty much it. You´ll be exiting in the midsection, behind that front pair of wings, or whatever they are.

Servo activated the hatch controls and sensed the change in air pressure as the airlock opened to space. His magnetically modified footpads kept him from being ejected like the chamber's air supply and, other than compensating for the slight change in aerodynamic resistance, there was little concern for a droid like him working in vacuum. Reaching for the exterior handholds, he climbed out and onto the hull - always an intriguing experience. To consider that some droids lacked the necessary processing capabilities to fully appreciate the vastness of the cosmos seemed to Servo to be a great tragedy. He'd been on only one spacewalk that he could remember - his first mission aboard the *Rusty Blade* - and hadn't had the time to fully observe the stars unhindered. Perhaps it was his newly augmented optics, but it was now impossible for Servo to ever imagine staying on any planet for long when such beauty existed beyond atmosphere.
*Organic beings, even those that live for hundreds of years, will never be able to travel the stars the same way I can. I wonder if any droid has ever visited them all?*
Servo righted himself on the hull so that he could easily traverse the ship's metal skin and then stood. He spotted the sensor array and began to make his way across the durasteel plating, careful not to knock loose any panels as he walked. Captain Skullwire runs his ship with great authority and his crew is efficient to the uttermost but the remains of hastily repaired battle damaged pockmarked the hull beneath Servo's feet. At such close proximity one couldn't help but notice where the ship had taken hits from countless space hazards and weaponry. The *Rusty Blade* was no less lethal for it's age though, and having seen it in action he doubted the ship suffered in performance. In fact, Servo could understand that such a deceptive appearance might be desirable for... *private contractors*.
The modified protocol droid reached the main sensor array's maintenance box and opened it. Calibrating such delicate equipment while under way would be considered a near-impossible task for most, but Servo's life on Raxus Prime serves to prepare him for such odd circumstances. Indeed - he's quite grateful to be working with machinery already in operating condition and plugs his diagnostic leads into the box's primary interface to begin his task:
[*Diagnostics package online…interfacing with sensor array…calibration subroutines accessed…beginning calibration process…*]
Stored within the computer's memory are several different calibration settings, all clearly labeled digitally but most of which haven't been used in quite some time. It's not hard to verify that this is indeed the proper one. Servo watches as the dishes and antennae re-align into an optimal configuration for detecting organic vessels like the Yuuzhan Vong use. Once they have finished aligning he retracts the lead cable and begins to inspect the equipment itself. He identifies several minor adjustments that need to be made. Opening his right forearm compartment, Servo withdraws his newly acquired tool kit and sets about tightening, loosening, and correcting them all in turn. He works steadily - more concerned about getting it right than getting it done quickly - and ponders what meeting the Vong will be like.
Despite his sheltered beginnings on Raxus, even Servo had heard reports of the Yuuzhan Vong. Savage humanoid beings that had very nearly conquered the galaxy, they had a marked disdain for inorganic technology. They weren't primitive exactly - they had, after all, achieved hyper-travel - but rather religious fanatics who seemed to have built an entire society revolving around the practice of physical pain and genetic manipulation. Servo's own experiences were naturally limited and he wondered how much of what he had heard was true. He also wondered if he would be assigned a more frontline role in the upcoming raid or not. His magnetic feet weren't going to help much to cling to a living ship.
Satisfied that his adjustments were complete, he plugged back into the sensor's computer:
[*Sensor array calibrated to preset configuration **YV**…diagnostics routines running…*]
While the computer was running it's system checks, Servo used the ship's internal com-channel to check in with sensor control:
"**Sensor calibration is nearly complete. Are these settings satisfactory?**"

As Servo inputs the predetermined sensor calibration data into the system, he can hear the antennas and relays he was just working on groan and struggle against their holds. Well, not exactly hear perhaps, but his cognitive processing made him imagine such a sound as he saw one of the antennas bend slightly, and a few sparks fly from it. The comlink is silent for a few moments, then he can hear the voice of his instructor, slightly agitated.
**"What the…? The calibrations were loaded into the system, but the damn thing is completely off setting, only half in place. What are you doing up there?"**
It only takes a few steps for Servo to get back to the array cluster and realize he might have screwed those bolts in too tight. The moving of the antenna to adjust itself to the new calibration settings had strained against them and lost, resulting in the antenna now being stuck in place rather firmly.
**"Hey, see if there´s anything you can do to fix that dish while we figure out an alternate way to make this work"**
((
OK, so to summarize: Physically working on the arrays is Mechanics, Adjusting them via computers interfaces is Use Computer. You are allowed to use the same skills multiple times in the Skill Challenge, but they will only count once for each separate application.
For example, if you were to use Mechanics to fix your little screwup now, that´d be ok, but if you were to use it again to perform the same adjustments you did with the first check, I wouldn´t count it for the challenge again
))

### **BWS2K** (2011-12-19 14:09:29)

Servo's adjusts his optics in amazement at the bent antenna. As far as he could tell, he had done everything correctly.
"**Acknowledged.**"
The droid-mechanic-turned-pirate studies the fittings thoroughly, attempting to assess the damage. He decides finesse is no substitute for "elbow grease" (an odd phrase organics seem to use often in such situations) and grips the antenna tightly, twisting it slowly in place until it reaches it's proper orientation. Servo doesn't know much about the energy signatures of Yuuzhan Vong vessels - few of them ever made it to the surface of Raxus Prime. He considers asking for a status report before continuing but hesitates. Skullwire won't be impressed with his work so far.
[*Analysis mode initiated…speculative queries entered…possible alternate configurations…results pending…*]
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Two rolls: the first to try and fix the antenna using brute strength, the second to discover an alternate configuration that may end up working better than ever before (maybe to be represented as a bonus to a skill check as a final adjustment).
**Strength +3**
***6*** <- [3] 1d20 + 3
**Knowledge (technology) +8**
***19*** <- [11] 1d20 + 8
I'll add a Force Point if it makes a difference to either of those. If not, then I'll keep it. Let me know:
***1*** <- [1] 1d6
I was very tempted to use *Jury Rig* but I think I'd rather try and cover my mistake by making the sensors *really* good at detecting the YV in some other way. "**No that wasn't a mistake, I was fixing it…**" I'm not *actually* doing that yet, but I want to see if it's possible. I tried to keep it short, let me know what's up. I don't mind editing things in or out.

As Servo braces himself against the antenna, he pushes his internal servos quite hard, but the thing won´t budge. There´s probably a reason why a motorized system is used to turn them normally. Of course, there´s the possibility that simply loosening the bolts he just tightened would allow the dish to move easily again, provided that the previous failed movement didn´t bend anything too bad.
As he thinks about it for a moment, he does realize that it might be possible to use the antenna as it is to achieve decent performance by realigning the remaining dishes and sensor clusters to use that one as a central hub. With it locked so firmly in place, it might even offer a slight improvement in performance, though it could just as well be a liability as it cannot adjust properly to any movement of the ship.
((
Just as a future note, as per the rules you must make your decision to spend a Force Point before I tell you the result. So the fact that you rolled one here means that you used it. You are allowed to see the actual number rolled though, so you could first make a dice roll in your post, then check the number, and if you think a FP could be useful, you can edit it in. I´m not looking to be petty here, it´s just that I don´t like it if Force Points becomes "success points" which are only spent when they matter, and otherwise remains available.
Luckily for you, this time it actually helped <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
