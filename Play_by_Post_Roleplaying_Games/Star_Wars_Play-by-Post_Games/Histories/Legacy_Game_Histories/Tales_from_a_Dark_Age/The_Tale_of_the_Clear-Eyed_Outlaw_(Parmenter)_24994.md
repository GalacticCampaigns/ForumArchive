# The Tale of the Clear-Eyed Outlaw (Parmenter)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-02-27 18:37:21)

*Even in times as dark as these, supply lanes still need to be functional, which means that there will bee a need for ships to travel along them, and this in turn puts out a demand for captains to pilot those ships. With increased pirate activity though, many choose to fly under escort, even though this severely taxes their earnings. Still, it seems a better option than becoming another pirate victim.
Some though, considers it to be enough protection to rig a set of cannons and train some people to operate them. Others thinks even that is not necessary, boasting about their own skills, and considers the only defense they need is a good sublight drive. One such pilot is the Duros Doosra, who considers himself more than skilled enough to avoid some pirates, even when maneuvering something as bulky as an outdated and ill-maintained YT-1300. However, that´s what you get when you are cheap.
Doosra cruises the spacelanes with only an astromech droid as his crew. An Arkanian stowaway might have passed him completely by, though he might not have backed on the opportunity to take on a paying passenger either.
This is where our tale begins.* 
((It´s pretty much up to you whether you are a stowaway once again, or if you´re traveling legit this time))

***This is a fine mess, Jaya,*** she thinks to herself as she shifts her position again. Stowing aboard a tramp freighter was not an ideal situation for the young Arkanian. Her usual 'accommodations' were aboard larger transport vessels. But the failure of her last heist caused her to move up her departure from Corellia. This freighter happened to be the closest thing at the time, and while she might have been able to negotiate passage, she didn't have the time to do so. Instead she slipped on board while the ramp was raising.
The cramped nature of the freighter gave her few options when choosing a place to lay low. And as it was, the spot she chose happened to be next to a leaking hydraulic line. Her pants were thoroughly stained by the fluid, and the feel of it on her skin made her uncomfortable to say the least. Even with the discomfort Jaya would get an hour of sleep in now and again, a talent picked up from her time with the Wyverns. Long periods of sleep had been a rare occurrence when you had schedules to keep to.
As she awakes once again, she slips her hand down into her belt for a food capsule. ***One day gone,*** she reminds herself. ***I only wish I knew where I was headed.***
Actions:
Stealth +9 to hide/stay hidden

Without any viewports in the cargo bay, it is hard to tell what is happening on the outside, but the familiar shudder of the ship some hours ago tells Jaya that the ship has entered hyperspace. Even so the ship still shuddered and shook - though less - but that was just a testimony to the overall poor condition of the ship. She had noticed it upon entering, the vessel was not like some of the YT-1300´s she had seen. It was an old model, but if kept in shape it worked just fine. This pilot however, seemed not to care too much about that, and the ship´s exterior gave the phrase "hunk of junk" a new meaning.
She had been left comfortably alone though. The pilot apparently wasn´t very concerned with checking in on his cargo, and his astromech sidekick had been rather absent. It wasn´t obvious what was in the cargo, as most of it were stocked in unmarked cargo crates, though she could also spot several containers that seemed designed to carry some sort of liquid. The cargo bay was pretty stocked though, and finding good hiding spots were not hard at all.

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-01 12:46:41)

With no information about the ships destination, or for that matter the length of the trip, she decides to investigate her ride a little further. Her food supply would be depleted in short order, so another food supply would surely help. The cargo bay's relative quiet since their departure leads Jaya to believe that her pilot is self-assured over his cargo and therefore has no desire to check on it. Oddly, despite the repercussions of being discovered by the duro at the helm, she's more afraid of being discovered by his astromech assistant. Still, necessity and curiosity win the argument as to what Jaya's next moments will entail.
Leaving the puddle of hydraulic fluid, she moves across the hold to inspect the cargo she shares the room with. ***Who knows,*** she assures herself, ***maybe I can cut my losses from that last debacle.***
Actions:
Perception +9 (being aware of any noise coming closer)
Stealth +9 (to hide in the event of something)
Perception +9 (to search the cargo starting with the crates)
OOC: Do you want me to roll, because I'm fine with having you doing it?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-01 16:20:52)

Quietly leaving her hiding place, Jaya starts to examine the contents of the cargo bay. Starting with the box-shaped ones, she finds them to be tightly locked down and unmarked with regards to contents. She does manage to identify the logo on many of the crates as the logo of KDY - Kuat Drive Yards, one of the major starship and arms manufacturers in the Galaxy, having been a major player on the field for millennium. As she inspects the containers seemingly more for transporting liquids - given their cylindrical shapes - she notices several warning signs. Even though she isn´t knowledgeable enough in the field, it seems safe enough to assume that are not filled with drinking water.
((
In this kind of situation, it doesn´t really matter to me who rolls, but in cases where you can resolve a roll on your own, such as when you know the DC for a check, I think it saves some time if you roll the dice.
))

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-01 23:46:02)

***Hmm? Why would the Kuat Drive Yards entrust anything of theirs to a ship like this? Maybe I'm not the only thief on board.*** A smile crosses her face, as a daring idea formulates. Reaching into her boot she removes her stunner and activates it. Perhaps not the smartest of plans, but sitting in the cargo hold of this flimsy starship any longer was going to take it's toll on her. ***A ship of my own would undoubtedly help my business. This one doesn't seem like it'll be missed too badly.*** With thoughts of piracy in mind, Jaya begins to roam the ship stalking her prey. She hopes to find the pilot unaware, but with him and the droid, it'll be unlikely that she can strike without prior detection. Still, she has surprise on her side, for the moment.
Actions:
Draw stunner.
Stealth +9 (just sneaking until she finds someone)
Perception +9 (keeping her senses open)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-03 11:23:47)

As she made her way between the cargo crates, she pulls out a few simple tool. Breaking open the control panel´s cover and performing a few "modifications", the door slides open without much fuss. Outside, she finds a larger room, and there are actually some lights on. A quick look around shows her the engineering bay, and she notices the cargo lift in the floor which she had used to sneak aboard the ship. Lining the walls is the ships massive array of sublight engine drives, inert at the moment, and at the other end of the room she spots the hyperdrive unit, humming a little louder than a well-maintained might.
Still, apart from the humming of the hyperdrive, she can hear nothing.

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-04 02:14:07)

With her own expertise, and the aid of her multi-tool, Jaya makes quick work of the cargo hold door. The door slides open, however, Jaya lets a moment linger before emerging into the next room. ***Let them think that it malfunctioned*** Jaya told herself ***Probably would have too, if I'd waited long enough*** Stepping into the engineering bay, she takes note of the ships systems that are visible. The lights visible give Jaya further consideration as to how she'll go about her plan. If she could remove the ambient lighting it might give her an edge in whatever fight she might be heading into, and perhaps bring her prey to her.
Actions: Going to attempt to turn out the lights. If that occurs, stealth once again to hide, and see what happens.

***19*** <- [19] 1d20

Mechanics +16/Use Computer +11 (whichever is applicable)

***6*** <- [6] 1d20

Stealth +9

***2*** <- [2] 1d20

Perception +9

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-04 15:58:50)

Taking a few moments to find the right cable, a quick slice from the blade on her multitool causes the ships internal lighting to fail completely, and both the room she´s in and the corridor outside is now filled with darkness. From somewhere distant on the ship, she can hear a series of words in a language unfamiliar to her uttered, but she doesn´t really need to understand them to get their meaning. Pressing up against the wall next to the opening into the engineering bay, she can hear the sounds of something rolling her way on the deck, though she can´t really tell how far away.

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-06 20:11:48)

Cutting the power, that was the easy part. What happens next, however, was going to be the real test of all that Jaya had learned. She needs to take down another living being, as well as an astromech. If she fails, he'll likely space her, or if she is lucky, hand her over to the authorities. Still, the rewards weigh heavily against the risks. With her stunner in hand, she waits for the chance to make her move. If the astromech is en route, maybe she can slip by it and make her way to the cockpit. If not, she'll probably need to resort to her blaster at that point. An ion weapon of sorts would certainly be handy at the moment, but she had had little use for one in the past. Maybe this will give her cause to reconsider that decision.
Actions:
Sneak past the droid: Stealth +9
Failing that, she'll strike it with the stunner: Initiative +9; Attack +4; Damage 1d4+3

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-07 16:36:31)

Jaya waits patiently as she hears the sound of the astromech coming closer. As it rolls into the engineering bay, it comes to a quick halt, and its dome-shaped head swirls around, and she finds its primary red photoreceptor looking straight at her. Not wasting a moment, she lunges forward and swings her stunner at it. Her target moves with surprising speed though, and her weapon bounces off one of its reinforced "leg" appendages. The cylindrical little droid gives away a high-pitched stream of beeps and boops, which must echo throughout the entire ship, and somewhere Jaya can hear a similarly raised series of curses and surprise.
A side panel opens loose on the screaming droid, and a small probe is extended that suddenly sparks with an electric charge. As Jaya jumps back a few steps to avoid the charge, the droid seizes its chance and starts to roll out into the hallway.

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-08 13:29:53)

**"Stang!"** Jaya curses through her teeth. Things were falling apart fast, and she was walking on the charred remains of the bridge she'd just burned. Ideas flashed into her head, good and bad and useless. She could hide her things and pretend to have been put here. There was no time. She could stop the fight now and ask for forgiveness. Unlikely, she's proven herself untrustworthy already. She could draw her six-shooter, and hope for the best. At least it has a margin of success in it. Plan formulated, Jaya springs into action. Dropping her stunner she reaches behind for her hold-out, and shoots at the little droid.
Actions: This is assuming that "moves into the hallway" means he isn't running away. If it does, let me know and I'll edit this into something else if it doesn't work for you.
Swift - Drop stunner.
Move - Draw hold-out blaster.
Standard - Attack with hold-out +5 + (+2 from Find Openings) = +7, Damage 3d4+2

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-09 04:02:56)

Dropping her stunner to the floor, Jaya pulls out her blaster and takes aim at the small cylindrical droid as it rolls out of the room. Pulling the trigger, the blaster bolt streaks through the air and hitting the swirling dome of the astromech. The pitch of the droid rises a notch as a small explosion causes the dome to nearly fall off in a shower of sparks and smoke, and then ends as it rolls straight into the wall of the corridor and falls over.
Jaya can now hear rapid footsteps coming down the corridor the droid was heading into, and the light of a glow rod comes shining from around the bend in the corridor, and a highly upset voice screams at her.
**"Alright, who´s there? Come out with your hands above your head, or I´m taking you down"**
((
Well technically it did mean he was running away, but the entrance to the engineering bay (where you are) has a wide entrance, so you still had a shot.
))

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-11 01:10:30)

Jaya felt remorse at the destruction of the R2 unit. Her plan wasn't to harm anyone or thing, for that matter, just to steal what obviously isn't appreciated. Still, maybe she could fix him when this is all over with. A voice calling out, and the sound of footfalls coming closer bring her back to the present. The Duro captain is coming, and now he knows someone is aboard his ship. There is little time to think, let alone act. As much as she wants to, she doesn't see any turning back from what she needs to do now. It is him or her, and she knows where her loyalties lay, along with a fair guess about his. Her heart races as she moves back into the cargo hold. She slides up to the door and watches the next room, waiting for the glowrod's light to enter. She brings her blaster to bear on the entrance the droid had come from. ***This is it.***
Actions:
Move - Move back into the cargo hold taking cover.
Ready(Standard) - Attack with blaster +5; damage 3d4+2; when he comes through the entrance to engineering.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-13 03:34:10)

Slipping back into the cargo hold, Jaya can hear another string of curses, and she suspects the captain of the ship must have found his R2 unit. In a matter of moments she can see the light of a glow rod shine into the engineering room. As she sees the tall and wiry Duros captain walk into the room, she pulls the trigger. The shot goes off a little too early though, and the shot streaks right in front of the captain and slams into the wall. The Duros draws himself back out into the corridor.
Putting his head out again, the Duros fires a shot from a blaster pistol towards Jaya. The shot strikes into the wall she is hiding behind, leaving a scorching mark. The cone of light from the glow rod centers on the entrance to the cargo hold, and Jaya can´t help but feel a sense of entrapment.

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-16 13:04:47)

Jaya jumps at the sound of the blaster bolt hitting the wall behind her. Though capable, a fire fight isn't something she's confident about. The light coming through the entrance tells her he's keeping watch, waiting for a shot. With quick movement she leans out, scans and shoots. ***Three shots left*** she reminds herself. He's backed her into a corner, and there's little she can do but keep fighting.
Actions:
Attack +7 (5 +2[Find Openings]) hold-out (3d4+2)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-16 16:07:46)

Jaya´s shot strikes the edge of the outer entrance to the engineering bay just as the Duros pokes his head out. Quickly withdrawing it, she can hear his voice again.
**"I don´t know who you are, but you´re messing with the wrong captain. Even though working for the KDY doesn´t give you any discount on ship armament, they do give you some nifty little gadgets for self defense"**
Jaya can see him appear again in the doorway, and pulls her head back. As she does so, she hears a clanking sound and as she looks down, a small metallic sphere rolls into the cargo hold barely a meter from her. Instead of exploding though, tick, white smoke starts to flow out from the grenade. As the smoke wraps around her, she can feel it sticking in her lungs and eyes, and her throat begins to dry up.
((
Jaya has taken 5 damage and moved to -1 on the Condition Track. You can get out of the smoke by moving as far as possible into the cargo hold if you want to.
))

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-21 13:09:41)

The burning suppresses all other cognitive obligations. The only remaining thought is to make it stop. Coughing involuntarily removes neither the burning, or the smoke that surrounds her waiting to have its go at hurting her. Never having been a real fighter, Jaya gives in. Throwing her weapon out of the cargo hold she runs deeper in to escape the gaseous assailant. **"Please. Please stop."** She beckons to the man on the outside. Fear rushes her mind like a vacuum leak on a ship, soon it fills her with a void. ***What's going to happen now?!*** Those few words keep repeating, endlessly, as she imagines the possibilities of what's to happen next. How could he ever forgive her?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-21 16:34:11)

Running into the deepest corner of the cargo hold, not far from where she began her trip, Jaya finds a small pocket of fresh air. Pretty much all around her though she finds thick smoke. From outside in the engineering bay, she hears a harsh voice calling out to her.
**"Don´t be such a wuzz, it´s just smoke. KDY does not issue gas grenades to their contractors. Though you sure as hell would deserve it. Now are you going to get out of there or will I have to drag you out?"**

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-24 12:04:49)

Waiting a moment for the smoke to dissipate, Jaya then starts walking toward the entrance. **"I'm coming out now."** She calls out, as she raises her hands in front of her. The smoke causes a few more coughs as she passes the entrance to the hold. Stopping just outside the cargo hold, she avoids eye contact with the man who captured her. Even during her time with the pirates, she had only fired a blaster at their impromptu shooting range as practice. Never has she tried to kill another person before. The whole incident leaves her feeling empty inside, like she had traded some part of herself away for this ship only to find out even that wasn't enough. Ashamed of what she's done, she waits for him to make the next move.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-24 17:03:13)

As she exits the smoke-filled cargo hold, Jaya finds herself with the light cone of a blaster pistol in her face. With a wave of the blaster in his hand, the Duros captain ushers her out more into the clear where he can get a better look at her.
**"So, just what did you hope to accomplish with this stunt little girl? Theft? Murder? Hijacking perhaps? Bah, it doesn´t matter anyway. You see, some of us cares about laws, which means I can´t just shoot you on the spot. So you´ll spend the rest of the trip locked up inside the hold until we get to our destination, and there you´ll be turned over to the authorities, understood?"**
Taking a look around, he waved his pistol and glow rod towards the console on the wall.
**"But first, you better fix that damn light!"**

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-03-28 22:53:42)

Jaya nods subserviently to both the explanation and the demand. Slowing reaching for her multi-tool, she shows it to him, then proceeds to strip the two wires to reconnect them. **"To be honest, I saw your cargo and assumed you had stolen it. And when I saw how poorly you kept your ship I felt that it needed to be liberated. I'm sorry for the mess, and your droid."** Once again, she reaches slowly for a pocket. **"Before we get to port, here is all the money I have on me."** Handing him her last 500 credits. **"I know you must hate me, and not trust me, but I could try to fix your droid while I'm locked away."**
Actions:
Mechanics +16 to fix the lights
Persuasion +11 to change attitude

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-01 13:27:10)

**"Oh, that´s clever girl, add insult to the rest of the damage you´ve caused. Get back in the hold with you"**
Apparently not one to ease up that easily, the Duros captain waves his pistol to usher Jaya back inside the cargo hold where the smoke have now begun to clear out. Giving her a hard shove to get her inside he hits the controls and the door slams shut around her, and once again she finds herself sitting alone in the cargo hold of the battered YT-1300.
While in such a position, it is easy to lose track of time, but she estimates that several hours at the very least must have passed before she suddenly feels the ship shudder and shake. While a quick guess would tell her that the ship have left hyperspace, it all felt very rough. Then again, the ship she is on isn´t sporting the most cutting edge technology, including hyperdrive. A few moments later though, she can feel the ship rock heavily, but the cause is anyones guess.
((
After some thinking on the situation at hand, I´ve decided to award Jaya with a Dark Side Score increase.
))

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-04-04 22:32:10)

Moving toward the locked door, she shouts a complaint in Durese. **"The ship wouldn't shake apart if you'd just do some regular maintenance on it."** She begins pacing around the hold, waiting for his inevitable return. It had been a number of years since she'd had a serious run-in with the authorities. And then, all she'd done was steal some food. Now, she'd have some serious charges put against her. She's afraid of what the next few days will hold in store for her.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-06 16:48:35)

The ship rocks heavily again, and then falls uncomfortably silent. Inside the cargo old Jaya can´t hear much, but it is disturbing that the ship does not make any sound at all. Usually when traveling through space, you can at least hear some kind of sound in the ship, be it just the humming of the hyperdrive or the ship hull straining against the powers exerted on it while traveling at high velocity.
Suddenly though, a sharp sound catches her attention, as it sounds like it´s coming from just outside the cargo hold. A second powerful bang makes her certain that it is coming from outside the hold.

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-04-10 14:16:13)

Along with the ship, Jaya falls silent. ***What's going on?*** A thought that crosses her mind, while she brings an ear up to the cargo hold door. She hears nothing, not the sickly hum of this engine, or the sound of thrusters maneuvering them through the dead of space. A sharp bang outside the door causes her to back away with a start. Before she can think of answers for the questions coming out of her head, a second one causes her to jump again. ***Something is not right here.*** Without much thought, Jaya slowly backs away from the mystery to return to her hydraulic fluid puddle back in the corner of the hold. As it stood, she had little she could do but wait.
Actions: Stealth +9

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-12 10:19:43)

As Jaya steps back from the second sharp bang, she can hear the mechanics of the cargo hold door work, and before she has stepped many meters back it slides open. She found herself looking at a tall, armored individual, encased in red and black armor with a bandolier across the chest. Standing a few paces behind the first is a second one, busy replacing some tools in a belt pouch. And given the rifle barrel that appears quickly, trained straight between her eyes, it is safe to say that they have spotted Jaya as well.
**"Hold it right there!"**
The voice coming from the closest individual sounds almost mechanic, as she is signaled to come out into the cargo hold.

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-04-13 11:21:49)

Trying to make a hasty retreat to the sanctuary of her hiding spot, she is instead discovered. As the rifle muzzle rises so does her hands, until they are comically straight up. **"Okay, okay, don't shoot."** The assailant waves the blaster around motioning for her to join them in the main body of the ship. With little hesitation she walks toward the two armored men. ***Well, this is a fine mess Treiden, what now?*** Walking into the Engineering area, she looks around cautiously trying to take in the situation. From her past experiences she would think these men are pirates, but under whose flag did they fly under though? **"Wu-what do you want?"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-13 17:49:04)

Moving out into the engineering bay, Jaya gets a closer look at the two armored soldiers. Their crimson and black armor is complemented by bandoliers and a number of bags and pockets hanging from their belts. The blaster rifles they carries has a basic resemblance with regular, low-powered rifles normally allowed as personal arms, but she also notes that they seems to be modified in ways that makes their legality quite questionable. Nowhere can she see any symbols or insignias though that would indicate their identities.
Once she has gotten out into the light, one of the gives her a light rap at the back of her knees, enough to make them bend and cause her to fall over.
**"Sir, we found a stowaway hidden in the cargo hold!"**
Jaya heard approaching footsteps coming from the corridor outside, and as she looked up, she found herself looking up at a tall figure with distinctive avian traits. She could spot white hair covering parts of his body and face, and he was wearing a light dress of somewhat oriental design. While she couldn´t see them completely, she could catch glimpses of a set of large metallic blades strapped to his back.
**"Well, well…now who might you be young lady. We had not heard that the Duros would be traveling with company"**

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-04-14 11:48:34)

On her hands and knees, she looked up in an awkward manner to the men surrounding her. Letting her head fall she spoke. **"I… I'm just a mechanic Doosra hired to fix his droid and do some repairs during the flight. It was a last minute arrangement, and I was looking for passage off-world."** Raising her head for eye contact again, she continued. **"I didn't realize it was such a bad deal at the time."** Her last words were of course in reference to the predicament at hand. The story itself was false, but believable give the poor condition of the ship. It was also a gamble, she didn't know what to fear more: association with the Duro, or reveal herself to be a stowaway, a nobody. **"He locked me in the cargo hold, told me to hide when he realized what was happening. D… Di… Is he dead?"** Fear was one thing she could not fake at a time like this.
((
Deception +8
))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-14 18:51:37)

**"Don´t lie to me girl. It makes you look bad. And no, the Duros is not dead, but when he wakes up he will do so with a less well-filled ship. Curious though is that he made no mention of you. Anyway, it does not matter"**
With a few quick gestures, the avian creature ordered the rest of the men back to work, and joined by a few other wearing the ragtag uniforms of mercenaries, they started to unload the cargo hold. They operated with speed and efficiency, and where obviously not novices at what they were doing. Overseeing their work, the avian creature helped Jaya to her feet.
**"I know your people are skilled engineers, and there might be something you can help us with"**

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-04-15 02:42:00)

Her failure to deceive the one in charge only brings her more focus and determination, things that ultimately will distract her from the fear she had felt before. Taking the hand he offers, Jaya returns to her feet. After looking at her captor in the eyes her expression morphs from the frightened young girl that she was to the opportunistic young woman she is. **"Thank you, and yes, you are correct, I did lie. I'm simply a stowaway. He was as lax with his own security as he is with maintenance on this ship, he probably doesn't know that I'm on board."**
Jaya watches the crew operate with a keen interest, that is until the leader begins to propose something. His words catch her off guard, in response she shifts her attention to him and replies with quick offense. **"My people are skilled at everything, sir!"** She pauses, mouth agape, as she realizes what she has done. **"Apologies for my rudeness. Arrogance, along with engineering, is one of many things we are well renowned for. Whatever it is that I may assist with, I assure you that I would endeavor only to succeed at it. On a more personal note, I certainly would not turn down anything that might take me off this ship."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-20 16:01:54)

The avian looks at Jaya with an expressionless face, his thoughts impossible to read. He waves for her to follow him as he walks out of the cargo hold. As they passes through the corridors of the YT towards the docking ports, Jaya spots a few more of the armored soldies, but all in all the force that have boarded the ship seems very small.
**"The Duros is more crafty than you think. This vessel is armed with a pair of serially linked concussion missile launchers, well hidden. While we were able to overpower it pretty quickly, he managed to get a lucky hit, and blew our entire sensor array to pieces. We cannot restore full capacity without extensive repairs of external antennae and relays, but much can be done from the inside. This is where you come in"**
As the pass through the airlock, they enters into a small vessel of a design Jaya cannot identify.

---

### **Parmenter** (2011-04-25 11:33:49)

With the immediate threat of danger passing, Jaya was willing to see what her new acquaintances needed from her. As the apparent leader ushered her from the aging Corellian freighter, they passed through the airlock into the smaller ship that the assailants had used to neutralize the freighter. On the inside it was difficult for Jaya to determine the ships origin, perhaps with an exterior view she'd be more knowledgeable. ***Still,*** she thought, ***a lot of ship systems are not made by those who manufacture the ship, but by a third party dealer.*** Unless the sensor array is something alien, it should operate as any other and therefore be within her capabilities of operating on.
During the walk from one ship to another Jaya stayed silent. She merely used to time to observe and reflect upon what she saw. At their destination, the avian acknowledged the impaired system and gave her a moment to examine it.
((
Perception +9 (Trying to sense any danger she might be coming toward.)
Knowledge (Technology) +11 (Determining what is wrong, to better go about repairing it.)
))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-04-25 18:03:08)

As she walks into the ship that had boarded the YT, Jaya notices it to be a rather small vessel, and the force she saw boarding is most likely the extent of its crew. As she is lead up to the sensor array command station, she easily spots an obvious error.
Half the station is pretty broken up, with sparks and a still lingering trail of smoke coming out of the parts. The air also smells faintly burnt, and she guesses that the Duros must have scored a really lucky hit, and that the shockwave from the missile must have been enough to pass though the hull.
Upon a closer examination though, she finds that there are in fact much of the controls that are intact and functional, but as she runs some tests on the systems, all sorts of error messages comes up on the screen. As she takes a few moments to make a more thorough examination though - all the while with the avian being watching over her - she finds that most of the systems are still operating as if the external equipment they were calibrated for were still intact. It will require some reprogramming to fix, but most likely a couple pf manual overrides as well, as many systems are stand-alone designs, and nothing short of physical hotwiring will make them interact.

While her initial thoughts linger within her head, she begins pulling panels off the control station. Typing some basic commands leads to interesting results. Things on this end appear to be operational, yet they don't recognize their components on the outside.
Sticking her head into one of the panels she can see a vast array of wires and connections, some damaged by the attack, others seemingly fine. If she can figure out which systems are still working, she could conceivably reroute some of the damaged systems onto the good ones. It wouldn't be pretty or efficient, all of the systems would then be running at partial capacity.
Taking an inventory of the damaged connections, Jaya begins splicing wires together. With most things connected in some form, she returns to the controls and monitors. Typing away she searches the database for the electronic routes that she's established between the systems. Finally, she begins ushering commands that would allow the systems to share their infrastructure.

It isn´t pretty, and it isn´t by the book, but after some time of work Jaya manages to get the systems up and running. Running at greatly reduced capacity, sure, but still running. After all, you can´t do much with systems designed to utilize external antennae and sensor grids to amplify their capacity when those emplacements are no longer in place.
Moving forward to test some of the systems, the avian enters a few commands, trying various functions. Behind him, some of the soldiers starts to spill back into the ship, most likely done with moving the cargo from the YT-1300.
**"Looks like you got the job done. You have my thanks. However, since this craft has rather limited navigation capacities, you will have to return with us"**

**"Return with *us*, where? Nevermind, it sounds perfect. I didn't really know where I was going in the first place, so it's not like my plans are changed at all. May I ask though, there is food where we're going, right?"** Her excitement was palpable. But then that would be expected from someone who just found a way out of going to prison. Turning from the avian creature, she looks back toward the rest of the small ship, contemplating where she is going to sit. **"Is there someplace you'd prefer I sit? I can make-do with the floor if necessary."** Not really waiting for an answer, she wanders toward the back to look at spots. Satisfied with what she's found, she sits down next to one of the armored men. Turning to the suit of armor next to her she inquires. **"Is it far?"**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-18 16:35:39)

**"I am sure we can find something for you to eat once we arrive. In the meantime I only ask that you stay out of the way of my crew"**
Leaving the Arkanian to her own exploration, the avian moves towards the cockpit of the ship, leaving Jaya to look for herself. As she turns to one of the armored men, she notices very little response to her presence. As she inquires about their ETA, a speaker-produced voice tells her that the return trip would take about 3 hours.

***Three hours. Could be worse.*** She thought as she curled up on the chair. As the other people on board seemed indifferent to her presence and unwilling to interact with her, she felt it pertinent to catch up on a little more rest after her incident aboard the other transport. Her only remorse came from having left her effects aboard the other ship, but it was necessary, as going to find them would bring more holes to her, already shaky, story. Still, there was nothing there that she couldn't steal again.
Knees to her chest, she closes her eyes and rests.

Three hours passes quickly, and before she knows it, someone shakes Jaya awake and motions for her to get off the ship. As she leaves the ship, she is met with the bright light of a well-lit hangar bay. Blinking twice to adjust her eyes, she spots several craft that she can identify as Skipray Blastboats, an outdated ship model that she remembers saw production halt decades ago. Taking a look at the ship she had arrived on, she can´t recognize its design, nor can she recognize the emblem that is painted on its side. Looking around, she spots a massive force field separating the hangar bay from outer space, so chances were big they were aboard a larger ship of some sort.
Inside the hangar a few people armored like the ones she saw before - both the red body armor and the more simple versions the majority of the crew had worn - going about, and obviously preparing to unload the gains from the last raid. Sensing someone behind her, she turns around and finds the avian standing next to her.
**"Ah, I see you are awake. Welcome to our home. I realize we haven´t had time for proper introductions yet. I am known as Urai Fen, lord of the Zann Consortium"**

### **Parmenter** (2011-06-08 12:53:41)

Humbled by the Avian's self-proclaimed title, Jaya turns to face him completely. **"Jaya Treiden, acquisitor."** Unsure of how to greet him, she raises a hand in hopes that it is accepted. **"I had, until recently, worked with another group such as yourselves. Not as,"** she pauses searching for the correct word. "Professional, or talented, but they did make me feel at home."
Jaya looks up at the Lord, with a simple question in mind. **"Would the Consortium have need for someone of my talents? I have been trying to scratch out a living on my own for a short while now, and it would be exciting to work with others again."** She looks at him for a response, and while Jaya understands that a group like the Zann Consortium could have prime choice over who they admit into their collective, she hopes that she is considered on some level.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-05 17:13:13)

**"Acquisitor, huh? It just might be so that we could have some use for you"**
Urai Fen looks at Jaya, seemingly measuring her.
**"The Consortium is not what it once was. We lost much during the days of the New Republic, especially during the Vong war. But now, with Krayt´s Empire running the scene, things are looking brighter for groups like ours. As long as we don´t mess with the wrong people of course"**
A smile crept into the avians features, as if he somehow didn´t mind at all messing with Krayt´s Empire. Or perhaps he was remembering something from the past.
**"Anyway, in order to rebuild our organization fully, we need to rearm. The supplies we got from your Duros friend, and several similar raids will go a long way towards keeping our fleet in shape, but we need new hardware as well. and this is where you might be able to help us"**

## First things first.

### **Parmenter** (2011-07-12 02:10:07)

Before Jaya could respond to Fen's comments on where she would be useful, her stomach gave an audible growl. **"You had mentioned food before we left the Duro's ship. Is that still an option?"** Apart from being hungry, this would also be a good chance for her to study her new surroundings. Learn about the inner structure of what could be her new family. There were bound to be strained relationships here that she should to be aware of, or exploit should the situation arise.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-07-18 09:23:49)

Urai Fen smiles and snaps his fingers at one of the mercenaries working in the hangar, making a quick gesture. The mercenary halts his work for a moment, digging through his pockets and fishes up a small package that he throws to Fen. The Avian throws the package at Jaya.
**"There. Some might not call it food, but it´ll keep you alive"**
