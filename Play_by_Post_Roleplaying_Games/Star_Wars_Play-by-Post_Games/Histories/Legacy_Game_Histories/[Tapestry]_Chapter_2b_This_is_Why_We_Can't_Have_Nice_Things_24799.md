# [Tapestry] Chapter 2b: This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things

### **Anazider** (2010-09-11 23:08:56)

A blaster bolt sizzles by overhead, just missing the bobbing droid assistant as he hovers around his master. The master, a mottled skin young humanoid wearing a frayed and singed labcoat, straddles one of the rear engine nacelles on the massive Nemesis-class patrol boat, staring at a gaping blaster wound in the hull.
**"Master, if you please- ahh!"** One of Jasper's whipcord appendages reaches out and pulls Callia to the side, the droid just narrowly managing to keep the mad Fyrthen from becoming perforated. There have been a multitude of these near-misses, and as the numbers increase in the scrum taking place below the No Chance, so do the frequency of the stray blaster bolts.
**"Oh please master, come back inside the ship! It is not safe here!"**Callia continues with his contemplative staring at the blaster scarring. Something in the incongruent rending of the ship's hull, vexes the mad scientist fiercely, and as he sits with his plasma welder in hand, the battle going on just beneath his feet could all but be light years away.
On the floor of the docking bay, a massive Mandalorian wields an equally massive powerhammer against an incoming tide of imperial stormtroopers and naval troops. A dozen bodies already lay scattered around the docking facility, and Al'verde seems intent on adding to the score as wave after wave of Imperials floods through the massive hole blown in the bay's blast doors.
For every stormtrooper that the Mandalorian bats aside, two come to take there place, and it is not long before the the armored warrior is surrounded on all sides, and doing everything he can to keep them at bay, while fending the troopers away from the *No Chance*.
**"By mandate of Governor Radge Rothke and the will of his highness Emperor Krayt, you are hereby under arrest, and ordered to submit yourself for questioning!"**
*******************************************************************************
Dingy, dimly lit, and filled with an ever-present haze of smoke, the *Power Surge* is a buzz with activity, although an overwhelming majority of it is off-duty Imperials as several patrols appear to be in the middle of a shift change. Scattered throughout the clusters of tables are pockets of spacers and offworld riff-raff, while fewer still are the number of Hobben who count mostly among the cantina's wait staff and cleaning crew.
The conversations run the gamut from bitter mutterings to raucous banter between comrades, and it is apparent that more than a few shady dealings are in the offing. In one cramped booth, a tall, willowy young woman sits opposite another figure, both of them shrouded in hooded cloaks and speaking in hushed tones. At infrequent intervals, the Hobben waitresses come by the table and clear away dishes, or inquire as to further orders, but a practiced observer would be able to spy the subtle look-out and informant operation for what it was.
**"There is some news on your missing clan, but you will not like all of it…"**
As the willowy young woman turns her head slightly to regard the speaker, a shock of white hair can be glimpsed, and as a hand strays to pat the unruly lock of hair back into place, the appearance of only four digits marks the woman as Arkanian...
*******************************************************************************
Off in another dimly-lit corner, sits a Kel Dor all to himself. The man is dressed in clothing all of drabs and greys, and he sits nursing a small meal and a smaller drink. Most of the other patrons give the Kel Dor a wide berth, and the very few that would dare to invite themselves to the hunter's company are soon warded off by his unsettling gaze.
Although soon it becomes apparent that all are not warded off, as a single Imperial army officer sorts himself from the crowd and comes over to stand before Daz's table. Without waiting for the Kel Dor to invite the man to sit, the officer pulls out a chair opposite of Daz and slides into it neatly, meeting the hunter's stare with an even nod.
**"Daz Sult, presume? I am Captain Ordenes, and I am the liaison for mercenary hires on this backwater. I just wanted to see what kind of man I'd be dealing with before I go handing over the briefing; seems all I've gotten recently are idiots and psychotics, and neither one tends to last very long out in the jungle."**

JS-PR is used to his master dismissing and even ignoring the droid's concerns, but never before has he experienced the Fyrthen so flagrantly ignoring his own safety.
Callia seems entirely unresponsive to the battle going on below, even when stray fire splashes on the *No Chance*'s hull. He simply repairs the damage as it occurs, wielding his welder with exceptional speed and expertise.
Yet it is beginning to irritate him, and underneath the concealment of the young scientist's goggles one eye has begun to twitch.
'Master!' Jasper yells once more, twining his manipulative cords around Callia and pulling him back just in time to evade another shrieking energy bolt that fizzles out on the ship's plating, leaving a bubbling rend.
'Broken spanners and twisted bolts!' Callia snaps, 'how do they expect me to work in these conditions? Thoughtless, imbecilic, bantha-brained cretins! Jasper!'
'Yes Master?' the floating protocol droid replies hopefully.
If he is expecting the lad to do something rational like go to safety, he is to be disappointed:
'Have the twins do something about all this will you?' Callia states, waving his hand in a way that demonstrates he has now delegated the problem and expects it to go away.
Droids have no need nor biological imperative to sigh, and yet Jasper does so as he activates his internal comlink and holds a rapid binary exchange with the two custom-built battle droids that comprise his maker's security team.
Meanwhile, Callia hums under his breath as he gets to work repairing the latest damage.

People read all sorts of promises in Daz's quiet stare, from rebuke to apathy or even threats of physical violence. The importance of eye contact in judgment of demeanor and stability is not something he could really be subject to, and as such the majority of the galactic populace had been determined to err on the side of caution. If solitude through intimidation happened to be the passive outcome of his own behavior, he would consider himself glad for it in light of the possible alternatives. Waiting only took longer when it was a group activity.
Daz Sult does not nod in return or feel the need to make a movement of any kind as he listens to the Captain. **"I understand, Captain,"** the vocorder in his breathing mask drones, though in truth he is not entirely sure he does. The reasoning in support of such people being fit for this kind of work completely eluded him, so why it had not been a given in the first place was a mystery. On the other hand, if he had provided the anecdote for Daz's benefit than he was concerned about the estimation of his abilities. For his own sake, he hoped his liaison was simply making a joke to broach a mutually consensual opinion in order to put himself at ease.
He carefully lifts his procured sustenance and sets it down a few inches to the side as to not obstruct the tables surface between him and the Captain. Refocusing his attention on the man across from him, he considers how concise he will be able to be while still having himself be clear. **"I would like specifics, please."** Being polite generally did not do any harm, though being misunderstood even in that regard was not an unheard of occurrence for the Kel Dor.

Of the places she'd been on this planet, the *Power Surge* would not rank as one of her favorites, as the high concentration of Imperial officers made her uncomfortable. However, it was a veritable hub of information that Jaya can not afford ignore. She has been looking for remnants of her family for near six months, and has had no success as of yet. Recently she'd been made aware of the information network branching out from this establishment, and with few other leads she entered the den looking for answers.
Two weeks ago she had made first contact with the woman she now was waiting to hear from. She had, unprofessionally asked her questions, and left. This time, at the behest of her contact, she sits down for an inconspicuous meal before being joined by the informant. While waiting she poked at what food remained on her dish. The shrouded Hobben uses the young Arkanian's heedless state to sit down without her noticing. As a waitress comes by to check on the new person at her table, they converse in what Jaya believes to be a code. With the servers departure, the Hobben speaks. **"There is some news on your missing clan, but you will not like all of it…"** Jaya stares intently at the speaker and interrupts, **"As long as any of it is good. I'll have it."**

### **Anazider** (2010-09-19 16:07:25)

Al'verde swings his Powerhammer horizontally, the side-swip catchin a Naval trooper full in the chest and sending him soaring across the hangar while with his other hand the Mandalorian grabs hold of a stormtrooper and bodily hurls the soldier into an oncoming group of his fellows. This leaves the *vod* wide-open and slightly off balance, allowing a pair of stormtroopers to rush in for an tackle, pushing the Mandalorian back several steps.
But the massive warrior plants his weight and halts the Bantha Rush, his incredible strength enough to stop both troopers cold. A blaster bolt glances off of his armored shoulder, but Al'verde ignores the pain as he brings a heavy, armored fist down on the helmeted-skulls of the two Stormtroopers, knocking them soundly unconscious. The Mandalorian now stands near the base of the No Chance's boarding ramp, his ammunition expended and his Powerhammer feeling heavy in his hands, while over a dozen Imperials stand between him and the hangar bay doors with more filtering in by the moment.
*Clank-clank-clank-clank-**clunk**…*
Behind him, Al'verde hears the clacking march of twin droids moving in perfect lock-step before they halt at the top of the patrol boat's loading ramp. Suddenly, a deluge of red death launches from over the Mandalorian's shoulder, mowing down the mass of Imperials wherever they stand. The hail of blaster fire is enough to match the torrential rains pouring down on top of the Starport's dome, and when the droid's have completed their emotionless work, nearly two dozen blaster-scorched bodies join the incredible pile that Al'verde had already created.
**"Threats eliminated, perimeter secure- "
"-Engaging point-defense mode."**
Alpha and Beta speak in perfect coordination, and as they do Al'verde starts scavenging amongst the bodies for power packs and grenades. The Mandalorian calls back over his shoulder and up to the mad scientist as he picks up a pair of power packs and locks them into his blaster cannon.
**"They're going to keep comin' unless we do something about the hole in the door! Probably bring something a lot bigger than these idiots too, can you do anything?"**
*******************************************************************************
**"We had word of several escape pods being sighted not far from the city, but by the time we were able to coordinate an investigation, the Imperials had already secured them and their passengers. They were last seen under guard at a remote outpost, and scheduled for transfer to the garrison."**
The shadowy Hobben across from Jaya makes the pretense of ordering another drink, but as she does she takes a hidden datapad from their waitress so quickly that the Arkanian almost missed it even though she has so close a view.
**"There was a rescue effort in the planning, but something has had the Imperial moss-suckers, "** strong invective indeed, in the Hobben tongue, **"On high alert. We've reports of more and more of my people being pressed into slavery then ever- "**
**"By mandate of Governor Radge Rothke and the will of his highness Emperor Krayt, you are hereby under arrest!"**
All conversation in the cantina stops as a new squad of stormtroopers emerges through the Surge's front doors, a brazen young officer at their head. All heads turn to the newcomers and his proclamation, and many of the spacers in the cantina try to edge out of their seats and towards an available exit with varying degrees of success. With his error dawning on him slowly, the young officer clears his throat in an attempt to hide his embarrassment and then strides more fully into common room, pointing at all of the Hobben.
**"All Hobben are immediately to be taken into custody, and all non-Imperial personnel are to be detained until further notice. Now come along quietly, offer no resistance, and we will have this bit of business straightened out in short order!"**
The officer stands preening with his hands on his hips, this likely being his first command and he obviously doesn't expect any dissent. No one immediately makes a move, and seeing this the Imperial raises a finger to issue further orders, but at that same moment a filthy dish rag completes its arc through the air to wrap tightly around the officer's face with a wet plop.
All the onlookers watched as the dish rag fluttered through the air, although if any knew who threw, none stepped forward. Judging by the intense aroma that wafted from the dish rag during its flight, the wet-eared Imperial was going to be smelling something rancid for quite some time. As the officer wrestles the rag from his face, he pulls his sidearm from its holster and fires it once into the air, curtailing any further snickering.
**"Seize this rabble, and shoot anyone that disagrees!"**
*******************************************************************************
Captain Ordenes slides a datapad across the table to Daz, the small screen revealing a series of maps and overlays. The Imperial then leans back in his chair with his hands folded across his stomach.
**"There's a valley we want explored. Seems it's some kind of 'holy' place to the savages,"** The Captain's grunt shows just want he thinks of that, **"And the Sith Lords are chomping at the bit to get at it. Thing is, two recon squads that've gone in have been demolished by the local wild life, only got three survivors out of twenty. Can't get anything from an aerial visual scan, so that's where you come in."**
Ordenes snatches up his drink from the table, taking long draft from the strong liquor before he continues.
**"Get me some good layout scans, find me an egress point where I can drop an expeditionary force and you'll be compensated well. Find any sign of what's making the higher ups all jumpy and I'll throw in a nice bonus. Questions?"**
The captain takes another sip of his liquor, but before Daz can respond both hear the decree and watch the proceedings ending with the young Officer's final order. A pair of stormtroopers tromps over to the table, blaster rifles drawn, and they both look to the Kel-Dor expectantly.
Tossing back the last bit of liquor in his glass, Captain Ordenes has little else to offer Daz other than an apologetic shrug.

Callia smiles to himself as he listens to the screaming blaster barrage worsen in intensity and then fall silent. Yet another problem, yes, life seems so full of them. But like all problems a solution is forthcoming to the well-organised mind.
Jasper bobs over to the edge of the ship and over, dropping down to survey the carnage.
'You shouldn't look, Master,' he recommends, 'you know how you get when you see a messy work space.'
'Ahhhhh, thank you Jasper,' Callia replies as he finishes up the last of his repair work.
'Well done boys,' he adds absently, message relayed to the twin security droids by way of his hands-free comlink.
Al'verde calls up to him, and Callia looks around to see what the Mandalorian is talking about. Jasper, it seems, is making his own analysis.
'What can the Master do? That hole is huge!'
'Hmmmmm,' the Fyrthen muses to himself, brain already engaging with the new challenge.
He is no tactician but knows a logical course of action when he sees it. Within seconds, the little scientist has a plan.
'Twins,' he comms on the private channel shared with all three droids, 'search the bay for objects suitable for a barricade. Block off as much of the hole's width as you can before building upward. Make hostile entry as difficult as possible. Max speed.'
The battle droids rush to do his bidding, the wheels on their feet flipping out and locking in place so they can move at their fastest across the flat docking bay floor.
'Jasper,' continues the scientist in what is probably his most lucid moment of conversation since his unusual introduction to the motley impromptu crew of the *No Chance*, 'there will be a terminal. Access it, you're going to act as a remote link and provide my back door to local systems.'
He speaks louder now, for the benefit of the warrior below. His speech is so much less vague, so much more assured than it is during normal social interaction (what little there is with him), perhaps because his mind is seeing the whole scenario as a puzzle to solve.
'Hey! If there's any exterior security to activate, any additional barriers to lock down, I'll make it happen. But I can't just fix a gaping hole like that without an hour or two to do the task! Make yourself useful and work on getting the ship flight ready while I'm busy, even if we can't jump to hyperspace we can do more than just sit here. We *have* to if you want out! And don't touch the refresher unit, I only just fixed it!'
((OOC: Yeah, twins starting work on a barricade and will continue to do so while things are quiet. Jasper moves to jack into the nearest terminal, and Callia is readied to start hacking the moment his PR droid performs that action.))

Daz Sult is pleased by the routine and fiscally rewarding task he is presented with, and was in the midst of letting this be known to his would-be employer as well when an act of bravado demanded the attention of all the inhabitants in order to inform them of their imminent arrest.
Living on an Imperial-controlled world, this was not an unsettling or unheard of occurrence for Daz. There were a myriad of times he had been personally placed in the same situation with varying results. The one constant, however, was that the most prudent course of action for him was never inherently apparent, and relied heavily on the people around him.
The Captain's noncommittal shrug comes at no surprise to the Kel Dor as he levels his gaze at the Stormtroopers apparently intent on guaranteeing that he would be cooperative. Raising his hands slowly, in what he had always assumed was a fairly standard act of adherence, he considered a few things. The first of which was that his rifle was secured in a case located inside of a locker along with some other equipment, as he had apparently under-estimated his need for them. This meant that, aside from the survival knife inside his pack resting next to his foot under the table, he was completely unarmed unless he could get his hands on any weapon the Captain may have. He was also concerned about how engaging in a conflict between the local populace and Imperial Authorities would reflect on his immediate job prospects, as the dirty cloth made a shoot-out fairly inevitable from where he was sitting.
((OOC: Content to offer no resistance until the shooting starts, at which point Daz will tip the table over towards the Stormtrooper (provided it is not bolted to the floor, in which case simply duck under it), and try to grab the Captain's sidearm if he happened to have one holstered in plausible reach, otherwise he'll begin fishing through his pack for the knife.))

The sounds of the bar seem to fade from Jaya's ears as she listens to the informant with rapt attention. Hints of her family's state of being is the best news she's heard in the past couple months. As her Hobben associate continues talking, a datapad enters her view for a moment, she glances to her side to see where it has come from, only to see their waitress passing by. As Jaya's contact continues to elaborate on the situation the environment of the *Power Surge* is disrupted by an entering officer announcing his intentions.
Jaya freezes with fear as the establishment fills up with troopers. She can't let herself be taken, though part of her wishes it. Instead, she uses the distraction of the washcloth to cower to the floor and begin moving toward the kitchen. Surely there was an exit there, or if nothing else something that she could use to make an exit.

**"When the distraction begins, escape as quickly as you can. Go to the four-armed junk-peddler, he has been a friend to us in these dark times…"**
Although the Hobben informant hides it well, Jaya can catch the tell-tale gleam of a hold-out blaster pistol being drawn from a concealed holster. The Arkanian can tell that the blaster is borderline-archaic by current standards, but it seems well-maintained, and a blaster bolt fired from an ancient emitter can be just as lethal as one fired from a brand new one.
**"Go! Run now!"**
The order comes out in a harsh whisper through clenched teeth, and as the Hobben woman instructs Jaya she simultaneously flips the table over and draws her blaster in full. The first shot catches a stormtrooper, and everyone else in the cantina, by surprise, but it is immediately followed by chaos as a handful of other Hobben around the bar draw their own concealed blasters, and even a few of the seated spacers. Most of the others attempt a sprint for the exits, while the stormtroopers attempt to blockade and subdue all.
*******************************************************************************
The set of stormtroopers in front of Daz turn at the sound of blaster fire, and most of them are drawn back into the common room of the cantina, to handle the growing mob there. That leaves just two stormtroopers in front of the Kel-Dor hunter, and the Captain, but Ordenes seems more concerned with moving to establish order in the bar rather than with the mercenary in front of him.
He stands and rushes back towards the fray, shouting orders and drawing his officer's sidearm as he goes. This leaves Daz to his own devices, with the two stormtroopers drawing closer to place the hunter under detainment.
*******************************************************************************
**"Order acknowledged!"
"Order acknwoledged!"**
The Twins harmonize in their robotic cant, and as they clank their way down the No Chance's boarding ramp, their blaster rifles disassemble and retract beneath armored plates on their robotic forearms. Tireless workers, the two droids begin to stack crates, boxes, and even bits of debris in front of the blasted hangar-bay door, while Al'verde stands watching guard with his Powerhammer slung over a shoulder. When Callia addresses him, the massive Mandalorian grunts to himself and then shrugs before swaggering up the boarding ramp and into the patrol boat's confines. Once there, Al'verde begins to put his own technical expertise to the task.
Jasper releases the droid equivalent of a long-suffering sigh, but nonetheless he bobs over to the nearest access terminal. One of his whip-like appendages twists slightly, transforming into a comm access probe and without preamble the spherical droid jams the probe into the comm port, a series of lights and figures streaming by on his head-up display as he begins to decipher the spaceports encryption.
**"Access established master, and I have begun the preliminary firewall penetration sub-routine. I am ready to proceed at your leisure."**

'Good,' Callia replies as his fingers fly across his data-bracer, 'then help me out. Relay the systems output back to me. Correct any mistakes in my coding before you pass it back into the system. We're looking for any security doors around the hangar perimeter we can close, any security systems we can turn against our enemies. If we can buy enough time I can work out a way to make a more permanent barricade. and get this ship flight-ready.'
With Jasper acting as a remote link by which his powerful computer can access the port's systems, the young scientist begins his hack.
((OOC: I'll obviously be attempting to Improve Access (page 76 SECR); here's hoping the starport's network allows public access so it only starts out as Indifferent! Jasper will cooperate which should result in another +2 (hope he doesn't roll a 1!) leaving Callia's final modifier at +14 - +10 +2 from goggles +2 from Jasper))

As the immediate combatants he would be challenged with significantly decrease, and the shootout in the common room only just getting started, Daz Sult considers the cost of his inevitable victory over the two Stormtroopers. He then weighs that against the ease by which he could simply grab his back and move as quickly as possible to the back in hopes of evading imminent arrest or other forms of prosecution derived from aggravation from the unfolding events before him. How unfortunate it was that he was quite easy to identify on this planet, but complications arising from that would be crossed when they could take the forefront of present issues.
Moving his hands slowly down onto the table as he initially feigns standing in compliance with the Stormtroopers, he quickly grabs the edge and flips it over towards them as an act to give him the moment he needs to grab his pack from the floor next to his feet and *make a break for it* with all manner of expedience. Perhaps he would go out of his way to inquire about the stability of the next planet he was visiting.

Her hobben contact put into words exactly what Jaya was thinking. Fleeing was her only option, and at her size she should be relatively unnoticed heading out of the room. Her only regret being that she had little to offer the hobben in return for this favor. With haste Jaya ducks to the ground and makes for an exit. She keeps an eye on her surroundings for a way to help her friends and an ear on the battle in case her flight is noticed by the Imperials.
