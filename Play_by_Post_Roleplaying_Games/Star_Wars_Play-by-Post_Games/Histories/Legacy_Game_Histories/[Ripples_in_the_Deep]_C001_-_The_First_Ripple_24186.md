# [Ripples in the Deep] C001 - The First Ripple

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-12 21:35:18)

The transport *Sunbug* drops low as its engines stutter again, and only the skill of its Nagaian pilot Kaito prevents the YT-2400 from dropping out of the sky onto the jagged mountaintops of Salcu below.
With a slight crackle of static the comm channel opens up.
'*Sunbug*, this is Salcuan Flight Control. You have gone off course. Transmitting corrected flight path to landing coordinates now. Failure to follow them willâ€”â€˜
â€˜Negative Control, we have an engine malfunction. Weâ€™ll be lucky to land in one piece!â€™
â€˜Understood, *Sunbug*. Make an emergency landing and weâ€™ll send out assistance as soon as possible.â€™
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tâ€™iallo and Elashi stalk through the long golden grass, engaging in an elaborate exercise of predator and prey. Either one could be the predator, of course, depending on who successfully gets the drop on whom. Both the Firrerreoan and the Cathar are disguised well against the grass, their natural colouration helping them blend in. Relying on their eyes will not help either of themâ€”which is appropriate, since Jedi training is never about honing the senses alone.
The Master pauses in his movement, spreading out his Jedi senses across the plains. There is his apprentice, not far behind him, but suddenly she is the least of his concerns. There is a mass of life, like a wall. Far off yet, butâ€¦
The earth beneath his feet seems less stable, somehow.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Corellian freighter dips even lower, engines flickering on and off weakly.
Qurâ€™aiden checks a screen of diagnostic readings, understanding in his mind the symbols that his eyes are incapable of seeing.
â€˜Thereâ€™s no hope of repairing these engines if we keep pushing them. Theyâ€™ll die. And after that, so will we! We have to land, and fast.â€™
His wookiee master Orllovrllel roars his agreement.
Their sentiment is shared by all the other Jedi in the ship. The Codru-ji Master Ketanna folds all four arms and nods grimly. Her apprentice Talak nods too.
â€˜You can do it, Master,â€™ the Mon Calamarian Gunsan says, voice full of confidence. He still tightens the buckles of his seatâ€™s crash webbing though.
Kaito smiles grimly.
â€˜Iâ€™ll make it as smooth as I can,â€™ he says. â€˜So itâ€™s now or never? Then hold on, here we go.â€™
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
â€˜Master, whatâ€™s happening?â€™, Elashi asks. She has sensed it too now, and both of them have come to an unspoken understanding that the stalking game is over.
Taking a break, they snack on unappetising rations and swig from fresh canteens of water, talking between mouthfuls.
'There's only one thing it could be,' T'iallo replies, evidently concerned. He looks directly at his apprentice.
'Sluuvath.'
'But we're not in the Band!'
T'iallo nods grimly.
'And we'reâ€”
He nods again. There's no reason for the Cathar to finish speaking. They both know full well that they hiked to the spot and have no means of escaping before the Sluuvath are upon them.
Elashi's ears prick up as they register a low hum, increasing in volume as though getting closer fast.
'There's a ship coming!'
Both of them look up in time to see an old YT-2400 soaring toward them from the direction of the mountains. It dips and rocks, obviously having some manner of engine trouble and likely coming in for a crash landing.
The ship seems familiar to T'iallo. In fact, more than familiar. It looks identical to one he's seen before. One that brought only pain, misery and anger into his life. He somehow feels light-headed, emotions welling within him in spite of his calming techniques. It feels freeing somehow.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Miraculously the engines hold out just long enough during the emergency landing procedure, allowing Kaito to land the *Sunbug* right-way up and with its landing gear fully extended from the undercarriage. It could take off again at any time. Provided the engines are repaired, of course.
Thrown around by the landing, the Errant Knights within are otherwise unharmed. A little sore perhaps, but the crash webbing and their Force powers have kept them from real harm.
From his seat at the front of the cockpit, Kaito is first to look out of the viewport. The ship sits within a sea of long golden grass that waves back and forth, even far from the *Sunbug*. Too far to have been affected by their landing. There must be a breeze outside.

**"Stay low in the grass and we'll approach from down wind. From here on, speak only with your thoughts until I determine otherwise. Let us go *greet* our unexpected guests… Before the Sluuvath do."**
T'iallo words come out in a growling near whisper, his words carrying an undertone that promises no small amount of menace for the occupants of the Corellian freighter. He takes one last glance at their campsite, spying the elongated haft of his lightsaber and then summoning it to his hand. With one last nod for Elashi, the Firrerreoan silently stalks into the tall grass, quickly disappearing from view.
***Apparently the poachers didn't learn their lesson last time. I'll have to be sure to teach more carefully.*** He kept the thought to himself. With each passing moment, the Errant Knight's pace quickened until he was loping through the grass, every bit the predator. A stray care for the campsite they were leaving behind flitted across the surface of his thoughts, but he discarded it. T'iallo's focus was solely on the crash-landed freighter.
Somewhere at the back of his mind, it occurs to him that the freighter may be full of wayward travelers. Their ragged flight path and jarring landing hinted at some sort of mechanical malfunction. But with each step he takes deeper into the wild grass, the already niggling thought grows quieter. A simmering pride and fury grows to take its place, and with it a sense of freedom. Of righteousness.
***Have to keep them safe. Elashi,* di'apa, *everyone. Whoever they are, they're about to regret having come here.***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**"I regret having met any of you bastards!"**
Qur'aiden wails mightily as he struggles against the confines of his crash webbing, and a rather massively-furry arm draped across his face. He finally wrestles the clasp of the harness free, and wriggles from beneath his master's arm, quickly jumping to his feat and wagging an accusatory finger at everyone nearby.
**"I told you the karkin' power couplings were poodoo, but Oooh Noooo, everybody was all 'we can make one more jump' and 'you worry too much', well look at us now! And guess who's gonna have to fix it all, huh? Me, and not one damn one of ya, that's who!"**
The scrawny teen continues to rant loudly as he storms from one end of the decrepit freighter to the other. Finally he comes to the cockpit and levels his mighty finger at master Kaito.
**"And you *suck* at flying! My Neby better be O- Neby!"**
Without out another word, the miralukan is off sprinting wildly through the YT-2400's corridors. He hops over railings and slides down stairs until at long last he's in the cargo bay, and before his beloved Swoop Bike.

The *Nebula Blazer* is as fine as it has a right to be, given the volatile conditions it has just been through. Qur'aiden has been smart enough to secure the vehicle within the cargo bay, guaranteeing it not to be thrown around.
The same is not true of *everything* in the cargo bay, however. Several stray boxes and barrels have been tossed back and forth during flight and it seems they've hit his speeder and caused a number of pangs and scratches. The damage is purely cosmetic, but it appalls the Miralukan to see his precious baby hurt.

### **Alicia** (2009-06-29 08:36:27)

Elashi nodded as she summoned her own lightsaber to her hand and clipped it to her belt. As they began to stalk toward the crashed ship she couldnâ€™t help a small giggle as she looked at Tâ€™iallo, an image of the crag lions flittering to the forefront of her thoughts as they disappeared into the grass. Tâ€™iallo seemed to have an affinity with the animals he defended with fervor from poachers and it showed in how he conducted his life. Especially in how he hunted as all he needed was a pack.
***Have to keep them safe. Elashi, di'apa, everyone. Whoever they are, they're about to regret having come here.*** She heard him say to her through their link. Speaking telepathically was an easy feat as far as she was concerned, though it had taken these last two years for her to open up completely to her Firrerreoan master.
***Weâ€™re all going to regret being here if we donâ€™t get away before the Sluuvath arrive. Why do you think theyâ€™ve all of a sudden changed their pattern?***  The last stray thought left her feeling nervous. Who knew what long term changes their sudden migration divergence would cause for the citizens of Sulca. She had only lived here for barely two years now and until then had only heard reports of the destruction they could cause.
As they neared the freighter she diverged to come in from a different angle, pulling her lightsaber from her belt. Its weight in her hand a comforting reminder of the training she had underwent these last two years. She would hide in the tall grass until Tâ€™iallo said otherwise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ketanna hesitantly began untangling herself from the crash webbing. With a small laugh she stood and stretched before making sure the others around her were unharmed. She heard the Miralukan apprentices complaints on the landing, if it could be called that. *They say any landing you can walk away from is a good one.* A smile perked the corners of her mouth as the young man floundered around, finally leaving everyone be to check on the bike stored away in the cargo bay.
â€œ**Your apprentice is quite exuberant.**â€ She said to the Wookiee master as she helped Talak out of the restraints. Two arms working to unfasten them while her lower two remained hidden under her cloak. Knowing any response Orllovrllel gave her wouldnâ€™t be understood didnâ€™t prevent her from speaking to him. She just hoped someone would be able to translate. Unfortunately the one who had been left to check on his precious property.
"**Is everyone alright?**" Ketanna asked the group, reassured now that she and her new student, Talak, were relatively unharmed. With her growing healing ability she was certain she could take care of the minor wounds earned on their â€œlandingâ€,

As his apprentice crawls out from under his arm, Orllo straightens up and calmly releases his crash webbing, letting it snap back into place. As his apprentice began protesting yet again, Orllo let him rant. There was a time and place for everything in the universe, and now was a good a time for a rant as any.
He stand up, stretching his long limbs, and thankful to be out of the cramped seats that had really not been designed for someone of his great height. As he stretches, Ketanna speaks to him. â€œYour apprentice is quite exuberant.â€ He growls his assent, hoping she would at least understand that much.
He follows after Qur'Aiden, straight to the docking bay which was littered with a few barrels and boxes that had been tossed about in their rough landing. He stands a barrel back up on end as he approaches his apprentice and his beloved bike. <Do not let your attachment to this speeder bike grow out of hand, young one. You must seek balance in your emotions or the dark side will overcome you as it has many in the past. The Nebula Blazer is only an object but it is connected to the Force, as everything is. It can breed the dark side as easily as anything else.> He drags a finger along a particularly long scratch. <This scratch is superficial and matters not to the function of the machine. It is what is inside it that matters most--the spark that allows it to run. Remember that and do not be concerned for it.>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gunsan is tossed about roughly in the landing but he protects himself in the Force, in ways Master Kot had taught him several years ago. Once his new master, Kaito, had settled the ship down amongst the golden grain, Gunsan unstrapped himself and approached him.
"I told you that you could do it, Master," he says with a smile. He had learned in his years as a spacer that the young often did better with words of encouragement, though he had never expected to use such on his own master.
The Force had dealt him a curious hand with a master several years younger than himself. He had respected the elder Master Kot immensely, in part because of the wisdom he had gained with age. Kaito did not have that age, though he had showed some of that wisdom in the six weeks they'd been together. He is learning to respect the younger man, though Kaito does make it easy--he had earned the title of master fairly.
That did not make it any less awkward to refer to the younger man as Master, though, which was why he found himself ofter referring to Kaito as such, in hopes that it would become less awkward with time. "What is our next move, Master?"

### **Valheru** (2009-06-29 18:15:53)

Kaito ignores the miralukan boys complaints, focusing instead on the ship and its crew. He glances first at his new apprentice. Their age difference could create unusual difficulties in their relationship, but then again if it were easy he might get bored with it. Uncertain if Gunsan meant his comment as encouragement or just an expression of confidence, Kaito decides to respond with his unusual humor. "**Yes, it could have been a lot worse,**" he says with a wry smile.
Looking back at the others Kaito is relieved to see they are alright. He nods to Ketanna, "**We're fine. We won't be going anywhere in this ship for awhile though.**"
Kaito turns back to the controls to begin a post-flight check. His eyes scan various readouts and thankfully it appears everything is normal save the engines. "**Well, why don't you go see what you can do with the engines? I'll join you shortly**," he says in response to Gunsan's question.
"**Control, this is Sunbug. We're in one piece but the engines are slagged. We'll attempt repairs and keep you updated on our status.**" With that he unbuckles his crash webbing and awaits their response.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Talak has always hated flying and this landing hasn't improved his opinion of it. Using a Jedi calming technique he sooths his rebelling stomach and collects himself. Now that they've landed Talak wants these blasted restraints off and discovers Ketanna has already begun removing them. Unsure whether to be grateful or annoyed he finishes the task without comment, then stands up to stretch.
"**Master, would it be alright if I went outside? I'd like to get back on solid ground.**"

Kaito waits only mere moments before the female voice of Control responds to his statement.
'We hear you, *Sunbug*. Can you give precise coordinates to your location?'
It doesn't take the ship's computer long to reference the flight paths and coordinate lists that had been provided upon their entry into Salcuan space. The Errant Master quickly verifies their position.
'Could you repeat those coordinates, *Sunbug*?'
He does so.
Control goes silent for several long seconds.
Then, finally:
'I'm so sorry, *Sunbug*, but you're on your own.'

It doesn't take T'iallo long to happen upon the small clearing where the YT-2400 lands. His steps slow and become more precise, and his breathing becomes measured as he prowls ever closer to the transport. Every one of the Firrerreoans senses are heightened, as adrenaline and something much darker courses through him.
Circling around the light freighter, the Errant Knight catches sight of what he seeks: The *Sunbug's* boarding ramp. A perfectly feral smile spreads across his lips as he charges the vessel, his yellow-bladed lightsaber igniting just before he swings a pair of vicious, criss-crossing swings at the boarding ramp, cutting sizzling furrows into the hatch. He continues slashing and chopping, his rage lending him a terrible strength.
In the tall grass, Elashi feels that something very *wrong* is happening to her master, and the pure rage coming from him through their bond is nearly stifling. Where before she had always felt T'iallo channel his rage, now it is as if he were reveling in it, and slowly he is being washed away.
**(Standard Action: Attack YT-2400 Boarding Ramp +5 for 2d10+29 *9 pts of power attack)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden affects his best incredulous squint at his Master, his blindfold creasing. He returns to alternating between buffing and kissing the swoop bike, although as Orllovrllel speaks, his buffing becomes more purposeful and much less frantic.
**"Yeah, yeah, I know big guy, I know. But the Nebula Blazer is the one thing I've got that's mine and ain't nobody took. She's got my nerfcakes out the Sarlacc more times than I can count."**
With one last buff, the Miralukan pats the saddle of the speederbike and quickly rises to his feet. He watches his Master go about setting the cargo back aright, and after a *very* fleeting feeling of guilt, he moves to help.
**"Don't see why *we're* the ones pickin' up! Should make that pale space-slug what crashed this heap do it!"**

With a startled cry, Elashi covers her ears as if the act itself would block out the unbridled fury coming from T'iallo. Desperate to maintain her own sanity she fights to block the emotions coming to her through the link. ***Master… Master, please stop…*** she pleads through the link, grasping at any shred of the kindness left remaining in him so he would come to his senses.
Never before had she seen such rage in him. At times she knew he allowed his anger to get the better of him, but never like this. *I have to stop him*. Taking a stumbling step forward, Elashi leaves her cover in the tall grass and makes her way toward the ship where T'allo is cutting his way in. With each step, she continues to fight against the Firrerreoan master's rage. She calls on the Force to quicken her steps in an attempt to reach her master before it's too late.
(( Surge Use the Force +14 ))
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Ketanna nods to Talak.giving her permission with the slight motion. Sensing his unease over being in the starship she knows it would probably be best if he had some time to collect his thoughts where it would come more naturally to him." **Just don't wander off too far.**" As Talak walks away she enters the cockpit to speak to Kaito. **"Any word as to when help will be arriving?**" Ketanna leans against the bulkhead her two visable arms crossing in front of her.

### **Valheru** (2009-06-30 02:27:12)

Kaito's brow furrows in surprise in the sudden change of attitude from the Starport. "**Care to explain that Control?**" he asks, not angry just puzzled.
He glances up at Ketanna, "**It would appear we are on our own.**"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Relieved to be finally getting off the ship Talak ignores the others and makes his way towards the exit. The landing ramp hits the ground at about the same time as Talak's jaw. There's a rather large, angry looking man outside holding a ridiculously large lightsaber. At first surprise, then annoyance course through the young apprentice. How dare he assault their ship, and more importantly how dare he get between Talak and the way off this crate!
Talak quickly draws both his lightsaber and discblade once he's recovered from the shock. As the green blade of his lightsaber springs to life, he confronts the stranger. "**Umm, what are you doing?**"
((Two move actions to draw both weapons))

Tâ€™iallo unleashes the full extent of his fury on the cargo bay hatch, slashing downward into the metal. The shipâ€™s engineers would be proud, however, that it challenges his lightsaber every millimetre of the way. The experience is less like cutting through butter, and more alike to cutting through tough treacle.
Elashi tries to reason with her Master through the telepathic link, desperate to bring him back from the brink. But it seems impossible to make her mental voice heard, and almost painful to try. She competes futilely against a towering inferno of rage.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Controlâ€™s reply is a short while in coming. When it does, the woman on the other hand sounds regretful and even mortified, genuinely sorry to be the bearer of what she clearly believes is bad newsâ€”
â€˜*Sunbug*, youâ€™ve landed in the new path of the Sluuvath Migration. Itâ€™s predicted that theyâ€™ll be upon you in minutes. Your only chance is to fix your engines and get off the ground.â€™
Of course, this has little impact on Kaito as he has no idea what the Sluuvath Migration is and nor do Ketanna or Gunsan. It seems evident that whatever it is, however, itâ€™s really bad news.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qurâ€™aiden and Orllovrllel go about the task of clearing the cargo bay. As they do so, Talak enters the bay. The three Jedi acknowledge each other in passing and Talak hurries to open the *Sunbug*â€™s hatch and lower the ramp, obviously feeling under the weather from the journey.
As Talak reaches for the hatch release Orllovrllel is overcome with an overwhelming sensation of wrongness. He is suddenly certain that there is something dangerous outside. He drops the crate in his arms and begins to roar out a warning. Both his own apprentice and Ketannaâ€™s look towards him, but itâ€™s too late. The hatch release switch is more than halfway down in Talakâ€™s hand.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before Tâ€™iallo can renew his assault, the hatch slides open with a hiss and the boarding ramp slides down, forcing him to leap aside. On the other side he sees a young brown-haired human. Further into the bay a wookiee and a white-haired humanoid with bandaged eyes are both looking at him. To his eyes all three seem sinister, though as yet they have not acted against him.
((Tâ€™iallo deals 32 damage to the boarding ramp but fails to break through. Then it is opened for him, of course. Everyone is surprised, so no surprise round. Initiative is as follows: T'iallo â€“ 36; Kaito â€“ 31; Talak â€“ 24; Ketanna â€“ 23; Qur'aiden â€“ 22; Elashi â€“ 20; Orllovrllel â€“ 19; Gunsan â€“ 13))

Following Kaito's suggestion, Gunsan wanders toward the back of the ship, looking for Qur'Aiden. If anyone could fix the engines, it was going to have to be Orllo's hot-headed apprentice. As he enters the cargo bay--where the boy is sure to be overlooking his speeder bike--Talak is just opening the hatch. Not really caring what Talak is up to, he walks right on by the hatch--and stops dead in his tracks. Outside with Talak stands a golden-skinned man, who looks none too friendly.
Acting more on instinct than anything else, he draws the Force around him, letting it bend the light around him so that he was invisible to all. His hand is already drawing the blaster at his hip and pointing it at the enraged man. He didn't need to shoot--not yet. The other man got to act first, if he didn't attack, Gunsan wouldn't have to.
(Standard: Use Cloak, UtF+16
Move: Draw Blaster)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orllo drops the crate, as something seemed to trigger in the back of his consciousness, almost an innate sense of danger approaching. Orllo turns immediately to face the door as Talak opened it, to see the golden-skinned man with the yellow lightsaber standing directly outside it.
Orllo stands there calmly, not so much as even twitching toward the lightsaber on his belt, completely unfazed by their attacker. <We wish you no harm,> he growls. <But I am a Wookiee. I will not hesitate to rip off your arms and stuff them so far down your throat that they come out the other side.> That statement wasn't a threat, but merely a fact. He is a Wookiee, after all.
When he could see his words were not registering with the man, he turns to Qur'Aiden. <Tell him what I said, young one.> He pauses, before adding, <And try to be somewhat accurate this time.>

**"Hello."**
T'iallo smirks sardonically at the youth as he becomes visible, delighting in Talak's surprise. The Firrerreoan extends a hand and flicks his wrist, attempting to fling the apprentice back into the cargo bay using the Force. Then with a snarling roar he's charging up the boarding ramp at the Wookie.
Somewhere amidst his clouded thoughts, he hears Elashi pleading with him. He wrestles within his own mind, but in the end her echoing cries only spurring them on, his thoughts warping them into her begging for him to save her from all those onboard the freighter. He rushes at Orllovrllel, the tip of his massive lightsaber trailing on the ground and scoring the cargo bay floor.
**(Standard Action: Move Object +17 on Talak to throw him the full 6 squares elsewhere)
(Move Action: Move towards Orllovrllel)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden jumps as his Master drops his crate right next to him, his white hair tossing as he looks around the cargo bay for what startled the Wookie. The Miralukan doesn't have to look for long as Talak lowers the boarding ramp and the gold-skinned man with the unnecessarily-long lightsaber comes into view.
**"Who the kriffin' karkin' crap is that?!"**
He looks from his master back to the man as he draws his discblade, a quick shake extending its shark-toothed blades. Qur'aiden listens to Orllovrllel's growls and roars, and his eyebrows threaten to climb off of his face. Cupping his free hand around his lips, he yells over at the Firrerreoan.
**"Hey, tall, furry, and philosophical here says if you don't calm down and act right, he's going to make you poop your shoulder blades!"**
The apprentice looks up at the Errant Master then, a preening grin on his face signifying a job well done.

Ketanna listens as Salcu control apologizes for not being able to assist them. With a frown she asks Kaito, "**Do you know anything about these Sluuvath they are referring to?**" The very fact no one was sending a rescue for them fills Ketanna with concern. She sits at Gunsan's vacated copilot's seat taking a look at the controls. "**I can manage things here if you would like to see to the engines. I have a feeling we will need them operating soon from the sounds of things.**"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Elashi continues toward the now extended ramp and sees her master run up into the bowels of the ship. ***Master… T'iallo, you must stop! Please!…*** Knowing her attempts to plead some sense in him was futile didn't stop her from trying. Pale faced the young Cathar does the only thing she could given the circumstances. Unable to concentrate with her master's raging thoughts stifling her own she severs their connection. The relief was instantaneous and with more sure steps she advances towards the ship. Silently asking for her master's forgiveness even though they were no longer linked, she calls forth using her gift the image of the only person who may get through to her raging master.
Andres Deisser, an older human male with dark hair, appears suddenly and steps from the corner of T'iallo's vision. The armored man holds the Wan-Shen he favors in front of him, leaning against it in a relaxed stance as he considers the raging Firrerreoan. "**This is not the way, T'iallo,**" the illusion says. "**You need to come to your senses.**"

T'iallo blows by Gunsan before the Mon Calamari can even react to his presence, leaving him only to fumble with his blaster instead. He manages to keep the cloak around himself--or, a least, the other man doesn't notice him anyway, so intent is he on the Wookiee.
He keeps his blaster trained on their attacker, ready to fire, if and when he has to. He would have to drop the cloak before he could fire, of course, but he isn't a coward. If and when his allies need him, he would do as he had to. That was what Kot had taught him . . . what Kaito is teaching him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the man dared to board their ship and toss Talak around like he was nothing but a man of straw, Orllo stays calm. The Force is about balance--this man had come to attack them, so Orllo would attack back.
<I warned you. You have no one but your self to take blame on.>
And then a man suddenly appears near their attacker and begs the man, T'iallo, to stop. Whether or not T'iallo would listen, he had to learn not to threaten a Wookiee or his allies. With a single, long stride, he closes the distance to the man and delivers one blow to him. Against most men, that was all that would be needed to get them to think twice about continuing to attack him--if they were still conscious afterwards. He hopes he would not need anymore against the attacker.

Kaito shakes his head, "**No I've never heard of them. Hopefully you can find out more information. I'll go check if Gunsan and Qur'aiden have made any progress.**"
On his way back to the engines Kaito can hear the distinctive hum of lightsabers, but this doesn't seem like the opportune moment for a sparring match. He rounds the corner cautiously and takes in the scene before him. With Ketanna's apprentice lying on the ground in a heap it appears the exchange is not a polite one. Surrendering himself to the Force Kaito slips from sight and draws his lighsaber. If the Wookie Master can't get this under control he'll end it quickly.
((Move: Get to the cargo bay Stealth +18; Move: Draw Lightsaber))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Talak can feel the Force building up in the intruder and knows what's about to happen. When the energy explodes towards him he's ready to divert it but it's just too strong. For a single instance Talak's focus slips and suddenly he's flying through the air. The boy crashes into the crates Orllovrllel had so neatly stacked, scattering them.
Talak winces from the pain but nothing seems to be broken. Now, he's angry. To be cast aside like a child's unwanted plaything is *irritating*. He stands up, shaking his head to clear it and attempt to clamp down on his negative emotions. Still, the man needs to be stopped, and it wouldn't be giving in to his anger to attack back. Even if it did feel good. Talak charges the armored assailant and swings his lightsaber in an aggressive downward slash.

T'iallo disregards the surprised looking Talak as a true threat, mustering the Force to pick the young man up and hurl him across the bay. The apprentice can feel the assault coming and marshals his own energies to repulse it. He just cannot resist the Firrerreoan's strength in the Force, however, and he realises that this man has great power in the Force possibly equal to his master.
Done with Talak, T'iallo charges toward Orllovrllel, his lightsaber melting a line in the floor as it trails behind him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kaito leaves Ketanna in the cockpit with the intention of checking the engines. On his way through the ship he hears peculiar noisesâ€”the hiss and crackle of lightsabers, bangs and crashes, shouts and Wookiee roars. Unlikely to be a sparring match at this time, he reasons, and advances cautiously, his lightsaber springing into hand.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gritting his teeth against the pain and taking a few breaths of recovery, Talak gets quickly to his feet. He rushes to assist Orllovrllel, charging up behind T'iallo and lashing out with his lightsaber. Like the Master, however, his attack proves inadequate to the golden man's evasive skill.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taking the co-pilot's seat, Ketanna has barely time to settle before she feels a sense of wrongness through the Force. Something is happening further into the ship. Something Dark. And yet... she feels there is another danger outside, too. Less immediate, but not less of a threat.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden repeats his master's warning, translating it rather colourfully into Basic. Even as he does so he sees the effort is in vain, sensing with shock and resignation the powerful application of Force that sends his fellow apprentice Talak flying. He draws his discblade, ready to fight, flicking it so that its teeth slide out along the rim.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Elashi breaks the mental link she shares with her master, and immediately feels sweet relief from the dark turmoil of his mind. She settles on a daring plan to bring him back to his right mind, following to the bottom of the boarding ramp and attempting to create a realistic illusion of his master's master. Her skill proves more than adequate to the task, and Andres Deisser steps out from behind the same crates Talak lies sprawled among.
'This is not the way, T'iallo,' the Imperial Knight says, stepping sedately toward his apprentice, 'you need to come to your senses.'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Orllovrllel roars his agreement with Deisser and attempts to hammer the point home. Rather literally. The armoured Firrerreoan proves more nimble than his rash charge would have indicated however, ducking to the side and avoiding Orllo's large hairy fist.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As soon as Gunsan sees what's going on he draws light around him to slip from the sight of those around him, manipulating it masterfully. He draws his blaster, waiting for an opportunity to fire, should he need to.

((* **T'iallo** Move Object [29, beats Talak's Rebuke; throws Talak 6 squares into some crates, deals 28 points of damage and -1 down the Condition Track]; runs 6 squares toward Orllovrllel].

T'iallo wards off the Wookie's tremendous blow, keeping the creature at bay with elongated blade of his greatsaber. He ducks, leaps and bounds away from the various assaults, moving with a predatory grace. With a savage grin, the Firrerreoan prepares to throw himself at Orllovrllel, but the sudden appearance of his master causes him to pause.
**'This is not the way, T'iallo,'** the Imperial Knight says, stepping sedately toward his apprentice, **'you need to come to your senses.'**
The armored warrior takes one stumbling step back, his mouth agape. He sputters as if attempting to find words, but suddenly his mouth clicks shut and his stance squares, as pure hatred contorts his visage.
**"They have turned you against me *di'apa*?! No… You never *were* my father, just a guilt-ridden substitute! I see it all so clearly now; you're not poachers, this is a Sith invasion!"**
With a roar of outrage, T'iallo levels a titanic swipe at the Wookie, intent on swatting him into the blind boy standing behind him.
***Sith! I'm surrounded by Sith! I'll drive them from here! From Salcu! From all of the Cluster, if I must!***
Following the momentum of his swing, the Firrerreoan breaks for wall of the cargo bay, becoming a blurr of movement. It appears as if he's going to sprint directly *through* the hull, but just as he reaches the wall he leaps and continues his sprint along its surface. When he reaches the pinnacle of his advance, the Errant Knight punches the cargo bay wall, using the incredibly sharp claws of his armor to anchor himself.

Qur'aiden pumps a spindly fist as his master proceeds to pummel the mysterious, armored man. He had never seen the Wookie lose a fight, and he fully expected Orrlovrllel to put his massive fist through golden-skinned idiot.
Then a catgirl appeared, followed by another armored man, and then his master missed.
**"…Oh boy."**
The miralukan scrabbles away from the scrum between the armored man and his master with all due haste . He places the Nebula Blazer between he and the Firrerreoan, and when he's gained some measure of cover, he peaks from behind it and hurls his Discblade, the shark-toothed blade whistling as it cuts through the air.

Kaito stares in surprise as another armored intruder suddenly appears out of nowhere. He's used to catching people unaware, not the other way around. Fortunately, the newcomer appears to be trying to help. Unfortunately, he's only making things worse.
Now that their assailant is screaming about a Sith invasion Kaito decides it must be some sort of psychotic episode. However, it's obvious the man has considerable skill, both in the Force and with the lightsaber. The situation needs to be resolved quickly before anyone else gets hurt. Hopefully Kaito can incapacitate him without killing him.
Calling on the Force to grant him both speed and stealth Kaito advances rapidly towards the armored figure on the wall, then springs into the air with a Force-assisted leap. At the apex of his jump the nagai lashes out with a suddenly ignited lightsaber in two rapid strikes.

Talak is impressed as the armored attacker adroitly avoids both his own and Master Orellovrllel's efforts.

As T'iallo sprints up the wall, Gunsan sees his chance. T'iallo is going too far up the wall to reach effectively with a lightsaber but a blaster just might do the trick. He lines up a shot, then realizes this man is too good for him--he'll just bat the blaster bolt aside.
But that's not the only trick Gunsan knows. He is naturally talented in affecting the mind and knows the ins and outs of sentient minds like few others, even masters as strong as Kot. Reaching out with the Force, Gunsan touches the pain centers of T'iallo's brain, then splinters them, hoping to draw the enraged man's focus inwards--if only for a moment--to give the others time to deal with him.
Thoughts of taking cover never occurs to him. Whether or not he breaks their attacker's mind, a skinny Mon Calamari is hardly a threatening target, not with a near-raging Wookiee with ten lightyears, at least.
(Standard: Use Mind Shard, UtF+15)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orllo is surprised when his fist fails to connect with their attacker. It rarely happens, but then again, this man is good, there is no doubt about that. They are going to have to take another approach.
He joins his apprentice behind the Nebula Blazer, letting his mind fall back into the Force. Visions flow into his mind, carried along by the Force. He reaches out to Qur'aiden telepathically, letting these things be seen by the young man, in hopes that maybe they could help him stop their attacker before he causes any real harm.
Then he charges after T'iallo, hoping that this time his fists would show the man why it was never a good idea to mess with a Wookiee.

Elashi's eyes widen as her illusion failed to get through to T'iallo and in the end possibly made it worse. Drawing her lightsaber from her belt she moves forward on the the ship.
Still in control of the illusion she tries to get through to him once again.
Deisser watches T'iallo, apparently nonplussed by the his angry accusations. "**Listen to what you are saying! You are allowing your anger to control your actions. What kind of example are you setting for Elashi?**"
As if on cue Elashi takes her final step into the ship moving as far in as she can in sight of her master. Pale faced from his earlier mental assualt, she despretly pleads with him, "**Master, we have to leave here. We're running out of time! What has gotten into you?**"

T'iallo raises his lightsaber high and brings it smashing down, more like a club than an elegant blade. The crackling weapon skims past Orllo's shoulder as the wookiee master sidesteps neatly to avoid the brutal attack. The blade hits the floor, slightly melting a circular patch of durasteel before being whipped upward.
Despite this failure, the Firrerreoan master is not about to give up. He moves at speed to the edge of the cargo bay, neatly avoiding the parting attacks aimed at him. T'iallo makes the transition from horizontal to vertical plane with ridiculous ease, running up the wall without even altering his stride. His attempt to find purchase at the top is thwarted, however, and instead he drops, twisting his body in the air to land atop some stacked crates in a crouching position, arm outstretched and his saber held out behind him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kaito moves quickly through the bay toward T'iallo, using the various crates and boxes as cover to keep T'iallo from easily seeing the approach of another threat.
Reaching the crate as the golden-skinned man falls he jumps, his movement enhanced by the Force, easily clearing the distance required to bring him within easy striking range of his target's back. His aim is true, but his target is too wily. Aware of the threat at the last instant, T'iallo raises his lightsaber behind him and blocks the assault.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Talak, meanwhile, continues to recover from his rough treatment at the hands of the interloper. While he breathes in and out, letting his body and the Force work together, he reaches out with his mind to summon his master to help.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ketanna's question seems to leave the voice of Control momentarily stumped.
'Well,' she replies hesitantly, 'they're big. Really big. And they burrow beneath the surface, which causes tremors. Earthquakes. Destruction. If there's any way you can get off the ground, *Sunbug*, I suggest you take it.'
The Codru-Ji suddenly finds herself the subject of telepathic contact from her apprentice. The message: danger.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not wishing to be caught in the battle of the Titans erupting between his master and their foe, Qur'aiden finds cover behind his pride and joy, the *Nebula Blazer*. As T'iallo climbs the wall he lets fly with his discblade, the jagged halo whistling across the cargo bay. T'iallo drops at this point, and the weapon clatters harmlessly against the wall and drops out of site behind the crates now bearing host to Qur'aiden's intended target.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Worry for her master growing by the moment, and fearing her illusion has sent him over the edge, Elashi has little choice but to press on and hope for things to turn around as she enters the ship and draws her lightsaber. This time she adds her own pleas to that of the illusory Imperial Knight.
Deisser watches T'iallo, apparently nonplussed by the his angry accusations. 'Listen to what you are saying! You are allowing your anger to control your actions. What kind of example are you setting for Elashi?'
As if on cue Elashi takes her final step into the ship moving as far in as she can in sight of her master. Pale faced from his earlier mental assualt, she despretly pleads with him, 'Master, we have to leave here. We're running out of time! What has gotten into you?'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Orllovrllel chases after his foe, but is unable to follow the man up the wall. He turns as T'iallo drops to the crate, and lunges upward to try and connect a fist on the momentarily vulnerable Firrerreoan. Yet he snaps the fist back quickly as T'iallo's lightsaber arcs around where the wookie's arm would have been, ending up behind his back in a beautifully executed and apparently instinctual defensive maneuver that both kept Orllo at bay and, apparently, defended against his fellow master Kaito, who attempted to strike from behind in the same instant.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gunsan attempts to reach out to T'iallo's mind and cause him pain directly through his pain centres, but finds the mind and will of his target to be strong, impenetrable. More than that, he sees something of what is on the mind, crescendoing rage built upon an odd, unnatural fog.

**"SILENCE, SITHSPAWN! I WILL NOT SUBMIT TO YOUR LIES!"**
T'iallo shouts at the image of his master; at everyone. When Elashi entered the cargo bay, it was as if his worst fears were realized as mental images of the assembled Sith cult slaying her dances through his mind. A sharp pain stabs just behind his eyes, and his vision is clouded and flushed in crimson, but he ignores it all; more Sith deception.
With a tremendous leap, the Errant Master launches himself from the stack of crates like a pouncing Crag Lion, caring little for how exposed he leaves himself. But no sooner do his boots scrape the cargo bay floor is he charging at the Wookie, pure hatred twisting his delicate features.
The Firrerreoans attack becomes a staccato of slashes, chops and lunges, the ferocious attack seeming to have little to no form or patterning to it. Crates are scarred, the floor is scorched, and even the Nebula Blazer takes a few sizzling nicks as T'iallo throws the entirety of himself at Orllovrllel, well beyond regard for his own life so long as his enemies lay broken before him.

Outstretching both hands, he summons every loose tool, sharp shard of wood and small crate he can manage, hurling a telekinetic hailstorm of detritus at the armored warrior.
**"Suck a Hutt, we ain't kriffin' Sith!"**
Afterwards, he makes a bee-line for where his discblade landed, mentally berating himself for the rookie mistake in the heat of battle.

Kaito's lips purse in a grim expression. The intruder is becoming increasingly more deranged and proving harder to incapacitate than he expected. This can't go on much longer without someone getting seriously injured.
Reaching out with the Force he grabs an open can of oil that Qur'aiden had been using on the Nebula Blazer and hurls it towards the firrerreon's helmeted face. Kaito then dives into a tumbling roll and comes up behind his opponent, hoping to take advantage of the distraction. In rapid succession he delivers two precise strikes intended to disable the crazed assailant.
((Acrobatics +14, Utf +18, Swift: Use Blind; Move: Get into a flanking position with Orllovrllel if possible (if Blind fails he'll tumble to avoid an attack of opportunity); Standard: Force Point to regain Saber Swarm and attack with it, Lightsaber +15 (2d8+15 plus Dastardly Strike)))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Talak returns his focus to the here and now, confident that his master received the message. He turns to what appears to be a similarly armored figure as their attacker, "**He's obviously not listening so do something before somebody gets killed!**".
Worried that he might accidently hit one of the masters if he tries throwing his discblade into the melee Talak instead draws on the Force. "**Let's see how *you* like being tossed around like a rag doll**," he mutters under his breath and attempts to pick the firrerreon up with the Force only to slam him back down on the deck. Perhaps the shock will clear the man's murderous rage...or put him unconscious.

As T'iallo continued his assault on Orllo, the Wookiee realizes that to fight his attacker, he needed a different tactic, a more ruthless one. He gave up his calmer side for the wild rage of the Wookiee. The change was instantaneous and marked by a deafening roar that escaped his lips.
He turned and struck out at his attacker with a ferocity he rarely displayed. The force behind the blow was enough to kill some men, but Orllo didn't think about that. Surrendered to the rage, he didn't think about much of anything, other than finishing the fight by any means necessary.

While he talked, he kept his blaster trained on the man, ready to shoot him if he had to. "Is this . . . I mean, is he always like this? Something just doesn't feel right to me."
As she gave whatever answer she had, Gunsan closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Like Kot, and now Kaito, had taught him, he listened to the Force, letting it guide his actions.

The armored man Talak addresses glances at him and then back at T'iallo. "**There's nothing more I can do.**" With a blink of an eye the man disappears.
Elashi glances around desperately, searching for some way out. What else could she do but attack her own master? Words hadn't worked, from her or the man he considered father. All she knows is he either needs to come to his senses, or he needs to be subdued. Both of them had to be done quickly.
Not hearing as Gunsan as he speaks to her, she makes a decision. She charges forward toward T'iallo, her lightsaber still unlit in her hand. Reaching toward him with her free hand she attempted to grab the Firrerreoan master's arm, if only for just a moment.
"**Master, if I am an illusion then strike me down so you may see the truth behind the lies… THIS IS NO SITH DECEPTION!**. She stresses the last part, her final act of desperation. If he was still her master, the man she had grown to know the last two years, then he wouldn't harm her. If he did, well, she would have her answer.
As she spoke she prepares herself to dodge quickly out of the way of any lethal stroke, if any, T'iallo may send her way.

Ketanna glances back behind her, her uneasines doubling as she recieves the telepathic message from her apprentice. Standing, she quickly draws two of her discblades, holding them in her lower arms as she dashes toward the cargo bay of the *Sunbug*.
*What is going on? Are these Sluuvath already here?*
As she bursts into the cargo bay she takes a look around. "**What is going on here!?**" she asks, verbalizing her earlier thoughts hoping for an answer.

Screaming and raging, T'iallo leaps from the crates, looking for all the world like a feral beast as he flies over Orllovrllel's head. The wookiee master punches upward, seeing a vulnerability that his opponent has never previously exposed, and is rewarded for his effort by the feel of his fist's connection with the golden man's flank, at once sickening and satisfying.
T'iallo grunts in pain but has the sense to roll slightly in the air, falling to the ground slightly off from his intended destination but his plan otherwise affected. He roars and leaps forward, swinging violently with his saber. His wookiee target moves aside just in time to avoid a disembowelling, but still feels a hot sensation on his skin and smells the acrid scent of burning fur in his senstive nostrils.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kaito chases after T'iallo, attempting to blind him with a can of oil as he does so. The can misses, Tiallo twisting violently underneath it and avoiding even so much as a spatter from the spilling liquid. Passing by Orllovrllel, Kaito lunges forward and comes up rolling, deflecting with his lightsaber a swing directed at his passing form.
He comes to his feet opposite the enemy from Orllo and takes a swing, but finds his attack deflected as easily as he had blocked their attempt.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Getting his sweet revenge, Talak chooses to target the Firrerreoan directly with the Force. T'iallo is smashed violently against the floor, crashing his jaw against the plasteel.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Codru-Ji master Ketanna hurries through the ship to the scene of the disturbance, but is forced to wait at several doors. Automatic they may be, but the movement of each eats valuable seconds, and she just reaches the cargo bay in time to see a golden-skinned stranger in a beast-shaped helmet forced against the floor.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With a sudden understand and openness to the Force granted through his connection to his Master, Qur'aiden calls forth a swarm of smaller items from around the cargo bay. He is momentarily surprised by just how effective this is, a large cloud of tools, small boxes, and spare parts clanging against each other above his head. He sends them hurtling toward the Firrerreoan who so nearly cut open his Master, and more rather than less find their mark.
Even as they do so, Qur'aiden is hurrying around the crates in the direction of his fallen discblade.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Elashi rushes towards the conflict as T'iallo is pushed to the floor, reaching out and touching his arm.
'Master, if I am an illusion then strike me down so you may see the truth behind the lies... THIS IS NO SITH DECEPTION!'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Almost killed by his opponent, Orllo unchains his wookiee spirit and pummels at his foe, barely registering the fact that T'iallo is now on the floor and at this point not even caring. Nor does he register the other stranger who has involved herself in the combat, except perhaps as another potential foe. His fist connects with T'iallo again, painfully hitting his helmeted head.
T'iallo's vision swims as he fights hard to remain conscious.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlike his companions, Gunsan does not attack. Instead he searches inwardly, trusting his feelings to put him on the right course. And then he knows, with a certainty, that it would be a bad thing to continue attacking the man with such lethal force.
Barely a second later, a huge feline leaps from the long grass outside and through the open hatch. By the sounds of the roars that follow it, it is not alone.

Struggling through the haze of pain and unfettered rage clouding his mind, T'iallo groggily turns his head as the Crag Lions make their roaring entrance.
**"Don't you dare hurt them! Have to save them… Have to save Elashi… Have to save everyone from…"**
***From who?***
The thought pierces through the fog clouding his mind, like a shaft of light striking through steel-grey sky. He shakes his head, trying to grasp a hold of the thought, but his faculties were tenuous at best. Roaring through gritted teeth, he leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain, the haze, and the ring of attackers surrounding him in an attempt to make a break for the Crag Lions.
**"Run! Flee from here, you are in danger! Don't you see Elashi, you're all in danger unless I stop them!"**
T'iallo shouts at the Crag Lions with all the strength he has remaining in his lungs as he attempts to break through the throng of suspected-Sith. He lowers his head and barrels forward, taking on any manner of pain and even the threat of death to get to Elashi and the Crag Lions.

As the apprentice comes running around the crates, spouting his blowhard threats, the sight of the massive felines draws him up short. Behind the linen bandages wrapping his eyes, he blinks; a learned expression from years of living around the sighted. He looks to where the ring of masters has the armored psycho pinned down and nods to himself, then looks back to where the *Sunbug* is rapidly taking on new passengers.
**"…Well ain't we just kriffin' popular."**
With a overhand-heave, Qur'aiden throws his discblade at the handle to the boarding ramp control, manipulating the razor-sharp weapon in an attempt to close the hatch.

Kaito lets the armored man pass, he's not interested in continuing the assault if it isn't necessary. The nagai walks calmly towards the lions and, judging by the similarities between the man's armor and the creatures, perhaps their master. His stance is not aggressive yet it's clear that he means to bar the way. Most sentients find Kaito's voice to be exceptionally soothing, perhaps now he can finally get through the fog clouding their visitor's mind.
"**The danger you are in is entirely of your own making. We mean you and your friends no harm, but we will defend ourselves. Please, let us set aside violence and converse as reasonable beings.**"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Talak blinks in surprise as the man he just berated suddenly disappears. He shakes his head in confusion and then smiles with relief now that his master has arrived. Moving towards her he responds to her question, though he's not particularly helpful.
"**I'm not sure Master, I don't think anybody really is…That man threw me across the room and started screaming about a sith invasion while attacking Master Orllovrllel.**"
Talak's relief is short lived however when several rather large cats enter the hold. He tightens his grip on the discblade and prepares to throw it should the lions prove hostile.

As their mysterious attack runs off to attack the crag lion, Orllo is not far behind. The enraged Wookiee leaps at the crag lion, caring little for his own safety and only to stop this invading creature. He would rip the limbs off this creature, then he could take care of the invader--if he survived that long.

Guided by the Force, Gunsan is about to shout for the others to stop attacking T'iallo when a crag lion appears in the doorway. Gunsan leaps into action, raising his blaster, but hesitates in firing when his master does not. T'iallo may not be someone they wanted to attack and he could sure shoot the lions, but if Kaito wasn't going to attack, he wasn't going to. Some might see that as foolish, but Kot had taught him better.
"Don't attack T'iallo," Gunsan shouts as a warning to his master. "Something's . . . wrong. Just don't kill him. Not yet."

Elashi looks up startled to see the lions and at first she's worried. As T'iallo moves to place himself between the lions and the supposed Sith she moves with him. Placing herself between her master and the occupants of the ship she tries to be calm as she says, "**Master, it's the Sluuvath we need to be concerned about.**" She doesn't want to say it but she's rather concerned about their chances now that the craig lions have made an appearance.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Ketanna nods, the action most likely unseen by her apprentice as his attention is diverted to the large cats which have made an appearance. With her discblades in hand she watches the cats and the other intruders intensely, waiting to see if they will continue their attack. "**We need to get our engines fixed or our 'guests' will be the least of our troubles,**" the Codru-ji said loudly, hoping to catch the attention of one of the mechanics in the group so they will get to work.

With cold certainly, T'iallo suddenly realises his thoughts have not been his own. How could he have been so blinded. What is the alien feeling in his system? For it isn't gone, not yet. He's mastered it, for now and probably for good, but he can feel it there now, an unpleasant and invasive substance in his system.
This is nothing, though. He is a jedi and he can overcome. More pressing though are the crag lions that have just arrived. No doubt they are fleeing in front of the Sluuvath, and couldn't resist the chance discovery of prey in their path.
He struggles to his feet despite all the pain and hurries to put himself between the other jedi and the beasts.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kaito follows the golden man, stopping short of him but ready to step in and fight if either he or the huge lions renews the attack.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Talak hurries to where his Master has entered the cargo bay, where quickly explains the background of the wild scenario. He keeps his eyes on the crag lions, ready to throw his discblade at the slightest movement.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ketanna listens to her apprentice's report then delivers news of her own, loudly enough to be heard over the roars of the lions. Like Talak, the Codru-ji readies her discblade to attack.
'We need to get our engines fixed or our 'guests' will be the least of our troubles!'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden returns with his discblade in time to see the ginormous feline invasion. Thinking fast he lets fly with his discblade, the razor-edged ring flashing through the hold and hitting the bay door controls dead on. The blade embeds itself in amongst the wiring, severing several bundles of cables. As sparks fly from the controls, the door's emergency routines kick in and the ramp begins to rise.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Elashi returns to her Master. She senses, finally, that he has returned to his own senses. Nothing will erase the worry caused by his breakdown, but for now he is himself and the circumstances are too dire to waste time on idle discussion.
She reminds T'iallo of the approaching Sluuvath, taking her place at his side.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Already too deep in his rage to easily snap out, Orllo has just enough self-control to change target, the firrerreoan apparently now not a threat. Instead he charges and leaps at the crag lion, pounding it upon the flank with a mighty fist.
It roars in pain, staggering a step despite its size.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The beast turns and takes a swipe at its attacker, but the wookiee staggers backward as though drunk and avoids the massive paw. It may not be a graceful movement, but it leaves him unharmed.
A second lion leaps onto the ramp as it raises, but yowls in agony and rage as its haunches are caught in the entrance. A third lion's paws appear on the edge momentarily, scrabbling for purchase, but drop away.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taking his cue from his Nagaian Master, Gunsan doesn't immediately attack, instead only taking aim with his blaster.
'Don't attack T'iallo,' he shouts, revealing the insight he has acquired, 'Something's ... wrong. Just don't kill him. Not yet.'

Orllo continues to battle the crag lion, adding blow after blow to the creature in hopes of felling. Well, there would be hopes if he bothers to think at all. But the rage is overwhelming and the crag lion is going to feel the brunt of it, one way or the other.
He roars again--a deep roar that is deafening to everyone nearby. It is filled with nothing but the wild Wookiee covering up every part of the contemplative master.

The second crag lion catches Gunsan offguard. The Mon Calamari lets loose an old spacer's curse and fires at it instinctively, hoping to the Force that no one gets in his way.
This is turning into some mission. They hadn't even been landed ten minutes and they'd been involved in two fights. Back when he'd been your average spacer, it usually took thirty. Still, there was something to be said for the excitement of the Jedi life.

As Elashi moves to stand with her master, she ignites her saber. Facing the lions, she hopes after these last few years of helping her master to protect them from poachers, she now doesn't have to cut one or two of them down. Standing ready, she prepares to attack the next lion which attacks the others in retaliation.

Ketanna eyes the intruding crag lions and decisively calls, "**Qur'aiden, we need the engines fixed. Now! Let us handle this**." The lions would be easily managed by them and while she hated to order another's apprentice around, his master wasn't exactly in the right mindset to do so. The lions would be the least of their problems if the couldn't get off the ground.
With her discblade in hand she sends it flying, attacking both lions as she controls the trajectory of the blades with the Force and then recalling it to her hand.

Kaito hopes killing the lions won't throw the firrereon back into a rage, considering the armor he obviously admires them, but they can't be allowed to continue attacking. Sooner or later one of those big paws might connect, and even a Wookie would notice the wound. Seeing no other choice he steps forward to engage the lions. The nagai brings his lightsaber down in a vicious overhand chop, he'll attempt to at least make it quick.

T'iallo steps forward to intervene in the battle between Orllo and the Crag Lion, but is suddenly overcome with nausea. He grunts in pain and stumbles to his knees. He retains enough presence of mind to throw himself sideways to avoid being struck by a stray blow, then attempts to control his breathing and regulate the flow of the Force throughout his body.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kaito moves forward to support his Wookiee peer, determined to end this fight quickly. He weaves through Orllo's barbaric melee with the crag lion with grace, dodging past claws, fangs, and terrifyingly muscular limbs with the apparent ease to be expected of a qualified Errant Master. The Nagai rolls underneath the animal, raking his lightsaber along its belly. It screeches, and he rolls out from under the lion just in time as it stomps a paw down hard enough to shake the ship.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Talak lets fly with his discblade, which crosses the cargo bay as a flash of silver, curling in an arc which tears at the trapped crag lion's flesh before returning the blade to his hand wet with fresh blood. The beast roars, a sound that might bring terror to the hearts of all present were they not jedi.
'What's coming, Master?' he cries to be heard over the sounds of the lions and the Wookiee.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'Qur'aiden, we need the engines fixed. Now! Let us handle this,' Ketanna calls.
She then attacks in like manner to her apprentice, though her skill with the discblade is far greater. The Force guides her weapon as it curves from one crag lion to the next, its trail described in the air and on the cargo bay floor by a spattering of blood.
The Codru-ji is rewarded by the grim realisation that hers has been the finishing blow on both creatures. The crag lion caught in the bay door screams once more then abruptly stops its struggles, while the one already in the bay, battered and weak already, struggles to move as a leg gives way and its strength is sapped by the onset of a slow and agonising death.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'Yes ma'am,' Qur'aiden shouts in acknowledgement of Ketanna's instruction, sprinting full pelt through the cargo bay in the direction of the engines. Normally he wouldn't have accepted the instruction without at least confirmation from his own Master, but Orllo seems more than a little preoccupied right now, and common sense is on the Codru-ji's side in the first place.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Elashi steps in front of T'iallo as he stumbles. Her Master is clearly unwell, and must be protected. Though, she realises, the danger is temporarily over. One of the crag lions is dead, and the other is as good as, though it vainly attempts to deny it with its every pained movement.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terrifying in his frenzy, the Wookiee Master Orllo continues his assault on the gigantic lion in front of him, unaware that is has already been bested, knowing only that it still moves. He easily dodges its weak swipes and leaps up upon its back, clambering up its body to its neck. Unleashing a primal bellow, Orllo strikes at the animal's spine, breaking it instantly.
The beast collapses to the ground, whining pitifully and brokenly. In the long moment of its death, it is clear that the creature is no monster, but just a cat. With a final mournful cry it dies, eyes glazing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Both crag lions within the bay are dead, but the third outside reminds the jedi of its presence by battering the bay door. Further, the mechanisms controlling the door itself are beginning to whine under the strain of their ongoing attempt at closing with a huge animal blocking the way.

Ketanna moves to stand beside her apprentice her focus still on the corpse of the trapped lion. With a sharp push using the Force, she attempts to dislodge the lion's corpse out from the edge of the closing ramp. If that doesn't seem to work, she holds the ramp open just enough for someone else to push the beast out.
"Creatures called Sluuvath are approaching. Control told us to get off the ground as quickly as possible to avoid the coming quakes." Wearily she looks over at the two strangers, wondering what light they could shed on the situation.
((Move object +18))
-----------------------------------------------------
With the immediate threat of the lions gone, Elashi's full attention turns to T'iallo. "Master?" she asks in a low voice. The one word asking if he was alright. Physically she knew he had taken quite a beating, but such wounds would heal. At the moment she is more concerned about his mental state and hesitantly she re-initiates their mental contact.

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-14 14:48:15)

With a final, triumphant roar, Orllo watches as the crag lions dies. He gazes around, his golden eyes more animal now than sentient. Seeing no other threats, the rage leaves him and he collapses to his knees beside the dead beast. The Rage always took his strength, but it will return, as it always does.
He closes his eyes to meditate, purging the last of the beast within him from his thoughts. Now is the time to regain harmony, to balance the beast with the sentient mind in slow meditation. He knows his apprentice is taking care of the engines--they are in good hands and there was little for him to do. And so he rests.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gunsan waits too long to act, and so the last of the beasts dies before his eyes as he stares down the barrel of his blaster. Cursing his inaction, he returns his blaster to his hip holster and looks around. As Qur'aiden heads for the engines, Gunsan quickly follows. He may not be as great a mechanic as the boy, but he knows his way around a repulsor drive. He is certainly not going to stand around and wait to act again.

It is all T'iallo can do to maintain his awareness as the wave of nausea sweeps over him, bringing him to his knees. With the last of his strength, he throws himself sideways, just narrowly avoiding a massive feline paw.
**"Please… Stop…"**
Now prone on the floor of the storage bay, the Firrerreoan has a front row view of the death of the Crag Lions, his words coming out in a ragged whisper. An anguished roar, and a Lion's last breath carry him into oblivion.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**"Crazy Kriffin' cat-people… Crazy Kriffin *cats*! Whole lot of you can suck a Sarlacc…"**
The Miralukan is a blur of childish epitaphs and furious motion as he flies around the engine bay, attempting to coax the sluggish freighter back to life. His cursing is sometimes punctuate by a wayward arc of electricity or a spontaneous fire, but the apprentice seems to little notice as he tames the calamities and goes about his business.

Ketanna's mental nudge results in a sickening crunch as some of the crag lion's ribs shatter and it is expelled from the ship. A hiss and a roar from outside let the Errant Knights know at least one is still out there before the door closes fully.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qur'aiden tackles the damaged engines fearlessly, not even batting an eye at their advanced state of disrepair—of course, he is physically incapable of batting an eye so may simply have an easier time keeping a poker face.
Gunsan arrives shortly after and pitches in. Though he is skilled, Qur'aiden is only one man and his fellow apprentice's help proves valuable.
They have yet to repair the engines, but have at least halted the worst of the damage.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kaito listens to Ketanna's brief explanation and is quick to react.
'I'll wait in the cockpit and prep for flight,' he states, turning quickly and hurrying from the cargo bay.
Her apprentice Talak, meanwhile, cautiously approaches Elashi.
'Who *are* you two?' he asks as he brushes some stray brown hairs from in front of his eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oblivion is sweet. Yet T'iallo is conscious enough despite his state to begin the arduous process of purging the poisons from his body. Beads of sweat form on his skin and his lips part in a soft moan.

Having crouched at her master's side as he collapsed to the ground, Elashi takes a protective stance over her master, still unsure as to their status on this ship. Her master had after all attacked them unprovoked. "Elashi," she supplies to the approaching human, providing no further explanation as to who they are. Ever distrustful of strangers, she shoots the man a glare. A warning not to come any closer. As T'iallo moans she looks down at him, momentarily distracted, worry creasing her face.
------------------------------------------------------
Ketanna watches the exchange between her apprentice and the Cathar girl with mild curiosity. Her face however is neutral and calm, belaying the concern over the large lion still prowling outside the ship and the coming danger of the Sluuvath. She leans against a nearby bulkhead ready for the current situation to become hostile. A discblade remaining hidden in one of her hands under her cloak.
