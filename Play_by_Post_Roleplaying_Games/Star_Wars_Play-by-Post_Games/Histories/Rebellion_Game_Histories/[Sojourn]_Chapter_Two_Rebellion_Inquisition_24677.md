Your ship exits hyper space one week after escaping Tatooine. You find yourselves in the Tovack system, a good sign that the navigation system is working properly. Running a scan on the system the ships computer displays the results mixed in with the ships data base records.
The Tovack system: A system with 6 gas giants named Tovack 1 through 6, named after the explorer who discovered the system in 982BBY. Each multi-colored planet supports various moon satellites, none of which are capable of supporting life. The absence of a life sustaining planet in this system has keep it relatively obscure from the near by hyper space lanes.
The whole system radiates mild ionic radiation which diminishes sensors and com systems. The systems sun reflects off many of the local gas giants atmosphere creating an orange spectrum across the area. Even with the reduced sensor efficiency the gas giants read turbulent atmospheres, swarming with raging storms it would be tricky to say the least to navigate within one of the planets.
Not much information there, SBC enters the cockpit with your group shortly after entering the system. "Come to a full stop and wait one hour. We will receive a message, copy and resend the message three times in one minute intervals." To the droids word one hour later a single message is received by the ships communication system origin unknown. The message reads "Hold position."

Kasga's alarm notified him when they were about to exit hyperspace. Setting into the pilot's seat, he was waiting when the ship actually exited hyperspace. SBC had the protocol for contacting his "employer". Kasga was on the sensor console when the message came in. Kasga recorded it and rebroadcast it thrice in one minute intervals.

After he had awaken and checked over the engine area one last time, they had arrived at there destination. He made his way to the cocpit to see what was up. Upon reaching cocpit. "Dad, are we there yet?" Dex asks with a smirk. "I take it we are where our new benefactor wants us to be?"

The rest of the trip was pretty much quiet. After the sharing stories Chase flet like he knew the others a bit better than before. At least it provided some insight on who they were and where they came from.
With the week of down time on is hands he spent a portion of it in meditation. With the events of the last few weeks he had done little of the practices that he had learned. The first night aboard he spent it in a state of meidtation. He had been taught to go into the "trance" so to speak. It was a way a Jedi could get a night's sleep in half the time. along with sleep it healed the body at faster pace while reducing the body's need for nurishment considerably.
Trying to find time to spend with Tar'ja wasn't that easy. Their were five of then and the droid on the small freighter. Thought the few times he managed to talk with her without the others around were enjoyable.
-------
He flet the ship come out of hyperspace from where he was meditating. Standing up he walked to the cockpit where he followed SBC in. Following the directions they waited for the comm signal that SBC said we would receive. Sure enough one hour later they received a message. Kasga following the instructions relayed the message back.
Closeing his eyes he drew upon the Force and reached out beyond the ship. With practiced ease his senses probed out as far as he was able to. Trying to get a sense of who or what was out there and any feelings or intent hercould pick up on. He opened his eyes half way though this effort.
When finished he he looked at SBC after the Duros had sent the message back for the third and last time. **"How long do we have to wait till we get confirmation of our return message?"**

A week on a ship was boring, though far more wanted than a week on that planet being hunted. However, finding time to simply speak or even have a few minutes of quiet time with Chase were limited and few between, something that annoyed her and made her vow to herself that she'd pull him off to the side for some quiet the first chance she got.
He had taken to meditating at night, and sometimes during the day, it was during those times that she took to cleaning her blaster beside him, being quiet as she could and..happy..actually, to be in his presence. When night came she'd either sleep in a bed, or take up residence beside him again, quietly sleeping against a wall as some odd form of guard.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The jerk of the ship and movement of cloth woke her from her sleep. Looking around from her position nearly buried under a blanket and pillow the Twi'lek emerged, smoothing her clothes before glancing about.
No Chase, No Kasga...where was Diedra or Dex? no matter. The Twi'lek moved out of the sleeping rooms to the cockpit, looking in at the others with a yawn "we here?" she asked softly, not wanting to interrupt anything.
Spotting Chase she moves to his side, leaning up against him, the short time they'd had, had given her a sense of peace around him and comfort, letting her drop a few walls and her guard a bit...not much, but it was a fairly noticeable difference to those that knew her; one such things would be the whole leaning against.

AS Kasga sends the last repeat a message returns "Message reviewed, continue along attached course." The Duros checks the message for the attachment which contains coordinates to he atmosphere of Tovack 3, one of the gas giants. Kasga plots the heading and hits the accelerator.
Inside the planets atmosphere violent winds assault the ship. The atmosphere is made up of layers of various gasses, in some layers the storms are strong enough to throw the ship around. Entering a calm zone of mithous gas your group spots the destination a run down Lurrehulk-class Core Ship. The grey spherical ship has three large flat round additions attached to its lower hull.
As you approach you receive another signal giving you the approach vector to one of the landing bays. As you get closer you can see a few landing bays with various cargo ships, on bay holds a wing of y-wing star fighters. Landing in the bay as directed your ship shares this area with a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle.
The ship lands with only a slight thump as the landing gear settle on the landing bay floor. Kasga runs through the post flight check and Dexter confirms all systems are green. Outside various droids can be seen many of the dated. Two columns of armed guards wearing dark uniforms with a rebellion crest on their chest march to the ships ramp. Once the troopers have setup position just outside the ramp a silver protocol driod enters and waits at the head of the guard column.

Weapons - MIA, check
Shields - ha, check
Hyperdrive stable - check
Fusion reactor charged - check
Sublight lockdown - check
Sigh, so much for this ship. Kasga comments to the cockpit crew in general, **"I'm amazed we made it out alive in this bucket."**
He transfers the System Operators console to his local terminal. He sets the ships sensors into passive mode. Writing a quick subroutine, he sets the ship's computer to log any broadcasts from the ship along with any sweeps it detects from outside the ship.
Finishing up, he locks the system operators console then rises up from the pilot's chair and heads back to his quarters.
He looks over at the rifle he liberated from Rodian back on Tantooine. Again, we are so completely outmatched, the rifle will do no good. Or my Travotti service pistol for that matter. We have little to offer, it would not do to offend the Rebellion when we are trying to join them. 
Kasga unstraps his blaster pistol and lays it upon the bed. He pockets his comlink and steps back out to the common area. He heads for the staging area at the top of the ramp and waits for the others to join him.

### **Yogi** (2010-06-21 12:29:12)

Chase had just finished asking his question about the confirmation message when he heard Tar'ja enter the cockpit. He looked over his shoulder and smiled at her. She had been sleeping when he woke up and he decided to leave her there comfortably asleep. He always knew she was there when he was meditating, watching over him. He could feel her presence pretty easily now. He wasn't sure if it was that their feelings had become stronger or not but he enjoyed their time together.
"We here?" She asked. He gave her a nod as she walked over to him and leaned up against him. His smile remained as he let an arm encircle her waist holding her a little tighter. Even if he hadn't known it was her there was no mistaking the feel of her up against him. Some of her walls and defenses had dropped. Not all of them though. She was still protective of herself. To be honest with himself. this reminded him a bit of the cramped quarters they experiences in the back stock room in the cantina on Tatooine. Remembering that experience he managed to keep almost all of the redness from his cheeks.
With the return message and coordinates received Chase nodded. **"That didn't take long. We best get ready and make ourselves presentable."**
He looked at Tar'ja. **"Shall we go grab our things?"** He turned slightly towards the door and made gesture for her to go first. **"After you."** He said his half smile and a wink just for her.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-06-21 12:40:03)

Tar'ja watches the process of the repeating message and the final giving them the go ahead. She was fairly comfortable beside the Jedi, the simple touch of a hand to her waist with his arm encircled didn't make her tense much anymore, at least now that she knew it was coming and she didn't mind that it was **him** doing it.
"Shall we go grab our things?" he asked her, lifting her head and giving a yawn and short stretch she nods "Best not to keep them waiting much longer." she remarks back grinning at his wink and "After you." Such a gentleman, a rare thing these days but oh how she was lucky to find one of those things.
Moving forward to the room she had been using with him she moves straight to the bed, and her belt she had slung over it during their trip. Placing it back around her waist she checks her blaster; she didn't need to, she'd cleaned it so many times in a therapeutic nature she was certain it was fine, still, old habits. Setting it into it's holster she turns to the Jedi, she wasn't stupid, and she wasn't about to trust people when they weren't even sure if this employer really did work for the rebellion, she wasn't about to go anywhere unarmed if she could help it.
"Ready Chase?" she asked lightly, motioning to him and then the door with a smirk "After you." he got to watch her walk out only fair for him to return the favor.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-06-21 13:03:14)

Chase followed her to the room knowing full well that she knew he was watching her walk. He was glad that she felt comfortable with it. ***Although the walk to the room is much too short."*** He thought to himself.
Arriving in the room they set to the task of grabbing their stuff. He followed suit and grabbed his belt that carried his blaster. Checking the charge and seeing the full he placed it back into the holster and fastened the clip to hold it into place and tied the strings to hold the bottom part of the holster to his leg. Next he grabbed his lightsaber and looked it over. The charge on the cell was fully charged. He stood there for a moment contemplating on weather to carry it openly or concealed. He looked at Tar'ja for help but saw she was still taking care of her things. He nodded his head and hooked it to his belt by the ring on the hilt. ***Why not if it's a trap best to have it readily available.*** He thought. It felt odd to have it exposed like this and it showed on his face as he turned and looked at Tar'ja who was also ready.
He met her at the door. "Ready Chase?" she said softly and she motioned to the door for him. "After you." She said with a playful smirk.
He raised an eyebrow and leaned in slowly to give her a soft kiss. As he pulled away he smiled. **"That's what I like about you Tar'ja, turnaround is fair play."** With that he turned around and walked out of the room leading her to the loading ramp.

### **zerah** (2010-06-21 13:08:34)

Tar'ja was all smiles, for this brief moment of solitude with him. She liked that about him, he wasn't afraid to simply act if need be and it made her feel strange things. Granted she was still learning about those feelings but all the same...they were nice.
As he left before her she chuckled as she watched him a moment before following, she only stayed behind him for a short time though before moving to his side, her hand brushing against his lightly as she moved, looking over to Kasga as they waited "Well now, lets get going." Looking to the ramp she waits for Kasga to lower it so that they could depart for the next part of this strange little adventure.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-06-21 18:50:17)

He felt her come up beside him as he hand lightly brushed against his. He reached out with his hand and grabbed hers as they walked. Here on the ship he didn't care about the affection they showed each other. Out there they would have to be a bit more careful.
He held her hand till they met up with Kasga at the boarding ramp. As she spoke to Kasga about disembarking he withdrew his hand as he went over his gear. His hand lingered near his lightsaber that swung free from his belt. He was beginning to have reservations about carrying it openly. He looked up to the two of them. **"I was going to carry it openly as I'm sure that it's known but I'm not so sure. I'm sure that how ever low the risk may be for Imperial spies here, I'm not sure I want to take the chance."** He held the weapon in his hand as it was still hooked to his belt.
***I wonder if Skywalker openly carries his.*** He had heard the rumors about Skywalker and his possible link to the force. ***Someday I'd like to meet him. See if the rumors are true.*** He thought to himself as he waited for the opinion of the others.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-06-21 18:54:27)

Tar'ja glances over to the Jedi at her side, eying his belt and saber with a hum, the feel of his hand the warmth of it was missed already from her own, but it was time to regain the vague separation between them to not show the connection, lest it be used against them.
"I don't see why you would have to hide anymore but I see your point, were I able to hide the color of my skin truly I wonder if I would but..." she frowns "we go in armed, not trusting them already to be who we think and hope..perhaps it might be best to hide it..for now."

---

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2010-06-21 21:50:52)

As they land Dex checks over the ship systems and shuts them down and readies himself and his gear for what may lay ahead. "So should I head out and meet our new friends, or would one of you like to?" He looks around at his friends. "I would be more then happy to be the voice of our little team if that is good with everyone." Dex smiles straightening his cloak and make sure he looks presentable. "How do I look?" Asking the person closest to him.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-06-21 22:20:16)

"I don't see why you would have to hide anymore but I see your point, were I able to hide the color of my skin truly I wonder if I would but..." She paused for a moment as a slight frown crossed her features. "...we go in armed, not trusting them already to be who we think and hope..perhaps it might be best to hide it..for now."
He nodded slightly as he unhooked his weapon and moved it to the concealable holster that he normally kept it in. When he did so he looked at Kasga and noticed that the Duros was going sans weapons. **"You sure you don't want your service pistol? I can't really see them not understanding that we don't want to be unarmed."**
Before Kasga could answer Dex walked up all prepped for action as he proposed a course of action. "So should I head out and meet our new friends, or would one of you like to?" The Bothan said as he looked at them. "I would be more then happy to be the voice of our little team if that is good with everyone." The Jedi's eyes went wide as he looked at Tar'ja and Kasga when the words left Dexters mouth. Immediately his thoughts went back to the cantina when they were planning on what to do when Dex just decided to leave before a plan was set. Or how his attempts at dealing with people didn't go over so well.
He shook his head. **"Actually Dex while that sounds like a good idea maybe SBC should lead us out as he is familiar with them. If they see him they will be less likely to be overly suspicious. If you go out and try to sweat talk them tight off the cuff…well lets say I rather not take that chance. "**
He looked at the other two for help. **"Does that make more sense to you two? Now that I mention it. Where is SBC?"** He looked at them and back to Dex. ***Please help me out here.*** He thought to himself.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2010-06-21 22:31:21)

Dex looks at Chase. "I guess I see your point. I guess I am not as smooth a talker as like to think myself to be." Dex finishes striaghting his cloak. "I still ok right? Wouldn't want our new employer to think ill of us if one of us looked like we just came fell off the cart as it where." Dex smiles at his friends. He was a little hurt, but his friends where right. His attempts at diplomacy where not the greatest but he was working on it.

Chase saw the look on the Bothans face and felt what he thought was disappointment through the Force.
**"Don't worry about it Dex. While you may not be a sweet talker I think your area of expertise has shown itself several times already. Your ability to fix things. With out you we never would have made the jump to hyperspace a week ago. If that hadn't happened we'd either be dead or worse."** He said as he patted the Bothan on the shoulder.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-06-22 13:56:42)

Tar'ja nods her head as she looks over the bothan "As Chase said, SBC is the one that brought us here, it'd probably be safer if SBC was the first one they saw." She looks to the three men "For that matter it'll be safer if he does all of the talking until we meet this employer." Sighing she looks about her, SBC wasn't out yet...and where was Deidra? she wasn't still sleeping was she?
"Chase? did Deidra wake up yet?"

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **master_Tru** (2010-06-22 14:27:43)

With most of your group waiting at the ramp, SBC walks in and pauses. "AH if you could open the ramp please." The droid nods to Kasga who flips the switch. The ramp lowers with a dull thud. At the bottom of the ramp rebel guards stand at attention in two lines of six. The silver droid looks up to SBC and begins a series of beeps which SBC reply's with a series of beeps of his own.
For Kasga and Tar`ja only
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"Greatings SBC-54, I hope your trip was successful. You are not being help captive by these ... this group are you?" asks the silver droid.
SBC tilts his head and reply's "No SBC-58 I am not a captive of this group. You spend too much time behind a computer console. They are possible allies to the cause and might serve the house well."
The silver droid pauses, possibly a trait of this line of protocol droids then continues. "You know protocol SBC-54 they must be processed first."
"Do not quote protocol to me SBC-58, I wrote much of it if you remember correctly. Yes I am sure the Captain will have many questions for them. I will report for debriefing, allow me to explain to our guests."

</details>

The chattering of beeps goes on for a moment before SBC-54 turns back to your group. Tar`ja and Kasga both strain to make out binary and keeping up with it as spoken by two of its natives are two different things. "Welcome to Port Eclipse." SBC-54 bows and continues. "Owned and operated by the house Runn and commanded by Captain Runn. You are our guests here but I must ask that you leave all weapons on the ship. You will have no need of them here, and they will be safe on board. Our escorts will accompany you to a waiting room. My apologizes, but you each must submit to questioning."
The droid pauses again, a trait of its programing of an effort to allow the recent news to sink in you are not sure. "My employer is a member of the rebellion, and as you can imagine precautions must be taken. I assure you no harm will come to you while you are a guest." SBC-54 motions with one hand to the ramp "After you."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-06-22 14:59:40)

Tar'ja frowns at the exchange between the droids, keeping up with binary was always a tad difficult if you were out of practice, which she slightly was. She managed to get most of it though or at least the basic idea of it.
"Owned and operated by the house Runn and commanded by Captain Runn. You are our guests here but I must ask that you leave all weapons on the ship. You will have no need of them here, and they will be safe on board. Our escorts will accompany you to a waiting room. My apologizes, but you each must submit to questioning."
A new frown mars her features "you want us to leave unarmed?" She eyes the others "no offense meant to you SBC but considering what had happened the last time we should have been able to trust someone enough to get us off this rock, disabled you and called the imperials. Thanks but I'll be keeping my blaster."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-06-22 17:54:42)

"My employer is a member of the rebellion, and as you can imagine precautions must be taken. I assure you no harm will come to you while you are a guest." Chase listened to SBC as it gave them the run down of how things were going to happen. They were going to have to leave their weapons on board the ship.
As SBC finished talking chase had already sent his focus out beyond the hull of the ship. His eyes closed briefly if anyone was looking at him and for a quick moment he simply looked at Tar'ja. His focus came easy as he reached out with the Force. He sensed the ones that were with the reception party as well as others within the hanger bay. Pushing farther he senses a growing number of beings located here on *Port Eclipse.* He was surprised at the amount of beings that were here. Shifting his focus slightly to pick up any feelings that would set off alarms for him he found none. No danger or deception could be felt.
Near him he heard Tar'ja talk to SBC stating that she was not going unarmed. He could understand that as he didn't want to go unarmed either. Maybe it was time to take that leap.
"You are not ready."
The voice startled him nearly broke his concentration. The voice was unfamiliar but it was coming from somewhere from within *Port Eclipse.* He placed a hand on the bulkhead, not to steady himself. His use of the Force must had alerted the other to his presence.
***Wait. Not ready for what?*** He thought but the presence was already gone.
His eyes focused on Tar'ja again. He welcomed the beauty that filled his vision. Even though only a few seconds had passed it was enough to draw attention to himself. ***Another Jedi here on board? Maybe not a Jedi but someone attuned to the Force. But what did it mean, 'I wasn't ready.' Ready for what? Karking hell.*** He let out a breath as he waged a battle with his emotions and finally got them under control.
This type of communication hasn't happened since Master Garet died. He needed to find out who it was. It was then he remembered Tar'ja's words.
He removed his lightsaber and hooked its ring to his belt. He then removed the belt, re-hooked it and hung it near the door. He turned back to Tar'ja who had expressed her unwillingness to disarm.
**"I know you don't want to go unarmed. I understand that. Believe me I do. There are a lot of beings here more than I first figured. I can't find any trace of danger or deception among them."** He looked into her blue eyes and fell into them like he normally did. **"We need to find out whats going on. And if the only way we can do that is by leaving our weapons here I'll do it. It's not like we'll be totally defenseless."**
***Besides I would do all I could to keep you safe.*** He thought to himself. The look his eyes conveyed was one of seriousness.
**"If we don't go the whole trip here will have been for naught."**

### **zerah** (2010-06-22 18:07:18)

A flicker in her attention had her sights resting upon Chase as he rested his hand upon the hull of this ship, was he alright?? She moved to him to help him, but he was able to stand, what's more he...he unhooked his belt! and hung it of all things!
"I know you don't want to go unarmed. I understand that. Believe me I do. There are a lot of beings here more than I first figured. I can't find any trace of danger or deception among them." He stared to her eyes and she felt lost, drowning, that sense frightened her, though she'd be damned if she ever showed it....still her form straightened, eyes harden a moment in reflex to strange emotions to shut down..
no...no this was Chase, this was safe. She relaxed again as he spoke "We need to find out whats going on. And if the only way we can do that is by leaving our weapons here I'll do it. It's not like we'll be totally defenseless." He may have said it that way but his eyes said something else all together, I would protect you, was what she heard. "If we don't go the whole trip here will have been for naught."
Sighing at the sense he spoke, the twi'lek begrudingly removed her belt and hung it beside his, crossing her arms as she moved to stand beside him "Alright...fine...but if we get shot at I'm using SBC for a shield."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-06-22 18:24:50)

As he spoke he could sense her fight with her emotions. Emotions that dealt with him. What exactly he wasn't sure but he had a good idea. To be honest he felt a little ashamed that he had the ability to sense that while she did not. Almost as if he had an unfair advantage. To this point he hadn't taken advantage of that fact. He didn't want to. He cared too much for her to hurt her like that. At that moment he decided that he would tell her that he could sense strong emotions from people but it would have to wait.
He watched her sigh as she slowly removed her belt. It was as if she was leaving a part of her self behind. He understood that also as he look at his lightsaber remembering words of wisdom from Master Garet. 'This weapon is your life'.
He watched her cross her arms and move to stand beside him. "Alright...fine...but if we get shot at I'm using SBC for a shield."
He smiled. **"Deal. I'll be the one holding him up."** He looked at her again catching her eyes. **"Thanks."** He said as he gently bumped her shoulder with his.
Looking back at SBC he nodded. **"I guess we're ready."**
OOC: What about Reb. Will Deidra be following along as an NPC for now or will she be staying behind on the ship. I'm not sure how to deal with her atm. is she sleeping, should we go look for her. yadda yadda.

Dex undoes his gun belt and takes out his hold blaster from it's hiding place. He sets them by the engine area. He thinks about rehiring his holdout again but decides that maybe it is best to play this there way for the moment. "I feel some what naked without my hold out at least. Thing saved my life more then once. " He keeps ahold of his tools and security kit and data pad. "I hope our employer is a friendly one." he motions to SCB to lead the way. "Shall we?"

As your group disarms SBC-54 moves onto the ramp "This way please, follow me." The droid walks to the bottom of the ramp as he hits the hanger bay floor every rebel guard salutes the droid. Paying no attention to them SBC-54 moves towards the hanger bay double doors. "We will try to make this as fast as possible, you will each meet with members of the rebellion to assess your possible interest in becoming a member and your possible introduction into the rebellion.
SBC-54 looks over to SBC-58 then speaks in more binary coding the native language of the droids.
**For Kasaga and Tar`ja only**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"The imperial officer is inside. She is sedated and harmless for now. See too it that she is comfortable before questioning. I will debrief on her actions first ... it may clear her of the charges."
SBC-58 nods "I will see to it personally."

</details>

SBC054 nods to your group "You must be hungry for some real food, follow me I will have an aid take your meal orders." The droid then bows as he awaits your group to follow.
**For Deidra only**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

After some time in the common room in hyper space and a week of the same dried ration meals you settle in for a long nights sleep. When you head hits the pillow you enter slumber right away, much faster then normal ... no dreams tonight.
When you awake you find yourself inside a white padded room. Is this a dream? A nightmare? Pinching yourself it is real, you are not on the ship and judging from your slightly blurred vision you and the huge headache you must have been drugged.

<strong>Once again it seems the comfort of the frying pan is insufficient and the fire seems far more comfortable - ?</strong>
The mention of Trandosians sent a crawl up Naryens spine. She adjusted to something more attentive, in part out of respect for Yogis tone, but mostly because spinal shivers are rather uncomfortable when slouching. She recalled her part in the Kashyyk ... incident ***So, they are well known slavers.*** She felt even more stupid before she corrected, recalling that her access to information was very limited. Still. With no small amount of guilt Naryen was successful, mostly, in keeping the bitter expression from her face.
Dexter was likely asleep, at this point, but he seemed less concerned with personal histories than the present moment. She found herself envious. Kasga's quick recount of how he found himself with this group was brief and, as expected, almost business-like. His opinion of the Tatooine cell left a residue of dread in her gut as she recalled the young faces she left behind there. Especially one in particular. She wrestled her imagination down before the images of Laelahs death went too far.
Naryen felt confused about the stories. She was, for some reason, expecting more. Now, however, it fell to her.
She sighed, and looked down at hands she hadn't realized she had clenched so tightly but reflected that it must have been at mention of the Trandodsians. With effort, she unclenched and stretched her fingers across the table. With a shuddering breath, which revealed more than she wanted, she began. ***"My turn then."*** She readied herself, with visible effort.
**"I am one of the few remaining Varbrindi. Then senator Palpatine came to my people with the promise of change and we were swept up in the energy of those promises. Our economy, and therefore our political standing in the senate, was struggling before the creation of the Empire, but upon its inception we became its brilliant centerpiece. The products of our universities, from our Marines to our Officers we were celebrated. Even the products of our ship-yards were widely prized."
"My first full tour was the Kashyyk Quarantine, or so it was filed for our reference. A contagion had started spreading and the residents were falling ill to the hallucinogenic and psychotic effects, or so we were told. Riots. Mass killings. Trandosian *experts* were called in to assist with processing to make sure that the entire population wouldn't fall to it. I was attached to security, at first, because of evidence that it was released intentionally by terrorists to show that the new Empire was impotent to protect its citizens and they were still on the planet to ensure it's effects. The situation became dire rapidly & I was reassigned to the containment efforts."**
She sighed **"All lies, of course. The ferocity of their fight for their freedom, not because of any biological weapon, and the Trandosioans were there to round slaves."** She looked up, from her hands, tears forming, to each there with her. **"Lies, like so much we've been told and those lies haunt me like the screams of their children and ours."**
She looked back down to her hands **"From there I was assigned to the Adjudicator, following Captain Prewarts orders was the first time that things felt, almost right. But that too went according to an agenda kept from us. We were told Varbrindal, my home, was being attacked. Shortly after I was deployed to assist with crowd control the Illustrious was attacked, we lost contact. Without central control the general population became panicked. Troopers began to do the same, but they had the weapons."**
The pause was thick, her eyes widened, and her hands began to shake. **"Then Admiral Saycho conveyed orders from the Emperor and my people were killed."** She looked up, right at Chases face. **"Millions. Shot dead. Perhaps more."**
Back to her hands, **"I escaped in the Star of Cerea, packed well beyond specs."** she recalls teh screams as the ship came under fire when the reached Tatooine. **"but Admiral Saycho was already at Tatooine to greet us. I'm confident that only Laehla and myself survived. Those ships that escaped Varbrindal were likely all tracked intercepted. The Emperor, or someone else in the Empire, wanted no witnesses to the Varbrindi massacre left alive."**
**"I'm sorry, I really am tired. Dexter has the bounty on me, it was enough to make the Gran wide eyed when he realized who I was. I'm sure the story there is more colorful that I can tell it"** The viscous sarcasm there surprised her. She chuckled. **"I'll have to read it soon myself!"** She turned in with the rest, though sleep was fleeting and the nightmares frequent.
Her feeling of security that allowed the revelations to be shared with her traveling companions, seemed to diminish as the days went on. Perhaps she was nervous about how she'd be judged by the people they were about to meet. A couple of days later she pulled Dexter aside **"Pull up my bounty on the pad you got form the Gran, please. I feel up for some light reading!"** the chuckle was not heart-felt and it showed but she rallied herself with a smile to her light-hearted and hairy friend.
(( *reads Trus post, picks up his jaw from the floor, and deletes the remaining 2/3 of his post (really!)* Hey, I worked hard on that!!... and neat!! *nearly giggles* ))
She read the file when she retired for the night and realized that her choice of bedtime reading may not have been the best. Her feelings seemed oddly slanted though she surrendered to sleep far too quickly to give it further thought.
She awoke with her universe feeling rather ... vague. As her sense returned she decided that the word, fuzzy seemed to fit. It was then that her mind erupted. Panic surged and transmuted into a fierce clarity as her adrenaline surged through her mind. ***Sedated!*** Naryens body was very sluggish to respond which magnified her mental reactions all the more. Quickly, though, her feeling of panic was replaced by the calm, calculating, responses she had come to rely on over the years. ***It's what I'd have done. Nicely played SBC.*** She crosses her hands and her ankles, waiting for her warden to reveal themselves and suspecting that her vitals are being monitored, and waiting for more of the effects of the drugs to diminish before she stands.
After a few minutes of that she pulls herself, slowly, to a seated position and looks around. The effort causes her skull to decide that it's 2 sizes too small and her face twists from the pain as the room decides to abandon it's choice of "up" and try on several other directions to suit it's flighty mood. **"Didn't want to waste the good stuff on a former Imperial huh?"** she says to no one in particular. Her eyes widen at the shock of the words that spill from her. ***Well that was awfully brazen of you… you idiot!*** She holds her head in one had and looks around the room. ***Relax before they decide your mouth isn't worth the trouble!***
Naryen slowly moves over to a corner to sit against and hold her head up. With closed eyes, but an exhausted but somewhat amused expression, she waits to see if her warden will reveal themselves before or after the room decides to stop arguing with itself over its choice of vertical. She resists the urge to twiddle her thumbs or start humming to herself. ***My aren't we a brat today!***
(( OOC- Sorry for the delay guys. I'll post everything here, and sorry again this is rushed. I figure better this than to delay further. ))

Tar'ja follows the droid at Chase's side, arms crossed as she was still in a bit of a pouting mood for leaving her blaster on the ship. The droids began to talk again, bunch of robotic hens those to.
Wait...what did he say? Imperial? Her eyes narrow as she looks over to Kasga and back again "What did you do with Deidra.." she asks softly, that deathly calm that spoke of having them both laying on a table with their inner cables exposed.
She looks up to Chase "He's sedated her to keep her 'harmless' and they're planning to take her somewhere." She repeats for his benefit, her gaze returns to the droid "SBC, where the hell did you take our friend and team member, she was harmless already, she would have followed your orders and wouldn't have hurt a person on this flying tub without due cause!" She looks around before beginning to veer off to follow the other droid and find their friend, amazing how the woman had gone from woman to friend in such a short time "I'm going to get her back."

SBC continued on speaking about meeting that would take place between them and members of the Rebellion. To be honest he wanted to get this over with. The cloak and dagger stuff really wasn't his thing. The quicker it was all out on the table the better.
The two droids conversed again as he looked around in an attempt to get a view of things. "You must be hungry for some real food, follow me I will have an aid take your meal orders." Chase nodded in agreement but stopped quickly. He had felt a shift in mood from Tar'ja. It was something serious.
"What did you do with Deidra..." He heard Tar'ja say in that cool tone that spoke volumes. He half turned and looked back up into the ship. Not seeing Deidra finally made him realize that she was there with them. ***Good job Chase leave a friend behind.*** He chided himself.
"He's sedated her to keep her 'harmless' and they're planning to take her somewhere. SBC, where the hell did you take our friend and team member, she was harmless already, she would have followed your orders and wouldn't have hurt a person on this flying tub without due cause!" The expression on his face was clear. He wasn't happy.
He looked at SBC. **"Is this true? What has she done to cast the suspicion over you? You have been with us for the past week you have seen that we trust her with our lives."** He paused for a quick second gathering his thoughts. **"And if your intelligence network on Tatooine is as good as you say it is, you already know what happened back in the cantina and from that you know what I am."** He was referring to the fight where he used his lightsaber. **"If I trust her, a former Imperial, then surely you can as well and not be as cautious. This does not need to happen this way. Now you have put us on the defensive instead of at ease like you wanted."**
As he spoke her heard Tar'ja say she was going to find her. Chase didn't understand the language that the two droids spoke. Right now he wished he did. He wasn't going to try and stop Tar'ja. He knew her well enough now that if she set her mind to something she was going to do it.

"So we are to be questioned and judged then." Dex smiles. "Reminds me of being back in the academy. They could give a proper grilling, they could." Dex was not really concerned to much about the questioning part. As far as he knew there was nothing to fear cause he had nothing to hide. Mostly. "So I guess if we just willingly said we wanted to help that would not be enuff?"
As Dex followed the others something was happening. Something had happened to one of them. Chase and Tarja where moving away from the others following two different droids. Dex turns to SBC. "This your idea oh "No Harm."?! She has done nothing to you or anyone here! Bring her back or trust me there will be trouble!" This was the first time Dex had showed a side of himself few had seen. The fur on the back of his neck raising. " Explain yourself droid. Where are they taking her?"

### **galenbd** (2010-06-26 21:09:38)

Kasga is much amused by the debate between Tar'ja and Chase regarding weapons. They will not allow us to be a threat. Weapons are significantly superfulous. The moment we elected to perform the bidding of SBC-54, it was inevitable we would end up in this prison. We are potential recruits, of infiltrators.
He lets the ramp down and SBC-54 descends. From the salutes, the droid is held in very high esteem here. Not that I could tell from his performance on Tantooine.
SBC-54 discusses having sedated Deirdra as they descend the ramp. There's another debate between Chase and Tar'ja about this. Morality has it's place in war, however, reality is that they hold sufficient force to commit any action they care to. Back to the original meeting with SBC-54.
Kasga remarks, **"She may be a defector, or a clever plant. Her actions have been worthy, but possibly designed to cultivate that trust. Infiltration and counter-intellegence are necessary in war. Chase, you need to recognize your word has no worth to these people."**
He turns toward Dexter and continues, **"We are to be judged as all are who seek to rise over their current level of incompetence. They need to determine how much to trust us with. From the time of the meeting in the cantina, we could no longer walk away. They may be able to give us, Deidra included, more responsibility, but until we are judged, they will not know. "**

The door to the hanger bay closes behind you as you continue walking. Hearing the concern your group has for a fellow member SBC-54 stops. Turning back to your group SBC states "None of you will be hurt. You have not been betrayed Tar`ja."
For Chases eyes only
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"Listen to the metal one you should." again the voice.

</details>

"What Kasga says is true. Would you do any different in our place. No I think not, too much at stake too many lives." SBC-54 heads down the corridor again. Throughout this area of the corridor civilians of multiple races come and go. Some huddle to the side or in corners, while others hurry through daily chores. Many look like refugees possible survivors of some random battle on some unknown world.
For Chases eyes only
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"We mean you no harm." The voice at first you mistake it for your old master, but only for a second. Surprised the first time you heard, felt the presence it was easy to mistake. But now you understand this is a woman reaching out to you, yet closing you off at the same time.

</details>

SBC-54 continues "This way please, I assure you we mean no harm. We are the good guys and even if we find your associate guilty we will not harm her." SBC-54 leads you through several corridors and up a few levels as well. The scene remains the same huddled refugees, the odd rebel guard from time to time and a lot of droids. Many of the droids are old B-1 models left overs of the clone wars.
SBC-54 stops opening a double doorway to an empty room. Inside the room is dominated by a large table surrounded by chairs, a board room of some kind. This the sides of the room are dual refreshers and a bunk room. The far wall of the room is engulfed in port windows.
Outside the swirling mix of gasses and light set off a wonderful haze across space. a random ship or service droid passes by the window but it does little to ruin the view. "Please make yourselves comfortable." A B-1 droid moves past SBC-54. "Give the service droid any requests you might have, we will have to debrief your group one at a time. I myself must report for such debriefing."
SBC-54 leaves the double door closing behind him. The B-1 stands motionless for a moment the states. "Could I get you anything. The droid stands staring off int the middle of the room at no one in particular.
For Deidra`s eyes only
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

You wait inside the room for some time. Minutes hours seems like days. You begin to wonder is this to be my cell my prison, my ending.
The sound of the door opening with a loud thump brings you back to your senses. Flickering your eyes open you see two burly men reach inside picking you up by the arms and dragging you out. The changing light almost blinds you as you force your eyes to adjust.
The two men carry your full weight dragging you feet on the ground. Then you are sitting in a chair inside a dimly lite room with a single light pointed in your face. You can not make it out but you think there are two others in the room with you.
One a male begins. "State your name, and reason for being here."
As if unable to play out the scene a woman blurts in "Lt Naryen Fae, of the Adjudicator. Reporting to Captain Prewart directly then to Admiral Saycho. You served a tour of duty on Kashyyk where you assisted in the enslavement of thousands of innocents." The woman continues to read off your service record, her voice is shaking as she speaks. Anger even rage as she lists off where you are from, what imperial schools you attended even some of your final marks.
Finally the woman stops and says "How do you plead for your crimes?"

Tar'ja was furious, she may have followed the others but she was furious. How dare they...so what if she had done some terrible things in the past, she had been told it was for different things, things that were supposed to make a difference in the galaxy, she could understand that, she had no reason to question anything they did! and she was being charged for the crimes of the Empire!
The droid left and the other stayed but the twi'lek was pacing back and forth "How dare they....what crimes did she personally do to warrent anything but be near those that have fought along side of her!" Turning pale eyes to the others she shakes her head "This isn't right, we should be there to defend her!"
The twi'lek continued to pace, passing the B-1 droid and back to the window then back again, she was tense, and she wasn't sure of a proper plan, would it be better to wait and hope or to go shadow walking to find her?
"Dammit." she mutters and moves past the droid again this time intent to leave "I'm going to find her."

### **Yogi** (2010-06-28 12:42:12)

They weren't given the option of going after Deidra as they were ushered along. As the hanger doors closed behind them Chase had a feeling of being cut off. The ship, while it wasn't much was their only way off this station. Now they were cut off from it, weaponless.
SBC stopped in front of then and turned. They had all voiced their concerns for Deidra and Chase wondered what the droid would say. "None of you will be hurt. You have not been betrayed Tar`ja."
It did little to settle his mind on the matter. ***I wonder what it would think…*** He began to think to himself till he was cut off.
*"Listen to the metal one you should."* The voice said again and this time he looked around in a vain attempt to see the owner of the voice.
SBC continued, "What Kasga says is true. Would you do any different in our place. No I think not, too much at stake too many lives." It began to walk to its destination.
The Jedi made a face. Despite his feelings on the situation he had to agree with Kasga and SBC. Though he didn't have to like it. Next to him he could feel the emotions from Tar'ja. It was easiest and safest to say that she wasn't happy with the situation. He reached out and gently held her hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze before letting go. **"It will be alright. There's other things going on here."** He said trying to reassure her. He didn't explain what he meant but took it for granted that she would understand it had something to do with the Force.
What he saw on the walk surprised him. While he expected to see military personnel he wasn't prepared for all the civilians. Many looked like refugees. It didn't matter from where or what battle. The war had put them here among others. In a safe place? He wasn't sure yet. Still he had no feelings of distrust or malice towards them.
*"We mean you no harm."* Again the voice comes to him. Familiar somehow.
***Master Garet?*** He answers back but as he does so he realizes the voice is not from his old Master. Reaching out he focuses on the person. ***No not Master Garet but someone else. A woman. Interesting.*** He took a deep breath. He needed to tell the others about this but not here in the open. ***Most likely your room will be bugged Chase so does it really matter?*** He thought.
"This way please, I assure you we mean no harm. We are the good guys and even if we find your associate guilty we will not harm her." The voice of SBC made him look at the droid. The view continues to remain the same even on the new level they were now on.
Several more corridors and they arrived at the room. Upon entering Chase saw that it was dominated by a large table. He didn't pay SBC much attention as it left and the other droid took over asking about getting them anything. He looked at the others and Tar'ja in particular as she paced the room. He could feel the emotions rise in her, almost broadcasting out for those that could feel them. ***You have to control your emotions Tar'ja. They can cloud your judgment.*** He laughed inwardly as he remembered hearing almost the same words from Garet in what seemed like ages ago. Yet it was those emotions were one of the things he like about her so much.
"How dare they....what crimes did she personally do to warrant anything but be near those that have fought along side of her!" She looked at them and he saw her eyes linger upon him a second longer than the others. "This isn't right, we should be there to defend her!"
**"Tar'ja."** He said to her but before he could continue she cut him off.
"Dammit." She muttered as she broke for the door. "I'm going to find her."
Taking several quick steps he reached her side. **"Tar'ja, hold on for a minute. Please."** He looked at he others and then looked at her. Those blue eyes holding his. **"Look there's more going on here than you know. I've felt another presence in the Force here on the station. Familiar somehow. At first I thought it was Garet but then I realized it was from a woman. She said that they meant us no harm. I know its hard for all of you to understand what I'm saying but I haven't felt any malice or distrust from any that we've seen so far. Even from those I can't see but can only feel."**
He sighed. took a second and reached out for Deidra. He felt her presence and knew that she was still on the station. He wasn't sure where. From what he could tell she was still alright.
They were in a tough position. **"I can feel Deidra. She's still here on the station. from what I can tell she's still alright."**  He saw the look in her eyes searching his. **"Look I know how you feel. I can feel your emotions radiating off you like a sun going super nova. I'm trying not to invade on your privacy but its sometimes hard when the emotions are very strong ones."** He stopped for a second and lowered his voice a bit as a tone of vulnerability entered his voice. **"It especially hard due to my own emotional attachment…"** He paused, **"…to you."**
**"I know I can't make you stay but Kasga was right. We would have done the same thing. They could have thrown us all in a cell. The fact they didn't tells me a lot."**
He looked at her the lilac coloring of her skin shown brighter in the rooms lights as did her eyes. It was then that his words seconds before resonated within him. ***Its happened Chase you did exactly what Garet told you to be careful about.***

Kasga follows SBC-54 down to the meeting room. He leans against the wall casually and prepares for a long wait. Tar'ja can't seem to settle. Definitely not military. She makes her decision and heads for the door. Chase tries to convince her to stand down.
Kasga raises his voice to carry through the room, **"Tar'ja, you will not succeed if you go after her. We are out-manned and out-gunned. If you really feel she is being treated unfairly, I suggest a strategic withdrawl. Then you can return with a larger force.**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-06-28 13:24:29)

"Tar'ja, hold on for a minute. Please." She paused and looked back to him, why did he always make her take pause when she had made up her mind.."Look there's more going on here than you know. I've felt another presence in the Force here on the station. Familiar somehow. At first I thought it was Garet but then I realized it was from a woman. She said that they meant us no harm. I know its hard for all of you to understand what I'm saying but I haven't felt any malice or distrust from any that we've seen so far. Even from those I can't see but can only feel."
A frown marrs her features, there was another one of him? and a female at that? she wasn't entirely sure of emotions and such yet but she was fairly sure this unsettling feeling going on in her was probably jealousy...and the rising urge to find and maim this unknown female was not so much startling as something that needed to be pushed to the side.
"I can feel Deidra. She's still here on the station. from what I can tell she's still alright." Her eyes widdened briefly then narrowed as she searched his eyes, he could feel her? even if she was alright.."Look I know how you feel. I can feel your emotions radiating off you like a sun going super nova. I'm trying not to invade on your privacy but its sometimes hard when the emotions are very strong ones."
He could....
"It especially hard due to my own emotional attachment...to you."
She was flushing, her eyes were wide and she knew she was blushing, he could feel her emotions...she supposed to anyone else this would have been something huge and worthy of yelling and berating at a lack of privacy, but it may have been her upbringing or just him, but she didn't feel that...only an embarrassment that she couldn't hide the emotions she couldn't name from him. However, that could work to an advantage, she could start learning some of the weird ones.
"I know I can't make you stay but Kasga was right. We would have done the same thing. They could have thrown us all in a cell. The fact they didn't tells me a lot." Right...back to what was going on...
She shakes her head and frowns "I would rather be in a cell with her and be able to get her out than sit by and do nothing." She looks over to Kasga "She is a comrade, and she has done nothing or personal attack to the galaxy." Looking back to the Jedi she shakes her head "I'm going to find her, I'm going to get her back or help her to plead her case."
taking a step to the door again she keeps watching the Jedi "You can stay, but I would think any comrade would do this for their own. And she would do it for us." at least...that's how she viewed it. Turning to the other male she narrows her eyes at him "You may leave a fellow to the rancors but I do not." She turned then and moved to leave, she was going to find her.

Dex listens to all of his friends talk about what would happen to Deidra. If she had committed some crime in the past, they had better all take a good look at themselves cause what everyone was doing now was a crime by the law that was in power now. Turning back to there droid host. "Your word then No harm? If you are the good guys here then I would think you would trust us when we say this action was not necessary. She would have caused no trouble at all. if was a security risk she would have done something on the trip here." Dex realizes that they where not going to get anywhere with there Hosts holding all the cards. "Ok, I guess we have to play along. We can try to find out more later on in when we meet our Host." Dex decides that now he needed to do his job and figure out all he could from supposed new friends.

"Tar'ja, you will not succeed if you go after her. We are out-manned and out-gunned. If you really feel she is being treated unfairly, I suggest a strategic withdrawal. Then you can return with a larger force." Kasga said from his position. He closed his eyes at the pilots words. ***Karking hell Kasga that certainly wont help or keep her here.*** He could feel the conflicting emotions within her. What he had told her took hold and she understood what he had meant.
Still looking at Tar'ja he spoke up. **"And where do you propose we get this larger force Kasga? Are you prepared to leave this station without her? You said so yourself we're out-manned and out-gunned. Would we even make it to the ship? "**
Chase knew the answer to his last question. They wouldn't. Even if they had their weapons.
He listened to Tar'ja as she wrestled with what to do. No that was wrong she had already made up her mind. She was going and proved it as she started towards the door. She kept watching him. "You can stay, but I would think any comrade would do this for their own. And she would do it for us." He sighed. Not because she was wrong but he knew that she was right. Deidra would do the same as she but maybe with a little less emotion. Her parting words to Kasga were final describing her intent. He looked at the Duros and then to the droid who was probably listening, recording and broadcasting it to it owners.
***Sithspit.*** He stood there for a moment as she walked to the door. His own emotions were conflicted and it was a battle that waged within him. He wanted to go with her to show his support for her and their friend. Yet he already knew that no harm would come to them that much the Force had told him. That and the woman.
He walked to her. **Tar'ja, we don't even know if we can get out. There could be guards on the other side. Armed most likely. The droid here in the room."** He jerked his thumb in its direction. **"Has heard everything we have said. probably recorded it and is probably transmitting it to whoever it reports to."**
He looked away from her towards the door and reached out beyond it with his ability. He tried to do it with out throwing all his ability into it. He was sure that if he put a great effort into it the woman who contacted him though the Force would feel it. Beyond the door he felt many presences. Weather they were right outside the door or past it in the hallway he couldn't be sure but there was someone outside.
**"Alright Tar'ja I'll help how ever I can. But listen there are many presences outside the door and in the hallway. The hallway was pretty well lit as I remember which won't allow for you to hide. As far as me being sneaky I might as well be a Wookie stomping down the halls."**
He looked back at her the determination was still there. **"Any ideas?"**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-06-29 12:36:29)

Tar'ja frowns, he had said they wouldn't be harmed, but that may not apply to an ex-Imperial! how could they not understand that their safety didn't mean that hers was.
She listened though, glad that the Jedi was on her side and willing to help her go after their friend.
"Alright Tar'ja I'll help how ever I can. But listen there are many presences outside the door and in the hallway. The hallway was pretty well lit as I remember which won't allow for you to hide. As far as me being sneaky I might as well be a Wookie stomping down the halls."
She narrows her eyes in thought, limited shadows, a person that couldn't be sneaky...well...as far as anyone would be concerned they were placed in here and if they left then they would have been debriefed...
"Well..the only ones that would prove troublesome..is that droid..and the persons outside." She looks over to him, leaning in to whisper "as far as anyone else would know, if we walk as though we know we belong here no one will suspect we haven't been debriefed yet." She eyes him "You can act casually can't you?" She smirks faintly "just have to quietly and easily take out those outside the door..knock them out maybe, and then we'd be fine."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2010-06-29 13:14:49)

Dex looks around the room. SBC-54 had left to report to his master and the B-1 was left to attend to there needs. No Holo gear. No comm gear that he could see. He trues to the B-1."Yes my good droid. I was wondering if I could have some refreshment and food for me and my friends. Also is there anything that could pass the time? The view is nice but might need something else." Dex realizes that the droid has probably been instructed to not allow them to communication with the outside. Maybe he could come up with something while the droid was gone.

Chase looked over to Kasga and Dexter. The former was still leaning against the wall as Dexter of all things was ordering food. Couldn't he hear the conversation that was going on. It was becoming clear that Dex may be becoming more of an asset he was also off in his own world and that made him a liability.
He looks back to Tar'ja. All he had said so far in an attempt to turn her away from leaving hadn't worked. He didn't lie to her as he was prepared to go with her out of the room. Question is where would they go once or if they got out.
**"Knock a few people out and continue on."** He repeated basically what she said. **"Ok where do we go from there? We have no idea where the detention center would be. The longer we wander the greater the chance of getting caught is. Think about it Tar'ja were running on emotions and not with a plan. Without some sort of plan the chances of getting caught increases. I'm prepared to go with you but right now I think it will be very difficult. Like I said I feel no deception from them."** He said as he moved closer to the door

tar'ja shakes her head "I don't know where they are that's true, but I know we need to try something, I can't just sit here and think about what they're doing to her for things the Empire has done!"
She shakes her head and looks back to the door "What would you have us do then? sit here and hope that she'll be okay? wait and eat while she has had nothing? we don't know what they're doing, they could be torturing her because of what she was!"

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-06-29 17:20:43)

He watched her as thoughts ran through her head. What he wanted to do was just go to her and hold her tight.
"I don't know where they are that's true, but I know we need to try something, I can't just sit here and think about what they're doing to her for things the Empire has done!" She was emotional more so than he had ever seen her. He watches as she shakes her head causing her lekku to shake back and forth also. Her gaze comes to rest on the door.
"What would you have us do then? sit here and hope that she'll be okay? Wait and eat while she has had nothing? We don't know what they're doing, they could be torturing her because of what she was!"
He took a step towards her. Slowly he reached out for her hands. **"Look I don't have all the answers I'll be the first to admit it But I do know a few things. First SBC said that even if they did find her guilty no harm would come to her. Second, while I could not locate her I felt no distress from her, no pain."** He was grasping a bit on the last one. If she was in any pain he was pretty sure he would have felt it.
He looked in her eyes. **"And three, If they do hurt her we'll get our weapons back and then they will have to deal with us and that's something they will not want to deal with."** he looked at the droid that was taking the order from Dexter and he shook his head. **"I want to make sure that she is alright too. I can try to locate her again through the Force and get a sense of her emotions."**
As he looked at her the feeling of wanting to hold her again came back. Something to at least provider her with just a little more strength.

### **zerah** (2010-06-29 17:31:24)

Tar'ja was at war with herself, she could hear her 'father' yelling at her for letting emotions run past a careful wall, and yelling at her for wanting to rush off without a proper plan of attack, but at the same time she didn't care; she felt too tight, like her body would just snap at any moment...she didn't like that feeling..and she didn't know what it was.
Turning to him as warmth surrounded her hands, lekku twitching erratically, "Look I don't have all the answers I'll be the first to admit it But I do know a few things. First SBC said that even if they did find her guilty no harm would come to her. Second, while I could not locate her I felt no distress from her, no pain."
no pain...he had no reason to lie to her save to get her to calm down...but..well..that force thing, if he could sense her emotions then he could sence Deidra's...
"And three, If they do hurt her we'll get our weapons back and then they will have to deal with us and that's something they will not want to deal with. I want to make sure that she is alright too. I can try to locate her again through the Force and get a sense of her emotions."
That...might help... She nods her head, trying to calm her nerves down "yes...please." She remembered a long time ago during a practice run of sneaking seeing to people in an argument, it was heated and the female had looked ready to hit something but the other just hugged her, and she calmed. That strange reaction was something fascinating. Pulling her hands from him she wrapped her arms around herself, something she had taken to doing if her emotions ran apart or she felt too tense in an effort to calm down since seeing those two.

### **Yogi** (2010-06-29 22:51:50)

Chase watched her. He could almost imagine the thought process that must be going on in her head. Then again he didn't have the childhood she had. A lot of the emotions she's been experiencing seemed almost new to her. With out even trying he could sense the terrible storm of emotions that she was experiencing. He withdrew his presence as best he could. With the effort he was able to not be bombarded as badly by her runaway emotions.
"Yes...please." She answered his question on trying to reach out to Deidra. Slowly she pulled her hands away. He was surprised to see her hug herself. He watched her for a second somewhat now detached from her emotions since he withdrew his presence a moment ago. Here was a strong woman in front of him who right now had been reduced to hugging herself because of what she was feeling. It was at that moment he realized what Deidra had meant to her, a friend. Sister maybe. ***I can't imagine her having many friends when she was growing up. Only this 'family' she spoke about who are now all dead. What did they do to bring that kind of wrath down upon them?*** He thought to himself.
**"Tar'ja."** He said to her though her head remained looking down. He took a step closer. They were only about a foot apart now. **"Tar'ja."** He said again this time he lifted a hand and used a finger to raise her head gently by her chin. He looked her in the eyes as he smiled at her. **"It will be ok."** He stepped a bit closer as he raised up his other arm as it slowly encircled her. The hand that was at her chin went past her shoulder and he gently and slowly drew her into an embrace and held her. She was stiff at first but he felt her relax as she placed her head on his shoulder.
He didn't say anymore he just simply stood there holding and comforting her and let her decide when enough was enough. He took a deep breath and let his own nerves escape.

Tar'ja's mind was flooded, in one ear she could hear the yelling in the other she could hear this sort of strange high pitched tone...she wasn't sure what that was but both were making her feel as though she were a child again, back at learning...
"Tar'ja" *"Tar'ja! what's the matter with you! are you crying!? there is no crying here! you have no emotions! how many times have I told you that?! Do I need to get the belt again or are you going to behave like a proper shadow?"
"I'll behave…I..I won't cry anymore..please don't get the belt.."
"There, that's better…but for this you have to be punished still, get your chain and go to your corner."
"Yes Father…"*
"Tar'ja"
Her mind snapped back to the present suddenly very aware that he had moved much closer, but it wasn't the demon in her mind, it was Chase..at least that was some relief.
"It will be ok."
He wrapped an arm around her the other had lifted her head to look at him; her eyes were wide, distant while still fighting to return. At this...strange thing of arms wrapping around..that thing she saw the two fighting people do, she tensed. What was it?? was it going to be painful? was it a trick? *It's Chase…he's not going to hurt you…*
Inner voice...that thing inside that seemed to have the answers even if everything else was unknown. She relaxed, rested her head to his shoulder and let her eyes close, her arms unwound around herself to wrap around him loosely, unsure of how this was supposed to work with another person.
She never had friends before...the idea of loosing one was..painful.

He felt her undo her arms that were wrapped around herself. Slowly they came up to loosely wrap around him. Together they stood there for a moment. He held her a little tighter hoping that he was adding a little bit of security to the embrace. When she didn't respond in kind he moved his head slightly so he could talk quietly in her ear.
**"It's ok to squeeze tighter Tar'ja. That's one of the things a hug is between two people who care for each other. A sense of safety in knowing that someone is there for you."** His right hand gently rubbed her back as he spoke. **"Haven't you ever been hugged before."** He said softly. It was nice to hold her close. It seemed like an odd time but it felt like maybe some of the walls she had placed to protect herself were coming down slowly.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-06-30 11:11:49)

His arms were getting tired, why? what was that supposed to do? was it all a trick? everything? was he-"It's ok to squeeze tighter Tar'ja. That's one of the things a hug is between two people who care for each other. A sense of safety in knowing that someone is there for you."
Oh...it's...it's normal than?
Her arms moved slowly, still very unsure of this...hug...thing.. But she did hug him tighter, he was right..it felt like a sense of security around her, she hugged a little more; so this is what those people had done...they were hugging...hugs were kinda nice..
"Haven't you ever been hugged before."
She shakes her head, even if she had at one time..it was before she had come to the 'family' and by then...she didn't remember anything. A hug...she liked hugs.
"I like hugs..." she mumbles softly, resting her head still against his shoulder, hiding her face in his neck, this was nice...but how much did someone have to care for another to initiate a hug?
"How...how much is a person to care for another to initiate a hug? What if you don't like them that much when they do?" She asked softly, part of her felt silly for asking something that it seemed was so common for him, the other part...well...that felt like some childhood curiosity that had held on and hid.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-06-30 12:30:32)

He felt her arms tighten around him as she answered his question. He was actually surprised at the answer. He imagined that her life before was difficult but he didn't realize it was quite like this.
"I like hugs..." She mumbled softly. A smile spread across his face as her head still rested on his shoulder, her face nuzzled into his neck.
"How...how much is a person to care for another to initiate a hug? What if you don't like them that much when they do?" Her question made him think for a second.
**"Well that depends. It mostly comes down to a level of comfort with the other person and the situation but all hugs aren't like this. They can be quick, over and done with in just a few seconds. Most importantly it's up to you if you let someone in close."**
He kissed her softly on the cheek and whispered into her ear. **"And just so you know…I like hugs too."** He sighed as he held her. To be honest he felt like a teen again even though those years weren't far behind him. It was her that was making him feel like this. Garet always warned him of strong emotions and if these weren't strong emotions he didn't know what was. ***How could this be bad?*** He thought.
***It can't***

<strong> Tibble-ations? </strong>
The remains of the sedative linger, reminding Naryen of how tired she is. She relaxes in the corner and surrenders to a more restful, and thankfully, dreamless sleep.
Some time later two men, dressed in civilian clothing and each capable of lifting Naryen on his own, entered the cell. They pause for a moment as she wakes up. ***No restraints. Fine, I'll play.*** She accommodates them for a short trip into a room lit by a single, piercing light. ***Ow, fraking drugs!*** she wears the wince, directed at the light, plainly as she is seated in a simple, unpadded, chair. ***No clichéd elevated metal platform? Interesting.***
After the men leave she becomes aware of two others, in the room, that remain. She keeps her head low and her eyes closed so the light doesn't encourage the drill sergeants playing dueling artillery across her temples. The male voice she doesn't seem to recognize but the cracking of the female voice reveals much.
***Do you know someone that was 'led astray' because they were just 'following orders' or is it someone you knew you was on Kashyyk and remains there still?***
She finds herself wishing she could console her accuser.
Her lips part, dry and sore from their sunburn, and she speaks softly but firmly. **"I wish to answer but for me to know the accusation I must know my accuser."** firmer and with a bit of projection, **"Who are you to accuse me of the crime of surviving?"**
***That should cause them pause, at least, and perhaps we can actually communicate instead of this mock trial. Least I can do since I yet live. Please ask me to elaborate!*** She finds herself grabbing that thought with far more hope than she would have expected. This adds something a little puzzling to the mix.

She nods her head slowly, that made sense...hugs then were...something of intimate nature with some..and..forms of small affection with others...that made sense..
He kissed her cheek, that made her smile lightly, "And just so you know...I like hugs too." That..made her smile more, as though this was some secret thing she could share with him. She was learning a lot these days, she wondered if it was just that time to learn at last.
Her lekku move lightly as she sighs, pressing a kiss to his neck, not wanting to move from it; she was calming down finally.

Half listening to his friends and looking around the room they where in. Dex keeps his eye out for thing he needs to get some information. "I understand that you want to free Deidra. So do I but unless we can get the upper hand hear we have nothing. No weapons, no way to get to her, no idea where she is at all." He continues looking around the room. "Now you probably think I don't care about Deidra , I do. She is a friend and has proven herself to me and the rest of us. So if we can find access to there systems I may be able to give us more information on our host other then what they have told us. Information is power after all." Dex pulls out his Data pad and keeps looking for an access port, maintenance access anything that would get him what he needs.

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

At your little outburst both accusers do pause, you can hear the murmurs of their whispers but can only strain to make out what is being said. After a minute or so the male finally says "Just turn on the lights so we can finish this."
The lights go on again your fin yourself trying to adjust to the lighting conditions. Inside the room the two guards are no where to be seen left behind are your two accusers. The male a tall Cerean stands with his hand folded in front of him. His cone like head gives away his race, he is dressed in tan rebel officer clothes with the red rebel insignia worn proudly.
The woman a average height blond wears a similar uniform. Her hands are clenched in frustration, you notice a wetness near her eyes the same eyes that stare through you in obvious anger.
The Cerean bows "I am So-Maj. I have the rank of lieutenant in the alliance forces. Does that surprise you, we do not classify ourselves as a minor squad of rebels? My associate here is Lieutenant Elara Moraal of Varlbrindal."

</details>

The B-1 stares at your group waiting for direction. As your group converses about the matter at hand the B-1 waits. Dexter addressed the B-1 ordering food, refreshments and entertainment. The B-1 responds "Rodger Rodger."
Your group is still debating on the next move as the B-1 moves to the door. The door opens revealing the corridor beyond. Outside the room more refuges rest huddled within any available nook on the station. Two guards come into the door way flanking a slender Neimoidian.
Both guards are armed and attentive watching your groups movement. As they stand guard flanking the Neimodain they remain silent.
The Neimodain wheres a tan rebel officer uniform which sports the red rebel insignia. over his tan uniform he wears a long open brown robe. The man leans heavily on his one good leg as the other is a mechanical appendage.
After looking over your group, Chase and Tar`ja still in an embrace he speaks. "Welcome to Port Eclipse. I am Captain Runn of the house Runn. SBC-54 speaks highly of your group it is my pleasure to meet you all." Captain Runn bows "I am sure you have many questions for me, I will try to answer them for you."
Captain Runn walks into the room and sits at the head of the table. His guards continue to flank him. Captain Runn motions for you all to sit with an outstretched hand.

He felt her sigh as the tension seemed to leave her body. He patted her back affectionately as he held her wishing that he could do this for as long as it was needed but he knew that would not be the case. He felt the soft brush of her lips in the crook of his neck as she kissed him there. The effect was a shiver that ran down his spine. He smiled.
**"I like that too."** He said softly with a slight hint of laughter in his voice
He heard Dex talking in the background and what he said was right. They needed information before they could do anything like trying to get to Deidra.
He reached out gently to find Deidra. Easily he spread out his awareness across the station. He was surprised to find that the station was as large as it was. Multiple levels and sections housed thousands of beings. He was beginning to loose hope of finding her among the masses but when he was about to give up he sensed her. He couldn't tell where but he had the sense that she was alright. Stressed but alright.
**"I can sense Deidra. From what I can tell she alright. She's stressed pretty badly but she's ok."**
He heard the droid as it mved towards the door. If they were going to go this would have been the time but now they didn't need to that Tar'ja was now calmed. It was probably a good thing too as in addition to the refugees there were two guards in the hallway advanced into the doorway flanking a Neimodian.
The newcommer spoke announcing himself as Captain Runn and welcoming them to Port Eclipse while they still held eash other closly. **"Looks like we have company."** He said to her as he broke the embrace from Tar'ja and stood beside her facing the three that entered. He watched the two guards. they were both armed and alert keeping eyes on all four of them. ***Yes we do have questions for you.*** He thought.
He watched the Neimodian as he walked to the head of the table taking note of his dress and mechnical leg. Spotting the robes it reminded him of stories of Jedi before the purge. He looked for what would be a lightsaber hilt that may be visable. (OOC:perception +9 to look for a lightsaber hilt)
He motioned for them to sit. With a nod he walked with Tar'ja to the table and sat next to her. She still seemed to be calm for the moment.
**"Yes, I think we all have few questions to ask. The one formost on our minds is our friend. When will she be joining us."** the question was direct and straight to the point. will she stay a prisoner or be released.

Calmed and feeling an odd mix of relief and security, one of those something she wasn't sure about but only had the word and the meaning of it to go on, the twi'lek kept to the embrace. "I like that too." he whispered to her, the mirth in his voice catching as she smiled and offered a light and short laugh.
"I can sense Deidra. From what I can tell she alright. She's stressed pretty badly but she's ok." Well....that was good to know, she was still calm, and starting to wonder if this hugging thing was having an adverse effect on her like how some drugs do...could hugging be a drug? Well..if one hugged and they have a syringe or some- "Looks like we have company."
Blinking quickly to clear her thoughts she turns to the three that enter, her back straightens as the tall Neimodian passes, her features smoothing back into the cool persona that was her typical. Moving to a seat she watched the guards, armed guards...in a room with people that might be joining them...he was either taking precautions in the event of an Imperial attack, unlike as he said SBC spoke well of them, or he was sure that they might attack for taking their friend...friend...how strange a word and label yet it speaks so much.
She was about to ask but Chase beat her to it. "Yes, I think we all have few questions to ask. The one foremost on our minds is our friend. When will she be joining us." Well...not quite what she had been about to ask but likely the more polite question.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-07-01 16:25:22)

After he asked his question Chase simply sat there stunned. He replayed what he had just heard in his head right before he asked Captain Runn about Deidra.
*Questions I will try to answer for you.* The voice was clearly Runn's how he confused it for a womans earlier he wasn't sure. Training maybe.
He looked again at Runn. It's only the brown robes that gives the young Jedi it sense of familiarity. Of seeing Master Garet wearing his. Passing it off as just plain old robes covering his older, yet not quite weaker, frame.
***Could it be? Was it you that I heard upon arriving.*** He thought as he waited for his verbal and non-verbal question to be answered.

<strong> Tribble-ations? </strong>
Though it does make her headache worse, for a moment, Naryen is grateful that the light is now coming from all around her rather than pointed directly at her abused eyes. The mention of "finishing", though, does cause her a little concern.
Noting the posture and demeanor of her interrogators her predicament is found even more puzzling. ***Clearly they don't see me as a threat to them… strange.***
The Cerean bows "I am So-Maj. I have the rank of lieutenant in the alliance forces. Does that surprise you, we do not classify ourselves as a minor squad of rebels?" ***Hardly.*** "My associate here is Lieutenant Elara Moraal of Varlbrindal."
At this all mental hell breaks loose. Her desire to see another of her people, alive, though strong is not as strong as the pain the Empire caused her. To incubate her as kind of tumor to turn on the host, using her own people to kill themselves, end their culture. A sample of that betrayal now surges forth to the woman who looks at her with the same. A woman of rank, as she once was, of all people!
Naryens eyes flash to her with naked rage. ***How dare you look upon me like that!*** Quickly, however, that thought is wrestled away and she closes her eyes with a moment of calming effort. ***No, that's not fair. She was likely not an officer, if she even was enlisted.*** She turns back to So-Maj... Lieutenant So-Maj.**"No, it doesn't surprise me. Survival of a group requires organization and I'm familiar with the politics that must be navigated."** She recalls how many times she had seen maneuvers, of questionable or even unseen gain, where the result is the loss of good officers and usually quite a few skilled troopers. She is now more sure than ever that they were, in fact, political executions and not a case of her being unaware of the full scope of the tactics.
She turns to the woman and with a far calmer expression **"And in the Empire one needs to to survive lest you are seen as compromised, or disposable, and put to death!"** Her expression softens a little as she looks to "Lieutenant Elara Moraal of Varlbrindal" ***Please understand!***. Some part of her suggests that she should doubt that they are being truthful, that the are who they claim to be. But like a single voice in a large committee it's buried with the desire to see another Varbrini, alive.
Her voice and expression become more firm **"I assume you have recovered the security and communications back-up I had in my pad, which would include a record of Admiral Saycho conveying General Order 21, and another pad with the bounty I assume was placed on my head by the Empire."** She takes a breath. **"I barely escaped Saycho at Tatooine, with a young girl, when the Star of Cerea was destroyed in orbit. I doubt many others survived."**
She turns back to So-Maj. **"I have avoided this but"** she drops some defenses and allows her shoulders to slump under the strain of her experiences **"What happened on Varbrindal? The propaganda I was blinded with about Kashyyk would mean anything I'd know is suspect. What do you know?"** She wears her tired and pleading demeanor plainly.

When the Niemodian Officer, Kasga jerks to attention. He's unsure of the military protocol here. Usually, you don't salute officers in a foriegn military. Much confused, he stands against the wall looking stuffed.
Chase and Tar'ja lead in with the most obvious question: Deirdra. Better to get that settled before the discussion about the Reapers. That promises to be controversial.

As Captain Runn walks in and goes through the motions that all in position have done time and again. As his friends ask about Deidra. "Good day Captain. I am Dexter Jessek. My friends and I are grateful to you for what you have done for us so far, but what you did to are friend is not the way to get us to trust you. As my friends have said we would like to know that she is unharmed and not being detailed unfairly. If you can assure us of this then we can proceed."

Captain Runn listens to all of your questions one by one. Beside him the two guards stand motionless ever watchful. It does not take the B-1 droid long, it returns pushing a double stacked try. "Your order." The droid states as it lifts the cover off of one of the dishes, revealing steaming hot sea food surrounded by various vegetables.
Looking to each of your Capatin Runn continues. "Please eat as we talk I am sure you are all hungry for something better then rations." The Captain motions to the tray.

You examine the Captain but find no sign of weaponry of any kind. Inside you mind you hear the voice again "I come in peace I would hope you have as well. These are dark times one must be careful with those one would trust or attempt to call friend."

</details>

Looking to Chase Captain Runn answers "It is my hope that your friend ... Deidra as you call her will be joining us, perhaps soon." The Captain then looks to Tar`ja for a moment "Your records where one of the hardest to acquire, lucky for me I have extensive contacts. You are far from your house I know little about you beyond that. Care to tell us more about yourself Tar`ja?"
Dexter then asks his question, the Captain listens and responds "Hello and well meet Dexter Jessek." You notice how calm the Captain is how his words are almost rehearsed or well practiced. "For a member of the Bothan spy net your records where surprisingly easy to acquire. I would think that an individual with your training would appreciate the need to rule out double agents or possible double agents. Trust is earned not assumed. Your instructors would do well to remind you on that lesson."
Finally the Captain looks to Kasaga, you almost swear you could see fluid welling in his eyes. "Kasaga Hrato your brother spoke well of you and often. Kirn was on a mission for me would you happen to have any knowledge on his well being?"

For a moment both are silent Lt Elara Moraal opens her mouth to say something only to be cut off by Lt So-Maj clearing his throat. "We will tell you all we know about Varbrindal but first we need a full debriefing on the events as you say them while on duty there."

Tar'ja's attention deferred briefly to the droid that had returned, she didn't trust this person, and until the human was returned she didn't see that changing. However...his words brought a cold chill down her spine "Your records were one of the hardest to acquire, lucky for me I have extensive contacts. You are far from your house, I know little about you beyond that. Care to tell us more about yourself Tar`ja?"
He knew of the 'family', or at least their name, that made him low on her liking list...which wasn't long to begin with but the principle was the same. Her blood ran cold in her body, it shouldn't, she had nothing to hide from these people; but the fact that he knew of them...what contacts did he have to gain that knowledge..why did he want it, did he know of the others as well? did he know of the fate of the 'family'?
Her eyes narrow as her back straightens, her lekku tremble as she eyes him, a sudden calm moving over her, reverting back to training learned, closing off emotions; that was the best way to get a job done, a hunt or a walk was the same.
No emotions, no mistakes, no names, no sounds.
"They're dead. I'm alive. They rot. I'm free. I am good at what I do, and that is the only thing I will ever thank them for." Her eyes narrow "And that's all you need to know."

Dexter looks at the Captain he was a practiced politician, so getting a read on him would be hard, but that would not stop him. "Yes I understand the need. If Deidra was a double agent she would have done something before we arrived on the station. When we stop trusting we are no better then the foe we fight." Dexter looks at the food and realizes how long it was sense he had real food. "So I am not familiar with your house Captain, or with this port either. You have a good hidden yourself well, and are you sure those are my true recorders. Spy net protects it's own after all." Dexter smiles he was testing to see how far his contacts went. He didn't know much about Tar'ja's past other then what she has told him, but then again there could be secrets that even the spy net didn't know.

As the Captain gestures at the tray of food chase hears the man in his mind again. "I come in peace I would hope you have as well. These are dark times one must be careful with those one would trust or attempt to call friend."
The young Jedi's attention was split between the others as they spoke and the Runn. ***Yes we've come in peace. If this place and you are part of the Rebellion then even more so. At least for me. I can not speak for the others.***
What he said next about Deidra caught his attention. "It is my hope that your friend ... Deidra as you call her will be joining us, perhaps soon."
***Interesting yet not surprising. We probably should have seen it before. How many times have I used a different name? An Imperial on the run. Makes sense but why didn't she trust us after the fact to reveal herself.***
He listened as Runn spoke to Tar'ja. When the Jedi mentioned her 'family' he felt an immediate shift in her as her emotions spiked but them they faded away to where he was having trouble sensing them. ***Interesting she shutting off or down her emotions. Just what did this 'family' do to her.*** He thought to himself. She had said that she killed them all. Why? From what he was able to tell common everyday emotions seemed unfamiliar to her. Like she had no word or description to what she was feeling.
He watched his friend as he posture and demeanor changed before she spoke. "They're dead. I'm alive. They rot. I'm free. I am good at what I do, and that is the only thing I will ever thank them for." He watched as her eyes narrowed as she looked at Runn. "And that's all you need to know."
One of his eyebrows raised slightly as her words. They were cold and unemotional and the way they were stated it left no room for misunderstanding, she was finished talking about the 'family'.
Chase smiled at Dexter's response. Seeing the Bothan trying to fast talk about his past with spynet was amusing and it further solidified his thinking letting the others do the talking when the situation required it.
Chase looked at Runn again looking the man over. He spoke clearly for the others to hear. **"I'm sure SBC has told you quite a bit about us already. We all ended on on Tatooine in one form or another. Call it coincidence or fate. I for one have learned there's no such thing as coincidence. The Force brought the five of us together back on that planet for some reason. I'm sure of it."** He looked at Runn. **"I felt the presence of my former Master when I was lead to Kasga. From there we met the others."** He shifted gears. **"You've mentioned what you know about the others, what about myself. What do you know about me?"**

Kasga reins his hopes back as the Nemodian asks about Kirn and his mission. Tread carefully, this being has no ties to the Rebellion. 
Caught between his hopes and fears, Kasga speaks slowly, **"I'm sorry, you must be mistaken. I have heard nothing about Kirn being employed by House Runn. Indeed, I have been trying to find my brother as well. In what capacity do you know of him?"**

<strong> Tangled webs and other such niceness. Wonderful games we so play. </strong>
Naryens face falls as her mind accommodates Lt So-Majs request without her permission first. A swirl of sights sounds and smells, all of death and desperation, assails her and her face shows it. The result has her looking down with closed eyes as she pauses to steady her breath, with limited success. Her expression is dreamlike as she starts to speak, though it's clear immediately that the dream is pure nightmare. **"'Stability. Safety. Products of patience and devotion.' We devoted ourselves to the dream of the New Empire…"**
Her expression changes like how it seems water darkens as a stone is being raised through it. The tears that wet her cheeks seemed to freeze as her eyes chill over and her expression and tone changes to match. **"… the dream that was a lie."** her eyes turn, again, to Lt Elara Moraal with betrayal. ***You'd let me relive this?*** she considers their position, for an instant, as she washes the remnants of her misery from her face from deep within her mind. **"Fine! It's not like it's anything you either don't already know or will come to know shortly from others."** She turns her closed eyes, this time between her two hosts, and opens them. Her expression is neutral, the face she wears when delivering oral reports, but her tone isn't. The expression changes to match as she goes though her mental skills perform flawlessly to organize and present.
**"Sergeant Thomas Lars and a trooper escorted me to a briefing with Captain Prewart on the Adjudicator after we arrived at Varlbrindal."** she looks to the others faces at mention of the names so she can note their expressions. **"The briefing detailed orders from the Emperor to pursue a terrorist ship from Varltpin heading to Varlbrindal. No other intel was available… Captain Prewart was not impressed."** Naryens expression softened a little as she recalls the kind of man she thought him to be and how much she missed the way he ran things and how she felt as being part of his ranks. ***'Lies are just weeds that grow in the shadow of and living off the truth.' Not everything was a lie, just the important stuff.* "Likely because it was fabricated. Poorly."** Naryen sighed as regret rippled across her features to clear the way for her to continue. ***Things seem so different now. Hindsight and all that.*** **"We were there to investigate and prevent any actions they were going to take, but it seemed we were to late."**
She takes a shuddered breath and looks down at her hands, now folded on her lap. **"The briefing was interrupted when reports came in of explosions on the surface."** with a wry smile at the supposed reason for them being there. **"It seemed we were too late."** The smile was then bullied from her expression and tone. **"By the time we reached the Com Center of the Spaceport the troopers already planet-side were killing people. It was anarchy."** Now irritation. **"The Com Center was manned by green recruits barely out of Basic and one homicidal lunatic who ordered the troopers to kill civilians."** a look of cold satisfaction, **"One, late, Lt Prine."** sighs **"I rescinded the orders, after a brief disruption, and tried to organize the evacuations and get aid to the injured and dying but more incompetence hampered efforts."** ***Mine, mainly I suspect.***
She looks, again, to her hosts **"Com contact was lost with the Adjudicator when she came under attack, seemingly by small attack craft."** to see if they reveal anything. ***Your doing?*** **"Admiral Saycho called from Tatooine for a report."** Naryen pauses with an inward look. **"He was getting prepared to meet someone named… Jabba and there was a report of hostiles delaying his shuttle launch."** Her face now twists with rage and her breath quickens. **"That's when he conveyed General Order 21! On a fully populated planet that was covered in Imperial assets!" *It was the whole planet!* "That order was only intended to be used on front-line planets during maneuverer not fully populated core worlds!"** She gasps as she wrestles with her mood and wipes her face and eyes with now shaking hands. Balling her hands to fists then forcing them to relax she uses it as part of a centering exercise and tries to continue.
Having now organized her mind revelations crash together, one after another. **"My parents…"** her voice cracks, hard, as the looks of pain and betrayal, frozen in death on her parents faces stare at her with empty eyes from within her accursedly excellent memory. Lips tremble as sobs start joining her words tumbling from her mouth. Like rivers swelling and merging during a monsoon charged flood her story crashes through any semblance of composure. **"…everyone! Dead. Our whole reason for joining the Navy left rotting on the ground!"** Her eyes are squeezed shut now. **"When I called Thomas for help he all but condemned me to death, in his tone, as he said he was saving what lives he could. I don't think I ever told him that I was born Varbrindal."** Sobs and pain as everything she had been holding back for weeks tore out through her ragged face.
After a moment to catch her breath she continues. **"I dumped the communications core I had access to to my portable, destroyed the core, changed into civies, and ran to the Star of Cerea."** Her demeanor darkens again at another of her failures. ***Why didn't I try to talk to the captain to see where we were going. I could have convinced him to go elsewhere!*** Anger at her stupidity flared at that, then with a snarl of inwardly directed hatred **"Which was met by the Illustrious at Tatooine and destroyed. I barely escaped, again."** Her breath stops as what control remains, waiting in the background, surges forward to protect what was next in her rantings. Or rather *who*. ***They will not hear of Lahela from me! I'll die first.***. **"From there it's Mos Eisley and Tuskens stampedes and merchants who have to live under the watchful eyes of an Imperial garrison."**
She wipes her face again, and though her breathing is hard it's steadier than it was. She pulls her legs up to her chest and wraps her arms around them. Feeling and looking rather small. **"I've failed at everything I've ever tried to do as an Imperial Officer. I helped the Emperor kill and enslave instead of serve and protect."** She lowers her weary head to her knees. **"The only way I've been able to defy him is by staying alive, since I've not considered myself an Imperial Officer since Saycho issued the order that ended my people."** Now it sounds like she starts to rally herself. **"So that makes me a civilian now in all the ways that matter and thus subject to Order 22 under Imperial Military codes."** but the effect is fleeting and, while weeping weakly into her knees, she sobs out one more sentiment.
**"I just want to be with my Mom and Dad."** she doesn't care about very much now, including her own life, and it's conveyed plainly.

Captain Runn listens to Tar`ja`s brief story and nods. "Interesting, I never knew your family In have only made inquires I like to know who I am dealing with." The Captain waves his hand at his guards who seem to take a more relaxed stance at his side. "That is unfortunate to hear of your loss, too many have died in this war which has gone on far too long." Runn seems to daze off reflecting on his last statement.
The B-1 as if on some kind of automated programing speaks again "Could I get you anything?" Again the droids veiw is towards the middle of the room.
"Ah Dexter I am sure Koth Melan might disagree with you on that point." You recognize that name as one of the Spy Net instructors. "Due to the nature of our operations and to the enemy we must remain careful. There are too many lives at risk too much to lose." Captain Runn looks directly at Chase and says "I meet a jedi once, small of stature but wise beyond my knowing. He had said ... "In a dark place we find ourselves .... a little more knowledge might light our way. Good advise it is the reason we continue to operate and have done so for some time now."
When Chase speaks of SBC Runn nods "Yes SBC-54 has provided us with some information on your group. Your talk like many others I have meet in the past, many that have found an end in these dark times." The Captain pauses for a moment then turns to Kasga "Kirn has lived here for the last few years. His squad is based here, he and his group take orders from me, I take orders from the Rebel Alliance. Kirns squad has been instrumental in the local sectors striking out against the empire, I am surprised he did not tell you this he had always spoken highly of you."

Chase listened as Runn spoke. The whole time he never picked up on any deception from him. AS the droid spoke Chase found himself wondering if maybe Runn would be able to teach him anything. Garet had died before he had been able teach him any of the powers the Jedi Master had displayed. ***Another Jedi here. Maybe one who would be able to teach me like Garet. I wonder if he knew of Garet?***
The droid spoke again asking about refreshments. Chase waved off the droid as Runn spoke to Dexter about someone he knows. ***Indeed his contacts are vast if he's connected with the Bothan Spynet.***
He notices Runn look directly at him. "I meet a Jedi once, small of stature but wise beyond my knowing. He had said ... "In a dark place we find ourselves .... a little more knowledge might light our way." Good advise it is the reason we continue to operate and have done so for some time now."
Before he could respond Runn continued answering the questions posed to him never seeming to miss a step. The Jedi he mentioned sounded like Yoda. The ancient and wizened Jedi Master that Garet had talked about many times. He was always spoken about with much reverence. Garet had told him stories about how Yoda lead the Jedi Council up till the time Darth Vader and the Emperor ended the Jedi order.
Chase spoke when Runn had finished. **"I have heard much about the one you speak of. My former Master often spoke of him and used him as the basis of his lessons. I wonder if he's still alive?"** He looked at Runn as a more serious look came over his face. **"Are there any others like us here? I've learned much but still have a lot to learn.**

Kasga considers Captain Runn words carefully. He says he takes orders from the Rebellion, yet he identifies himself as House Runn, even to "new recruits". Kirn spoke of the Rebellion openly when trying to include me. If Kirn was based here, why isn't this guy more clear about his loyalties. Perhaps he's just a politician.
If I don't trust him, I may get no answers to where Kirn is. If I trust him, I may expose myself and him to worse attacks from what ever moles exist in his organization. He's better suited to find a mole than I am. If he is the traitor, I may end up dead quickly. Perhaps, a careful reveal will help me understand where he stands.
Kasga's face shows his indecision and lack of trust. Finally he breathes, **"Kirn is MIA, not known to be dead. We all ran when the mission came apart. Several other Reapers are known to be shot down, presumed dead."**

Tar'ja was not thrilled to say the least; this male had placed her in unease and her distrust was growing of him. Were she in his place she might have done the same, done all she could to learn of those that might be joining the cause; however he would have felt the same as her if his past was a touchy subject.
"Are there any others like us here? I've learned much but still have a lot to learn." She would have to admit she had only been half paying attention to things but the suddenness to his question, at least in her mind, made her backtrack; this male was a Jedi as well?
Her eyes narrowed, lekku twitching as some emotions rose back to the surface, mistrust for one before she pushed it back down again. No emotions...not if he could feel them too.
"Be lucky you had not met them or knew of them more." else we would not being having this...pleasant...conversation. She had not been taking kindly to those that knew of the 'family' for some time, the simple knowledge often resulted in a guard or two having to hold her back.

Dex listens to the Captain. He remember the instructor he mentioned, they never really got along that well, something to do with the time that he had sliced the schools computers and changed his scores. "Well I see you are connected. I look forward to working with you then." He listens to others reveal more of there past. He filed it away for future use if needed. He starts to eat some of the food that was brought before them. "So you had some questions for us?"

Captain Runn looks to Chase "Like us!" Runn laughs. "You do have a lot to learn young one. All jedi are unique, all jedi are special and each jedi that I have meet have surprised me in their own way." Runn pauses for a moment before continuing "You are not a jedi, not yet anyway. You have much to learn much to discover. I am no jedi, this may surprise you many who know of the force in this galaxy in one form or another do not label themselves jedi."
As Kasga speaks revealing the possible status of Kirn`s squad Captain Runn pauses. The Captain looks upset staring off at the door for a moment. "I hope you are wrong Kasga the Reapers are a resourceful group .... if they are gone .... well I do not know." This is one of the first times your group has seen emotion from the Captain, you sense no deception here. "Kirn`s room is yours, you are his next of kin his belongings are now yours. I will have an aid show you to his room whenever you are ready."
Tar`ja`s feelings are projected into her questions, which snaps Captain Runn from his thoughts. "We do interview all possible candidates into the rebellion. We do not accept just anyone you know. We might be under manned but the ability to kill a storm trooper does not make one a rebel."
Runn rubs his head "This has been a pleasant conversation, we will talk again but first I have other matters to attend to. I am sending relief supplies to Dosennaa`s farm did you have messages you would like to send with it?"

Tomas is still as large as you remember but now in a rebel uniform. The uniform is camouflaged he must be a ground officer. His hair though shaggy while under your command has grown even longer.

Her temper cooled a bit but a worry and fear seaped through the walls, was her little one alright? was she studying well? what if this was a trap? could he really be trusted with her name?

<strong> Tangled webs and other such niceness. Wonderful games we play with ourselves. </strong>
Naryens breath, though ragged and weak with her sobs, stops when she hears that Thomas lives. The feeling, alien and often hidden from her, from the past steps from the background of her mind and presents itself plainly.
Then quickly changes its attire to a bright mote of jealousy that points itself squarely at the woman identified as being from her home. ***Did you fall into his arms as your savior.***
It's all she can do not to burst out laughing at the sheer audacity and ludicrousness of her own mind. ***In all this time, you secretly desired that man. Your closest thing to a real friend. You pathetic schoolgirl!*** She takes a single breath, that flows into a sigh, and focuses on it to relax. The knowledge that he lives lends her strength so she can smile, though sincere and weak, not entirely without layers. **"I'm happy he's alive."*I have so many questions.***
She begins to wipe her face with shaking hands and tries again to compose herself and realizes that some of what she feels, and her preening, is anticipation at seeing him again. Her blush is noticeable and she looks down and the floor, with care not to look at Lt Elara Moraal, just in case she may be right about Thomas and Elara having relations.
She uses that distraction to rally herself, somewhat, and speaks to Lt So-Maj. **"I assume my questions, about my home-world, will wait until after he speaks, though he was nowhere that he could witness my efforts."**

Kasga mutters under his breath, **"I'd rather have Kirn here to laugh at me worrying"**
At least he feels loyalty toward the Reapers and their next of kin. Considering what could have happened to Kirn, Kasga quavers, **"Thank you, I would like to see his room."**
Kasga recognizes a dismissal when he hears one. Captain Runn speaks bruskly to Tar'ja given her unwillingness to reveal her whole story. Given her confession in hyperspace, he does not blame her. I don't trust him either.

Runn's answer to his question catches him off guard and surprises him. "You do have a lot to learn young one. All Jedi are unique, all Jedi are special and each Jedi that I have meet have surprised me in their own way." The Captain paused fora second but Chase had already averted his gaze somewhat. "You are not a Jedi, not yet anyway. You have much to learn much to discover. I am no Jedi, this may surprise you many who know of the force in this galaxy in one form or another do not label themselves Jedi." He brought his gaze back to Runn as the alien continued to speak. Somehow he felt that he had offended Runn.
**"No offense meant Captain Runn. And yes I do know that there are other Force traditions in the galaxy. By your dress I assumed wrong. I'll not make that mistake again."** Chase sat back in his chair. While it didn't show upon his face he felt embarrassed to have made such a mistake to assume that Runn was a Jedi.
***Use your head Chase. You see Jedi like robes and you immediately think he's a Jedi.*** He took a breath in an attempt to calm himself as he listened to Runn talk to the others. Kasga's brother and the Reapers may be KIA. The Rebellion does interviews. ***What does one have to do to fail the interview I wonder.***
He watched Runn rub his head. "This has been a pleasant conversation, we will talk again but first I have other matters to attend to. I am sending relief supplies to Dosennaa`s farm did you have messages you would like to send with it?" The young Jedi smiled at the mention of Dosennaa and the farm. He thought of Tar'ja and how happy she would be to get a message to her little one.
When he looked her way he was surprised. The look on her face was one of panic, fear for her little one. ***She doesn't trust him yet. And why should she or any of us for that matter? Somethings fit and some don't yet. I wonder when Deidra will return to us?*** He thought.
He reached out his hand and places it over hers. He could feel how hard she was gripping the chair in fear. Fear for another.
**"Tar'ja."** He said softly. **"Are you alright? I'm sure everyone at Dosennaa's is alright."**

Dexter had gotten hardly anything from the captain,other what the he had aloud out. He had connections to be sure, he known details about each of them that where not common knowledge. It was sad to hear that Kasga's brother might be gone with the rest of his team. Dex had lost friends before, it was part of what he did. The biggest blow was the loss of his parents when he was younger. It seemed to still effect him to this day. As the Captain mentioned the women who had taken them in back on Tatoonie. "Yes, tell her we are safe. Also thank her for us for helping us, and giving us a direction that maybe for the better."
Dexter was surprised that Tar'ja had not wanted to check on the young one that she had with her. Turning to her. "Do you want to check on your little one. This maybe the only chance you get for awhile." He didn't want to upset his friend. A specially one that could kill him with little effort. It wasn't that Dex trusted the Captain all that much. He could have just as easily turned them over to the Empire and washed his hands of them. It would take awhile before there was any trust at all was built, but they where alive and that had count for something.

Tar'ja's hands had turned white as she gripped the chair. Could he really be trusted? she had to work out a code...she had..to.."Tar'ja." She turned wide eyes to him "Are you alright? I'm sure everyone at Dosennaa's is alright." She watches him unsure of what this feeling was but it had gripped at her, she didn't really know what to call it or what to do about.
"Do you want to check on your little one. This maybe the only chance you get for awhile." The bothan.
Her gaze snapped to him, her eyes narrowing as the panic grew with a rage. How dare he mention her in the presence of one that was still in question of trust!
Her tone was sharp as she glared at the Bothan though spoke to the alien "Keep to your Studies." She says simply "Tell her I said to keep to your studies." She didn't wish to tell him who it was to go to, she would just hope that Dosennaa would understand.

Chase's eyes opened wide when Dexter mentioned the little one. He shook his head to ward him off but it was too late. ***Oh no you didn't*** He thought as he felt the emotions spike in Tar'ja. Overwhelming panic filled with rage simply flowed from his friend. Not even thinking it possible, with his hand over hers, he felt her grip the arm of the chair even tighter.
***She afraid for Lyn`aris. Of her being there alone unprotected, not being there to watch out for her. I need to calm her down and quickly.*** He thought quickly.
He squeezed her hand a bit tighter and spoke her name to get her attention. **"Tar'ja!"** He said urgently getting her to turn her head. **"It will be alright. You know what kind of person Dosennaa is and that she protects all that are there in every way possible.** He looked her in the eyes trying to keep her attention. **"You're scared and worried, it's natural. It comes from wanting to protect one of your own from harm."** He was grasping at straws as he tried to calm he a bit. He had no doubt that if Dex pushed her anymore at this moment He would be pulling her off of the smaller Bothan.

Dex was alarmed at her reaction to what he had said. He throught sence she cared for her charge a lot that she would want to give her some message that she was not alone in the galaxy. Dexter physically recoils as her anger rose to breaking point. He thought she would end him there on the spot. Then he felt ashamed for his actions. He had crossed a line that he was not supposed to cross and he would have to make up for it some how. He always seemed to destroy what he had built when came to people. It was why he preferred to work alone most of time. Thinking to himself. "Dexter you can be the biggest idiot sometimes. Best if you keep your mouth shut and your ears open! You could have killed yourself right there. "

Tar'ja firey gaze still aimed at the bothan was unwavering, if looks could kill the bothan might have simply dropped dead on the spot, as it stands though; they don't, and he didn't, but he might be quite happy that she wasn't armed at the moment...then again this might result in watching shadows for a while.
"Tar'ja!" Her gaze didn't move but she turned her head slightly to the Jedi at her side, to show she was at least listening. "It will be alright. You know what kind of person Dosennaa is and that she protects all that are there in every way possible."
He turned her head, unable to keep her gaze on the bothan she turns the glare to the Jedi, only to have it begin to cool as her body relaxed; "You're scared and worried, it's natural. It comes from wanting to protect one of your own from harm."
scared..worried...yes...that was what she felt..Lyn...she didn't want anyone to know about her or that there was someone that had ties to her in the galaxy else danger be brought upon her head. She wondered briefly if this was what a mother was really supposed to feel, if they were supposed to feel..panic..and fear..and a sense of murder for anyone that dared mention the child existence to anyone outside of a group..
She nodded slowly, her hands releasing the chair; the pain bringing her mind back more to cool the anger; her eyes turn dull as she looks to him, she wanted to say something, anything, wanted to tell him she was terrified that this...this being that was still at the table would hurt Lyn, or that he would send imperials, and that she was too far away to be under the twi'lek's protection; but she couldn't...wouldn't...she wouldn't acknowledge that she knew any child, that the child meant so much to her; that may have already been blown but she couldn't risk saying anything about her..she couldn't.

Kasga's eyes narrow as Dexter puts his foot in his mouth. Knowing the compromised state of this Rebellion cell, Kasga now has some idea why.
He comments dryly to Tar'ja, **"Why don't we drop it for now. We will need to take time to discuss where we stand."**

After he had screwed up massively. Dexter takes some food and drink and retreats away for Tar'ja and the others. He knew they no longer trusted him and with good reason. He would make this up to her and them some how. He had to.

Now that Tar'ja's attention was off Dexter, Chase could see that the blind rage of just a moment ago was slipping. The anger was still there. Anger that a chink in her seemingly cool exterior was shattered by the existence of a child that she cared for. One that was so far away she had no hope in protecting if danger was upon her. He felt her hand relax as her death grip on the arm of the chair loosened. He kept his hand with hers in an attempt to offer some sort of comfort.
He saw Dex grab what food was in front of him and leave the table away from them. The look on his face said enough about how he felt. Chase felt sorry as he wouldn't want Tar'ja to be looking at him the way she did at Dexter. The wrong words had been said at the wrong time.
At Kasga's words Chase looked at Runn who now stood at the table where he had been sitting. **"Captain Runn, have we passed your requirements or are we required to stay here for the time being? If Kasga is taking his brothers room will rooms also be provided for the rest of us?"** He paused for a moment. **"And what of Deidra…when will she be joining us?"**
Kasga was right they needed a time to regroup weather in the ship which was preferred. While Chase still felt no feelings of deception from anyone he was probably the one that trusted their hosts the most at the moment. It wasn't a full trust like with the others not yet that would come with time, hopefully. There were still many questions to be asked and answered.

Captain Runn walks to the door his guards still in flanking positions. "I realize you have no reason to trust me or those I represent, but you must understand that we also have no reason to trust you. I will relay your message to the farm for your Dexter. If any of you change your mind we have been sending regular supplies to Dosennaa`s farm for years now." Captain Runn smiles, "all those kids so happy."
As Chase asks his last question Runn nods "Your friend is safe, actually she is sleeping at the moment. You will see her soon enough. I will meet with you all again.
Captain Runn leaves the room giving your group some time to talk. A few moments later a large human enters the room dressed in a camouflaged rebel uniform which do little to conceal his rather large muscles. The man wear a rank insignia and greets you with a smile "Hello my name is Lt Tomas Lars." The man looks directly at Kasga "I recognize you! Kasy! You are without a doubt Kirns brother." Only your brother had ever called you that and only when you where younger. "Man you have grown, well I mean since the pictures that is." Tomas stands at attention and salutes Kasga. "Where are my manners, I will escort you to your brothers room. I will also escort your company to accommodations as well."
Tomas brings you through another series of corridors, this place is huge. finally stopping Tomas opens a door "You and your friends can bunk here." Inside several bunks line the walls. A large screen dominates the far wall, the room has only one other door possible a refresher. "Kasy ... Kasa this way to your brothers room."
Down the hall Tomas stops again and open a similar sized room. The room has only a single bunk two large window one that looks outside into the gas giants atmosphere the other a hanger bay. All around the room are pictures of ships, battles some professionally painted others hand drawn by children. Beside the single bunk are pictures of your family, you and your brother.
"I will leave you ... call if you need anything." Tomas salutes again then turns to leave. "Is your report true? About reaper squad that is?"
For Deidra`s eyes only
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Lt So-Majs nods to Lt Tomas "You are dismissed."
"Sir yes sir!" Lt Tomas salutes then departs the room.
Both Lt So-Majs and Lt Elara Moraal look at each other. Then back to you. Lt So-Majs speaks first "This changes everything, don`t you think?"
To your surprise Lt Elara Moraal "Yes it does, she might even prove useful."
Lt So-Majs looks you directly in the eyes "Would you be willing to provide a detailed report on everything you know. The empires strength fleet positions as you last knew them. Current strategies everything?"

Tar'ja watches the Captain leave, shaking her head; how were they to trust what he said? after everything they had been through..where was the proof..where was the..
The door slid open and she turned quickly, expecting the woman to be walking through the door regardless of if he had said she was asleep. Her leeku fell back to her back with a sigh, disappointed to see only a human male. She listened vaguely to him, he seemed to know this brother of Kasgas but really everyone seemed to know him in this place.
It would be nice to have a room, though...she didn't think she'd be able to sleep until Deidra had been returned to them safely, as it stood she hadn't eaten much if anything at all; ignoring hunger pains in favor of waiting to eat with her friend. Standing she looks to her human with a faint grin, waiting for him to stand only to take his arm; she wouldn't let this one leave her side...not with how she felt about him..
Following silently behind and into the room she takes a bed and sighs, taking a seat with a rub to her eyes. She didn't want to sleep, she didn't want to, but she needed to...she felt...awful and so tired as though sleep had never been had for years.

Dexter listens to the Captain. Quietly nodding when the he said he would deliver the message. As the Captain leaves he states the obvious that either side was going to trust each other right away. That would take time and a great deal of effort.
When the Lt. walks in and talks to Kasga about his brother and taking them to place where they can rest. Dexter waits for everyone to exit the room and then follows behind the party. Making sure to pay close attention to the route they took and counting his steps. Mentally taking each turn and room they went through. Any areas that my be of importance no matter how small.
As they enter there room for lack of a better term. He makes sure to give Tar'ja plenty of space and to stir clean of her if possible. He had no interest in dieing at her hands if it could be helped.
He stares at the giant screen on the wall. Trying to find if it had any access point or any controls that might activate it. He suddenly found himself using old skills that he had only used for his own benefit, now for the benefit of others. If things became worse he would get his friends back to the ship and off the station if cust him his own life.
((OCC: Gather Information +15 for figuring out the path they took from the first room to the second room, also Preseption check +9 for that as well. When they get to the second room Preseption check +9 to find the controls or an access point for the screen in the room.))

Chase watched and listened as Runn headed for the door. The young Jedi had to admit that Run was right. There wasn't much on the table for either side to trust each other. Chase trusted more than the others he figured but then again he had an unfair advantage over the others. Left alone they were all quiet rather than breaking into chatter. Deidra was foremost on their minds he figured which kept the talk down. Runn had said that she'd be joining them soon. Chase hoped it was sooner than later for everyone's sake. He was able to calm Tar'ja down last time he wasn't so sure that he's be able to do so again.
When the door reopened he looked along with Tar'ja but was also disappointed to see that it wasn't Deidra. In her place stood a human male on the larger side of large wearing a fatigues with rebellion emblems. Introducing himself as Tomas Lars he seemed to be at ease being in their company. Not surprisingly he knew Kasga. At least by picture which he clarified rather quickly. Quickly they were offered a place to bunk down. He looked up at Tar'ja who was already standing next to him. He caught her faint grin as he stood. His offered arm was taken by the lithe Twi'lek and he felt himself smile all the more at her touch and closeness to him. His own feelings for her were becoming stronger as time passed and he knew it. He just wondered if Tar'ja knew it was happening to her also or could put words to the feelings she was experiencing. They were probably very close to mimicking his own. He gave her hand that held his arm a reassuring pat with his free hand as they walked behind the Lt.
Upon arriving at their room Tomas opened the door and spoke to Kasga, "You and your friends can bunk here."
**"Thanks."** Chase said with a nod as he walked in with Tar'ja. As he passed the threshold to the room he heard Tomas say that he would lead Kasga to his brothers room. Looking about there wasn't much. Several bunks, a large screen and one other door that was probably the refresher adorned the room.
Tar'ja removed herself from his arm as she claimed a bunk. She looked tired as he watched her walk to the bunk, beautiful but tired. He followed her and took the bunk next to hers. Looking around he saw Dexter doing what he does best. Taking in the room. It was evident that the Bothan had taken to keeping a distance from Tar'ja after the incident in the board room.
He sat down and rested his head in his hands. He wasn't tired but he knew that he could sleep. Looking to his right he saw her rubbing her eyes. ***She's really tired but I know that she'd never admit it to me.***
He brought up his feet on the bunk an positioned his head so it would be closer to Tar'ja and not his feet. **"Sleep might be the best thing we can do right now. Well maybe some food. I should have grabbed a tray. Anything would be better right now than the ships rations."**
He shifted on his pillow as he looked at Tar'ja. **"I don't know how to explain it but I have a feeling that things will be alright. If it is a trap or a setup of some sort its very very elaborate. The way things fit together makes it so that this place can't be other than what Runn and the others say it is."**
He looked at her and smiled. **"Deidra will be back with us soon. She has a good head on her shoulders and will have information and seen things that I imagine we haven't seen yet. It should help us come to a decision on what to do."**
He didn't need the Force see the range of emotions that she was experiencing. The worry about their friend still being held by Runn's people. The doubt about leaving her little one back on the farm with Dosennaa. A lot had happened in the time since that had all met. More than some experience in a lifetime. ***I wish it was a simple case of just holding her close to make everything better but it's not that easy. It never is, although…***
He smiled at her. The look in his eyes slightly betrayed his mischievous thoughts before he shut them down and placed his head on the pillow so he wouldn't get himself into anymore trouble. **"Yeah maybe some sleep would do me some good."** He said softly. His thoughts and feelings about Tar'ja were causing a lot of his training to go right out the airlock. While Master Garet never forbade relationships they had to be treated carefully. The emotions that come with relationships can be very strong and right now he couldn't agree more with that.

Tar'ja sighs as she looks over to the Jedi near her, "Sleep might be the best thing we can do right now. Well maybe some food. I should have grabbed a tray. Anything would be better right now than the ships rations." she laughs tiredly, she had reached a point that she had never had before, the feeling of just....empty..no..not empty..she didn't know what to do, she didn't feel..well..she did but..it was sort of dull. she was too tired, just tired all around.
"I don't know how to explain it but I have a feeling that things will be alright. If it is a trap or a setup of some sort its very very elaborate. The way things fit together makes it so that this place can't be other than what Runn and the others say it is." She knew that...it didn't mean she trusted it..
"Deidra will be back with us soon. She has a good head on her shoulders and will have information and seen things that I imagine we haven't seen yet. It should help us come to a decision on what to do."
"yea...you're right.." she says softly, eyes down cast as she thinks that over, she was a good fighter, and a good thinker, she wouldn't die on us..not with her own little one still in need of her..no..she'd be fine. Had to be.
She hoped that her little one would be alright, she hoped everything would be fine, but she doubted..she hated that feeling but she was doubtful of what was going to happen...what's more she didn't know what was going to happen..and she hated that even more.
Sighing a long suffering sigh she rubs her eyes. She needed to sleep as much as she didn't want to and she had this...odd feeling..
Turning pale eyes to the Jedi she moves from her bunk and lays down beside him on his, facing him with a soft sigh "I don't understand feelings...explain this one to me..please? I don't want to be alone...and I enjoy being around you...and this weird safe feeling." She frowns though it wasn't nearly as hard as usual, soft as though it took too much effort to really frown "I don't understand them.."

### **Yogi** (2010-07-18 09:14:22)

"Yea...you're right.." He heard her say as he tried to get comfortable on the bunk. His eyes taking in the room and Dexter still going about his room detail. Seconds after he had just closed his eyes he felt movement on his bunk. Opening them quickly he saw Tar'ja sitting down on the side of the bunk.
**"Tar'ja, whats wrong?"** He said as he moved back to make more room for her on the, now seemingly small, bunk. She continued to lower herself till she laid down right next to him. She faced him and he felt the soft sigh escape her lips as she spoke. "I don't understand feelings...explain this one to me..please? I don't want to be alone...and I enjoy being around you...and this weird safe feeling." She frowned but it seemed forced. "I don't understand them.."
**"I…"** He started and stopped. He wasn't sure on how to explain it to her. He smiled softly and took one of her hands in his and held it, letting the two hands rest between them. He spoke softly almost whispered just for her. **"I think I understand how you feel. I feel the same. I want to be around you. It makes me feel good, happy and safe. No one wants be alone and they don't wanting to feel that way either. I don't."**
He looked into her pale blue eyes and smiled. He knew right there that he had lost that battle of trying not to fall for her. Two very different people they were from extremely different backgrounds. Yet somehow they found comfort just by being next to each other. He gave her hand a gentile squeeze.
**"I think how the family treated you when you were young and growing up has made you the way you are. You're strong and resilient. Able to take care of yourself in just about any situation. They shaped you like that so you could do what they wanted. Yet compassion is still there, I can see that in the way you look at your little one and the smile she brings to your face. They haven't erased those emotions away from you. You just never got to experience them. They are there waiting for something to bring them out."** He stopped for a second and smiled sincerely. **"You're getting a crash course in emotions Tar'ja. You're learning things in a few weeks time that you should have learned from the start. You're beginning to care for others even love them like in Lyn`aris's case. I think that's why you felt so strongly when Dexter mentioned her to Runn. Tell me when you think of her do you get this…hollow feeling in the pit of your stomach? A feeling that seems like only seeing her again could remove?"**

Kasga's eyes cut sideways as the Captain talks about trust. A grim snirk cuts across his cheek.
The burly human enters to guard them until Captain Runn finds and escort to quarters. Kasga prepares to wait and is completely flummoxed by Lt Tomas direct address.
Where did he hear that name? I haven't been called that since before joining the Travotti pliot corps. Kasga stands gaping as the LIEUTENANT salutes him. Utterly confused, Kasga is two beats behind with the return salute.
Thankfully, the lieutenant does not favor him with more familiarity he is unprepared to deal with and just leads them off to their barracks. Pain and comfort mix very badly inside Kasga as he follows in the man's wake. He never expected to find a place so full of Kirn and yet so truly empty of him.
He's dimly aware that he's cut out from the group and too confused to be wary. The man opens Kirn's room and leads him inside. Worse, this is officer's quarters and again so full of Kirn. Tears roll down Kasga's face as he looks around his brother's empty home. He wanders inside and looks at the blurry pictures his brother has been drawing since he could remember.
Kasga is dimly aware of Lt Tomas' attempt to exit and his forlorn question. Not really capable for further deception now, Kasga just nods.

Tar'ja listens to his explanation, she supposed that made sense; it would certainly explain why everyone else understood things and she didn't. Still...it was just another reason to hate the dead, what else had they kept from her? what else was she doing to have to learn the hard way?
"You're getting a crash course in emotions Tar'ja. You're learning things in a few weeks time that you should have learned from the start. You're beginning to care for others even love them like in Lyn`aris's case. I think that's why you felt so strongly when Dexter mentioned her to Runn. Tell me when you think of her do you get this...hollow feeling in the pit of your stomach? A feeling that seems like only seeing her again could remove?"
She nods her head slowly, she did, especially when she thought of her being in danger; she was beginning to wish she had stopped to get her and take her with them so that she would always know she was safe and near by. "Yes...it's unpleasant.." she crinkles her nose, she didn't like the feeling; she hated people at least she use to, it's why she always liked working alone. Granted that has changed since meeting these people but..still...she never actually wanted a little one and now that she has one.
She looks back to the Jedi's eyes, locking blue to pale blue "what is it though?"

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-07-19 12:55:46)

He watched her nod her head slowly to his question. ***All of these new emotions were not easy on her. Well not new really it finally getting a definition to go with what she's feeling. That's causing the turmoil within her. To be honest it's not so easy on you either Chase and you've experienced these emotions before.***
"Yes...it's unpleasant.." He smiled when she crinkled her nose. It was cute to say the least as it was so unlike her to do something like that.
She looked him in the eyes and her look locked his with hers. Those eyes had so much to say but not always the means to express it. To say that he didn't notice their closeness on the now seeming smaller bunk would be a lie. It was not an uncomfortable feeling. In fact he rather liked it as he could see and feel the rise of her body as she breathed as one lilac colored lekku had settled down between them.
"What is it though?" She asked softly and with such innocence that if he had heard right now that she had killed her family he would have had trouble believing it.
He gave her the half smile that he's used with her quite a few times now. **"It's an emotion that can be the happiest and yet the saddest. It can make you happy by just being with someone and sad to be apart from them as well. It's called love Tar'ja. You love Lyn`aris. Much like any mother would love a child. It's not something to be frightened of. Many don't find that with another in their lives. Those that do are considered lucky."** He gave her a warm smile as he continued to hold her hand.

Tar'ja frowns *It's called love Tar'ja.* Love? that's what it was? that...sickening feeling of pain and worry and fear was a simple four letter word? Why was it so...so...horrible? he made it seem like it could be wonderful but at this moment it didn't feel like it could be..
Sighing her lekku twitch as she thinks over this new word for an emotion. "I don't understand how it can be good...it feels awful and hardly worth any form of joy..." Then again if she thought back to the farm, and imagined what Lyn was doing..seeing her study and receave the information in life she had never had...she did feel happy about that...picturing her made her feel a bit happier too..maybe there was something to do this after all..
"What about the other one? the..safe with you and happy and good...you make me smile and relax..you calmed me down when I would have likely killed that bothan." She motion vaguely towards said bothan "so...what's that one then?"

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-07-19 17:18:17)

He could see her thing over his words. He could only imagine how hard it was to take this all in. He watched her sigh. "I don't understand how it can be good...it feels awful and hardly worth any form of joy..." She stopped as if in thought. He could feel her emotion turn to something happy. Maybe she was thinking of Lyn which caused the shift. He waited for her to ask any more questions which she did.
"What about the other one? the..safe with you and happy and good...you make me smile and relax..you calmed me down when I would have likely killed that Bothan." She gestured towards Dexter "So...what's that one then?"
He chuckled but not in a mean way. It was honest. She was looking for answers and he hoped he had them.
**"Remember when I was telling you about different kinds of hugs?"** He looked at her and saw her nod slightly. **"Well this is where it can get tricky. Love can be like that. Love between a parent and child like you and Lyn or between friends. Even…"** He stopped for a moment as he looked at her. Not sure if he should continue any further. He didn't want to put what his own wants into what he told her.
He looked down at her hand that he held and then back up to those big pale blue eyes and he knew that he had to be honest with her. **"Those thing you said you feel when your with me I feel also when I'm with you."** He stopped and took a breath to calm himself. **"I want to be next you so we can feel safe together. Seeing you smile brings a smile to my own face and gives me that feeling like I've done something good."** He hadn't intended to say so much but it just rolled off his tongue as he continued. **"There can be a love between two people that words can't describe. Which is probably why I'm having trouble thinking of them at the moment."** His voice rose a bit above a whisper at the end. He sighed again. **"I don't know. Sometimes I don't know how to explain it myself."**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-07-19 17:33:01)

"Remember when I was telling you about different kinds of hugs?" She nodded to this, that was a whole different thing but at least that was easier to understand...kinda..
"Well this is where it can get tricky. Love can be like that. Love between a parent and child like you and Lyn or between friends. Even..." even? even what? It must have showed on her face that she wanted to know as he continued,
"Those thing you said you feel when your with me I feel also when I'm with you. I want to be next you so we can feel safe together. Seeing you smile brings a smile to my own face and gives me that feeling like I've done something good." She flushed pink, she wasn't really sure why she was turning colors but...it felt good..like when she had been complimented for doing a good job.
"There can be a love between two people that words can't describe. Which is probably why I'm having trouble thinking of them at the moment. I don't know. Sometimes I don't know how to explain it myself." Well that only served to confuse her all the more.
So love could be different, a love for a child as a parent was caring and worrying and awful when they aren't there but good when they are...but love between friends was...something like it and then there was a third that couldn't be described...well why not?
She was very confused, trying to piece things together; yes sometimes she did have trouble making her thoughts known but she had attributed that to not having the thought fully formed to speak...after all she had been allowed to speak unless she knew exactly what she was going to say without stutter.
So he was having trouble finding words at time..he felt good when he saw her and he didn't like not being around her? so...then by his own words.. "so that means you love me then?" Straightforward with confusion in her eyes, a want to understand what the hell all these things were.

Chase smiled big when he made her skin flush pink with color. It was things like that he was beginning to enjoy doing to her. Besides the additional color enhanced her already alluring shade of lilac. He watched her try and process what he had said. Of course he didn't help much by not having a good answer for her. The topic was a tough one, not the easiest to explain to one who basically had no concept of what love is or was.
***Face it Chase she's new to this it may take her a while to figure this out.*** Despite their closeness his thoughts were forefront in his mind and he half heard he speak. It wasn't till it registered what she had said that his eyes fixed on hers.
"So that means you love me then?" His eyes widened as his body stiffened. ***How in karking hell did she come up with that one? It's written all over my face.*** The shock of her word added his own shade of pink to his flushed face. It could all but confirm what she had said.
**"Ahh, um…"** He stumbled over his first few words. He looked down but quickly looked at her again. ***How did she? What did I say? Just kiss her maybe she'll forget the question. No that may backfire bad.*** He had several thousand more thoughts running through his mind all because of one question.
He tried to compose himself and softly cleared his throat. **"What…what makes you say that Tar'ja?"** His eyes softened as they said alot, much more than what his mouth was saying at the moment.

Tar'ja watches him change in color, had she said something wrong? no...no listen to his speech..he was nervous! but why was he nervous? did this have something else to do with love? If it meant someone was always nervous around another was that really worth the emotion?
"What...what makes you say that Tar'ja?" a brow raises had he forgotten? was *that* another sign of love? "The way you described the love between two people that are not a mother and daughter love was very much the same...you have trouble finding the words, and you enjoying being around me..I make you smile and you feel good and your stuttering brings me to this conclusion..."
Her frown deepens, growing a bit worried that she really had said something wrong "did I say something wrong? was I not supposed to make that assumption?"

"...I make you smile and you feel good and your stuttering brings me to this conclusion..." He listened to her as she spoke. She had been able to piece together when she heard, felt and maybe understood some of the feelings they had for each other. He looked over her shoulder and saw Dex looking over some vid equipment. He didn't look like he was listening in not that he really cared. Besides this wasn't exactly the placed for a 'private' conversation like this but yet again he didn't particularly care.
He let his head come back down again on the pillow, perhaps a bit closer to hers than before. He saw the frown upon her face saw it deepen. He not only felt the worry in her emotions he saw it in her eyes. "Did I say something wrong? Was I not supposed to make that assumption?"
He smiled as he shook his head amazed. Here was someone who for most of her life lived it with out the positive emotions one generally never thinks twice about and hits it right on the head. His smile turned into a soft chuckle. He let go of her hand and brushed the back of his fingers down the soft skin of her cheek. **"No Tar'ja you did nothing wrong. For not knowing much about emotions you are very intuitive to them. More so than you may think. Your assumption about my feelings are correct. I have fallen for you."** He smiled. His nervousness had for the most part subsided in his voice but was still somewhat present in his eyes. He had laid his heart out on the table. Something he hadn't done in quite a while since the last time it was broken. Just over three years ago when he left Corellia. A young lady he was involved with left him for another. Maybe it was the Force working then because soon after he had met Master Garet and began this journey.

Tar'ja watches him lift from his position and look past her, ahh that was right....the bothan was still in the room...perhaps this would have been better with no one else around was he embarrassed?
"No Tar'ja you did nothing wrong. For not knowing much about emotions you are very intuitive to them. More so than you may think." That made her smile, she liked compliments of her abilities, praise..she loved praise..it was those few times she did something really well when her 'father' had praised her and she got to pick a new skill to learn, not something she had to learn but something she had wanted to study.
"Your assumption about my feelings are correct. I have fallen for you." Good memories..well..better..memories aside, she was confused again. She looks him over from head to toe; the term was lost to her, "you don't look as though you've taken a fall..." She frowns "how did I make you fall? we've been laying here for a few minutes now.."

He saw her smile at what he said but then noticed the confused look on her face and then it hit him. She had probably never heard the expression he used. He saw her look him up and down. and then innocently she asked her question. "You don't look as though you've taken a fall... How did I make you fall? We've been laying here for a few minutes now.."
His smile widened to probably the biggest grin he had ever given her and he began to chuckle softly. **"It's an expression. One you've never heard before. Yes I've fallen but not to the floor as were here sharing the bunk. I've fallen…in love with you. I think it's been that way ever since we kissed back at the Jawa trade camp. I don't think I ever stood a chance not that I really wanted to."** He added with a sheepish grin. **"You're a remarkable person Tar'ja. you are so much more that what the 'family' trained you to be. I can see it. I hope you can see it too."** He was more relaxed now he had finally said what he wanted to say to her. whatever happened now, happened.
He settled his head into the pillow and sighed, The whole time smiling at her.

Tar'ja turned a light pink, giving her a fuchsia type of color. So he did love her...but all the way back then? how did he know? would she ever know what it was she felt? did she feel something? She liked being around him, he made her smile and laugh; she enjoyed seeing him happy and more so greatly enjoyed that he was teaching her so much...and was even patient..she never could have asked these questions to her 'family' they would have laughed or pushed her away.
"You're a remarkable person Tar'ja. you are so much more that what the 'family' trained you to be. I can see it. I hope you can see it too."
Was she really? Could she be more? was it all just...something they told her to keep her in line? Her pale eyes watched his, as though trying to see the answers that she wanted to questions she didn't know how to ask. "Is that what I feel?" she asked, could he even tell her that? was this something she'd have to figure out on her own? how would she know?

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

He watched her blush again as her eyes watched his. ***What's she thinking?*** He didn't know but he wanted to. He was sure that she had questions but did he have the answer that she was looking for. He had meant what he said about her. She could was so much more than what one saw in front of them. All one needed was to get past the walls she had erected to protect herself.
"Is that what I feel?" She asked searching for an answer to how she felt.
**"You mean love?"** The young Jedi replied to which she nodded.
**"Your feeling for me might be love but I can't answer that question for you. Believe me I would if I could. I can get a general sense of what you're feeling if I try but it's not always definite. It's you who has these feelings when I'm close by or away from you. I can't make you have these feelings for me even though it's how I feel about you."** He was having a hard time. He just bared all to her when he wasn't exactly sure that she felt the same for him.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-07-22 12:07:05)

Tar'ja nods her head slowly, it was her feelings...even if she didn't know what they were. Sighing she closes her eyes for a moment, was she supposed to say the words back to him? would they hold any meaning if she didn't know if that was what her feelings were?
No...no at least this one she knew she shouldn't do, not without knowing this seemed like something important. Opening her eyes she offers him his smile "I hope you will forgive me if..I don't say those words..or..place them to the emotion if I am unsure of it."
Breathing deep, her lekku twitch faintly before she realizes that there was another person in the room and chuckles, whispering to him "we forgot about the bothan."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-07-22 13:20:48)

He watched as she closed her eyes as she thought about what he had just said to her. His own mind was racing. Had he said too much, been too forthcoming and honest. No he hadn't as it was obvious they had feelings for each other. ***Being honest wasn't wrong But it might have been too much, too soon.***
Her eyes opened and she gave him that smile that seemed to only be for him. He smiled back at her as he withheld his use of the Force to sense her feelings. Yet in her eyes he thought he saw confusion and some understanding of their situation. "I hope you will forgive me if..I don't say those words..or..place them to the emotion if I am unsure of it."
He had a feeling something like that was coming. She was smart but these emotions were new to her. To new to her to expect her to place a meaning to what she felt. Still he was disappointed somewhat by her words.
His smile faltered slightly but then came back as he looked into her eyes when she started chuckling. "We forgot about the Bothan."
He looked over her shoulder as saw Dex still there paying them no attention. ***Letting us talk privately or as privately as one can be in a room with others.***
**"I guess we did. Look Tar'ja…"** He said to her as a serious look came across his features. **"There's no need to forgive you. You haven't harmed me. My ego may be banged up but I understand. Understand that you have these emotions and feelings that you don't completely comprehend yet."** He propped himself up on his arm. **"Someday you will."** He added with a smile.
He leaned in and kissed her gently upon the cheek letting his lips brush her soft skin. It wasn't quite the kiss he had in mind, lie the one at the Jawa camp, but this wasn't the time or place for that.
He smiled when he pulled away. ***I can wait.*** He thought to himself.
He indicated Dexter with a nod of his head. **"Come on lets see what he's up to before he gets into trouble."** He gave her that crooked grin as he moved down a bit and placed his feet on the floor. **"So Dexter what have you found out about our accommodations."** He stood up as he talked and offered Tar'ja his hand. **"Shall we?"** He said to her.

Dexter was looking over the Screen in friont of him that was dominating one wall of the room they where given. Thinking to himself.*"I wonder if the access is right…."* He is snapped out of his thoughts by what Chase had said. Turning around. "Oh I was just trying to figure out how this screen works. I have figured out about how far we are from the ship. I think we could make it back there if needed, but I don't think we could take off if we wanted and going anywhere would be some what problem matic considering how long it would take." Dex turns back to the screen looking it over once again. "I know I was out of line earlier and I am sorry. I was just going to step ou for some caf and figure out how to get a better grip on where we are. You are of welcome to join me if you like?" Dexter was just kind of figuring to walk out the front door he figured as long as they didn't cause problems there host would not care to much. He turns and heads for the door. "I wonder if they have a Canteena in here you can always find good iformation there."

<strong>Spiders and Vampires and Succubi&#8230; oh my!</strong>
((( OOC- Please disregard my last post. Reasons include continuity issues. This should align nicely with my 'breakdown' post. <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->) )))
The effect of the sedative was far from restful. This is what would have occurred to Naryen if she had any mental faculties remaining. In a near dream-like state she did hear a very particular "Sir. Yes Sir." that caused her awareness to bob, momentarily, above the somewhat chunky style semi-conscious soup currently filling her brain-pan. What would have been an abrupt "Tom!" came out, instead, as a almost drooling whimper of **"Tum?"**
This was enough, however to start her back to something resembling function, and she became aware that she was being addressed. She tried lifting her head from her knees, now joining her backside in considerably off-tune chorus of "We're real sore and boy are you feeling it", but found the rushing in her ears volunteered some considerable protest. With a pained look, as the muscles in her neck added to the strike currently banging off in her ears, she did manage to level to her... interrogators? and in what would likely go down on their records as the most articulate response they have ever received in their capacity at this Rebel stronghold, Naryen replied with **"Whu?"**
This, of course, would simply not do. Where her little form keeps such reserves could be the subject of some considerable medical debate but a surge of truly annoyed adrenaline registered with a ***Enough of this then!… Was that Thomas?***. With a determined breath, taken with now closed eyes and considerable effort, she then opened her eyes and addresses the only two people left in the room with her, but mainly the male she thinks did just speak to her. **"I'm sorry. The last few weeks have been trying."** she enjoys a brief flash of pride at the sarcasm that managed to wiggle itself out there. **"What changes what then? The before the now and the why for the change please."** A sigh here **"Sorry, I am trying. I will give you every bit of attention I can find in me."** A weak smile from bleary eyes don't seem to convey what the voice promises but it's strength, at that moment, is hard to deny.
A bit of bleary leaves to be replaced with some focus as she considers how she's been used in the past. The rally, started there, was like napalm to a cloud of tabana gas. **"And after you've explained that I'll then ask you to fully detail precisely what you mean by *useful*."** her eyes harden, at that last, and the rest of her features match in short order. The scramble the rest of her faculties made to fall in line would have been comedic to those that didn't pick up the tone of near homicidal rage that crescendoed on that last sentence. That her undivided attention has been brought to bear is hard to refute.

Tar'ja sighs as she takes his offered hand, standing with him to see what the bothan was up to...and just how much trouble he was going to be in for doing it.
"I know I was out of line earlier and I am sorry. I was just going to step out for some caf and figure out how to get a better grip on where we are. You are of welcome to join me if you like?"
A tilt of her head and a faint raise of lekku was the acknowledgment he would be getting for his apologies. Glance over the Jedi at her side, of whoms hand she had yet to release, and raises a brow "would you like to stay and rest or...find some places for food for when Deidra comes back." She looks around "maybe even bring something to hold for her.."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

She took his offered hand and stood as he gave her a small smile. Despite that she could not return the words that he had said to her he knew that she had feelings for him. What they were neither knew and maybe both secretly hoped that they would someday.
Dex apologized for earlier. When he looked at Tar'ja he couldn't say he wasn't surprised that she didn't respond other than giving a slight nod and a twitch of her lekku.
The mention of food from Dexter did spark his interest. He was going to say something but Tar'ja beat him to it. Still holding his hand she raised a brow. "Would you like to stay and rest or...find some places for food for when Deidra comes back." She looked around the room "Maybe even bring something to hold for her.."
Smiling and nodding he agreed. **"Food sounds real good right now. Dex you have a great idea. Anything would be better that the last week of ships rations."** He looked back to Dex who's idea it was. **"Dexter do you want to lead the way?"** He asked the Bothan.
***This way we can keep an eye on you.*** He thought to himself.
He gave Tar'ja's hand a gentile squeeze His mind now on real food. **"I wonder what they have for food on a station like this?"** He said to the two of them.

Soon after Tomas leaves with Kasga the B-1 droid pushes the food cart inside. Leaving the cart behind the droid leaves the room. No guards are left at your door, and the door is left unlocked. Your group seems to have passed at least some level of trust with this faction.
Dexter`s idea of fresh food does sound good though. Your group finds no resistance at all leaving the quarters. Many of the corridors are filled with refugees, you find only select areas within the stations guarded and off limits. The command, weapons and communication areas are well guarded by rebel troops.
With free access to intermittent computer terminals on the walls you easily find your way to one of the closest cantina`s.
Bustling with activity the large room is filled with rebel pilots, troops and refugees all eating and socializing rather loudly.
A single wheeled droid offers to seat and service your group. The droid is polite and to the point "What`s your order today?"
Around your group you pick up bits of conversations here and there.
"Yea we blasted them to bits then left that system in our sensors, another good mission."
"Any mission you fly away from is a good one."
"Here here, lets hear it for Pronto squad!"
"We barely escaped our home world, the empire destroyed whatever they could not capture."
"Enjoy your meal."
You notice the rebels are polite to the refugees, they converse with them but tend to stick together. These people have obviously been through a lot together, the work eat sleep and play as a team.
Kirns quarters
Kasga spends hours in the room falling asleep sometime later in Kirn`s bed. Not even looking to see if Tomas left the room or even if the door was closed.
Waking feeling hungry but refreshed you notice lights coming from the window. The window overlooks a fighter hanger. Inside several headhunters are lined up some with service men and women working repairs. On one side a fighter grabs your eye, similar to the headhunter but longer and wider, sporting more fire power larger engines and an astromech droid port this fighter is new. An X-wing.
For Deidra`s eyes only

Lt So-Majs responds hi voice almost mono tone never showing emotion "We require information on fleet movements, position strengths weakness, imperial bases, anything we can use to turn missions into victories." The Lt pauses looks to Lt Elara Moraal then continues "anything we can use to prevent the empire from massacring more worlds."
Lt Elara Moraal bits her lip then bursts her reply out almost yelling almost crying "We need you on this, don`t let them do what they have done to .... to our home to others. We must fight them any way we can. Will you help us?"

Kasga stands looking at the new fighter for minute. He's impressed by it's minimalist design. Perhaps I'll get to try it out. Food first, then I'll see where everyone else is.
Kasga slumps out of Kirn's room and wanders about until he finds the cantina. His companions having eaten hours before are no where to be seen. Kasga takes a empty seat and begins to eat. Shortly he realizes that he's quite hungry and eats his food with gusto. Finishing up his food, he finds himself quite refreshed, so he wanders over to the barracks housing his companions. Walking in the door, he say, **"Hey, everybody."**

<strong>Spiders and Vampires and Succubi&#8230; oh my!</strong>
Naryen stares at So-Maj. Irritated. Frustrated. ***Are you intentionally being evasive?*** another sigh, still shuddering due to the after effects of her sobs. ***No, you just aren't aware of who you're talking to.*** As she watches his only emotional response, a considerate look to Elara, everything falls into place especially with what he says next and her imagination ravages her mind and memories ***"…massacring more worlds." So it's true then. Everything I had feared and buried in denial. All of it.***
Her face pinches as she opens her mouth to answer but is interrupted by Elaras outburst. She stares back, for a moment, in answer. ***No, you really don't know and you certainly were a civie. So be it.*** She rallies herself further. Thoughts align, training regiments register. Everything her instructors pour into her for years, some to help with being "overly" (read "female") emotional answers her call to focus. She closes her eyes as her center of focus anchors her being **"I will try to make this as clear as I can."**
She opens her eyes and looks to So-Maj, matching his look of cool indifference but the passion in her voice is of dramatic contrast, and speaks to him with all she would use to address a drop-ship packed with troopers and declares, loudly with fists clenched in front of her legs folded to her chest: **"I. Will. Not. Be. Used. Again."** She pauses there, for just a moment, to allow her meaning to start to register before she continues.
**"For me to answer *you* I need to know who *you* are. Who *us* is? To show any justice to any who have died or suffered from what I have, or not, done or will die or suffer for anything I will do, or not do, I need that answered!"** Her eyes well a little and she clenches them shut as she barrels on, shaking. **"I have sworn oaths to protect and serve and my devotion to those oaths have been twisted to compromise everything I and any like me have stood for."** She opens her eyes, defeat of the past and hope for the future and searching for some understanding in the face of the man that seems so devoid of feeling, as she furthers her appeal.
**"What you ask for is short-term, the here and the now."** she slashes away with one hand while gripping a leg with the other in a dismissing gesture **"Useless! All of it! Mist and lies and everything that was used against me and will be used against you and any that seek so short-term a solution!"** She draws her hand back, now more relaxed. **"None of it the 'what will be' and the 'next' and *that* is what is needed to face this!"** Naryen opens her eyes and looks to So-Maj, again. **"And *that* Lieutenant, is what you need."**
She sighs again and looks to the floor between them. **"For me to know you, so I can give you an informed answer that doesn't dishonor everyone and everything lost is this war,"** She begins shakes with effort as she pulls further on her reserves to continue, ***Don't stop now. Go! Push! Show them where they err!*** **"I must know your point of view, what you see and have seen, so that I may know you. I have not had this as an Imperial Officer either shrouded from me or by me."**
She looks up to him **"Show me what you have about my home. Show me what the Empire said was done and by whom. Show me what you say you oppose so I may know myself and I can answer you!"** Again having spent so much of herself she pushes on even further, though it's clear she's taxing herself greatly.
Naryens body and voice shakes as she continues but she pushes on **"Please! Show me what I've asked of you so I may give you an informed answer your question. To do otherwise is to lie and the galaxy deserves better and I'm tired of lies."** With wide, pleading eyes. **"Please just show me what you claim to face so I can see if I can face it with you!"** She looks to the floor where she imagines the image of her dead parents. **"The dead and dying demand it and so must I."**
Again looking back to his face with a final appeal. **"Please!"** It seems like the last of her strength, but she's already show she is capable of far more. The question remains ***If what I suspect to be true, is, then are these the people to stop it and can I join them? Answer!***

Dexter leads his Friends through the station. They where in luck there was a cantiana on the station. As they walk in they are greeted by the same friendly atmosphere that is on the rest of the station. If they where running for there lives you really couldn't tell. They follow the serving driod to a table and are seated. " Yes my good Sir. I would like a nice Ale and Bantha burger and tubers, Thank You." Looking at his friends. "Some Ales for my friends as well." Dexter smiles. He opens himself up to room looking around for a good information sources in the room.

With it decided that some food sounded good they three of them made ready to go. Chase looked at Tar'ja. She still held his hand and in that matter he wasn't going to complain one bit. As they opened the door no guards stood in place to keep them inside. The young Jedi nodded to himself.
**"This is good. No guards means that they trust us to some extent. This will allow us to roam somewhat free."** As they walked only certain areas were still off-limits. Critical areas such as the command center, weapons and communications areas. When they came across an computer terminal Dexter was quick to bring up a layout of the area. Quickly he found a suitable place for them to get some food.
Upon entering the Cantina Chase was greeted with all sorts of sounds and emotions to go with it. He quickly closed himself off to the other patrons while trying to leave himself open to any possible danger that may be around him. It was an effort but he thought he had succeeded at the attempt.
Led to a table by a service droid Chase took a seat next to Tar'ja. Dex was quick to order as the Bothan did so Chase was able to over hear some of the conversations going on around them. It seemed that the operations were wide spread and of the hit and run type. It made sense. The Rebellion didn't have the personnel or the ships to go head to head with the Imps.
He noticed that Dexter had ordered drinks for everyone so Chase only ordered some food to go with it. He would have liked a large Bantha steak but figured that would be nect to impossible way out here. **"Same as him. Cook mine medium well please."**
He looked around again. Refugees were scattered around among the rebel troops, pilots and grunts. Some intermingled some stayed with who they came in with. **"Its amazing. It seems like that have been pretty successful running out of this base of operations. No doubt its location has something to do with it. No wonder its secrecy is so important to them."**
He thought of Deidra then and looked at Tar'ja. **"What should we get for Deidra? I have no idea what she would like."**

Tar'ja held tight to the Jedi's hand, moving in along with them silently as she took note of her surroundings. Granted she was looking to see if she might be able to find where their friend was being held, however with little luck as it were finding their way was a better option.
Taking a seat beside Chase the twi'lek glances around the room, half paying attention to the extent of knowing they had ordered food and drinks but little else. She had been listening as she watched the groups enter; paying attention to the social workings of the room and the courteous air the rebellion soldiers were giving those that had found refuge here.
"Its amazing. It seems like that have been pretty successful running out of this base of operations. No doubt its location has something to do with it. No wonder its secrecy is so important to them." Chase said, and the female had to agree with him. True it didn't seem like they had much to fight the empire but with what they had they were trying...it was an interesting aspect to see that glimmer in the eyes of those refuges in the Cantina that looked to the soldiers with that...hope..thing. That was good she supposed.
"What should we get for Deidra? I have no idea what she would like." Blinking pale blue hues turn back to the jedi's own blue ones in confusion; her mind reeled back to recall she hadn't ordered anything and they were planning to bring something back for their friend. Frowning the twi'lek turns to the droid "Just bring me something hot and filling, and second of the same to go."
She glances back to the Jedi and Bothan "that should be enough yes? filling and hot is better than what we've had."

At Naryen`s words Lt Elara Moraal throws her hands up into the air and slams them down on the table. "Are you daft! Have you not been listening .... "
Lt So-Majs calmly stops her outburst again with only words "Lt Moraal that will get us no where." Lt So-Majs taps on a com link "Sir I regret to inform you of our lack of progress. Perhaps the subject will be more receptive in a few days, over."
There is no response, the two Lts wait Lt So-Majs holding eye contact with you while Lt Elara Moraal paces back and forth. As you listen to Lt Elara Moraal heavy, upset breathing you begin to wonder if this is some kind of tactic to get you to talk. As if to play on the tactic Lt So-Majs opens the com again, obviously not use to such a wait from his commanding officer. "Sir did you copy, sir?"
The answer does not come from the com but the door. The door opens light from the corridor blinding you briefly. As your sight returns Lt Tomas has returned, this time armed and flanking a tall Neimodain, leaning heavily on one good leg the other is a mechanical appendage. The Neimodain wheres a tan rebel officer uniform which sports the red rebel insignia. over his tan uniform he wears a long open brown robe. "Yes Lt So-Majs I copy." All three Lts salute in unison to the Neimodain.
The Neimodain looks down on you for a moment then speaks. "I am Captain Runn of the house Runn. Welcome to Port Eclipse." The Neimodain bows in your direction. "You want to know who we are and what we do. Come see for yourself."
Lt So-Majs stands and begins to protest "But sir! We have not finished the debriefing she could be ..."
Lt Elara Moraal finishes the sentence "an imperial spy." She spits on the ground as she mutters the words.
Captain Runn merely smiles "And if she is then her training is well beyond the means of us to gather any intel by this method. Come all of you." The captain walks to the door Lt Tomas still flanking. You notice Tomas look your way a little longer then expected, trying to figure you out? Or maybe he is just not use to seeing you so broken.
Lt So-Majs and Lt Elara Moraal walk behind you while Lt Tomas and Captain Runn walk in front. They take you through several corridors and lifts, this place is big.
Captain Runn waves at a few children as the lift door opens. "I could show you the many victories we have taking against your empire." Captain Runn pauses looking at you for some kind of reaction then continues. "We have fought against the empire since before its creation. I could show you all that but this is the real victory." Captain Runn motions to the large common room with his outstretched hand.
Throughout the room many families men women children play, rest generally go about their daily routine. You notice many of the humans in the group are pale of complexion, most wear the latest fashion of your home world.
As if to answer your thoughts Captain Runn continues "These are the survivors of Varlbrindal, many rescued by LT Tomas himself." Tomas turns a little red at that, he was never one for the center of attention. "You wanted to know what we do who we are, only you can see that and judge for yourself LT Naryen Fae."
The large common room over looks other common rooms some lower through this section of the station. All the rooms are full of Varlbrindal refugees easily numbering into the thousands.

</details>

The droid responds to Dexters order "Ale Bantha burger and tubers coming your way!" The droid nods to Chase at his addition to the order "Three orders, Ale Bantha burger one medium well and tubers coming your way honey."
Dexter sits for moment listening to the conversations around them. Everyone seems friendly enough a few even nod in your direction. Others are ordering or eating many are chatting, pilots talk of past victories and of more to come, refugees talk concerned of what will hapen to them. Six members of Pronto squad sit at the table closest to yours.
The droid rolls off towards the serving area. Your group sits and waits while the cantina`s chatter rumbles on.
Tar`ja feels a suden pull on one of her lekku. Not sure what to expect but fearing the worst Tar`ja spins around to meet this sudden assault.
Looking down you see a small red headed human girl. Her mother quickly pulls her away "Sasha what did I tell you about bothering others."
The child responds in a whine "but mom, she is so pretty."
"Sasha!" The girls name spoken in a snap is enough to make the little girl retreat to her own table. Watching the little girl and the other children on board you can not help but to think of Dosennaa`s farm.
After a tasty meal your group wonders back to the barracks. There is little sense of time on board a station but you notice many others preparing for bed, while most children have already gone to bed. It must be getting late. Shortly after returning to the barracks Kasaga enters walking in the door, he say, "Hey, everybody."

It was strange being on a ship this large, so much activity and yet that feeling that it was okay to relax was pressing into her mind, not something she wanted but it was there and becoming harder to resist.
A sudden tug at her lekku had her senses on alert, she hated people doing that to gain attention, it was degrading and it hurt if it was too hard; prepairing herself to take on whoever it was that had the misfortune to tug on the wrong lekku she turns...to find a child.
Blinking at the girl she listened to the conversation, she must have been ignoring the children in the area as now she was all too aware of them...she missed her lyn..
Before the pair left the twi'lek managed a soft "it's alright." to the mother, she didn't want the girl to get in trouble...that wasn't right, she was curious. Sighing the woman turns back to her company, lekku twitching, the left more so then the right to get into a comfortable position.
The food came, and conversation was little as they eat, she ordered another bantha burger for Deidra to go and made her way with the others back to their small room. Taking a seat on one of the beds she sets the food on the one nearest as a saved spot. Glancing up she nods to the returning member "did you find all you needed?"

The three of them sat there waiting for their food to arrive. He kept looking around taking in the area. There were many families in the cantnia eating. More so than he would have figured. ***Maybe this isn't just a military instillation like we thought. There's more going on her than we realize.***
Through the Force he felt a rise in anger as if one was ready to fight. Looking to his left he saw Tar'ja looking at a little red haired girl. The anger he had felt so sharply had already began to fade only to be replaced with something else as the young girl spoke about Tar'ja being pretty. He smiled as he heard his friend tell the mother it was alright but he doubted it would have much affect. Hopefully the child would get away with just a scolding.
When she turned back around he was smiling at her. When she raised an eyebrow he chuckled a bit. **"Kids have a habit of being inquisitive and very truthful without realizing it."** He felt the shift in her emotions again. Not wanting to be intrusive he again made the effort to close himself off a bit so he didn't easily pick up on the others that were around them.
The food was filling. Much more so than the ships rations that had been consuming for the last week. Another plate was ordered for Deidra and they set back off to the room that was set aside for them. He took the bed next to the one Tar'ja sat on after she placed the food on the nearby bunk that Deidra would soon call her own.
The door opened up and Kasga walked in, "Hey, everybody." The Duros said in what seemed a relaxed tone. Chase waited for the pilots answer to Tar'ja's question on what he found.

Kasga feels more settled now that he's eaten. Tar'ja's question reminded him of all that he had already lost. Kirn, his reputation, his livelyhood were gone. He tears his mind away from the paths he had recently walked down. His chest expands as he sighs, **"Well, not everything."** He gestures down the hallway, **"You can come take a look if you want. Kirn definitely lived and worked here."**

<strong>Spiders and Vampires and Succubi&#8230; oh my!</strong>
((( OOC- Nice! )))
Naryen stares at the newcomer clothed much like Chase and exuding a virtual textbook verse of a particular section of her training. The composure and tone are different than So-Majs. Where his is the impassive calm of an inquisitor or politician Runns is serene, peaceful with a knowing look and insightful eyes. The reaction is emotionally violent and, thankfully, somewhat expected even in her weakened state as it manifests in her mind like a shriek of the terror that follows it.
***Jedi!***
Her senses rally after the runaway thought, and the fear it leaves in it's wake, and some focus is established. She thinks of what she was told about Jedi and compares that to her experience with Chase. ***No. Those were likely lies as well. Remain open!*** Then she sees Thomas and her emotions quiver in an unexpected direction but she focuses on the Neimodains directions and how the others react.
Naryen wastes no time to follow his directions and she uses her training to clear her mind so she misses nothing. ***Perhaps now we can have some sense?*** Her awareness drifts back to her annoyance and frustration with So-Maj and Moraal and she sighs inwardly at her failure to communicate with them, thou she is at a loss for what else she could have said or done.
As the lift doors open she is assailed with sights and sounds that register familiar almost instantly. The pangs of longing register shortly after. Accents. Slang. Even the occasional whiff of a familiar incense or food. Clothing. Body language. Skin tone. It all seeps through her filters and it's all she can do not to gasp out-loud.
Runns comment about *her* Empire snaps at her. ***Whatever he meant by that you'll be able to answer him soon. Patience! It's here! Listen!***
As they walk she, again, employs a breathing technique as she tunes out the words of all the people around them. Removing the particulars, the details, she searches for the truth she had asked for in the commonality, the undercurrent of those around her. And she hears it! The one thing she had asked for jumps out. The laughter, the casual conversation, the occasional argument and even the play of the children. It was there, she could feel it!
Naryen feels a surge of pride and deep gratitude towards Thomas when Runn says that he saved many of the people, her people, and she looks to him. And turns away in embarrassment as she compares his strength and confidence and her lack.
When they stop she steps away from the others and stands there, turning her attention back the thousands there with her and lets it all wash into her mind. Watching their faces. Listening to their voices. She closes her eyes and holds her hands to her mouth, that trembles under her fingers. She again, blocks out the details and looks to the pattern presented by the thousands that don't even know she exists and reads it back to herself. From them, she gets fear, shock, loss, betrayal and from them, directed to their surroundings, she feels hope and gratitude. Tears flow from her closed eyes. She starts to step, slowly, around in place, tilting her head to catch every nuance. Hearing life from those that escaped death her hands fall from her mouth to clasp at her chest, feeling her heart pound with the energy of revelation.
***These are refugees. They find refuge here, in Port Eclipse, with Runn. There's no doubt.***
A deep seeded part of her mind shakes a final burst of protest and falls away from her core, evaporating like mist on the wind. She opens her eyes, now facing Runn, and finds she shares the gratitude directed at Thomas with the Captain.
With a weak smile, and her hands still at her chest **"*My* Empire, it seems, exists only in my mind."** She pauses as the truth of it begins to ring in her mind. She harnesses that an uses it to bolster her forward. With a step back to Runn, gripping her hands tighter, she pleads with him and thanks him deeply. **"I can see it, hear it, feel it. I asked to see who you and you showed me! I asked and this is more an answer than I had hoped."** She shakes with the effort. **"Please. I need to face this. Now! Grant me my other request. Show me what the Empire says happened to my home. I feel like I've been fed lies my whole life and now that I feel this close to tasting truth, maybe for the first time, don't hold it back from me now. Please! Show me what The Empire is saying about Varbrindal!"**
She stares at him, desperate for the chance to face her other great obstacle, and waits with more hope than she can stand. ***Please!***

Tar'ja shakes her head to the duros, motioning over to the only empty bed not protected by food. "That's private. Those types of emotions and feelings that flow through that room are yours. It's memories to you, it wouldn't have that effect to us...only that someone that was lived there wasn't using it now."
It was the same before, something that had been atempted to be taught to her that she had done her best in resisting. Objects were Objects, don't put meaning and emotion into them of they can be used against you. There was only so much a young mind can take, and that was not something that had been able to pass through.
Her 'brother' one of the family that had been nice to her on occasion, before they had gotten wind of it and sent him away...or killed him..she still wasn't sure which. Had given her, her first and only toy a plush Jax toy he said had reminded him of her. She didn't know what that meant but didn't really care, she had a toy, something normal children in the streets had.
When he had been 'sent away' they tried to prove that holding emotion to a thing would be dire in the end; they took it, shook it, and threatened to burn it. the young twi'lek went in a near frenzy to get it back; in the end, they had torn it and shredded it before tossing it away. If she really thought about it, that was the start of their downfall.
Blinking and bringing her mind back she nods to the Duros "all the same...are you alright? seeing the room must have been difficult."

Chase listened as Tar'ja responded to the Duros. He raised an eyebrow at her response. It seemed a little cold. Like dismissing the feelings that he experienced in his brothers room. True the room would not have the same effect on the rest of them as it did on Kasga it was maybe the companionship he was looking for. ***I wonder if that outlook has something to do with her childhood? There's still so much to discover about her.***
He nodded to Kasga. **"I'll stop by later to see who your brother was. Right now I'm beat. We still don't know when Deidra will show up. She could be anywhere. This stations is enormous. We managed to grab some food at the cantina. Apparently they also run a full military operation out of here along with taking care of refugees from where ever that havven to come from. Some of the chit chat was from some members of…"** He thought about it for a second. **"Pronto Squad."**
He looked between the three that were there as he laid back onto the bunk and placed his hands behind his head and crossed his legs at the ankles to make himself as comfortable as possible. **"It sounded like they are doing some good work here."**

Dexter takes the info that he had gathered which was not a lot and heads back to there room with his friends. When they get back they all settle in and relax. A good meal always had that effect on people. After a while Kasga had returned to the room from his brothers room. He talked to Tar'ja and about somethings he had found there. Dex chose to keep his mouth shut and listen instead of speck. He also puts together the information that he had gathered. People here seemed up beat and positive. Even with having to leave there homes and friends behind. This place had become something of a community of people that had been displace by the Empire. Dexter was looking forward to what working for these people and helping anyway he can.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **galenbd** (2010-08-07 21:40:20)

Tar'ja's response is alternately a slap and caress. Still a woman that kills her family is likely to have some attachment difficulties. Kasga composes himself. **"I am better. Seeing that he was here did help. He was alive when our formation broke. After that…"**, Kasga shrugs.
Kasga continues, **"It's definitely a military organization. My questions are mostly about true motivations. I don't know Pronto Squad, but the Reapers enjoyed a bit of a reputation around here. The way Kirn described the Rebellion, having refugees around is not surprising. It's not like the Empire doesn't make lots of them."**
**"If you're tired, why don't you catch some sleep? I just got some sleep, so I'll be exploring the flight deck. You should be able to find me out there when you get up."**

### **master_Tru** (2010-08-09 19:00:46)

Your group enjoys a much needed rest. The barrack beds are firm and lacking pillows but still better then the sparse conditions of the ship.
While the group settles in for sleep Kasga heads for the hanger bay his brothers room over looked. Entering the bay you realize that the room only overlooks part of the flight deck. In addition to the headhunter fighters you see a wing of six Y-wings.
The Y-wings are marked Pronto squad, the individual ships marked with their pilots names. Capatin Terran, Lt Lefex, Lt Rar, Lt Felswoop, Lt Caho and one is labeled only Drex. All the Y-wings are in well maintained shape and all have kill scores painted on the sides, mostly Tie fighters. Captain Terran fighter sports the highest kill count at over twenty.
The Headhunters are labeled Green squad, they have no names labeling ownership. This wing is most likely rotated through several pilots, and probably used is station defense. As you walk through a few service droids motor here and there, the couple service men working on the headhunters are too busy to notice you enter the hanger.
When you get to the X-wing you notice its smooth lines. There is only one it has no markings on it. When you step up to look inside the cockpit you realize why, its not finished. They must be constructing the X-wings by hand, this one looks nearly finished only missing a few console computers and testing.
As you examine the ship a voice behind you calls out "Hey what are you? Oh your Kirns little bro." Turning you see a slightly over weight human dressed in service maintenance overhauls wearing a tool belt around his waist. "I am Sam Caho, you can call me Sammy Krin and his boys always did. So what do you think of the X-wing?"
The Barracks
While Chase sleeps, or try`s to even so tired the mans thoughts are distracted. Chase slowly begins to nod off to sleep, dreams come to the jedi tonight dreams of lessons with his former master.
"You lack focus young one, your focus needs more focus." The master sits eyes closed floating over a small river, while you look up to him soaked having fallen into the river trying the same lesson.
"Yes master." Silently you pick yourself up out of the river, standing on the rocks you drip water everywhere evidence of your failed attempt at levitation. For a moment you try to compose yourself, practicing the breathing techniques taught to you while your master continues to levitate over the rivers water.
"Master are there many of us."
"That depends on what you mean by us Chase." Your master replies.
"You know people who use the force, are there many of us?" You where so innocent back then.
"There are fewer of us now then before. Too few these days."
"So there are not that many who know the force anymore master?"
"There are many who know of the force young one, though not all are jedi. It might surprise you to know that many who use the force call it by many names. When we reach the next system I will give you access to the libraries you can research some of the different force traditions out there."
Tar`ja finds it difficult to sleep. Soo many thoughts running through her head, thoughts of the orphans, who they where dealing with, what happened to Deidra.
Looking to talk out these feelings you decide to wake Chase. When you try to his snoring mixed with "Yes ... master, no master." Curious what ever could he be dreaming of?
Deciding not to wake the jedi you toss and turn restless in your worries. Tired of that you get up intent on a walk, perhaps you might learn something new on this ship after hours. Quietly you walk to the door hoping not to wake anyone. When door opens you slip outside.
Making sure the door is closed behind you hear a voice behind you "Why up so late mon cheri?"
Turning you see a green skinned Twilik wearing a red pilots jump suite with the rebel insignia on one side and the words Pronto squad on the other.
For Deidra`s eyes only
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

At Deidra`s request Captain Runn stands silently for a moment. You notice Tomas look down at the floor on the mention of Varbrindal. With a raised eyebrow Runn replies "What you seek will bring you only more lies." The Captain looks into your eyes for a moment. "I can see that you are determined, do not say that I did not warn you. You will not like what you see."
The four escort you out of the area through more corridors and lifts finally to a small auxiliary command center. Inside and out even this secondary command position is well guarded. Inside computer consoles line the walls all displaying various sensor reading mostly of the Gas giants atmosphere.
Captain Runn moves to the closest terminal and with a few key presses brings up a video feed. The feed is an imperial news broadcasted within the core worlds. The headlines read Rebel Traitors sack Varbrindal. The video shows the capital city in ruins, building leveled craters throughout the landscape. The broadcast goes on to state the worlds loses at total. The empire calls on a need for more able bodied men and women willing to rise up and prevent future massacres at the rebellions hands. Before the broadcast ends it flashed two wanted pictures, the first of a Twilek woman you recognize as Tar`ja the second is your own.

Tar'ja sighs as sleep could not come to her she could not continue to simply lay awake..it was doing her no good. Turning she looks towards Chase "Chase...Chase." "yes...master. no master." She frowns strange dream..
Sighing the twi'lek moves from her lump of a bed and to the door, closing it quietly behind her only to nearly jump from her skin "Why up so late mon cheri?" When had she let her guard down so much. Her hand instinctively moved to her hip where her weapon should have been to remember too late she was unarmed.
Sighing again she takes a moment to calm herself before turning to the speaker, imagine her surprise when the speaker was no other than one of her own kind. and a male at that! go figure. Eying him a moment she speaks "Too many thoughts. Sleep is unwilling to come to me this night." She frowns faintly and eyes the insignia a moment then back to his features "I could ask you the same...Pronto squad."

### **Yogi** (2010-08-11 01:03:56)

AS Chase lay back on the cot he didn't realize how tired he was. With his hands behind his head he began to drift off. Before long and in the company of the others a slight snoring begins to emanate from the young Jedi. With a small unflattering snort he rolled over to face the bulkhead and used his arm as a makeshift pillow. It was in that position that he fell into a deeper restless sleep. Where vivid dreams of his master came to him. Reliving old training sessions.
"You lack focus young one, your focus needs more focus." He was always hearing that from Garet even when he was doing his best.
**"Yes Master."**
That evening Chase had gotten a lesson from Garet on other traditions that also used the Force. There were many and he was looking forward to the next system that reached so his study on them could continue.
"Remember Chase to check over your lightsaber to make sure it's in good working order."
**"Yes Master, Yes Master. I will."** Garet had always been after him to make sure his lightsaber was always in good working condition.
It was then he thought he felt someone touching him. "Chase...Chase." The voice sounded like Tar'ja's. He looked around but didn't see her. It was when he was looking around that Garet poked his head around the corner.
"Again your focus lacks focus Chase." His head whipped back around his face reddened as he had been caught again by his master not paying attention.
**"Master how do you…how do you know who I was looking for."**
Garet smiled. **"Young Chase through the Force we can see and experience many things. Only your lack of training and disbelief, that you can also do it, prevents you from doing so."**
**"Then yo know who she is?"** He asked.
Garet nodded. "And that's why I say your focus lacks focus."
Chase frowned a bit. **"Master I care for her. I think she does for me also but she doesn't understand those feelings. It's a long complicated story."** He said with some frustration.
Garet nodded and sat down. "Be mindful of your feelings Chase." Garet had left out "young" it was then he knew Garet was was being especially serious. "Lest they be used and turned against you by the empire and Vader. Or by those that would conspire to use you for their own gain. Great potential you have Chase you just have yet to realize it." Garet didn't tell him to stop his current path with Tar'ja. The wizened Jedi understood the Orders view on relationships but he didn't always agree with it. Especially now.
Garet stood and motioned to the lightsaber that sat on the bed in front of his padawan. See to your lightsaber, that weapon is your life. Then get some sleep you look quite tired. Chase did as he was told. When finished he settled down on his bed. He was tired and sleep came quickly. A slight snore escaped as he rolled over and used his arm as a make shift pillow.
Later on he woke up. Stretching out his tall frame on the small bunk he sat up and looked around. **"That was a weird dream Chase."**

### **ganthet** (2010-08-12 16:32:34)

Dexter had fallen asleep at the table in the room. He was working on collecting his thoughts, his data pad was out and he had written down some note to help him remember so facts of what was going on around him. He had the same dream he always had. He was cursed to relive the night his parents died over and over. He had run away at his mothers order, but he always blamed himself for what had happened.
He awakes with a stiff back and neck. It was not the first time he had to fallen asleep at a desk or in a chair. Part of what he did, made this a useful skill to have. He noticed that Chase was asleep still, and Tar'ja was up as well, but see was not in the room. Kasga was out somewhere. Collecting his thoughts maybe, he had some personal things to work through and give the last time he tried to help with his friends personal problems almost cost him his life. Tar'ja was beautiful, and very dangerous, he really thought she was going to kill him there on the spot.
He looks over at the beds then at his crono. It was midnight and Chase was the sleeping soundly. After the round of fit full sleep he was not going to get anymore rest for a while, maybe a walk would do him some good. Besides it would be interesting to see the station at night when everything is calm and quite. Maybe the Cantaina was still open a drink may calm his nerves and help him sleep. He collects his data pad and heads out the door of there quarters.
((OCC: Dex is basically going to wonder the station for a bit, maybe head to the cantaina for a drink if it is still open.))

<strong>Spiders and Vampires and Succubi&#8230; oh my!</strong>
Naryen held her determined stance and, once more, Runn answered her but this time at a cost. She could feel her reserves running low. She had never tapped herself so deep for so long. She followed Runn, staring at the floor behind him as they went, is a dreamlike daze with her surroundings swirling together in a smear of rushing sensations tangled and tugging at her like quicksand. She used the presence of Tomas as strength. When they arrived she had a moment where she almost fell over from fatigue.
As she watched Runn at a terminal, apparently calling up what she asked for, a feeling of dread called out to her from the recesses of her mind. Some part of her knew what was coming and wanted no part of it. Naryen suddenly found herself with energy to spare and she put it to use.
And shackled that part of her mind in place. ***No you don't! Face it! Show them what we're made of.*** A mask of terror and weariness pinned in place with twin shards of melt-less ice. They fix, unblinking to the screen.
"...Rebel Traitors sack Varbrindal..." Her mouth shapes a breathless cry as some part of her mind strains against bonds and shrivels under the onslaught. The sights were shot from angles to elicit the most emotional response, dramatic cutting. It was perfection in it's presentation and purpose. To manipulate the masses.
What is shown, and heard, echoes into her senses. Over and over. The words sound, again and again, with their meanings calling louder and louder. "Varbrindal". *Pain*. "Traitors".*Rage* "Varbrindal". *Pain*. "Traitors".*Rage*. Again and again.
**"… Traitors sack Varbrindal…"** She comes back, realizing that the clip had stopped some time ago and she had been standing there, staring and muttering since. Her eyes were dry this time, perhaps cried out, perhaps just no longer seeing the point. She had been breathlessly muttering those three words, then louder each time, until the sound of her voice registered in her own ears and she realized what it meant to her.
Truth and the silence of the final protest.
The chaos of her face had slowed down, somewhat, but here she closes her eyes and pulls her strained hands apart, away from her chest. With a single cleansing breath she casts her expression back to one of calm, like many ripples being canceled out but a far greater one leaving calm in it's wake. She looks to Runn with eyes of tremendous strength that defies everything else about her in that moment wearing a calm, almost serene, smile.
**"No. Not lies. You were mistaken."** a long blink and her tongue tries desperately to wet her lips. **"This is truth."** Her breathing is slow, determined, focussed. **"I was there when the order was given by the Empire to end Varbrindal. I brought record of it with me. Authenticated. Encrypted and source verified."** A long blink, as she breathed in the strength she needed to continue. **"Traitors sacked Varbrindal but they were Imperial, not Rebel. The proof is already in your possession."** Another long blink, this time with a waver of balance.
**"You've asked for my help and now the answer is simple."** She slowly assumes her officers posture, calling upon all the many resources within her. Her shoulders straighten, her head held high with a clarity of purpose the likes of which she couldn't recall feeling before that moment. Clasping her hands gently behind her back she speaks with projection and strength she didn't know she had left in her. **"I am Varbrindi!"**
She paused there, for a moment. Then, as if to translate, she looked to Lt Elara Moraal and in a conversation tone and expression that says *Why wouldn't I?* and a confused look of *How could you ever have doubted it?* Naryen says **"Of course I'll help."**
With an oddly slanted smile, her eyes blank and her bones head to the floor with her flesh following like an empty sack. She is unconscious long before she even begins to crumble and dreams of purple safety.
((( OCC- Not wanting to be overly dramatic, I felt this was quite appropriate. She has been over taxing herself for weeks and to be at a place of stability for likely the first time in her life, well, she was recently drugged after all. )))

The Twi`lek pilot laughs when you label him Pronto squad. "Mon cheri, you can call me Rar, Kel Rar." Kel ecohes his name in your native language with a sly motion of his lekku. With a slight bow Kel winks at you. "I am on duty mon cheri . We are shipping out this very night, many need rescuing or in this case escort. " Kel notices your instinctive defensive posture. "Well duty calls I must be going mon cheri." Kel bows again and moves to towards the nearest lift.
Turning back the pilot states, "If you be needing to clear your head take a walk on the outter corridors. Be clearing your head by the beautiful view mon cheri." The lift opens and Kel gives you a wink as the door closes leaving you in the corridor alone.
Chase wakes to a dark barracks, Tar`ja is missing but Dexter is gathering his belongings at the rooms table. When Dexter opens the door both the light from the corridor and Tar`ja greet him.
The Hanger
Sammy shakes your hand an laughs "No not my idea." Sammy looks over at the X-wing. "No these snubs are a work of art. As sturdy as a headhunter, with the power of a Y-wing and as fast and agile as a N-1." Sammy lets out a whistle as he brags about the X-wing.
Sam reaches for a few tools and climbs inside the cockpit. You can hear Sammy making adjustments inside as he continues to talk. "We used these against the empire in the battle of Yavin. Luke Skywalker flew one and used it to blow up something called a death star. Big as a moon some say it was."
More adjustments are made. "So are you a pilot too? Kirn always said he taught you everything you knew. If that's true you must be a good pilot!"
For Deidra`s eyes only

Captain Runn looks down for a moment, Tomas stands there looking down on you as you sit in the chair. The recording stops to your relief but the room falls silent.
The Captain looks to Tomas with a smile "You where right." Looking back to you Runn continues "I am sorry for what we have put you through. We run a very sensitive operation here, we could not afford to take chances."
Lt Elara Moraal smiles at you tears welling in her eyes. For a moment she try`s to gather the words but can not. She just hugs you and holds yo for a moment. "We are Varbrindi, we both are."
Lt So-Majs moves to the door, opening it he addresses the captain. "Sir I would request ... better accommodations for our guest." At the mention of guest Lt So-Majs motions to you.
Runn nods "I agree, Naryen take a good nights sleep. We will have to debrief you but it can wait until morning. At some point tomorrow you can meet up with your friends again." The three salute the captain. "Tomas escort Naryen to something more accountable."
"Sir yes Sir!" Tomas replies. Weird you think to yourself. You have heard Tomas bark that very same reply hundreds of times before, but this time it is different. Tomas motions to the door "This way sir."

As Dexter walks out of the room he is greeted by Tar'ja. "Hello. I am just heading out for some air and stretch my legs little. Night Tar'ja." Dexter continues on his way.
A little ways further down the corridor Dexter takes in what is around him. He seems to be alittle more at ease with his surroundings. *"?Yes I can defiantly can see myself here helping these people. Galaxy is a strange place in deed."*  Thinking to himself. Dexter's life had him traveling from one place to another. For the time he wanted to stay some where. It was a strange feeling for him. He keeps walking looking around the station seeing what is there. Looking for the little quite place, secrets that these places always had. Places where kids play or hide from there parents when they are in trouble with there parents. Places where you can be alone with your thoughts.
He spends a a few hours just wondering the station. No real destination in mind at all. Just seeing what was there. He felt like a child seeing the wider galaxy for the first time. Realizing that there was more out there past the front door of his home. It was truly what he enjoyed when the galaxy was trying to kill him.
((OCC: Basically Dex is just kind of wondering around. Pointed himself in a direction a started walking.))

Tar'ja was intrigued, she couldn't remember the last time she had met another twi'lek though...what the hell was wrong with his eye? and what was a mon...mon...cherry? Very confused but glad for the suggestion of place she gives the male a nod as he leaves before glancing to the bothan.
Silent she simply turns from him to move to the corridors and look to the outer view while clearing her head.
Her thoughts were a jumble. Strange speaking twi'leks with odd twitches, unnameable feelings that might have a name but she didn't know if it applied...a worry for her little one and the one that she was beginning to think would be..a sister? in this strange family like unit? Was that the right term? the only knowledge she had fully of a family was being enslaved and told what to do and how to think...but she knew that not all units were like that..she saw them! so were those families? were they now a family?
Sighing the twi'lek woman takes pause, looking out to the view beyond was she alright though? had they hurt her? when would she be returned to them? holding her hands behind her back the woman looks to her own reflection a moment before focusing again outward "She's alive...she'd be too stubborn to die on us."

Kasga looks over the X-wing as Sammy brags about it. He comments retorically, **"Death Star! What a name."**
As Sammy works on the starship, Kasga responds, **"Yes, I trained as a pilot. Kirn got in before me. Flying with him after that put me ahead of my classmates. I used that as much as I could. I was never as inspired a pilot as Kirn. He used to lecture me about how I had to be part of the ship. I tended to consider them like a seperate entity to be cared for, like a pet. "**
He looks over the parts still to be installed. **"I'd be happy to help, but I don't know the specs. Can I look them over? "**

In the dark room Chase raises his head looking around. It's dark in the room but he is able to see Dexter there gathering a few things. Still a bit tired the young Jedi remains quiet as Dexter begins moving towards the door. ***Just as well. I think we would all benefit from sometime alone.*** When the door opens up shedding light into the room he looks. Tar'ja is there as Dex walks quickly past. He was about to call out to her but as the door began to close he managed to see her turn and walk away. ***Yeah some time along would do me some good.***
Standing up an heading towards the refresher he cleans up a bit. His face is rough from many days worth of beard growth. He knows he needs to shave but could care less at the moment. Running a hand over the stubble and turning around he made for the exit.
The light from the hallway was bright compared to the relative darkness of the room. Having two directions to choose from he chose left and followed the corridor as it went. He came across more of what they had seen earlier. Not consulting a terminal he let the Force guide him through the station. Despite his body telling him that it was nighttime the station was busy. Rebel troops and refugees walked the corridors.
Opening himself up to the Force he felt the emotions of the people around him. Sadness, despair, overwhelming grief all reached out to him. But what was sruprising him the most were the two thing he wasn't expecting to feel so strongly. Hope and pride. Hope from the refugees that had found their way here and pride from the troops of a job or mission well done. Feeling reassured that he was in the right place he continued to walk in whatever way he was led.
What he found next simply stopped him in his tracks. Looking out at the expanse he saw thousands of refugees. The area was simply enormous as it made Chase rethink on just how big the station really was. Stepping carefully he walked into the quagmire of people that were amassed here. Staying close to the outer wall he walked. Families were abundant. Some were still intact,some weren't. Exchanging greetings he found out that there were more than a handful that were from Deidra's home world of Varbrindal. He began wondering if she even knew that many of her people were here. Many were asleep though with the amount of people in the area.
Having only wandered a hundred feet or so he stopped. Looking around he felt many of the feeling her felt before emanating form the people massed here. He heard a giggle as a small ball hit his foot as it rolled. Looking down he saw two small children. A boy and a girl, Twins from the looks of it, coming towards him. Smiling he knelt down and picked up the ball and rolled it between his hands. Seeing them surprised him. Despite being here their eyes were bright because it didn't matter what had caused them to be here. They were together and safe and that was what mattered
**"Is this yours?"**
The two nodded apprehensively. Unsure what the tall man before them had in store.
**"You want to see it do something special?"** He asked a smile upon his face.
As their eyes widened in anticipation he held the ball flat in his palm. Looking around many were sleeping or taking care of their own. With a little focus the red ball lifted up from his hand where it spun like a planet spinning around a sun. Their eyes became even wider at the site. Letting it "float" for a few more seconds the ball fell back to his hand. Smiling he held it out to the boy. Cautiously the boy took it unsure if it would take off again. Turning quickly they were off running and squealing about what they had just seen. Watching the ecstatic boy hold the ball high as he moved between the families he knew the small thing he did here wasn't the wrong thing to do.
Looking around to see if he had had an audience he didn't see any. He didn't care if her did. It was for children like them he had sought out the Rebellion. Children like those two that were running off deserved a galaxy that was rid of the Empire. Smiling and feeling better he turned about and made his way back to the room. Maybe he shouldn't have done what he did for the kids but the look in their eyes told him that it was worth it.
Having not been gone long he appeared to have made it back to the room before the others. Walking back to the refresher he removed his shirt and looked in the mirror. Nodding to himself he reached for the shaving cream that had been provided. It was time to cast off the old. A new beginning was about to start.

<strong>To a new day.</strong>
Naryen blinks back to awareness with a mental curse and a confused look at finding herself in a chair. ***I was standing just a second ago… must have fainted. Perfect.*** The sarcasm rings as safe and filled with genuine amusement, all new and welcome reactions.
There seems to be some side chatter but Naryen does hear the apology from Runn. She tries to rally a protest but only manages a weak smile and an acknowledging nod. It's then she realizes someone is holding her, probably to keep her from falling over again. Naryen is surprised, then, to find her own hand, returning a squeeze to Elaras shoulder as she leans in the other womans direction. She finds a part of herself relieved to be held by kin and abandoning a sense of her as an adversary. ***We are all young in so many ways. Me most of all.***
At mention of what sounds like real quarters, weary bones call out in joy and Naryen feels a little dizzy. When Runn mentions a debrief tomorrow, however, some part of her begins to protest but is quickly subdued by committee. ***No, rest now. Pushing so much is what comprised your awareness before. These people, your people, and yourself deserve better!***
"Sir yes Sir!" Now *that* got her attention. She looks up at his face and see something she doesn't quite recall seeing there before. "This way sir." Joy.
Elara helps her stagger to her feet and Naryen. With a nod of thanks to the other woman she walks with Tomas out the door with a feeling of rejuvenation and hope. ***He's renewed, here.*** Naryen feels further gratitude at that recalling how broken he seemed after Kashyyk.
The sights and sounds of the hallway, as she stepped through the door with her old friend, and the rest of that part of the station greet her and the feeling of hope that infects her core. She mutters to herself, though it's shared with Tomas **"Tomorrow is, indeed, a new day."**
So many questions swirled in the background of her mind but they knew their place this time. Naryen, again, focused on her surroundings, as Tomas led her by her arm to a private room. She found comfort at his touch, which prompted other things, but that too kept its place. Children playing, people talking, and even the occasional wisp of a celebration, most of it with the same familiarity. **"Though Varbrindal dies, the Varbrindi live."** she whispered as her hand squeezed thanks to his arm.
After what was a lengthy walk, that felt like not nearly enough time to still absorb the sense of life around her, Tomas brings her to a private single room with no barracks that she could recall passing and away from most of the other masses. She stands there for a moment then, releasing his arm, steps away from Tomas into the new space.
A refresher, terminal and a small table are on one side of the room. As she turns back to Tomas, his face and the presence of a bed register together and create something entirely inappropriate in her mind. Naryen immediately realizes this thought is strewn plainly across her face and she casts her eyes down in embarrassment.
Tomas sees his cue and salutes but Naryen notes the pause before it. ***Blast!*** "Sleep well sir." and he turns back down the hall, not waiting for her to compose herself to reply. Naryen looks up and opens her mouth to reply but finds she has nothing to say. With sagging shoulders and a neck to match she keys the door closed and turns back into the empty room.
Her eyes drift back to the terminal and she silences her trained response of a daily report, ***Not an officer, not here.*** ans is halfway to the refresher with clothes half off before she stops, standing there with a smile, as she remembers what she was thinking before waking up in that chair. With a sigh she climbs, naked, into the refresher, and unfortunately alone. Sleep is welcome and sound and for the first time in years, free of nightmares.

As Dexter walks around the station he is amazed as to how much activity is going on. The place was more like a busy space port rather then a shadow port. Captain Runn had a nice size military governorship on his hands. This many people had to put a strain on any resources the good Captain would be able to get ahold of. It was quite a feat to keep this port running smoothly. *"I don't envy the our host at all. He has pulled off something amazing here but keeping it all hidden from the Empire cannot be easy."* Dexter thinks to himself.
He continues his walk around the station taking in everything he can. Children sleeping, Parents making sure they are safe, guarding them has his parents had him. Workers and Techs repairing systems, guards patrolling keeping everything secure. He found himself getting swept up in what was going on. He wanted to help, what he was seeing was making him realize that he had been wasting his life chase adventure and credits. This was something worth his skills and talents. He just hoped his friends felt the same as him. Yes he would help the these people if the Captain would ask him to. He felt sleep tug at his mind and body, he needed to get back to the quarters and get what little he was going to get before the dreams came back. He turns and heads back toward the room.

Dexter walks the corridors of the station for a while. Few others are awake at this time of night, a few patrols of guards the odd officer on the night shift and a parent chasing after a stray child. Finding himself back at the hanger bay to which your group landed. The bay is empty except for your ship a droid and a maintenance worker.
The human is under the ship while the R5 droid passes the man tools. The man stops when he sees you. "Hey there, I don't suppose you know much on installing hyper drive engines? Or bypassing surge relays?"
-----------------------------------
Tar`ja makes her way to the outer edge of the station. The outter corridor circles the station, large windows give a view of the gaseous clouds outside. a few others stand or sit watching the clouds. Music blasts out of a cantina to your left. People inside dance drink and play games of chance.
The a blinking sign names the cantina the Targe Set View. This area of the ship seems to hold a few local business as well making this station less a military base and more a community. Closed shops line one side of the corridor while the other side is dominated by the large view port windows.
-------------------------------------
Sammy passes Kasga a few tools. "You don`t need specs, much of its lay out is similar to a head hunter." Sammy continues his adjustments. "Want to run through a pre-flight check for me while I monitor the ships output and power flow?"
------------------------------------
Chase takes a short walk then back at the barracks begins a ritual of cleanse. Shaving and cleaning up use to be a daily routine while Chase was a student of the force. Thinking of the children puts a smile on Chases face, they are so happy despite what they must have gone through at so young an age.
By morning your group minus Deidra meets up again in the barracks. Breakfast is delivered to you room a variety of fruit and drinks. Your group spends another day in the barracks and around the station. A class 2 hyper drive is installed on the ship and Kasga is allowed the first test flight on the latest X-wing to be constructed on station.
-----------------------------------
Naryen is awakened early in the morning Tomas escorts you to a command terminal. You spend the better part of the day answering questions about imperial strengths weakness, positions, bases, moral, personalities you name it these rebels spare not detail no matter how small.
Exhausted Tomas seems to be taking you the long way to your quarters. Opening a door Tomas reveals a small barracks where the rest of your group sit eating supper together.

Tar'ja had spent the majority of the night..or was it all of the night? wandering the halls, standing and staring at the gas planets, listening to the music in the cantina with a drink or two that went mostly untouched. Sleep wasn't being kind, her mind didn't want it anyway, not until she knew that her sister in arms was alright and still living.
Towards morning, though she had begun to think the night was forever lasting, she made her way back to the room they had been given in time to catch up with the others. She was exhausted, sleep didn't find her though she had dozed for minutes at a time when her body simply shut down before jolting awake again. Her surroundings were foreign and untrustworthy, a place she didn't feel she could let her guard down enough to even believe in sleep...not yet.
Around the table in the barracks with the food, the twi'lek was having trouble, she looked awful, looked tired, and was nibbling at the food before her. She was quiet, her thoughts in her mind and turned to where the other female may have been, if she was alive or safe; had she eaten? did they feed her? why hadn't they returned her to them yet?

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2010-08-22 14:16:26)

Dexter finds himself in the hanger where they had landed. The ship that they arrived in was still there. The memory of how they got it still fresh in his mind. He was glad he was off that dust ball and in a better place he hoped. He wondered how the kind woman and the children where doing, if they where safe and happy. He would make a point to check in on them if fate allowed.
He is dragged out of his thoughts by a voice of a maintenance tech, there was also a R5 with him. *"Hey there, I don't suppose you know much on installing hyper drive engines? Or bypassing surge relays?"* The Tech said. Dexter head snaps around in surprise. "Ah ya I may be able to help you out. I got the back up H-drive installed earlier. Shouldn't be to hard." Dexter starts to move toward the ship removing his cloak and rolling up his sleeves. "Name is Dexter by the way." Smiling at the tech and offering his hand. "Shall we get started?" Dexter pulls out his tool pouch and follows the tech.
After Dexter and the Tech finished on the ship, he could feel sleep pulling at his body and mind. Grabbing his gear and putting away his tools. "I am going to go clean up and rest. If you need anything else give me a call." Dexter smiles at the fact that he had just the first honest work he had done in awhile. He heads back to the room and cleans up. By the time he had gotten the smell of coolant and grease out of his fur breakfast had arrived. *"Oh well I guess I can sleep later."* He thinks to himself. He sets and enjoys the company of his friends. He talks of the work he had done on the ship and the Tech he had worked with. As they talked about what they had seen around the station the door slides open relieving some one that he thought they would see for awhile. Deidra was standing there. The room goes silent. All Dexter can do is smile.
((OCC: Mechanics +15. Will help the tech with whatever work there is to be done.))

After having cleaned up Chase found his bunk again. The smiles and screeching of the children were still with him as he fell back asleep. This night he didn't even bother with meditation as sleep found him easily. His dreams were active. From lessons with Master Garet and the kiss shared with Tar'ja in the Jawa encampment on Tatooine. To the twin brother and sister he had just met on the station. Finally of Deidra who he saw doing well. He felt that soon she would be joining them. His sleep was restful and it left him feeling good in the morning when he awoke.
With breakfast delivered the group was together again minus Deidra still. Looking at Tar'ja, Chase could see the night hadn't been good to her. Though he tried not to pry the feelings she was projecting about their missing friend were quite strong. **"She's alright Tar'ja. It's hard to explain but she felt better to me in the Force."**
The rest of the day was spent mainly hanging around the barracks and walking around. He was getting antsy. Despite what he had told Tar'ja earlier he was getting more worried for Deidra as time went on. He still believed she was alright but why hadn't she been allowed to rejoin them?
Returning to the barracks for dinner was more of the same. Them without Deidra. He dropped the fork he was using on to his plate. He had had enough even though only half the food was eaten. Hearing a noise at the door he looked up. He figured it was another visit to see how they were doing. Looking to see who it was he saw a human who was bigger then he was. As he opened up the door and stepped aside Deidra came into view.
**"Deidra!"** He said out loud as he stood up from the table as he quickly made his way over to the door ushering her into the barracks. **"What have they been doing to you?"**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-08-24 12:02:08)

Tar'ja glanced blearily to the Human at her side, he kept reassuring her but she just couldn't bring herself to believe it...if it were true..she would have been returned to them or at least they would have had some word that she was alright. Nothing...no word, no sign, nothing.
The day was a daze to her, she had laid down after breakfast in some vain attempt to find sleep, but couldn't only doze an hour before she awake again feeling as though no sleep had come to her again.
Dinner came but she didn't eat much, her appetite was gone, glancing to her side she found she wasn't the only one, and she didn't need to be a Jedi to tell that he was antsy all day. Pushing her plate away she had intended to lay her head down, another attempt to find some form of sleep, lekku twitching lethargically when "Deidra!" Her head snapped up, looking to Chase then to the door, low and behold...there she was. Standing quickly the twi'lek followed after the Jedi "What have they been doing to you?"
To hell with questions, she glared at the large human, posture turning defensive as she reached for her friend. It was out of character of her, but of late she had been trying to learn more, and some part of her was sure that this was showing as she searched the woman for injury's; hands and arms were turned over, face was looked over and down the neck, her eyes were looked at for signs of trauma. She couldn't see anything, and she looked healthy! relief washed over her as she simply hugged the woman tightly.
Emotions were new still, she didn't know what to say, or how hugs were really supposed to go. She held her tight though and glared at the human, lack of sleep and over worry had her mind in the position of shoot first, ask later if he moved.

Kasga has had little sleep since he arrived on the station. After the tense interview with Captian Runn, Kasga spent most of the rest of the intervening hours hiding from his brother's legacy and his responsibilities to the Rebellion.
Working with Sammy on the X-wing, he settled his mind into a whirlwind of power relays and hull sealant. The test flight was amazing. The new ship is as fluid as a Headhunter, but packed a bit more punch and acceleration. It still needed some tweaking in the proton torpedos arming mechanisms and the engine power relay normalized. The engines tend to not fire precisely at the same time. During the test flight, Kasga had to work to keep the ship from spiraling.
Kasga's detachment is brought to a screaming halt when Deirdra arrives at breakfast. Kasga leans back away from his food, crossing his arms. Chase asks the question on everybody's mind. Kasga waits unhappily for the answer.

<strong>To a new day.</strong>
In a strange way this was an easy day. Just like school but with easier tests. That whole part that weighed the lives of countless billions on the accuracy of her memory and insights and suggestions didn't stand aside or heckle form the sidelines. It helped. Another first for Naryen as the demons stepped up and lent a hand. And what a hand! Twice she asked for someone to debate with as she formulated one analysis after another. She exhausted them both as she completed those tasks and moved on to new challenges.
She was so engaged she didn't realize she had stopped being able to type, she was dictating separate documents while she typed anyway. After a dozen hours she was actually surprised when they shut off the terminals and moved to help her get up. Her look of confusion left her face when the assistants looked at her hands and she followed their gaze. They were curled and shaking. She hadn't noticed. Her laughter echoed through the room. **"Ah, of course. Another day over."** She, indeed, needed some help to rise from her chair.
Tomas walked with her, silent and strong but with a gaze that missed nothing, as she moved with a slow yet exhausted grace through the station. They were taking a different route but she didn't notice. She was busy absorbing the life of her people around her, smiling, truly happy, with only the occasional tear falling down her cheek.
When they got to the door it was only then that she realized it was not the door she used last night. Her light scowl scrubbed from her features by a knowing smile. ***Of course.*** She stepped to the door, then paused. She looked to Tomas and spoke with a warm smile and in a tone rich with feeling. With the gratitude of someone who saved her people, who stayed true so she could find her way. She threw in an unmistakable expression of *if times were different…* **"Thank you."** She turned without waiting for his response and stepped through the door. Weary bones didn't betray her as she stepped into the room.
She was greeted with a calming purple vision that deepened her smile. A question from Chase was easily answered. **"A resistance stronghold charged with keeping safe thousands of refugees. They have been doing everything one would expect with someone they saw as part of why there are refugees in the first place."** She smiled and shrugged, looking to the ground but by that time Tar'ja was next to her, looking her over. **"If they were Imperials I'd already be dead."** She looked up into the Twi'leks searching eyes, the unspoken question rang deafening into the room. **"I'm well."** She hugged her friend back, resting her head on her tall friends chest, with a welcome sigh and smile. **"In fact I'm more alive now than I think I've ever been."** The color on her face backed this up clearly.
Then a pair of snarling Ranchor cubs went barreling down the hall bellowing into the room as they went.
At least thats the sound effect generated by Naryens suddenly twisted gut matched by the comical flinch twisting her face to match. **"And, apparently, ravenously hungry."** With a giggle she pulled a little from Tar'ja so she can look in her eyes, again, through her hands remained, and even squeezed her friends hips playfully. **"Eat with me?"** With a brief pause lingering in her gaze, she then looked around the room to each of the others there. **"We all need to catch-up, I think."**

Tar'ja had no words, how could she speak? her friend was back..and safe at that..and the giant wasn't moving so he was not a threat...at the moment at least. "If they were Imperials I'd already be dead." that was true she supposed, and she was grateful for that much. Still she didn't let go, some part of her likely hoping to hold onto the odd feelings and work through their meanings. "I'm well." she said "In fact I'm more alive now than I think I've ever been." what did that mean?
"And, apparently, ravenously hungry." she laughed lightly with her, pulling away as she did, chuckling again at the squeeze to her hips and the question "as though I'd let you out of my sight now?" she scoffs, lekku twitching "they'd have to put me in a brig to prevent you leaving us again. She looked meaningfully up to the behemoth of a human, yes this human female was not about to leave their group again.
Arm wrapped around her side the Twi'lek leads Deidra to the table with the others, moving her untouched food to her instead and stands, rather and sits, to ensure that no one would be taking her. Likely from the behavior she would be protective for some time now. "Are you sure you are well?" she asks softly, glancing over to the other human male "is he holding you prisoner?"

Chase smiled as he watched her reaction at seeing them all again. He answer to his question made good sense. A former Imperial here on this station could have dire consequences for all that were aboard. He shifted his focus and his smile continued. Her presence in the Force was strong and bright. Even more so than before they arrived at the station. Clearly something had happened here to bring her around. No longer did he feel the doubts that surrounded her. It was as if their friend was taken away, patched up and returned better than before.
Tar'ja took the roll as protector. He watched her size up the large officer that had arrived with her. He could tell that there was a sense of inner peace about the man but not much else and he didn't feel like prying any further. He followed The two women back to the table.
**"She's been worried about you Deidra. We all have. I tried to reassure them that I could sense that you were alright but very, very stressed."** He smiled. **"Seeing is believing though and I'm glad you're all right."** He paused for a second. **"Does this mean that they trust you now? That they know who you are and what really happened back on Varlbrindal?"**
Tar'ja had assumed the role of protector. It was clear in her posture. She was in no way going to let her out of her sight. At the Twi'leks question as to who her escort was he looked at the man and waited for his friends answer. He had no doubt that like everything else on this station there was surely something more than what it appeared to be.

<strong>To a new day with good friends and a meal. Wahoo!</strong>
((OOC - Seems to be a bit of a time issue, again. With her exhaustive work being debriefed it seems that Naryen must have been working through the night. As long as she gets to sleep in the next few hours her training should allow her to function well.))
Naryen took Tar'jas posturing as the expression of kin it was intended to convey and felt privileged to have earned that place with the twi'lek that spoke the word "family" with such weight. She couldn't help but feel honored, and bolstered, by the sentiment. Her face beamed from the company she now found herself in and realizing now that a feeling of worry had been patiently waiting to be acknowledged. She looked them all over again, this time a little more intently. ***They all seem well. Good.***
She let Tar'ja vent a little in Tomas' direction. Though not quite deserved by the burly ex Imperial she wouldn't deny her friend the chance to express herself. Far from it! This included being guided to the table where food was offered. Naryen smiled again, and nodded, to Kasga as she sat down to the offered plate. A piece of fruit, of some kind, and some dried protein rations rounded out with some starchy veggie and grain-paste confection. The fruit was pierced by teeth and vigor in short order. Naryen closed her eyes and left the juices run, though her mouth did miss some. The slight bitter and deeply sweet spectrum did much to liven her senses that had become quite dull from the over-night effort.
Naryen swallowed the now pulverized fruit portion as she looked to the vision of purple beauty, with the concerned eyes, and answered the question posed. **"I've been more a prisoner of my own mind and the deception of the Empire than a prisoner of these people. They were just being cautious, and rightly so, though I did give them a primer on debriefing future ex Imperials and potential infiltrators based on my experiences with them."** She couldn't help but smile at some of the choice words she used to make sure a good actor wouldn't get past them in the future. ***"…future ex Imperials…" …*** She focused back on the woman, standing guard over her, and shifted a little in the couch-seat wrapped around the table. Keeping her eyes there, but making them a little pleading, she patted the seat next to her as she reached for and stuffed the end of a protein stick in her mouth. ***Please sit with me?*** *chew*.
Chases question cause Naryen pause. She cleared her throat as she began to answer. **"They trust me more but with these people there's no such thing as complete trust. The Empire took that from them and it's an unfortunate necessity for the fight. You never know who to…"** She paused, again, and looked down at the food. **"…trust…"** She put down the knife with the confection on the end and wiped the corners of her mouth. She was clearly rallying for something. She straightened her posture and looked around the room and considered the bounty she had read and the reaction by the Gran when he realized who she was. ***It's served it's purpose but perhaps my name can serve another.***
She smiled again. **"My name is not Deidra Foy. I took that to protect myself and others."** She glanced at Tar'ja, to share a knowing look, recalling the children at Dossanas farm. **"I am Naryen Fae of Varbrindal and former Marine Lieutenant and Tactical Liason to the SD Adjudicator. The Empire has accused me of masterminding the death of billions of my own people."** She nearly laughed out-loud. **"Forget that there's no way I could have issued the orders for it nor had access to the resources to pull it off, the very idea is insultingly laughable in it's scope and audacity!"** She choked off the laughter further. **"Still. My alias served its purpose and now my true name will serve another."** She smiled and took another bite of food considering the scheming she'd started.
She smiled far deeper as she considered what she just said. ***…former…*** It made her heart sing.
With a mouth stuffed with food she managed to articulate, **"Suh. Wud I missz?"** and looked around the room, again.

"I've been more a prisoner of my own mind and the deception of the Empire than a prisoner of these people. They were just being cautious. and rightly so, though I did give them a primer on debriefing future ex Imperials and potential infiltrators based on my experiences with them."
She was alright...the more times she heard it the more she was beginning to feel better, though the protective air wasn't about to leave her presence. Still..the silent request and scooting over..A faint soft smirk crosses her lips as she slides into the seat beside her friend, glad for her presence.
"They trust me more but with these people there's no such thing and complete trust. The Empire took that from them and it's an unfortunate necessity for the fight. You never know who to...trust..." A frown crosses the Twi'leks features, something in her tone made a chill run over her spine, had they done something to her? had her loyalties changed towards them? Her eyes turn to glare at the behemoth, if he did something he would regret it...
"My name is not Deidra Foy. I took that to protect myself and others." Head snaps back to the woman, wide eyed; she had lied of her name? *the little ones..* The reason in her eyes was enough to still the thoughts of what other lies had been spoken, of if she was even worthy of trust now...if it was to protect them..well...she would have done the same.
"I am Naryen Fae of Varbridal and former Marine Officer and Tactician at large attached to the Adjudicator. The Empire has accused me of masterminding the death of billions of my own people. Forget that there's no way I could have issued the orders for it nor had access to the resources to pull it off, the very idea is insultingly laughable in it's scope and audacity! Still. My alias served its purpose and now my true name will serve another."
She smirks faintly again, so she was wanted as well now...fitting it seemed, sisters in arms, sisters to a new family, and now...sisters in wanted prices. She chuckles softly, her trust was not misplaced, this one would be well. "Suh. Wud I missz?" "Us?" she asks, wrapping an arm around her friends waist "where is it they have you sleeping? you must have slept yes? but you were not returned to the barracks we were given."

<strong>To a new day with good friends and a meal. Wahoo!</strong>
She smiled as she finished a protein stick, that was saltier than she'd have liked, but she relished the experiencing of it and the arm that squeezed around her. **"Yes I have missed you."** Just as it was clear, by her projection, that the answer was directed at the group but there was clear emphasis towards Tar'ja in particular.
Naryen leaned her head, finding a purple arm and shoulder to lay on, and sighed with the satisfaction of a hastily enjoyed meal and a friend to relax with. And did just that returning a light squeeze, gain. **"No, I haven't slept, though they tried to stop me more than once. I pushed the debrief far further than I think they had expected. Many hours."** She glanced at, and considered, the food both still on the table and eaten. ***Breakfast* "It seems I kept them up overnight."** She chuckled a little.
She scowled a little and sat up and away from the woman next to her so she could look back at her features. Naryen scanned for, and found, subtle signs of strain and fatigue, likely because she was so very close to Tar'ja. **"Have you slept?"** An idea formed in he mind and it played across her features, then changed to something else as she considered, again, the food. This time with a scowl, full of playfulness, but colored with genuine concern. **"Or eaten?"** She raised on eyebrow slightly with an accompanying nearly-not-there smirk.
With a light rub across the other woman's belly Naryen raised the other eyebrow to match but she was already pretty clear of the answer anyway given the anxiety that seemed to motivate her friends actions. She looked around the room, though adding a little more pressure and movement to the hand on the belly, **"What of the rest of you hmm?"** A little admonition for those that may not have looked after themselves just because she had a complete collapse of self-identity. Such a petty thing.

Tar'ja frowned and colored pink to her cheeks at the mention of sleep..and food. She glances away to clear her throat, so it was showing badly? or did she simply know what to look for? Best change the subject... "you should sleep." she mumbles softly to her friend, "We have some dinner from last night still in the barracks waiting for you..I don't imagine it to have lasted but..I suppose the thought of it is there?"
Yes, good change in subject, she'll never know! hm..extra voice...or was that hers...this must be lack of sleep talking..interesting..
Glancing down curiously to the hand to her stomach she had to wonder at the gesture, was she attempting to feel if there was food within? surely a hand could not tell something like that! unless it had it was a jedi hand...heh...jedi...
The Twi'leks mind and body were relaxing, adrenaline that had been keeping her going was wearing off now that De...Naryen...had been returned to them, her mind was moving over into that form of needing sleep and talking to itself. or herself...something...what was she talking to herself about? What was that hand doing...

Kasga looks around warily as the subject of trust comes up again. He heaves a sigh as his old responsibilities descend. Deirdra's....Naryen's true story comes out. She's right about trust. Given his own history and knowledge about the Tantooine Rebellion cell.
**"Well, I confirmed my brother was here and working for these guys. We reported some of what happened on Tantooine. On the plus side, they have this new amazing starfighter. It's a far cry from the Z-95s I've been using. It's a bit more independent."**
His face turns more serious and his brows furrow as he speaks tightly, **"I could use some help with correcting the power conduits on our ship. "**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2010-08-26 15:37:47)

As Deidra. *"No Naryen."*  Thinks to himself. Explains what had happen to her. The Empire had made out to be something that she wasn't. Which was something not new to him considering what he did, but it was not something he had done to anyone himself. It was still a lot to take in all at one time and he would have to maul it all over in his mind before he knew how he would feel about it. He knew that if she was working on the Empires side she would have betrayed them by now and they had gone through all of that on Tatoonie, so he trusted her. Besides Captain Runn didn't seem the type to just let a security risk run around the station either. *"Yes this will take sometime to process."* Dex had to feel sorry for the escort that had brought Naryen to there room. Tar'ja had taken a general dislike to him and if he stepped out of line she would snap his head off at the neck with her bare hands. He had seen that look before on her and it was not a pleasant experience. He was glad she was on his side for the most part.
Kasga talks about this new fighter he had been helping out with, and the fact they where having some trouble with the power conduits. "I could give you a hand Kasga." Dex say interested in checking out the fighter. "Well, the ship has a hyper drive now. We found this nice Cantaina here on the station. Made some new friends." Dex smiles. There really hadn't been a lot going on. "Captain Runn has quite a place set up here. I look forward to helping him out." Dex continues smiling. "Glad to have you back Naryen." "So anyone else doing anything interesting?"

Dexter nodes to Kasga. "That big of a job huh? This ship must be something then." Dex smiles. He kind of like working on things. He was thinking that maybe he needed to look into it a little more. Besides a tech was would always be needed.
He finishes off his cup of caf and picks up a piece of fruit. "So Chase you find anything interesting on the station? I wondered for awhile but I may have missed something along the way." Dex didn't want to make it seem like he was interrogating his friends. It was just in his nature to understand where he was and what was going on around him. *"Information is power after all"* He thinks to himself.

Sitting at the table Chase watched the others around him interact. It was almost as if nothing had happened and things were the same as before. The interaction, and mannerisms were a bit different, felt different too. Well to him anyway. While the Force was a fantastic ability it sometimes provided him with insights others might not pickup.
Things had changed. They have all seemed to have come to some sort of an conclusion about this place and with each other.
He looked as Nayren and Tar'ja. How two women so different could become close friends seemed incredulous. Clearly Tar'ja wasn't going to let her out of her sight again. He could sense her fighting to understand emotions that were creeping forward again, emotions that were concerning Nayren.
Nayren seemed rejuvenated. Her ordeal with the Rebels and Captain Runn have seemed to lift her out of the down ward spiral she was on ever since the bounty hunter attack in the cantina. Perhaps finally admitting her real name had had some effect in that regards.
Kasga looked like he had accepted that his brother was here and a member of the Rebellion. His own words confirming that fact. Out of all of them, even Nayren, he was the one who distrusted others the most. Chase knew that it wasn't easy for the Duros to trust others. The fact that he trusted them spoke volumes.
Finally his gaze fell to Dexter. The Bothan who seemed to have an ability to miss the obvious but at the same time come out better for it.
They were all together again. Now maybe they could get to doing something. He wanted to talk with Captain Runn. He had many questions for the man. Many concerning the Force and how he perceived it. He wasn;t Master Garet but Chase was sure that he could learn much from the man.
He was brought out of his thoughts by Dexter. "So Chase you find anything interesting on the station? I wondered for awhile but I may have missed something along the way."
He shook his head as a hand came up to rub his freshly clean shaven face. The smoothness felt good reminding him of his training with Garet. **"No not really. I spent a good deal of time wandering last night when you all had left the barracks here. I walked among the refugees for a time. While I sensed a good deal of despair there was also an overwhelming sense of pride, determination and courage among the people."** A smile danced across his face as he recalled the twins. **"If you happen to come across two children, twins. Who think their ball has some sort of magic within it that caused it to spin and move in circles through the air. They are telling the truth."**
He looked at them all as his smile was slowly fading from his face. **"I know we all have our different reasons for seeking out the Rebellion. We don't have to look any farther, we're here. The question now is, what do we do?"**

<strong>To a new day with good friends and a meal. Wahoo!</strong>
"I could use some help with correcting the power conduits on our ship."
Naryen had turned to look down at her hand on Tar'jas belly. There was an idle bit of wonder over the desire for her hand to be soapy and the cloth to not be in the way. It was just as that registered that what Kasga had said started to itch. Then it started to burn. Then it flashed bright. The banter of the others, seeming to not pick up on Kasgas cue, were mentally filed and set for future reference.
The relaxation pulled from centerpiece in her mind with a moaning protest as an entire chorus crescendoed into it's place. There was a light ripple in her features and her posture, not readable from even a short distance but was quite evident to the other woman in such close proximity. Hand shivered for an instant, breath abruptly changed pace and disposition, and hands started to drift around with more show than intent.
As everything moved with a singular focus Naryen changed mental gears and was able to regulate her breathing as her eyes came up to meet Tar'jas. Their intensity was in sharp contrast to her voice and all other outward features but their fierce focus was easily conveyed as blue eyes met, as Tar'ja turned back to her.
**"That's a pain!"** Her tone is all playful bother but the eyes, the cold and focused eyes piercing out from her face and driving into Tar'jas awareness. **"Looks like they're an ongoing problem and I'd really like to get some sleep."** With a pout and downward cast eyes she leaned forward to Tar'ja, outwardly a slouch of annoyance, though the alert purple woman was be able to easily feel the change in Naryens muscles, so close to her own, as they tensed and prepped. Everything about the former Imperial spoke to a spring being coiled and set.
**"Can it wait?"** This came out with a layered intensity she didn't intend. ***Blast, that was sloppy! Still can be taken other ways but still… Breath.*** and she did.
(((OOC - I'll spell it out in the OOC thread if need be, but since no-one else picked up on it (Especially Dexter so it seems.), so far, I think it fitting that Naryen did, given the circumstances. I hope I got it Galandb. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> )))

A change in breath and muscle reaction had the twi'lek looking down faintly to the other woman, her posture turning to a more alert state as her body switched to a prepared fight or flight situation. Her tone and those eyes...they were geared to what Kasga had been talking about, making a frown cross her features.
Perhaps she shouldn't have written off his want to play with the ship as something of him just wanting to get something else done to it, perhaps there was more reason..but what? Well...if he had information to speak of that would be the best place to speak..not to mention their weapons were all there.
Though if that were the case..why would De..**Naryen** not wish to go straight away? The frown deepens as she rests her arm around her friend "if you are tired then we should retire for a while...I suppose it wouldn't hurt to get some too." she said begrudgingly, she was doing her best to not let sleep affect her, but it was catching up.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-08-28 23:53:13)

Something was bothering Chase but it didn't register right away. Kasga had mentioned they all go to the ship to work on some power conduits that were giving him some trouble. Knowing that the Duros was a good technician in his own right should have said something to him. It may have been the fact that he wasn't a mechanic that he didn't pick up on it or it was the subtle feelings he was picking up on that seemed...odd for the former Imperial.
It wasn't till Nayren asked if it could wait that it seemed that he had been hit in the head with Kasga's earlier question as he answered Nayren. "It can wait, but I'd rather it not wait very long."
Ever cautious Kasga was. Now that they were all together the best place to talk might just be their ship. Stepping around Tar'ja's confirmation of also being tired he came closer to the table.
**"Kasga may have a point. If we cant figure out what is wrong with the ship it wont be much good to us. It shouldn't take long with all of us looking into it."** He nodded looking at the two women hoping that they may understand the need to do this now and not later. He was hoping that Tar'ja did at least. Nayren seemed a bit off and not like herself.

Tomas takes notice of the slightly hostile attitude on his entrance. At the notion of holding one prisoner Tomas merly smiles then nods to Nayren "Sir I will be just outside for a moment if you need anything." With a salute he turns heading for the door pausing only to meet Chases gaze.
As the door opens you can see Captain Runn outside waiting for Lt Tomas Lars. "Sir!?" Tomas bursts out as he stands to attention saluting his superior.
"We have an issue we have lost con ...." The door closes behind Tomas closing your group off to the rest of their conversation while you continue your own.
------------------------------------
While you group continues to eat and talk the door opens again. Tomas enters first followed by Captain Runn. The door closes leaving two guards outside.
Looking at Nayren Tomas starts "Sorry sir, we have an issue we would like to discuss." The man stands at attention flanking the Captain.
Captain Runn stops beside Tomas for a moment then continues inside the barracks. Giving your group a slight bow the Captain begins "I realize we have only recently meet and what I am about to say is asking a lot of you, especially with what your group has recently been through." The Captain smiles looking at each of you in turn gathering your reactions. "Recently we have lost contact with an agent of ours. With our current mission of relocating the refugees to a safe planet most of our ships are unavailable."
Tomas moves to stand next to his Captain as Captain Runn continues. "We are currently at war with the Empire which spreads our resources even thinner. I would request your aid in this matter."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-08-31 13:07:49)

With them all pretty mush ignoring the man that brought Nayren to then he decided to leave. Chase couldn't blame him much. He was one of the people that were keeping their friend from them. "Sir I will be just outside for a moment if you need anything." Saluting Nayren he made a crisp turn. With only a slight pause the officer looked at Met his gaze ever so briefly. He gave the man a slight nod as he began walking to the door.
Watching the man leave Chase spots Captain Runn outside. As the door was closing Chase picked up part of what Runn had begun to say. "We have an issue we have lost con ...."
Raising an eyebrow he looked back to the others. He wasn't sure if anyone else had caught that brief exchange. He figured that if it was deemed need to know they would find out.
Taking in the group she sat down at the table. Deidra was still slouched against Tar'ja. Something was different about her. Before she had always kept her emotions close, bottled up. Now they seemed to oozing out of her with no abandon. ***Interesting. Before she always seemed uptight barely showing emotion unless the situation was stressful like the ambush in the cantina from the Gran. I wonder what was done to effect this change in her?***
He decided to keep his observation to himself as they figured out if they were going to go to the ship. If only Kasga wanted to go that was fine.
The door slides open again as Thomas enters followed by Runn with Tomas announcing that something has come up. Again the big man was looking at Nayren as he spoke.
Chase listened as Runn explained the problem. They had lost contact with an agent. Chase listened closely as he spoke and watched as Runn looked at each of them when he paused. "We are currently at war with the Empire which spreads our resources even thinner. I would request your aid in this matter."
Chase looked back at the older Force user. **"Captain Runn, I can't speak for everyone but we wouldn't be here if we didn't want to help. Perhaps you could elaborate more as to the specific problem and what you would like us to do?"**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **master_Tru** (2010-08-31 18:22:21)

Captain Runn nods to Chase. "Yes indeed. An agent of ours a mister Jerreb Kov`yan, an associate of yours I do believe Dexter." Jerreb Kov`yan was a fellow student of yours in the academy. She was top of your class and alway three steps ahead of you in most every lesson. You dread to think of what kind of trouble she could be in that she needed help getting out of.
"Jerreb was on an intelligence mission gathering information and possible resources on potential imperial assets. Our agent Jerreb was on a promising lead when we lost contact with her." Captain Runn pauses again looking at each of you in turn.
"The information this agent possesses could help turn the tide of this war. We lost contact with her in the Besboo system on a remote planet called Besbooaan. The mission should be no more then a simple pick up and delivery of our agent. Though this system is controlled by the empire therefore any mission even the easiest could become complicated." The Captain stops having giving your group the short version of the mission. He waits for your groups expressions and replies.

Kasga gets tense when he hears about the lost contact. This cell definitely has problems. Those power couplings are getting more critical by the moment. 
Chase offers the assistance of the group. Kasga is uncertain of the wisdom of this offer and his face shows it. This Rebellion cell is the only link to his brother's disappearance. On the other hand, The way this organization leaks information, he'll be lucky to get out alive.
Mostly he stands there looking stuffed hoping to talk to his friends about his concerns.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Rebaav** (2010-09-02 00:05:29)

<strong>To a new day with good friends and a meal. Wahoo!</strong>
Naryen watches Dexter, and Captain Runn, intently as he draws attention to the relationship between the lost contact and their Bothan agent. ***Looking for a reaction Runn?*** In her mind she laughs at herself. ***Ha! Of course you are, as am I.***
Chase makes his intent clear and speaking the obvious sentiment of the rest them while, as a rather contrary move, separating himself from a position of leadership. She's left shaking her head, in her head of course, wondering at the seemingly passive-aggressive tactic.
Seeing what she needs from Dexter and Runn Naryen turns back to Tar'ja, or rather her hand on her friends shirt. She didn't realize she was gripping it so hard but then does, reluctantly, release it and the moment she so desperately wants to hand onto. She whispers **"Perhaps we can sleep on the way."** and straightens her posture, pulling away but not completely. Something which seems would never happen now. It is then that she turns her attention to Kasga, who was clearly waiting for a reply from the group to his request for a huddle in the only thing close to a secure location they have.
Naryen makes the decision to provide it.
With an agreeing nod to Chase but directing her speech to Captain Runn and the attending Lieutenant Lars, **"I'll help, of course,"** a bit of tone from the debrief enters her voice here, though she chooses not to point out her planet of origin this time. **"I'll need a complete work-up. Last reported interaction & location. Contacts with complete dossiers. Routines, both public and covert. In short, every scrap both verified and not." *Chew on that!*** She then adds **"Though we do have something to attend to which, and please correct me if I'm mistaken Kasga, now requires far more immediate attention, yes?"**

Dexter went wide eyed at who the Rebel agent was. He quickly recovers his composer. "I see the teachers pet got in over her head." Dexter says with a smile that didn't really cover up his concern for his former class mate. He became some what restless at hearing the news. Turning to Captain Runn. "Of course I am willing to help, but this will be far from a simple snatch and grab. If the Empire has her they will be waiting for someone to coming looking for her. I can assume you have a plan for getting us in and out with her alive?" Dexter tried to keep his emotions in check, but it was hard.
Jerreb Kov`yan had always been a pain. She was better then he was. He always tried to catch up to her, but he couldn't. He would do things to make his teacher notice him, but he got the negative out of them. It is not that Dexter wasn't good at what he did, it had taken them awhile to trace it back to him. It was that she was better and Dex had a hard time with that. Now of course he realized that it was not jealousy anymore it was respect. If she was in trouble it was up to him to get her out of it if he could. His training kicks in. He starts running through what he may need and what could go wrong with a mission like this. He excuses himself from the table and stands turning his back toward the captain a his friends moving closer to the opposite wall collecting his thoughts. He pulls out his data pad and starts checking his list of contacts and figuring out who may have information that might help. "Captain. Did Jerreb have any contacts on the ground? Safehouses? What was her cover? This is info we will need to do this." He figures out how long it would take to get the ship repaired and ready to go. "If you will all excuse me I need to check a few things. Captain if could get that info for me." Dexter heads for the door and to the nearest terminal he had to contact a few friends and check on somethings.

Chase Began watching Dexter as Runn mentioned that the agent was an associate of Dexter's. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Nayren doing the same. ***Trying to gain a glimpse too I see.*** The initial surprise on the Bothan's face was covered up quickly with a quaint remark. One that wasn't overtly friendly that maybe spoke of some hidden jealously. As he went on and asked a few questions it was his initial remark that surprised him. He always figured the Bothan's were a bit closer than that. Then again all he really knew about Bothan's was what he had observed from Dex. Dex excused himself from the table and walked away from the group. He shifted his gaze to the others at the table.
Watching Nayren straighten up though not fully as she is still leaning into Tar'ja. It reminded him of some of the crew on the *Bloodhawk* when they would put into port and go seeking companionship. ***She can handle it. She may not understand the emotions behind it but she can handle it.*** He thought to himself.
Quickly Nayren began asking questions as to what they would need for info in order to effect some sort of operation if the decided to take it. He was happy to see that while her emotions were all off the chart at least her tactical and cunning side were still in working order.
Being to the point she finished quickly. At her mention of Kasga he looked to their pilot. He was standing there rather stiff as if he was surprised that they were even considering this operation. Chase knew that Ever since Kurn had died Kasga was having some serious trust issues with the whole Rebellion idea. It seems that coming here and seeing his brothers room hasn't quelled all those fears yet.
With Dex returning to the group asking questions rapid-fire like. Most of the questions seem to be similar to the ones Nayren had just asked Runn. ***Wasn't he listening. Typical…*** He was thinking but was brought out of his thought as Dex began speaking again. "If you will all excuse me I will be at the ship seeing to the repairs. Captain if could get that info for me." As quick as his words Dex headed for the door and was out of the room.
Chase stood there looking from his friends to Runn and back again. He raised his hand with a finger extended. **"Um…"** But stopped as he looked at the door that their resident spy had just left. **"I can't explain that or why he left so quickly."** Shifting his weight he looked back at Runn. **"I would have thought that he would have waited to see if you already had that info on you before he left."** The disbelief is somewhat hidden on his face but it's readily seen by those that can sense his emotions. This latest run off reminded him when Dex ran out of the cantina when they were still trying to come up with a plan to find a ship to buy. The blasted Bothan ran off then too.
He took a calming breath as he regained his composure and focus. Let Dex run off At least those still here can figure out whats going on.

Dexter realized his behavior was not what his friends had expected of him. It was how he dealt with things in his life. His parents deaths, what happened on Tatoonie. He ran from hardship most of his life. Hell the only reason he was on Tatoonie in the first place was cause he had made the higher ups mad and they banished him there. *"This time will be different. Spynet will just right Jerreb off and send another after awhile. I am going to get her out of there."* He thinks to himself. *"Could have stayed around to get the information I needed, but I have my own contacts. I can check and see if there is any more to this then what the Captain had. I am not going to let people I care about down again if Ii can help it."* He thinks to himself. If he could get a secure channel or a message out to a couple of his contacts he might be able to set up somethings that would make the job easier. He would just have to hope that the good Captain would accuse him from use using the comms here. It was risky but everything they did was that way.
((OCC: Looking for a Comm terminal or Holonet terminal to make contact with the outside. Need to use some contacts for info. If this is ok. I am assumeing that it is.))

Tar'ja was confused by changes in posture to her friend, leaning one minutes not leaning the next but still close to her...was it separation anxiety? She knew about that one, she knew most of those ideas of the mind, sometimes that was the best place to begin to break a person down...hm...maybe that was why she liked that..it reminded her of herself..
Pay Attention.
The captain of the ship entered, Dex was typical, Kasga was...anxious? Naryen, was odd, she wasn't sure how else to place that, but why was she so close? the twi'lek was not blood related, was not a member of a true family...though had she too thoughts of being in this new form of family that was much better then the one they both grew up in..hm.. Chase...ah...Chase...sometimes it was better not to try to explain the bothan, less pain in the head.
Kasga's nervousness..anxiousness? the..jittery thing. was annoying her. It seemed he was unable to wait much longer for this meeting to be over. Turning her cool gaze back to the captain her arm gives her friend a squeeze, glad for her being in close proximity again. "Perhaps we might pick up the pace of this conversation, We need to see to repairs of the ship so that we might take off sooner." She motions to the Captain "if you are able to answer the questions spoken now please do so quickly, otherwise it would be good to have them written later for us to look over on our way."
There, that was...what's the word...diplomatic, ordering a quickness of information for efficiency's sake. Yes. That was diplomatic...wasn't it?

After the Captain asked D...Naryen for help, she quickly accepted and asked for more information. It took him a moment to realize she had addressed him.
**Um…Yeah. If we are planning to deploy using our ship, then those repairs become quite a bit more urgent.**
Dexter seemed a bit spiteful hearing about his classmate. He asked a series of rapid-fire questions, then didn't wait around to hear the answers. All thrust and no vector.
Kasga settled back into parade rest and waited to be dismissed.

Dexter finds the terminal he is looking for. He activates the comm system and tries to find a secure signal to the outside. His figures dance across the keyboard with a practice ease. As he was about to get where he wanted to be the door is slammed in his face. "No network access allowed, your actions have been reported." Comes across the screen. "Damn!" His fists pound down on the console. *"Well I guess they weren't going to just let me raise a beacon to where this place is. Stupid Idiot."* He thinks to himself. He sets and thinks for a moment. "Maybe." he says to himself. "No, there is no point in making the rest of them suffer cause of my actions."
He gets up form the seat and heads for the hanger where there ship is. *"Maybe checking over the ship and my gear may calm my nerves."* He knows returning to the room would get more questions then he was ready to answer and he didn't really feel like talking at the moment anyway.

Captain Runn raises an eyebrow to Kasga, "Chase I am glad you have chosen to help us, I would hope the rest of your group would assist as well." Nodding to Nayren the Captain smiles as she too vows her assistance.
When Tomas hear Dexters initial response about Jerreb Kov`yan the LT looks a little shocked. "Jerreb has done more for this ..." Cut off by a raised had from the Captain, Tomas follows orders and keeps himself in check. Years of military training will do that to an individual.
"Tomas, its ok. Thank you Dexter I am sure your friends will need your special skills on this matter, though I hope they do not. As for an extraction, I am sure you have a pilot." Runn looks at Kasga again. Through most of the Captains words where spoken to Dexters back as he exited the room. The Captain then nods to Tar`ja, with a smile Runn states "Certainly, though I have had repair crews on the ship overnight."
As if on queue Tomas speaks up with a ships status report."With Dexters help the Suro-sub mark 2 hyper drive was installed. After Dexter retired for the evening our crews continued installing a standard shield kit, as well as topside and underside Siener cannons. The ship is ready for flight."
"Your ship has no call sign, that's bad luck to most spacers, and will attract much attention at star ports." You all hear a beep beep beep sound coming from both Runn and Tomas. "It seems your friend Dexter is a little impatient and tried to activate communications. Your group is ready save a pilot." Again the Captain looks to Kasga. "You are so much like your brother yet so different. I realize you only have my word on this but Kirn would have been proud of who you became. If for nothing else your friends here need a good pilot on this mission, will you help?"

Kasga was distracted thinking about what he needed take care of that he actually forgot to accept that actual mission. **"Uh…I'll be happy to help. I wasn't sure you were intending to deploy us as a unit. Those upgrades will definitely help. If things get too messy, that ship will still fly like a brick. I'd rather take a squad of Y-wings. At least they'll turn reasonably. Now if we could add some additional thrusters, I'd be more confident."**
Kasga's analysis of the ship's capabilities came out by rote. In truth, he was still trying to decide to whether to complete his report about the Reaper's mission.
Now is not the time. But I definitely need to decide before we leave.

Captain Runn smiles "Thank you Kasga I am sure your skills as a pilot will more then make up for the lack of thrusters."
Tomas steps forward "Sorry Kasga combat thrusters are in short supply, we have been using what we have in the X-wing program." The large man then steps to the side.
Captain Runn moves to the door "Well then it sounds like your group wants to get started, Tomas will fill you in on Besbooaan`s coordinates." Captain Runn gives your group a bow then leaves.
LT Lars moves to the door as well. "If your group needs a few minutes I will be at the ship waiting with your coordinates. Remember, a ship without a name is bad luck its the spacers code." Tomas steps outside without waiting for a reply the door closes behind him.

<strong>To a new day with yet another life risking cluster such. Wahoo!</strong>
Naryens brow raised, to match her hackles, at Runns comment to Chase. ***"your group"…*** but was quickly cleared from her face by her diplomatic instincts. The irritation subsided shortly after that when she processed that it was not gender oriented like what she had been used to. She returned the nod, in kind, with a smile of appreciation ***Well, that was refreshing.*** Dexter provided a clear distraction then.
She scowled after him as she tried to work out the puzzle that was their Bothan agent. He seemed to retreat into his own mind and then left the room. She thought back to the briefings she was given, while an Imperial Marine Leutenant, that always referred to Rebel Terrorists working in groups. Contrarily, also in ever increasing numbers and effectiveness regardless of supposed successes against them. This all seemed to clash with what she just witnessed until she considered what was said about the missing agent. ***She's alone.***
Realization came at once, washing the scowl from her face, when she considered that the Imperial briefings were, apparently, empty propaganda just as much as anything else that came from them. More and more they seem like the deceitful spirits, which stories tell live in the ice flows of her home-world, that stole away wandering and solitary children. ***Imps! Ha!*** She had an immediate image of Dexter, performing for Varbrindi children, dressed up like one of those creatures of lore. A spiny solitary, and crazed, hunter slinking between the shadows.
A surge of sympathy welled in her, directed at Dexter, as he acted out of fear for what seemed to be his friend, the lost agent, and reacted on instinct that would likely be useful if they were any place other than a rebel stronghold, with predictable results. Tomas' displays of loyalty were notable and the upgrades done to the ship caused Naryens browse to raise. ***Impressive.*** She looked to Kasga to gage his reaction to his ruse having been laid bare and was impressed, again, as he redirected by drawing attention to the ships lack of agility, thusly making the mention of the power systems needing attention seem still quite reasonable.
Runn countered with a mention of his skill, but that didn't quell her concerns. Naryen was about to mention, to Runn, that if their pilot had concerns perhaps there an alternative could be worked out, but he excused himself. Looking to Tomas she finds herself talking to a wall. ***"Dismissed." Indeed.***
She sighs, in frustration and comfort, and relaxes, almost cuddling up to Tar'ja, then says to Kasga **"I'm sure we can address the power systems during our pre-flight,"** A look of intensity with the tiniest of nods to him then it switches to a more genuine scowl of wider eyed interest. **"What is an 'X-wing' and why does, what I'm guessing is a kind of transport like ours, get priority with thrusters?"**
Naryen starts to, absently, twirl a pinch of Tar'jas shirt while she engages Kasga in conversation before they leave.

Chase's eyebrows raised slightly at Runn's mentioning of those gathered being "his group". To be honest with himself it wasn't something he was looking for. He wasn't a natural leader and he knew that. He also knew that he lacked the training to lead people. Yes the Force can and has given him insight but it wasn't the same as the training that say Kasga and Nayren have had.
As Runn quickly and unexpectedly informed them about their ship and the recent upgrades he let out a soft whistle. Either they were real generous with what they had or they were looking for them to take this mission one way or another. Runn seemed to catch Kasga off guard with the additions to the ship. Though when the Duros agreed to the mission Chase gave a nod to the pilot who had shown his skills on their way out of Tatooine.
Before he knew it Runn was at the door and with parting word from both the quickly left. He had other questions for Runn but now figured that it was going to have to wait. With a smirk he looked back to the others. With Dex already gone it left the four of them. Himself and Kasga who were still standing and Nayren and Tar'ja who were sitting. The former was still acting odd. It wasn't just her actions but the small glimpses of emotion he felt coming off the former Imperial. Not to mention the way she was hanging on Tar'ja was not her normal self. At least the normal he had some to know. There was no mistake something had happened to her during the time apart.
At Nayren's question to Kasga he sat at upon the table and placed one foot on the bench as he turned towards them. It was odd that they would outfit them with all the new systems but not thrusters. He added in a question quickly before Kasga could answer. **"Not to mention why did they outfit our ship like they did? It's as if they were they already expecting us to accept the mission? What if we had said no? I'm surprised that neither one of you picked up on that."** He indicated Nayren and Kasga. **"Both of you have been the most paranoid since we have arrived here. Though both of you seem…preoccupied."** He waited for answers to his questions.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-09-07 12:20:08)

Tar'ja listens to the new additions to the ship with a raised brow. Somehow she had thought that if they were going to ever send them on a mission they might outfit them with something newer and more easily capable of movements...She found it strange that not only were they being sent out, they who had just 'joined' with only a day of rest, instead of those groups that might be more experienced in how the Rebellion may deal with extracting their own people.
As the Captain leaves, the twi'lek turns to the others; the twirling of her top by the woman that was cuddling up to her was confusing, she had no real idea how to react that save to just let her. "What should we do then? This entire operation seems...strange."
She nods to Chase to his reaction "It did seem odd, as well..why would they send us? yes I have faith in our skills as we work well together but...why would they not send their own teams?" She frowns "I begin to wonder if this is a mission they expect us to fail, or if there is more than what they say they would not wish to risk their teams for." She shakes her head "He said there lines were thinned due to the war but we have seen teams here...and what *if* we had said no.."
The twi'lek sighs and shifts in her seat to better place the woman more comfortably against her. "Things may be strange here, but we have agreed, it might be est to just simply get this over with..and speak more within the ship." She frowns "I do not like not having my blaster."

At Naryen's question, Kasga smiles. **"It's a new fighter. It handles great. I've run a couple test flights. It still has a few things to work out. If they are going to make more of them, they will need those thrusters. "**
Kasga inclines his head toward Chase, **"I beg your pardon. When I find a place I feel more comfortable, I hope I'll settle down."**
He turns and looks Chase straight on and continues softly, **"Back on the ship might help."**
Moving on to Tar'ja, Kasga sighs, **"That ship is not ours. It was purchased by this house. They can prepare that ship for whatever they need. If we didn't accept, another team would need those mods."**
He smirks over at Chase, **"How's that for paranoid?"**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-09-07 14:48:50)

"How's that for paranoid?" The Duros pilot smirked at him.
Chase smiled back at Kasga. **"That's pretty good. Lets say that If I ever see you not paranoid then I will begin to worry."** He said with a chuckle as shifted his weight as he continued to sit on the table.
He paused for a moment as he looked at the three of them. **"Not to add to your paranoia but who is to say that the ship will be any better to talk in? As you said it is their ship. Their Techs have been working on it since we got here repairing and upgrading. They've had plenty of time to make it so that there would be no place aboard that would be "safe" to talk amongst ourselves. Nayren was fearful of that fact when we first go on the ship."** He looked from Nayren to Kasga. **"Who's to say that has changed?"**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **galenbd** (2010-09-08 10:46:00)

Kasga grimaces at Chase's question. **"I considered that as well. Regardless of the changes made, I feel like we can make it secure at least long enough to have talk a little. At least on the ship, what we have to do won't seem strange. It may take a bit of work, however."**

As Dexter makes his way into his the hanger where the ship that had brought him and his friends was setting. He finds a crate or table and pulls out his tool pouch, data pad, comm link, xtra scrambler, he a ranges them on the flat surface and starts to check over and carefully clean each one. This was a trick that he was taught during training. It helped calm his mind and aloud the training to take over. His mind drifts back to when he was in the academy. To the better times in his life. Jerreb Kov`yan had been a thorn in his side then, but an attractive one. A smile plays across his limps at the thought. Oh sure there had been something between them not long after thier training was finished and they where on mission together, but with the lives they where leading it was going to complicate things. It could also be used against them so they went thier separate ways.
His life had taken a strange twist and turns when he had found himself on Tatoonie. Hocking his skills to the highest bidder. Doing whatever he needed to pay the bills and keep a roof over his head. Until he got caught ripping off a crimelord and he had barely made it out a live that day. *"I wonder how my friend is fairly? He was beat up pretty good and I am no doctor. I will have to check on him sometime."* Dexter thinks to himself while working. He continues his work waiting for his friends to contact him or come to the hanger to leave for the mission.

<strong>To a new day with yet another life risking cluster such. Wahoo!</strong>
Naryens features perk at the mention of a new fighter and her mind races with the possibilities. Limited resources and using her experience with Imperial baseline tactics was enough for her imagination to surge. Her fatigued mental state allowed the crash of ideas to run rampant. A little mental gibe and matching glare at Chase, at the mention of her first reactions in the ship. ***I wasn't afr… ok maybe I was.*** Her mood eased as Chase didn't elaborate on the exchange they had had there.
Returning to the rush, which was liberating at first, she was quickly able to see the cause. ***Wow, I'm tired and distracted…*** Her realization of this caused a trained audit response, starting with her immediate state and then rolling it back in time. She started to flush a little as she realized how her distracted hands could be seen and that Tar'ja had not really been responding to her touch, which was itself a response.
She stopped her hand and turned to given her friend an apologetic look but that's when Tar'ja mentioned her discomfort. A rush of humour, empathy, and a feeling of a connection, over being in a new situation, beamed at the other woman from Naryens senses. That set things better. A nod, as she looked between Kasga and Chase, to show agreement to their assessment.
She stretched, straightening up and away from, and yawned, her slight but well shaped form a crescent feminine features. **"ag sit-rep…Sorry."** She flushed a little as she slipped into fast chatter and relaxed back down to the couch, Tar'ja free of her fiddling digits but still close to her. **"I agree. Add a surveillance sweep to our pre-flight. Then talk."** she felt a little disappointed that they weren't still using the "power systems" code phrase. ***That was fun. We should talk about sticking with that.***
**"I'd like to hear about this fighter but I think I'll need to bunk very soon."** She stared at the empty plate for a moment, a little dazed and light-headed from the effort of stretching. She blinked out of it. **"*Sigh*, If we don't get going soon I'll need to be carried."** She smirked at the imagined look on Tomas' face if Chase walked by with her in his arms.

Naryen scowled a little at Kasgas response as she kicked back her mind fog, for a moment. **"I'm sorry, Tomas said our current task is to conjure a call-sign for our newly equipped ship where he'll wait for us."**  She looks down at the floor as she sways in place for a moment. **"I'm sure it's not the case but I don't recall either of them acknowledging me or Dexters request for dossiers or other information, just 'coordinates'".** scowls further **"Odd. We really need that information and the must have something they can give us besides just 'coordinates'".**
She shrugs as she lays her head down, a little closer to Tar'ja, to keep the room from spinning too much. **"As for the call-sign, I'm bias. I'd want a name from my home that makes enemies blood freeze in it's veins."** A look of feral joy is replaced with disappointment and she closes her eyes as she admits to herself and the group, **"That would compromise us.

Tar'ja had to agree, something simple and unassuming would be the best course of action for the moment, it would serve a greater purpose in the end then one that struck fear. The woman's swaying and tiredness though was concerning her, yes she too was quite tired but she wondered what they had done to her to make her like this...
Nudging the woman gently she makes to stand "I think it's best we move to the ship, the giant will be waiting for us and some of us can get some sleep if need be." She nods to the human woman beside her with a smirk.

It took considerable effort to not fall from her sitting position to laying totally over on the couch-seat, from Tar'jas playful attentions. Naryen smiled at her friend. She had been pushing herself so hard for so long and now felt energized, full of life, but deeply in need of rest. The offer to have someone, someone she was comfortable with, to be with her while she slept. To have some security while she slept, so she could sleep.
She made a point of looking, intently, at Tar'jas smirk and nodded agreement to the offer and in a soft, almost whispered, voice said **"I need good sleep, and company, quite badly. Yes."** The 'Yes' came out almost like a purr. The adrenaline, from being with her friends again and from the exaltation of having provided so much information to the rebel cause, had begun to wear off. Her body was starting to ache and weaken, especially her hands. She started to consciously move her fingers, working through a burning stiffness that shot up her arms. Given what she had done to drive herself to this state, she couldn't help but smile, and welcomed the pain like a new and dear friend.
**"We ek… *cough*"** Her eyes widened in surprise then smiled. She had forgotten how long she had talked! She reached, with shaking hands, for a drink from the table. She found quickly she needed two hands and the citrus flavored liquid was warm but welcome. After she drew some more from the pack she tried again. **"We,"** a nod to Tar'ja **"should go ahead. You two decide on the call-sign, and please nothing to 'spiritual', I think there's been enough of that."** A glare but then a wink to Chase. She hoped he would get that she wasn't pleased at him starting a rumor about a magic man with the refugees. The last thing they needed around here was the additional attention of a Jedi-hunting team.
Naryen slowly stands, shaky but seemingly solid and makes her way to the door with just as much determination and lack of speed. **"I'm sure whatever you decide will be fine and you'll catch up."**

Tar'ja was at her side the moment she stood, she would have liked to have left with the other two, but she understood, and knew herself that if they did not leave soon for a bunk she'd likely fall asleep at the table; something she'd like to avoid. Taking her friends arm she gives support and guidance as they make their way out, turning to cast Chase's smile to him before returning her attention to the human female.

Chase was watching as Nayren took the drink from the table and drank it. It was obvious that she was tired and need time to sleep. "We, should go ahead. You two decide on the call-sign, and please nothing to 'spiritual', I think there's been enough of that." With her comment she winked at him. He picked up on the slight amount irritation that crept though he glare and voice. Having an idea but not being completely certain he simply looked at her while the corner of his mouth turned up into a half smirk. ***Why don't you just come out and say what you mean instead of beating around the turbo fan. It would make things a lot easier for all of us.*** He simply shook his head.
Standing up off the table when Tar'ja and Nayren did he made ready to go. The still needed the info from Runn on the operative that had lost contact. Hopefully they would have that ready for them soon. They would not be leaving without it. "I'm sure whatever you decide will be fine and you'll catch up." The former Imperial said as she made her way to the door.
He looked at Kasga and then back to Nayren and Tar'ja. A look of confusion was on his face. Why would they need to stay here to come up with a name. Wouldn't be very efficient use of their limited time. **"There's no need for us to stay here to come up with a name. We can do that while we walk to the ship. Besides it needs the ship needs to be prepped."** He smiled at Nayren. **"No need for us to catch up then. It would be a waste of time for us to stay here."** He looked at Tar'ja. **"Besides, like Tar'ja said, being with out my weapons makes me uncomfortable."** He caught her smile and gave her one back along with a wink.
He followed suit with Tar'ja and took to the other side of Nayren. If she needed help he'd at least be there to offer it. Glancing over his shoulder he looked at Kasga. **"So a name for the ship. Have any ideas? I was thinking of *Last Hope.* Kind of fitting with out being to over the top."**

After some debate your group makes it to the hanger bay. Through the corridors along the way refugees line up waiting their turn to board ships away from here. You overhear parts of conversations:
"we are not safe here anymore"
"but mommy I like it here"
"a jungle planet, sound interesting"
"yea I bet there are creatures"
"stow that talk you will scare the children"
"this way move along and you will all be seated"
This station was never built to house civilians for extended periods, plus in the middle of a war it looks as Captain Runn has decided these refugees will be safer on some remote planet. Some of you can not help but to wonder what this new Varbrindi colony will be like and what the future holds for it.
At the hanger Dexter sits on a supply drum waiting. There are a few more ships now mostly transports all awaiting passengers before departing. With the assortment of transports makes, model sizes it looks more like a used ship lot then anything else. The unnamed ship you came in on looks good sporting two new blaster cannons. Both of Sienar manufacture, on top side the other bottom and both on rotating turrets.
You find Lt Tomas Lars near your ship barking out orders to the nearby crews as passengers are loaded into transports. "Ok The next two are ready to go, give the order Sam then lets get more loaded." Turning Tomas sees your group and salutes "Sir, umm Naryen. I will assume your group is ready then?"
Tomas holds out a data pad for whoever is willing to take it "This holds your destination coordinates, we ask that you wait until you are out of this system before opening communications I am sure you will understand the sensitivity of this station." Tomas turns to continue overseeing the passengers departure then turns "I hope you have picked out a ship name. Otherwise entering a system with blank codes only scores you as pirates. You would not last long, we can update the ships codes when ever you are ready."

Kasga steps in beside Chase. **"Last Hope sounds fine."** They walk into the hanger. Kasga smiles to find Dexter there. **"Glad you're here. I'm going to need your help."** he comments as he strides by.
Kasga looks up at the ship and the mods recently installed. With a sigh, he muses, **"Couldn't we have taken the X-wing?"**

Dexter looks at the ship that had saved there lives. It now had teeth. The blaster cannons a top turrent where a welcome addition to her. He had gone through his gear and over everything he was taught to when preparing for a mission. The hope that his friend wa still alive and well was making him impatient to leave. His friends would be along and they would get under way, but the waiting was the hard part.
The hanger that he was pretty much alone in was starting to get busy with civilians being moved to other places and out of harms way. The Captain was keeping up with the flow of traffic as best he could and still keep the place a secert but that was getting harder with the people where running for the Empire. His friends of course enter the hanger and make there away over to the ship. Dexter falls in behind them and tries a little to nit be noticed or make it seem that he was there all along. As the Lt. Goes to hand someone in his group a data pad and explains the need for a ships name and waiting until they are out of system to open commas. Dexter nods to the Lt and takes the data pad and heads into the ship to start pre-flight on the engines and program the navacomputer for the jump to where they needed to be. He didn't want to close himself off to his friends it was still some what painful and he would tell them on route or confine himself to the duties of the ships mechanic until he was needed else where. He nods at Kasaga. "Of course. Was just thinking the same thing myself." He smiles at the pilots next words. "Oh come on at least she is whole again and we can at least defend ourselves if needed. It will all work out, and with you at the controls we will do just fine."

Kasga heads up the ramp following Dexter. As Dexter starts the pre-flight, Kasga looks back toward the door of the cockpit, then intimates, **"I imbedded a scanning program in the sensor maintenance process. It should have scanned for transmissions inside the ship and externally every 2-3 minutes. Can you check those routines first? They might have been removed when the mechanics connected in the new parts. Since the sensors were not replaced, the old logs should be there. Also, If they've been taken out, they'll need to be reinstated if we are to speak freely on board."**

<strong>To a new day with yet another life risking cluster such. Wahoo! &#8230; *YAWN!*</strong>
Naryen ignored the jibe from Chase, at her wanting to get Tar'ja alone, though her irritation did scratch at the back of her mind a little. She made slow progress, through the corridors, as they proceeded to newly named ship though she did so with aware eyes and a small smile. ***"Last Hope"? For who? No pressure!*** She put that aside as they'd likely find themselves on many ships as agents-at-large.
She, once again, found herself swept up in the dynamic of her people, though this time there was mention of a new home. ***We will survive.*** It filled her with hope. Feeling Tar'jas closeness was reassuring but that changed as they went. Picking up on leftovers from the common-room, especially when she caught her looks, she decided to address them. Leaning in proved to be a mistake as she teetered for a moment. She smiled at the novelty of the experience. In a voice pitched low enough to be interpreted as personal but loud enough for her friend to hear: **"Though I'm not sure I deserve it, my condition is self inflicted. They had needs and I have limits. Both were topped out, I hope."**
Seeing Tomas, directing people and taking charge, filled her with feelings she didn't quite understand by fully understood the reactions to it. Her bashful look and flushed skin were more under control when they reached him but still visible. Given everything she'd been through a small voice wondered why she still cared. Naryen noticed the ship as an afterthought. ***Enough for sloppy pirates and I'd expect any more would draw attention.***
She made to answer Tomas, opening her mouth, then paused for a moment with a raised an eyebrow at the "...your group..." then continued, successfully resisting the urge to offer a salute. **"We are ready and I see The Last Hope is as well."** The sentence left her mouth with power and poise, something she actually wasn't expecting given her condition, everything an officer should do. In a more personal tone, addressing his verbal recovery: **"Perhaps, someday, I'll get a rank we can both be proud of."** She winked at him then snapped back to the formal address to help her blush from diminishing. **"I trust my other requested information will be ready before we leave or should we expect that en route by courier?"**

Dexter looks over his shoulder at Kasga. "You sure your not with Spy Net?" Dexter smiles. He had meet beings that took precautions against people invading there privacy. Hell he knew people that would just shot the offender when caught. "Ok.How far did you embed this program? I shouldn't have a problem getting to it I just want a general idea of how much you want to test my skills." Still smiling Dex heads for the the main terminal on their ship, and begins looking for what Kasaga wanted. He also was a little curious as to his friends computer skills. As he always says information is power, and the more he knew of his friends skills the better it would be if the need arose for him to relay on those skills.
((OCC: Computer Use +15, Mechanics check +15 Dexter is interested in the program that Kasaga used and how good he hide it.))

Kasga smirks, **"Not Spy Net. I had a couple of budding security officers in my class when worked on computer languages. They had some interesting tricks to share."**
He heaves a sigh, **"I didn't bury it deep. That's why I'm worried they found it during the install of the new hardware. I was mainly worried we had picked up a hull tag. It's not a test. I'm sure you're better at computers than me."**

### **Yogi** (2010-09-15 23:31:50)

With Kasga giving his ok on the suggestion for the ships name the young Jedi nodded. That was one thing out of the way. Unfortunately the walk back to the hanger was longer than expected. Nayren was spent. Chase could tell that she was tired and until she got the sleep she needed she wouldn't be able to give one hundred percent. He knew of a way to help her but the question was would she trust him enough to let him do it? Deciding to wait till they were under way to ask the question he simply walked along taking in the goings on of the soon to be evacuated refugees around him.
As a practice lesson he opened himself to the Force and let the emotions from those around flow to him. It was getting easier day after day to tap into the Force. Like breathing he couldn't imaging not being connected to all that surrounded him. It was a feeling that he couldn't describe for words alone would not do it justice. Only those with an affinity like his would truly understand what he felt when using the Force.
With his distraction they arrived at the hanger and their ship the *Last Hope* they saw Lt. Lars barking orders. Again like before he emphasized the importance of a name for the ship. Along with that he was holding a data pad with coordinates for the mission. AS he reached out for the pad, Dexter who moved quicker than he gave the Bothan credit for, grabbed the datapad and entered the ship quickly. His surprise was evident by the raised eyebrows as he watched the spy enter the ship. He listened as the Lt. and Nayren talked about the info they had requested. **"The info was probably on the datapad that Dex took. Too bad he didn't confirm it before boarding. But that seems to be his pattern. Act before thinking. Can't blame him right now though.** He looked at Tar'ja as a fairly serious look fell over his features. **"I'd be anxious to get going to if a friend was in trouble."** He gave her a smaller version of the smile that he used only for her.
He shifted his gaze from Tar'ja to Tomas. **"Like Nayren had mentioned. We have decided on *Last Hope* as a name for the ship. Actually no one else had anything else to offer. Might as well get your techs working on the codes. Sooner that's done the quicker we can go."**
He finished talking as he had begun making his way to the ships gang plank letting the others talk. With a few quick strides he ascended the platform. Upon reaching the top he took down his weapons belt and refastened it around his waist. With a few quick adjustments letting it settle in properly he tied the two lengths of leather at the bottom the holster around his leg. Standing up straight his left hand strayed to where his lightsaber was clipped to the belt. Instead of being hidden like normal it swung freely as he moved. The reassuring feeling of having it with him again felt good. Many times had he been reminded by Master Garet, that while the weapon was a symbol of the Jedi, it was also his life.
Looking up he saw Tar'ja's belt and blaster. Grabbing it and turning about quickly he descended the ramp and crossed the short distance to Tar'ja. He lifted up her belt and offered it to her. **"Thought you might like to have this back."** He smiled. Looking at the three of them. **"I'm going to head up and see what I can do to help out."** He turned to Tomas as he looked upon the big human. He held out his hand to the Rebel officer who like Nayren was also a former Imperial. **"Thanks for the help Lieutenant. I do apologize if we have seemed to kept our distance. We've been through a rough time. Take care and may the Force be with you. Tell Captain Runn that the next time we're here I'd like to get a chance to learn a few things from him. Who am I kidding, a lot of things."** He smiled big as he was turning around to make his way back to the ship. He quickly disappeared up the ramp.

As they walked along the corriders fairly quietly, Chase and Kasga discussing the name for the ship, Tar'ja was in thought of the woman beside her and what steps should be taken to ensure they both got what they needed for rest. Sleep would be the priority once everything was underway, Naryen could go straight to sleep, but the twi'lek would do what she could around the ship before going off to get some much needed rest.
They had reached the ship, and the giant male that made her frown. She didn't trust these people, and even though this one was known by the other woman that did not mean he could or should be trusted. Her eyes narrow to him though she's silent beside Naryen, silent guard of sorts.
"I'd be anxious to get going to if a friend was in trouble." She looks over at the end of this sentence to Chase, the smile to his lips brought a warmth through her chest but there were others around. She didn't smile, and though her eyes gave a soft light it was gone in a second; training had taught her, if you loved something, cared for something, adored something, never show it before those you don't trust, and even with those you do, the safest route is to never show it. Then it can never be used against you.
He left, and the two soldiers chatted, Chase return with her belt and blaster did bring a reaction, a faint smirk as she took it and placed it back around her hips, glad for the weight of security, like another part of her had been returned; and all the more reason for her to glare at the giant as she idly tugged at the woman's arm to guide her into the ship, it was time to go, information could be relayed later.
"Come Naryen, it's time for you to get some rest..we could both use it." she had hoped it to be added persuasion that the twi'lek would rest as well, it could work.

Lt Lars nods "Last Hope it is. Sammy enter that into the ships codes." One of the mechanics dressed in red overhauls nods and begins to enter the data into his console. At Kasga`s mention of using an X-wing Tomans laughs "No they are reserved for Pronto squad."
Dexter takes the data pad from Tomas. A quick look reveals system and planet coordinates, your passengers name Jerreb Kov`yan, information on the planet and its system:
Besbooaan
Region: Mid Rim
Climate: Arid
Gravity: Standard
Moons: 3
Length of Day: 30 standard hours
Length of Year: 410 local days
Sapient Species: 80% Human, 20% other
Population: under 5000
Government: Dictatorship (Empire)
Capital: Betwixt Station
Major Exports: Foodstuffs
Major Imports: None
Once a thriving agricultural hub in this sector of space that all ended with a slight shift in the planets orbit. Heavy meteor storms have changed the axis spin on the planet. The resulting catastrophe event has pushed the planet orbit closer to the systems star. This has dried up much of the planets surface water and ended its once prosperous place in the empires food requirements.
During the crisis most of the wealthiest moved on, and after time anyone who could afford to leave the planet did. Now only poor locals remain. Betwixt itself stands as the planets only remaining town and space port. Though only if you consider a single mechanics bay and a small refueling station a space port. Open fields of tundra serve as the ports landing zones.
Betwixt Station also supports a small imperial listening post and barracks. Across the now almost barren planet meager farmers attempt to squeeze a living out of whats left of this barren rock. This planet sees little in the way of traffic these days, but what shipping that does come through must report to the local imperial listening post.
Jerreb Kov`yan: Bothan rebel agent.
Training: Classified
Current Mission Profile: acquire leads on possible resources for use in the rebellion. Currently seeking ways to gain a foot hold within imperial senators trust who control major access to ships, ship parts and ship weapons.
Known Alias: Trevooss feed farmer, Navven V`yann traveling security salesman, others but unknown.
As your group enters the Last Hope you find your weapons as and where you left them. The interior has been left unchanged, the stations crew had time to install shields weapons and a hyper drive but nothing else. The ships engines begin the warm up process just as the ships codes are updated to the new code sign.
Inside the ship both Dexter and Kasga begin to look over the ship, top to bottom. After a while they both find no tampering other then the mentioned ship upgrades.
Looking down the gang plank Chase waves to Tomas, Tomas reply's "Will do, and may the force be with you." Tomas give Chase a salute before going about the task of the refugee relocation mission.
Shortly after the new ships call sign is uploaded you receive the all clear signal to disembark. "This is Port Eclipse station to Last Hope, you have a go for launch I repeat a go for launch."

<strong>Another warm bed and another journey into the unknown. Sounds like a recruitment advert.</strong>
Naryen found herself, again, swept up in the the current of the universe as Tomas didn't seem to respond to her because of his duties to the Varbrindi people. Watching Dexter walk away with the pad, without a word that she could hear, Naryen finds herself a concerned but that lasts for just a moment as she considers her own feelings about leaving her people. The next emotional impulse is quelled almost before it happened. ***Not now, debts to pay.*** Chases seemingly diplomatic effort was appreciated though she knew the two former Imperials needed time they didn't have to discuss the phantoms of the past.
With a nod to Tomas, that she didn't expect he'd return, she made her way into the ship. **He's keeping my people alive, again.** She listened to the sounds of their ship, and those in it, and the sounds of the people in the station that were leaving, as they doing the same. She heard something small from within her. Something that was there before but seemed to just now find it's voice. It came as neither a surprise nor something unwanted. She looked back, to Tomas' back, as she came to terms with the feeling and the thought formed with a serene smile on her face.
***I think I love that man.***
Another voice, that would normally object about annoying school-girl behavior, was far too tired to express anything but soft grunt. The smile remained as she turned back to the innards of their ship and towards the bunks. ***Leave the pre-flight to the others, they're more than capable. You have responsibilities to yourself right now.***
She was light-headed and her surroundings seemed to be move like a living fluid around her. That didn't seem like something that would be healthy to allow to continue. When the other woman's words registered Naryens smile deepened. **"Yes, we both need rest."** She walked with the determined focus needed to stay upright, now more focused since she was offered company. She saw the motivation behind that feeling plainly and revealed it, softly, to her friend:
**"Leaving my people…"** ((( OOC: there is tension on the word **people** that implies additional meaning. Tar'ja should be able to hear a deep emotional connection in Naryens tone, with that word as spoken then. ))) **"…again…"** Her head and shoulders lower under a not quiet imagined weight. "…I'd rather not be alone."
Shortly after they reach the bunks. Naryen walks straight to bed furthest from the door, shoes discarded in a pouch attached to the wall. Taking a spare cushion she lays down against the wall. Her slight form leaves plenty of room on the bed. Looking over her shoulder to Tar'ja, she shares a weak but inviting smile then turns back to the wall.

After he finishes the engine checks and checking the other systems. He had not been able to find the Kasga's program he wanted. It was a matter of time. He looks over the data pad that the Lt. had for them. It had there destination and what Jerreb Kov`yan was doing there. It was a basic info retrieving missions. She was looking for anything that would help the Rebellion. it should have not been a problem for her to keep her cover and not get found out. *"Must have ask the right question to the wrong person. Or someone on the inside let it out what she was doing. Beat someone enough and they will tell you what you want."* Dexter thinks. She would be a hard one to crack, but everyone had there limits. He quickly copies the info to his data pad and walks to the cocpit to hand it to Kasga.
"Here you go. This is where we are headed and the ship is fine. Couldn't find what you wanted but I will keep looking." Dexter hands the data pad to Kasga. "So what you want think of the good Captain?" "I seems like he can be trusted, but the mission that Jerreb Kov`yan was on should have been a blue milk run for her. Unless her contact gave her up to protect themselves or she made a mistake, which she more then likely wouldn't have, or someone in Captains Runn's command gave her up." Dexter was trained to think that he could only rely on himself. Anyone else was either an asset or a liability. It was a fact in his work. He had got to like and care for his new friends. When they either weren't trying to kill him or thinking he was insane. *"All in a days work."* He thinks to himself.

Tar'ja walked beside and slightly dragging the low energy woman beside her. They weren't needed, but at least she had seen the wisdom in that and agreed that sleep would be best for the moment. Passing the Jedi again she offers him his smile now that the other untrustworthy human couldn't see, and follows the small force of nature at her side.
"Leaving my people...again...I'd rather not be alone." The tension to the world caught on the tei'lek's ears, she'd have to ask about that..perhaps not now, later when the mind was more refreshed. Perhaps she viewed them as the twi'lek viewed her the 'family'? For now it's ignored, placed away for later and enters into the bunks. It's here she slows her steps watching Naryen slip into the bunk and smile at her.
A faint, short chuckle escapes the lilac womans lips, slipping off her boots she shifts into the bunk as well. She couldn't really remember the last time she had ever fallen asleep with someone else in a bed...she may never have..hm..did that stuffed animal count? probably not..
A good thing of instinct, that rather than be squished and have her arm hurt later the twi'lek wraps an arm around her friend, her sister, and holds her close; not simply for the comfort of sleeping, but to ensure that the woman wouldn't try to sneak out and not sleep or something. "Sleep Well Naryen..Try not to let worries cloud you for this moment." She whispers softly, no need to speak loudly this close.

Naryens eyes snap open as she feels Tar'ja settle in behind her. She opens her mouth to voice a protest, to insist that she didn't need the attention, when the other womans arm wrapped around her. The feeling of security sweeps over her and the protest is at once vanquished as a breath she didn't know she was holding escapes as a sigh.
Her eyes close as she relaxes, then open welling with tears. A confident voice whispers in Naryens ear "Sleep Well Naryen..Try not to let worries cloud you for this moment."
She smiles as a single tear is blinked from her eye and rolls to the pillow beneath. She adjusts her own arm, slightly, so her hand holds the arm around her and squeezes back a thank-you. **"You too."**
***Debts to pay.***
The patient companion of sleep steps forward and Naryen is dreaming of ice-sailing on Varbrindal moments later.

With a nod and wave in return to the Tomas's salute and parting words The young Jedi hit the ramp controls that began the procedure of closing up the entryway. Looking to his right he watched as Tar'ja lead Nayren back to one of the berths. Both of the women were tired having not slept much in the last few days. ***I hope the sleep does you both well. Not only physically but mentally as well. Demons of the past can be hard to shake.*** Chase thought but he knew that a good nights rest didn't always cure what may be bothering someone.
Turning and walking in the opposite direction he headed for the cockpit where Dex and Kasga were getting the ship ready for departure. He walked in just as Dex was giving Kasga the jump coordinates while giving opinions on Captain Runn what they faced. He cleared his throat before speaking. **"Dex I agree with you about Runn. He can be trusted. Even when communicating with him through the Force I never felt the slightest hint of hesitation or betrayal coming from the man. As far as your friend everyone can make a mistake or place trust in the wrong person only to have it backfire on you later when the chips are down."** He shrugged as he looked out he viewport as the mass of people were milling around being directed by Tomas that could still be seen not far away from the *Last Hope.* **"As far in someone in Runn's command giving her up I'm not so sure. What would you do if you were an agent placed here? Give up the lone spy or take down the whole station that is obviously a thorn in the Empire's side? One that I'm sure they would be happy to be rid of."**
The go from control came through the comm giving them the go for departure. He smiled. **"Looks like your answer may have to wait."** He said as he took a seat and strapped himself in waiting for Kasga's piloting expertize to take them out.

Dexter turns as Chase comments on what he had said about Captain Runn. "Agreed. As far as I can tell the Captain is on our side. It just seems unlike Jerreb to make a mistake like that, but you could be right she may have counted on someone and they turned her in." Dex didn't like going in blind. Not knowing who to trust. Taking a seat and strapping himself in for the launch. "You do realize that if it was some one under Captain Runn's command we could be heading into a trap? It would be best to be prepared for that." Dexter realized that he might be telling his friends something that they might already know, but it was best to get into the open and deal with it.

Just as the last of your group enters the ship the ramp begins to close. With the ramp closed the outside roar of people ends leaving you with only the sound of the ships engines powering up. Even the ships engines seem new, though more likely a recent tune up. From the ships view ports you can still see the people outside move into other transports. The landing bay blast doors remain open as ships load and exit the station passing through only the bay sheilds.
Kasga listens to the station towers query "This is Port Eclipse station to Last Hope, you have a go for launch I repeat a go for launch." As he takes his seat in the cockpit. Opening the comm system the Duros reply`s "Roger that, Last hope ready for departure." With all the current traffic Kasga waits a moment for the towers confirmation.
"This is Port Eclipse station to Last Hope, your launch is a go the other ships will await your departure ... and may the force be with you."
Not use to the term Kasga gives a sideways look to his console. "Thank Port Eclipse station, Last Hope out." The Duros looks around the cockpit, Dexter is focused on monitoring ships systems and Chase merely smiles. "Alright then here we go." The ship lifts off and slowly moves to the bay shield exit. Once outside Kasage pushes the ship clear of the atmosphere. Looking at the coordinates from the data pad Kasaga lays in the course. "We should maintain a watch rotation in the cockpit but the ship will do most of the flying for us." Checking over a few calculations with Dexters help "We will arrive in the Besbooaan system in two days."

When Kasga heard the comments about Captain Runn, he twitched a little. Not Now. He turns back to his piloting, trying to get this crate out in one piece.
Dex hands him the coordinates and Kasga keys them into the astrogation computer. Once he's done, Kasga makes a slow diagonal loop. At three intervals along the loop, he grabs sensor data. Setting an out-system vector, he looks over the transmission data. Ok…good, nothing out of the ordinary there. I'd hate to try and get a hull beacon off while in hyperspace.
Once they were far enough out, Kasga triggered the hyperdrive and Last Hope jumped into hyperspace. Turning around, he says, **"We will arrive in the Besbooaan system in two days."**
Pausing for a moment, Kasga responds to the earlier discussion, **"I'm not sure if I can trust Captain Runn or not. That was what I wanted to talk to everybody about. Things just happened a lot quicker than I expected. I was hoping to talk to him before we left. Also, I thought we might need some other supplies, like a power recharger."**

### **Yogi** (2010-10-03 23:04:17)

With the jump to hyperspase made Chase listened to Kasga as the pilot turned. "We will arrive in the Besbooaan system in two days." The Jedi nodded as he waited for him to continue. He seemed to be deciding on what to say. "I'm not sure if I can trust Captain Runn or not. That was what I wanted to talk to everybody about. Things just happened a lot quicker than I expected. I was hoping to talk to him before we left. Also, I thought we might need some other supplies, like a power recharger."
Undoing the seats belt he looked at Kasga. **"I know you're not the trusting sort but what is it going to take for you to begin to trust him. Both sides are at the same point. They don't know us and we don't know them.** He sat back into the chair. **"All I can say is that the whole time I was there I never sensed any amount of deceit or malice towards us even from Runn. Though he is a lot more practiced than I am so that isn't too hard to believe. If he wanted to hide that from me he probably could. But not everyone else. Take my abilities for what you will but I trust Runn at the moment. I thought that seeing your brothers room had changed your mind somewhat about the place?"**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **galenbd** (2010-10-04 14:01:28)

Kasga smiles, **"Funny, I used to be the trusting sort."** The smile fades, **"Then someone betrayed my brother. And I don't know who."**
He takes a deep breath and looks off into the distance, **"My mind has been changed somewhat. Now I feel the pressing feeling that someone will want me dead to cover their relationship with the Empire. The real problem is that I don't know if that someone is Captain Ruun."**
Kasga begins to rant, flailing his arms around, **"If Captain Runn is not the leak, he could be instrumental to uncovering who is actually the leak. If he is, he is in a position to manufacture evidence that will lead to my court-martial and execution. Additionally, he could use his organization to compromise the Rebellion itself. So do I keep my mouth shut and expose more Rebels to the vagarities of this leak, or do I risk my life for the chance that Captain Runn can stop the leak."**
With a sigh, he winds down, **"I was hoping to make a full report to Captain Runn, but wanted your opinions of him before I did."**

### **Yogi** (2010-10-05 12:48:52)

Chase sat as he watched the animated actions and felt the underlying emotions from Kasga through the Force. His friend was really beside himself with not knowing what to do. To be honest if put in the same situation Chase wasn't so sure either.
**"Well look at it this way. If he is part of the leak he could have fabricated information and had you thrown in the brig at any time we were on the station. Actually he could have done it to all of us. Yet he didn't. Based on what I know I don't think he's the leak. Most likely someone underneath him. The best course of action may be that when we see him again we have a sit down with out any delay and throw all the cards on the table. With just him present, no one else."**
He wasn't sure what else to say to the pilot. This was something that was going to eat at the man till it was resolved. **"You could try talking to Nayren when she wakes up. Which from the looks of it might be a week or so."** Standing up he looked out of the cockpit. **"Actually some sleep sounds pretty good. Since we have two day we might as well rest up. Who knows what we're going to run into there."**
With a nod to Kasga and Dexter chase turned and walked back to the bunk room. The thought of sleep was a welcome one as he took the short walk to the bunks. what he really needed was to sleep/meditate and go through his practices. ***Sleep first then practice.*** He thought to himself.
entering the room he looked at the racks. On one bunk was Nayren and Tar'ja together. Weather it was for comfort or if it had something to do with the strong emotions Nayren was giving off in relation to his Twi'lek friend he wasn't sure. If it was the latter he wasn't sure what he would do till the time came. If it ever did.
Seeing the two huddled close he looked around for the lockers. Walking over and opening one he removed a blanket from the shelf and closed the door as he turn towards the two. He crossed the short distance to the two women. One a former Imperial who as of a few weeks ago would have been a deadly enemy. The other a former slave who despite having a tough emotionless life up till now was discovering many new things that many took for granted.
When the reached the cot he held up the corners and let the blanket fall. starting at their feet he brought up the blanket and let it rest at their shoulders. All the while silently wishing it could be Tar'ja and himself on the cot enjoying the safety that the arms of the other offered. **"Maybe next time."** He said softly to himself. **"Sleep well you two have earned it."** He said as he softly ran his hand up Tar'ja's arm to her shoulder where he gave her a gently squeeze.
Retrieving his own blanket he took the cot next to them and settled in. Running through the mental preparation that was needed he readied himself for the meditation that he often did in place of sleep. It was a quick way to get about eight hours of sleep in half the time.
---
Four hours later he awoke. Stretching and finally sitting up he swung his feet over to the floor. He felt rested as he took a deep breath and stood discarding the blanket on his bunk. Reaching down he picked up his weapons belt. As he put it on he looked to his left. Upon the cot Nayren and Tar'ja still slept. Quietly as possible he left the room and headed to the cargo bay. While it wasn't large it did afford him enough room to do what was needed to keep up with his daily practices with the Force and his lightsaber proficiency.
After several hours of practice both with the Force and his lightsaber Chase had worked himself to a point where a trip to the refresher was gong to be needed. Not just for him but his clothes as well. The practice had gone well. Day after day he felt his connection to the Force growing stronger. When he was completely attuned to his surroundings he knew exactly where each of the others were on the ship. It was a good time to clear his mind and think.
Leaving the cargo hold with his shirt in hand he took the short walk back to the bunks. Again entering as quietly as possible but seeming to fail at it miserably as he made his way to his bunk. Dropping his somewhat sweaty shirt on the edge of the bunk his hands went to work on removing his weapons belt. Where it would also take residence upon the bunk.
He looked over at Tar'ja when he heard some stirring from the bunk she occupied with Nayren. ***Finally waking up. I wonder which one it is?*** He thought as he dropped the belt on the bed. He stood there watching as the sweat that was still clung to his upper body cooled him as it dried.

Tar'ja dreamed, of blackness and nothing.
Passing colors, within the blackness...
it was nice to not really dream...to allow her mind a chance to rest and categorize the new names of emotions that she had been learning.
It felt too soon when sound reached her ears, causing her to stir; how long had she been out? she wondered, turning still waking eyes to the room, and over to a shirtless jedi that made her heart miss beats...and not in a bad way...she'd have to ask him about that one. The woman still in her arms made her feel warm like he did, but he made her heart do weird things..what was up with that?
She slips slowly and quietly from her friend, her sister? those emotions needed to be categorized still.. and rolls to a stand, using the bed next to theirs for support. she rubs her eyes and sighs, looking over the Jedi "How long?" she whispers to him, pale eyes traveling over him, taking in his appearance, the sweat..had they been in a fight? or had he been training..must have been training if his belt was on the bunk as well.
She motions to him, giving him a smirk "I rather like this look."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-05 17:03:27)

A smile crossed his face when it became apparent that it was indeed Tar'ja that was waking up from her needed slumber. Watching her rise from the bed with surprising smoothness and grace, despite just waking, he smiled at her.
**"Good morning."** He looked around the bunk area not seeing anyone else. **"Well it's actually past noon standard time."** He teased her quietly. To which she answers with a whisper, "How long?"
He reached for his duffel and began searching through it. **"About eight hours give or take a few minutes."** He pulled out a white shirt and some black cargo pants for clean clothes to wear after he finished in the refresher.
As his gaze fell back upon her he noticed her pale blue eyes, perhaps the most beautiful pair of eyes he had ever seen, look him up and down. He gave her the smile he used for her though this time it was a bit sheepish. "I rather like this look." She said as his face reddened slightly. A smirk found its way to her face.
**"Well if you like it that much…"** He said softly, gathering some composure, as he walked towards her with clean clothing in his hand. **"You can always join me when I train. I'm sure we could teach each other a few things. Like showing me how to not walk like a Bantha."** He said with a chuckle as he stopped in front of her standing somewhat close. As the chuckle faded the smile remained. **"Actually just a chance to spend time with you would be nice."** He said as his own blue eyes locked with hers.

"Well if you like it that much...You can always join me when I train. I'm sure we could teach each other a few things. Like showing me how to not walk like a Bantha." He moved to her and her eyes simply watched, unable to look away, or unwilling to.
The smirk remains on her lips as she takes a small step to him, closing the distance between them with a brush of her hands against his chest and up to his shoulder, resting there "I wouldn't mind that...learning more about what makes you what and who you are..." she chuckles softly "might be nice to have someone keep up with me in the shadows too." She grins at him, giving him a wink.
The moment was perfect, she didn't really know why or for what it just was, instinct knew that much, even the person behind her on the bed was just a fading memory. "Maybe...after your shower? a little calmer training?"

Dexter waited to speck until Chase had left the cockpit. He was right. Kasga needed to work through this so that it wouldn't distract him from what was needed to be done. As Chase left. "I would hate to admit it, but he is right. You need to get this resolved some how." Dexter eyes move back to the controls front of him. The readouts told him that the hyper drive was functioning normally. He and the tech had done a good job of putting it in. "Well everything is green across the boards, and those three are crashing out. Working in shifts might be a good idea unless you think you can stay awake for two days straight my friend." Dexter had planed to go back sometime and get some rest. For the moment he needed to be up to help with anything that might arise. He also needed to go over the data on what had happen to his friend and classmate. He settles into his seat and starts to go over the info on his data pad and if they where far enuf out he might check a few other sources he had here and there.
After about 5 hours had passed he figured it was safe to head back and rest. Besides it took awhile sometimes for his contacts to get back to him. he had thought about contacting his superiors at Spy Net but that might give away where he was and what was going on. Besides they had to have known what had happened by now at any rate. "I am heading back for some shut eye Kasga. I can send someone up to relive you if you'd like?"
((OCC: Don't know how you want to do any contacts that Dex might have made. Let me know. Other wise Computer use +15 and Mechanics +15. Gather information is a +15 as well I think.))

The small step she took brought her closer to him. Watching as her hands rise he anticipated their touch against his skin. As her fingers and hands gently touched his chest a shiver ran up his back. When they continued upwards to his shoulders her touch felt like electricity every inch of the way. "I wouldn't mind that...learning more about what makes you what and who you are..." She chuckled as she was talking. "Might be nice to have someone keep up with me in the shadows too." She added with a wink and a smile.
He smiled at the wink glad that maybe she was beginning to pickup on some of the new things she was experiencing. "Maybe...after your shower? A little calmer training?" He wasn't sure if it was the tone in her voice or the touch of her skin on his but he found his hands coming up behind her, slowly pulling her closer. His eyes never left hers as the inches closed between them. **"Half the Imperial Army wouldn't be able to stop me from meeting you for that."** He said with all seriousness as he bent down and gave her a soft lingering kiss. There was no hiding his passion as his arms finished encircling her as their kiss continued.
Breaking the kiss a smile found its way to his lips. **"I better hurry up and get to that shower or I'll end up here kissing you for the next half hour. Not that i would complain."** He added the last part as a whisper as he began to pull away from her. Not wasting any time he made strides to the refresher for his shower. **"I wont be long. Maybe we can relieve Kasga up in the cockpit. He's probably been there since we left."** A second later he was through the door to the refresher.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-10-05 20:27:06)

He was so close to her...the feel of his arms around her...how was it that he could make her feel as though she were being shocked throughout her body yet nothing but his skin touched her? He had shivered...had he felt the same when she touched him? "Half the Imperial Army wouldn't be able to stop me from meeting you for that." That brought a shiver to her spine, head tilting and eyes closing on instinct to the kiss.
her hands move up to wrap around his neck, holding him to her as her lekku rose and fell, how could one body hold so much emotion...how could someone else hold such power without the use of being a master...These things were so strange, but in this moment she didn't care anymore. The ship could have gone down for all she cared in this moment.
There was a whine when he pulled away, was that from her? "I better hurry up and get to that shower or I'll end up here kissing you for the next half hour. Not that i would complain." that didn't sound like a bad thing... She almost said as much when he pulled away from her, oh how she didn't want him to go..."I wont be long. Maybe we can relieve Kasga up in the cockpit. He's probably been there since we left."
Ahhh Kasga...work...for once she had no real need or want to work, she rather contemplated simply going to the refresher after him, she could use a shower...That through had her moving to it but she stopped herself, closed her eyes and rather swiftly fled to the cockpit, better to get out of there in that moment of sanity before she do something she wasn't really sure if she was ready for, or was in a good place to do with a sleeping Naryen near by.
Moving into the room the twi'lek pats the bothan on the back with a smirk, her gaze moving to the Duros "kasga, I'm relieving you, get some sleep." She didn't ask, it was more of a, get out now I have company coming, sorta of thing.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

<strong>To a new purpose. Sorta.</strong>
Naryen was back on the glaciers, ice sailing again. The solar converter built into the sail was making the repulsor blades hum against the ice. She loved that sound. The sun was warm and the air spiced with spores from the mountains. The wind was refreshing and the clouds were...
A very particular purple.
She smiled. ***Time to get to work. Thank you my friend.*** The purple flashed from the clouds to the rest of the sky as Naryen focused her memories and she bent her universe around her. The colors swirled to her fingertips, laying a spectrum between her hands and with a flick of the wrist and a turn to the left she was standing back on Port Eclipse station looking at Tomas directing her people.
And for a moment he was naked. She had him back in the last uniform she saw him wear. The one that gave his eyes a purpose she hadn't seen in a long time. A purpose that also ran deeper than she had ever seen it before. Suddenly all she could see was his eyes and his smile. Her smile diminished as she re-focused and wiped her surroundings clear with some irritation. Her neck felt a little itchy.
***I'm really going to have to deal with that.*** Her eyes twinkled and she smiled, a little.
She ran the faces back across her awareness, appraising each one complete with the attached body language and everything she knew about them in an instant, reinforcing it's memory. The emotions that her people pulled from her waited off to the side, a cloud that churned with sparkling energy. She smirked a little, poking at it playfully from time to time. If it was possible to giggle with light and texture, this cloud did. ***That's a nice change.*** Usually her emotions needed to be corralled. The itch got more intense.
She turned the ship inside out to so it looked like a vine-fruit from home. Green and yellow but instead of the flesh there was conduits and bulkheads. She didn't see enough of the ship for an accurate lay-out but it was a nice distraction. She hadn't done this in a while so the playfulness was showing. Not nearly as cold and controlled. Dexter ran by, dressed up as an ice-phantom being chased by squealing toddlers. And loving every moment. ***I need to make some time to talk with him.*** Her neck became even more persistent.
After getting some work done she played some more with the sights and sounds. Vigilant for anything different that her subconscious had picked up on and filed for her for later she also knew she shouldn't stay long. It was an extensive training but the result was amazing. Harnessed lucid dreams were just starting to be investigated at the Imperial Academy and she was their choice... test subject. ***Fools.*** She scratched at her neck letting herself relax in the way that wakes her, succumbing to the need to scratch the itch.
And her finger caught on a familiar collar edge. As the images faded around her she looked down to see she was wearing her old Imperial uniform. That didn't surprise her but the large metal mirror that appeared in front of her was a surprise. Her reflection looked... different. Her awareness was slipping, typical of the experience, but something wasn't right. When her brow furrowed a little and her reflection remained unchanged, she knew and her eyes widened in alarm. Her fingers pitched down on the collar edge.
***That's not me.*** the meaning was dual and disturbing.
Her reflection smiled at her and for an instant Naryen felt the mirror was actually ice she was trapped under. She felt cold and she looked up to see her face smiling back. A smile she didn't recognize.
With a final ripple and a swirl Naryen opened her eyes and pulled a blanket edge from her neck.
Still smiling.
Immediately she picked-up that she had company with her in the room. She changed as little as she could and simple listened to voices both familiar and comforting.
***Interesting.***

Entering the fresher Chase set this clothes down on the bench outside the shower and quickly began to undo his pants. Stopping for a second he looked over his shoulder to the door. Inside his mind he was secretly wishing that the door would open only to have Tar'ja walk though. The thought brought forth emotions and stirred him into the action of removing the rest of his clothes and quickly finding what sanctuary he could inside the shower.
As he lathered up the memory of her wouldn't let go. Her lithe body so close to his flashed though his mind. His eyes closed as the soft touch of her lilac colored skin remained in the fore front of his memory. The showers water beat down upon his chest as he stood there. How easy would it be to have her in here right now as hands explored each other.
His body shivered as he reached for the temperature controls. The emotions he felt were strong. Perhaps the strongest he had even felt. ***Control Chase. Get some control.*** With slow movements that became quicker he continued to clean himself up. All the while thoughts ran through his mind. The mission, Runn and his station. The others and what they have recently faced or will face in Dexters case.
Again Tar'ja appeared in his mind. Did she feel the same way as he did? It would be easy to find out. All he had to do was open himself up to the Force and pick up on her emotions but he hadn't. Her response to his kiss and the shiver he felt run through her body just moments ago told him things also. The thought caused his own body to shiver again in response as that feeling shot up his spine. Now that he was finished lathering he again reached for the temp controls and let the almost ice cold water hit him on the head and relished the cold tingling feeling that rolled down his body.
Stepping out he grabbed for a towel to dry off and quickly ran it over his hair and body. Just under two days remained on the ship. That fact brought a smile to his face. ***A chance to spend time with her. Know her better in a situation that didn't involve life and death. That's not too much to ask for is it?*** As he asked himself that question he reached for his clothes and put them on. Within a couple minutes he was all finished. Looking in the mirror he ran his hand over his chin. A days worth of stubble had grown. With a shrug of his shoulders he resigned to taking care of it tomorrow. After all Tar'ja was waiting for him. Taking his clothes and the used towel he put them into the refreshers cleaning unit.
Exiting through the door he looked around the room. Nayren was still on her bunk with the blanket he had placed on her and Tar'ja hours ago. She had moved slightly from when Tar'ja had gotten up from the bed. Probably from the fact that there still wasn't a warm body providing comfort.
He walked over to his bunk and picked up his weapons belt. Looking around sighed. No he didn't need it right now. It was time to relax and recover, they had all earned it. Still he removed the lightsaber from the ring it was attached to. Setting the belt back down on the bed he examined the weapon before placing it securely into one of the deep leg pockets on his pants.
Turning around he looked at Nayren. Something was tingling at the back of his head. She looked like she was still asleep but it didn't feel right. Reaching out with the Force his suspicions were confirmed. He smiled to himself as he turned slightly and took a few steps towards the former Imperial. She hadn't been sleeping long considering her recent ordeal. Standing a foot from the bed he spoke softly. **"Nayren, it's only been about eight hours. Feel free to go back to sleep. The four of us can keep an eye on things. We'll all have time to talk later. We still have about forty hours of hyperspace travel."** He turned to go but paused for a second giving her time to respond or turn back over and go to sleep. He knew what he wanted her to do but didn't verbally admit it as he wondered just how long she had been awake.

<strong>To a new purpose. Sorta.</strong>
The Jedi addressed Naryen in a tone that immediately irritated her. Something he had said earlier now resonated in her head like a siren. She rolled towards him and glared, for a moment. His carelessness was really grating on her all of a sudden.
**"I'll get up and walk around."** It was more a declaration than even conversation as she slid into a seated position on the bunk and looked to the floor. **"Get cleaned up first."** That was more to herself than anyone. **"Kasga wanted to talk, I'll listen."** The name didn't seem to come out as naturally as before. She scowled slightly at that.
She stood and made way to the refresher station in the next room. Pausing at the door she says in a voice low but with a noticeable amount of tension, perhaps even anger. **"About you showing off your abilities."** Now with more force, **"The next time you feel the need to give child refugees from the Empire a rumor a Jedi hunter would find interesting, to draw more attention of Imperial forces,…"**
She whirled eyes sharp, piercing cold, menacing. Her features were a contrast of fire and fury and her voice matched every nuance of what blasted at Chase. Her mouth snarled the word like blaster-shot:
**"Don't!"**
Spinning her back to him, Naryen stepped into the refresher area and closed and coded the door for privacy in a single action. She was disrobed and in the refresher almost instantly after. The chaos of the water beating on her features and the same in her mind was a storm she lost herself in for some time. Occasionally she would cry with internalized rage as some significant part of her wanted to kill that fool Jedi for exposing her people to such supreme risk. ***The innocence of children! A resource the Empire has become experts in exploiting! Varbrindi children!***
With clenched eyes that fought and failed to hold back tears of rage, fists at her temples and head back baring clenched teeth, she used the motions of the water to try to calm her. Her hatred also found its way into her as she ravaged herself for not doing more herself to keep her own people safe from the Empire and careless people that have as much hunting them as herself. ***Why must I keep failing!***
She ran the system for some time, letting her rage have it's way so she could be done with it. For now.
In a weakened daze she finished cleaning and obtained robes from a drawer. In the mirror she found everything flushed so her eyes didn't stand out, save for the slight pink of having cried. Naryen felt shame in her weakness and vowed to be stronger for the people she had let down.
She released the privacy lock and left the refresher through another door and slowly wandered the ship familiarizing herself again with its sounds vibrations and layout. Eventually she came to the bridge area where she suspected the rest had gathered since she found them nowhere else. She stood there and quietly observed the others.

As Nayren rolled over her glare made him pause. ***What did I do now.*** He thought. Lately it seemed that everything he did seemed to set her off and he was generally on the receiving end of her wrath. With a few short words, not seemingly directed at anyone, she sat up looking at the floor. Already open to the Force he could feel the shift of emotions in her. A shift that bothered him. ***There's more going on that she's telling. There has to be some other source to her anger.*** But to be honest he didn't know and feared that her dislike and growing hatred towards him would be a continuing and maybe even larger problem for their small group.
He took a step back as she stood to give her room to move. Moving by quickly she headed to the refresher where she paused before entering. With her back to him she spoke. As he did he felt the rise in tension and anger flow off of her. It was an experience that bothered him. "About you showing off your abilities." She paused but resumed with more force in her tone. "The next time you feel the need to give child refugees from the Empire a rumor a Jedi hunter would find interesting, to draw more attention of Imperial forces,..." Now there was no hiding her anger and maybe even hate towards him. "Don't!" She said in an feral tone as her face matched the emotion expressed.
The shock on his face if she even bothered to notice was there evident for anyone to see. Quickly he recovered as her prevailing emotions continued to buffet him making his own frustration with her rise. As she spun around he found his voice before the refresher door closed. **"Make sure it's a cold shower Nayren. Maybe it will wash out the anger and hate you hold within. After all those are the emotions that your former Emperor holds dear to his black heart."** He knew he should not have said the last part but it was too late now. Not waiting for a reprisal from her as his own anger was beginning to rise he turned quickly. He was no more than two strides away before he heard the refresher door lock. ***Good stay in there for the whole trip.***
He left the room behind him and leaned on the bulkhead taking several breaths in order to calm himself down. Nayren hate had affected him more then he thought. He ran a hand through still wet hair and shook the water from it as he took it away as he reflected what he had done with the two children as he shook his head. All he had tried to do was bring a small amount joy into their lives that had been turned upside down by the Empire. He felt his calmness returning to him but it did nothing to change what had been said by either.
Pushing off the wall he slowly made his way to the cockpit walking a bit faster when he thought of Tar'ja. He didn't remember seeing Kasga in the bunk room or the refresher so he figured that the pilot was still in the cockpit with Tar'ja. **"Well group talk now or later doesn't really matter does it?"** He said softly as he silently wished that it would only be the two of them up there. Though with Nayren up now that was unlikely to happen. He felt his ire rise and again as he once more found himself running through the technique to restore calm to the body and emotions.
His not so soft footfalls announced his arrival and upon reaching the cockpit door he looked inside. Hoping to only see Tar'ja he hid well the disappointment of also seeing Kasga. ***So much for some alone time with her. Who were we fooling other than ourselves on a ship this small.*** He took a few steps in standing close to Tar'ja who was sitting in the co-pilot chair. **"How's the ship?"** He said as he placed a hand gently on her shoulder. Before either could answer he added. **"Nayren is awake."** He said with some trepidation as he could still feel the hate and other emotions spike and run the gambit through their friend. Closing himself off to it he tried a smile but it didn't come out as freely as he would have liked. His hand, that was on Tar'ja's shoulder, gave her a gentile squeeze.

After talking to Chase and Dexter, they left him to his ruminations. He set the Last Hope's alert system to audible and settled back into the pilot's chair to think. No one else seemed to share his concerns about Captain Runn.
He turned it over in his mind for hours. Still unsettled, but feeling like he had no options but to confide in Captain Runn, he determined that he wanted Naryen's opinion. I doubt she'll have something new to consider.
Eventually Tar'ja came back. She seemed annoyed to find him there and offered to relieve him. I guess Chase will be here soon. Shortly, he showed up too and informed him that Naryen was awake. Kasga was about to wander back to find her when she came walking up the corridor into the cockpit.
As Tar'ja was distracted, Kasga answered, **"Ship's fine, Ma'am. It would be good to take some time to sweep it for listening devices. I also need to talk to you about Captain Runn soon."**

"Nayren is awake."
those words, suddenly all the feeling and the happy thoughts that she had going about taking some quiet time with Chase turned with a sigh. "Is she? how is she?" she asked, when all she really wanted was to find some nice hiding place for her and chase to just have some time together. Was that so much to ask?
And then she entered.
Yep...that was too much to ask for.
Turning pale eyes to her friend she offered a smile, sad though..why did she seem so.....off..
The smile turns to a frown as she gives the woman a look as though to ask silently if everything was alright. her hand moving to rest upon Chases.
Talking with her would be good...that would leave this area free and quiet. *Go on…go on then..* she silently told them.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-11 22:11:23)

He gave Tar'ja a reassuring smile when he saw her face change about Nayren awake. Her sigh echoed his own thoughts. Especially now after their brief exchange just moments ago. "Is she? how is she?"
***How is she indeed. Good question.***
Watching her shift her gaze and he knew Nayren was just outside the cockpit. ***How are we going to work together? She'll never trust me.*** He thought as Kasga got up and left them. When he felt Tar'ja's hand on his he looked down and smiled. Her touch seemed to make things better. When Kasga began talking to Nayren he took a few steps and took the pilots seat. The whole time he never let go of her hand.
Looking outside to where the two had begun speaking he sighed and gently squeezed the hand he was holding. Looking back at the beautiful woman infront of him he nodded as her pale blue eyes looked deep into his. His voice was low as he spoke. **"She's fine I guess. Full of anger and hate though and it's mostly directed at me. A few words were said. I shouldn't have let her get to me but the anger and hate was so strong. I reacted and not in a way I should have."**. He sighed again as he shook his head. **"She doesn't trust me. I don't think she ever will."**
He ran a hand through his still wet hair as he found himself giving a soft chuckle despite the situation. **"So much for some quiet time with each other."** He squeezed her hand again as his eyes softened some.

Tar'ja gives his hand a squeeze in return with a sigh, would they never get along? Was it still about what he was? they were all part of a Rebellion now...when would the prejudice end for all classes and races.
The twi'lek had thought that in this type of organization that it would all be over. That everyone could work together and not fear for anything between each other.
"Give her time." She says softly to him, squeezing his hand "she's been through a rough few days..more so than us on the station." She glances over to the door at those that were talking "and our time will come around when they all leave." She glances back to him with a smirk, and a glimmer of his smile in her eyes.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-11 23:45:32)

He mulled over her words about giving her time. ***Give her time. How much time id she going to need. We have to work together now.*** He knew that she had been a lot. More than any one person should have to endure. Not to mention that she hadn't really slept enough to recover from the ordeal. "And our time will come around when they all leave." Her words that followed brought a smile to his face. Looking up he saw the smirk that she gave him. **"On a ship this small. You're more of an optimist than I am."** He said in jest as he held her hand simply enjoying the touch of their hands together.
He looked out the door that she had just been looking through. His smile faded some as he looked back. **"Maybe she was right, what she said. I shouldn't have done that, showed my ability, with those two children. "Showed off" as she put it. Exposing them to further danger. But if you had seen them Tar'ja, the look of sadness on their faces you would have done something to make them smile also."**
He smiled again as he looked back to the doorway. and heard the voices out there. **"Well if they come in they come in. We'll just have to make use of the time we have together."** He gave her a wink as he locked eyes with her again. **"Patience we must have, yes patience."** This time he smiled big. **"If only I had a credit for every time I heard Master Garet say that. Always was I ready to rush off and do something. Till I finally learned that having to wait for something, more often than not, makes it worth more when you finally achieve it.** Despite his words he still had the slight feeling of grabbing her hands pulling her into his lap and kissing her. ***Patience young Chase, patience. All in good time.*** The words of Master Garet again rang through his head as he looked at what he believed was the most beautiful woman he'd ever known.

"Maybe she was right, what she said. I shouldn't have done that, showed my ability, with those two children. "Showed off" as she put it. Exposing them to further danger. But if you had seen them Tar'ja, the look of sadness on their faces you would have done something to make them smile also." The twi'lek nods her head slowly in understanding "did you tell her that? that they were sad and unhappy and you brought joy to them again?" She glances to the door and back "I do not know much but I do know that most feel some sort of need to see happiness..and to take care of their own, I read on that once...perhaps that's what her outburst was..a need to protect."
She shrugs faintly and sighs "I do not pretend to be an expert on this...but I believe...you did well." She nods "she would have done the same if she had the ability..maybe that's why she's upset.." she muses with a hum.
The turn of conversation to his master makes her watch him more, concerned these memories would be harmful to him, but no..it seemed they were good to him. "I would have liked to have met your master..he seems wise by what you say.." She glances to the door then back again, smirking as she stands and moves to sit in his lap comfortably, checking over the instruments before turning back to him "don't mind do you?...it's alright..if they come in I know of a refresher we can hide in for a while." She chuckles faintly, she felt herself loosening up around him more...Naryen was bringing that out in her as well but Chase...something just made her want to relax..to be someone better than what she was..damaged and unsure.

### **Yogi** (2010-10-12 07:32:03)

Nodding his head as Tar'ja spoke he agreed with what she was saying but something in the back of his mind still told him to be wary for Nayren. That anger and rage she held within was strong. More so than even he would have thought. Maybe she could tame it get it under control, diffuse it.
"I do not pretend to be an expert on this...but I believe...you did well." She nodded as he looked up at her. "She would have done the same if she had the ability..maybe that's why she's upset.." She mused with a hum.
**"I hope so."** He said softly. His tone may have indicated that he wasn't completely sure but he couldn't hide the look in his eyes that showed that he really hoped that was the case.
When the topic changed to Garet she was surprised to hear her say that she would have liked to meet him. He nodded again. **"He was a good man. His wizened status came from many years of experience. Something I wish I could call upon now."**
He was looking at her hand which he still held as a flicker of movement in front of him caused him to look up. Her head was turning back to him from the door as one of her lekku shifted and fell from her shoulder. He noticed the smirk on her face as she rose quickly from the seat.
He leaned back a bit as a small step had her standing right next to him. With an ease and grace that surprised even him she was quickly perched in his lap. His hand came up to rest upon her back as the one lekku that fell from her shoulder now laid against his arm. Shifting slightly to look at the controls and what he surmised as finding a comfortable spot she looked back at him when satisfied the ship was still in the green. "Don't mind do you?" His eyebrows shot up as he shook his head quickly as he felt an arm come across his shoulders. "...it's alright..if they come in I know of a refresher we can hide in for a while." She said with some amount of seriousness that was followed by a faint chuckle.
His other hand came up to find hers where he interlocked his fingers with hers as the hand on her back moved to her side only to pull her in tighter. He smiled as he looked up at her slightly. **"No I don't mind at all."** He said softly as he began feeling her lithe body relax against his as he held her close. **"It's a good thing I noticed the refresher has a privacy lock on it."** He gave her a flirtatious wink.
He didn't need the Force to feel the tension leave her body, his own physical senses told him that much. Holding her just a little closer he gave her a quick kiss then pulled away to rest his head on her shoulder. **"I don't know if you know this but you are pretty amazing."** His hand let go of hers as it moved to encircle her. **"I know I can't possibly understand what your life was like before but I do know this."** He said as he hugged her. **"You are stronger for it. You would not be who you are today if it wasn't for those experiences. It's what you are that draws me to you. The fact that you are also beautiful doesn't hurt."** A sigh of contentment escaped him as he was holding her tight. Removing his head from her shoulder he looked at her with his own blue eyes. **"Does that make sense to you?"**

As she settled into his lap, comfortable position found and ship to her liking, he shifted with her, holding her close. if someone had told her..years ago, that she would ever allow anyone to do this, to hold her this close, to hold some power over her to make her relax and that she wouldn't mind it...she would have shot them for such stupid words.
Yet..here she was, and she didn't care in the least, she was enjoying this...she liked being able to relax in his presence, she liked the feel of his arms around her..who would have ever thought.
"It's a good thing I noticed the refresher has a privacy lock on it." he said, a tone in his voice spoke of flirting, that made her gift him with his smile, her lekku twitching with the one on his arm trailing along his arm. "All the more reason to use it." She smirks and leans in to kiss his cheek, brushing her nose along his skin, in that act of intimacy that she had seen once before.
Privacy lock...while it would give them a good place to hide away she wondered what else they might use that privacy with...maybe she's actually join him for that shower she had thought about. The thought made her smirk to her self, lekku twitching again as a faint pink entered her cheeks.
"I don't know if you know this but you are pretty amazing." her arms wrapped around his neck to hold him close to her, the statement wasn't something she had expected. "I know I can't possibly understand what your life was like before but I do know this." Good feelings felt like they were leaving, why bring up the past...why now.. "You are stronger for it. You would not be who you are today if it wasn't for those experiences. It's what you are that draws me to you. The fact that you are also beautiful doesn't hurt." The confession....oh...how that had made her feel so good, she had no idea that someone else would see that in her, she knew it..that it made her strong..what was that saying? what didn't kill you made you stronger. Well it hadn't killed her, like she'd let it.
She smiles to him, eyes turning warm as her hand moves to his cheek, brushing along his skin with her fingertips "thank you..." she says softly to him, watching him, "Thank you." well he certainly deserved it, her lips molding to his in a light kiss, pulling back again just mere seconds after.

As he was speaking her felt her body tense as she sat there in his lap A sense of uneasiness from his words. Yet when he finished that tenseness he initially felt from her was gone. He had been speaking from what he felt within. When he looked at her he saw the strong woman that stood before him. Not the former Twi'lek slave that she once was.
When he lifted his head he saw her smiling. It was the best smile she had ever given him which was reflected back at her. Her blue eyes turned inviting as he felt the soft touch of her fingertips across his cheek. "Thank you..." She said softly looking into his eyes as she repeated the thanks again. She leaned forward slightly as her lips softly met his for a gentile kiss A few brief seconds passed before she pulled away which caused him to let escape a soft moan that only she could hear. He didn't want the kiss to end.
He opened his eyes to see her still smiling at him and he was thankful that this wasn't all some sort of dream. He pulled one hand away and raised it to her face. Once there the back of his fingers gently brushed against her cheek and then trailed down the lekku that had fallen between them. **"That kiss just simply wasn't long enough."** He teased her with a wink and the half grin he used just for her.
***Not long enough indeed.*** He thought as her flirtatious response to the privacy lock echoed in his mind. ***All the more reason to use it.***
He leaned in closer and whisperd as his lips gave her soft kisses along her cheek to her ear. **"Sitting here with you makes me wish this was a two week trip and not two days. Soon we'll be back to buisness."**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-10-12 15:16:44)

Tar'ja chuckles faintly, hardly any sound leaving her lips to ruin the moment they were sharing. "Aye...too short.." she says softly closing her eyes when he leans in to whisper, relishing the feeling of his breath against her skin. Oh ancient ones had she fallen hard and without even realizing it.
"Sitting here with you makes me wish this was a two week trip and not two days. Soon we'll be back to buisness." she grinned and whispered back in return "just lets us plan for when we finish and return to the ship...more places to hide there." She grins gazing to his as it falls again to that warm smile of his.
She wasn't quite sure what she was feeling, but it made her stomach flip over and her heart speed up, it made her feel warm even in space...maybe this was that love thing... With the thought in mind she promptly kisses him again, letting it linger this time for however long they'd like it to last.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-12 22:29:09)

"Just lets us plan for when we finish and return to the ship...more places to hide there." He liked her idea for after the mission. The station was huge and it was true there would be many places to find that would give them a chance to be alone.
He watched her look at him and the smile on her face was the best he's ever seen from her. He was sure that his heart was pacing just as fast as hers. And despite his attempts to close himself off to the Force so he didn't pick up on her emotions it was impossible not to.
He felt them come off of her in waves similar to his in strength and kind. He held her tight relishing in knowing that she also had strong feelings for him. ***Could they be the same? Can she feel my heart pounding in my chest?*** He thought as his heart began to quicken in his chest as she leaned in closer letting her lips brush his. This time though she didn't pull away as the kiss lingered softly against his lips. His arms encircled her again as he felt the rising emotions between them build as their kissing became more passionate. To Chase it felt like hours had passed though it was only a few precious moments they shared.
Breaking the kiss he stopped for only a second as he began slowly kissing down the smooth line of her neck to the nape where it met the shoulder. Taking a deep breath, in effort to calm himself, his exhale escaped over where he had just been kissing the lilac colored skin. Reaching for her hand he found it and placed it on his chest. With his hand over hers he held it there letting her feel the pounding of his heart deep within his chest. He smiled as his breath came quick. **"My heart is pounding. Can you feel it?"** He whispered. Blue eyes alive as they drank her in beauty.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-10-12 22:39:51)

Oh how his kiss seared at her soul, caused her heart to beat uncontrollably in her chest, the fire erupting in her belly and spread throughout her body, her cheeks flushed as they kissed. When it broke she was panting for air she hadn't realized that she had lost, looking to his eyes, pale hues darkened from this passion between them.
He took her hand to his heart and asked if she could feel it, how could she not? it was bounding like a thousand banthas...just like hers... "I..I do..." she says between gasps of air, taking his hand to place over her heart as he did "Do you feel mine?" She asked him.
This was what he had been talking about...wasn't it? these feelings, emotions, the heat and fire...the tenseness and relaxation all in one....was this how he felt? how could he...her....anyone...live with so much emotion in the heart? How could they not die from this feeling? "I feel as thought it may jump from my skin.."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-13 08:07:48)

Two sets of blue eyes shared the depths of the other as quickened breaths came to both bodies that sat ever so close to each other. The look on Tar'ja's face when she felt his heart beating in his chest showed her surprise. Seemingly as if she couldn't believe the effect she was having on him.
Feeling her remove her hand from his chest caused him to look down. He watched as he reversed her grip an lead his hand to her own chest placing it above her heart and holding it there. "Do you feel mine?" He raised his eyes up to her as he felt her heart pounding in her chest as if it wanted to break free. A smile formed as he nodded to her. **"Yeah, it's racing."** He answered in lightly spoken words. ***Her heart is racing just like mine. Does she feel what I do?*** His mind raced.
Leaving his hand where it was over her heart he pulled her in close with the other. He could still feel her heart beating beneath his hand. Still pounding like it was just moments ago. "I feel as thought it may jump from my skin.." She said just above a whisper for him to hear. Her voice sounding incredulous as if this couldn't be happening to her.
Nodding in agreement he chuckled softly, barely any sound escaping, as he shifted his position slightly in the seat while giving her a soft kiss upon the cheek. **"Mine feels the same way Tar'ja."** His hand traced small circles up and down her back as he whispered to her. **"The feeling is incredible isn't it? Now do you see why I had a hard time explaining it?"** His grin widened as the light in his eyes danced with desire for the woman he had fallen for.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

"So this is it then?" She asks him softly, Lekku twitching again and again as she listened to the sound of his heart beat from his neck as she rested her head to his shoulder, brushing the tip of her short nose to his skin, lashes moving against his neck when she shifts her head and blinks.
"This is what love is?" She sighs softly "how do people live like this..." she asks, "does it always feel like this? always as though the heart is trying to escape? always with fire under the skin?" if this is what it was...if it was always like this...she didn't know if she could work..could live with that feeling all the time.
Then again...she didn't feel it before she had moved to his lap..maybe it was only like this when...they were close and..what was the word? intimate? She could live with that.
"Love..." she says softly, tasting the word on her lips. She could...live with this, so long as it was him.
She smiles to him, lifting her head to kiss him again softly, already her heart rate was slowing again with the short pause, so it was only when things were like before. That was manageable!

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-13 12:53:00)

"So this is it then?" He heard the question asked of him. The feeling of her head resting on his shoulder could not be described. The tickling sensation that her nose and eye lashes made him crane his neck a bit but settled down when she settled in. Finally he nodded his head as he held her close. One hand grabbing the wrist of the other as they rested against her side where a solitary finger traced figure eights upon her hip.
He listened to her talk trying to figure out what she was feeling. What their intimacy had brought forth in emotions. "How do people live like this..." The question softly asked as her warm breath moves across his neck causing goose bumps to spring up all over his arms. "Does it always feel like this? always as though the heart is trying to escape? always with fire under the skin?"
He shook his head. **"No, not all the time. I don't think much would be accomplished if people had that feeling all the time, every day."** He felt a lekku twitch against his arm and let one hand move to gently traces circles on the lilac colored skin that was exposed. He closed his eyes as he let his head rest against hers. He sighed as he pull in his Force sense and just sat there with the woman he had fallen for perched on his lap. If he could have his way he'd stay here with her for the rest of the trip to Besbooaan. He knew that was wishful thinking.
"Love..." He heard her say softly, just loud enough for only him to hear. Smiling he leaned back farther into the chair letting Tar'ja lean more against him. Kissing her head he softly echoed what she had said. **"Yeah, love."** Feeling her head begin to move he bought his eyes to hers only to see that smile she only seemed to use for him. Tilting his neck slightly he felt her lips brush against his again. This time with a gentleness that left him wanting more. His pulse was slowing down as they sat there holding each other.

Dexter heads back to where the bunks were located near the fresher. As he made his way back he got the sense that he might not be wanted or someone was wanting alone time. *"I hope Chase and Tar'ja have a chance to make it work. My last relationship didn't go that well."* Dexter smiles. He did want them to find happiness. He walks past the bunk room and finds a spot in the common area and covers up with his cloak and tries to rest as best he can. He would clean up later. He closes his eyes and hopes the dream that haunts him will not return tonight. Maybe he dream of happier things. A few minutes later he drifts off to sleep, and he dreams of the time he spent with her and times they had.

Tar'ja sighs faintly against his lips. This was nice..calm..relaxing..no heart trying to leave her chest now, that was nice...
Pulling back away from him again she trails lilac fingers along his skin, then up through his hair..Hair was strange, she never really understood the need for it it just looked like it always got in the way.
Maybe though the skin wasn't as strong as hers to protect the brain..maybe that was why there was hair..a reasonable explanation in her mind. "I like hair.." she says softly, marveling at the soft feel of his, was all hair soft? She have to test this question on naryen sometime.
Which then brought up a slightly unwanted thought, Naryen had been quite close to her since she had returned to them, and the growing hatred between her and him...ho was she to feel about this? Her expression shifted, looking to the door then back to him whispering softly to him "Naryen?" she asked, what were they going to do about her if she didn't like him this close to her?

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-14 13:14:18)

Chase smiled as he felt slender fingers trace their way along his skin. The gentile contact made the hair on his arm stand up. Their movement continued up along his upper arm past his neck and up into his hair. Once there her fingers ran through his hair that was now mostly dry. His eyes closed as her fingers moved through his blond hair.
"I like hair.." She said softly to him. Opening his eyes he was greeted pale blue eyes that were looking at his hair as she ran fingers through it.
**"I like it when you do that. It feels good."** He spoke quietly as he smiled.
He raised a hand up to her head where he started to let a finger trace its way down one of her lekku. Her skin was soft to the touch and it made him wonder if her skin held the same softness all over.
"Naryen?"
The name was spoken as a question and he knew what she was getting at. With a sigh his hand ended its tantalizing trail on her lekku and came down to rest on her thigh. He remained quiet for a moment as he searched her eyes. Looking into them he realized that despite how they came together that finding Tar'ja and discovering the emotions they shared for each other was a once in a lifetime occurrence. He recalled a lesson that Garet gave him in the weeks just before he died. ***Nothing comes easy Chase especially the things that mean the most to you. Sometimes its just the will of the Force that things happen the way they do.***
He looked to the door for a second and then back to Tar'ja. **"Nayren indeed."** He whispered. **"She is your friend. Mine too I hope despite what has happened in the past few days. Maybe its the stress from loosing her home, the refugees, her interrogation by Runn and his people. She's lost basically everything she has known"** He shrugged his shoulders. **"I do know that she feels a bond with you. I think it has to do with that you are both basically starting over, new lives that have been separated from the past."**
He brought up his hand to caress her cheek and looked into the eyes that he fell for weeks ago. **"I don't know. For all of my abilities I don't know. I guess we take it one step at a time."** He whispered. **"They already know something is going on between us. To attempt to hide it would be foolish on our part. Not that I want to."** He added with that smile he used just for her.

<strong>To a new purpose. Sorta.</strong>
(((OOC - in the interest of time (many meanings there) I'm going to assume some things.)))
Naryen thought about Chases seeming childish outburst, like he didn't even consider why she was upset before reacting. The ignorance of a child being scorned without knowing why. She heard his voice and Tar'jas from the bridge and felt herself go rigid. ***Don't!*** It was her own voice in her head, an echo of what she spat earlier. She relaxed in shock to her own reaction and let it express itself. ***Don't get in the way of her learning for herself. You respect her more than that!*** she smiled and walked another route back to the common area.
(((OOC - I don't recall if there is more than one route around this tub but it works better this way given how much time had past.)))
***Perhaps Kasga is prepping to bunk-down.*** She hurried her pace to catch him, the last thing she wanted was a fatigued pilot.
She stopped abruptly. ***Or a distracted one. Frak!*** She considered going back to the bridge but thought better of it and proceeded to the common area. She arrives to see Kasga already cleaned up and getting ready to turn in.
She smiled a warm hello and said **"Now or later?"**

Together they sat in the captain's chair simply holding each other. Neither moved nor talked as they relished the simply fact that they were away from the others. As away as two could get on a small freighter that also carried three other people. It was times like this they would have to make the most of what was able to be taken for themselves. Weather it was simply holding each other, talking, or sharing an intimate kiss between them.
Chase found himself smiling as he rested his head against hers and thought about the kiss that had shared. How it made is heart beat in his chest like it was going to explode. The emotion she stirred within him was stronger then any he had ever experienced. It was frightening yet exciting all wrapped up into one. Bringing up a hand to her face he let his fingers trace slowly around her ear. He always thought the ears on a Twi'lek were intriguing. He wondered if kissing around it would produce the same feeling that it did to a human. ***Hmm something to find out later.*** He thought as his finger traced lower down the back of her jaw line. Her features were strong yet feminine. Lilac colored skin, the likes he had never seen before, was soft to even the most gentile of touches.
As his finger drop lower past her jaw down to her neck his finger was stopped by something. It was metal and Chase realized it was the choker she wore around her neck. It was the one thing that stood out when looking at her. It didn't really belong. It spoke of a time gone past. A history that was better left in the dusty corners of ones mind. She was already stronger for her experience if one wanted to call it that. Why be reminded of it everyday weather if be from a glimpse in the mirror of hearing it clink when it moved.
**"Tar'ja,"** He said softly as his finger ran across the black choker and fiddled with a link that hung from it. He silently hoped that he would not offend her. Slowly he moved his head so he could look at her. His bright blue eyes searched her pale blue orbs. He wanted to understand where she came from. What made her who she was. **"Why do you still wear this? You set yourself free."** the look on his face was honest, inquisitive. Wanting to know more.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-10-15 20:17:38)

Tar'ja had closed her eyes, simply listening to him breathe and enjoy the faint caresses of his exploration of her face. She shivered lightly at the feel of the play around her ears, lekku twitching again as she smiled. He was a curious one..then again she couldn't quite blame him, he was fascinating as well. That hair...and his ears...odd shape those, how could they really be useful? they looked like they might get in the way or something..and what if he wore a helmet..wouldn't that damper his hearing?
His fingers roamed her jaw, that felt good actually..who knew she had a spot there that liked being touched. And down her neck it goes, shivers falling off her back; he must be enjoying himself with what he was bringing out in her, that had to be why he kept doing them.
And then he paused and something jingled.
It didn't bother her much anymore to hear it jingle, but his question actually made her take pause, turning to look at him as her own hand moved up to brush fingertips along the leather and chain "It's a reminder." she says, not soft, not happy; rather distant and thoughtful, a tinge of hatred behind it.
"Of all that was taught to me and all that was kept from me that I have to learn now.." If she really gave it thought, or saw someone who knew of the mind, they might tell her that she held on to it because she wasn't a full person yet, she was still half; half a slave, half a lost child trying to learn for the first time by themselves.
"I'm never free." she says softly, until the galaxy was free and she didn't have to pretend to be a slave just to walk in some areas, she would always be a slave, and if not careful, this collar would be replaced with another one.

The ship holds steady through the trip. The crew back at the station did a great job on the upgrades and overall maintenance of the ship resulting in only minimal crew supervision. As you leave this sector of space and near more traveled space routes comm traffic picks up. Mostly sensor beacons marking local systems as your ship passes by.
The engines are running smoothly with only minor adjustments here and there. So far this new to you ship has turned out to be a real deal. Throughout the ship your group try`s to make due with this new beginning, though some are less receptive to change.
Chase and Tar`ja sit in the captains chair building on their new found relationship a chime on the nearby console breaks the mood. Your ship has just received an incoming hail, the origin is blocked and no ID has been transmitted by the sender.

### **Yogi** (2010-10-16 00:16:38)

**Cozy on the bridge, hours into the trip**
"It's a reminder." He heard her say softly as her hand rose to the collar. He voice was calm but he could see in her eyes that there was still a bulk freighters worth of emotion behind the expression.
He tilted his head to the side slightly as she continued. "Of all that was taught to me and all that was kept from me that I have to learn now.." He nodded his head slightly not responding verbally but instead let his other hand rub her back in an effort to comfort her not knowing if he was doing any good or not. He was beginning to have second thoughts about asking her about it. So much had been kept from her. She knew so much and yet so little at the same time like she was two sides of a coin. She had so much to learn like he he did about her and she about him.
"I'm never free." She finally said after a brief pause. He didn't quite follow her meaning and his confusion showed in his face slightly.
**"Tar'ja,"** He said softly as his hand took hers and held it tight. **"I would never be able to imagine you being anything but free knowing what I know of you. You are a strong woman who I don't think would ever allow someone to hold power like that over you again. At least not willingly."** He gave her hand a squeeze and looked deep into her eyes. **"And I promise you that I would never treat you like that. And may the Force protect anyone who tried because not only would they have you to contend with but me as well not to mention the others."** He spoke softly as he his head nodded. A cool tone had entered his voice conveying just how serious he was and how much she meant to him.

Tar'ja sighed faintly and shook her head "I'm not free still Chase." She said faintly "true. I wouldn't go willingly or without a fight but...still have to play a slave to walk in certain areas, that's not freedom." She shakes her head "not until the galaxy is changed." her resolve was stead fast though she sighed and leaned her head against him.
A chime on the console catches her attention, making her roll her eyes "what now." she mutters in annoyance, wanting to get back to the nice part of this and not the empty memories. Still..Chase was with her...that was something.
"No ID..no Origin.." She frowns and looks back to the Jedi before hitting first the com for the rest of the ship, moving into the co-pilots seat "Incoming Hail, no ID no Origin, Answering." She hovers over the switch to answer the hail before looking to the Jedi "you talk." She says and answers the hail, keeping quiet for now.

"I'm not free still Chase." She said faintly "True. I wouldn't go willingly or without a fight but...still have to play a slave to walk in certain areas, that's not freedom." She shakes her head, lekku following suit. "Not until the galaxy is changed." He could hear the steady resolve in her voice and he knew that this wasn't just a simple feeling that she held on to. This was something that went to her very core.
He felt her sigh and once again laid her head against him. His arms engulfed her holding her tight trying to provide some sort of comfort as his hand rubbed her upper arm. He angled his head and spoke softly into her ear. **"Then we'll have to see what we can do to change the galaxy one step at a time."** They weren't empty words. The tone in his voice held the same conviction hers did.
They sat there for a few more moments till the console chimed. Tar'ja moved in his lap as he saw her roll her eyes. He smiled knowing that she was irritated that their time was interrupted. "What now." She began muttering as he examined the incoming call.
"No ID..no Origin.." She looked back at him frowning.
**"That's odd."** He said as he shifted at her movement as she moved to the co-pilots seat.
"Incoming Hail, no ID no Origin, Answering." she into the ships internal comm notifying the others in back in the ship. He finger moved to the answer button as she looked at him. "You talk." She said quickly as she hit the answer button. ***This ought to go over well with Nayren.*** He thought as he cleared his throat.
**"This is the *Last Hope* go ahead.** He said holding off for a moment before sending out the ships transponder signal which was normally a standard procedure. He wanted to wait for a moment to see what came through from the other side. He shifted his gaze to look at Tar'ja a they waited.

Kasga looks over at her blearily. He pauses a moment to gather his thoughts. Heaving a sigh, he begins, **"I had wanted to have this discussion before we left. Things moved rather faster than I expected. I have had some trouble trusting Captain Runn."**
He lets that hang in the air a moment before continuing, **"I can't recall if I told you that the Reaper mission on Tantooine was compromised. The important part of that is that I did not tell Captain Runn. While he knows Reaper squad was shot down, he does not know that the mission was blown before we fired the first shot. Given the extraction we are currently on, that information might alter his future plans."**
On a roll, Kasga reveals his true anxiety, **"If Captain Runn is the source of the leak, I might pay for revealing it with my life. If he's not, Captain Runn is in the best position to root out the leak. I guess, the true question is if I risk my life, or continue to risk the lives of the other Rebels under his command. I had hoped to garner everyone's opinions of him before we left, so I could make my full report if warranted. Circumstances have conspired against me."**
Kasga's diatribe is interrupted by Tar'ja announcing contact with another ship. Kasga frowns because of the interruption and the suspicious nature of the hail.

Watching Kasga respond to her Naryen immediately regretting disturbing their pilot. She was about to excuse herself when he started to talk and then seemed to bolster himself. ***Very well, go ahead.***
She listened intently as he expressed his concern over the seemingly compromised security of a squad attached to the Rebels. After a moments contemplation she smiled, shrugged and said **"Life is risk."** She opened her mouth to venture something further when Tar'ja advised, via intercom, of an unknown contact and the rather peculiar choice of announcing their position by responding to them.
Naryens eyes widen and she looks to Kasga with a shocked scowl. **"Runn can wait, it seems. You'll have to elaborate about Reaper squad later."**
She moves out of the bunk-room then to the bridge at a hastened pace. ***I hope they at least scrambled our location in the reply.*** A tug at her guts tells her that she suspects otherwise and tries to move faster to the bridge.

Tar`ja opens the incoming hail and merely states "you talk." Her only response from the hail comes in a common mono tone automatized response found in many computer programs "Agent Jessek input code for verification." The message is relayed verbally only once but appears in text on the console screen waiting for the requested code.
The ships course remains unchanged, and is still in hyperspace. Curious your group thinks most ships can not receive messages while in hyperspace. The ships nava computer shows about one day left in your travel time before you reach your destination.

Tar'ja looks over to the Jedi at her side, shrugging her shoulders as though to say she had no idea what the message was talking about. Had they entered a secure sector of space? Were they believed to be this Agent? what was going on here? She had a feeling that the others would be up soon and ended their side so they were free to speak when they arrived.

"Agent Jessek input code for verification."
***Dex? Who would be looking for Dex?*** He thought as he exchanged looks with Tar'ja as the automated message was playing. What puzzled the young Jedi was that they were still in hyperspace. He raised an eyebrow as she turned off the audio on their side enabling them to speak freely.
**"We're still in hyperspace. They must have installed a hyperspace transceiver when they added all the other systems. That's the only explanation I can think of."** 
He reached for the internal comm button. **"Dex get up here on the double. Whoever it is they are looking for you."**
He looked back at Tar'ja, a surprised expression evident on his face. **"I wasn't expecting this."** He said with raised eyebrows.

Dex wakes from his rather pleasant dream to Chase yelling at him to come forward and look at something. "Coming Dad." Dex raises and moves to the cockpit. "What is so important that you had to wake me from a rather pleasant dream." He looks over at the comm station. "Ah, the info I requested is here." Dexter enters his Spynet ID number and voice print in Bothesse. While waiting for conformation "This should help out on the mission. Information is power, but sometimes it takes awhile for them to run all the ID checks." He rubs his eyes and yawns. "Always hated the waiting part." He pulls out his data pad to write down what he would need to know as the information was relayed to the ship. "I had a cousin that worked on in a comm station on this arctic moon. The assignment is for those not qualified enuf for field work" He starts to program and comm system to randomly switch signals every few seconds. He try a few of the tricks he had picked up from here and there to keep others from listening. In Bothesse. "I need some information on Jerreb Kov`yan. I was supposed to meet her a while ago to catch up on old times, but can't find her. Any idea where she is these days. Oh and keep up with the signal chances, just like to keep my skills sharp." Dexter continues keeping others from listening in other then those on the ship.

Tar'ja blinks slowly at the bothan then over to the Jedi and back again, the hell was the bothan talking about? This information had been for him? "Dex..did you make a call for something from our ship? our ship what we're on a mission for of a sensitive nature?"
She couldn't believe the gall of him...hell how did whoever he call get information to them in hyperspace?? Naryen was going to be furious.
Leaning back into her seat she watches the Bothan, arms crossed over her chest, leg crossing over the other "Dex. who did you call. And what is that." They weren't questions, they were demands. He had interrupted a very lovely time between her and Chase, and now the others were on their way, Kasga may not have even gotten enough rest yet!
She turns pale blue hues over to chase "Naryen's going to be pissed." she says simply to him.

Hearing Tar'ja's concern about what he had done. "Don't worry, I took pro cautions and used my sources to get this information. I know what I'm doing." Dex continues working at the comm station. "If your worried about it, you can take whatever pro cautions you feel are necessary. You trust me don't you?" he turns his attention back to his work. "I am sorry if I didn't talk to anyone else about this, but I figured the more we knew about who we were after and where we headed would help out.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-10-22 00:11:09)

Chase sat there with raised eyebrows watching Dexter as he spoke. It didn't seem to bother the Bothan one bit that he didn't inform them that he was doing this. He shook his head as he shifted his gaze to Tar'ja and shrugged. When his blue eyes locked her he didn't need the Force to see that she was angry with Dex. He had stepped over a boundary and he wondered if he even realized it.
Knowing that he had nothing to do in this he simply say back and listened as things played out. Watching Tar'ja as she sat there at least gave him something to focus on other than Dex. The long smooth lines of her legs as they crossed held his gaze for a long moment as he half listened to her give him the third degree on what he was doing.
"Naryen's going to be pissed." Looking up from her long shapely legs he saw the frustration in her eyes as she was talking to him.
Nodding in agreement he shifted in the captain's chair as he cleared his throat. **"Most likely. At least it won't be me in her cross-hairs for a change."** He said as he gave her the smile he used between them.
Dex looked at Tar'ja as he continued to reassure her it was safe. "....I am sorry if I didn't talk to anyone else about this, but I figured the more we knew about who we were after and where we headed would help out."
**"Dex we know that the more we know the better off we'll be but you should have told us. Considering the mission, how it was handed down and the sensitivity of potential spies within the organization we just became a part of…we should have known what you were doing. We have to work together or we can't function as a team."**

"I understand that part of it my friend, and as I said I am sorry and will try harder to be team player in the future. I guess when you work alone as I have or with one other person you just get used not always informing others when you take actions." Dexter realizes that he is going to have to consider the bigger picture and his team more often now or , Tar'ja do some rather nasty things to him in the future. "Thought I do have a question for you guys. Have either one of you guys been where we are headed? Any first hand knowledge of the location would also help." Dex hands Chase his data pad with there destination called up. "Figured in your dealing and travels you might have been there once or twice." It was a long shot that they had been there, but sometimes these things panned out for you. General intel was good but interment knowledge of a place was as sometimes better.
((OOC: Basically just asking if they have been there considering Chase being a Jedi, and they do travel a lot around the galaxy. If the GM won't allow that is cool as well.))

<strong>At the door to the bridge of the Last Hope&#8230;</strong>
... flabbergasted.
Naryen arrived at the bridge after Dexter and after what sounded like a confrontation, given the seemingly apologetic tones she was hearing from Dexter. Thus far she was able to gather this was their Bothan lone-gun was expecting. To his question Naryen cleared her throat, to announce her presence, and replied with a question herself.
**"Where are we going again?"** It didn't sound as sarcastic as she had wanted but her posture and expression should make up for it. With crossed arms and leaning against the doorway Naryen, looked every bit the part of someone who was looking for answers far beyond the question she had asked.
***Full disclosure or will I have to ask I wonder.***
She made a point of not looking at Chase though her mouth was a little more tense than she'd like. She tried to relax it but one of her hands was gripping her arm a little too tight as a result. She sighed inwardly at herself and focused more on Dexter to try to redirect some of the tension.

***Cockpit of he last hope. Ain't we just one big happy family.***
Chase took the offered datapad and began to look it over as Dex continued to try and smooth things over between them. Looking at the information he shook his head. He had never been to or heard of Besbooaan. He opened his mouth to respond but was cut off by Nayren's voice coming from the doorway.
"Where are we going again?" Her voice held a slight bit of sarcasm that was easily picked up on. ***Still in a foul mood I see. I guess the shower didn't do her much good.*** He thought as he looked at her and noticed her posture. ***Yes that's more like it.*** There's was the look that didn't quite fit with the tone he had just heard. It wasn't hard to notice that she didn't look at him.
He shook his head slightly at her seemingly childish actions. They had to work together and the sooner she realized that he wasn't her enemy the better. Ignoring him wasn't going to make the problem go away. They needed to talk, preferably before they reached Besbooaan.
He took the datapad that Dex had handed him and offered it to Nayren. **"Here. It has what Info Dex has on the planet and what we were given from Runn."** He said with a even but friendly tone. If he had to be the one to pave the way to some kind of understanding between then then so be it.

Dexter apparently garnered them a bit more information. I wonder if it will be worth the risk he took getting it. Kasga followed the escalation of tension in the cockpit with little concern. The commander will care of it, or she won't be command for long

Dexter looks up from the comm station. "Sorry Naryen if we woke you. I was checking with my contacts to see if there was anything else to be gleaned about Jerreb and what she was doing. I figured more information would be useful. I am waiting for ID confirmation now." Dexter hoped that she would understand the need for him to do his job. If she didn't he would have to double his efforts to prove his usefulness to his friends. "Did you sleep well? I grabbed a couple of hours in the common room the seats in there are no bunk." Dexter yawns deeply. "I have to get some caf after I am done here." Dexter goes back to what he was doing and waits for ID check to finish.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **master_Tru** (2010-10-26 18:37:18)

Dexter inputs his verification code the screen blinks instantly then begins to stream text. As the text moves across the screen it disappears giving only a short time to read its contents. The next thing you take notice of is that this is a timed message, meaning someone entered it into the ships computer and set it to deliver at a set time. This also answers the question of if this ship has a hyperspace transceiver.
With the origin of the message Dexter feels little need to secure the channel as there is no chance of it being intercepted. Dexter does notice that this is the first time the message has been accessed, which means that only you and the originator know of its contents.
Reading through the short message its origin become clear. "Agent Jessek the retrieval of agent Kov`yan is of high priority. You are to take any and all steps necessary to ensure this agents return. To assist you on your mission 2000 credits have been transferred to your account." With that the message is over.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2010-10-29 18:16:02)

Dexter trys to read through the info as it flashes by on the screen then it was sent to the ships computer to be given out at the right time. "Well I guess the good captain is not the only one wanting Kov`yan back. Spynet has ordered me to do whatever is necessary to get her back." Dexter was working for two masters this time and both expected results. "We also have some extra funds to help. I info is in the main computer. It is time coded so we can not see it until the right time." Which was a little strange, but someone thought it to be necessary. Dexter signs off and leans back in the chair. He wondered what Kov`yan was working on that was important enuff that warrant this level of importants. He stands up and heads back to the common room. "I need that caf now." He says to no one. He seemed to be pondering something in his head.

She smiles at Dexters greeting **"It's fine and it was a needed nap, thank-you."** She glanced at Tar'ja for a moment with a deep and genuine smile then to Dexter to see what he was doing. When he leaves she nods back to the cockpit, as a means of dismissing herself, then falls into step with her Bothan friend.
Reviewing the pad as she went she speaks her mind: **"Perhaps you should get proper bunk. There may not be a chance once we arrive…"**
After a brief pause, **"… if not we can talk about the message you got and background here?"** lifting the pad to into view for emphasis. **"I have a feeling there is much I need to be briefed on."**

Tar'ja frowns as yet again, she and Chase were left alone after very little conversation. Shaking her head the twi'lek crosses her arms over her chest, looking over to the male "Well...this is certainly fun." she says rather sarcastically.
Turning pale blue hues to him she relaxes slowly into a smile, moving from her seat and back into his lap, wrapping her arms around him "now...everyone's gone, Dex isn't causing trouble anymore, and we have a while still....where were we?" she asks, him, getting comfortable

**Bridge of the last hope**
Dexter rose quickly when the message ended. Leaving the cockpit he headed back for some caf and to go through the data that he had just received. Nayren followed suit in leaving the cockpit but not before taking the datapad that was offered to her. He let out a small sigh as he looked at Kasga and then leaned back into the captains chair.
"Well...this is certainly fun." Tar'ja's voice made him turn his head towards her. The sarcastic tone was not lost on him. Once again things between him and Nayren were still up in the air but when he locked on to her eyes again all thought of Nayren and even Kasga who was still in the room were set aside. Watching her stand from the chair he smiled as she took the two steps to him and eased herself in his lap. "Now...everyone's gone, Dex isn't causing trouble anymore, and we have a while still....where were we?" She said softly as she began wrapping her arms around him while shifting her weight to make herself comfortable.
The smile on his face widened as his own hands came up. One starting on her back running down to her outer hip while the other ran slowly up her tone muscled leg only to join his other hand and pull her in tighter to him. He brought his head close to her own allowing him to speak softly to her as the warmth of his breath flowed across her neck. **"I think we were right about here only we're not quite alone yet."** He said with a bit of humor in his voice.

### **zerah** (2010-11-02 16:41:42)

Tar'ja blinks at him curiously then turns her gaze to those still present. She chuckles faintly, so thankful to have the bothan out for a while and Naryen not trying to hit you I suppose I forgot." She winks lightly, instinct, or learned; she wasn't sure which. She rests her head against his, looking to his eyes, "what should we do from here then? wait for them to go or..run off elsewhere?"

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-11-02 17:10:15)

He smiled as she winked at him. She seemed to be picking up on things more. He gazed into her eyes as she rested her head against his. Being close to her was intoxicating as her voice greeted his ears.
"What should we do from here then? Wait for them to go or..run off elsewhere?"
He craned his neck slightly to give her a light kiss upon her lips. ***Real alone time. Could me really manage that on this ship?*** One corner of his mouth turned up as he gave her her smile. **"Running off elsewhere sounds real nice but…"** He paused for a quick second. **"Who will keep an eye on things up here?"** Chase said as he softly rubbed her back.

Kasga smiled at the couples confusion. **"My watch is done. I thought Tar'ja was the next watch. Why don't you guys stay here. I'll go grab some bunk time."**
Kasga headed out of the cockpit trailing Naryen and Dexter deep in conversation over the data Dexter had retrieved. He checks the ship's computer for an estimate of when they come out of hyperspace. He sets his alarm for 2 hours before the hyperspace exit and sacks out in his bunk.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-11-06 14:13:28)

Tar'ja blinks lightly, other people? she glances over to Kasga as he stands to make his exit. Waiting for the door to close she smirks back over to the Jedi she was using as a chair "I don't see anyone now." She chuckles faintly and kisses him again.
Kissing was nice. she rather liked this, well.with him, she didn't think she'd let anyone near her like this unless it was him.
yes. just him.
Pulling away she sighs faintly and nods her head to the door "Naryen still seems to be...ignoring you."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-11-06 22:19:07)

The young Jedi yet out a slight groan as she kissed him again. Now that they were alone in the cockpit he didn't worry and just enjoyed the private moment they shared.
When she broke off the kiss he heard her sigh as she indicated the door with a nod of her head causing one lekku to slip off her shoulder.
"Naryen still seems to be...ignoring you."
He let out a sigh of his own as he followed her gaze to the door. **"I know. Until she can find some was to trust me I have a feeling it's going to be like this for some time."** He ran a hand through his hair letting it fall where it rested on her leg. **"What if she can't get past what I am. It doesn't bode well for our team if we can't all trust each other."**

A frown crosses the twi'lek's lips as she ponders that, what would they do? "If she can't get past this..then that's her own fault We are all on the same team, the same side. she needs to learn" she pokes him "same as you. It might be best that a..conservation of power is addressed around her unless completely necessary. With exception to that saber thing."
It might be the best way, let the woman grow into the idea of it to where the twi'lek herself was...well...not completely like she was. The thought made her chuckle as she runs her fingers through his hair, she liked that.

### **Yogi** (2010-11-07 09:06:21)

**"Don't tickle"** Chase shifted quickly when she poked him as it hit him in just the right spot causing his to let out a small grunt. He smiled when he looked back at her as her words repeated in his mind. He nodded his head but stopped when she began running her fingers through his hair. Causing him to press his head into her hand even more enjoying the feeling her caress brought to his senses.
**"I know Tar'ja and I will. Only when necessary."** He said with closed eyes. A small groan escaped as he was concentrating on what she was doing to his hair. **"I like that you know. Keep it up and I'll be unable to resist you."** The inflection in his voice was one of a teasing nature as he wrapped his arms fully around her and held her close as she continued to run her fingers through his hair.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-11-08 02:15:59)

Tar'ja blinks in surprise, tickle? must have been a sensitive spot, she filed that knowledge away for later use. Pale eyes watch him enjoy the attention to his hair she was giving; that look of bliss and the sounds he made..she liked being the one to inflict them, to draw them from him.
She chuckles faintly, leaning in to ghost her lips against his in a mock kiss "I'll simply have to keep it up then." She says confidently.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-11-08 09:59:28)

Opening his eyes just in time Chase sees that she is close and feels the playful kiss against his lips. "I'll simply have to keep it up then." He heard the confidence in her voice as she spoke. That in and of itself was exciting.
He leaned in just a bit and kissed her, letting his lips linger against hers, as she continued to run fingers through his hair. **"Yes keep it up. Not the tickling though. Do that and I'll have to respond in kind."** It was then a mischievous grin formed as a hand moved up her side to her ribs. **"Actually…"** He said the word slowly and let it trail off. **"That sounds like it might be fun."** A finger on his hand moved as it gently dug into her ribs.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-11-08 11:52:49)

A strange sensation shot up her ribs when he placed his hands along them, eyes wide the sensation grew it was...was....she didn't know what it was but it was making her squirm. She eeps, surprised that had come out of her lips, and squirms in his lap to get away from those fingers and the weird sensation they were inflicting. She laughs once, briefly, 'wh..what are you doing??"

---

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-11-08 12:15:16)

As his lone finger gently pressed into her ribs he felt her squirm. knowing that he had a good spot he added in his thumb and applied a little more pressure. the result was instantaneous as she an eep escapes her lips. The look of surprise on her face was golden. He began to laugh along with her as she continued to squirm on his lap.
Stopping his torturous assault he smiled as she looked at him. "Wh..what are you doing?"
The young Jedi's fingers twitched once more along her ribs as he answered her. **"I tickled you."** The grin on his face was back as he was enjoying this new found knowledge of her. Though he began to wonder what the price for such knowledge would be.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-11-08 12:46:42)

She squirms again, attempting to leave without actually moving from his lap; it was comfortable, why would she leave it? But that damned...tickling! She bites back a laugh as she flicks his ear to stop him, the tickling continues and instinct instructs her to fight back...granted not fully, as she was only pushing at his hands

---

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-11-08 13:20:45)

Chase Stopped tickling when she flicked his ear moving his head to avoid another thwack. Making a grab for the attacking hand he finally grabbed it on the second try. Holding fast he intertwined his fingers with hers. **"Ok, ok I'll stop. No more ear flicking please."** He said as he continued to laugh gently letting her other hand move his away from her ticklish side.
He took a deep breath and let out a long sigh as he looked into her pale blue eyes. **"So you're ticklish and I'm ticklish. I wonder what other discoveries we can find out about each other with our limited time here?"** He brought up his other hand and traced a finger up across her cheek and then let the back of his fingers trail back down her soft skin. ***Yes chase you certainly are in trouble here*** He thought while being drawn deeper into her eyes.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-11-08 13:33:37)

Her fingers entwine with his, twitching as he brought his hand up to her cheek but she fights it, she didn't want to not feel his touch or have him afraid to. She sighs and leans into his fingers, eyes closing with a small smile, his smile.
"I'm sure there's lots we have to discover.." her eyes open again to gaze to his "sensative spots, secrets, dreams..thoughts..so much to learn..."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-11-08 16:44:57)

Chase sat there enjoying the moment the two of them were sharing. What she had said ran through his mind. They did have a lot to learn about the other. Not only physically like they had been doing but emotionally as well.
**"You're right Tar'ja there is a lot we have to learn about the other."** He continued to sit there just simply holding her in is arms close to him. He wanted to enjoy this while he could since as soon as they arrived at the mission destination he knew they would have to wait a while to do this again. Lifting his head from her shoulder he locked eyes with her. **"Ask me a question. Any question you can think of and I'll answer it for you."** There was sense of happiness in his voice as he spoke.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2010-11-08 16:57:25)

A hum escapes her as she ponders that, but there was one that came to mind "what were your parents like?" she asked, family...real ones, the ones she saw have dinner together in her lessons, she wondered always what it was like; were real parents strict? were they nice? did they buy presents? go on trips?
"and your master! what was he like! was he kind? was he ruthless and strict? did he beat you with that glow rod if you got something wrong?"

### **master_Tru** (2010-11-08 20:33:01)

Your crew completes the journey to the Besbooaan system. The ship enters normal space inside the system. Sensors on-board come alive scanning the the nearby planets. Readings come across the ships computer. The scans show the planets in the system, as well as a ping response from an imperial sensor buoy.
The sensor buoy sits on standby running passive scans until it finds a signal like that of your ship. The imperial buoy runs a direct scan on your ship and sends an automatic query requesting only the ships destination. A simple reply with the ships name satisfies the lone imperial buoy.
Your ship closes in on the small brown planet of Besbooaan and enters it atmosphere. Only a single transponder continuously signal relaying information on safe zones to land a ship. Judging from the planets small population the transponder is most likely unmanned.
As the ship enters the atmosphere you notice a wide open flat landscape. Mostly barren, dotted with small towns and moving animal herds. Following the transponder beacon you land just outside the largest of the planets towns Betwixt Station. You land the ship just outside town, the series of safe zones the planets beacon directed you too are all vacant.
Outside the ship dust blows wildly across the landscape. Few individuals can be seen from the ship. One local sits sleeping outside what looks like a cantina. The two speeders you can see look like older models. No one greets you, no one meets your ship as it lands. The information the ships computers has on this planet shows it to be imperial controlled though no guards are visible, and no imperial bases can be seen within the small towns buildings. One building in the center of town shows a small communication array on its roof the rest of the buildings are constructed of local materials or prefabricated drop buildings used in everything from temporary mining operations to early colony buildings.

**In the cockpit of he last hope**
A smile came to his face as she exuberantly began asking questions about his family and Master Garet. ***Family I figured that topic would come up. She never really had one before. Makes sense that she'd want to know what one was like.*** As he thought more about his parents his smile faded as his gaze wavered and fell to the controls to his left. A memory came back to him one he had hoped he had forgotten about. It was one that happened almost three years ago.
--------------------------------------
**"Chase don't!"** He heard his father say pleadingly as he has finished packing up the last of the things he was able to pack away. Hoisting up the duffel, his mind made up, he made his way past his parents to the door of the home he lived in. It was a nice home in a good neighborhood. Why would he want to leave **"Chase!"** His mothers voice was shrill as it always was when she was upset. **"If you walk out that door to follow that fool old man Garet…"** Her words hung in the air as he hoped she wasn't about to say what he thought she was. **"Don't bother coming back."** The words stopped him dead in his tracks bringing up his head as he had hit the control pad to open the door.
He half turned to look mother and father who had moved up to hold his wife. **"I've always been different, we've all known that. Now I know why. I know you don't understand or don't want to understand but I can't stay here, not any more. Goodbye."** Turning back he took two steps and stopped. **"I love you both."** He said barely loud enough for them to hear before the door closed cutting off his mothers screams behind him.
--------------------------------------
He tore his gaze from the console to look back at her. He gave a small smile to let her know that he was alright. **"My parents are good people. They loved me, cared and provided for me. Taught me right from wrong. They may not have always understood me but they loved me just the same. They were also over protective and always thinking that they knew what best for me too. I miss them terribly."** He gave a soft halfhearted chuckle. **"I haven't thought about it since I left. I guess I can see what they were thinking."** He looked away from Tar'ja out the canopy. The display outside of the ship traveling through hyperspace was beautiful. **"You see they didn't want me to leave with that 'old fool Garet'. They wanted me to stay there on Corellia where it was safe. I couldn't. Once Garet opened my eyes to the possibilities I knew I no longer belonged there. I would have become a danger to them and my siblings if I had stayed. My affinity to the Force was growing stronger and it would only be a matter of time till I was discovered by the Empire."**
He looked back to her pale blue eyes. **"My parents may not have been perfect but they cared."** He gave her a smiled that didn't sustain itself. He was holding something back. When he thought about Garet and her question if he ever beat him made the smile comeback. **"Master Garet was completely different."** As he thought about his master his mood changed for the better as he recalled the times spent with the wizened Jedi Master. **"Yes he was kind, and strict. Ruthless…"** He cocked his head to the side. **"No not really. And he never beat be if I did something wrong or messed something up. Which was common at first. A mistake was a lesson learned. A lesson learned was something to build upon so it didn't happen again. He pushed me hard. Pushed me to be better and to be mindful of the Force. He was a good teacher and an even better friend. Almost like a father. He gave his life so that I could escape the bounty hunters that had tracked us down."**
He shrugged his shoulders as he gripped her hand seemingly for support. **"Someday I'll see my parents again. Maybe when the Empire is gone and I'm a Jedi Knight. Maybe then they will see I did the right thing. I'm supposed to be here. Not there."** The last was said with conviction.
OOC: This is a continuation of the RP that Zerah and I are doing. I'll add to Tru's post from this evening later. And as far as having an rp(blue book) section for times like this, when the game moves on but there's still some rp to be done, it can be done there and not clutter up the game thread that is moving forward. I'm all for it as it was my suggestion. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Kasga's alarm woke him up on schedule. He hit the galley and made some food for himself. Moving to the system console, he reviewed the data on the system they were bound for. Heading to the cockpit, he took over pilot duties as they leave hyperspace. The system is pretty bare of technology, though there is a landing beacon. Kasga follows it's guidance and puts the ship down just outside of Betwixt Station.
The planet looks pretty barren. Kasga goes and finds Naryen. **"Ma'am, we've landed. I'm going to go check our landing struts."**
Kasga arranges a cloth across his mouth and lowers the ramp. He steps out of the ships and checks the supports beneath the landing struts. One of them straddles a pothole, but Kasga's pretty sure it will support the ship. Heading back to the foot of the ramp, Kasga looks around grimly while waiting for the others.

After a brief discourse with Dexter about their mission, and a small amount of background Naryen thinks she already knew, she spends the rest of their short trip reviewing the provided information. Looking for any obvious sign of misinfo, she found none.
Soon they arrive at another dust-hole.
***Frak, I see a dust-devil!*** Naryen wears an eye-pout as she looks out from the bridge portal. She nods to Kasga as he departs to tend to pilot duties. Naryen returns to the bunk-room and gears-up to disembark. ***"With steely resolve the Imperial officer prepares to disembark to perform her duties critical to the survival of the Empire and it's citizens."*** She smiles at the familiar bitter aftertaste her internal sarcasm now leaves behind.

**Besbooaan System. Planet side**
When the *Last Hope* touched down Chase stood up from his seat as Kasga began running through the shutdown procedures. **"I'll grab my gear and get ready."** with a quick glance to Tar'ja, giving her a wink, he turned and made his way to the bunk area following Nayren who left just seconds before. Like normal things were quiet between them. Sooner or later things would have to be discussed. He had hoped that it would have happened on the trip here but it didn't Given the fact that much of his time was spent with Tar'ja probably didn't help either.
Walking up to his bunk he grabbed his weapons belt and put it on. His light saber was still attached to it where it swung freely. Removing it he held it in his hand as he looked it over. Satisfied with its condition he returned to weapon to the concealed holster where he generally kept it when out. Besides it also kept it out of sight from Nayren, which right now, wasn't a bad thing.
Turning from his bunk he gave her a nod as he moved for the rooms exit and headed to the ramp that had already been lowered. Walking down the ramp he looked around at he immediate surroundings. There wasn't much to look at. **"Great there's no way we could possibly stand out here."** He said with some sarcasm to Kasga. **"There is one good way to look at this though. Being so remote they may not have heard or seen any reports about Nayren and Tar'ja."**

**Besbooaan system - Outside Betwixt Station**
Kasga closes some of the external flaps to keep the dust out. Why can't we land some temperate paradise just once in a while?
At Chase's comments. Kasga grunts, "Hmmmph, maybe. I'm not sure I'd count on that though. Lots of enterprising folk might try make some cred selling eyewitness accounts of troublemaker to anyone who would pay."
His brow furrows, "I don't recall any particular security troubles in the first report on Besbooaan. You think we need more firepower than just our pistols?

Chase smiled at Kasga's comment about troublemakers as he continued to look around. Bringing his gaze back to the Duros he nodded. **"Well, we'll just have to make sure we don't cause any trouble here."** At the mention of heavier weapons he shook his head. **"Good question. It cant hurt but may draw more suspicion. Ever try getting information for someone while holding a rifle? It doesn't put them at ease. I have my lightsaber on me but I wouldn't used that unless it was a last resort."**

(In the ships common room before it landed.)
Dexter pours his caff and take a seat in the common room. Sipping from it slowly, his mind running through what the information was that would be release to him and the other in time and why his friend the top of his class was captured. He turns to Naryen. "The information is time coded so I have little knowledge of what is there, other then my contacts want her found." He takes another sip of his caff. "The thing that gets me is how she was captured at all. She was the top of our class, one of the best. She wouldn't make mistakes that would get her into trouble, so what happened?" Dexter keeps trying to work it out in his head. The only way is either she fouled up the mission, or some one betrayed her. Either way this mission would most likely be a trap for them as well.
Dexter waves aside the concern for his older friend and focuses on his new one. "So Naryen. How are you doing my dear? You seem different, like a weight had been lifted from your shoulders. I take it everything went well with the good Captain back at the station?" Dexter didn't mind talking shop as it where with others. He just had dewelled on it for sometime now, and he needed to shelve it for the time being.
(After the ship had landed.)
Dexter walks to cockpit after cleaning up and talking with Naryen. He had to admit he liked her. She was different from others he had met in his travels. He looks out the windows of the craft at the barren land scape of the planet. Shaking his head. "It's official. The galaxy hates me." He settles into the comm station and checks things over. Maybe there would be some comm traffic he could glean something from other then the normal buoys and the like. "Next mission we go some where nice. Where people are less likely to shot us and rob our corpses." The planet itself was Imperial controlled but they surely didn't bother with a garrison for this place. If they did the troopers here would most likely be easily paid off or persuaded to look the other way. If his friend was truly still held here it was going to be hard to get to where it was and find it. As the ship landed he moved to help Kasaga secure the ship and grab his gear. He puts on his gun belt and hiding his hold out just encase it was needed. Then he heads back to the engine area to check over the hyper drive and make sure the other systems where functioning normal. After the checks he heads down the ramp where Chase and Kasaga are talking. "So how do you want to play this? We going to pose as traders or are we just passing through looking for work?" Dexter hoped that Chase had a plan for there cover. It was important that there stories matched so if captured they had something to tell there captors. Most normal people around town would care about anything other then get the credits that they had to spend.

Tar'ja glanced up as Kasga entered the cockpit for taking over the controls. With Chase trying to move she figured it was time to get up and get ready. Standing to let him out she follows on his heels with a faint smirk on her lips, rather pleased with their conversation earlier.
In the bunks she grabs her belt and checks her blaster, Chase had left his cloak something she eyed now with a hum. It was longer than her own cloak, and would certainly hide her coloring. Shrugging she grabs it and dons it, setting the hood over her head to shade her face, pulling the ends together for added protection.
Moving up behind the other two she frowns, great. dust ball. She was going to be so hot in this thing and again have sand in bad places...then again...maybe she'd utilize that for some good bonding time. A slow wicked smirk works over her features, hidden by the hood as she thinks it over.

Hearing a noise at the top of the ramp Chase turned his head as blue eyes looked up the ramp only to see Dexter followed by Tar'ja coming down the ramp to where he and Kasga stood. He nodded as he saw that Tar'ja, like before, had put on his robes to cover her skin coloring. The hood was pulled low to hide her face. Even he couldn't see it. When they reached the bottom Chase looked at her. **"Good idea to cover up your coloring."** He gave a slight chuckle. **"Your going to be roasting in no time."** He teased her.
Dex was quick to get to business asking how they wanted to play out why they were here. The Bothan was right as they would all need to be on the same page as to why they were here. He looked at the other three who were here and shrugged. **"Either would work but both might take on some scrutiny. There isn't much to trade here nor is there much for work. That much was covered on the data pad that Tomas gave us remember."** Looking back up the ramp he wondered what was taking Nayren so long. **"Nayren may have thoughts on this also. But what about you? Spying and subterfuge is supposed to be your specialty."**

Listening to Chase's input on what Dex had asked. He was right this was Dexter's area and he would have to come up with something. "Well the passing through part may work. Even for this back water that can't be to far out of the ordinary." Dexter put a little more thought into the idea. "Well sense this is a pretty much out of the way place we could go with a smuggler cover. It should work." Dex looks at the others. "Well what do you think?"

Looking around, Kasga comments, **"The smuggler cover might be a good idea. The Lords of Atron know a legal trader isn't going to find much in the way of foodstuffs to export from here. It also might connect us with a criminal subculture that may help us find Captain Runn's agent."**

Dex looks over a Kasaga. "So I guess we go with the smuggler cover." Dex smiles at his friend. he may have had a more interesting life then he had once thought. "The in with the criminal element here maybe helpful as well. I would caution against pressing our luck with them though. The time I did it almost cost me and some one else's lives. Luckily that air battle broke out over head that day, or you would be without my charming company." Dexter laughs a little at hat had happened that day. "Well I suppose I will check the computers for that info that was dumped into the ship computer core and check on Naryen." With that Dex turns and walks back up the boarding ramp into the ship to start finding the data they needed.

When the ship landed it s engines created a small cloud of dust around the ship. As the landing ramp opens the smell assaults your senses. It must be close to growing season, the smell of nerf manure is everywhere. A small breeze blows dust onto the ramp and a dead stringy plant tumbles into one of the landing ramp struts.
In the distance you hear the sound of speeder engines. You are unsure of the number but you can tell there is more then one. You also hear the odd blaster shoot in the distance. In front of you rests the town buildings, all weather worn in a semi circle around the only building with a communications array. None of the buildings have signs and a few look completely abandoned.
Surrounding the town are small rolling hills covered in short tough vegetation. Nothing larger then a bush grows in this area. Roaming the hills to all sides are small herds of nerf. Nerfs are quadruped herbivores none for their four curved horns, shaggy coats of fur and smell. Among one of the small herds is a lone man dressed simply and wielding a long stick to direct the herd over the hill. The man stops to look at your ship then continues on.
Outside the towns cantina the lone man still sleeps undisturbed by the landing of the Last Hope. The sound of music can be heard from inside though the music seems to be running slower then normal as if the computer playing the music is defective. The few windows on the cantina are coated in dust concealing the inside.

**"The station debrief was … cathartic, yes."** Naryen paused as she considered the experience, looking down at her own drink. A simple and warmed fruit concoction similar to what she had on Tatooine. She never had a taste for them before but now... ***What else will change?*** She frowned a little in contemplation of some of the choices she had seen others make, good and spectacularly short sighted. **"If you say caution then that is our move.

Naryen checks her eyes for any of the added character she got on Tatooine. Once she is satisfied that her attire looks sufficiently civilian and sensible she moves to the cockpit. Over hearing the end of an exchange about presenting themselves as smugglers, ***I thought that that was not something one advertised. "Couriers of reputation" then?*** she moves to the ramp where she heard the conversation and asks to the group in general. **"Doesn't seem very big. Will some stay as back-up?

As they talked outside the smell of the place finally got to him. Paring that with the almost barren that was trying to be helped with Nerf poodoo and the lack of populace, Besbooaan Was turning out to be a real treat.
**"I think this place will be worse than Tatooine."** His face was scrunched up as Chase made the comment.
At Nayrens comment of leaving someone behind Chase looked to the town and surrounding countryside. **"There isn't much here. Think there's really a need to leave one behind? Locking the ship down should be fine wouldn't it?"** He placed a hand against the support strut of the ramp and leaned against it. He didn't thing leaving a person behind was necessary but if the rest thought it prudent then he'd go with it.

Tar'ja listened quietly, there was little she could add here as she was covered from head to toe to just make sure no one would see her coloring. Maybe says she had a pigment disease or something...
At Naryen's suggestion she hums faintly "it is an interesting idea, yes this place seems small enough to allow us all to go and simply lock the ship, however, it is for that same reason having someone at the ship may also be a good idea for a quick getaway or for cover fire." she looks over them all "what do you think? what would be best here?"
She frowns "we may all be needed for this mission too.."

Kasga glances over at Dexter, a plan forming. **"Ma'am, we might be able to make it more difficult to steal. If we removed the primary power conduit connectors between the reactor and the engines, anyone who steals it can't take off…Of course, neither can we until we fix it. I'm sure Dex can do similar things to the ship's computer. It might cause us trouble if we have to take off in a hurry."**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2010-11-14 23:16:02)

Chase nodded at Kasga's idea. **"Makes sense. He could just enter a lockout on the control systems requiring a sequence of numbers to get things going again. It would only take a matter of seconds to enter the code."**
He hooked a hand on his belt and looked back to town. A gust of wind picked up and began whipping the sand around. ***Didn't we just leave a place that was pretty close to this?*** He looked back to Nayren. **"With either a lockout code on the ships computer or the entry code on the boarding ramp the ship will be safe enough. Have both in place and we're even better. Besides it's not like we wouldn't be able to see someone poking around it."** He looked back to the cantina. **"Besides do any of us want to stay behind? There isn't much here but its better than staying the the *Last Hope* like we have been for the last two days."**
He looked at the three that were outside with him. **"Start with the cantina?"** He raised his eyebrows as he asked the question taking a side step in that direction.

(Back inside the ship.)
Dexter moves to the main computer conceal on the ship and starts to work trying to find the information that was dumped in the core when he was mining for information on his friend that was captured. "Well my friend lets see how good you really are ." He says to no one but himself and the person that buried the info dump. He begins searching the computer. This would also be a good time to check and make sure no one had messed with anything else. Slicers sometimes left little gifts behind that had a way of bitting one in the back side when it was least conviviant . His hands move over the controls working his special magic on them. He had not found a system yet that he could not slice, but there was always a first time for everything.

Dexter easily enters a code into the ships computer which he then shares with the rest of the group. The ships computer system is not very complicated and most ships in the galaxy have similar codes to prevent such theft. At Chases suggestion Dexter also adds a lockout code to the ramp, this code is also shared to the group.
Dexter also takes a quick look around the Last Hopes computer system. After a few moments the Bothan is satisfied that both the message had deleted from the computer as it posted and there was no sign of tampering into the ships systems.
With your group ready and standing on the ships ramp you view the little rural town. Having just about enough of the local aroma Chase takes the lead and heads for the cantina.
As the human jedi approaches the cantina the sound of music can still be heard, as well as the low snore of the local sleeping against the cantina wall. A wide brimmed hat provides the local with both protection from the sun and some amount of concealment to his face. Inside little outside light enters shadows play across the entire room.
To one side of the room a window in the wall serves as the cantina bar. A Thin Zeltron serves drinks to the cantinas only waitress a young human girl wearing a simple brown dress. Above the window a blue neon sign blinks "Nerfburgers"
The cantina has few patrons all of whom generally keep to themselves nursing a dark liquid most likely a local alcoholic beverage. The single room cantina has several empty wooden tables. No one in the cantina even looks ups as your group opens the cantina door.

Tar'ja follows, pausing in interest to the off little being beneath the hat; quite fascinating to see it..him? lay in the sun for a sleep? odd. She looks over to the rest of the group, rechecking her hood that it;s covering her face and moves her hands to the sleeves to cover them better.
The cantina was....small. Seemed no one really cared to view new people entering or leave their town, a good thing for them but "where to start?" she asks softly to her comrades.

Walking to the cantina Chase could feel the red, almost sand like, dirt give way beneath his boots. He sighed as he looked down at the ground. ***"Just like Tatooine this stuff is going to get eyerywhere.*** He thought remembering the time spent on desert planet. Out of the corner of he eye he saw the shadow of Tar'ja waking not far from him. Looking in her direction an idea had come to mind that caused the smile that came to his face be more mischievous than he intended.***Hmm being here could prove to have interesting ramifications.*** He gave a slight chuckle as he looked back ahead towards the cantina.
He gave the sleeping human a look as he walked up and past. He found it hard to believe that the man was able to sleep there but like anything get used to something and one can sleep anywhere. Taking a few more steps he pushed though the door into the single room cantina. It was unremarkable in most every sense save the Zeltron serving drinks who seemed out of place. Wit several empty tables before them they had ample places to sit. What was a bit odd was that no one even looked up to see who came in.
Beside him he heard Tar'ja speak softly wondering where to start. Looking around The young Jedi had no idea. **"We could always be direct and to the point."** He said speaking softly. Looking at her shorter frame that was hidden beneath his cloak he smiled. While it hid her coloring well it did little in hiding the lithe form that was underneath. **"Start with a table."** He said to them as he took several steps to an open table, one that was closest to a wall if it existed.

After locking up and making the ship secure. Dex follows the rest of his friends into settlement next to there landing area. He pulls his cloak around him to hide his weapon and use the hood to block out the sun. "Another charming dust ball of a planet. Must complain to my travel agent." Dexter had just gotten the sand and dust out of his fur and everything else and now he would have to deal with it again. He steps carefully around the sleeping person and into the cantina. The place was even more depressing as locals set at tables and drank there misery away. He says quietly to the others. "We always wide up in the most charming of places. We are truely blessed." Dex moves to open of the open tables and sets facing towards the door. He takes in the room and the people in it. Putting his training to work trying to see what he can glean from his surroundings.

He heads into the cantina and sits down with the others. He looks around the washed out bar. "Anyone got any ideas on where we should start looking for our missing person?"

Naryen speaks to Dexter before he gets to work **"Try to encode an encrypted comm burst alarm in case of unauthorized access."** she tries and fails to smile as a flurry of dust elicits a grimace from her features. **"We are investigating a possible besting of a classmate of yours, after all."**
She waits by the ramp while Dexter sets the ship then informs them of the new protocols. As they walk to the "town" she stares into the surrounding vista and considers stories of people that have a "feel" for places.

Chase smirked at Nayren's comment. **"As long as things stay quiet I think that can be arranged Deidra."** He used her alternate name that she had used on Tatooine since her real name might be too memorable.
He sat back in his chair only to lean again when Nayren had asked what the Bothan's cover was. To be honest he didn't remember hearing it mentioned but he had an idea that would work with Nayren's suggestion about letting them come to us. he spoke so that only those at the table could hear him. **"We can always say that we're friends of hers and that she had let us in on some work she wanted done. If that doesn't get the attention of someone I don't know what will."**
He waited for any response to his idea before waving the young serving girl over. The longer they just sat here and did nothing the the more suspicion they would draw. Though to be honest that might not be a bad thing.

Dexter leans over towards Nayren and says quietly. "One was selling feed of some sort I think. The other was security sales. Which one she used I do not know." Dexter knew that if Empire was holding her the place would be secure. Unless of course they under estimated her abilities then they where in for a world of surprises. The options that his friends had come up with where interesting and would cut to the point. Looking around at his friends. "What is the one person in this building that would see or hear about all that is going on in the settlement?" Dex of course already knew the answer but wonder if any of them did. Unfortunately this would involve Dex sticking his neck out and hopping his friend would save him before the ax fell.

Tar'ja moved silently to the table following after the others to take a seat. With their talk of cover stories and how to make themselves more of a spectacle with which to draw the attention they needed, she wondered if it would have been even more useful to just sit there.
Folding her hands within the large sleeves and leaning back into her chair, one leg crossed over the other, she was beginning to wonder if she should go off and sit alone at a table. Hooded figure that orders nothing and simply appears to be watching would draw attention...perhaps easier than what they were discussing.
"Why not simply sit." she says softly, "they didn't even look up when we entered, there's no definite way something will bring attention to us, so why not try a few."

Sitting up close to the table, so he could hear the others, he looked around and made no attempt to hide it. He liked Tar'ja's and Kasga's ideas on trying a few different things. If one didn't work another may. He shook his head in disbelief when the answer Dexter gave to Nayren's question was even close to what had been asked. When he asked his question his gaze shifted back and forth between the other three.
He finally gave up holding back and looked at the Bothan. **I see two in here that would qualify for that. First the bartender and second the waitress. Both are going to hear all sort of things that are said here in this establishment weather it pertains to the amount of sand that has made its way into their clothing or something more illegal. Actually with that in mind if we want someone to overhear like Deidra said."** He let his last word trail off. He had that look about him that said he was committed to his next action.
He looked to where the serving girl was and waved her over. It took a moment as she was just delivering two drinks to a couple of patrons sitting on the opposite side of the small cantina. When she stepped up next to the young Jedi, Chase had a good look at her and realized that she was indeed young. He spoke up loud enough for others to her with out being obvious about it. **"Perhaps you can help us? We're looking for an acquaintance of ours. A female Bothan. We thought this might be the best place to ask about her whereabouts. Can you help us?"** As he spoke he tapped into the Force and sent feelings of trust and friendliness out to the young woman.

As he reached out for a sense of emotion he was surprises to feel it come from Nayren. Not so much surprise as it was expected but while he had expected anger he thought he felt a bit of excitement. ***Interesting*** He thought to himself as the former Imperial played along with him saying that they were owed credits and took on a disgruntled look. He saw the look on her face and got the point.
He gave her a curt nod as he turned back to the young woman and gave her his best smile. **"Like my friend said we're owed cred. And lets just say that it's enough to make us come all this way.

Tar'ja decided to may have been more prudent of her to cross her arms, back rail straight; let them think she was the silent guard or the one with the guns....probably not a bad assessment there.
Her hooded head was still though her gaze crossed her sister in arms, strange of the redness, was she coming down with something? or was she angered again at the Jedi's useful mind? hard to tell with her sometimes. Turning her gaze and head to the woman, she allows a narrowed gaze of pale blue to stare hidden among the darkness of the hood with a look that nearly screamed 'I want my creds'

Your group finds a table at the corner of the room. Benches form half the seating in an L shape against the corner wall, while short wooden stools serve as the remaining seats. None of the common luxuries are found at this table no games vid port or music of any kind, this cantina is as rustic as it gets.
The cantina floor has a grit to it, and the walls looks fairly dusty. The locals inside have much in common with their surroundings. At the far end of the cantina the music continues to play on a continuous loop.
Dexter is one of the first to take a seat. The Bothan scans over the individuals inside. Everyone inside is attempting to mind there own business and at first glance one would think that the locals have not even noticed your groups arrival, but they would be wrong. The bar keep and waitress have obviously noticed your groups entrance, the waitress moving closer to the table you have chosen in case of an order. The locals too have stolen glances your way, sizing your group up and trying to determine your intentions.
At Chases question the waitress perks up, then stops with a confused look on her face. "Can I take your ord ..... whats a Bo tan?"
You can tell that this world sees little in the way of travelers. Being an imperial world it might not even see many non-humans as well. Dexter notes that more then a few have taking special notice of the three non-humans in your group.
One of the locals stands. An older man with a full white beard and hair. The man looks as though he may have been strong in his youth but his age has found him pot bellied and out of shape. His clothing is bulky of which his cloak covers most of his frame. The man lets out a low chuckle. "He said Bothan Sana not Botan. Like the fury one at the table a Bothan."
The young waitress turns a shade of red then begins to walk away. "Oh ... well sorry then. Let me know when you are ready ... to order that is." The girl retreats back to the bar.
"Don`t mind her we don`t see many ... visitors here in these parts. You boys lost or something?" The old timer moves a few steps closer both hands clearly visible with a slight smile on his face.

Dexter is surprised that Chase would just barrage in head first, but sometimes the direct approach work as it had some what. Dexter takes note of the locals taking interest in them. This may have just been cause traveler where few and far between or maybe something else. He also couldn't believe that Naryen would add what she added. There must be some troubles between her and Chase. Whatever it was he hoped they would work it out and not let it interfere with the mission, he would have to keep an eye on Naryen help her keep this in check. Looking up at the man standing talking to them. "You could say that. We are looking for a friend. A Bothan female. She was to meet us here but we are running late. Engine troubles. Have you seen her by chance?" Dexter stays seated. The table would give him some cover. With his friends here he doubted that the locals would cause trouble. Looking over at the waitress. "Ales for me and my friends." Dexter smiles at her. She was a nice girl who just had a rough life on this backwater.

Chase was seated against the wall near the end of the table. From this vantage point he would be able to stand up quickly and act if the situation called for it. Seeing now that some of the other patrons have taken notice of their group the young Jedi hopes that this time around such actions would not be needed. Watching the young waitress he sees the look of confusion wash over her face.
Stealing a quick look to the others with a raised eyebrow. Noticing one of the patrons standing he shifted a bit making it so that he could easily reach his blaster if things went sour. Looking at the man its easily seen that the gentleman is older and out of shape as he walks towards the table. Correcting the young girl attempt at saying Dexters race he moves a bit closer as the girl move off.
"Don`t mind her we don`t see many ... visitors here in these parts. You boys lost or something?" The mans gruff voice matches his wild hair and full beard. Noticing the mans smile and posture, especially how the man keeps his hands visible to them, tells him that the man may have been seen a thing or two in his younger years.
To his left Dexter began applying his trade. This time Chase hoped the Bothan's mind stayed on topic and didn't forget anything. Looking at Nayren and Tar'ja as he took a relaxing breath and reached out with the force taking in his surroundings.

Tar'ja looks up to the girl, sending a glare to the bothan as he thought to order drinks for the table without much care of what others may like. she speaks up with a rough "whiskey." Hooded head unmoving as she continued to stare in the direction of the girl and now the approaching male.
"Don`t mind her we don`t see many ... visitors here in these parts. You boys lost or something?" She would have scoffed at the idea of him thinking that she was male, even with the cloak, but better him to believe that then what she was...or who.
She had to appreciate that he kept his hand where they could see them, a good measure on his part to show and bring out some trust in conversation. She stays silent though, she didn't want to give away she wasn't a 'boy' as he seemed to think....granted she did wonder what Naryen would say about that.

Kasga was bored with sitting around and waiting. Dexter heads off to work the room. Only when its mentioned does he recognize that they stand out. We are a motley crew.
The older man comes over and Kasga tenses hoping the man means them no ill. Dex begins to spin a story about the other Bothan. If the waitress has never seen a Bothan before, I bet she never came in here before. If aliens are rare in this system, her presence will be obvious. Her hiding spot will have to be very good to keep from being noticed. That could be a problem for us. Most commandos are survivalists. Most spies are urbanites. I think I need to quiz Dexter on her background. This is main urban area on the planet.
Kasga sighs and sits back to wait for something to do.

Naryen pays shows nods and smile to Dexters story until the friend part. She allows a little scowl to show that she doesn't quite agree with the word choice. This could be interpreted as annoyance to the idea that friends are late and owe money. ***Let them think that friend means "compatible" as two Bothans may be.*** a wry smile spreads across her face as she shows consideration to Dexters story.
She looks around the group to see if any seem to share her mind and when she only finds indifference or caution she returns her attention to the patron addressing them. ***His body language is conspicuously disarming.*** She looks around the room with slightly more hardened eyes to see if she can spot his back-up. ***It would be nice to not have a gun-fight in a bar for a change.***
Naryen appears impatient.

The grizzled older local eyes your group as you discuss the current topic of the Bothan friend. "Bothan friend you say, no you are the first Bothan I have talked to for a while now." You watch the man closely, in your training you are skilled at noticing involuntary facial twitches, and rapid eye movements when other lie. You see no such evidence in this man.
Chase opens himself to his surroundings letting his emotions free. At first Chase senses some fear from the locals, not directed in your direction but it is there. It could be simple worry and fear about the next harvest or the next meal you are not sure. Your concentration is wavered by the buzzing of the speeder bikes. Speeder bikes you had once heard in the distance but have moved closer since. Kasaga too hears the buzzing of the speeder engines coming closer.
The waitress gives a bow "whiskey, yes miss." Quickly the waitress returns with the drink, waiting only for the credits payment before slinking back. "Umm ... 2 credits please."
The old man continues. "No I would say we have not seen visitors for a few seasons at least. None that I know of anyway. I am a scrap scavenger so I come and go out of town. I could however offer my knowledge of the local area and beyond. I am one of the more ... traveled here." The other locals continue to nurse their drinks. At this point you all hear the buzzing of the speeder bikes as they enter town. You also hear three shoots fired by blasters outside.

Kasga had detached from the conversation when he heard the speeder bikes coming in. He wasn't worried, just a forlorn recollection about his time on Tantooine. Then he hears the blasters fire and his pistol appears in his hand. He looks around to the locals to see if they identify this as a threat or normal in town activity.

### **Yogi** (2010-12-08 10:18:40)

Chase relaxed a bit when he didn't feel anything out of the ordinary when he reached out with the Force to those in the small cantina. There was some fear present but it didn't seem to be directed at them. ***That's good at least.*** He thought as he began to extend his senses out past the confines of the walls. Just as he started to do so the sound of approaching speeders broke his concentration. Silently he cursed to himself. Something as small as that shouldn't have broke his concentration but he couldn't help that now.
Looking at the old man as he speaks he was surprised that he hadn't seen any visitors. From the looks of things any non-human species would stand out here like a sore thumb. The young Jedi simply nodded to the old man. **"Thank you. That may be something that we may need seeing we don't know our way around."** He stopped talking as the speeder bikes entered town accompanied by the buzzing that always follows them. He looked to the cantina's door as the report of three blaster shots were heard outside. Seeing the movement from Kasga he shifted his eyes to the Duros and wasn't too surprised that the pilot had his weapon in hand. ***He's been so jumpy with everything that has happened in the last several weeks I can understand it. But this can cause a problem.***
Looking at Kasga he leaned forward placing his left elbow on the table while leaving his right hand in his lap close to his weapons just in case. **"What are you doing?"** He said quickly. **"Put it away no one has drawn on or attacked you."** There was a slight look of irritation on his face. Even he knew that drawing a weapon while negotiating for information or services was bad form. He shifted his gaze to Tar'ja and then to Nayren with a raised eyebrow hoping that one of them would also speak up to their companions actions.

Tar'ja watched the girl from under the hood, eyes following her call it a bit of mistrust lately but she wanted to make sure she didn't put anything extra in her drink. As she returns, the Twi'lek slips a credit chip over towards the Jedi's hand near her own, she wasn't going to risk her hand being seen. Which might bring up the question of why she ordered anything then, well simple enough is that it shows a bit of relaxation in the establishment, willing to place some money into the coffers shows a bit of trust and willingness of the group to talk.
She heard the bikes, then the sounds of fire and frowns under the cover her of the hood; hoodlums? a gang? She glances around the other patrons for a better idea of what was going on. Was this a regular occurrence? or was it something more..
The jumpy duros pulled his blaster "Put it away." she says simply, tone keeping a neutral coldness, after all that was the part she'd chosen to play "No need for that. Yet." she adds as after thought. a faint dark chuckle leaving her lips, play the part...Naryen would pick up hers in a minute she was sure of it. The cast was laid out, the one that knew the information, the likely rookie or shell shocked, the other leader, the silent and mysterious guard, and their leader to it all. Play the parts, and get the information needed, they all just needed to work together if there came about a need to fight.

Chase and Tar'ja called him on the pistol. On a strange planet, more caution was warranted. Maybe I am just being too twitchy. He opened his mouth to protest. His last thought halted his exhalation. Instead, he just mumbled, **"Sorry"**, as he tucked it away.
Since he was not actively involved in the information search, he focused his attention on what was happening outside the cantina.

As the local man tells them that there has not been anyone to this planet in sometime Dexter is stratified that he is telling the truth. He was probably more worried about where his next meal was coming from or his business then the comings and going of strangers he didn't know. "Excellent. Thank you for showing us hospitality. You say you have traveled outside of this area of the planet. Is there anything that has changed or is different beyond this settlement? Anything you have notice that seemed out of place?" Dexter realized that most people didn't really pay attention to things unless they where new or different in some way. "Shall we discuss the local area more over drinks." Looking at the waitress."My dear could you get my new friend here another of whatever he is having." Dexter smiled at the young girl trying to be a pleasant as possible while getting the information he needed.
Dexter heard the speeder bikes getting closer and the sound of blaster fire. Swoop gangs where so rude in there ability to interrupt pleasant conversations. Kasga was jumpy, but Tar'ja settled him quickly. With all that had happened in there short time together Dex could not blame his friend for his actions. His own hand had moved to his blaster when he heard the first shot, but he stopped himself before drawing the weapon. He was wondering what all the camotion outside was about and he slowly made his way to the door to see what was going on outside.
((OCC: Gather information +15 and preception +9. Trying to get out any more info that the man might have about what is happening on the planet.

Looking around she sees Kasga showing his nerves. ***Easy there.*** watches as Chase actually calls him on it in front of a complete stranger. She frowns at Chase with disapproval then clears her expression.
Looking back in the direction of the speeders and blaster fire. ***If that comes this way…*** Naryen then looks to the man that decided to be the bar or towns spokesperson and raises an eyebrow. ***Friends or business associates?***
She watches for any hint from the man about ... anything, ***Your lead, again sir Jedi.*** and a little irritation.

None of the locals react to the blaster fire outside. One shakes his head, a few mummer to each other but overall the cantina is not in shock at the events outside. The sound of the speeder bikes zoom past the cantina then down the street without further blaster fire.
The old man pauses for a moment, when nothing else changes he watches your groups reactions. The old man smiles at Chases invitation "Don`t know your way around, that means business for me. I can help you get around, for a price. Lets say 25 credits a day, with a 25 credit retainer fee." The man looks at each of you waiting for a reaction. "Most folk round these parts only know the nearby area, I know that and most of the abandoned towns and cities further on. What do you say?"

Credits! I hope the commander has considered this problem. I had hoped to orient our team before heading back out. Everything happened so fast, I didn't even have time to requisition a toolkit before we left. Haja, I'm just glad I recharged my energy cells in the hanger while I was working on the X-wing. 
Kasga looks over at Naryen to see how she handles it.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2010-12-18 23:02:09)

Dexter looks over at the local man. "The price is not a problem." Dexter looks over at his friends to see if they are in agreement. "Is there any place besides this one that has people? Seems like a silly question, but our friend could have went there." Dexter was wondering if the speeder driving blaster shooting people outside where just blowing off steam or was something else. It was also nice to see that for once the locals weren't trying to rob them or shoot at them for some reason. Having blasters pointed at you was a sure sign you where in the wrong place. Most of the time.

Chase paid close attention to the events outside and inside simultaneously. As the speeders raced past the small cantina and the patrons paid the blaster shots no heed the young Jedi looked back at the old man as he offered them his services. Looking back to Kasga the Duros seemed to have calmed down some as he eyed Nayren. ***Interesting it seems that he always looks to her before initiating anything. Almost as if he needs an order. Alright then let see how she deals with it. Besides I'm tired of feeling her irritation every time I do something.*** He thought
He is brought crashing out of his thoughts as Dexter answers the man. The Jedi's eyes narrow as his posture stiffens as he looks to the so called spy with loose lips . He wanted to call the Bothan out on his choice of words right there and then but held his tongue. It had bothered him that he didn't even try to haggle with him as their supply of credits were in short supply but what really irritated him was the fact that he went further and announced that price wasn't a problem not only to the man but the whole cantina as well. Chase simply sat there and traded looks with Tar'ja and Nayren as he began a relaxing technique to calm himself. The two that knew him would easily see the irritation on his face as he slowly took a breath and began letting out his frustrations with Dexter.
He sat back in his chair resting his chin on his left fist as he let out a breath his features calm again as he regained control. His right hand rested on his right leg close to his blaster. Since Dexter had just made it look like that they were swimming in credits the situation just became more interesting. He kept himself open to the Force in case any who overheard Dexter's words decided to take matters into their own hands.

Tar'ja didn't even need to look to know the jedi was beyond irritated. She turned her hooded head to the bothan, reached around Naryen, grabbed her sleeve to cover her hand and promptly hit the bothan over the head "You know better than to speak before she has."
The twi'lek had had enough of the damned bothan and his mouth, he was lucky she hadn't killed him yet. Her hooded head turns to the elder "He has no thoughts on his place. He's new." she says with a faint shrug. "how much do you offer for your services, and where would the price get us." She asks, or...states..depends on how you view the statement. "And questions of prices and the like should be directed to our captain, and second." She turns a hidden glare on the bothan "Not others."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **galenbd** (2010-12-23 20:50:55)

Dexter tried to negotiate with the local. To Kasga's amusement, both Chase and Tar'ja got pissed at him for doing so. It seems he presumed a bit much. Interesting that Deirdra didn't stop him when he first started talking for the group, now everyone else is pissed at him. I'm sure he's used to operating on his own when running covert ops. She needs to take command here if she's going to.
Kasga sits waiting for his commander.

Naryen was surprised at the reactions from Tar'ja and Chase, in particular the Jedi that decided to speak for them then not. Tar'jas reaction was so swift and skillful it was as if it didn't happen at all, though she thinks that their poor bothan agent/negotiator would scarcely think so. Chases abandonment of Dexters initiative, and therefore of Dexter himself, simply couldn't go unanswered. With diplomatic tone and expression she addresses the local that approached them: **"We'll need to make some arrangements but I agree with our friend here,"** she nods to Dexter though her passionless eyes rest on Chase and his ... display. Her voice finishes with a a tone that is less diplomatic and more... Imperial **"it shouldn't be a problem."**
She returns her gaze to the gentlemen with a broad grin, **"Can we contact you?"** then with a distracted expression that transitions to an irritated scowl she looks out of the cateena, towards the weapons fire. **"I'm sorry, are the people here usually so free with their weapons?"**

When dexter easily waves away any notion of barter and confesses that price is not an option the old man smiles. A few locals also seem to be looking at your group now as well. Nothing is said or done, only the two closest tables have it patrons sizing up your group.
The old man gives a nod "Well then it is settled. My name is Solen by the way." Solen pauses and continues when no one seems to know the name. "When do you wish to depart?"
Chase opens his feelings to the force, through you do not need to know the ways of the force to realize that about half the cantina has taking an interest in your group now. Chase seems at least a little satisfied when he senses no hostility from the cantina patrons only curiosity.
Solen then watches the show of hushed drama between Tar`ja and Dexter. When Naryen confirms the deal Solen smiles again. " If you need some time in town before we go I will be here all day until you would like to depart. Just come back here when you are ready. I have a speeder out back large enough for your, team. When you are ready we will head out and I assure you no one knows these parts like I do." Solen stands proudly at his last statement of achievement. "As for the weapons fire ....."
Solens voice instantly drops as the sound of boots on wood with a distinct metallic clink nears the cantina door. The entire cantina seems to stop all at once. For a moment the new comer stands just outside the door before entering. A tall dark haired human male enters the cantina. Well kept and clean cut the man looks military, the imperial uniform he wears displays his status as an officer in the empire. Naryen notes his rank of LT.

Kasga sits while the commander works out details with the local. He settles himself in the chair trying to release the tension caused by the blaster fire outside. When the officer, steps through the door, it takes all of Kasga's willpower to not look toward the back exit.
Settling his gaze on his drink, he takes a small sip before risking a glance toward the officer who just walked in. He places his left hand upon the table so both are visible and unthreatening. His mind start developing contingency plans along the lines of flipping table for cover with his left hand while his right pulls his Travotti Service pistol or running through the maze of chairs for the back exit.

The hit on the head from Tar'ja was surprising but not completely unexpected. She had developed dislike of the Dex, and he excepted that and worked with it as best he could. He couldn't under why she won't let him do his job, but that was for another time. As Naryen finishes talking to the local about his services as a guide. Dexter quickly moves to the back of the group and plays his part of the lackey he was supposed to be.
All intention is turned to the man that has entered the cantiana. He his dressed the part of an Imperial Officer and more then likely was. Dexter takes more caution to appear lesser then the humans he is with he does not raises his head eyes looking more to the ground and tries to disappear into the back ground. He hated Imperials for what they had done to his parents and others of his race. It is something that Dex is not unexceptionably good at hiding but he will make an effort for the sake of his friends.

Tar'ja again folds her hands within the cloak, now that Deidra was taking control and the bothan had realized the game they were attempting to play things could go a bit smoother. Let her decide everything and deal with prices, she was likely better at it anyway.
Attention was robbed from the man before them to the imperial that entered. She didn't allow herself to lose her posture or to appear to diminish in anyway, she had a role she had to maintain...even if she did want to roll her eyes to the universe and ask 'really?' figures an imperial would find them. It just figured.
It seemed though it wasn't much of a surprise to the rest of the cantina by the way they all simply stopped; had this imperial come before? or maybe this was a first time visit and these people were outlaws...or hiding like they were. Idly she glanced to Deidra from the corner of her eye, while she was hidden for the most part from being recognized, the human wasn't. She wondered if the imperials knew each other. Her hidden hands move to her lap, one hand folding the sleeve of the robe over her blaster, just in case.

((( OOC - Was the weapons fire coming from the direction of the Last Hope? )))
Naryen watched Solens reactions with interest ***Who's coming? Do you know or expect them?*** An Imperial uniform was, for some reason she couldn't logically understand, unexpected. The feeling of belonging tugged at her as she related to the poise and polish this officer presented as he walked in. The revulsion that took hold was almost violent as she felt disgust in herself.
She turned away from the officer with a look of impending rage combined with vomit, though not enough to hide her features.
***Past clarity was gambit. Simplicity is duplicity.*** The thought flashed through her mind with a confusing sense of organization. Naryen found herself looking at her hands, oddly calm, like she suddenly didn't know what to do with herself now that she didn't want to run back to the Empire or shoot that officer where he stood.
Stymied from her confusing mood shift she looked to Solen with every bit the expression of an attentive patron.
Except her eyes.
They expressed a quiet resolve that she hoped would convey what she felt. ***Your move, we will follow your lead.***
Naryen waited with him as the mood of the Imperial officer, as it is always done, dictates the next move of everyone else. Her new-found clarity pointed out the roots of fear that that behavior comes from. She tucked that realization away for later examination.

With the sound of boots clicking outside the cantina seems to come to a complete halt. All the patrons including their new guide seems to wait for the Imperial officer to do something. What catches him off guard was the emotions from his friends. Feelings from anger to revulsion are spread across all of them. Not to mention the looks on their faces. Surprisingly Nayren, who he thought would have control over her expression didn't cover it up as well as he thought she would.
The young Jedi continued to sit there with his chin resting on his hand as he looked to the newcomer. Imperial officer or not they had a job to do. They knew that was an Imperial controlled planet and they all should have been prepared for that eventuality.
Seeing as everyone was holding their tongue Chase did the same. ***"Lets see what the Imperial does or doesn't do."*** Darting his eyes to Nayren he had another realization. Her face had been transmitted all over the galaxy as the traitor. If anyone was to recognize her it would be the Imp. He watched the man like everyone in the cantina was doing waiting to see or feel a moment of recognition from the officer.

The imperial LT stands looks around the room then nods to the cantina keep. A standard issue blaster rests on the side of his well kept if not dusty uniform. Naryen can not help but to think who this guy displeased to get such a horrible post in the hind end of space. For a moment the officer scans the room the settles on your group.
"Is that your space barge out there?" The officer stares directly at Dexter as if fascinated by the Bothan.
With his head bowed slightly to the floor Solen speaks first. "These are newcomers. They want to explore the ruins and spend a few credits in town."
Dexter tries to make himself less obvious but no matter what he does the officer continues to stare at him. Its all Dexter can do but stare at the floor not meeting eye contact.
Still looking at the Bothen the officer reply's "Very well then, though I would remind you of proper port procedure to report all landings to the port authority." The officer then turns on a heel and marches out the door. The cantina seems to breath a sigh of relief as the officer exits the building.
Everyone stays quite until the metallic clink of the officers boots disappears. "That was Lt Tash Molin, he is in command of the local .... deputies. They are more a bunch of thugs then actual law round these parts. Tash uses them to exact his anger as he feels fit. Best to stay clear of that one." Naryen does not recognize the Lt name, though not surprising with the empire forces numbering so high.

Kasga leans back in his chair. **"I think he just wanted to lay eyes on us. And he took a lot of interest in Dexter. I'd bet he knows where our friend is."**

Dexter was relived when the Imperial Officer had left. He didn't understand why he thought that Dex owned the ship but it was attention that he was trying to avoid. He relaxes letting out a long breath. "I think you might be right my friend." He looks at Kasaga. "That maybe why he singled me out. I will have to try to avoid him in the future." Dex was still nervous from the encounter. He took a long drink from his Ale to calm his nerves. He noticed his hand was closer to his blaster then he had thought. Looking around at his friends. "This could be a blessing or a curse to us. If his attention is focused on me he might not care about the rest of you, but if he focused on all of us then that makes things harder." Dexter looks around for a chair to sit down and calm himself. If that Imperial had his friend they needed to find her and fast, cause there was no telling what would happen to her in that mans care.

"Chase do you think he was focused on me or on us all?" Dexter was hoping that his friend would have some in site that he did not have.

When the Imperial Officer left chase not only heard the collective sigh of relief but he felt it through the Force. While the man seemed indifferent he did pay close attention to Dexter as he sat there at the table. So much so it began to make the young Jedi wonder if the officer had seen another Bothan around in the last few months.
Chase nodded when Kasga voiced the same feeling that he was having. He looked at Solen. **"Does that man have that effect on everyone in town.** He lowered ihs voice for those at the table and Solen. **"Is the garrison here that big to instill that much fear on the locals?**
He waited for an the mans answer as Nayren asked Solen and the Ruins he mentioned and the fact that Dexter ask him if he had felt any thing from the Imperial as he looked at Dexter.
Sitting up a bit placing both elbows on the table Chase looked at his fur covered friend. ***Well at least he didn't come right out and ask if I felt anything through the Force.*** He tilted his head to the side as he looked to the door. **"I think it was plain as day to everyone in this place as to who he was focused on. He barely looked at anyone else besides you."**
Chase took a breath and let it out slowly as he began cracking each knuckle on both hands. **"Staying in here isn't going to do us any good.** He looked at Nayren and then to Solen. **"Like my friend said you mentioned some ruins."**

Tar'ja didn't let her blaster go when the imperial entered; she couldn't be too careful, any hint of recognation from him to either Deidra or even a glimpse of herself and he was going down.
But no, his gaze didn't waver once from Dex. He left, and it took her a moment longer before she put the blaster away and relaxed a little, the others were right. He'd seen another bothan before, for sure. Which meant he knew more than anyone here at the moment. She frowns beneath the hood and leans into the woman at her side, speaking in a whisper "We should make time to see to the imperial.." If he'd seen a Bothan before, and was surprised to see another, than he either had one or he knew where one went.
She leans back into her seat after, looking to said bothan, her thoughts along the same lines as Chase; at least he didn't say anything about the force..he could get away with saying that he can read people maybe..
On to ruins it seemed. bah. With an Imp that knows something they want to look at old things.

Solen relaxes after Lt Tash Molin the local imperial presence. The old scavenger looks down to Naryen "No they do nit have much to do on this barren rock, except bulling locals and the odd traveler." Solen looks off at the door again but you can see in his eyes that the man`s thoughts are far past the door.
At Naryens mention of ruins Solen nods. "Yes ... this world was once a prosperous agricultural focal point. It supplied much of the galaxies worlds, and was far more populated then it is now. Though that was a long time ago. Now many of the old towns and cities sit abandoned and crumbling over time. A few like myself try to make a living off anything that might have been left behind when those who could afford to flee did so."
Chase can sense Dexters uneasiness with being singled out. The Bothan is obviously not use to the spot light and when the imperial looked at him it was as if some recognition. Chase shakes his head slightly, that imperial was hard to read except that which he wore so obviously. The jedi had heard stories of some who could train resistance to the force, though he had meet with only a few.
The grizzled Solen nods to Chase, "Few in these here parts can afford much in the way of luxuries. Weapons are not a necessity for nerf herding. So Tash deputizes a few locals and has all but the run of the place. Every once in a while a local gets brave, mostly through drink. Tash has little tolerance for such displays."
Solen starts for the door "If they are back, hopefully its for the night. I will bring my speeder around front. If we leave soon we should have little more doings with .... Tash."

The cantina`s mood returns to normal after the encounter with Tash. The few locals inside return to drinking their problems away, with one or two stealing glances at your group. Solen exits as he had said, the double doors swing back and forth allowing some light inside.
The eerie music returns though it had never left. The little waitress continues to refill drinks as the cantina owner moves to cleaning large metal mugs.

Dexter looks over at Naryen. "Ya, we can figure something out." Dexter was still trying to calm his nerves. He did what he was taught to help him coup, but it was not working the greatest. Looking at everyone. "So what the next move? I can head with Naryen to the ruins and the rest can check else where, or has someone else thought of something." Dexter was trying to be a team player even his training made him more of alone operater, but it was time for him to adapt to working with others.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **galenbd** (2011-02-10 12:16:41)

Naryen had the right idea. Kasga slid his chair back and stood up. As he paid for his drink, He commented to Dexter, **"Don't get any ideas about walking off on your own. That man can call upon enough locals to deal with us in smaller groups. Together, we might be too large for his limited logistics to handle."**
Kasga strides over to the door and waits for the others to finish up.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2011-02-14 11:46:43)

Dexter looks up at Kasga. "Who me? Do something crazy and unpredictable? Surely you jest." A smile plays across Dexter's lips. He knew that in the past he had done some stupid stuff, but to run out of this place by himself may cost him his life or worse. "Besides I will have Naryen with me I am sure she is more then capable of protecting me." Still smiling he knew there was safety in numbers, but if this Imperial want to get to Dex he could have the resources to do so. The promise of wealth and power was a great motivator.

Chase could feel the subtle changes in those around him as well as the other patrons when the Imperial Officer disappeared from sight. ***With that officer knowing we're here things just got tougher for us. He's got to be thinking that another Bothan showing up can't be a coincidence.*** He thought to himself as the others were talking. Splitting up wasn't the best idea but it would allow them to cover more ground.
Kasga stood and moved to the door as Dexter made light of the situation. The young Jedi's eyes narrowed as he stood and looked at Dex. **"I'm glad you can see some type of humor in this but you stand out here just as much if not more than I did back at the last cantina we were in."** He said in lowered tones not mentioning the reason as to why he stood out. The dying Gran and the smell of cauterized flesh was probably still in the back of all their minds. **"Watch your backs and listen to Deidra."** He used the alias she had established on Tatooine. Best to keep up the persona than to let things slip.
He tossed a few credits on the table in addition to the others for the cost of their drinks and whatever else was needed. **"Lets figure things out outside."** He looked at Tar'ja who was still keeping up the act of their "muscle". With a nod he followed Kasga to the door and outside.

Outside the cantina it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the light. The street is still barren of pedestrians except the sleeping soul resting outside. Down the street you can see a few of the local thugs standing outside the door of the communications building, while another spins donuts on his speeder bike.
In front of the cantina a flat bed speeder sits waiting with Solen waiting in the vehicles only seat. The speeder cart is more then large enough for your group and of basic design. One seat a small wind break and a large metal box just behind the drivers seat. The whole contraption rests on a flat bed of dura steel with underlying repulor jets. It looks .... home made.
Solen himself waits with a smile "Jump on boy`s ... and girls. We have a trek before us its a big planet." You notice Solen now carries an older blaster rifle, though much of its outer casing seems to be missing. Solen taps it with one hand "Its for security only, lots O nasty s out there scavengers, burrow rats, saber wolf packs, just to name a few."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2011-02-20 17:07:58)

Shielding his eyes from the sun Chase looked around now that they had exited the cantina. The street looked much the same as it had before except for the local thugs that roared by moments ago on their speeders. Keeping an eye on them he turned his head as Solen gave them the go ahead to climb up on the cart.
Looking over to Nayren he indicated the cart. **"Shall we all go or split up to look over the town a it. Maybe we can find out if there's anything else to know about the lay of the land so to speak."** With that he gave a slight nod of his head in the direction of the thugs. **"This way we can find out what else we can do or find here."** He relaxed his posture as he tucked his thumbs into the belt that held his blaster.

<strong>Onward bold adventurers!</strong>**.**
With an appreciative smile to Yogis use of her alias, she accompanies the rest of the group outside with a final glance around the bar to see if she notices anyone else shifting to leave.
As Naryens eyes adjust, with a squint, the sight she is greeted with does little to help their ache. She looks over Solens transport and feels, again, the distance from the Empire. ***Even in these harder times officers would never have to hazard something like this.*** Then the local color entered her perceptions and something occurs to her.
Her eyes harden as she looks to the trouble-makers that are apparently on Tashes' payroll. Turning, then, back to Solens ride she sighs and with a disappointed tone she expresses her feelings to the group about having been out-maneuvered, again, and climbs in. **"Tash probably left orders for them to make trouble with us to get a reaction out of Dexter. Splitting up could play right into that and we should avoid trouble this early."** Her expression and body language, as she sits down in their offered ride, is best summed up as a short profanity.

Chase listened as Nayren spoke her mind about splitting up and how that may play into the Imperials hands. Looking back down the street as the one thug was still spinning donuts in the street he found that he agreed with her. Splitting up the group right now might not be such a good idea.
Bringing his head back around he gave a nod of agreement to Nayren who was now settling into the cart. **"You're probably right and it will give us more time to hear about the town and locals."**
Looking at the others and then back into the cantina he moved to the side of the cart and hoisted himself up as he looked at Solen. **"Do the ones down the street tend to give you or the other locals much trouble. My friends and I would rather have some quiet time instead of dealing with local trouble."** He settled down and made himself comfortable as best he could and waited for the others to board.

Stepping out into the street, Kasga's focus is on the thugs hanging out in the street. He climbs up on the cart Solen has and finds a seat facing the crowd. Naryen steps up after him and confirms his advice to stick together. She'll make a good commander yet. If we can keep her alive long enough. 
Kasga turns his mind back to the group of thugs. Hand on his sidearm, he keeps his gaze loose waiting for a blaster to point his way.

### **zerah** (2011-02-23 13:14:15)

Tar'ja was still tense when the officer had left, though finally holstered her weapon in time for the others to make notes of leaving. Sighing she tosses a few credits to the table and stands, gathering the sleeves to hide her hands better and follows after the others.
She was the silent muscle in this, that's all her role was so far and she had no trouble with just listening for the moment, better to allow her eyes to look over the scene; thugs...sleeping soul...thugs...
Her gaze narrows on them, she'd love to teach them a lesson, but Naryen was probably right, they were likely on that officers payroll, and making trouble now would only play into whatever plans he has...it can wait.
Glad to not be splitting up she moves quickly into a seat beside the Jedi, sighing as she shifts the robe to better cover her. "Dex. Keep quiet for a while...we don't want unwanted attention..yet."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

Dexter walks out with the others trying to keep himself from getting noticed any more then he was. He pulls the hood of his cloak up over his eyes the sun still bothered him a little but he could adjust. Looking at Naryen. "Agreed. I would like to avoid trouble with the local garrison if I could." He looks around at the others. "I guess we are together for now." He climbs into the speeder taking a seat next to Naryen. He looks over at Tar'ja and her comment about being quite and not causing trouble. He slips back into the role that the Empire wanted him to be in. A servant. "Yes, ma'am. sorry to cause any trouble." It leaves a bad taste with Dex but if he looks the part of the lesser being the Imperials may leave him be.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

Despite the mention of saber wolves, burrow rats and …. More your crew jumps on board the make shift speeder. Solen waits for your group to be seated before hitting the accelerator. The make shift speeders engines groan in protest as it begins to move forward, slight vibrations can be felt throughout the cart.
Down the street the local “authorities” have taken notice of your sudden departure. The two at the door point in your direction, while the third riding the speeder stops his play to allow the others on board. They accelerate out of sight using a side street. Judging from the direction of the road you are on and the parallel side street the locals are using they should intercept your group before you exit town.
Solen looks back to Chase “Yea they are little more then hired goons. They provide muscle for Tash when he calls for it. The rest of the time they grow bored, and spend their days harassing locals into cantina brawls. Best to avoid them if we can, rather than spend the night in a cell.”
The cart rattles its way down the road past the various make shift living accommodations. You see little of the local population save the odd pulled curtain as your group makes its way out of town. At the very least the town’s folk seem to have little to no interest in your crew.
Towards the end of the street you can see the buildings open up to the surrounding fields of scrub brush and Nerf herds. A head you see the “authorities” speed into position at the end of the road. The two passengers step down from the bike while the driver stays on with the engine running. The pair of thugs each pulls out metallic rods about a meter in length, one raises a hand in your direction palm towards you indicating he wants you to stop.

When they started moving away after loading up. Chase looked again to the three local that were on the Imperial payroll. Seeing that they had now taken an interest that they were moving Chase motioned to the others to keep an eye out. As Solen was answering his question he saw the three speed up a side street that looked like it might be running parallel to them.
His hand fell to his blaster and made sure the weapon was clear in the holster as he looked back at Solen. **"That plan sounds all well and good but what if their plans don't run along the same lines of our thinking?"** As Solen continued to drive the cart Chase could only sit there and enjoy the ride. Well enjoy it as much as possible when it looked like trouble was going to try and find them.
Closing on the end of the street he almost thought they might make it out but the rumbling of the speeder bikes engine roared as it came into view blocking the street. Two men stepped down holding what might be weapons and a upraised hand for them to stop. **"Here we go again."** The young Jedi said to no one in particular.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

Tar'ja took notice of the thugs, and their sudden departure. Thoughts of getting out without incident didn't even cross her mind, no it just couldn't happen like that because they were just not that lucky right now.
Sighing, the hiding twi'lek checks her blaster and looks over to the others "We should be ready for trouble." she says. sure enough, the other speeder pulls up in front of them and two thugs issue them to stop. She leans over to the force user "aim for stunning? less trouble if don't try to kill them if it comes to that..may show up again later but less hassle with that imperial."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2011-02-28 13:10:12)

*"You know we can't win for losing somedays."*  Dexter thinks to himself after hearing Tar'ja warn of trouble. He reaches for his blaster checking it for readiness and setting it for stun. "We could try to be friendly and not go right to sticking a blaster in there face. But I bet it will not go that easily for us." Dex re-holsters his blaster and waits for the speeder to stop and local bullies to have there fun. Dexter also had a feeling that this had a lot to do with the fact that he was a Bothian and that meant that there was a good chance his friend was still alive and they wanted to use him as leverage or the Imperial they had met knew who and what Dex was and that was not good either. "I guess this means that we have come to the right place after all, if they are making this much of a fuss over our arivial." Dex looks over at Naryen. "Stay close my dear. I will protect you." He says with a smile.

Everyone knew they were being watched. It came as no surprise when the swoop gang set up their checkpoint toward the fringes of town. The only question was when the shooting would start. Kasga shook his head as he set his blaster to stun. They didn't even wait 'til we left town. I wonder if they'd go so far as to impound our ship while we're away. Kasga waited quietly for orders, or for the shooting to start.

Looking at the thugs, with weapons and seeming sense of authority, Naryen recalled Solens reason for being armed and recalls a bit of in formation from her early education on Varbrindi: ***The most dangerous animal of all. Human.***
She felt that defaulting to local experience was the best move. They didn't need to start this visit with a firefight. Nothing like live fire exercises to encourage morale in an Imperial post that's gotten slack.

The speeder bike rider sits with the engine running, possibly in case your group makes a break for it. All three are human and with the exception of a imperial badge pinned to their chest they all dress in similar fashion to the locals you had seen in the cantina. Dusty weather worn clothes of browns, grey and black. Solen stops the cart at the lead "authorities" raised hand. From here you can see the pair standing are wielding stun batons.
Before Solen can answer Naryen`s inquiry the lead "authority" figure speaks up. His voice cracks a little betraying his youth. "Umm .. stop there. You forgot to pay your landing fees, yea all of them eh." Behind him the other two thugs chuckle. you see the driver spits something black on the ground.
Solen looks back to Naryen and shrugs his shoulders. "I am little more then your guide here, plus until I get paid I can`t be paying their bribe."

Chase laid a reassuring hand on Kasga's shoulder as the Duros settled down. Raising a hand to the youth in a gesture to wait a moment Chase turned to look at Solen and spoke quietly so only he and those in the cart could hear. **"I take it this is common here."** It wasn't a question really more of a fact. **"Just what kind of trouble would we be looking at if we taught these "authority figures" a lesson? Or is it more prudent to just pay them? Because if they are looking for trouble they found a significant amount of it with us."**

<strong>&#8230;Oh, did he now?</strong>**.**
**"Umm .. stop there. You forgot to pay your landing fees, yea all of them eh."**
**…bribe."** ***Ah, that answers that, then.***
The crackling voice of a pimpled whelp grates Naryens nerves as the glint from badges formed after the Imperial emblem catches her eye.
She has seen much of beings using and mis-using symbols for their own gain, but this irks her. A life devoted to principles that that symbol represented, at least to her, and she was not alone. To have that devotion exploited by those in authority and have the symbol reduced to giving common bandits a sense of misplaced purpose...
Her expression blanks and complexion pales and she moved her hand off her pistol, where it seemed to have gone of it's own accord. She blanks the image of a smoldering hole, where that badge would have been, from her mind. ***Ignorant children, much as you were. That fate is better reserved for those that put them before you.*** she smiles with an odd sense of playful masochistic humor.
Kasga provides Naryen everything else she needs, as she's confident the adolescents heard her companions protest, and she acts.
With Kasga behind her she flicks him a "hold" gesture without changing the ready posture she had slipped into when their new antagonists showed their intentions. With voice pitched for Solen, and those on the transport, she speaks with a calm reassurance: **"The retainer is yours, after this, if you insist."**
Then, projected with a cold confidence, laced with irritated menace, her voice carries with the conditioned practice of an Imperial officer directing her squads.
**"Our fees have been paid in full. Your failing to be informed is none of our concern. Your interference with lawful business is an abuse of power. Let us pass or arrange for us to deliver a complaint personally to your superiors."**
Hearing the last part slip towards a tone usually reserved for ordering an execution she realizes how enraged she had become. A measured fraction of an instant to reset and she follows with a **"Now."** cleared of all extraneous emotion, and carrying every bit of authority her voice had before, it carries like the sound of a blaster shot.
***Resisting their supposed authority will be all the excuse the Tash needs to thump us. To make them seem incompetent, however…***
She successfully resists the urge to giggle aloud as she watches, fascinated, for their reaction. ***… either way, this won't be boring.***

Tar'ja's gaze narrowed from under her hood, her hand never leaving her blaster, if anything she leveled it just a bit more near her leg; make it easier to stand and fire if need be.
Docking fees indeed, did that imperial really think that they'd offer a bribe? had their act not told him enough that they wouldn't be scared off like small children? She glanced to her side to the Jedi then over to the duros and then Naryen, she had kept her cool, offered authority and command; she was born for this role of leadership of that the twi'lek had no doubt.
Her friend was strong, and smart. it made her smirk to hear her give orders to the would-be imperials and watched eagerly to see them quake in their boots..or offer up a reason to shoot.

At Kasga`s out burst the thugs all laugh "Ma`am! ... Ma`am!" they copy the duro`s in jest. "You take orders from the little lady do you?" The trio seem to get a laugh out of the leads comments.
While it is true funds where transferred during the landing procedure, it was all done by automation. It is possible something was missed, or that these three are shaking your group down for a little spending credits. The three watch as Chase calms Kasga down eyeing the Duro`s for any sign of further outburst.
As Naryen voice cuts the trios laughter the thugs stand motionless for a moment. Obviously not use to resistance. Their silence is broken by the bike rider when he pokes fun at the lead thug "Ha! She told you Seb." The other two continue to laugh but this time at their companion.
"Shut up Kath. Don`t make me beat you like last time." The lead stares into Naryens eyes, his cold glare looks right through the woman as if she was not even there. For a moment the former imperial could swear that the man was going to draw his pistol. But then Dexters voice breaks the stand off. Seb snaps to the Bothan "Hold your tongue hairy one, we have ways of dealing with your kind. We have done it before."
The human taps his stun baton on the edge of Solens cart, sparks streak across its surface where the weapon makes contact. "I see your leaving town then. There is a fee for that. 50 credits or you stay here and we confiscate your ... vehicle." Seb stands chest pushed out proudly at his threat, while he awaits your response.

Tar'ja's hooded head tilts to the side "way's of dealing with your kind..." she repeats softly to her companions "I do believe we may have found some answers early."
Shifting to sit a bit taller, moving her feet to allow her to stand if need be and clutching her blaster for readiness to fire she calls "Dealt with his kind before have you. Do Tell." Her tone was not so much mocking as it did hold a threat and some odd joy at the idea of said threat. Either tar'ja was a good actor, or she was really enjoying this. "At your leave...Ma'am." she states, let her tell them what to do.
She glances to the force user at her side, the two of them were supposed to be the muscle in this charade.

The Jedi's eyebrows shoot up at the leaders boast. He looked at Tar'ja as she spoke softly and offered a nod. He looked back at the leader who had advanced far enough to to touch his weapon against the corner of the cart. Tar'ja continued to talk in an effort to draw more out of the one. **"Yes tell us, how many does it take to gang up on an individual to make it a fair fight?"**
Standing up he let the young tough see the size of his possible opposition. The move would also allow him to act faster in getting off the cart to take the fight to Seb. **"So Seb tell me,"** He leveled a gaze at the man as he looked down from the cart. **"Have you ever had to deal with someone…who isn't scared of you?** He paused for a second before continuing. **"I'm thinking no."** The last words were said with a surprising level of certainty.

Now that the play's been made, Kasga's professional indignation drains away. Tar'ja and Chase back her perfectly, Kasga elects for mute anger even as his mind turns over the ramifications of these thugs admitting to knowing about another Bothan. Surely they don't get too many of those here. He turns back toward the threat with a cold, cold stare and a hand on his blaster.

Seb takes a step back when the jedi stands, his hand moves towards his blaster. "you .. you stay where you are. Don`t make me call in reinforcements."
"Yea you tell him Seb." Kath bolsters him friend from the speeder bike.
Solen puts a hand on Chases shoulder and whispers "Boy are you ready to take on all of Tash`s men? If not sometimes its best to pay."
Seb stands for a moment waiting for Chase to counter. One hand resting on the hilt of his blaster the other holding the stun baton. The man stands staring the jedi down waiting for his next move.

*"So she may still be here. Fool just told us what we needed. This fool is about the get burned down and he is still puffing out his chest."* Dex thinks to himself. "This one barks loud for an underling. I do not think he truly understands the situation at all." He looks at his friends who have gotten in the ruffians face. Looking down at the thug. "My friend, it is better not let sleeping Kath Hounds lay. Unless of course you want to get bitten." Dex realizes that these people are not used to others standing up to them. He had ran into there kind before on other places. Most of the time they folded easy.

<strong>&#8230;Oh, did he now?</strong>**.**
Naryens face cracks a tiny, satisfied, grin as her assault lays bare the veneer and the child underneath. ***Far better than I expected. Just smart enough to get it. His use of "we" reveals he actually thinks he's more than Tashs puppet and a shift from a landing fee to a leaving town fee proves his original demands were indeed without merit.*** Her smile fades as humor leaves her and she considers Seb and their predicament, just as much victims of Imperial oppression as a Tash himself. ***They've got no other way of seeing the universe. Blinded just as I once was.*** A swell of pity motivated her forward. ***Poor things.***
She makes to answer when Chase and Tar'ja seem to abandon their senses and send Naryen reeling. It takes nearly everything she has to keep her eyes from bulging from their sockets. ***What are you doing! I said Hold! They're the brats not us!***
Thankfully Solens more experienced hand and voice makes-up for her stunned hesitation. "Boy are you ready to take on all of Tash`s men? If not sometimes its best to pay." ***Listen to him. Please!*** Dexter speaks the voice of reason that Naryen can only hope helps Solens warning to take hold.
Pitched for the group: **"Agreed my hairy friend. Just desperate younglings."** She hopes the dual meaning there makes the point stick. Pitching for everyone **"I mis-spoke, my apologies, I thought you said landing fees, my mistake I'm sure. A fee for leaving town is entirely different.** she turns to Solen though keeps her voice the same **"I wasn't aware that it was customary to interfere with local business dealings to such and extent. Tsk tsk."** she shakes her head histrionically. **"I'm sorry Solen, the more I see about how this town works the less I'm inclined to recommend further business here."**
Naryen takes a gamble and decides flesh out her role further to the thugs. Turning to Dexter, making sure not to stand between Seb and her Bothan friend, she makes herself out as the subordinate professional as best she can. **"That's my recommendation *Sir*, I just don't see this place as a viable investment. Too unpredictable. If we must pay the fine to proceed, very well, but I recommend a further incentive for more information on their previous encounter with *your kind.* It would be worthwhile to know if you've got some business competition we should be concerned with."**

From off to his side the Jedi feels the surprise and anger at his actions that he stood up to the young man. Inwardly he cursed at her. ***Karking hell. What is it now Nayren? Can I do nothing right by you?*** He took a deep breath as he continued to look at Seb. Solens words reach him and he simply nods to their guide. Nayrens voice sounded out as she weaved together words in an attempt to difuse the situation even more. Despite his feelings towards the woman she certainly could talk. ***Must be a requirement to be an Imperial officer.***
At her mentioning the need to pay the new fee in order to continue with their business he simply nodded. Moving his hand slowly so as to not scare Seb any farther he reached into a pouch on his belt withrdawing some credits. He could feel the emotions radiating off Nayren. They was anger that was strong and focused on him once again. He shook his head not indicating if it was for Nayren or the fact that he was paying the extortion. Not taking his eyes off the man he made sure that he had the required amount before crumpling the note and tossed it at Seb. **"Here."** Slowly he sat down never taking his eyes from the man. The ball was now in his court. What he did with it was now up to him.

At Nayren's mention of the investors Dex's mind starts to work on how he could use this. "That is true my dear. The investors will be disappointed at the fact that there is much lawlessness here. I guess our Hutt client will have to invest his large amount of credits else where. I guess we will have to move else where, he will not be pleased at this news." Dex looks at Nayren and then shrugs his shoulders. "Now that we have paid the fee may we continue? Maybe this place may have some other resources to make this trip not a complete waste." People generally feared Hutts for what they could do to others real or imagined. He was hoping that this fool would figure that getting favor from such a being was better then harassing them.

Tar'ja was miffed, why tell them to back down? She and Chase were only trying to do what they had placed to be the role, the muscles. She glances under the hood to the woman than back to Chase, a faint tug given to his back to get him to sit back down.
She does her best to attempt relaxing, though she was still tense, blaster held tightly and watching the male beside them intently. Chase handed the money over and the twi'lek had to mentally shake her head, this was ridiculous, but at least they'd finally be on their way.

Seb snaps back at Dexter as the Bothan tries to gather more information from the thug. "Shut up alien I told you to ... SHUT UP!" Hand on his blaster Seb takes another step back. As Naryen tries a different diplomatic approach Seb smiles. "Now you are speaking our language."
Chase tosses the credits to the ground landing to the left of Seb`s boot. Seb smiles again nods to your group and says. "Enjoy your visit to Besbooaan."
Kath from the speeder bike motions with his hand for your group to continue on "move along now, move along." While the third watches your movements. Solen acelerates the craft and soon you are on our way out of town again. as you pass the trio Kath looks at Dexter and replies "perhaps your benefactor would come and visit himself."
Behind you as Seb reaches down to take the credits you can hear the trios laughter. As you exit town you can just make out the thugs entering the cantina. Solen raises his voice as the cart makes its way over the tundra hills. "That might buy us a night, or even a day if we are lucky. Tash`s men fall easily to credits, but they will be back and in greater numbers."
Solen moves the cart to make some distance between your group and town before slowing its pace. Rolling hills and dotted herds of nerf. Overhead a single dark scavenger flies circles as it seeks out its next meal. "So where to boys?"

### **Yogi** (2011-04-01 09:03:50)

Chase eyes the the one on the speeder bike and his companion as Solen speeds up the cart moving past them leaving Seb behind them in the dust. He had already regained his composure and silently berated himself for letting it slip. Yet the anger that he had felt coming form Nayren and even the lesser residue that he could still feel grated on him like a faulty cog in a machine. Sooner or later something was going to fail. He just hoped that the mission could be completed before that happened.
He looked over at Solen as their guide stated that the bribe may last a day possibly less. Silently he shook his head as he simply stared ahead as Solen once again spoke asking where to head to. He didn't turn around to look at the others he knew he could look at Nayren and keep his cool but he wasn't sure about her. Though her training would most likely allow her to keep it under wraps till later. He wondered what Tar'ja and the others were thinking about the whole encounter. He simply shook his head as he mulled over what Solen had said about Tash's and his men. At some point during this mission they were going to tangle with the Imperial and his men. Best to find out just how many there actually were. Looking at their driver he spoke ignoring the mans question on where to go. **"You mentioned dealing with all of Tash's men, just how many does he have and why do the people of the town put up with it? It's gotta be hard enough to just get by with out them extorting everyone all the time?"**

"You mentioned dealing with all of Tash's men, just how many does he have and why do the people of the town put up with it? It's gotta be hard enough to just get by with out them extorting everyone all the time?"
He was right, it didn't make her feel better or less tense. There had only been three of them back there, they outnumbered them and they turned tail. bah. She must have had reason, maybe wait and let them think we could be pushed over or something..
Tar'ja didn't think that likely but it was all that she had in her head, paying them off..that was just crap. She didn't agree, but she wasn't going to argue, they still had a viewpoint they had to keep hold of in front of the locals, and she wasn't going to ruin that.

Kasga tenses as Seb vents his anger at Dexter. Hmmm, a xenophobe. I wonder if we can use that?
Regardless, Naryen guides them successfully out of town without incident. Hearing Solen talk about more of them, Kasga thinks forward. Sooner or later, we will have to deal with a lot of these pseudo-civilians. That's going to make our job harder. We know they have our contact, the question is where. It's unlikely to be out in these wastes. I wonder if we could uncover more from the Imperial Computer system.
As they ride out, Kasga considers how to tell Naryen. Solen is too close just now. Perhaps I can get him away for a few minutes. Outwardly, Kasga looks relieved that the confrontation is over and settles down in the cart watchfully.

Once they are on their way, Naryens expression changes from friendly to introverted thoughtful.
**"I think we should get your retainer out of the way now. You are the only friendly face we've come across here and I want to keep you around."** Turning to Chase then Dexter, indicating they should take care of it, she then moves to the back of the cart to sit down.
**"I say we go to the ruins we we agreed. Perhaps we could discuss things in more detail there, in private"**
Sitting down she considers what just happened. Her culture was so diverse and warlike for so long, it was only through mutual cooperation and a real sense of diversity as the core of true value. That the Empire could be so actively undermining those efforts on a galactic scale... The implications were... immense.

In the distance you can see the port town you had just left. On the horizon a seemingly endless tundra range that eventually meets the sky at the extent of your vision. High overhead the dark avian scavenger circles your group.
Chase is the first to break the silence with his inquiry into Tash`s resources. "Well the people of this world are poor folk. Once a wealthy and important focal point of this sector of the galaxy, those times are long lost." Solen spits a wad of dark chewing paste on the ground. "The locals will take most any job that offers pay. Tash holds conscript orders from some imperial Admiral which allows him access to credits and the local work force as and when he sees fit."
Solens words make the towns folk seem desperate, judging by the living conditions and the current state of the planet this assessment makes sense. Solen looks to Tar`ja and winks. "I suppose he could muster every able bodied man and woman in town, though I have never heard tell of it."
The dark scavenger begins to take wider and wider circles overhead before you begin to lose sight of it. A soft breeze begins to blow through the rolling tundra. Off in the distance only spots of clouds can be seen.
Solen smiles at Naryens kind words. "Ruins ... yes we could go there. I was there just only a few days back, had to leave early as Tash had a patrol out that way. Not sure what spooked them but I rather not stick around with his men taking up target practice. Weird they would go so far out for that though." Solen hits the accelerator and the cart once again begins to move. Slowly at first the carts limited functions and weak engine pick up speed.
Solen turns and looks back to your group "get comfortable the trip will take a few hours."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2011-04-08 13:02:58)

As the cart moved along Chase simply sat. What Solen had said about Tash being able to conscript every able bodied person didn't bother him as much as it should have. Just because he had orders to do so doesn't mean that they would all comply. The young Jedi had a feeling that if the majority of the towns populace sided away from Tash and his loyal few the towns folk would outnumber the Imperial. Question was how could they facilitate that if they needed that to happen.
He looked up into the sky where the scavenger began circling farther away from them see that none of them were going to be dropping dead anytime soon. He traded glances with the others when Solen mentioned Tash's men being out by the ruins and how it seemed strange that they would be out so far for some simple target practice. Maybe there was something else out there they they wanted to keep hidden.
Remembering what Nayren had said about paying the retainer for Solen's services he reached into his pocket once again and withdrew 50 credits. He held out the offered money to the guide. **"Before we forget again Solen here's the retainer and a days fee for now. If the thugs ask just tell then we haven't paid you yet and to talk to us. There's no need for them to take what you have rightfully earned."** He paused for a moment before continuing and jerked a thumb behind him. **"Back when Seb was holding us up he said something to my friend. 'Hold your tongue hairy one, we have ways of dealing with your kind. We have done it before.' Do you know what he was talking about? The anti-alien sentiment seems pretty strong here. At least among Tash's men."**
Waiting for the mans answer he opened himself up to the Force hoping he could detect if the guide was telling the truth.

Tar'ja listened intently even as she took hold of her hood and kept it from flying back. This human...he was a bit unnerving..like he could see through the layers to what she was hiding. Strange Human...maybe he was related to Chase..
It was good to hear though that the people of the town would likely not raise up against them if Tash gave the order, she made a mental note that perhaps they aught to selflessly help the people with whatever they made need, things around the town that need doing maybe, anything to give them more reason to side with them instead of Tash. She'd make note of this later when she could take to her soul-sister in peace, and when they were alone enough for the...'debate' to come of her treatment of their companion.
She had thought her life had been bad...hell these people didn't look to have freedoms in their own homes, she wondered if Tash would even let them leave the planet if they wanted or if he'd tried to ground them if he didn't like them...
Disturbing thought, but there it was.
"Back when Seb was holding us up he said something to my friend. 'Hold your tongue hairy one, we have ways of dealing with your kind. We have done it before.' Do you know what he was talking about? The anti-alien sentiment seems pretty strong here. At least among Tash's men."
Tar'ja tilts her head faintly to catch the answer from their guide "Curious, what is the towns sentiments on aliens? didn't seem to be much uproar so far but was that politeness?" She knew that if it came to a firefight in the town against Tash, which going by their luck so far in towns was bound to happen eventually, the likely hood of being able to keep hidden would continue, better to know if they really hated aliens too or not....better to find out later if they kept up with the news too.

Dexter took his seat after the thugs had left. Credits had been there only reason for stopping them in the first place and they seemed to not like the idea of Hutts coming to the planet. Not that anyone did. The info that he had picked up from the encounter was that his friend had been here, and they knew what had happened to her. He would have to process this some more on there way to the ruins.
As they are riding along he hears Tar'ja ask how the feelings of the own are about non humans. As most of the had not really seen a lot of anyone outside of the locals, and they where mostly human from what Dex had seen it was doubtful that they really much cared. Survival was there main concern. "I wonder if it would not be wiser if we have to go back to town to do it under cover of night? Most liking it would be easier to slip past the not very highly trained sentries that the local gang employees." Dexter realized that Tar'ja and himself maybe the only ones that could sneak back in at anytime, but if they where to all go darkness would make it easier.

<strong>Desperate is as desperate does.</strong>**.**
Naryen stayed quiet, thoughtful as the others relaxed and started to discuss things more openly. She took the opportunity to listen and take in everyone there. Chases impatience for a fight had gone from irritating to downright dangerous in a pistol flash. Hopefully he keeps his head the next time. Her feeling of irritation with him simmered quietly. She watched him consider a aerial critter for a moment, then decided making him her mental focus when he had that look on his face was probably not a good idea just then.
She focussed, then, more on Solen when he mentioned how Tashs assets were paying more attention to the ruins. She nodded that going there was worth the risk, given that the were searching for someone that may be on the run from the local "law" enforcement. Partially an out-loud thought and part a response to Dexters comment: **"The ruins may be worth checking out, especially if they lately came to Tashs interest."**
Naryen sat quietly and observed the world around her and the people in it and brooded more on the behavior of the Empire from her new point of view and listened to her companions for more opportunities for discourse. She bitterly considered that this would likely be the last time they'd have a moment like this while they were on this rock.
She imagined getting the information together, moving on it, then making like banthas on fire out of the system. Her tension elevates a little.

Kasga had settled back to wait until they arrived at the ruins. Dexter presented a plan to slid into town under cover of night. Interesting.
**"You know Tash is going to get more suspicious if we do that. I'm all for it myself, but we might come under more scrutiny. I'm not sure we have enough credits to cover that cost. "**
Kasga scans the dunes again looking for threats to their insignificant cart. I sure wish I'd brought the rifle.

Solen takes the credits and pockets them. "Thanks." Chase focuses on the grizzled man while he asks the question, reaching out with his feelings. "Not sure exactly ... some time back a few days time or so a line of fire lite the night sky. Tash and his merry band have been making treks out into the wastes searching for something." Chase searches his own feelings as he reaches out to the man, the jedi senses no deception in Solens words.
Solen turns to avoid a large boulder, "Town ruins, its no matter. If you could make up your minds we would be on our way." Solen rubs his chin in thought. "Ruins first you have to see the town again to leave. Plus I might find me some salvage out there."
Solen moves the cart forward further into the tundra waste land as your group talks. The rolling tundra hills become a slight blur of motion as the cart slowly gains momentum. "Hold on back there."
The cart knocks and rocks as it climbs and descends the rolling hills. Some of you can`t help but to wonder what lays ahead, or behind. This world is backward but its simple ways help you to forget the war the battles the evil the empire has brought with it.
To Solens word a few hours latter on the horizon you spot a few buildings. A couple at first then growing to larger numbers. Mostly a shell of its former glory, the town stands in ruins. Many buildings sport two to three walls. A few buildings are intact, some overgrown in brush. Solen turns the cart towards the town. "We will be there soon boys."
Murmurs ..... What was that? Chase turns looking into the town. Shaking his head did he hear something? No one else seems to have heard it. What was it if he had heard something at all? Whispers? Whispers of what?

Ruins...
Tar'ja narrows her gaze against the wind, a hidden hand in her sleeve holding her hood down a bit more. she had expected signs of an old civilization, rocks maybe..but this...was a town.
It was nothing like she expected but it now had her mind running on what they could possibly be looking for. How old was the town was a start..was there a weapon from the past maybe? plans for ships? maybe there was a hidden pile of credits...then that simple begged the question of was Tosh looking for himself, or for the Empire.

She tuned into the conversation between Chase and Solen. **"Ruins then those wastes, today or next. Anything that interests Tash interests us."** A pointed look to Dexter.

Chase held on as instructed like the others as the cart continued on over the terrain. The ground was rough per say but it was enough to throw a surprise and rock the cart now and again. He kept his focus forward not bothering ot look behind them. He figured the less he did to push Nayren's buttons, for the moment, the better. He knew now more than ever that her reaction to his past actions with Seb meant that there was still a lot of misunderstanding between them. The question was would she ever be able to put the fact that his ability with the Force and his training as a Jedi did not make him her adversary.
Pushing the thought to the back of his mind he simply watched as the wastes passed them as memories surfaced. Master Garet was prominent among them as he wondered if his former Master would approve of where he was and what he was doing. He remembered Garet once saying that the Force would lead him to many places and it was what he did when he got there is what mattered.
In the distance the what seemed to be buildings started to come into view. A dead, forgotten town formed and Solen was good to his word as to what lay ahead. It indeed was a place of ruins. It was then he heard something. ***What?*** He thought to himself as he focused more upon the buildings and the surrounding area. Again he heard what sounded like whispers that carried upon the air. Looking back to the others he searched their faces to see if they also heard it. His gaze fell on Nayren last. It was too late to hide his expression and he heard the single word she spoke. "Problem"
**"Not sure yet?"** He looked back to their destination as he drew upon the Force and reached out with his senses letting it permeate the ruins as he searched for the the source of the whispers. Upon his features and body language it was easy for his friends to see that he was focusing on something.
***Who's out here? Can anyone hear me?"*** He thought as he sent the words out through the Force like he did with Captain Runn

Tar'ja hunkered down in her seat for stability and less traction with the air. She was glad that Nayren had asked for the story of the ruins, she simply wanted to think things over rather than speak too much, a nagging in her head made her hesitate to speak too much else someone determine her race by speech alone.
Horrible thought that likely would not occur but it was better to be safe. The question to chase had her turning to him, curious of what was going on with him. Leaning to him to keep a conversational tone rather then shouting she asks "what do you feel?" she mumbles close to his ear.

Kasga sank lower in his seat and gripped the railing with his left hand. The wind made it difficult to see out here and the sand didn't help. I really didn't sign up for running around every dirtball in the galaxy. I thought I'd be flying like Kirn. 
Kasga wasn't too concerned about the ruins themselves. Sure they would be interesting, but the crashing starship was more interesting. Curious, Naryen didn't ask about that first. I'll ask when the conversation winds down. Maybe it's our lost agent. I wonder when it happened.

He felt Tar'ja lean into him as he concentrated and heard the speak softly into his ear. The warmth sent a shiver down his back. Focusing more on what may be out there than the lilac skinned beauty that sat next to him he shook his head turning it slightly towards her face. **"I don't know for sure. Could be my mind and ears playing tricks on me but I've learned to trust my instincts."** He said softly to her as he placed a comforting hand over hers that was covered by his cloak and gave a gentile squeeze.

The cart passes the rusted remains of a speeder car, as Solen turns towards the town. "This whole world was once a major agricultural port. Grow of most any kind flourished over these lands as far as the eye could see. This town is but one of many scattered across the land, left in ruins during the great shift. thousands all gone fled when the crops could not produce. Once this planet produced food for many worlds, now its a backwater pit with only a few locals to call her home." Solen`s words drift off as if in thought. Your group passes another shell of a building as you get closer into town.
Chase reaches out with the force, with his feelings. Chase trys to focus trys to reach out. What was he reaching out to? No answer. Again he try`s .... no answer. Then he hears it in the distance soft murmurs words, but muffled. Too many to make out, as the cart enters town the soft murmurs grow and grow. So many words all spoken at once Chase finds it difficult to focus on anyone word.

The ride was not the most comfortable one he had, but it was better then the cart they had back on Tatoonie roomier as well. Solen tells them how the whole world was once alive with people and farming. Now It is just a dust bowl, the land over taxed until it gave out. It must have been something to behold back then. Dexter looks around at the ruins. Fallen buildings and rumble scattered all over. This place was a treasure trove for scavengers. Most of it was probably picked throw, he would have to look around for himself sometimes people over looked things. He looks toward Solen. "Do we need to be worried about running into the local thugs here? This place would be great for setting up an ambush." He makes sure to raise his voice so he can be heard. Dexter had learned over his experiences to expect danger everywhere. Sense he had joined up with with his new friends things have just gotten more interesting to say the least.

### **master_Tru** (2011-04-24 15:46:49)

As you continue into the ruined town you hear the faint sound of buzzing. Solen stops once or twice to listen ”You hear that?” Your group pauses to listen for the sound. There it is again. The buzzing seems to come from off in the distance outside of town. Solen pushes the cart forward again and continues further into town. Everyone continues to listen and watch for the sound.
Tar`ja is the first to recognize the sound as the speeders from the port town. Before she can mention her find your group spots a speeder in mid air as it pulls a high jump off a rolling hill. The biker could be using this tactic to view distances ahead of his position. Soon after four more bikes buzz over the same hill. Your group has a sizable lead on them so making out who the bikers are is difficult. You are not sure if they can see you or not. As quickly as they appear they disappear again between the rolling tundra hills surrounding the town.
“This is not good boys, you guys must have stirred them up somehow.” Solen looks back at your group then smiles “I have a plan!” Solen turns the cart for a group of buildings then stops. “Get out and hide in the ruins. Wait for them to pass you by.” Solen opens a side compartment in the large box on the craft, from inside he pulls out a few blankets. “Here help me out.” Solen passes Dexter a blanket then grabs some rocks and rubble. Using the combination of blanket and rubble Solen covers the back end of the cart trying to make it look as though he still has passengers. “From a distance this could fool em. I will lead them out and away, then I will circle back for you all. That should give you all time to … explore. I will be back in bouts 12 hours.”
Solen waves good bye then takes off in his cart leaving your group behind. All around you the buzzing sound produced by the speeders gets louder and louder, closer and closer.

Tar'ja listened to the strange buzzing, speeders...she knew that sound. Turning to the others to inform them found that it was little use as the speeders came over the hill.
“This is not good boys, you guys must have stirred them up somehow.”
And yet he was smiling...the twi'lek under the cloak was starting to wonder about his sanity. Or perhaps this was honestly fun for him...what did he do in the past that made this fun? “I have a plan!” he says, quick thinker, finds danger fun...strange man.
Getting to the buildings she listens to his plan before leaping out "you put yourself in danger for us...they would not be pleased if they discover you had deceived them." She crosses her arms over her chest "however there is little else that would make of a good plan.." Shooting at them would only instil a fight, while they were good it was unnecessary at the moment. She looks over to the others and moves off to a building.
She watched from a shadow in the building as the sheet and rocks were placed and the speeder rushing off. Shaking her head she watches over the speeders as they come towards them "hope this works..."

Dexter helps Solen with the blankets and rubble. After they are finished he hopped his plan would work. Hiding was something Dexter had quite good at. Part of his charm he liked to think. He quickly scans the area looking for a place to hide as well as ambush an intruder if needed. He also hopped that the others where as good. After Solen had left. "Ok, I guess we should are selves at home. Finding hiding spots around here should be a problem. I will see if I can find a spot to watch for unwanted guests."
With that Dexter looks for a good place for a look out.

The sound of buzzing intermingled with the sound of the whispered voices that he had been hearing. The voices had been getting stronger as they came closer to the ruins. Unfortunately so had the buzzing noise that was making it harder to decipher the many voices he was hearing.
It wasn't long till they were jumping out looking for a place to hide. He followed Tar'ja trusting her ability to lead them to a secluded area. Hearing Tar'ja's expression that she was hoping that this works he smiled at her. **"Me too. This isn't exactly where I envisioned spending the rest of my life here."**
He caught Nayren looking at him as she finished he thought about recycled air and a long walk. "Since we're here, we could look around." She said. Her expression not very readable like normal. Though generally when she looked at him it was either some variation of irritated or angry. To be honest he was getting used to it.
**"Yes it would. It'll also be easier when the sound of the speeder bikes aren't interfering with what I was…well hearing I guess would be the best way to explain it."** He saw the look she gave him and he shrugged. **"Do you really want me to explain it?"**

Tar'ja leaned against a low wall, hiding herself and motioning Chase to kneel with her. The look given to him from Naryen made her glance between them. "This isn't the time Diedra.." she says softly, turning her hooded head so she knew she was looking at her; it was simple enough of a warning, be agitated him another day. She glances around and nods off to the sound of the buzzing "Get down, corners with the most shadows for now just until they pass us by and the sound moves far enough."
She glances to chase, whispering to him "what was it you heard?"

They were all talking when they should be trying to be quiet as possible and not drawing attention to themselves. He looked at Kasga when he mentioned about shooting himself a transport out of here. **"Shooting will only draw attention to ourselves which at this point we don't need."**
He looked around he interior of the building they were in as he reached out with the Force again. Not to sense anyone as they all knew several beings were out there but he tried to get a sense of their hiding spot wondering if it was good enough. Sometimes the Force would guide him if he focused on it. Not far from him he heard Tar'ja's voice. "What was it you heard?"
Taking a breath he looked at her never breaking his concentration. **"Voices though they were more like whispers on the wind. There were many of them and they were getting stronger the closer we came to the ruins here. Heard not with my ears though, it was through the Force."**

Solen looks at Tar`ja “I can handle myself in these parts no one knows this area better than me.”A smiling Solen waves as he accelerates away from your group in an effort to lead Tash and his men astray.
Your group is left between two buildings. One with its second story still intact, except you can hear rubble crashing down from the second story into the first. The other building has no windows, doors or even a roof but it does have four walls. Looking inside only shells of the inner walls remain, what is left of the roof now litters the floor in rubble. The windows inside are high enough to hide under, though there is little cover inside as long as no one looks inside your group should be fine.
Beyond the two closest buildings only half walls and collapsed cellars remain within sprinting distance. Looking to each other your choice is an easy one and everyone moves into the second building. Once inside your group tries to make themselves smaller in an attempt to conceal themselves from the oncoming group of bikers. I the background the buzzing of the speeder bike engines grows louder.
More mummers but of what it sounds so much closer now. Chase thinks to himself. I must be calm, I must be at peace. Chase pauses long enough to stop Kasga from shooting down a transport outta here.
There it is again ….. mummers in the force. What is it. Chase sits back down sliding against the wall falling into a cross-legged position as he was instructed to by his master, his teacher, his friend. What is the force trying to tell me, Chase thinks to himself. What am I missing? Chase feels safe as he sits within this building reaching out with his feelings the human jedi can almost see the bikes passing by outside without stopping. Feeling more comfortable Chase once again reaches farther out with the force.
The buzzing of the engines turns into a low roar as the bikes close in on your position. The bikes scream by on both sides of the building, you count four in all. Waiting a few moments you can hear the bikes moving off further away from your hiding place. Your group sits listening for the sound to be at a more comfortable distance before venturing out of the ruined building.
“Oyn Roeder.”
Chases eyes open wide was that a name? The mummers was that it? Am I hearing a name through the force? Chase thinks back, Oyn Roeder that name does not sound familiar. What could it mean?

Dexter's skills at hiding did not fail him. As the bikes roar past and after Solen he hopped new friend care of himself. "They seemed to have passed. We could always wait a few minutes to make sure." Dex had guessed that either he had riled the thugs up or they where close to something that they did not want found. "So anyone think we are where we aren't supposed to be or did we really tweek the cath hounds nose a little to hard back there?" Dexter starts to look around the building they where in to see if there was anything of value or an idea of what the building was used for.

Hearing the voices again he was looking for a calmness that the situation wasn't giving him. He took a seat sliding down the wall to the ground and assumed the natural position that he used to practice. With is legs crossed he reached out with his ability as a feeling of safeness came to him as he perceived the bikes passing even before it had happened. **"The bikes will pass. Will be safe here."** He said with a calmness and certainty to his friends
Knowing that they were safe he reached out farther with the Force as the roar of the engines became louder The reverberation caused dust and small chunks of debris to fall from the already unsafe walls. The noise and shaking didn't shake his concentration as the bikes roared past like he had seen. The murmurs were still there and he was close to understanding them. As the sound of the bikes faded he still sat there as he felt and heard the others next to him.
*Oyn Roeder.* 
His eyes came open at the words. They sounded like a name but he wasn't sure. Thinking on past memories and people he has met or heard of the possible name doesn't give any clues. He hears Dex Dex talking again. Standing up he brushed himself off quickly. **"Like I said Dex we were safe from being noticed in here. As far as being here. I think we were meant to be. I was finally able to make out what I was hearing through the Force. It sounded like a name but I'm not sure. I've never heard it before. 'Oyn Roeder.'"**  He said the two words that might be names to the other's. Maybe they have heard them before.

Chase rises soon and starts rambling on about the Force. Such wishful thinking. Not that I've ever seen it have any effect on the reality I know. It sure didn't help Kirn much. 
Chase mentions the name Oyn Roeder. Kasga just shrugged. The name didn't mean anything to him. Kasga's stomach rumbled. It had been a few hours since the cantina and Kasga didn't have other food with him. I wonder what we're going to do about that, though water is more important.

When Naryen got up, Kasga holstered his weapon and stood as well. Apparently the speeder bikes are no longer a threat. Turning his head, Kasga glances around a little, but he's got something else on his mind.
He heads over closer to Naryen to speak to her. **"Ma'am, I didn't want to suggest this while Solen was around. Have you considered hacking the Imperial computer system on this planet?

No she didn't know it. Why would the voices speak of that? wasn't it supposed to be helpful?
A faint mutter of unhelpful force-voices and finding a place to grenade them spilled from her lips. The others were right, time to look around a bit, see what might be useful there.

Your group waits inside the building until the buzz of the speeder bikes fades into the distance. Peeking around the corner you confirm your suspicions that Tash and his gang are gone at least for now. Dexter makes a quick check around the room but finds nothing except rubble and walls.
Kasga scans the area but also finds nothing. Daring to step outside Kasga looks out to the closest buildings, which are little more the rubble in comparison to the building your group hide within. Beyond that about a block away a few more buildings stand mostly intact, one of which supports a dome roof.
Confused by the name Qyn Roeder Chase moves outside with Kasga to scan the area. Outside The human notices the domed building among the next bunch of buildings, then he hears the murmurs again. Looking at the buildings the murmurs seem to be coming from inside. It seems that Chase could only make out the name when he was focused, now that he is not focusing the name has returned to murmurs.
Tarj`a takes a spot at Chases side, followed by Naryen then Dexter. Taking another moment to listen and scan for the speeders your group is satisfied they are gone, lone gone. Yet at the same time you do not see or hear any sign of Solen as well.

When the sound of the speeder bikes can no longer be heard They all seemed to wander out of the almost falling down hiding place they had been using. Stepping up beside Kasga who ventured out first his gaze fell upon what seemed to be the only sound structure around. The small domed building seemed to be in the middle of the next set of ruins. Since he had lost his focus the voice had returned to a murmur again. Yet there was no mistaking that that structure was where the voice was coming from.
Hearing Kasga voice his opinion about it made him smile. ***So you can think for yourself and not have to run everything through Nayren. That's good. I can understand his wanting to follow a chain of command but not being to think for oneself was even a greater limitation then just following orders.*** He thought as he nodded to the Duros.
**"I think you're right Kasga. I think there is something inside that dome. One I'm very interested in finding out about."** He looked at Nayren and then Tar'ja who he winked at. **"Shall we check it out?"**
As he closed in on the small building he sharpened his focus as he once again reached out with the Force and to the voice that he had heard. Silently and in his head repeated the name he had heard ***Oyn Roeder.***

With the group in agreement you all move forward towards the new cluster of buildings. Cautiously you make your way through buildings of half collapsed walls and piles of rubble.
More murmurs through the force.
As you near the cluster of buildings you notice they are in much the same disrepair as the building you had taking shelter within. Partial walls, open gaps where roof tiles use to be. Rubble litters this area slowing your progress somewhat.
Chase continues to focus trying once again to use his feelings to guide him to the voice, the name he had heard before. More murmurs through the force.
Moving towards the domed building you can see that it is mostly intact. No doors or windows remain, having long since been scavenged or destroyed. Inside you can see a central shaft leading from the top of the dome and through the wooden floor. Amongst the debris inside you can make out what use to be bench seating throughout the single common room building. Worn paintings still hang periodically along the walls, and the remains of a torn curtain flutter in the breeze.
Still reaching out through the force Chase can hear the murmurs louder now though still distorted. More murmurs through the force.
Standing just outside the double entrance of the domed building your group cautiously scans the area for signs of danger, or of Tash and his gang. At your feet a half buried statue can be seen broken into multiple pieces, though the frozen stance of crossed hands is clearly visible.
Chase can sense the force within this place, but does not know why. He maintains his focus on the murmurs trying to isolate the voice the name Oyn Roeder. To the humans surprise he instead hears …..

<strong>Again, destruction to those that don&#39;t conform.</strong>**.**
Naryen considered Kasgas suggestion thoughtfully **"Info to be gained but I expect few others would be trying to access their net thus it would probably draw more attention than is worth the risk. The last procedure for backwaters I was aware of is to leave the front door open but the guards in the data-room."** She shrugged. **"Makes for a more effective trap that way. Anything useful is likely kept off-net anyway since there's likely not much of a net here anyway. Probably kept on Tashes personal stores."** Dexter had been a little quiet so she tried to call on his expertise by asking him directly: **"What do you think?"**
When it was clear that they weren't going to leave an outlook and spotter she went with the group to the ruins. ***Probably better that we don't stay conspicuous in the open anyway.***
Looking around the room it was clear that this building was imbued with intent and care. ***Again, an end to those that don't conform.*** She wondered if it's destruction was done at Imperial hands and bitterly looked for scorch marks.
Feeling a little out of her element, Naryen divided her attention between the cultural artifacts in the room and watching Chase for twitches like she would a rad sensor. Drawing on what she knew of her own diverse culture to see if there was anything she could volunteer. Watching Chase felt like she was Profiling during a PsyOps exam. She hated them almost as much as she excelled at them.

Tar'ja followed the others, scanning the dome as they come to it from beneath her hood; she was not about to take chances when it came to this...even in the sun with a sweltering cloak she'd not remove it.
Stepping over pieces of sculpture she takes a pause to kneel before the clasped hands on the ground. Lifting them a bit to examine them she turns her gaze to the others and the doors. She heard Naryen question and she had to agree "I think...this was a..a place of worship.." Old though it likely was..she couldn't think of any religions in existence, then again she likely wouldn't have payed attention had she known of them.
Organized religion wasn't the same as crime, killing, hiding in shadows and the like; at least not for her, and she didn't need the idea of some jerk of a diving watching all her moves and judging her for the rest of her existence. She'd gotten off track in her thoughts as she stands, picking her way through the rubble of statues to look for a head, maybe it might help to determine if it was praying, crying, maybe even the race.

Naryen didn't seem to think his idea had merit. It would be risky and probably not worth it in the end. Given the locals penchant for picking a fight, Kasga expected to have at least one of them to question sooner or later. Kasga shrugged it off and started poking about in the new building.

As they headed for the domed building his senses were open to the slightest of things. Though he wasn't looking at her he could "feel" Nayren watching him with a level of caution he had come to expect from her as of late. He could also feel the growing presence of the building within the Force as they neared.
Standing in front of the building Both Nayren and Tar'ja were searching for a meaning to the place. The broken statue gave a forced sense of that the place might have been a place of meditation.  ***Some sort of Force tradition practiced here maybe. It would make sense.*** He was pretty sure that it wasn't Jedi. There were many other users of the Force that didn't follow the Jedi code.
**"Nayren,"**  He said as he looked over the building as they stood in front of it. **"You don't have to watch me like a Nexu watches its prey."** The tone of his voice and the slight smile on his face showed that there was no malice in his words. **"I can only imagine what you learned of the Jedi from your Imperial officer training and I'm guessing that it was very biased and skewed from their point of view. The Jedi were guardians of the Galaxy for a thousand generations before the Emperor and Vader wiped out the Order not so long ago."**
He looked at the statue. **"The Force itself is strong here. Isolated to this particular building I don't know why but it is an interesting find."** Maintaining his concentration as he spoke with his friends clearly showed him that he was becoming stronger and more at ease with his use of the Force. **"It could have been a place of learning where whatever Force tradition that may have been here practiced their ways. Or,"** His voice trailed off for a second. **"Master Garet told me that a place that saw great sacrifice could leave a Force imprint on a location but this doesn't feel like that."**
Reaching out again to hear the name that he had heard earlier his head cocked to the side slightly, as he heard a different name, something he was sure that Nayren would notice. With his own voice he repeated the new name. **“Torm Arlos. Well that's a different name.”** He looked within the building and tried something different. ***My name is Chase Davion.*** He said to himself as he projected the words out through the Force.

Tar'ja watches him, glancing over to the imperial and back again, "Naryen...we're going to need to talk about this when we've got a safer place to do it. for now...do stop treating him like an insect." She calls, her voice was even, but there wasn't a hint that she was joking...
Turning back to the doors she tests them briefly before tugging or pushing them to get it open. chase's words of the Jedi was interesting, something she filed away for later talkings but for now..there was buisness to attend to. "What if this isn't a place that force peoples studied...can you feel force peoples inside?" she asks, maybe someone was living here.

**"I don't know Tar'ja. It could have been a place of training. I'm guessing mostly."** He looked over at her and wondered how she could stand being covered up by his cloak in this heat.
**"I don't feel a living person inside but I do feel presences within the Force."** He gave her a smile and indicated the hood that was covering her head. **"I think we're from prying eyes for the moment you could let the hood down for a while."**

<strong>And a shun to those from outside that dare impose themselves within..</strong>**.**
Naryen smirked at Chases comment. Her apprehension from being near a Jedi, who fit all the propaganda of a reckless and arrogant self appointed agent of righteousness, abated somewhat at his seemingly genuine invitation of banter. She readied her salvo and opened her mouth to respond in kind. ***Interesting analogy. Some would argue a predator is prey to it's instincts and power over its quarry. It shows some self awareness that you see yourself that way…***
... that is how she *would* have started ...
With her lips still parted she stared at Tar'ja with wider eyes and an expression empty of humour with a sprinkle of shock. Did she misread Chases intentions? Is she misreading Tar'jas? She furrowed her brow slightly and closed her mouth. Looking back to Chase then Tar'ja, then Chase she opened her mouth again, but the moment had passed. She looked down, then away. She walked away from them as they talked to each other.
Her face felt warm as she turned away further to hide a flush. Her expression reflected her inner turmoil that swirled like an angry swarm. Her confusion scrambled for a foothold and found none. The realization was both magnifying and arresting.
It hurt.
A feeling of betrayal from the two that she felt knew her any, if at all, surged forward, like blood from a wound inflicted by a once trusted ally.
***They'll never accept you!***
It hurt.
***Silence!***
She stepped, seeing but not seeing where she was going...
***They've seen so much of you and now they taunt and attack you!***
It hurt.
***Silence!***
She walked around a bit of stone here, wood there...
***Either he'll kill you or his slave girl will!***
It hurt.
***Silence!***
She closed her eyes and held her hands to her stomach, that now lurched, and took another few steps.
Naryen stood, and breathed. Slow and controlled so as not to sob aloud. Wiping a tear from the top of one cheek she looked at the ground, then the wall in front of her. Before what was there registered a thought washed away her pain and left a blank face behind.
***Everything dies.***

Dexter searched around the building they where in a little more. Mostly half heartedly. Kasaga and some of the others where checking another building out or something. Chase was doing what ever it was that Jedi do in these situations, Tar'ja hovering over. *"Well I suppose someone needs to find happiness in this mess where in."*He thinks to himself. Dex had known happiness twice once when his parents where still alive and the other with the person they where looking for now. The rest was just physical.
He walks around a bit more and then finds a spot and close to where his friends where and sets quietly. Until Solen returned they didn't need to wonder off to far. Besides if safety was anywhere it was here. Tar'ja may not like Dex much, but he was pretty sure she was top predator around these ruins.

Tar'ja was stilling looking to the door and the remains of statues, her mind working over the items as though trying to work out a puzzle. She loved puzzles. It pushed her mind to see around things look for other answers. Logical puzzles, riddles, she liked those best. things that didn't have one answer but many, like a building she was trying to infiltrate, more than one way in and out and often times many of those were over looked.
She wasn't quite sure why the steps of her soul-sister had wandered away, wasn't sure what had gotten to her this time, but in the presence of a puzzle, she was having difficulty working around her. "Someone go and make sure she doesn't wander far.." she says faintly, tone clearly distracted as she worked the door. There was some kind of answer in there and she wanted to know what it was.
A pause stops her hands to look over to the Jedi, a faint tilt of head really "too open." she responds. they didn't know what was above them, if there was sneaking like she did that she hadn't caught yet, no. The best chance was to continue to hide, make it harder for them to see so if they caught them they'd never see the knife she brought into their back. damnable spies..never as good as her. Her thoughts were running away from the puzzle, focus.
"Did I say something wrong to her?" she asks, talking..she would be the first to admit, likely not her best suit if it wasn't intimidating or followed by a blaster shot, had something she said offended the woman? "Do humans believe themselves akin to insects? was that an insult to her?"

As Dex was setting waiting for Solen to return. He hears Tar'ja say something about following Naryen. He jumps up and follows after her. "Hey wait up." He says to her. Truth was there was nothing much to do and being alone in this place was not the best of ideas. As he caught up to Naryen. "So. What do you think used to go on in some of these buildings? I'd like to find the nearest cantenna. I could use a drink." Dex smiles at the last comment. Small talk would help past the time.

Your group pauses at the doorway trying to decide what to do. Around you the ruins hold fast to all its secrets. The sky is clear of all but a few clouds, the surrounding hills hold no signs of man or beast.
Naryen states the obvious, that staying out into the open might not be the best idea. Kasga nods and continues to scan the horizon waiting for someone or the group to come to a consensus. If Tash`s men come back your group would be easily spotted out in the open.
Tar`ja considers that the building was used in some form of worship. Chase agrees though the jedi`s thoughts are focused elsewhere. Confused the human considers the meaning behind the two separate names.
Dexter searches around the building, looking inside the windows the Bothan spots worn blaster score marks signs of a long forgotten battle. As he reaches inside with his head the Bothan`s trained ears perk, he can hear voices. Straining to make it out all Dex can make out is the sound of murmurs as if the source of the voices is muffled inside another room within.
When did Solen say he would be back? "Bouts 12 hours." Your group has time to spare at the moment.
Confused Chase considers what the building could have been used for and by who. His master had mentioned several other force religions, Chase had even heard of a few in his own travels. So many that without more information he could not even make an educated guess.
The Jedi hears the murmurs again, now closer to the building the jedi finds it easier to make out the names now. This time Chase hears "Shamara Darmal." What could that mean? The jedi mulls over the three names he has felt through the force now Qyn Roeder, Torm Arlos and now Shamara Darmal. Who are they?
As the jedi ponders its meaning he hears another name "Rachel Starwalker" then another "Kodai Kahn." Closer to the source Chase can feel, sense more of the source but still very little. The names are spoken by different voices all spoken softly. Chase try`s but he is still unable to identify more about the voices. Looking inside the building Chase is sure the source in within.

Dex walks with Naryen , still looking around in the building wondering what might have happened here. When he hears something very faint. It sounded like voices. "That is strange." He said to himself. His friends where all close enough that it couldn't have been them. He heads over toward a window where the sound was coming from. There was blaster marks on it as well, but given where they where it was not to surprising. He tried to figure out what direction they where coming from. Another room under the rubble could have been likely, but he doubted that.
((OCC:Preseption +9 Basically while Dex is at the window he going to stand and listen to he if he can figure out which direction the voices are coming from and if he can get to them.))

Chase could feel the emotions surge through Nayren as she turned away. With him so open to the Force at the moment as he tried to connect with whatever was here it was so very easy to pick up on the turbulence that flowed through her emotions. He sighed and looked down as she walked away and Tar'ja's question sounded in his ear. Her words intermingled with the other names that he was now hearing. Each one came with its own voice.
Looking at Tar'ja his face a mask of concentration. **"I don't know. Maybe. She's hurting. I can feel the emotions radiation out from her. Out of all of us here I think she's been through the most and she hasn't really had time to come to terms with it all. It doesn't that I am what she was taught to distrust, hate and hunt down with extreme prejudice. Then you add in the fact that you two have developed a sisterly bond of some sort and that we're now involved isn't helping the situation. It could feel like we're coming down on or opposing her."** He looked back into the small building as the names sounded out again. **"I think we all need to sit down and talk and soon."** He didn't want to say it but perhaps the relationship between Tar'ja and himself could be hurting the cohesiveness of their team. He let out a sigh of frustration but held his focus.
**"Three more names. All the names are spoken by a different voice probably the one that belongs to it. Maybe something happened here. Something terrible."** A hollow feeling formed in the pit of his stomach. Shoring up his resolve he quickly took a step into the building where the source of the presences are originating from. ***Perhaps within the nexus of this site I can manage more information or even contact.***
Letting his reservations go about his relationship and what was happening among the team he presented himself as he entered opening himself up to the Force. ***What happened here?*** His thoughts carried out into the Force.

Tar'ja frowned faintly, she knew they all needed to talk, but did Naryen realize the wisdom in that? Who knew a relationship in anyone could be so....
*troublesome*
she mutters into her mind, watching the Jedi move forward and shakes her head, following after him quickly to take on a more protective stance. Fool...walking into a place distracted as he was someone could shoot and he may never know it!
"What are the new names." She asks him softly, searching the area as she follows him, her hand resting on her blaster as she surveys the area "After this place..when we're back in the sky, we find a port or we take some time and the three of us are going to talk." She glances to him, she wasn't really asking. but still liked to ensure that he was agreeing with her notion.

He felt her surprise and maybe a small amount of worry, that he knew that she wouldn't admit, that he entered so quickly. Without turning to her he answered her question. **"Shamara Darmal, Rachel Starwalker and Kodai Kahn."** A moment later he spoke again. **"Don't worry you won't need your blaster, there is no one around for miles and yes we three need to talk. Which should prove to be in interesting conversation."**
Turning his head he looked at the lilac colored beauty, who must be suffering since she was still wearing his cloak, that stood next to him and smiled. **"Thanks for coming in with me."**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

Tar'ja scoffs faintly, glad for the cloak to hide that damn flushing of blood to her cheeks "As though I'd let you wander off without me." she says, a faint hint of teasing in her tone. At least some what alone it wasn't too necessary to keep affection from her voice..she did feel that after all, she had come to terms with it.
Clearing her throat, and poking his side she chuckles "who do you suppose these people were? have the voices given any....useful information?"

Chase's idea of a conversation is curious. Kasga glanced back toward the other building where Naryen and Dex had remained. **"What sort of conversation do we need to have?"**
Kasga thought a moment. **"Surely this isn't about Naryen's indoctrination clashing with your flaky view of the world?"**

---

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2011-05-23 23:43:36)

Chase shook his head at Tar'ja's question. **"No. Only names nothing else. The Force will show me what it wants to. Hard to understand I know. I'm finally coming to terms with it myself. I was always wanting to know right then when something was shown to me. I finally learned enough patience to accept that things will reveal themselves when needed and no amount of wishing will make it come sooner."**
Silence hung in the air for a few seconds and as if on queue he heard Kasga's voice behind him. **"Believe what you will Kasga. How you think I view the world is but one mans view, yours. If we all looked at things the same way we would all be the same mindless drone that the Emperor has created within his Empire. An Empire that does not accept you simply because you aren't human. Take yourself for example. Your need for the clear cut command structure has almost paralyzed your individual thinking to the point to where you run everything past Nayren who was an Imperial officer. Your former enemy."** He looked around the room for a brief second before continuing. **"So I ask you, who has the flaky view of the world. And I understand your reason for command as I once had one that I looked to for guidance."** Using Kasga's own words he turned sideways facing Tar'ja but his head continued to turn to look at the Duros. **"We have all come from vastly different backgrounds and therefore we all have a different, maybe even flaky, views of the universe. That is what makes this a good team. We take in all the angles when something is presented to us. I'm not asking you to understand my abilities and what I can do. Just don't assume that it some flaky stuff that is all made up. The Force led me to you in the alleyway back on Tatooine and my journey to take Rasen's belongings back to Dosnenna led us to Nayren, Tar'ja and Dexter. The five of us meeting was the will of the Force. Of that I have no doubt. You may call it flaky. I choose to call it, destiny."** He said with a raised eyebrow as he cocked his head slightly to the side as he shrugged the shoulder that his head angled towards.
As he looked at Kasga Chase had kept his cool. That had surprised him somewhat. It also showed him that he was learning to control his feelings and not let anger rule his thinking. Kasga had a point. The talk that needed to happen needed to be done with all five of them not just with Nayren, Tar'ja and himself.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **galenbd** (2011-05-24 12:32:23)

Kasga chortles as Chase airs his assumptions and justifies his actions. **"Destiny, hah. I've never seen it do anything worthwhile. It's no different than H'kig religion and just as blind to the technology we use. Maybe you delude yourself into thinking it controls you or your destiny, but no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny.
And the Empire was Kirn's enemy, not mine. I just do what needs to be done as well as I can. Before Kirn recruited me, I tried to do that while keeping my head down. Now, I'm not sure how I got so far from there. You guys must be a bad influence on me causing my apathy to evaporate."**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2011-05-24 15:19:47)

Once again Chase sighs as he sees the angry reaction from Kasga. His voice was strong yet he held the calmness to his tone. **"I'm not familiar with his H'kig religion but can you really make the basis that because someone or some group that follows a different path than the majority is wrong? That their beliefs and traditions are flaky just because they are different. No you can't. Each person takes their own path. Weather one believes it's destiny or not is up to the individual. I'll admit that it even took me awhile to come to terms with it."**
He shrugged his shoulders. More than once he had had this type of conversation with people and it generally turned out the same. People had to agree to disagree on some things. **"Look I'm not here to tell anyone what to do or how to plod on through their life. Yet if one can't see that the Empire stands against everybeing that wants the ability to make their own decisions on how to live, then in my opinion they have a blast helmet pulled down over their eyes. If they don't want to lift that helmet and take a look around then they subject themselves to the life that they are in instead of trying to make it better. I know you won't see what I'm trying to explain. I wasn't ready either at first. We're in a fight against the Empire plain and simple. If this isn't the fight you wanted you've had plenty of chances to go. Yet you are still here willing to fight for each and every one of us I think.**
He shook his head once again. **"Let's agree to disagree for the time being. This isn't really the place for this conversation."**. He nodded his head at Kasga as he reoriented his focus that had slipped a bit as he talked.
***I wish the presences here would hurry up already.***. He thought as impatience slipped into his thoughts.

Tar'ja watched the pair silently before sighing, she wasn't sure what she believed in be is luck, destiny, force or ancestors but she could see the wisdom in at least being thankful that they had all come together. Shaking her head faintly to them she mutters something about males before wondering off again to search the building.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Rebaav** (2011-05-24 21:46:22)

<strong>&#8230;What?&#8230;</strong>**.**
Naryen felt better and a little worried. Why was she so sensitive? It was like... and there it was. She had a seriously underdeveloped emotional immune system! These challenges were more than she was equipped to handle, so far.
She sighed inwardly. ***Patience. All things with time.***
After Naryen took a moment to compose herself, away from prying eyes, she heard Kasgas inquiry and claim to personal choice and Chase admonish the other's point of view.
***Just as the Emperor would want. Opposition for oppositions sake.***
Naryen stood baffled as he painted with such a wide brush. ***Is this how I was? How others still see me? Am I still that way?*** The questions caused her core to wither.
She rallied against the feeling and smiled in spite of Chases blunt stumbling with Kasga. Speaking in her best estimation of a nerf herder she herd once in an old video-play she tried, again, to see if Chase would pay attention to anything but his own perspective.
While facing Kasga, with a hand on one hip and a dismissive flip of the other to Chase. **"Ne'er ya mind this here Preacher-man. Like ah good preacher 'e got mouth fer ears 'n mush fer brains so 'e can't listen to 'iz own werdz ne'er mind yurz"** She walked towards Chase, tone and body language sliding back into her own chill with every word/step, if a bit colder than usual. **"If yer done makin more enimies fer yursef, Preacher, can you tell if these voices, belongin ta others, are echoes from the past or should we start calling their names back to get their attention?"**
She was careful not to look at Tar'ja. Something about that exchange earlier still stung.
Though she was now seemingly relaxed, hands on her hips, she looked up defiantly into Chases eyes and waited for him to try something other than picking a fight with their Duros pilot by being so infuriatingly dismissive of him. She raised her brows slightly. The ***Well?*** should be obvious to everyone but she had a moment where she doubted he would get it and tucked the thought away for later to amuse herself with.

As Tar'ja shook her head only to turn away to look about the room he spotted Nayren saunter in through the door way passing Kasga who still stood outside. ***Here we go again. I guess it's going to happen now.*** He thought as his eyebrow raised as she gave her performance. Her tone and body language screamed confrontation yet held a coldness that he had come to expect from her. Watching he saw her position herself between himself and Tar'ja. He wasn't sure if she was protecting her or avoiding having to look at her friend. ***Interesting. Maybe what had been said earlier hurt her more than she would ever let on.*** Inwardly he sighed as all this was doing was creating a rift among them. Dividing them down the middle. It was a problem as Nayren wasn't one to back down. He knew her well enough to know that. ***Thing is her problem is always with me. Are we that much alike but just at different ends of the spectrum? We certainly rub each other the wrong way. Do we even know we're doing it?***
He turned to face her and angled his head to look at the smaller woman who stood before him. He hooked his thumbs into his belt. **"Preacher man. Is that how you really see me? I give a strong voice to what I have seen and experienced and I'm classified as a preacher man. I'm not telling anyone to take what I say as the way it has to be. I want people to be able to make their own decisions not be told what to do. So what if you or anyone else view my beliefs as flaky. Weather they believe in the Force or not. It doesn't matter. Weather they believe that there is a destiny for each no matter how big or small. It's up to them to decide."** He looked at Kasga before looking at Nayren. **"Isn't people thinking for themselves a good thing? Allowing them to draw their own conclusions. You were finally able to see what the Empire really was. Unfortunately it took a travesty of immense proportions and personal loss to open your eyes."** He paused for a moment his own blue eyes locked with hers. **"You know I'm beginning to realize something and I'm sure that you will deny it. We are more alike than either of us wants to come to terms with. Thing is we're at opposite ends of the spectrum. We both feel strongly about what we believe in and perhaps that equally jades our views on things."** He shrugged his shoulders holding his palms at his sides open before her. **"Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right. And for your information and everyone else I have been trying to get their attention. Do you think we can stop being equally hard headed just for a short amount of time? Maybe we'll find out what this place was for. Personally I'm tired of butting heads with you."** He raised his own eyebrows to her in his own attempt at what she did to him. He felt foolish doing it but it seemed right given the circumstance.

Tar'ja had taken a pause in her wondering of the room to watch the exchange, Chase was right...she hadn't seen it before but there it was, they were like the same person in different bodies..weird..
She sighed faintly at the end and the stare contest began; she wanted to speak up, to tell them they were both making bad choices, that naryen was looking at every twitch he made as an insult to her existence and that with how often they bumped heads if Chase was doing some things on purpose just to get the rise out of her; possibly an unconscious thought but there it was.
She wanted to tell them that they both needed to take stock of how they been acting and how they treat each others view, especially when it comes to the Empire..Kasga wasn't helping either. She knew what it was to listen to someone who was higher that oneself in status but honestly he looked uncomfortable sneezing without asking if it was alright. They all had issues, they were all a bit...well...they were a rag-tag group of mismatched people that likely wouldn't have chosen each other for anything if they had a choice in the matter.
She liked it...it was different, they were all different, groups weren't supposed to be compatible right away, it took work, that's how she always viewed it.
She had noticed as well that Naryen wasn't looking at her, had even put her back to her. Maybe she really did think she was an insect...squish able, expendable, unwanted by majority of people, usually under the rule of a larger of the same kind.....hm..maybe there was something to this...a mental note was made to attempt to reeducate her spirit-sister that she was not an insect, and more so, not an insect under the empire anymore.

Chase steps inside the building, just within the open doorway itself. Tar`ja follows the mans lead stopping at his side. Within old blaster score marks can be seen randomly along the walls. The single room building is large and spacious, any sign of decoration long gone. In the middle of the room a large column extends from the ceiling to the floor. As you enter the room the wooden floor boards creak and groan in protest to your presents.. The jedi feels distracted as he continues the conversation, the names continue without clue as to reason or origin.
Another soft voice "Ryn Yung"
Discovering a possible fire fight Dexter keeps this information to himself as he continues to explore the building from the outside. The muffled voices concern the Bothan but he is unable to determine any new information on their source from outside the building.
Another soft voice "Karav Jax"
None of you have ever been prepared for this. Your group has in a short time become a group a team like no other any of you have been a part of before. Small and versatile each of you provide a unique perceptive to the group as a whole. In many ways despite your differences you have become more then a team.
Outside the building you remember Tash`s men and Solen`s bravery. You still have a mission, and with some of your group standing outside the door of a domed building within a ruined town has you feeling a little exposed to the surrounding hills.
Still in conversation Chase hears another voice. This one is soft like the others. Through the force like the others. Unlike the others this one hits the jedi like a transparasteel door. Chase turns flush white, the first name he has heard only a few times in his life, but the last name .......
"Leo Garet"

As he and Nayren conversed the names of people continued to softly make themselves known. He wasn't sure where their conversation was going to lead them but he had a feeling that it wasn't going to be pleasant. Yet he didn't want to mince words with her like this. His earlier revelation seemed more fitting now. They were alike just vastly different.
**"Look I…"** The words choked off and left his mouth hanging open. Without warning he felt like he had been hit by something solid. His posture changed as his face slackened. Blue eyes that were staring into Nayrens shifted ever so slightly and they now seemed to be looking through her or possibly into her very being. He didn't move for a few seconds as he simply stood there Looking at her.
***Leo Garet***
**"Leo Garet"** He said the name with the same inflection that a son would use when recalling a lost parent. The man was the closest thing to a father he had known. He didn't bother to explain as they had all heard the name before. They were smart enough to put two and two together.
Quickly and with no warning he spun away from Nayren and moved to the center of the room. Their conversation no longer in the forefront of his mind.
***Could it be? Are all these names of fallen Jedi or Force practitioners in general who have fallen?***
He turned around to face the door and sat down assuming a position that required no effort as it was one he had taken more times than he could recall. With his eyes closed he spoke. **"I think the names are Force users that had died.** Taking a breath he re-centered himself opening himself wide to the Force. He focused on Master Garet remembering every detail of the fallen Jedi Master in some hope that he might somehow finally understand what this was.
***Master Garet. It's Chase.*** He said with a purpose no longer hesitant like before when he reached out to the voices earlier. He didn't know what else to do. This was something totally new to him.

Tar'ja looked over sharply at the sudden stop of speech from Chase, what was going on now? a new name? harder to make out?
"Leo Garet"
Her lekku twitched under her hood, oh no...he spoke often enough of his late master that she knew that last name. She moves to him quickly, crouching down beside him "it's your master? are you certain?" She glances up to the woman, she wondered if she would understand...she remember that room with the woman before her crying; so much death...she didn't care about her own 'family' she was glad when she took their lives, but this was a person that didn't deserve death from what chase had talked about...and she was certain that Naryen hadn't deserved what deaths she'd witnessed.
Maybe this would bring them together.

<strong>&#8230;What!?&#8230;</strong>**.**
It all came to her in a rush as she saw the group losing cohesion with every passing moment. A trained operative drifting back into his solitary ways. A slave seemingly more concerned with staying a concubine then making her own decisions. A thug pilot desperate to strike out on his own but feeling a pull to a greater cause. And an idiot trying so hard to keep them together but seeming to just be driving them apart.
Then there's rampaging hypocritical Preacher invoking chaos like a demented force of nature given flesh.
Naryen was getting desperate, trying anything, to keep things moving forward. That Chase would actually try to so blatantly pick a fight with Kasga at such a brazenly inappropriate time...! She tried to wedge humour between them and then bring Chases attention to her and then back to task. The first part appeared to work as Preacher seemed to direct his monologue at her. The second part, bringing him to task, seemed to fail miserably.
She didn't expect it, that enough was enough to surprise her, but there it was: ***By all the mothers ice, he's still talking! Did he even hear my question? I walked right up to him! Should I have slapped him first!?*** She was only joking with herself, to keep her mood up, that Chase would actually barrel on in his preaching and ignore her question but he actually did! It stunned her. For reasons she couldn't fathom she actually expected more from him and her expectations let her down. With effort she stood there, just as she was, as Chase continued to talk, and talk, at apparently no-one.
Naryen recalled some of the details about Jedi she was trained on. The relevant part was their perceptions having more temporal fluidity. How they could drift their focus from past to future was speculation but the empirical evidence led to many tactics to use it against them, distracting and misleading them. All she wanted to know was if the roll-call Chase was hearing was past, present, or future. The rage simmered quietly in the background as exasperation took full stage in her mind.
***Perhaps he has some defect where talking out-loud is the only way he can reason? Side effect of being a Jedi?*** She used that thought to invoke patience in herself as Chase continued his monologue.
"Look I..."
***Shards! Mr I'll-have-the-last-word-by-having-every-word is starting again! Is he stuck in a logic loop?***
Her eyes widened and she opened her mouth, to try to interrupt the next sermon, when Chases demeanor suddenly shifted. Naryens senses darted over his person and out to her surroundings. ***Did he just get shot?…No.***
**"Leo Garet"** Naryens focus came back to Chase, her hands coming off her hips as she observed him again, hearing the emotion in his voice. The name is familiar, probably someone important to Chase given his reaction. Perhaps he mentioned it to her before?
Tar'ja volunteered some clarity: **"it's your master? are you certain?"** ***Ah, something he can relate to personally so it gets his attention, of course.***
Chase walked away, apparently no longer interested in preaching his sermon. Naryen watched him for a moment then turned to Kasga who she offered an apologetic look and a shrug and a little shake of the head for having failed at re-engaging the Jedi. She directed her focus back to her surroundings and tried to find some use for herself. Looking around the inside of the building she noted construction given available resources and age but nothing else noteworthy.
Chase spoke, perhaps to the group, perhaps no-one, it was hard for Naryen to tell. **"I think the names are Force users that had died."**
Was that an answer to her question? She pondered it a moment then decided that it was just Chase and his focus to distraction on his "Force" sense with all other senses being forgotten as unneeded distractions, including the one labeled "Common".
Given the state of the surrounding buildings did Chase even check to see if the floor he boldly stepped onto was sound?
Since she was near the inside wall by the entrance Naryen crossed her arms and leaned up against it. It was not a posture she was used to, so it was physically quite uncomfortable, but it somehow seemed appropriate. She opened up her own focus on everything else she could in the room.
Conscious of her pistol so close to her hand she recalled the historical critique she wrote about Order 66 during her time in the Imperial Academy. She felt glad she had never submitted it.

Kasga could see this conversation was not going to end any time soon. Chase couldn't seem to keep focused upon it. He was plenty focused when he was given space to speak. Once anyone else had an opinion, he seemed quite distracted. No matter. He can pay attention to the might have beens. I have work to do here.
Kasga returned Naryen's look with raised eyebrows and a matching shrug. **"I'll check the perimeter. Wish I had my rifle."**
He walks back toward the building's openings. He stays in earshot, but slowly looks around the horizon.

Another name "Cale Sinan." This time Chase did not notice, the man barley registers the new name as it is spoken within his mind. The jedi launches himself towards the center of the room, with Tar`ja close on his heels.
Just as Naryen`s back rested against the back wall and as Kasga turns to check the area everyone hears a loud crunch! The floor boards beneath the jedi give way into a splinter of chaos. Tar`ja forces herself to a stop managing only by the tips of her toes not to fall inside the newly opened hole in the floor which extends about 2 meters wide. The Twi`lek stands at the edge poised to fall or stand, the woman's arms swinging wildly trying to maintain her balance.
Chase falls into darkness .....
With a thump the jedi lands on his back, having fallen nine meters to the basement floor below. (13 damage from the fall to Chase) Dust, floor boards and darkness cloud Chases vision as he lays flat on his back.
Before anyone can shout out is everyone ok Chase hears another name.
"Ram Parsa"
This time everyone hears the name. A soft voice as if it drifted out on a slow breeze. You are unable to make out if the voice is male or female. The soft voice is too low for any real identification.

Tar'ja followed close at the Jedi's heels, he was so focused within himself on the name...he could wander into a fire fight at this point, didn't his master teach him anything abou- "Whoa!"
She cries out, arms flailing to give her some balance as she teetered, watching helplessly as the Jedi fell. Arching her back she aims to fall backward to safe ground again, stumbling back a few steps, her hood had fallen back during the encounter.
That damn fool of a human! she rushes to the edge again to look down, lips parting to call out to him only to have her speech caught in her throat.
"Ram Parsa"
She heard that...she heard that name...but...but how? She turns faintly to look over her shoulder to her spirit-sister wide eyed. He wasn't some crazy preacher like she thought..he was really hearing names..and now they could hear the voice..
Turning back to the hole she calls out "Chase! say something if you're still alive!"

### **Yogi** (2011-05-27 17:23:57)

Chase hears and feels the floor board creak under his weight but pays them no pause. With his masters name still resonating within him action was careless as he focused on the past with out looking to the present and the possible dangers that might be present.
From beneath him the creaking becomes louder almost deafening in the instant it happened. **"Look ou…"** He exclaimed and despite putting his hands out to the side the floor that was beneath him disintegrated and he was falling into the darkness.
**"Ooof"** The air from his lungs exploded out as he impacted what had to be the floor. A warm wetness begin to dampen his back left shoulder. In his mind he remembered the guidance of Master Garet as he had said to him many times in the past as he gasped for air to return to his lungs. ***Patience young Chase. Patience.***
"Ram Parsa" Another name floated out from the Force. It sounded like the others.
A loud groan escaped him a he struggled to sit. A sharp pain shot though his shoulder as well as numerous others that resulted from the fall. Laying back down his right hand fumbled through his utility belt as he sought the glow-rod that was tucked away in one of the pouches. In the darkness that surrounded him he found the device and turned it on illuminating the area around him as he lay still.
Taking a breath he looked up from where he had fallen from. Dust and stale air entered his lungs causing him to cough sending another wave of pain through his body. He could see Tar'ja peering down from the hole he had created and heard her yell down to him. He slowly waved the hand that held the glow-rod as his breathing was coming easier despite the coughing. Still laying on his back he sought the strength to yell up. **"I'm…ok."** He coughed again. **"I'm going to hurt for days."** Letting out a cough he let his head fall to the side the glow rod lighting up a small area.

### **zerah** (2011-05-27 17:54:38)

Tar'ja breathed a small sigh of relief that he was alright and then she started **"what the hell is wrong with you!? I understand being upset about a voice talking about your master but you could have gotten yourself killed!! I highly doubt there had ever been a time that your master blindly walked in a place he didn't know because he was distracted with voices!!"** she yelled down at him, berating him from her higher position. **"you and Kasga, and Dex, and Naryen, hell even me! we all need to start working together dammit!"**
She turns from her kneeling position to turn her gaze upon her spirit-sister **"I don't care how much you were taught not to trust Jedi I don't care if you have trust issues, I don't give a a loud of bantha crap if you don't believe in this force! I care about all of us working as a damn team! I was enslaved and tormented by humans! I have yet to attempt to put a knife in your back even thought it was Imperials that tried to kill me and a small child that just lost her damn mother!"** 
**"Get it through your head! we've all had hard lives, all of us! we all have issues and we're all messed up, but that is what will make us great because in every one of us we were taught not to trust anyone else in this group and we can. and for that no one can turn us against eachother except for ourselves. Kasga looks to you Naryen for guidance and orders, if you show distrust he feels it! if you show it, I feel it and so do everyone else."**  She turns back to the hole **"Chase when you preach on about your view of the world to other people that don't understand and weren't taught as you that's all you seem to be, a preacher who just talks and doesn't give a damn."**
**"You both need to learn to work together, if you two can do we can all do it, but you both are the issues here and it's because you're so damn alike I could swear you were separated at birth!"**  She turns to the woman again **"I apologize if you believe yourself an insect and my words before hurt you, but you do look at him like he's something you want to squish and that's not helping us."**
Her gaze softened slightly, her tone lowering a bit **"I think of you as my sister, a real one, something I never had and your human, you look just like those in the 'family' but I trust you because you're different. you aren't like them and you showed that to me when it counted. I don't trust well, I prefer to shoot things, and I know that how Chase and I act around each other bothers you. I'm sure there's more to it and I want to be able to have a long conversation over some hard drinks to figure this out so we are all okay and a good team."**
Pale eyes watch her for a minute **"But I need you to start trusting him. At least start listening, and not with Imperial ears, but the ears of an outcast like the rest of us."** 
She had finished, there wasn't more she could say on this really and the pleading she could hear in her own voice was making her uneasy, she couldn't remember the last time she had shown vulnerability like that.
Clearing her throat she turns to the room **"I know you heard the name too Naryen, whatever it is that's speaking we can hear it too so that must mean that Chase was just more attuned…so…maybe it's in the basement…maybe the floor was a dampener.."**

Dexter was looking at the blaster marks around the window where he was looking. Still trying to make out the voices he was hearing. He thought about asking Chase to come to where he was and see if he could pick up anything living around them other then them. As he was reaching for his comm link when he heard a crash then a voice saying a name that he didn't know. It was aways back to where his friends where and if ran in he might have landed in whatever caused it. Caution was the way to go in this situation.
Using his training he moves as close to the door of the building as he could without giving himself away. Close enough to listen in on what was going on in the room. If was a trap he wasn't going to fall into it. Hand close to his blaster he listens carefully to make sure his friends where alright. He hears Tar'ja he thinks talk about team work or at least the tail end of whatever she was yelling about. Still better to wait and make sure first then decide what to do next.

No, not *a* slap. Several. Hard. Perhaps with a few punches and some screaming. It sure would make her feel better, if for only a moment.
Naryen tried to melt into the wall behind her as a portion of the floor in front of her disappeared taking their left-hand-of-death-chaos-and-destruction with it. It's then she noticed Tar'ja teetering on the edge. ***He's killed himself with his senselessness and he's taking her with him!*** There was an immediate tug-of-war as her bones tried to rip from her and go after Tar'ja while her nerves and skin tried to cling to the wall. She grit her teeth as Tar'ja fought for balance.
Naryen released her now sore face when Tar'ja lowered her center of gravity and started yelling at Chase. What she heard from her purple friend sounded very much in line with what she expressed to him earlier, if a bit more bluntly. She felt a little reassured in that someone else seemed to see what she saw with Chase... all it took was him trying to bring a building down on all their heads.
Just as the sound of the building starting to implode subsided Naryen heard a voice, and a name, just. ***Well, that answered her question of Chase earlier; the roll call was happening now.*** She started looking around her, listening and feeling, for any sign that the rest of the floor or building would follow the example of the section before her. She didn't hear or feel any vibrations and her feet seemed otherwise sound, so she stayed put but did come away from the wall a step.
Then Tar'ja turned to her, with those same eyes as earlier, and started to talk at Naryen ... and Naryen began to feel alone, again, as Tar'ja seemed to categorically miss everything about her one bit at a time. For the second time since Solen dropped them off she stared, shocked, as yet another ally revealed that they didn't know her in spite of her best efforts to open up to them. Her new feeling of security in a bond with another being seemed to evaporate like the apportion is must have been.
As Tar'ja continued Naryen tried her best to follow, perhaps the relationships here could yet be salvaged. Tar'ja seemed to be trying to mediate some conflict between Chase and Naryen. It gave her hope that perhaps she could get through to her, at least. It's a place to start. She tried to pick highlights from Tar'jas sermon, focus on, but it was a tall order.
Why would she be bothered by beings seeking and finding solace in the lives of others? It's always been about people choosing for themselves yet every time she tries to talk to either of them lately it's Imperial this or propaganda that as if they're not subject to the same thing themselves. Even Chase said, during his sermon, that the Empire is the enemy when the Empire is an organization of people, many like Naryen, and all he wants to do is kill them! Was Tar'ja even in the same room/s as Chase time and again exposed them or others to mortal danger by his careless choices? And now it's about her belief in the Force? Is Chases faith so thin he needs others to agree with him?
Some masochistic part of her was glad Chase was at least ok enough so say he was ok. That could be dealt with later.
When Tar'ja finally finished, Naryen said **"Agreed,"** leaving it broad. **"Now, can you please back away from the edge of the collapsing floor a little? More could give way."** She now regretted not taking the demolitions extension course, it may have proven useful in determining the structural integrity of decrepit buildings one could find oneself trapped in.
With projection, **"Chase. Is there anyone down there with you?"**

There it was....in her eyes...she could see it...she'd hurt her again. Why? what did she say wrong this time?? She had thought by going at them both then neither could be upset with each other.
Clearly there was more to this than she understood.
She didn't get it. Social skills were not a forte of hers clearly, and there was more to this than she knew...or..could really comprehend. Time for this later.
And there would be a later time, she promised herself.
Sighing she stands slowly, backing up a few paces, pulling her hood back over her head. Once she was back onto more safe ground she turns to the woman, moving up to her to rest her hands on her shoulders.
"I've..misunderstood again..haven't I." she mumbles softly to her, she knew this would be better served when they were all safe and back on the ship and on their way someplace, but..dammit this was her chance at an actual family like she'd spied on for so long.
"I'm...I'm sorry." she manages to get out, pulling her friend into a hug "i'm trying..I simply don't want you two to keep fighting like this..it's..it's not a team..or a family..is it?"

Tar`ja regains her balance but the floor boards under her feet groan in protest to her weight. Looking down the newly created hole Tar`ja searches for any sign of Chase. Hearing the snap of a glow rod a soft yellow light now illuminates a small area in the center of the hole. She can barely make out Chases form under a small pile of splintered rubble.
“Sola Dol” Another name heard by all, both audibly and through the force for Chase.
Chase looks around the basement seems to extend out further into the ground then the walls above would indicate. Though Chase cannot see the walls in the basement as they extend beyond the glow rods reach he can see the central column beside him. The column itself is tan stone which rests on the basement floor. At the columns base a single metallic shaft extends along the floor and towards the northern area of the basement and continues outside the glow rods reach.
As Tar`ja vents her frustrations the floor creaks and groans as if in response. The floor in this building is very weak, though you cannot tell why. Naryen yells to Tar`ja to move to a safe distance just as another floor board falls inward. The boards beneath the ex-imperial begin to groan and shake, it would seem that the entire floor could give way.
Dexter slyly sneaks up to the buildings doorway with a curious Kasga looking on. The Duro`s shakes his head at the Bothan completes another scan of the area then moves to the doorway without stepping inside. “For the stars” Kasga mutters under his breath, an old spacer song which sings that it is better to die at the throttle then on the dirt like a land lover.
Tar`ja moves back a few steps, each step is meet with the groans and shakes of the floor boards as she moves. Finding herself almost back to the doorway before the shaking stops.
“Bama Osh” everyone hears the new name, just as the last.

He simply laid there on his back looking up at the hole that he created. **"Wonderful Chase. Just wonderful."** He said talking to himself as he saw Tar'ja peering down from the openings edge. **"Way to walk off half-cocked. Why do you let her get to you so?"** Again the question was said to no one but himself as he looked around. The glow rod illuminating the area around him. He looked back to the self created hole as he heard Tar'ja yelling down at him. He heard the words and he couldn't refute them. With a bit of effort he managed to make it to a sitting position as she continued to yell down at him. He was trying to work with them all but the distrust he continually felt from Nayren seemed to be unhinging everything.
It didn't matter if they believed him or not about the Force or what he knew. If only they could at least listen to what he has to say and not immediately dismiss it as some Jedi propaganda he'd be happy. Letting out a sigh he knew he needed to listen to his own words. As much as Nayren was a pain in the ass he was beginning to realize he could also listen better. ***If only her emotions were so easy to pick up on. It like the top of a container was lifted off and its contents were spilled out. If her emotions concerning me weren't so strong it wouldn't be so bad. Question is how do I managed to curb the apathy she has towards me?*** He sighed already knowing the answer as he looked himself over for any major injuries of which he found none besides the wood splinter in his shoulder.
Up above he could hear Tar'ja's voice but it wasn't being directed down the hole so it wasn't to clear for him to pick up on. The emotions up there were strong. It was at that point that he shut them both out and focused on what was down here. From what he could see the area he was in is at least as big as the area above. The center column up above was still beside him. Looking up he couldn't see Tar'ja and assumed that she had backed off from the hole to prevent herself from falling though and joining him.
Standing up he placed a hand on the column for support as he shown the glow rod around in an effort to get a better look. He looked at the metallic shaft as the light made its way across it. The shaft continued on past the range of the light. **"Interesting."** He said as he heard Nayren's voice projected from up above.
Looking up to the hole he yelled up. **"No. Not that I can see now or sense earlier. Though it seems to be a pretty big area down here. Even with the glow rod I can't see the walls. Give me a moment to look around better. Maybe you can figure out a way down."**
Bringing his light around he looked around the column and then to the metallic shaft that extended to the northern area of the basement. Slowly and with a fair amount of pain he began walking as he reached out with the Force.

Kasga was heading for the edges of the floor as the center gave way. He runs for the walls, plastering himself against it and waiting for the shifting to stop. The floor swallowed Chase completely. Heedless of her safety, Tar'Ja almost follows.
The fall seems to stabilize and quiet down. Naryen and Tar'ja and Chase all set up a yelling commentary in and out of the hole. Kasga strides slowly up beside Naryen. Then he hears the names as well. Momentarily confused, he listens carefully forgetting to be concerned for Chase's safety. Surely, I haven't come in touch with the Force. Naaaah, it's a real sound, not just something Chase made up.
Kasga looks down toward the hole. Chase appears to be mobile and capable of yelling. He can't be that hurt.
**"Ya know, Chase, I can hear the names too. Looks like you don't need the Force to hear them. Anybody got some syntherope?"**

Dexter still hiding by the door listens carefully to voices in the building. Satisfied that they are his friends he moves into the door way. "Who dropped the Bantha through the building?" Looking around at the others and the hole in the floor he realizes what might have happened. "I take it the universes is trying to tell Chase something again." Taking the can of liquid cable from his utility belt he tosses it to Kasaga. "It is not Syntharope but it is all I have at the moment." "Is Chase alright?"
Dexter looks around the room a little more taking in all that is around him. Looking over at Naryen and Tar'ja. "Well should we join him down there? Could be something important down there that is important or something will try to kill us again. With our luck I would bet on the latter." Dexter smiles at the last statement. Sense he has hooked up with these guys life has been anything but dull. "Oh, before i forget I was checking a window outside that had a lot of carbon scoring and I heard voices. Not the random names that we have all been hearing. I was going to ask Chase if he had sensed anything else around here that is living becides us."

Naryen nearly colapses with relief at Tar'jas touch. She reached up and held the others hand to her shoulder, grateful for the contact. ***She's here. She's safe.***
With an affectionate squeeze of Tar'jas hand, and a sigh, **"Plenty of misunderstanding to go around, I'm sure. I think it's in our nature as we try to shed the scabs of our past so we can move better into the future."** She stares off a moment as the wisdom of her own words startle her. ***Where the frak did that come from!?*** With a little shake of the head she keys back into her surroundings.
Chases answer ***Took half a building dropped on him for him to pay attention and answer a question!!*** confused her and she wears a combo smirk and slight scowl as she considers it. From what she was told the abilities of a Jedi involved life, the sensing and taking of it. Where are the voices coming from if not from a living being? Naryen adds that to the extensive list of things likely distorted or kept from her entirely. Deep bitterness clears it's throat in the auditorium of her mind.
Kasgas confirmation that he heard the same voices and her was welcome as was his and Dexters offer to join Chase in a more sensible fashion.
Speaking so Chase could hear:**"Chase, I think you should stay away from the rest of the colapsing floor. Better under your feet than over your head, at least until we can look at the perimeter and make sure the rest of the building won't follow on top of you."** Looking around the room she then speaks for the rest to hear, around her. **"Down may not be the best choice, it could further destabilize the building and put others at risk. We need to be cautious and look for a way to get Chase back up, safely."**
***Why does this feel like some sort of trap?***
Naryen became aware that she was still holding Tar'jas hand to her shoulder. She did her best to suppress a sudden blush as she released the others hand and straighted her posture. **"At the moment we're all okay and we must *all* stay that way."** She can't help but glance at the the maw in the floor with bitter annoyance as it becomes a proxy for Chase. Naryen checks her mood by entertaining that beating sense into that beings head may actually work.
***Which means smarten up you careless nerf-brained…*** She focuses on her calm and looks to the others for their feelings and initiative for the next move, now that they know her perspective and what they have to work with.

Kasga catches the can one handed. **"That'll work."**
Leary of the questionable floor, he starts looking around for something to anchor the rope to.

Tar'ja idly watches the emotions play over her friends face, she was certainly an interesting one; the twi'lek was going to have to brush up her social skills...make that learn social skills, so that misunderstandings and communications can be rectified.
The sudden appearance of the bothan actually startled her, her hand tensed on Naryen's shoulder, the other drifting quickly to her blaster but stilled. She frowns. That bothan's going to get shot one day...and likely it'll be her doing it at this rate. At least he had the foresight to bring some form of rope.
The light squeeze to her hand brings her attention back to her friend, a small smile crossing her lips under her hood as she takes a step back to give the other room. they needed a way down, so chase could come up..if there was a basement that far then there must be stairs somewhere.
Her gaze scans the room slowly, doors...odd chairs with hidden staircases..there must be something. She moves away, circling the perimeter slowly **"There must be a staircase if the room below is so large yes? We only need to find it."** If there were stairs then they'd likely be more stable then the rest of the room..that was her hope anyway.
**"Anyone have an idea of where the direction of the voice is coming from? Dex your kind is supposed to have good ears aren't they? that direction is it?"** It must be below ground..they all heard it after chase fell so it must be below

He heard Nayren telling him to be careful. He figured that the others were either trying to figure a way down or a way to get him up. Getting our was definitely a concern but not till he had filled his curiosity about this place. There was more going on here than just peoples names from the past.
**"No rush I think most of the bleeding has stopped."** He yelled up to the others as he reached to his injured shoulder. He didn't feel and protruding wood fragments which was good as the half gash/puncture would seemed to be clear of any thing big. **"We have hours till Solen comes back. Might as well have a look around down here."** He added. **"Besides it's not like anyone has a say about me looking around. At least for the moment. I better make it worth my while."** He said the last to himself as he continued to look around.

Dex looks over at Tar'ja. "Well I really couldn't tell a direction, but the window was a few meters that way." Dex points in the direction he came from. "That is why I was going to ask Chase about it until..." Dex looks at the hole in the floor.
" Can you and Nayren make back to stable footing from there?" Looking at the hole again. "With out joining Chase that is."

Tar'ja was already hugging the wall as she made her way, there had to be a staircase or a ladder, there just had to be! The building would simply not make sense without that and if she knew one thing about buildings it was that they had to make sense or no one could get in.
"Dex, I meant that voice that's spouting off names. Listen for it and try to locate it. It's clearly in here somewhere and my guess is down there." She points to the hole. "Chase! listen to Naryen! either stick to the open hole and use your senses or find the wall and hug that." She glances back to Naryen "that should be save enough right? the floor by the wall should be more stable."

Chase reaches out with the force but still senses nothing except his friends above him.
"Ken Cass."
The jedi begins to look around the cavern starting with the metallic shaft. Following it Chase comes to a tunnel about 20 meters from where he had fallen through the floor. The tunnel 2 meters high by 1 meter wide, continues beyond the glow rods illumination.
"Synyc Starwind"
The floor rumbles under Naryen again but stops as she presses even further against the wall. Under Tar`ja the floor also begins to rumble, following Naryen`s example she presses against the wall. In a splinter of wood the floor gives way under the Twi`lek falls into the darkness below. (6 damage to Tar`ja)

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2011-06-06 09:28:23)

Tar'ja felt it, the rumble, a quick move had her pressing back against the wall. She glanced to the others to see how they were faring, Naryen had the same idea, she was fine so it sh-
"Whoa!" she cries out as the world above suddenly disappeared as she fell through the floor to land hard on her feet only to fall over. She hadn't expected to go through the floor, she hadn't thought to adjust herself for a possible fall and as such couldn't catch herself well enough. She hisses in pain as she rubs at her legs. Oh it hurts...so much.
Groaning she looks up to the hole, rubbing at her neck, she was not going to move until she was certain that nothing was broken. She flexes her muscles, testing her knees and ankles before attempting to stand "I'm okay!" she calls up, tossing the hood of her cloak back over her head, no sense in it now that she was already in the dark.
Another groan as she feels around her belt for a glow road, finding one she snaps it open and holds it out to view the space she'd fallen into.

### **Yogi** (2011-06-08 19:05:03)

Chase walked following the Metallic shaft for about twenty meters. Muffled voices from above intermingled with the Names that he heard though the Force. ***Interesting Maybe this leads outside. Would make an easier access then falling through the floor.*** He thought to himself in jest.
He had turned to go back to the opening he had made to let the others know he may have found a way out till the floor above him began to rumble again. Looking up and ahead of him he saw the Light from above begin to stream through the floor before a rumble like before started. With out warning he saw the floor give way and heard the surprised voice of Tar'ja as he watched her pass through the threshold of the floor.
**"Tar'ja!"** He exclaimed quickening his pace as dread welled within him. He watched as she impacted the floor with more grace than he just moments before. Relief washed over him as she stood as quickly as she fell. The sound of her voice saying she was alright lifted the feeling of dread that had started to lift. It was then that a lesson from master Garet came to mind. ***Fear leads to the Dark Side of the Force.*** It was then he realized that this relationship might be filled with more than the average pitfalls one might encounter. But he also remembered another lesson that sometimes doing something was worth the risk. Seeing here there he knew the risk was worth it.
He saw her own glow rod ignite illuminating the area around where she stood. **"Are you alright?"** Concern and relief was evident in his voice.

Tar'ja shifted towards the sound of Chases voice, offering a weak smile. she was still sore, really sore, oh she was gonna be feeling this for a while. "I'm fine..sore..I'm fairly certain I'm bruised somewhere..but..I don't think anything's broken...I don't feel any blood."
She glances around, glow rod lighting the way "well. at least two pairs of eyes is better than one hm?" she says with a smirk. Shifting from foot to foot, testing her balance, pain, soreness; she drops to a crouch and back up. Sore, there was some pain in her leg but not enough to stop her from moving; she'd get it looked at later.
Nodding to him she looks up "Naryen! We're going to stick to the wall!" she calls out "granted that's not as safe apparently." she says a bit lower, so that chase could hear her. Chuckling she moves off, hand to the wall as a second set of eyes. It would at least help her a little. She kept the glow rod off to the side, as far as she could reach, it would allow her eyes to adjust better so that she could take in more of the room.

He nodded when she said she was alright. **"Good. At least you landed better than I did. Graceful I was not."** He said with a chuckle that caused him to wince slightly. With the addition of her glow rod to his illuminated the area a bit better.
As she tested her condition he reached with his free hand to his injured shoulder. It was still damp but it seemed like most of the bleeding had stopped for the time being. **"Most of my bleeding has stopped which is good. The gash doesn't seem to be too deep. I may not have to do a healing trance to though it would help with the soreness I'm going to feel tomorrow."**
He looked around this area as she yelled up to Nayren. He watched her turn and begin to move looking around. **"Tar'ja. I found a corridor about twenty meters from where I fell though. I'm not sure where it leads to as you fell though just as I was about to yell up saying I found it."** He paused for a second as he looked at her. The lilac colored skin on her face looking darker due to the shadows their glow rods cast about. **"It could be a way for us to get out or for them to come down. Either way I want to look around more. There's something here for me to find. What it is I just don't know."** There was a hint of determination in his voice.

Dex watches as Tar'ja falls through the floor to join Chase at the bottom. Naryen looked as if she want to climb up the flat surface of the wall behind her. Looking over at Naryen. "I would feel a lot better my dear if you where on better footing. Maybe even over hear with me and Kasga." There was concern in Dex's voice. a strange thing for someone how spent a lot of time on his own. "Can you make it back to the door way Naryen?" Looking around at the floor. It was hard telling where it was more secure and where it wasn't. Then he hears Tar'ja yell up to Naryen , she was alright. Not that falling through a floor would do much to a person of Tar'ja's training and abilities.
((OCC: Perception check +9. Can I see places where I could step out to help Naryen back before she joins the others in the basement.))

Tar'ja nodded her head at the words, A corridor would be welcome; they knew first hand that meeting the bottom from the floor above by way of the express route was not pleasant. "Lead on then, faster we find it faster we can get them out of the building and more eyes down here."
She looks around the space, eyes adjusting a bit more to the low light "any ideas where that voice was coming from?" She glances back to him with a smirk "I believe your force voice may be living, or we're all going crazy.....or we're all force people and don't know it." she chuckles once before turning back around, continuing on slowly. Her leg still hurt, it was throbbing and likely would for a while..at least until she found something else to have her mind work on. Hm..
Suddenly having him in front of her leading seemed like an even better plan than before.

### **Yogi** (2011-06-11 10:07:40)

Smiling he nodded his head to the direction he had come from. **"It's not too far this way."** He looked up to the hole she had fallen through. **"Hey It's Chase. I'm with Tar'ja. I found the beginning of a tunnel about twenty meters from where I fell though. Not sure where it leads but maybe its a way out or down if you feel like coming down to join us."** He paused for a moment to think about his location and where the tunnel was. Certain he had a good idea he yelled back up with the best approximation of where it was and which way it was heading.
Another thing stopped him as he started to move away. The combined words form Tar'ja and Nayren had sunk in somewhat. Looking back at the hole he projected his voice up again. **"Nayren one more thing. I'm sorry."** Looking to Tar'ja he gave a simple nod as he began to move.
Slightly behind him he heard Tar'ja's voice talking about the voice and how it must be living. Quickly his head turned. **"You can hear it too? Only with your ears?"** The corner of his mouth turned up into a smile. **"I'm glad someone else is hearing it. Are they all hearing it up there?"** He had to be honest with himself as he was wondering how he was going to make them believe that he was actually hearing the voices of what may be people who had passed on. Though how the voices were here he still had no idea.
Looking back he saw the lovely Twi'lek looking at him and he wondered just what could be going through her mind. Holding out his hand free hand to her he smiled. **"Come on walk beside me. I'll show you the tunnel I found."**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **zerah** (2011-06-11 10:19:45)

Happily did she agree to walk beside him, moving the glow rod from one hand to the other, forgoing the wall in favor of taking his hand; at least they couldn't see them up there, Naryen would have a fit...besides it may not have been as good a distraction but that may have been for the best, she needed to be alert after all.
A faint nod of her head "we can all hear it, but it was a single voice." She frowned "we could hear it right after you fell through, made us all think that perhaps the person was below, and the floor was simply blocking them from being heard by others." She shrugs a shoulder "least that's my theory. Then again with how unstable that floor is I'm not sure that it would have the necessary depth for it to withhold sound like that." She glances to him "what do you think?"

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **galenbd** (2011-06-15 12:03:30)

Blast! There goes another one. Kasga jerks a metal bar from the mass of rubble. He wraps the liquid cable around it, sealing it together while the cable is still sticky. He slides along the wall to the doorway close behind him. He lays the bar down outside the door, standing on it to keep it in place. He extrudes a long length of cable, hoping it's long enough to reach the floor. He wraps a chunk of stone around the end of the rope and cuts it off. He plays the rope out over the edge into the hole.
Kasga triggers his comlink, **"If you go down the tunnel, we may not be able keep in radio contact. It may also collapse, sealing you in. We don't have any digging implements."**

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2011-06-15 23:31:53)

As they began to walk from where Tar'ja fell though he listened as she spoke about the voices. **"I don't know. Makes as good as sense an anything else I guess."** He said as he flashed his glow rod ahead of him to where the metallic shaft was that previously led him to the tunnel. Barely making it several steps his comm link beeps and he hears Kasga's voice come across it. Tensing a little he silently curses to himself as he remembers that the pilots comlink isn't encrypted. ***One would think that one as paranoid as him would think twice before using an unencrypted comlink on an occupied planet.*** Granted it was a short range unit the potential problem was still there. Someone would have heard it and knew that there were people out in the wastes. ***I guess most of us aren't thinking clearly today. Must be this planet.*** He thought
Letting go of Tar'ja's hand he took the few steps back to the new hole and took a calming breath before yelling up. His voice calm and cool as eyes fell on line that had been dropped through the hole. **"Hey. No comlinks, especially unencrypted ones."** He stops for a moment letting his words sink into the pilots head. He yelled up once again. **"Things seem pretty stable down here unlike the floor up there. The tunnel may lead to a way out or to another room. Besides Nayren said to look around and that's what we're doing. Albeit Carefully."**
Moving back to Tar'ja his hand found hers again as he led her to the tunnel.

Tar`ja regains her footing and Chase reaches her the pair decide to begin exploring the cavern alone. Heading for the only tunnel Chase has been able to locate the two start their way towards the entrance.
Suddenly your group hears another crash of splintering floor board. Naryen falls through the floor as well, landing with a thump on the ground below. (8 damage) Dust and darkness choke the imperial women`s breath as well as sight. Two glow rods illuminate a small pocket of the unfinished cavern basement.
"Qyn Roeder."
It takes a few moments to clear the rubble from the metal bar outside, Kasga positions the metal bar using the doorway as a brace. Throwing one end down the Duros feels confident that it will reach the bottom of the basement. As if to answer his com message both Kasga and Dexter hear the unmistakable sound of the speeders buzzing somewhere in the area. Unfortunately you are unable to make out the number of speeders out there.
"Torm Arlos."
Remembering the communications array on the central town building it is very possible they may have the ability to scan the planet for signals. It is also possible for one reason or another they have ended their search for Solen. Your group still has an important rebel to locate, and the some how get off this back water hole of a planet.

Inside the floor is in shambles three large holes replace your three companions who have fallen into the dark cavern below. The building has the one main entrance and two window ledges, the windows and doors long gone. In the middle of the large one room building a stone column extends from the ceiling through the floor. Only the floor boards at the base of the doorway seem to be stable.

He hadn't gone more than several steps before there was another loud sound of wood splintering as another fell through the floor. Going on where the voices and the emotional surprise he felt through the Force he knew who it was. **"Nayren!"** He said to himself as well as Tar'ja as he looked to the newly formed hole that was now letting in a small amount of light. Letting go of Tar'ja's hand he quickly made his way over to her keeping an eye out overhead for any more falling debris. Reaching her side he knelt down casting the light from his glow rod over his friend to see if there was any major damage done from the fall. **"Are you alright?"** He said with a clear concern in his voice.
From up above from the newly formed hole he heard Kasga's voice and his earlier fears about the pilots careless and just plain stupid use of a comlink just raised the stakes for the five of them. He closed his eyes as he shook his head as the pilots words of them climbing the rope up. He took a calming breath as he looked up to the hole so his projected voice could be heard. **"Come up and do what exactly? Practically hide in the open? If those speeders are coming back because of your careless use of a comlink then they know we're here and there will be no place to hide."**
He looked at Nayern who had just fallen through the floor. In the glow rods light his face showed his frustration with the Duros up above. Most of all he wanted to give Nayren an ear full about how her tag along up there may have just royally screwed them over but kept himself in check. His features calmed as he opened his mouth to speak. **"Look I know you just fell through but we have speeders inbound again and if its because of his use of a comlink then they will be looking for us. You need to give him some direction as he's not going to listen to either one of us. "** He said as he motioned between himself and Tar'ja with his thumb.

Tar'ja turned at the crash and the hole, wondering who was it this time. Chase however answered it for her making her not just sigh but rush from his side, rather beside him, and to the other woman kneeling beside her. "Naryen? can you stand?" she asks, glow rod out to help illuminate her form and see what might be bleeding or in pain.
Glancing up to the hole she shakes her head "what good would that do? they may not even really look in these buildings we could explore and they may never know. If there is something here they do not want someone else to know about then so far this is our best chance to find it. I say we continue, and you come down here."

Dexter hopes sank as another of his team mates fell through the floor. Then to make matters worse the universe decided that it wanted to make thing really interesting by having the thugs they hid from earlier return. "Well that tears it." Dexter draws his blaster. "Head down Kasga. If we can get a head of them we maybe able to surprise them else where. Maybe the tunnel comes up under one of the others buildings here." It was a long shot, but it beat the two of them in a open fire fight.
"Go on I will be right behind you don't worry. I got you covered." Dex turns his attention back to the speeders and finds what little cover he can. "Oh and tell Chase when I get the parts and the time I will encrypt our commlinks."
Dex keeps his attention focused between the speeders and his friend. He hoped Kasga would listen and head down the rope. Other wise they where both in trouble.

***"Wake up ya perten soldier!"*** She recalled basic. Her instructor screaming through a projector at her while she was face down in mud. For eons, it was always the mud. Colors and texture may have varied, but somehow drill sergeants always found mud to drop whelps into. Typically face-first. ***"The enemy will not geev you a mani or pedi while yer gettin a facial. Geetup! Move it!"***
She was pretty sure that what they shipped in, special for her, was not actually mud that day. It didn't taste right.
Naryen looked slowly away from her feet, and the floor, and up to Dexter but this time he registered with her. She moved her hand from the wall and towards him, just a little. That's when there was a sharp crack followed but a series of smaller, pathetic, crunching sounds as she found herself floating freely in the air, her expression a rather feeble display of dazed confusion. But that passed in an instant.
Everything proceeded in slow motion around her as she turned through the air surrounded by dry rotted debris and dust. Everything, that is, but her.
Her head snapped to as she took stock of her position and drift, and realized it was very bad. Her legs were out of alignment and she was rotating towards her back. She twisted to one side and she pulled her lower leg towards her to start her upright. Then she saw the large plank turning under her, bringing a maw of sharp splinters to bear on her. Dread swelled as she changed her twist to position her curled leg and arms between her vitals and collection of wooden claws.
One end of the plank hit bottom as she contacted the opposite end. A flash of terror, at being impaled, flashed just as she contacted it - and the plank exploded in a spray of rotten splinters as she rended it end to end with her body. It tore at her like an angry swarm pulling and twisting at her features and clothes. When she hit actual floor she continued her twist, away from hole, to make sure no more floor decided to follow after and onto her.
Rolling up to a ready-squat position she covered her face with one arm as she used her other limbs to stand. Dust flew to her arm and face and she winched away from it. ***"Geetup!"*** Once that passed she stood and walked, with a bit of a stagger, towards the hole and source of light she saw. On the way she spit some dust she imagined as "mud" from her mouth. ***Floor can't fall on me if there's not above me to fall.*** She heard a tangle of voices that she ignored, realizing she was shaking a state of rage at that moment.
Considering the hole she also heard the others trying to decide how to proceed.
Looking up at Kasga and Dexter she volunteered. **"The three of us could catch the one of you then the four catch the last."**

Kasga is satisfied with the plan. He turns to Dexter, **"Right, I'll slide down the rope first. You detach it and we'll try and catch you on the way down."**
Not one to wait around once a decision has been made, Kasga wraps himself around the thin line and slides down.

As Chase looks at Nayren lying on the ground he could feel a rolling torrent of emotions wash over the former Imperial. It was only for a few seconds but the effect was there. Her past had been a hard one. As she came through some guiding words were given to Kasga. Seconds later the form of their pilot could be seen sliding down the rope. **"Good he's on his way down. A fight is the last thing we need right now. If that were to happen there might be no hope to finding Dex's friend."**
He looked up to see Kasga nearing the bottom and then looked back to the hole. **"Dex make sure that you throw down anything else that would look out of place. If they spot anything that's not supposed to be there we'll be found out."** Standing up he offered Nayren a hand up. **"I have an idea about catching Dexter on the way down."** He paused for just a second before continuing. **"I may be able to bring him down with the Force negating the need for him to jump and for us to catch him. The catch is I've never successfully attempted something that heavy before."** He looked back up to the hole. **"Though I have grown stronger and more attuned to my abilities since that last time."**

"Rachel Starwalker."
With the decision made Kasga slides down the rope to the basement floor. Dexter then drops the rope and bar down to the basement floor, it hits the ground with a clang. Before Dexter could decide on the jump or the attuned force Chase has offered he feels his body lifting off the ground slightly, whatever Chase was trying to do it was working.
On the basement floor Chase focuses on the Bothan reaching out through the force to help move his friend to safety. Untrained in form of the force the fledgling jedi strains to concentrate, sweet builds on his brow.
Dexter feeling the support of his friend takes the leap of faith descending into the darkness. Dexter falls through the first 3 meters quickly as Chase focuses on the task at hand. Over the last 6 meters Dexter falls like a leaf on the wind, gently and softely to the ground. The effort of moving such a large object takes its toll on Chase who lets go just as Dexter reaches the floor. Both Bothan and Human fall to the ground.
"Kodai Kahn."
With everyone's light source you can see much of the basement now. Rough stone walls extend throughout the basement, which is barren except for the stone column. The column ends at the floor then extends through the basements only passage. Above your heads the remainder of the rotted floor boards can be seen, it is unclear how anyone would have descended to the basement floor safely.
Following the metallic shaft which extends through the passage you notice the passage walls are reinforced with worked stone of fine craftsmanship. The gray stone seems to extend throughout the passageway. A fine layer of dust on the passageway floor gives evidence that this area has not been visited in some time.
"Ryn yung." Still the names continue both audibly and through the force.

The rope and metal bar, that clanged on the ground, soon followed Kasga through the hole. Looking up he saw Dex at the hole contemplating the jump. Not knowing how close the speeders were Chase decided that the sooner Dex was down with them the better.
Taking a deep breath he raised his arm towards the Bothan and reached out to his friend once again delving into the Force. Through that sense he was able to feel all of the things around him for the Force existed between all things. As Dex began to slightly rise up Chase's face contorts with concentration. Despite the concentration and effort He was putting forth he was not ready for the full weight of the Bothan and he quickly fell the first three meters. Taking a small step towards Dex his arm outstretched fully as a teaching from Master Garet floated to the forefront of his mind. ***Size matters not.*** As Garet's voice sounded in his head his control came together and he caught Dex with the Force and began lowering him the last six meters to the floor.
His recent fall combined with this extraordinary effort was taxing him greatly. If any were to look at him his brow and face had become streaked with sweat as his breath came quicker than normal. As Dex lowered so did Chase's hand guiding him lower. When the Bothan was a foot from the floor the effort had become too much as his hold gave way dropping Dex the rest of the way. His eyes closed as his legs crumpled beneath him and he ended up on his rear, head drooping as he tried to recover from the effort. His breath came to him in gasps as he didn't realize that he was holding his breath.

Tar'ja had been watching silently, taking stock of her spirit-sister attitude with a frown. She knew nothing of the training that imperials went through...hell what any organized form of military went through but whatever it was apparently it pissed her off. The fairly soft landing of Kasga caught her attention just before the sharp sound of the metal hitting the floor.
One less thing to worry about.
Glancing up to the bothan than over to the jedi as he takes on a concentrated look. She watches in fascination as the bothan jumps and simply seems to float as though he weighed no more than a furry leaf on the breeze. Truly this was fascinating, who knew the Jedi could do that! lift people of all things! She glanced to the Jedi to watch him and then back again.
She watched bothan land and glances towards the jedi "how'd you do that?" she questioned but the tall form of the human that was the object of her fascination was gone, looking about she glances down and blinks at him, head tilting curiously as she kneels and watches him.
She frowns at him, eyes narrowing critically letting her mind return to the glimpses she took of the Jedi as he worked before speaking "You are too tense, strength is not in the back it is in the core, don't tense so much next time." Her lekku twitch at his labored breathing and the redness along his face "You should be breathing for all things, nothing comes of holding ones breath. shots should be taken with the heartbeat, and breathing allows for a calm heart." she explains in a tone that was often used for her during her training with that one.
She hadn't been with the family. Outside. 'cousin' she was nicer...somewhat. But that tone was something she remembered well, always able to point out a fault, offering the guidance needed, she was the one that didn't attempt to rectify mistakes with the typical punishments. No...that 'cousin' was better, a good teacher, she remembered all those lessons with fonder memories. 'Cousin' wasn't there during, lived elsewhere, might be nice to attempt seeing her again. She'd pass those tests now.
"How did you do that? you didn't touch him. you were not close to him..." she searches him with her gaze as though she could find what had made him able.

As Kasga slides down the rope and hits bottom. Dex tosses the rope and metal bar down the hole after him. As he moves the jump through the floor to the basement he closes his eyes and prepares for the impact that did not come. Instead he feels himself lifted by some invisible force. He strats to float down ward toward the floor. *"This is….. strange."* He thinks to himself. Then realizes what is happening. Chase was using his power to slow his fall to the floor. Until at least the last foot then he let go and Dex slams into the floor. Rolling over and opening his eyes. "Got to work on those landings." He says as he recovers quickly and gets up.
He was in the basement of the building they had take refuge in. The tunnel had to lead somewhere. Dusting himself off and looking around at the others. "Well that was interesting. I think I shall not like to try that again." He puts away his blaster and pulls out a glow rod. "Shall we be on our way." Dex is all smiles as he is glad he is not hurt and the plan worked.

Naryen smiled as Kasgas resolute behavior, and was about to make what she thought was a witty remark... ***Leave the humor to the Bothan, he's clearly better at it than you.*** Having stepped to one side, to be clear of Kasga, she realized too late that the bar Dexter dropped was going to fall on the other side of the durros. It even sounded funnier, she thought, because the bothan did it. Like a metal chuckle. ***Guess I'm glad that everyone is ok and staying that way.***
She looked to Chase with an expression of genuine intrigue. **"All I've heard about the Force is as a tool for deceit and death. As long as you're confident none on this rock can detect you."** Naryen turns back to face Dexter and Kasga and expects her sarcasm will be lost on Chase even though he just admitted his own limitations. ***"Always expect and plan for superior adversaries. Then overwhelm them."***
She jerked forward, in spite of herself, as Dexter seemed to fall freely. When he slowed down, like the air itself suddenly thickened, Naryen couldn't help but stare in fascination, and a little awe. ***Helped instead of harmed, so far.***
Realizing there was an opportunity slipping away, she turned to Chase and observed intently. Her expression was relaxed, as she was very much interested in this person using the Force and not immediately putting at risk every living creature around him, for a change.
She heard Dexters feet reach the ground and his sentiment for the experience. She let a smooth and genuine smile spread across her face. He was, indeed, just fine. Not once taking her eyes off Chase the entire time, she noted the evident strain it took on him. Valuable information!
**"With control comes restraint, it seems. Good to know."** She puts her hands on her hips and asks, voice pitched to the group. **"Lets find the source of that voice, and get out of sight. Preferably at the same time, if we can."** While Chase recovers she looks to Tar'ja, with a continued expression of gratitude to the universe that she also seems unscathed **"Did you have a chance to find anything?"**

Kasga is skeptical at Chase's suggestion that he can use the Force to do anything useful whatsoever. He watches intently, arms crossed over his chest.
Expecting the Bothan to drop to the floor did not prepare him for the halt, nay, deceleration that occured when Chase "uses the Force." Kasga is more than passingly familiar with gravitational forces and that man just altered it with a thought.
After looking more closely at Chase, the strain evident on his face, Kasga reassesses. Not merely a thougt. Concentration seems required.
After Dexter gets up and the group musters to move on down the tunnel, Kasga returns to the spot where Dexter landed. He looks around carefully, trying to spot some trick. Reaching no conclusion , he follows along with the others as rear guard.

His breath came back to him as he sat there. Questions from Tar'ja assailed him as he heard Dex talking in the background. The tone in her voice about strength and him holding his breath resonated in his mind as he remembered similar words from Master Garet. ***Even though you are gone Master you still find some way to teach me*** He thought as his eyes shifted and he saw that she had knelt down beside him.
Lifting his head he wiped his brow and temples with the sleeve of shirt. **"It had nothing to do with strength of back or the core so to speak. I did it with the Force Tar'ja."** Seeing her confusion and remembering Nayren's quip about the Force being used for deceit and death he decided that a little explanation was in order. Feeling his strength returning he made his way to his feet though before he could speak Nayren once again made sense and suggested that they all move out of sight. With her question to Tar'ja he moved his glow rod and pointed with it towards what he had discovered just minutes ago.
**"Over there I found a tunnel though Tar'ja's falling through the floor stopped me from checking it out."**
Grabbing the metal bar and the rope that was attached to it he began walking to where he had indicated. Looking to Nayren and then on to Tar'ja where his gaze lingered for a moment before going back to watching where he was going. **"I'll try to explain the Force and Nayren despite what you have heard the Force is not a tool for deceit and death and as far as someone detecting me unless there was another Force user in the area we'll be alright."** His tone was calm as he spoke and he hoped that his words would not start another verbal match between them. He didn't want to 'preach' as Nayren had put it earlier. **"The Force, for lack of a better word, is an energy field. Life creates it not death. It's everywhere and surrounds all of us. It's between me and you, the wall, the ceiling. Even between our feet and the floor. Because I can see or sense that energy, that surrounds, us I can use it to affect things around me. Which is how I was able to pull my dropped blaster to me when we were back on Tatooine and lower Dex just moments ago. Though six months ago I would not have been able to do that. I'm gaining more control over my abilities."** He looked to the others. **"What else can I explain."** He asked with sincerity

Tar'ja helped him stand, glancing back to her spirit-sister at her question, shaking her head though Chase answered mostly "You fell through before we had a chance. Seeing you were unharmed was more pressing than a tunnel." she stated simply. Face schooled still within that mask of careful indifference and tone of simple logic. Her lekku twitched, an unconscious signal that she had been concerned, something she wasn't entirely sure how to really show...or hell was it fully was.
Taking off after the other female she listens to the Jedi's explanation, a frown crossing her features. energy field? around them all? Pale blue turn to look at him
"I don't understand. where do you pull your strength from. This use of force, the way one utilizes this must come from some part of the body..what part is the one that controls it." Had to be something. Having no ground section to push from made no sense. One doesn't move from a stop to a run with nothing, the muscles must tense first to push off...even shadow walking was mental and a conscious thought of lightening of the feet.

Her eyes bug, for a moment, as Chase seemed to try to start another sermon, bafflingly. ***Even a drop on his backside wasn't enough. Some egos are more resilient than others, it seems.*** She used a measure of control to not shaker her head in disbelief.
With a quick nod acknowledging Tar'jas comment, Naryen stepped boldly in the direction indicatedby the others body language and their surroundings the likely location of said tunnel. ***Away from the hole and out of sight, scurry like the good prey we are.*** She shuddered a little as she recalled some of the stories she heard about upper officers using military exercises as veils for hunts. Between steps she instead pulled some debris from her hair and attire. She was about to answer him, when Tar'ja volleyed him with questions. Naryen considered if it was the Twi'Leks enamored school-girl voice.
Her expression, not facing anyone fully, was a betrayal of her inner turmoil of disappointment and worry. Her training washed it away as she considered the dangerous implications of such distractions, already evident in the fresh holes in the now ceiling above them. To Chase, she said: **"We can debate the definition of 'tool' another time."**
Lacking the specialty gear used by troopers deployed at night she stepped as far as her adjusting eyes would allow. Stopping, she closed her eyes and took mental and physical inventory, steadying her breath and making sure the parts she was born with and the parts she carried were all where they were supposed to be. She then opened her eyes an looked around to take inventory of her surroundings.

The young Jedi smiled as Tar'ja let loose with several questions. He didn't answer right away as he got his bearings to where he had discovered the tunnel using the Force and eyesight to do so. It didn't matter anyway as Nayren interjected. Though he didn't see her face and her tone was calm he could feel the emotional turmoil within the woman. While she had mastered her sabbac face the emotions the former Imperial ran strong and deep.
***Hmm she probably thought I was preaching again.*** He looked over at The dark haired woman who seemed to be going over her person and equipment.
**"That's a good description of it Nayren And like any tool it's how he person uses it is what matters. And you're right. Even though I was just answering a question this isn't the time. Though, from a leadership position, I would think you of all people would want to know all you can about what I can…"** He paused for a mere second. **"and can't do."** He slightly shrugged his shoulders as he looked at her before turning away to where he wanted to take them.
**"The tunnel is this way."**. He said as he shifted gears and took the lead pointing his glow rod in the direction indicated illuminating the way and reached out with the Force.

"karav Jax."
Still in a little disbelief after Chases display of the force, your group presses on. Moving into the finished gray stone tunnel your group is thankful for the light provided from the glow rods, as darkness surrounds you. Chase pauses a moment, but frowns as he is unable to pick up anything other then the repeating names through the force.
"Leo Garet." Again the name of Chases master is echoed verbally and through the force, which weighs heavily in the jedi`s mind.
Moving further into the tunnel the tunnel continues straight ahead. About 40 meters in you notice a soft glow further into the tunnel. Stopping your group can hear the faint sound of running water. The air itself also seems cool and fresh as if you have stepped outside the arid zone outside.
Proceeding towards the source of these changes the tunnel opens into a wide and deep room. Still worked of gray stone the room opens into a circular room about 60 meters in diameter. From the tunnel entrance the floor extends another 2 meters to a stone balcony overlooking the center of the room 2 floors down.The ceiling is held up by stone columns which circle the balcony and extend from the floor to the ceiling. The columns are similar to that in the basement you entered through.
The metal shaft runs up the wall and out to the center of the ceiling and into a large white dome attached to the center of the ceiling. The dome itself is the light source illuminating the entire room.
Throughout the room various plants grow and over grow some areas of the room and floor. Many plant and fruit baring vegetation can be found including many plant species you have never seen before. The whole area is a canvas of life and energy.
Water flows down the stone columns, water falling in a few areas of the balcony onto the floor below. Small pools of water have formed below, mixed with the overgrown vegetation you are unable to see what the floor is made of. The small pools all flow into small trickling rivers which meet into a larger pool at the center of the floor. Above the center pool is a column of light that reaches to the dome above. Floating in circular flight within the light are 14 purple moth like creatures.
"Cale Siman."

Tar'ja continues along the path, hand to the wall to help as a guide, the voice was getting stronger wasn't it? maybe that was just her imagination...but..wait...
"water?"
she asks, confusion in her eyes as she pushes onward to walk beside the jedi, eager to see just what they'd found.
And oh but what they found. She would be the first to admit that she tended to not gravitate too much towards the pretty things in life, they simply weren't practical, but she could admire beauty.
"Beautiful..." she murmurs softly looking over the plants and water, but her attention was drawn towards the sound of the voice and the...what in the hell were those things? Her head tilts to the side, a frown crossing her lips.
"I have..never seen bugs like that before.." winged...wasn't there something like that in a book? what was it called.....

As Chase crossed the threshold into the large circular room he opened up his senses to the Force and he could feel all the life that was within the room. It was simply a beauty to behold. Not only to the eyes but through the Force as well. Life was teaming within these walls and a feeling of calm fell over him as a genuine smile crossed is features.
He came to a stop several paces into the room and looked around. Next to him he heard Tar'ja say how beautiful it all was. **"Yes it is."** He said still taking in the sight not not only with his eyes but with the Force as well. **"I just wish you all could see it as I do."**
Taking steps towards the pool he looked it over as the light rise to the dome overhead. Catching his interest were fourteen creatures that resembled moths.
"Cale Siman."
Once again a name repeated like before. Though this time he realized that it was one he had heard before as were several of the others before that. Running through the names he cocked his head to the side. Looking to the side he looked to Tar'ja and then to the others as he pointed to the pool and the light rising up to the dome. **"Fourteen creatures are within that light. How many names have we heard. Has it been that many?"** Realization seemed to dawn on him as he looked back to the flying creatures. **"Fourteen names, fourteen creatures."** He stated as he walked around the edge of the pool keeping his eyes senses open for anything else that would stand out.

Tar'ja followed after him quickly, snagging at his arm with a faint reproaching glare "Lets not touch things again without checking first yes?" She let his arm go only when she was certain her wasn't about to do something..like touch the light that could kill him for all they knew, or attempt to touch the bugs that might eat him.
Moving around the light she frowns, it looked safe..."you think the bugs have something to do with the names? why? as far as I knew bugs couldn't speak." She glances around her before taking her glow stick, using an end she touches at the light testing; in her mind she was far more dispensable than the others, and more likely to take a hit better.
One was better off not attempting to figure out her line of thought.

Dex walks with the other through the tunnel to the large open room. He saw something that he had not expected to see on this dry planet. An oasis. "This is the last thing I expected to see here, but explains a lot." Looking around at the room. "It must have been part of an indoor garden or something." Dex was truly amazed then he saw the purple moths. "Now there is something you don't see everyday."
Dex barely noticed Chase moving around the room followed by Tar'ja . He though this place must have some meaning to Chase. Whatever it was it was beyond him. Computers, Engines and Tech where things that Dex understood, the Force that was something else all together. That was for the best. "It is hard to believe that someone on this planet does not know about this place. Our friend that brought us here had to have found it at some point. It just seem strange is all." Dex looks around the round not really moving from where he was standing just looking.

Hearing Dex voice his thoughts about Solen knowing about this place made the young Jedi look the Bothans way for a second before turning back to the pool and the surrounding area. **"I'm not so sure Dex. You saw the amount of dust on the floor down here. It wasn't till we fell through that we voided the floor above that protected it from the outside. If it had been disturbed we would have seen the foot prints left by others. I don't think anyone has been down here in many many years."**
As he spoke Tar'ja was quick to his side with advice to not touch anything. Looking at her he flashed a smile at the Twi'lek woman whom he had developed feelings for. **"I won't Tar'ja. I'll be careful."** his right hand came up and laid atop her hand that held his arm protectively. After giving it a quick squeeze he felt the slender hand withdraw.
A few more steps brought forth another question from the lilac colored beauty about his assumption, the voices and the moths.
Stopping he peered at the group of moths. **"Your right bugs can't speak and they aren't. The voice is the same one for all the names and it's repeating them now. The fact that there are fourteen of each shows a correlation."**
He turned to look at her and the others. **"The voice I believe is coming from the Force. While you hear it with your ears I hear it through the Force."**. Seein the look on her face he smiled. **"I know it's hard to understand."**

Chase looks at Kasga as the pilot speaks up. The young Jedi didn't have an answer for him. In a simple gesture he simply shrugged. **"I don't know. I could speculate more but I've never come across anything like this and Garet never spoke to me about this or this planet. This is all new to me."**
He wished he had more to go on but he didn't.

Naryen feels somewhat stunned at Chases interpretation of her comment, though she is starting to become accustomed to his views. ***Does he think I believe all I've been told? My life work has been a lie and he's been there to see it and that is what he says to me?***
The swirl of irritated rage threatened her new calm as Chases juvenile snipe about his opinion on leadership prods her further. ***Now a need for the last word? Truly?*** She opened her mouth to respond to him, then realization returned her calm. ***Every time I speak he sermons in reply, and usually disconnected from the discourse at hand unless it's brazzenly obvious to even a casual spectator. Why must he bait for confronations?*** She didn't respond to his baiting snipe but did consider things further.
Worry increases in her for her Twi'lek companion. ***It can't all be for chasing head-tail, is it?*** She thinks on how his short-sighted behaviour is consistant with a brain damaged teenager suffering from a glandular disorder and other imbalances to difuse her own anger. It was an effective salve on her wound of her lost culture that Chase seems to feel fit to dance on.
Then the glow fron the tunnel proves to be ample distration from the moody child-man. The air is noticeably different. Instead of a feeling of her life being taken with every breath, as in the air outside, this air seems to share and even restore life. Stepping onto a balcony the sights expland on that point of view many fold. Every sense is engaged, the sound of cascading water into a pool and of mist striking leaves. The stone of the wall and colors of the plants carressed by the light. And the smell, a smell that declares plainly "Alive." The contrast is striking.
She thinks of home, painfully, and closes her eyes to sooth that bitter mote. She hadn't realized that she had tilted her head back until she opened her eyes and found herself... counting inectia?
Naryen blinked out of her reverie, ***What is it with purple these days?*** something here felt... wrong.
Tuning into the conversations around her then tries to be direct, while she sorts her feelings, and faces Chase. **"Beings deprived of a sense find those remaining to be sharpened, heightened. With you Chase, you have demonstrated that relying on an additional sense diminishes others. Based on your behaviour in the other room I'd say you've lost your senses completely. I wish *you* could see this room as *we* can. Though I'd settle for some more common sense."**
Pausing for a moment she turns to one side and offers an aside **"Just because we came here as we did doesn't mean there isn't another way down here and it's arrogant to think otherwise. Your point of view isn't all there is."** She scowls as the feeling deepens to the point that she speaks her mind **"There's something *wrong* here."**
Her eyes widen as it begins to dawns on her, and her eyes snap to Chases, **"You felt compelled to come here. Hearing the name of your killed mentor, you felt drawn to this place."**
Her expression hardened with her eyes.
**"The perfect bait to lost trainees seeking guidance."**
She softens her expression, moving it to inquisitive as she seeks Chases opinion in his expressions, then to Dex and Kasga and finally Tar'ja. In her direction but still for the group. **"I'm not an expert in hunting young and inexperienced Jedi but it worked well on him, wouldn't you say?"** thumbing in Chases direction.
Her worm of dread started to stir and grow as she looked around for a dissenting opinion, wanting desperately for this oasis to be a true reprieve, even if only for a moment.

Turning slightly at the sound of Nayren's voice he faced the woman who has been at odds with him since the beginning. He was beginning to think that there would never be a common ground between them. Sooner or later something was going to happen to split this team for good. As she continued to speak he noticed the continued jabs at him and he wondered if the others saw it as well.
It was the coincidence of what she was suggesting that it was a trap laid for Jedi that just seemed to outlandish to be possible. ***Why put this place here in this back water planet where no one come to or even wants to come to. It's too far out to make any sense.***
When she finished he simply smiled. It was a stark contrast to the hardened expression that she wore. **"Now who's lecturing or as you said previously, preaching?"** He paused for a moment as he shook his head at the shear hard hardheadedness they were both showing. **"And if that's what I truly sound like then I apologize to you and everyone else. We're all adults here no one needs to be talked to like that."** He said with an honest tone.
He turned slightly to the balcony. From his vantage point several feet from the edge he could see the foliage and the other life that was below them. It was a beautiful place on a world where beauty was almost impossible to come by. And yet because its here others think its a trap laid out him and others like him.
**"I never said there isn't another way down here. Only a fool would think that and believe that his or her point of view is the only one. What I said to Dex was that no one had been down here in a very long time. You're changing my words to suit your needs to make me look the fool or to try and discredit me in front of the others which is exactly what the Empire has done to the Jedi for the last twenty plus years."**
He stopped for a moment an simply stood there looking at the other four. **"And yes I felt drawn to this place, I still do. It's obvious and there's no denying it. The *Light* side of the Force is strong here. It's one of the strongest presences I've ever felt and in addition to that I do not feel the slightest taint of the *Dark*side here. If I had I would have told you all and preceded with more caution because if this is a trap it's one of the best I have ever seen. Why put a place like this, one that no one even knows exists, on a planet that no one would have any reason to come to? That doesn't make any sense. Does it make sense to you? Any of you?"**
He shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the others and then finally back to Nayren as a realization finally came to him as he sighed as his expression softened. **"Nayren think what you will. Believe that there is something wrong here. It's becoming clear to me that you will never believe or take stock in what I have to say or know simply because of the tradition that I follow and what you were taught about Jedi. If I had been taught the same things about Imperials that you were taught about Jedi then we wouldn't be having this conversation right now as one of us would be dead. I've come to trust you as have the others. Is it that hard to trust me? Is it even possible?"**

Tar'ja frowns at the pair of them, sighing. Fine then.
Moving away from the light she had been testing she grumbles and begins to check the flora and the ground for footprints from her perch on the balcony; that would be one way to shut them both up and stop bickering.
"Enough, both of you. I hate Imperials, and I don't give a damn about Jedi." she nods her head towards the others "You two have no love of Imperials either I'd wager concidering the shit we'd been through, not to mention the idea that someone can do things and see things that make no logical sense to the way that we know of it." She states in a tone befitting of one that was tired, annoyed, and indifferent.
"Sensing the world with a sense that isn't one of the ones everyone is born with, ridiculous. That would be like a crew using sensors to view things in a place that would surely kill them if they were to attempt it themselves." Sensor readings in deep space, a tool and useful but explain that to a race that has not achieved space travel yet and they'd simply think a person insane..likely kill them.
"This place could be a trap." she states "then again I have never seen a trap this beautiful, with strange flying insects that speak, with fresh water that doesn't appear to be poisonous, with a feeling of safety that's only ever come up in a ship, in space, hidden away." she states, circling the small area, crouching here and there to examine the ground as she walks "The logic of someone placing this elaborate place as a trap for Jedi of all creatures on a world where the people are more interested in finding food and earning credits to keep the imperials away than pretty flowers and bugs and a sense they don't have."
She pauses and looks over to the pair "I've said it before, and I'll state it again, I don't care if you like each other, but you have to stop fighting." she motions to them both "You aren't helping anyone by being at odds."

Tar'ja's voice cutting through the silence brought his head around quickly to where she was standing off to the side. He closed his eyes and as he head began to slip hanging low. The back and forth was tiresome and he had had enough of it. He didn't want to do this with Nayren anymore. It was compromising the cohesiveness of their group and if it continued they would fail the mission before they even found Dex's friend.
**"I'm sorry Tar'ja. I don't want to fight amongst ourselves. I'm asked questions and I try to answer to the best of my ability which apparently I do poorly."** Feeling at a loss he backs up a couple of steps to lean against the stone balcony that separated them from the beautiful scene two floors below them. His gaze fell to the ground ahead of him before lifting hit back to Tar'ja. **"I can't ask any of you to understand the Force and how I can use it to see and affect the world and what is in it. It's like trying to explain love to someone who has never felt the immense joy and or profound sadness it can bring to a person. Just as I can't understand the experiences any of you have gone through. I can empathize and and show support but in all honesty I'll never truly know."**
Bringing up a hand he ran it along the top of the balcony and felt the hard stone under his fingers and palm. **"I've heard and seen vids of the vast forests of Ithor yet I have never been there and actually laid eyes upon them. Does that mean that they don't exist? Sometimes I just have to believe what I can't see till it proven otherwise. It may be a slightly naive angle but I prefer that to the alternative. A galaxy full of negativity and doubt."** He looked at them all encompassing they in his view. **"But this is only my view based on my experiences of which I readily admit is not all encompasing."**
He looked at Tar'ja and then back to Nayren. **"I don't know what else I can say."**

Kasga just shakes his head during the whole confrontation between Naryen and Chase. All this yammering over a staircase. He was asking for it. He’s acting like he knows what the Force is, but can’t really explain it to anyone who’s not already part of that ancient priesthood.
Give me real hardware any day. At least with a multi-tester, I can tell you what it’s doing even if I don’t have a schematic. What a pain in the choobies.
Aloud, he merely comments, **”This place makes me uncomfortable. Let’s try and find a way out. After all, we still have a mission to accomplish.”**

"Well I am out of my element here, and am willing to bow to Chase for what all this is. If this is a trap I believe he will warn us." Dex was lost. All this talk of the force and talking bugs was something he had no idea about. He walks up Naryen. "My lady. Maybe we can explore some of this area while Chase does his thing." Looking to Chase puzzled. "Whatever that may be. There has to be some way past this and maybe we can find it." He had heard the conflict between the two and it was not helping. Tar'ja always the protector was trying her best to keep the two from fighting. Considering the fear she put into him she was the best buffer you could ask for.
Turning back to Chase. "And yes I agree. If Solen had known of this place it would most likely be pick clean by now." Jestering to Naryen to help him explore. Dex puts on his best "Some battles are best fought at another time" look and hopes she understands. "Kasga. We will head this and you check that way and we will try figure what this place is. Or at the very least find away to continue on our way if needs be." The spy was sure between everyone here that they figure it out. At least he was hoping they could.

<strong>&#8230; Kerzarp goes the bug thing ..</strong>**.**
Naryen stared as Chase, again, categorically ignored every point of import she expressed and selectively addressed the mundane ones. Her mood depressed as she realized that she had been baited, again, into his juvenile righteousness argument. Then the things he said registered after they had rolled around against her senses for a moment as her failure of her communication gnawed at her. ***That places could be imprinted with intent by those that build them makes sense to me but that wasn't my point. Someone else could re-purpose it as a trap or bait for exactly that reason!*** She had tried to communicate with Chase and failed.
She felt mentally exhausted. It would be another point that she would fail to convey, so she just stayed quiet. Every time she tried she failed, even with Tar'ja. Of all people. That six limbed purple assassin was there when her world was ended by those with greed for power yet still Naryen faced barricades. Perhaps they were obstacles from others, perhaps they were from herself, she was too weary to think of that now. To Naryen it sounded like she thought she was picking a fight with Chase as much as it seemed he was with her. Another failure.
Perhaps it was naive of her to think that she could use her Imperial training against the Empire. She hadn't realized the extent of the stigma she would encounter. Tomas found a place but she still struggled. A feeling of failure filled her as her shoulders slumped slightly and her eyes fell. It was the first time since her first days of basic that she did that. It hurt in so many ways. ***"Failure makes way for success though they seldom coordinate their schedules."*** The memory was only a small consolation.
Naryen sighed inwardly as Kasga and Dexter voiced reason and direction that she could only to agree to.
She nodded at Kasga and Dexter in turn as they spoke. **"I'll watch the way we came in."** She said meekly. Some idle part of her mind didn't recognize her own voice.
Naryen walked, dejected, around Chase to the tunnel-way, drawing her weapon as she did. Listening and yelling a warning should be easy enough.
She stood to the side, her head tilted to the opening and calmed her senses so she could listen, filtering the many sources of noise around and within her.

"Ram Parsa."
"Sola Dol."
"Bama Osh." The names continues as you all stare for a moment in awe over the sight before you. So completely out of place on the backwater med rim world.
The Moth like insects continue their circular float inside the pillar of light, each leaving a slight purple glow of disturbance within the light. The purple have dissipates quickly behind the insects creating an almost purple tail of light. Chase`s thinks back to the names already repeated an the moths in the room there does seem to be a correlation between the two, also as the moth`s reach the mid way point a name is spoken and a moth dives downward only to begin its circular flight again.
Looking around the area, the balcony you are on circles the room, though some over growth of plant life blocks some of the railing and passageway. Below you the second floor seems similar except much more over grown with vegitation. From here you see no stair way no access points, they could be blocked by vegetation. The bottom floor 3 flights down is completely over grown with plant life and small pools of water, even a small cluster of trees. The whole seen rivals even some of the stories of Ithorian gardens on their large herd ships.
"Ken Cass."
Looking around the area at least on the upper balcony might lead to a way down. The diameter of the room is 60 meters, which gives a lot of room along the balcony to hide passage ways and stair wells behind plant growth.

Chase stod there leaning against the stone wall that was in place to keep them from falling off balcony. He looked to the others as they spoke gleaming a sense of emotion as they did. He nodded in thanks to Dexter as he spoke in support of him. Yet despite the support shown he was still feeling terrble about the divided mess the group was in.
He took a breath and slowly let it out. He had severly lost his focus in the last several moments. It was something that he knew Master Garet would have admonished quickly if he had witnessed or felt through the Force.
The Force, could he ever explain it enough for them to understand? Looking over his shoulder down to the floor below he raised his eyebrows. At the beginning of their journey he believed that he could. Now he wasn't so sure.
Movement from Nayren caught his eye as she then moved infront of him to stand watch behind them. He could feel the emotions coming from her and he silently chastised himself. He tried to muster a smile but felt like it failed. ***"I don't want to fight with her but stang why is it so easy to?***. He thought.
Looking the opposite way that Dex had indicated he was going to search. He straightened up and had pointed his glow rod in that direction. He began to walk and looked at Nayren as he took two steps and came to a stop. Shifting direction he walked to her as she looked back the way they had came. **"Nayren."** He said quietly. **"I'm sorry. I don't want to be at odds with you. It's obvious we see and look at things differently, very differently even. Yet that doesn't make either one of us wrong. I'm glad you are here and a strong voice in this team."** The look on his face and inflection in his voice was one of honesty in that he meant what he said.
Tentatively he brought up his free hand and gently laid it on her shoulder where he gave her what he hoped was a comforting squeeze.
Not sure of what else to say he removed his hand and walked in the opposite direction of Dex and Kasga. He looked at Tar'ja and gave her a small smile then back to the front. Calmer now he looked out before him and reached out with the Force and his eyes to see if they could find a way up or down to the lower level.

Kasga moves off and away from the others, but ends up next to the balcony nevertheless. An idea seizes him. He walks back to where they came down and quietly gathers up the cable he had made before. Returning to the balcony, he starts looking around for a location secure enough to climb down from.

<strong>&#8230; Kerzarp goes the bug thing ..</strong>**.**
She half kneeling, half crouched and leaning a little against the wall next to where they came into this wondrous place. There, with one ear to the tunnel and out of sight from it and the other to the richness of their discovery. She sat with attention divided between the way they came, a possible source of danger, and where they ended up, a place almost forceful in its tranquility. Demanding relaxation like a force impressing upon her.
It was not unwanted.
Naryan closed her eyes and calmed her breathing. She allowed her attention to drift between the two paradigms until it filled both of them. In her mind she set one against the other. Danger from the tunnel would clash greatly with the sense of safety from the room so each was reinforced. In her relaxed state she was aware and ready.
A small smile showed on her face as an expression of calm intensity revealed itself on her fatigued features. She allowed a moment of pride in her trick of the mind, accomplishing in record time something she used to struggle with. Finding the resonance in paradox was something she relished though she seldom got to truly enjoy it. Tuning out the others while they went about their business would be a welcome reprieve, for the time being.
Having only just achieved her moment of focus Naryen wasn't aware of Chases approach until he spoke. His suddenness upon her senses was jarring and it was all she could not to shoot upright or gasp for breath. With a slight shudder in her breath she waited patiently as he had his say, again. From her prior experience with him he seemed to feel a drive to have the last word so she thought better of speaking and tried to return to the mental place she had found earlier.
Then he touched her shoulder.
Her hand turned from her side and headed for its opposite shoulder like a dashing hero, from some holo-novel that would seem wildly brilliant to juvenile minds, rescuing the helpless conquest. She, again, exerted a measure of control to *not* twist his hand from her in a defensive joint lock.
Apparently satisfied that he had had his say he released her and walked away, likely shaking his head again. She wondered at his need to invade her personal and mental space so often. A depth of violation only a Jedi could achieve, it seems.
She brought herself back to her previous state, though this time a struggle to obtain and it needed maintenance. Like broken pottery poorly mended, not quite the same as before. She sighed a little as she cleared her mind and slowly brought herself back to a place of balance and waited for something else to challenge it.
This time she would shoot it.

"Synyc Starwind."
Chase reaches out with the force, eyes closed the Jedi try`s to maintain focus. "Synyc Starwind." The voices continue within his mind almost soothing to hear but distracting him from his goal. A more practiced Jedi would have been able to block out the names. Chase continues to concentrate on his goal.
Just below you the top of two trees stand motionless in the absences of a breeze. Water continues to trickle down the twin balcony floors and on to the ground floor.
Your group hears a slight chip then another, small feathered multi colored avian creatures flock about from tree to tree. This hidden oasis must be lush indeed if it can support life beyond plant life.
Kasga moves away from the group a few meters resting at the balcony view. This area is large, the Duros can see how two space transports could easily land within, the bottom floor would have room to spare to service the ships as well.
"Qyn Roeder."
Chase continues to concentrate attempting to ignore the names. "Qyn Roeder." Then the young jedi remembers a early lesson, "not everything is as it seems, much of what can be used to distract one can be used to focus as well." It was an early lesson something young-lings where told when they began focusing practices but it was accurate. Chase begins to use the names as pulses timing them with his feelings and reaching out in between the pulses. To the right Chase can sense more plant life, it seems to be coming from within the walls and to the left Chase can sense calmness, peace of mind and body.

Tar'ja was glad for the lull in argument and heated words, glad for the sense of peace the living place brought.
The gladness was starting to make her stomach roll. How did people live with so much glad and happy feelings?? ugh she wanted to tear her skin off or something.
She repressed the urge to snarl or grunt at the space, something to disrupt things. Sure it was nice and all and she kinda liked the plethora of plants, but the weird talking bugs, the tension and the overall idea that this really could be a trap-brought on by her dear soul sisters insistence-was making her mind repress the peace in favor of chaos to find her own tranquility.
Really no one understood peace as much as a hunter or a night walker...an assassin too, that calm that came when the life left a victims eyes, the ability to pass unseen when the entire area is searching in the chaos; that was peace, tranquility, to be invisible in a crowd.
Her thoughts had her stopping glancing back to the others, she wondered if they would understand how much she enjoyed chaos, how much she reveled in adrenaline, of stealing off a person, of-no...careful, that thought always brings a smile and that might make them wary; things are still too new.
Shaking her thoughts and returning to her own idea of peace her gaze tracks the floor, the railing, the floor far below; look for the obvious, a good trap is hidden within the obvious; knowing a thief would get past part but fall into the second without ever knowing it was there, that was a good trap...now...focus on the obvious, let observation reveal the tricks, and go slow..plenty of time.
She moves to a railing, testing the weight by pushing against it, on it, if it could hold her she could scale it for a better view below before she moved too far.

The flash of irritation he though he felt from Nayren left him thinking inwardly as he walked away. Once again he had made an effort with the woman and once again he felt like nothing was accomplished simply because of who he was and what ever else he had done to further Make her seen him as an enemy.
He tried to empty his mind but found that he was having trouble doing so. ***Maybe not an enemy. That term is a bit harsh. Adversary? Possible. It almost seems clear that she will never change her attitude towards me. How many times can I put forth the effort to quell the tension in an attempt to set her feelings about me and the Jedi at ease? How many times before I finally say to hell with her and find my own path with out her and or the team? Regardless of relationships that have started.*** Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a lilac form moving.
The thought was a surprising one though it shouldn't have been. ***Sometimes people just didn't get along but that's just it, we did at first. It was when I killed the Gran merc in the cantina that it seemed to change. Almost as if when I used my lightsaber and solidly confirmed the tradition that I followed was that it flicked a switch within her. If her indoctrination is that strong there may be no hope of this working out.*** He looked over at Tar'ja who was going through her own motions to find a way down or up. ***I should talk with Tar'ja when I get a chance. Perhaps she can shed some light on this mess.***
His concentration wasn't there. Ignoring the names seemed to bring him into focus but something was missing or further distracting him. As he walked further away from the others he heard another name and let it register slightly.
Reaching out again with the Force he was able to sense more of the plant life. As another name sounded out he used it to focus. Not so much focus on the name itself but in the time between the ticking off of names. Again he was rewarded with sensing more plant life from within the walls to the left.
Now that he had found the calmness he was trying to achieve earlier he felt more at ease with himself and the others.
Moving to the left eyes open to the surroundings and his being to the Force he felt a sense of calmness and a peace of mind an body that he hadn't felt in many, many months. Altering his course he continued to move in the direction of that calmness. All of his earlier thought just moments ago were put to the side as he sought to continue the peacefulness he had found. Coming along side the wall where it felt the strongest he left his hands run themselves over the surface as his presence in the Force extended to the wall and what was behind it. Maybe there was something here to find.

Dex walked around the area that he thought was clear and open he would check that over before heading into the jungle for the look of it. He could not really under why Nayren did not at least try to work with Chase. They where in this together and she at the very least could keep her comments about Jedi to herself. Dex had learned to take whatever information he could get a hold of an use it to it's fullest. This of course lead to problems sometimes when he had to buy or steal that info he needed. As he walked and looked at the plant life. The fruit trees and flowers it was all breath taking. All of this on a planet that look used up and tossed a side. *"I wonder if any of this is eatable."* He thought to hiumself. It had been awhile sense he had had fresh fruit.
He starts to wonder into the thicker parts of the under ground jungle looking for anything that might shed some light on what was happening. He of course realizes that this could be folly, but it beat setting on his hands as it where.

<strong>&#8230; black and twitching on the ground &#8230;</strong>**.**
Now that Naryen was more tuned into her surroundings she quickly realized the change in the group. Everyone was going about their business. Part of reason for this was clear: Because she was guarding the entrance the others had the security to look around, and each was. The other part didn't settle well with her.
She didn't try talking with Chase. She just let him roll over her with his mental and physical groping.
***Will I need to let him violate my personal space just to keep the peace?*** She drew an uncomfortable parallel. ***Will my dissenting opinion need to be silenced for the greater good? Must I go back that Imperial way just for this group to function?*** She recalled how things looked from within, then without, the Imperial military structure. How dissenting opinions were silenced using tactics that let good men and women die just because they didn't follow the propaganda close enough. She managed to avoid it, then, thinking that they were traitors and she didn't have enough information. Now she knew that she was very lucky to have survived.
Chase couldn't possibly need her to bend to his will... could he? She thought of how Tar'ja had been acting and put the thought aside vowing to return to it later. She smiled a little as she recalled the monologue from Tar'ja to Chase showing that they did still have a common ground. Best to visit it later. There was a job to do.
She smiled a little as considered Kasgas attention to the assignment and did her part as the good little soldier. Watching their flanks. She looked around the room a little, taking stock of each person and what they were doing, all the while keeping her ears focused on the way they came in, and ready.

Kasga looks around and finds a likely pair of railing supports. He tucks the iron bar between them and anchors it in place. Slinging his leg over the railing, he starts shinnying down it to the floor below.

"Shamara Darmal."
Tar`ja moves to the railing pushing some weight against it, then some more. The stone railing does not give against the Twi`leks force. Scanning the area the second floor has even more plant life then the third floor, many more places for something to hide. Shadows play across the second floors walls only adding to the mystery.
"Rachel Starwalker."
Chase moves to the left following the curved balcony in pursuit of his feelings. Making his way past a large berry filled bush the jedi sees a large five meter wide access way. Inside a large room that seems to branch off into four smaller rooms one on the east another the west wall and two more on the north wall of the room. Stone archways provide entrance into the rooms all of which are barren with the exception of the large stone statue in the main room.
The ten meter high statue despite a robbed figure head bowed in prayer. The modest robes conceal much of the figure except a light saber at its side. The jedi temples of old contained many similar statues within and outside them.
"Kodai Kahn."
The stone railings make an excellent anchor for kasga`s makeshift grapple. The grapple and railing easily support the Duro`s weight as he tests it one more time before repelling down from the third floor. Mid way between the third and second floor the pilot notices much more foliage on the second floor and a few rooms along the wall of the second floor. The rooms seem to be spaced evenly along the wall, looking down the length of the second floor balcony many more rooms could be easily concealed by the plant life.
"Ryn Yung."

Tar'ja glances over to the Duro making his way down, she hums faintly and moves to the rope waiting for the other to land safely on whatever floor he was taking before following after to the second floor, she wanted to know what was in those rooms and this was the best way...safe climbing down the railing and jumping...
Rope was a much better idea.

<strong>&#8230; sizzle &#8230;</strong>**.**
Naryen witnessed, in further irritation, as Dexter and Chase went mentally separate ways with the Jedi, again, forgoing his other senses favoring only one. Much like a toddler-boy discovering a new body part.
She was glad that Tar'ja and Kasga were staying together. The two more sensible would likely survive together but she wished that Kasga would have stayed with Chase and Dexter with Tar'ja. That seemed to be the pairing with the least chance of anyone dying outright.
***Though with that careless child anything could happen.*** She buried that thought as she imagined the Jedi juggernaut of chaos cleaving through each of them in turn with his energy sword just because they were an inconvenience, like the Gran he executed in front of her. She further imagined that he'd end with her just so she can see the others fall despite her best efforts to save them as a final insult.
No, that was wrong. She was imbuing him with intent she was actually confident was beyond him. He was simply dangerously reckless, careless and arrogant. The next thought was a surprise: ***He's much like Imperial officers I've known!***
She chuckled as she refocused her efforts on the way they came in and looking for other threats around her. She had never thought she had all the answers, quite the opposite. Naryen had spent her whole life looking for the perspectives other than her own.
They hadn't even thought to decide on how she'd let them know they were compromised. ***Frak!***

Kasga clambers down to the second floor such as it is. The plants have so overgrown the floor, he has to make his landing carefully to keep from injuring himself. Like landing on an asteroid. 
He climbs slowly around to one of the tunnels leading back into a room and waits for Tar'ja to catch up. After all, he still has no glowrod.

Dexter tries pushing way into the plant life to see what he could find other then more plants and flowers. After not finding much other than aggravation he move out back to the clearing that he started in. Straightens himself out again and decides that he could be of use else where.
He walks over to where Naryen was keeping guard on the way they came in.
Apon reaching her. "My Lady. May I have a moment of your time?" Dex always seemed to be the opisit of what he was. More goofy and not series unless it called for him to be. "I cannot help but see that something is bothering you. You realize that Chase is trying to do something everyone wants to do but only few can, and that is lead. He is capable and we are alive so he must be some what good at it." Dex smiles. He was trying to smooth over the ruff edges that had come up as of late. He looks over at Chase doing his Jedi whatever it was called and looks back around the room waiting for her to reply.

Pushing through the berry bush Chase stopped as he cleared the plant that was blocking the large archway. What he saw before him made him stand in awe. He has heard stories from Master Garet about statues such as this but with the Jedi purge he never believed he'd see one.
**"Found a room over here. Has four connecting rooms attached to it. So far two of them look empty."** He called back just loud enough for the others to hear. He didn't mention the statue of the Jedi as it would probably push Nayren over the edge. As it was he had enough problems with her.
Running a hand along the bush as he walked away from the entrance to walk around the room looking into the other four rooms. They all looked to be barren. He finally came to a stop in front of the Ten meter statue. He took a moment to look over the statue from all angles taking care to spot any detail that may stand out on the figure and the dais that it stood upon.

"Karav Jax."
Kasga steps onto the second floor balcony hallway first. Just as the third floor hallway above it too circles the large 60 m diameter room. Even more brush grows on this floor covering much of the walls and stone floor. Tar`ja steps onto the second floor next to her Duro`s companion without incident.
In front of the pair a single open room waits to be explored. Other rooms seem to be spaced out a few meters apart. From the railing you can see that the room looks sparse. As you scan the area many rooms look as though they may be blocked by vegetation, that is assuming the rooms continue around the balcony hallway every few meters.
"Leo Garet."
Chase stands before the large stone statue contemplating its meaning. The mention of his master brings memories of meditation to assist in focusing exercise. In the early years of his training Chase would follow Master Garet to training halls fitted with meditation chambers. The chambers while not needed by practiced jedi masters acted as a crutch for young-lings who had only begun their journey into the ways of the force.
Is it possible that your group may have stumbled upon a lost jedi training hall? Inspecting the statue and dais the jedi finds no writing no markings of any kind. In many of the meditation chambers used by young-lings the rooms where keep sparse to help focus the young minds who`s thoughts could so easily stray.

<strong>In a hole in the ground the soon to be dead contemplate the dead.</strong>**.**
Naryen was pleased that at least Chase found something noteworthy. The lack of another passageways leading into this place, so far, was welcome news for defense but unwelcome in terms of escape. As Dexter approached with an air of determination she guessed what he was going to say. She guessed wrong. So much she could say about leading but this wasn't the time or the place.
She tried to divide her attention between her Bothan companion and the way they came in. **"I share your concern. My attempts to address his recklessness have created more problems yet others seem to be able to do the same freely."** She looked to Dexter with a naked expression of frustration and desperation. **"Do I really come across so differently than everyone else? Tar'ja echoed my words yet the same from me is met with confrontations."**
Naryen points a cross face back to the way they came in. **"His brazenness combined with carelessness exposes us all to unnecessary risk yet when I voice my concerns I'm shut out at best. You yourself know what being reckless and obvious will do for someone being hunted! Luck always runs out. He used his energy sword to murder someone in public when Jedis are one of most hunted in the galaxy, then…!"** With a flexing fist, she stopped herself realizing she was starting to rant in frustration. So many things all wanting to tumble out at a seemingly friendly ear.
Using a calming breath. **"I'm sorry. I now realize that in the Empire if you voiced an unpopular opinion you ended up dead. I had hoped that I was in a place where I could be part of a real team where opinions are valued."** Her voice then became uncharacteristically small. **"I've been silent before, I can be again. If that's what it takes to keep the Empire from doing to others what it did to me and my people, so be it."** Her eyes were shards of ice floating in a calm pool of frigid water.
With a small smile and a chuckle she turned back to Dexter for a moment **"I'm sorry, this is my problem. Thank you for voicing your concerns."** She turned back to the passageway with the same seemingly blank expression of before.

Tar'ja looked below her, waiting for the duros to move out of the way of the rope before she continues down to the floor and to his side. How did so much vegetation get here? It should have all died in the heat and such shouldn't it? Where was the water coming from...how did the plants get up to this floor and the one above? ugh so many questions.
She moves forward and points to the rooms "You wanna take that side and I'll take the other?" she offers, removing her blaster just in case and shifts to the rooms covered, looking for openings through the vegetation.

Now that he's no longer climbing, Kasga draws his Travotti Service Pistol and sets it to blaster fire. As the pair moves carefully into the room, Kasga comments, **"We might need a fusion cutter to cut our way into the other rooms."**

Chase left the room behind him as memories of Master Garet hung in his mind and places they had visited. Looking to his left he saw Dexter talking with a still crouched Nayren who was watching the way they had entered. Not wanting to intrude in the conversation only to have it misconstrued again he went right passing any rooms in an effort to find a stairway that would lead down.
Secretly he hoped that he would find something here that would help him in his training. Finding another Jedi Master was basically out of the question but maybe something was left behind by the temples former occupants that could help him. ***Maybe something to help the others understand what I have trouble explaining. If they care.*** He thought as he lost his concentration again. Focusing like before he began using the names timing them with his feelings. With his eyes open to the physical and himself as a whole open to the ebb and flow to the Force he looked for a way down.

"But my lady. Chase is only working with what he has a viable to him. Sure he has done thing wrong, but so have I and you don't condemn me for it I hope." Dexter tries his best to smooth over whatever he can. "If it will help I will be a neutral voice in your discussions with Chase. That way hopefully you can understand each other better." Dexter hopes that this will work so things will work smoother then they have. Laying a hand on her shoulder. "Also remember My Lady. You are not in the Empire anymore and we are your friends. And we will be there to help and protect you no matter what." Dexter smiles. "Now shall we see what Chase has found?" He bows deeply motioning with one hand the direction the Jedi was in.

"Ram Parsa."
Tar`ja enters the first room closest to her left. Inside the room a stone bed is built into the stone itself to the left. The room itself seems to be constructed of the stone just as the balcony hallway. Dusty old sheets rest inside the bed which has not seen use in some time. Nothing else is found within this room.
Kasga moves into the room on his right. Inside the room is a bed cut into the stone. More dusty sheets are found as well as a wooden stick carved to resemble a light saber hilt, is found within the sheets.
Chase again reaches out with his feelings through the force. As before he senses life within the wall on the opposing side of the meditation chamber. Outside the meditation chamber Chase notices both Tar`ja and Kasga exploring on the second floor.
"Sola Dol."
Dexter continues his conversation with Naryen without much success. His words had fallen on deaf ears as the former imperial becomes lost in thought ignoring the Bothan.
Tar`ja explores another two similar rooms, finding only a repeat of the same in the first but in the second Tar`ja finds a dead data pad on a small wooden side table. The data pad is an older model with a slight crack in the casing, otherwise with a good charge still in good condition.
"Bama Osh."
Kasga also explores another two rooms continuing his path to the right. The first room the Duro`s finds a holo recorder, the battery is almost completely drained but the pilot does find several holo pictures stored within before the battery completely loses power.
Kasga manages to shuffle through three holo pictures, the first of a Kel Dor jedi master standing with arms folded before him, then giving a slight bow. The second shows a small Mon Calamari student, a young girl smiling as she balances a small sphere about a meter over her head. The third shows a rotating planet covered mostly by water, this holo picture is labled Mon Calamari. Kasga was unable to locate anything other then dusty bed sheets in the third room.
"Ken Cass."

Tar'ja frowns at the room, a bed...shelves...and again..and again...rooms? so this place was a cell or it was a temple. Interesting. She wondered if Kasga was finding similar things in his rooms as she entered another and spied the data pad. Picking it up and turning it over for examination she hums and pockets it, she'll work on it later when she has a power source to use on it.
She exits and glances about her, looking for Kasga to join her again; deciding better she holsters her blaster and grabs hold of the rope again and uses it to climb further down, it was time to explore the next level "Kasga." she calls "I'm going down." better to let him know.

Chase looked around the meditation room for a last time. Thoughts ran through his head as he wondered what it would have been like to have studied at a place like this. One filled with life and others who practiced the Force weather they be Jedi or not. The thought of many practitioners under one roof and the amount of knowledge that could be shared was almost incomprehensible. With a smile he exited the chamber and walked back towards where they came into the area. There she saw Nayren still keeping guard along with Dexter. The two seemed to be talking.
His smile faded when he figured she was complaining to Dexter about his impetuous Jedi ways and how they would be the down fall of the whole team. Quickly he pushed the assumption aside. ***No Chase. That's not the way. Things may not be good between us but they will get better since they can't get much worse. What was it that Gare once said. 'Time and reflection will often clear the things that cloud ones perception of things.'*** He calmed greatly as a smile came back as he approached the two coming to a stop an equal distance between them.
**"Nayren, Dex."** He said in a quieter voice as he got close. his eyes moved from back and forth from both as he spoke of his findings. **"Looks like a meditation chamber back there with a few rooms that offshoot from it. Based on what I have seen with Master Garet it resembles other training halls he's taken me too when I first started my Jedi training. Like the others this place is teeming with life and has become overgrown form lack of care."** He jerked a thumb to where he had just came from. There was a calmness about him that seemed to be obvious to those that took the time to look for it. Weather it was magnified by the place would be anyone's guess. **"There's even berry bushes with the largest most delicious looking berries on them that I have ever seen."** When he heard Tar'ja call out that she was heading lower he looked to where they had set up the rope for the climb down. **"I think I'll join them down there."** He said as he brought his view back to Dex and Nayren. His smile was still in place though a bit smaller. **"I have an idea about the butterflies but I can't do it from up here."**
Before stepping away he placed a hand on Smaller Bothans shoulder and looked at Nayren. **"You staying here and keeping watch with Nayren or would you like to get a better look at this place. I'm sure that your curiosity is peaked."** He removed his hand from his friends shoulder as he backed up to the overhang where the rope dangled down. Seeing the other two he called out. **"I'm coming down."** With the rope tended to he carefully climbed over the rail and used the rope to descend to where Tar'ja and Kasga were. **"Either of you find anything?"** He asked.

Dexter understood that some of Chase's actions could have put them in danger, but Dexter had done a few bone headed things along the way as well. "Of course my lady. As I said before if it helps I will aid you in talking to Chase if you need." As Dex was motioning to Nayren to see what Chase had found he saved them the trouble and appeared. He listen to what he found and the delicious sounding berries that he had found as well. "That sounds very interesting my friend. So this was a Jedi training facility. That would explain a thing a bit more." Dex remembers the few things that he knew about Jedi and that was very little. Most of it was the wild tales he had heard in a cantiana here and there. Chase moves to join Tar'ja and Kasga in looking around more. "Of course I will stay here and help My lady guard the entrance." Dex bows low and smiles.

<strong>In a hole in the ground the soon to be dead contemplate the dead.</strong>**.**
Naryen saw Chase approach and braced herself for more irrelevant preaching or sideways confrontation or some other ploy that he'd used in the past with her. Tense and readied she considered the litany of tactics he had used and started categorizing what she had tried in the past and what new approach she would use if she hadn't decided to hold her tongue this time.
... And found all that mental preparation to be an utter waste and nearly gaped at the change in Chase. **How** he was talking to her was so different Naryen almost missed **what** he was saying to her. Her half shocked, half pleased expression changed to wide-eyed amazement as the realization dawned on her.
A Jedi Temple!
***This place? This?***
It seemed to her that every brick in this place vibrated at direct odds to nearly every experience Naryen had had with Chase since she met him. That thought stuck there staring back at her as she watched Chase interacting with Dexter. The thought seemed somewhat out of place.
In her dumbfounded state she was unable to reply to Chase other than with an expression more amazement than shock and a nod. As he walked away her thoughts became more focused. No, it was **very** out of place. She realized that there had been a handful of experiences that stood out because they were so at odds with the rest of his character.
Each realization slipped into place, one after the other, like skirmish fighters dropping from their carriers nest. His not handling confrontations well, perhaps because of being powerless to protect his master. Could that explain his fast tracking to lethal conflict and his short sightedness? Does that also explain his rage issues that seem to infect his coping abilities so much? Is that also why he's so easily enraged? Is that how she got trapped in his anti Imperial rhetoric and not see it for what it was? A cry for help? A cry for an ally?
She muttered to herself, though Dexter would be able to overhear: **I need lessons in how to be a better friend.**
Naryen wiped the new expression of sadness from her face and focused back on her guard duties. The team needs her now, she can try to mend things with Chase later.

“ Synyc Starwind.”
Tar`ja quickly descends to the bottom level, alone. With the use of Kasga`s rope she easily touches down on the ground level. The floor beneath her feet feels more like the ground under a forest canopy. The aura of plant life is even stronger on this level, as the Twi`lek takes in her surroundings.
Kasga follows after Tar`ja only a moment after landing on the bottom floor after the woman. The Duros quickly begins to scan the area. The pair find themselves under a small Wroshyr tree, though to the untrained the tree is large reaching almost to the third floor. Various flowering plants and ferns cover the area, dirt rests on the floor under your feet. You can hear small avionic animals chirping at the edges of the oasis, you are forced to swat away a few flying insects as you survey the area.
“Qyn Roeder.”
From above Tar`ja and Kasga hear Chase call out “I`m coming down.” Looking up the you can see the human swinging his leg over the railing in order to begin his decent. From beside the tree, to which you both are only one meter away from you hear the unmistakable sound of a blasters safety clicking off. Chase has only begun his decent, and would be too high to hear such a soft sound. Both Tar`ja and Kasga stand motionless as they are caught off guard by the sudden threat.
Above on the third floor Chase lowers himself heading towards the lower levels, leaving Dexter and Naryen alone on the third level. Chase using the rope begins to lower himself down, below him Tar`ja and Kasga appear to be waiting for him to arrive.
“Torm Arlos.”
A soft voice follows the click of the blasters safety, “Do not move and you may live through this day. Who are you and what are you doing here.?” Without moving you can only make out a shadowy figure hidden behind some ferns seating against the tree.

She was about to look over when the sound of a blaster clicking had her pausing and gaze narrowing.
Shit.
"I'm coming down." came the shout from above.
double shit.
"get him off on the second floor." she whispers to Kasga, last thing they needed was a shadow figure shooting at their jedi. She didn't raise her hands, and was quite glad for the cloak in this moment "We're travelers...happened upon this place by accident." she states as calmly as she could in what she hoped was non-threatening.
"What are you doing in this place." she asks, "hiding or..do you live here?"
Shifting her head just a twitch under the hood, to better get an idea of who and what they were dealing with. She just needed to be faster in the draw in the worst case senario.

Chase began his decent down be rope. With his feet circled around he rope he went hand over hand lowering himself farther down. Keeping a steady but careful pace he passed the bottom of the floor he left and continued down.
Pausing to take a look below he saw Tar'ja and Kasga looking around. From his vantage point the bottom floor looked overgrown. **"I have an idea about the butterflies but I'm not sure it will work."**. He called out again but not as loud as before.
Again he started to decend coming up to the ledge for the second floor and dipping below it slightly. It wouldn't be long till he reached them.

<strong>And from that hole in the ground, a whimper&#8230;</strong>**.**
...
Naryen waits patiently but on guard aware of her surroundings and also her new insights. Was it that she was so focused on Tar'jas and Chases anti Imperial rhetoric that she could have so easily been maneuvered by her own? All she could see in Chases own short sighted recklessness and arrogance was both the Imperial party line and Imperial behavior itself. The parallels between those two seemingly similar thought-forms and her own stared back at her.
Did she really hate herself that much?
The answer simmered back at her and she didn't like the dishonor to her parents and culture it contained.

Kasga freezes and slowly moves his hands away from his sides. He calls out, **”Chase, there are a couple of rooms on level two to that could have been residences. They might mean more to you than me.”**
Peering through the shadows the...being was hiding in, Kasga tries to ferret out more details.

Kasga's voice drifted up to him. The mention of rooms that may have been residences would need to be looked into further for anything that may have been left behind. That could be done later as he again heard another voice through the Force. Nayren would probably say he was being stubborn but he wanted to check out the butterflies that seemed to coincide with the names.
He paused for a moment to look at the second floor. **"Good there might have some on the third floor also though they were barren which isn't unusual."** He called down as paused he looked around. **"I'll look at them later though. I want to check out those insects and see if there really is a connection between Master Garet's name and the insect. I just wish he would have told me about this place. I won't be long."**

Dexter waits with Naryen while the others check other areas. "So my Lady. While we have the time, why don't we talk and get to know each other better. If you would like I could start, but my life is some what boring I must say compared to yours." Dex was not trying to pry, but it might help her to talk about the past and resolve a few things.
He was willing to help where he could, but if she didn't want to he would not push her. Dex waited for her to begin.

"Shamara Darmal."
The shadowy figure pauses a moment, perhaps to consider Tar`ja`s words. Then responding in the same low soft voice "Accident eh? A little hard to believe. Where did you come from? Who are you working for?"
Chase continues to move down the rope. At this point with the rope making the job easier Chase has made it to the half way point between the third and second levels.
The soft voice perks up again. "Better tell your friend to stop talking, warning the others above would not be wise." You can not see it but you can imagine that the shadowy figure has the blaster trained of both Tar`ja and Kasga.
"Rachel Starwalker."
The young jedi continues his descent towards the bottom level, now making it to the second floor. Around the entire level Chase can see a similar balcony running the circle around the level. Several small rooms dot the walls in both directions, from your vantage point you are unable to make out anything inside. The human makes his decision and continues down sensing nothing new, though his friends below have not moved still waiting for him to reach the bottom.
"Kodai Kahn."
The soft voice speaks again, as hard as you try the voice is soft and low you are unable to determine much from it. "Tell your friend to stop climbing, and answer my questions."

Tar'ja scowls under her hood before calling up, low enough to not carry but enough to just have chase hear "Stop climbing." she states "Get on the balcony." she orders again "No questions, just do it." short answers...they were better in this sort of situation.
"We came from a number of places." she states lowly towards the shadow "and we work for ourselves." she nods her head slowly to the shadow "How about you step into the light. Lower the weapon. and we discuss." she nods to him again "We'll tell you more if you give us some reason to tell you. and no. the threat of shooting is not incentive."

"Ryan Yung."
As Tar`ja speaks to the shadowed figure, high above on the third floor Naryen and Dexter stand guard. Just as the Bothan attempts to make small talk both Dexter and Naryen hear a low repeating humming noise coming from the direction your group came.
"Karav Jax."
The voice reply's to Tar`ja`s request. "I think not, I am very comfortable where I am." The response is followed by a short burst of coughing. Tar`ja then realizes that the voice and the blaster is not the shadowy figure by the tree, but from somewhere else. "You have still to answer my questions. Who do you work for? Who sent you?"
"Leo Garet."

Tar'ja narrows her gaze at the figure, then turns her head slowly to search the area, something was going on here....She wasn't sure yet if this shadow person was just the fear aspect or was maybe a distraction, best to not let it out of sight but...the voice was elsewhere.
"you're playing with us..." she states softly, searching the area slowly "You don't want us to move...but your voice is in the wrong direction...so we're close to you." she hums faintly and takes a step backward, it was just a hunch.
"We side with freedom." she states "Let's just say that for now."

Chase looked down as Tar'ja called out to him. With a confused look on his face he continued to look and finally noticed that neither of them had moved since he had started down. For a moment he contemplated continuing. **"What's going on down there?"** He said as he reached for the balcony pulling himself over the ledge and planted his feet on the stone floor. Once there he positioned himself for a quick descend to the floor below. As another added precaution he removed this lightsaber from its concealed location only to clip it to the ring at the front of his utility belt for easier access.
Again he looked down below and called out loud enough for them to hear. **"Why aren't you two moving?"** He asked though he feared he may already know the answer.
With a practiced calm and effort he drew upon the Force and reached out with his feelings and senses to the floor below. He made his presence overt in the area. If there were other Force-sensitives around he wanted them to know he was here and that their group meant no harm.
If there was trouble he was surprised that he didn't feel it.

A blaster is a blaster in Kasga's experience, so he is careful to hold still.
Tar'ja suggests the man is not quite where he appears to be. A hologram maybe. That's burnin' advanced if so. He looks slowly around hoping to figure out where this man really is. **"I lost my brother to an oppression. We seek to free ourselves from domination."**

Tar`ja scans the area shrubs, bushes, trees, large flowers but nothing else. "I am not playing with you, I never play when lives are at stake." You can hear a little anger in the voice that time, you must have struck a cord you also notice a slight femininity to the soft voice.
"Cale Sinan."
Chase holds on to the rope looking down, unsure of what to do next and unsure of why his friends below where acting strangely by not moving the jedi reaches out for answers. Life surrounds this place, it is saturated with life. The jedi finds it hard to focus on any one thing including his friends below, above him Chase senses something .... cold.
On the third floor the humming noise gets a little louder. It seems to be repeating in pulses almost like a small repulsorlift engine. Looking down the tunnel to where you came you see only darkness.
"Ram Parsa."
At Kasga`s bold statement the voice returns. "Many have lost loved ones in this war, you speak of domination but in my experience it is the victor who writes history and molds it to their will. I need names, who sent you who do you work for?"

<strong>In a hole in the ground the soon to be dead contemplate the dead.</strong>**.**
Naryen was confused that Dexter would want such detailed information under the circumstances. Perhaps that was his background that every moment is communication. She could relate to that in many ways.
With a slight shrug to match her slight smile at the request she began with **"The Empire has ensnared many people to both end and ensnare others. I was one of those trapped in it's methods as was my home world. With the help of a resistance group my people may yet survive and so I am indebted to them."** She keeping it intentionally vague because details would distract her.
Naryen was about to ask Dexter his question back when her ears perked at what seemed like a single repulsorlift unit. ***It's either Solen or one of Tashes goon whelps.***
With a dart of the eyes to Dexter then back to the hole she hunkered down and focused all she could to the source of the sound and possible new threat. In a hushed tone to Dexter, eerie in it's cold calm, **"The others are likely spread out around this place. For now we're it."**

As he reached out with the Force Chase felt the overwhelming life that lived within the temple. It was almost impossible to simply focus on only two things below him. Then a shiver over took his body as feeling of cold came to him from above. ***That's not good. It almost feels like the Dark Side of the Force.*** Add that to the fact that neither of them were answering him meant something was wrong. Not only above but below and here he was stuck in the middle between the two.
He leaned over the edge and projected his voice down loud enough for them and anyone else down there to hear him **"Something isn't right above. A feeling through the Force. Whatever is going on down there resolve it quickly. I think something is coming. The others may need our help."**
He made himself ready to go either up or down to help either group at a moments notice.

Tar'ja smirked faintly under her hood, struck a cord and discovered gender. Good. The shadow was unwilling to spill blood if it was unnecessary, likely then...'she' believed they were hostiles in 'her' home. hm..
Her eyes continue to scan "Indeed it's true, and depending on which sides win many of us will be free or captive." she says "You're asking us to give up names, we're not going to do that..and you know that, such would be foolish when we do not know whom you work for."
Chase speaks and a frown crosses her lips, damn, they were running out of time then.
"We don't wear white, if that is what you want to know. and either you're here because it's safe or your here because this was home for you at one time. So show yourself. We don't mean you harm...unless you give us reason."

Dex was listening to what Naryen had to say about her past. She was being as vague as possible about it. It was something that Dex had gotten used to and he knew in time he would get his answer. She was about to ask him something when they heard a low rumble. "Repulsor engine? How would anyone know where we went?" He guess they didn't cover there tracks as well as they ha hoped. He moves stand by the mouth to the tunnel and check to make sure his blaster is ready. Then she looks over to him. "The others are likely spread out around this place. For now we're it." He smiles. "Well at least the battle may alert the others."

"Sola Dol."
The shadow pauses a moment after Kasga`s partial response before speaking again to Tar`ja. "You are wise not to reveal your contacts, only an imperial or an imbecile would have done so .... Is your friend always so willing to announce his force beliefs?" The anger in the woman`s voice has diminished, and she seems to have stopped trying to disguise her voice. You notice movement behind you in the opposite direction of the first shadow.
"I would stand to greet you if I could, I have been injured when escaping the local thugs." With a sigh she continues. "At this point I have nothing to lose, you are allied with those who would hunt me and thus have successfully tracked me down to end me or you are possibly something else."
"Bama Osh." The names continue on in a predictable rhythmic pattern.
On the third level both Dexter and Naryen listen to the unknown sound. Remembering the speeder bikes the town goons drove the repulsor engines on those made a buzzing sound, plus the sound seems to be coming from the tunnel or cavern your group entered from not the ruins above.
Squinting into the dark tunnel both Naryen and Dexter notice a light deep inside the tunnel. The light seems to be scanning from left to right, and is moving closer.
"Ken Cass."

Tar'ja smirks faintly beneath the hood and turns to the movement "Believe me. we are the last ones that would hunt after you, or end you. If you revel yourself, and we start again as friends, then we can aid you."
She motions above faintly "Yes. he does." she glances up with a sigh "however, his feelings have been fairly correct so shall we move on from this stand off?" she turns back to the new shadow "It may be in our best interest to get you up and moving should there be danger."
She motions to herself and her covered appearance "You will forgive us if we do not reveal our names first hm? some of us are being hunted too."

Chase was watching what was going on below intently. Something was definitely wrong but neither Tar'ja or Kasga had given any indication that they needed help.
He watched as Tar'ja motioned up towards him faintly as she looked up. With the hood up it was hard to make anything out. So far though no indication that they needed help was given.
He called down once more. Projectinghis voice down so none above would hear. **"Is all ok down there? If so I'm going up to see what's going on."**
As the young Jedi waited for some sign from either of his two friends he held onto the rope as he stood on the top of the stone railing. Doing so would make a clime up or down a bit quicker.

With a grunt of pain the shadowed figure stands, though the feat that's some amount of effort out of her as she does. "Call me Jerreb, I am a .... traveler of sorts." You recognize the name as the individual to whom it is your mission to recover. "If it is true that you and your friends are being hunted, then perhaps we share the same side. It is after all well known that many cells exist with little to no communication with each other."
Above on the third floor the light floats closer, there is no doubt now that the pulsing sound is coming from the source of the light. As Chase hangs in mid air he can not shake the coldness he is feeling from above.

Realizing his impatience was out of place he calmed himself and felt the coldness from above. It was a feeling that went to the bone. One that wouldn't go away.
That feeling made up his mind as he moved one hand up the rope and began to climb. Something was heading towards Nayren and Dexter. Something bad. Something dangerous.

Tar'ja eyes the way the woman moves, the name and hums faintly. So this was who they were searching for, and injured...in this place to hide and heal...
she nods to the woman "What hurts, and how did you get injured." She moves towards her, hands away from her blaster as a show that she was not about to hurt the other, granted she wasn't really asking, at least, the tone didn't seem to be a question, more of an order or demand of information.

Dex waits by the entrance of the tunnel they came through. The hum of a replusor engine coming closer. "You know this kind of makes sense." He says with a little laugh. "We find this beautiful, peaceful places and then trouble comes knocking. The galaxy has a interesting sense of humor." Dex always sees things differently then others. His life was strange that way. He checks his blaster again and waits for the enemy or friend to get closer. It was strange how life was like the games of chance that he liked. You either drew the card you needed or you didn't. Either way he was starting to like the thrill of it all. "As for if we should check out what it is or not. We have cover here further a head we won't, so I would say wait and see, but up to you."

She waits with Dexter, tuned in as much as she can be, and wishes she had some supernatural way of communicating with the others that the Imperials on the planet couldn't detect.
***And if not Solen, cover is where I'd want to stay too.*** Her eyes are reminiscent of a caged animal as much as the rest of her looks calm and collected.

"Torm Arlos."
The pulsing repulsor seems to resonate slightly faster, the light itself ceases to move towards you but focuses on bot Naryen and Dexter. With two rapid flashes of red light the area of the tunnel is briefly illuminated revealing a spherical dark droid with multiple appendages. The droid hovers motionless about 10 meters down the tunnel. As the red flashes irrupt the sound of blaster fire accompanies both flashes, the droid has just fire on both Dexter and Naryen.
Naryen narrowly avoids taking a hit to her shoulder, she could feel the heat from the searing gasses as the blast screams past (9hit points damage). Dexter quickly ducks but the droids aim compensates, the Bothan ducks into the blast as it strikes him solidly in the chest almost knocking him from his feet(critical hit 18 damage, this exceeds you damage threshold putting you at -1 condition track).
"Shamara Darmal."
Chase still hanging from the rope hears both blasts followed by a low grunt. His friends are under attack, almost near the top the jedi closes the distance to the third floor. From the railing Chase can see Dexter holding his chest in pain a blaster score mark almost dead center. Naryen seems to be using the walls for cover from the tunnel, inside the tunnel .... darkness, cold darkness.
"Rachel Starwalker."
The Bothan woman continues "My transport, how nice. Injured, yes the locals ..." From the third floor your trio hears the unmistakable sound of two blaster shots, followed by what sounded like a grunt. Something is wrong up there. "What is." You can see Jerreb`s ears perk up at the sound then she turns back you Tar`ja and Kasga "You where followed! You brought them here." With as much haste as she can muster the Bothan woman heads for the side of the large room.

Dexter sees the droid and then hears the blaster shots. Then there is blinding pain and everything goes on it's head as he almost goes on his back. Grabbing his chest he hears nothing but noise. Thinking to himself. *"Fool you rolled right into it. The Galaxy has it in for me, I am sure of it."*
He tries to regain his footing get to cover and help Naryen.

Chase was still several feet from the railing when he heard the unmistakable sound of blaster fire. The sound of his friends being under attack spurred him on the last bit. As his hands found purchase on the railing he pulled himself up.
When his head crested the edge He first saw Dexter clutching his chest as he backpedaled out of the way. To the Bothans left he could see Nayren using the walls as cover. As before he could feel the cold darkness coming from the tunnel. It was unsettling but with his training he remained calm as he swung a leg over the rail. When his second foot touched the solid rock his light saber was already in his hand. It remained unlit. He hadn't been seen yet and the unmistakable sound of the weapon activating would only give him away.

Tar'ja was listening carefully to what had been done but the tale was cut off by the sudden sound of blaster fire. Jerking her head up she curses softly, watching the woman make haste away, glancing between the rope and the target she mutters another curse and takes off after the woman, they could hope for now that the others could handle things, the woman was going to be slow in trying to climb and would be better suited for after fighting...or finding an alternate exit would be good too.

Just as she's thinking about how she's lost people under her command, slightly above Dexters center of mass explodes in flame and the stink of charred hair and flesh. The smell of burnt meat assaults Naryens senses. She recalls wounds she's seen suffered by others, that look just like Dexters, that they never got up from.
**"No!"** That single syllable, deep, passionate, reverberating with power and dripping with menace and rallying vengeance didn't even register as her own voice to her ears.
Naryen considers how Imperial assault droids tend to behave: aggressive. Based on that and what this one has already done she decides that if she doesn't do something to slow it down she's dead anyway, never mind everyone else.
(( Been a while. If she'd benefit from an all out attack to nail that thing then so be it. Burn any needed points to accomplish that goal. She isn't going to be aware of Dexter pulling himself to safety until after she takes the shot anyway. Berserker rage? <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ))

When the area above him erupts in blaster fire, Kasga is surprised in spite of himself. I had expected the repulsors to turn off. 
The woman he had been talking to accused him of betrayal, but he didn't really have time reassure her. Best I can do. **"Note they are shooting us not you. The locals don't like us either."**
Then he runs for the rope he had used to climb down here.

"Ryn Yung."
Naryen takes a step between the tunnel archway holds her blaster out in front of her and pulls the trigger. Firing blindly into the darkness too many thoughts race through the woman`s mind to consider the less then tactical position the former officer has placed herself into. The red blast rockets into the darkness hitting, something with a smack. the sound of metal fragments pinging against the tunnel walls and floor follow.
Chase lands on the floor lightsaber drawn. Looking down the tunnel the jedi sees only darkness, and Naryen blocking the way as she stands at the entrance and fires.
Moving to the side Dexter scrambles out of the line of fire. Huddled to the side of the entrance the Bothan holds tight to his wound. Not out of the game yet Dexter does see the room start to spin slightly.
"Karav Jax."
Jerreb starts to limp off towards the far wall on this bottom level. As she moves she mutters under her breath, though both Kasga and Tar`ja clearly heard. "Where there is one there will be more." With a nod Jerreb invites you. "There is the front door, has not seen use in some time but it is how I gained entry, you are welcome to follow."
"Leo Garet."

Tar'ja nods her head as she follows, drawing up her com to the others "There's a door down here to get out, I'm going with her, hurry behind." she then moves to the womans side to offer a means of support for the trip.
She should have figured there would be opposition eventually, she had gotten to lost in where they were, Naryen had the right idea to watch and wait. The thought made her sigh internally, they needed to start putting more faith in each other and the experience they all had.

Chase hit the floor running with his lightsaber in hand. He saw Nayren standing in the archway with blaster raised pointing into the darkness. **"Deidra find some cover."**. Be said hurriedly as he took up position beside her.
Just then his comlink sounded and he heard Tar'ja's voice saying they were beading for a door. **"Wonderful more unencrypted comm use. Just what we need."** He half hissed under his breath.
Hazarding a look around the archway Chase peered into the darkness. Ready to defend his friends and himself from be coldness within the tunnel.

As soon as the trigger was pulled Naryen shifted her attention to Dexter, or rather he made a noise and became the subject of her attention. ***He's alive!***
She tucked and moved to him, trying to show as little profile to the tunnel as possible. Putting a hand under whatever arm corresponding to the hand holding his wound, she tries to pull him away from the entrance and along the wall to cover, even if temporary.
Happy he's alive and feeling the impending death upon them she tries her best to not vomit over her friend as the smell of his charred flesh presses on her senses.

Dexter still worrying about his wound and getting into cover. Then Naryen grabs him and helps him get to cover. He looks up at her. "So this is what it takes to get your attention." Smiling at her then the world strats to spin. He steadys himself and tries not to fall over. " Think that took some wind out of my sails. We need to find another exit or a place to hold up. Any ideas?" Dex knew the cover would not hold if the droid came out of the tunnel. If they didn't take out the droid and then bug out they maybe more. Thinking for a second. "Disable it if you can. I might able to figure out from it who sent it."

"Cale Sinan.'
Jerreb slowly makes her way towards the far side of the large ground level oasis. Just as Tar`ja moves to follow Kasga stops her, with a hand on her shoulder. "We can not leave our friends, that was blaster fire!"
The Bothan woman does not stop, she continues towards her destination. In labored breaths she states "The entrance is at this end of the garden, you can not miss it." Jerreb motions with her hand in the direction she is heading. "Where there is blaster fire .... there is sure to be more. I am sure the local authorities will not be long now."
Kasga motions to the rope that brought your group to the ground floor. "I can`t leave without the others." The pilot then turns on his heel and walks to the rope.
"Ram Parsa."
Both Naryen and Dexter move to cover just as Chase rushes to the tunnel entrance light saber drawn. From inside you hear the sound of metal thump against the stone floor. The sound of the repulsor engine now gone.
The young jedi takes a few steps inside using the sword as a light source, finding only the twisted remains of a spherical reconnaissance droid laying ruined on the tunnel floor.
"Sola Dol."

Tar'ja turn's to her companion frowning at him from under her hood "we can't let the entire reason we're on this damn planet run off on her own while she's hurt either." she motions to the fleeing Bothan woman "they'll follow, go and help them, I'll see if I can get her to simply take refuge in the exit until the others can catch up."
This was bad, but there were three of them up there, they had to be able to handle things on their own...she could, why couldn't they? "Go and help them." she pushes lightly on Kasga's arm, "Go, I'll stall her." She turns then to follow after the woman, she just needed a bit of time to stall her, they'd be fine..they would be.

Naryen only just registered Chase yelling her alias and grumbling something about unencrypted comm chatter, her focus was entirely on the smoldering and smoking wound on Dexters cardio-vascular core.
(((Let's see if I can recall this: Naryen will use her Treat Injury as an appraisal on Dexters condition to see if he is okay to be moved or if something needs to be done right away. Prod, pulse etc. "Taking a ten"? I'll move on assuming a few things.)))
*"So this is what it takes to get your attention."* She looks up at Dexters pained yet clearly still living face as her feelings shifts from nausea to an urge to grab some section of Dexters fur and giving it a sharp twist. Helping him to proper cover she joins him where they cannot be seen from the tunnel. Naryens eyes relax with humour and relief.
With a smirk on her face and in her voice **"The dead are the center of attention at their time of honor. Want attention that badly?"** She mutters a bit of her appraisal to reassure Dexter as much as herself: **"No arteries or veins cauterized open or compromised bone or muscle structures."** She nods and almost sighs out-loud. **"Concussive shock from a bit of you and your clothes flash-vaping next to your core. I'll need to brace it. Let's…"** she makes to help Dexter to his feet, then stops.
***No repulsor sound.***
She glances up to Dexters face with a pensive expression, then around to where she expected Chase. Seeing he's not there and not hearing any obvious signs of further conflict, she calls into the tunnel. **"Did I get it?"** As her inquiry registers to her own ears, her mind answers. If she did get it then it was a recon remote. Having used one on Varbrindi the memory shocks her back to focus.
With darkened eyes she turns back to Dexters wound. **"Sit-up and lift your shirt."** Her voice is commanding and her motions purposeful. She helps Dexter sit-up and takes out her medpack while he lifts his shirt. She shakes her head at Dexters suggested course of action. **"It was live sending. They've got my face on net."** She shoots the wound with an irrigation bulb marked by antiseptic and analgesic sigils and secures a bacta-patch over top. Once that's in place she quickly wraps around the bottom of his rib-cage to support his diaphragm* so his traumatized chest muscles are supported.
(((*or whatever their called in a Bothan, she's going by feel and what she can tell of his anatomy from that. Hopefully this should restore his condition track status.)))
When that's in place she helps Dexter to his feet. **"We need out. Now."** saying it loud enough for both Dexter and Chase. Her practiced mind reviews the options. One way in tunnel which will be targeted soon by approaching vehicles and a rope to another level that Dexter could get to but no climb in his current condition.

Dexter allows himself to be moved to cover. Small winces run across his face. At Naryen's comment. "I suppose this is better then being dead." He looks down at his tunic and frowns. "I really liked this one. Oh well guess it is a small price." Then she stops listens and says. "Did I get it?" He listens as well not hearing the sounds of the replusor engine. "Suppose you may have. If it was a recon mod we need to leave. I could disable it and use it to track our attackers later, but there is still risk of being tracked." Dex thinks for a moment. "Maybe I could use it as a trap to slow down anyone coming this way. Get it working and set to attack them. Won't buy a lot of time but might slow them a bit." With his injury it might take longer and the mistakes might be made. But it was worth a shot.
((OCC: Want to program or set it to patrol the cave enterance and shot at someone coming through the tunnel into the garden area. Can that be done with what I have on the character? And do we have enough time?))

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **Yogi** (2011-10-16 03:32:24)

Reaching the tunnel entrance Chase was greeted with the sound of metal meeting the floor as it thumped against the stone floor. The whine of the repulsor engine faded into nothingness. His lightsaber caused bluish shadows to play across the twisted remains of the recon droid. ***Looks like she hit it dead center, Blew it to pieces.*** He thought as he looked over from the now defunct droid.
From beyond the entrance he heard Nayren's single question. Did she get it? He turned away from the twisted smoking remains and walked back to the two. Clearing the entrance he moved to the side away from the opening and shut down his weapon as Dexter was talking about using the drone for their purposes. She shook his head indicating a negative. Looking at Nayren he pointed with the hilt of his weapon. **"You hit it dead center. It's a mess that no one will be using ever again."** Shifting his gaze to Dex he smiled. **"Even with your ability to fix things that droid is beyond repair. At least here with limited tools. We need to get out of here like Deidra said and now."** Again he used Nayren's cover name just in case.
He looked at the wound that covered much of the Bothan's chest. Looking back to the way they had entered, the darkness remained. He looked at Nayren. His face betrayed no emotion as to the situation. Right now he was calm and in control. **"Going that way will be suicide. Unless you have a better way Tar'ja mentioned a way out down there, probably the best way to go. Get him over to the edge I'll lower him down."**
Moving to the edge where the rope was he looked down. He saw Kasga who was beginning to climb the rope. **"Get off the rope we're coming down."** He yelled down to the pilot. Chase reattached his lightsaber to the front of his belt for easy access. He then began pulling at the liquid cable dispenser that was on his utility belt. Working quickly he started pulling out more than enough length to lower Dex to the bottom. **"Deidra this wont be easy for him. The strain on his wound will be great. Secure it under his arms and I or we can lower him as quickly as possible to Kasga below."** He saw the look on her face. **"It's this or I attempt to lower him to the bottom with the Force like before. It's farther down and will require more effort. The Force is very strong here though and that will help me. We don't have time for a committee.**
OOC:
Ok a lot in this post. So my idea is that Chase lowers Dex by rope or by using the Force like before. Tru I know that Move object isn't a power Chase has but dire times calls for dire actions. It will be a power he takes at the next level with the Feat he gets along with SF: UtF to coincide with him becoming stronger with the Force. Obvious force point/points (if that's even possible) will be used for the attempt if it is tried.

"Bama Osh."
Kasga nods to Tar`ja, then turns for the rope "We will catch up with you two."
As Naryen treats Dexters wound the Bothan starts to breathing steadily now. Still hurt the Bothan manages to stand, his chest no longer smoking he is sure one way or another he will get out of this place.
With the extra rope both Chase and Naryen lower Dexter to Kasga`s waiting arms. The pair glad that the Bothan made it to the bottom and that the smell of burnt Bothan had finally subsided.
"Ken Cass."
Tar`ja follows Jerreb to the edge of the room, where a large entrance meets her. The Bothan uses the wall to brace herself. "This will lead us out, not sure how you and your friends got in here, this is the only entrance I know of."
The tunnel seems to slope upwards and beyond your range of vision. The construction is similar to the tunnel in which your group entered.
"Synyc Starwind."

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

With the extra rope ready, the young Jedi and his former Imperial Officer friend, Prepare Dex for his decent down to Kasga. **"Don't worry Dex we won't drop you."** He said reassuringly as he gave the Bothan a quick nod. He looked to Nayren and nodded once more. **"Ready?"** getting an affirmative from Nayren he quickly and as easily as possible let Dex over the edge holding his rope tight.
Quickly and evenly the two, who would have been enemies mere months ago, worked together to get their friend down safely. **"At least the smell of burnt fur is gone for the moment."** Chase said making a quick joke. The amused look faded when the he felt the weight leave the rope. Hazarding a look down he got a thumbs up from Kasga. He turned and looked at Nayren getting his rope ready for himself. They were in a tight situation and he knew it. **"You first and I'll cover you or we go down together?"** He asked seriously with no false bravado.

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

### **ganthet** (2011-10-19 20:03:58)

Dex looks up at Chase as they lower him down to the next level. "I am not worried. I figure you let me down easy last time, with a rope should be a piece of Spice cake." Looking down at Kasga as he helps get to the ground. "I am going to need a shower and a soak in a bacta tank after this." Dex looks around the area he was in now. Jedi must have believed in minimal comfort cause this place was stone and not much else. "So we have away out?"

<strong> &#8230; segway into dramatic chase musak &#8230; </strong>**.**
Naryen listens to Chases' assessment as she finished up Dexters dressings and helps him to his feet. A quick nod to the Jedi and she sets off with her injured companion to the indicated ledge and rope. Upon arriving Chase begins dispensing cable while talking about an injury he didn't treat. Naryen loops the cabling around Dexters limb-core joints and midsection. ***Does he need to talk to remain focused or did he use his abilities to assess Dexter just then?*** She discards the thought as pointless speculation and nods as she continues to do what Chase was talking about. Her hope rises as she hears him mention another way out and she smiles in spite of their situation.
***"We don't have time for a committee."***
It lances through her focus like a blaster shot. At Chases snipe a flicker of pain washes the smile from her face, like a ripple on a still pond. ***Is that how you see me? A bureaucrat instead of a trained Marine Officer?*** With more effort than she'd have liked she calms her focus and with returned calm and a dismissive shrug she helps Dexter to the ledge: **"It tires you. Hold your ability in reserve, use it if Dex needs it."** Bracing herself against the ledge and to the side she runs cable around her midsection and starts to lower Dexter to Kasga as fast as she dared. She keeps her focus on Dexter as best she can until he's past the point she can see him to make sure she's not exerting too much strain on her injured friend.
She doesn't answer Chase, her breath occupied with the task at hand until she hears a ***"Got him"*** from Kasga and releases the support line. To Chase, a sharp **"Go!"** as draws her weapon, and takes a step towards the tunnel they came in. **"They've got my face on net, they don't need another. I'll follow when you're down. Move!"** With a shake of her burning arms she rallies herself as only her training can allow her diminutive form and stares down the way they came in with focused defiance. ***I'll be the only one you get.*** She thinks about shooting Tash in his arrogant face but that lasts only a moment as her focus drifts to her surroundings. ***No. He's likely just like I was.***
When Chase indicates he's down she holsters her weapon and moves to then down the line faster than she thought possible. A voice from a long dead trooper she fancied echoes in her mind ***Wahoo! Better'n basic! Yeah!*** She hit's the ground running with her weapon back in her hand. An idle commentary from the back of her mind mentions that she didn't recall drawing it again but is drowned out but the rushing adrenal committee.
Catching up to Dexter and Kasga she decides another supporting arm would be more harmful to his wound and chooses instead to shoot at whatever may chase them. **"So, another way out?"**

"Qyn Roeder."
Chase Naryen and Dexter catch up to Tarj`a and Jerreb at the far end of the large oasis room. Tar`ja is helping the Bothan along as they make their way into another tunnel, similar to the tunnel above this one slopes upwards at a gradual incline. "Let`s get going, before the rebellion has to send someone to rescue your group as well." Jerreb comments as she limps into the tunnel.
Entering the tunnel yourselves you notice a fresh breeze drifting through the entire length of the tunnel. It must exit topside, somewhere. judging by the slight incline the tunnel might even end outside the ruined town.
"Torm Arlos." The names continue as the moth like insects flutter about, though the further away you get the harder it is to hear their sorrowful song. Except to Chase whom only needs to listen to the force around him, the song continues in rhythmic beat as the names are played over and over.
After a few rest stops you can see a pale light can be seen breaking the tunnel darkness. Behind your group you once again hear the sound of repulsor engine, this time multiple repulsor engines. Unsure as to the numbers of your pursuers Jerreb motions to the tunnel exit, "We are almost outside. Night will fall soon and with some luck mask our escape."
At the tunnel exit you can see that you are well outside the town limits, in fact nothing of the town is in sight only a barren rocky landscape. About 20 meters from the exit you spot Solen`s repulsor cart on the ground. It appears to have been damaged as smoke rises from the vehicle. On-board the empty cart you notice the tool box has been opened and has several carbon scorch marks on it.

Tar'ja helps the injured Bothan as they make their way slowly to the exit, Not outrightly touching her but offering the support if it were needed and keeping a close eye on her. She willed her mind to not focus on the others, they'd be fine, she knew...or hoped...she wasn't sure which, hoping for someone else, a group of them to make it out was new to her; usually working alone where having to rely on others was simply a waste.
"Rest a moment." she says faintly to the bothan at the sound of exertion. The sound of foot falls however draws her attention quickly, turning her head slightly while her hand moves slowly to her blaster at her side, she was not going to take chances.
But lo...there were the others at last, all of them, with only one looking worse for wear. Raising a hand in greeting, the same that had been about to draw the blaster, she hurries the bothan woman to go again.
The long tunnel was...annoying, but at least the breeze was nice, and soon the light too; but the sound of speeders..that was unwelcome in the amount it sounded in. As they came to the exit the twi'lek poked her head out slightly, just enough to get a view before darting back in.
"The cart's there, there's smoke though, dunno if he's still there or not." She glances to the bothan male "Think you could get the cart running again if he's gone?"

## Re: Rebellion Inquisition

When they caught up with Tar'ja Chase saw for the first time who had been at the bottom hidden in the vegetation. He smiled at Tar'ja as he placed a hand on her shoulder giving her a nod. At the other Bothan's comment about needing another rescue team Chase turned his smile to her. **"That would be quite ironic wouldn't it? We best be going then."** He clipped his lightsaber to his belt and drew his heavy blaster.
The journey up the tunnel was longer than expected. The young Jedi figured that it was taking them some distance from where they were. Maybe even outside the town. The farther he walked the greater the significance of what he was leaving behind became apparent. **"I guess we'll never find out the secrets of that place. It would have been nice to have spent some time there."** He said as he turned slightly to look back from where they had come from.
He continued on foot after foot till he could see a light up ahead and the sound of multiple repulsors could also be heard. Looking out of the tunnels exit his earlier thoughts were confirmed. They were outside the town limits. Solen's cart wasn't far off though it was now smoking and there was no sigh of its owner.
He nodded at Jerreb's comment about using nightfall to escape unnoticed. **"It shouldn't be long like you said. I just hope that Solen is alright."**

Moving with the group, now larger by two, Naryen found a draw to the place they were leaving. The feeling of a joint purpose deferred introductions to later. She considered a feeling of loss as it occurred to her that the local garrison would likely blast it into oblivion. As the arid air reached her senses something else arrived. Burning.
The sight of Solens transport, and it's weapons damage, caused Naryens guts to twist. With no sign of a corpse Naryen spoke quickly **"Pair off and search the area in case they dumped Solens corpse.

Dexter look out the end of the cave. He sees the open baren land scape out in front of him and smoking remains of Solen's speeder truck. "I thought Solen said he wouldn't have any trouble. I guess the local thugs thought they would leave an example of what not to do." Dexter was saddened that another person may have died to help him.

Tar'ja's arm darts out to grab the bothan male quickly "Don't." she says, waiting for him to hold before glancing to the others, helping their target to take a seat "Too dangerous to just go out like this with the light. We need to wait, sunset doesn't look to be too far off, take the time to rest and gather strength."
She spoke in a strong tone, Diedra could take control anytime, she had been allowed to before and it seemed no one wanted the mantle of being a 'leader' save her, but in this...no...this was suicide. More so if their only mechanic of sorts of injured, he'd need the rest if he could work fast enough.
"Dex, the night will be harder to see to the workings if it's needed but it's the better way to escape."
Of them, she knew about escaping under darkness, it was why she was so good at moving under shadows now.
She glanced between them all again and moved slightly towards the exit, on the other side of Jerreb and crouched down, drawing her blaster to keep ready.

Dexter stopped when Tar'ja put her hand on his shoulder. " Your right. Going to make repairing the speeder fun ,but with a glow rod it might be able to be done." He looks over at Jerreb. "So looks like the prize student needed recusing. I can assume that you at least got the mission completed before they shot you." Dex didn't mean to sound mean to her, but she was a pain in the Acadmey and she was a pain on missions. He takes a seat close enough to her to not have to shout and far enough to move before a rock bounced off his head. He closes his eyes and rests. The wound on his chest was tender and hurt like the blazes, but it could have been worse. "Your going to have contact The bosses back home. They seemed to be worried about you."

Naryen found herself rather taken aback by Tar'jas behaviour. ***Did she not hear the blaster fire or see Dexters wound? How does she think that happened? A person could have commed before attacking us.*** She glares at Chase as she suppresses a flare of irritation so that it doesn't show in her voice. Pitching it so everyone in the immediate area can hear she keeps her tone studiously diplomatic. ***No time for a committee but you do like setting a precedence for one don't you Jedi.***
**"Dexter was shot by a remote that won't be following us but was likely live transmitting."** Turning to face Tar'ja she adjusts her volume for more casual discourse with the Twi'lek. **"I know you've had experience with them before."** A pause to let Tar'ja recall that Naryen herself was once on the other end of a remote pursuing the purple woman. **"I expect a response will arrive well before night fall."** She emphasizes "response" to lead back to the definition she had spoken of just a moment earlier (((OOC last post.))) and Tar'jas own experience on Varbrindal.
Looking around her again then back to Tar'ja. **"A search perimeter can become a defense perimeter and that"** a nod and glance in the direction of Solens cart **"is the only ride I know of."** She faces Tar'ja with an calm expression.
Naryen furrows her brow for an instant then pitches her voice back to group level: **"Unless our new companions have means I'm not aware of."** She looks at each of them with a cordial nod and an open expression. ***Really. Speak up. Please.***

Dexter eyes open at the sound of Naryen discussing something with Tar'ja. Which with Naryen it was a bit more like arguing. " Naryen, she is right. As you said they may come before night fall, but they may let the planet do there work for them." He takes a deep breath fighting back some pain. "Besides two of our number are injured and walking into the open would just be making targets of ourselves. We can secure here and wait for darkness and then move." Naryen was just doing what she thought was right and trying to protect the team. But sometimes she was a little less diplomatic then others may liked. "My lady please let's rest and move when it is safer." he gives here his most reassuring smile.

The squabbling was beginning to start again. He let out a sigh as he listened to the others talk and finishing with Dex trying to calm Nayren down. ***Nice effort Dex but with that woman if she has her mind set to something you're better off dealing with a Rancor.*** He thought. But the thought turned sobering as that line of thinking could also be used in reference to him.
He looked at Nayren as the realization washed over him. Opening his mouth his voice was even and controlled as only a Jedi's could be. **"Look if you want to lead this troupe then do it. You're more then capable but you titter-totter some when doing it. I'm tired of the squabbling that's been plaguing us lately.

The look on his face and tone in his voice was sincere. Something had to be done with the leadership among them. He knew that she would never follow him. Might as well let her do what she was trained to do. ***I'm probably going to catch hell for this.*** He thought. ***So be it.***

Tar'ja's covered head swiviled sharply to Deirda at the mention of what it was that had attacked.
That was what that sound was? the damn thing hadn't gotten the chance to fire on her when she first came upon one so...how would she know what it sounded like? In any case she knew how to deal with those at least...they may know that they were on the planet but Dex had a good point, there's many solutions that an enemy may take.
Her gaze narrows at the tone of voice her spirit sister was taking with her.
"So you want us to go outside, in the light, to a speeder sitting likely dead with the driver's location and status unknown it what is more likely a trap than the room we were just in, because of a droid that's disabled that might have transmitted back to a ship in orbit where the next action is either following immediately or waiting until the planet takes care of things, or said speeder trap is sprung." she motions to the cavern where they came from and the speeder in their own turns.
"You may have some death wish or something to prove but I don't. I'm not about to do something that every instinct and training I've ever had screams not to, I'm not still alive by not listening to that." She motions to the speeder "By all means, go out in the open where anyone could see you to follow through on your 'plan' I will be here, waiting until there are enough shadows to give cover."
She stands and looks towards Chase, the hood covering her expression, thankfully, it wouldn't do to show how angry the woman had just made her with such a foolish idea of escape, honestly, what the hell did Imperials teach their soldiers? to run out and get killed? shit.
"Chase, can you feel anything out there." it was half a question half an order to check, her gaze/hooded head turned towards Deidra, if there was ever a moment of challenge that was it; she had been taught to use all around yourself if survival was going to be possible; their greatest asset at the moment was a jedi who could sense things without them having to go outside in the open.

The left eyebrow on the young Jedi's face rose as he felt the rising emotion coming from Tar'ja. The way she had been spoken to by Nayren had set something off within the Twi'lek woman. He let his eyebrow fall as Tar'ja spoke about how going out there was against her natural instinct and training. He agreed but knew enough to keep quiet. It seemed that whenever he expressed an opinion it only served to get Nayren riled up at him and his impetuous Jedi ways. ***"We're falling apart here.*** He thought to himslef.
At her strongly toned question he nodded. **"One moment."** With practiced ease he looked out to the cart and surroundings not only with his eyes but with the Force as well. What would be hidden by rocks and sand would not be hidden from the Force since he could feel the presence of life if it was intermingled with the surroundings.

Tar`ja and Jerreb are the first to the entrance which marks your groups exit from the under ground oasis. Jerreb puts a hand against the wall for support. At the mention of "solen." Her ears fold back as she listens to your group as you plan your next move. When Dexter inquires as to the state of her mission Jerreb replies "Of course I did, don`t I always." The last part was more of a statement then a question.
"But with every mission I must report back to Runn. I have obtained important information which the rebellion desperately needs and now it seems that you and your group have .... unknowingly brought the very bounty hunter who had chased me to this dung heap to my heels." Jerreb spits on the ground as she curses the name "Solen." ears still pinned back the Bothan operative is obviously upset.
Chase reaches out with his feelings closing his eyes when he does so. Reaching further and further out the jedi attempts to find any kind of disturbance in the force.
Jerreb continues "Your group argues too much, not sure how you all made it this far. Did you at least bring a ship? We need to get off this planet, and that cart looks like a trap."
Chase senses something cold closing in, unsure of what to make of it the jedi continues to reach out. Not something cold but many.

That her suggestions would once again bring such reactions, Naryen found herself confused and dismayed. She stares at Tar'ja with a little hopelessness creeping into her features. ***I wasn't suggesting that Dexter bolts out without cover! I said perimeter! Do you all think I meant blindfolded and at the same time? Do you all need explicit written instructions filed in triplicate to do what you each do best!? You're not troopers for fraks sake!*** These thoughts and more swirled and grew from coils of rage pulling at her senses and she struggles for clarity as Chase once again berates her and this time in front of even more people. She had just been shot at and thought she saw a friend get killed in front of her. Did they really all think she was *that* reckless?
As she stood there taking the three pronged attack, like a good soldier, she recalled how lucky she was with the drone. ***Ok, a little reckless.***
Once Chase had again delivered a sermon to her he seemed content leave Naryen be and follow Tar'jas suggestion to ... tune in?
Listening to the Bothans banter it became clear that the woman was not impressed with their group and was who they came here to retrieve. Not having a means of getting to their ship stood out as the bothan woman agreed that Solens cart was bait for a trap or a trap itself. She focused on her. ***Bounty hunter? Could those remotes not be Imperial then?***
**"Solen offered his skills as local guide and brought us here. Please tell us of your dealings with him."** She tried to split her attention equally between ... Jerreb was it? and the sounds of more drones about to surge up the tunnel after them blasters no doubt blazing.

As he reached out with the Force the voices of the others quiet some. He can still hear them and the conversation they are having. He doesn't miss Jerreb's comment about Solen.
Pushing his senses out farther he begins to feel something. A coldness coming closer. Focusing more on it he gains a bit of clarity. It wasn't one thing that was closing in but many. ***Great out of the pan…*** He opened his eyes as the thought ran through his head. His Force senses still reaching out from him.
**"Excuse me for butting in."** He said to Jerren and Nayren as he felt that his information was important. **"Something is coming. A sense that many are moving our way. I'll try and find out from where. Weather from behind us or from out there."** He gestured out to Solen's cart with his blaster.
Still calm he picked up from where he was trying to determine a direction from where the many the made up the coldness were coming from.

Dexter looks at the others. Still arguing who was calling the shots. And Naryen still hateing Chase for some reason. It all boggled his mind as to why these people could not function as a team. *"This is why I worked alone all that time."* he thinks to himself. He closes his eyes and waits for someone to tell him the plan. As far a he was conserved he was the group tech and information center. Out here his skills where worthless. Jerreb was right they were going to all get killed if they did stop arguing about everything. Also the news of Solen was interesting he didn't know how he missed that about the man. If it was true they had better avoid any other locals and get to the ship and burn sky until they saw lines. This place just became more hostile them it was. He continues to rests recovering what strength he could. He also keeps his hold out ready. Just incase.

A cool breeze blows through the tunnel entrance as the planet begins to transition from day to night. On the horizon the sun begins to set spraying hues of yellow, orange and red across the landscape. In the distance a single howl breaks the silence marking the sun`s decent into night. Soon night will fall leaving your group immersed in darkness.
Jerreb ignores Naryen`s question looking directly into the former imperials eyes before turning to scan the area. Her ears perked upwards now in full attention to her current duty. Scanning the cart first then the area around the Bothan seems to be looking for signs of a trap. The view from the tunnel entrance allows only a limited perspective of the are directly in front of your group. Obscured from your vision, anything outside and behind your group as well as anything above the entrance as the tunnel entrance is little more then a hole in the side of a hill.
As Chase mentions something cold Jerreb agrees with a nod, speaking now in a more hushed tone she replies "He is probably right, I see nothing out there but this does not feel right."
As if to emphasize her point Kasga whispers, "behind us." Pointing down the tunnel where your group came through the Duro`s has identified several lights scanning back and forth. Unfortunately it is unclear how far down the tunnel the lights are, though you do still hear the slight hum of the repulsor engines.

Tar'ja glares at the swaying lights behind them and the apparent trap before them. Which would be the lesser of two evils? Risk getting caught and taken in? Granted they might be able to hold them off but their backs wouldn't be covered, so the cart then...
"You are certain you do not feel any forms outside the cave?" she asks of the Jedi edging to the mouth of the cave. The top would be a great place to wait to spring a trap if it had a place to sit on..if it was flat that would be a different story. "Seems we have no choice but to move out there." She glances to Diedra from under her hood then back to the mouth of the cave. "Damn..we should prepare ourselves then for a trap to spring."

There they were, just as the former Imperial said they'd be. Mechanical death rising after them, likely not impeded by darkness and out there, more weapons controlled by a bounty hunter trained on the... cart.
Naryen looked at the cart, at the damage done and it's placement. No sign of Solen or other struggle, recently inflicted since it's still smoldering. ***The odds of him having his cart where the bounty hunter needed it: placed just such to be covered by someone on the hill above us. Either the bounty hunter placed it or …*** 
Naryen turns back to Jerreb with wider eyes, like she couldn't quite absorb the words coming out of her own mouth.

Chase looked at Tar'ja and nodded. **"Something is definitely coming up behind us. Out there,"** He gestured with his blaster. **"Isn't as clear but right now I can't sense anything out of the ordinary."**
He paused as he looked back and forth between Jerreb, Nayren, and Tar'ja. The three women seemed to be in a power struggle. One thing that he noticed was the Bothans ability to not answer a direct question about Solen. One that Nayren has asked twice now.
**"We can't stay here any longer. If we're going to make our move we need to do it and do it quick."** There was a sense of urgency to his tone like when Garet used to tell him to make up his mind. When a Jedi used a tone like that sitting still wasn't an option. His words were backed up by Kasga pointing buying them as lights and the sound of a repulsor could be heard.
**"That cart weather a trap of not is our only way out of here. We'll just have to outsmart the ambushes if it comes to that. Are we all ready?"** He said as he removed his lightsaber from his belt and held it in his free hand. It remained un activated but ready to spring to life to deflect shot that may come at them.

Dexter sits resting. Half listening to what the others are saying. Chase wants to move out soon. Naryen worries about the droids coming after them. Tar'ja says caution. Everyone arguing about what to do, and no one saying what to do. Kind of reminded him of when he first started out after the acadmy. He rises and checks his blaster and what is left of his tunic and robes. "Well if no one objects I will check out the cart and see if there is anyone waiting for us." If he stuck to the shadows and moved from what little cover there was he may make it. " Jerreb has to gotten out of here and arguing is not making that happen. So I am going and will signal you if there is anything." With that he readies himself and starts on his way sticking to what cover he can find and using the shadows to mask his movements.

Tar'ja nodded her head, this was why she had planned for darkness it was the only way she knew that at the least she could move out there to look around safely and turn an ambush around to those that wanted to harm them.
Crouching low along the wall she looks around outside once more, spotting a growing patch of shadows outside along the cave she shifts slowly towards it, keeping low to disappear, as it were, into the patch. Now she could move and look around to give them a better idea what was outside.

Behind your group down the tunnel the lights continue to sway back and forth resemblance of a search pattern. You hear no foot steps, no chatter of a group of individuals but instead you hear the pulsing waves emitted from repulsor engines. Kasga stands staring into the darkness while the group considers the next step, "I count 6. They look to be moving in pairs side by side with more behind. I can not tell how far they are." The Duros speaks in a hushed tone.
Jerreb nods to Naryen`s question. "One of them got a lucky shot on my. He tracked me to a public transport, when he confronted me I managed to escape aboard an escape pod. He seems to be good at his job because he was on me again when I landed on this dust ball." The Bothan woman holds on to her blaster looking out towards the cart.
Dexter starts out for the cart, Jerreb shakes her head then sighs. "Not like we have many options I guess." Then she readies her blaster leveling it to cover her former class mate. under her breath everyone hears her say "may the force be with you."
Kasga moves to the side of the cave, leveling his blaster to the rear. "Not sure how this will work out but I will cover the rear."
Behind your group the sound of repulsor engines nears, it will not be long before they are upon you. Ahead of you Dexter slinks along edging closer and closer to the cart, using brush and rock for meager cover.

Naryen stares at Jerreb as the Bothan woman nods in answer to her question, though more specifically she stares into herself. Tendrils of doubt, from the demise of her world and her feelings of helplessness, curl after her confidence like a predator on the heat. She let a friendly face get to her. She thought she was expecting that, given her new perspective on her past.
Perhaps she thought wrong. ***You are a special kind of gullible fool Naryen Fae.***
Naryen moves to the edge of the cave, low and tight, along the cave/tunnel wall and watches Dexter step out with little cover. She looks around and takes the same tactic as Jerreb to cover her wounded friend. (((OOC - aid another there, hold initiative, purple monkey pimp playa, whatever.)))
At Chases question she whispers back. **"When the drones come at us anything to the tunnel ceiling ahead of them, sure."**

Chase watched as the others moved from their position of cover to the cart that may or my not be a trap. ***This ought to be interesting.*** He thought as he looked at Kasga who mentioned covering their potentially very exposed backs.
Taking a step to the Duros He laid a hand on the pilots shoulder. **"Don't stay too long. We'll cover you when you come to us if need be."** He reached into one of his pouches and removed a spare blaster power pack and handed it over. **"Here. Maybe you can rig something as a surprise. Look…"** He paused for a second. **"…I know you have your doubts about what I an do but like Jerreb just said, May the Force be with you. We're going to need all the help we can get."**
With that said he patted the pilots shoulder once and started to follow the path the others took. With both his weapons ready, thought the lightsaber was still unlit, he was ready for whatever may be waiting for them. ***May the Force be with us this day.***

Dexter slinks even closer to the cart, still no sign of movement, ambush or anything. Tar`ja also steps out of the cavern followed shortly after by Chase while Naryen stays to cover Jerreb. Kasga stands to the side of the entrance facing into the tunnel.
The sound of repulsor engines grows nearer, as do the lights swaying back and forth in their search pattern. The caverns darkness is briefly illuminated by the flash of Kasga`s blaster as he snaps off a shoot "They are here." Six lights move towards your group attached to six sphere shaped droids floating a meter off the ground. There is a small burst of sparks as the lead droid takes a hit from Kasga`s shot, it continues forward.
Dexter hears the shot fired looks back and but can only barely make out the six droids assaulting his friends inside the tunnel. Off in the distance Dexter can see lines of dust created in the wake of vehicles as they pass through the terrain. They are coming in your direction.

They weren't going to have much time if the speeder took long to get up and running...."Hurry Dex, we don't have a large window here.." She keeps her gaze around them, last thing they needed was to be caught by surprise. Her hand flexs about her blaster.

Dexter doesn't need to be told twice. He quickly moves to the speeder and starts to work. Holstering his blaster, and pulling out his tool kit and a glow stick to work by. " Always rush, rush with you people never get to take my time and do a proper job." The galaxy was trying to kill him again. It was something he was gettting strangely used to.
When he reaches the speeder he find a good place to start, that will also work as good cover. He had been shot once today and that was enough for him. He looks toward he thought Tar'ja was. "Keep me covered if you can. My your aim be true, and your reflexes swift." He starts to work. Thinking to himself. *"My fortune be with us cause the galaxy sure ain't."*
((OOC: Moving to the speeder. putting away blaster and take out tool kit and glow rod. When I reach the speeder need to find a some cover and start working. Mechcanics check + 14. Let me know if you need anything else.))

Chase followed behind Tar'ja keeping several meters back from her. He didn't want to be so close that his own not stealthy approach didn't hinder her much. He watched the surroundings and her as she moved. Each step was calculated and precise when placed. It was as if it was a graceful dance the way she moved ahead of him. Her body moved fluidly over the terrain. ***This isn't the time to admire the view.*** He admonished himself as he dragged his eyes away from the sight in front of him as he began to look around again only to look behind when he heard Kasga's blaster fire.
Moving his head from left to right he began looking for some cover. A vantage point where he could cover Ganth and Tar'ja at the cart while keeping eyes on the cave opening. He looked at Tar'ja quickly. **"If anyone out here is waiting for us they know we're here now."**
OOC:
Perception +9 to find some cover and or anyone ready to ambush us.
Will hold action for attacking and attack if the enemy presents him/her/its-self

<strong> &#8230; And it begins &#8230; </strong>**.**
As Naryen surveys the area, and the people in it, her own words and thoughts repeat back to her as she realizes that she didn't think to ask Chase for a report on the drones nor did he volunteer one.
***…anything to the tunnel ceiling…***
She looks back and up at the tunnel ceiling.
***If the drones are carrying explosives…***
With wider eyes she repositions to help Kasga and joins him in firing on the drones.
**"We need to get out of the tunnel. It could be rigged!"**
***You are a special kind of fool Naryen Fae.***

Kasga fires again his blast once again illuminating the tunnel briefly revealing the six spherical droids. The shoot goes wild impacting into the tunnel wall. The droids turn all pointing out targets of their own.
Dexter reaches the cart scanning the vehicle he frowns as he comes to the realization that the only cover available is the cart itself. Mostly an open cockpit speeder, it sports a wind faring, two seats and an now open and empty large tool box. The rest of the speeder is a flat bed on the back for hauling cargo. A quick look over the speeder controls Dexter can see no damage of any kind. Trying the starter again the Bothan frowns as it fails to initiate.
Naryen moves to assist Kasaga fight off the droids. Pulling on the trigger her imperial basic training takes over her shoot hits the closest droid`s spherical frame. The droid jerks to the side in mid air then falls to the ground with a thump. Now only five droids remain.
Chase stops as he hears the blaster fire, looking back he can see Jerreb, Kasga and Naryen all fighting off more droids in the tunnel. Above the tunnel the landscape hills over and continues onto the horizon. In the distance he can see can see lines of dust created in the wake of vehicles as they pass through the terrain. They are coming in your direction.
Jerreb kneels partly for cover and partly due to her injuries. Using both hands to steady her aim she pulls off a shoot at the attacking droids. Her shoot slams into another droids, it too falls to the ground in a heap of wreaked metal.
(Holding off in case Yogi wants to change direction/attack or something else.
Int Kasga 24 already went, Dexter 23, Naryen 21, Chase 19, Jerreb 18, Droids 12, Tar`ja 10)

<strong> &#8230; and continues &#8230; </strong>**.**
Rallied by her success, so far, Naryen continues to aid Kasga with the much more present threat from the attack drones bearing down on their position. With little in the way of cover, or firepower, she uses whatever she can to the best of her abilities. Soon other threats will be upon them so these drones could be that which ends them all.
Crouching with readied weapon she quotes a passage from an Imperial history of war tome **"We have been out maneuvered though we are not yet done."** Naryen squeezes the trigger on her officers pistol, again firing into the darkness at the lights of death that approach.

Dexter curses at the lack of cover. A quick scan of the controls show him no sign of damage. He tries the starter. Nothing. "Damn!" He says to no one near by. He moves to the engine compartment to see if it may have been disabled. "Tar'ja this may take longer then we thought. Also it may have been a clever trap. Keep an exit open." Dexter opens the engine cover and starts his inspection.
((OOC: Checking the engine over to see what is wrong or may have been rigged to not let it start or blow up. Search check +4, Mechanics Check +15.))

Tar'ja continued to sneak after the bothan, covering his back to keep him safe,as he was the only one of them with some idea on how to fix the damn machine. "How long?" she asks a bit behind him, crouched low in the growing shadows, scanning the horizon and the mountain face, she'd keep an exit back to the caves open but she didn't know how long that exit would be a good one.
"Can you fix it?" she asks.
*Stealth +15, ready weapon*

Chase looked behind him as he heard the blaster fire erupt from his friends behind him in hopes of stalling the advance of their droid followers. Between The droids, the cart and the dust in the distance they were in trouble. Those that were coming In the distance would have to be dealt with if they got out of this mess.
Deciding on what to do, mostly in part do to Tar'ja going to help Dex, the young Jedi moved several steps closer to the cave entrance where he could fire on the coming droids. Raising his blaster he looked down his sights and fired.
**"There's dust trails coming our way. It won't be long till they are here."** He said to Nayren as he sighted in again and let loose with another shot.
OOC:
Using my delayed action from the last round to shoot.
Then in this round he will shoot again.
Hvy Blaster Pistol +7 (3d8+2) Delayed action.
Hvy Blaster Pistol +8 (3d8+2) current action with an aim action.

Smiling at Tar'ja's comment. "Well as soon as I figure out what is wrong with it I will let you know." Dex keeps looking over the craft to find out the problem and what he needs to do. "Also my dear please remember that his maybe a clever trap and we may need to run away very fast." Dexter was thinking that this could be a trap. There wasn't anything about this situation that seemed the it was supposed to seem.
