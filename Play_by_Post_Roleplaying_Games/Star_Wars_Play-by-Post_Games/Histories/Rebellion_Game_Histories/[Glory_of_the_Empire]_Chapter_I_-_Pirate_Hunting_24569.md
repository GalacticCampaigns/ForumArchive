# [Glory of the Empire] Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-24 10:04:05)

*This is the moment you have all been waiting for. All your training at the Academy will now be put to the test. For months now, a pirate band has been striking at Imperial settlements and trade convoys around the Oricho and Lahara sectors. Imperial Intelligence has traced the origin of these pirate raids to the Vahaba asteroid belt, and probe droids have discovered a base hidden inside one of the larger asteroids. While the sectors are small, and mainly populated by non-humans, the local Moff has declared that such acts of piracy is unacceptable, and to be punished severely. As such, a platoon pf the 118th legion has been dispatched to administer Imperial justice.* 
With nothing but the hum of the hyperdrive, and the scattered chatter of soldiers bunked together to break the silence, it is a wonder you manages to stay awake. Supposedly, it is only because of the thrill of being on your first actual assignment in service of the Empire that isn´t just another drill. Oh, and maybe the fact that the ship may drop hyperspace at any time, and you might need to be at full alert. Anyway, the stiffness and weight of the armor have since long become just a minor nuisance, as you´ve been on higher alert ever since the ship hit hyperspace.
You expect that your journey will soon be at an end, and as a confirmation of that, Lieutenant Jason Nates enters the main hold of the ship, an Imperial *Gamma*-class Assault Shuttle. As expected, you snap into alert at the approach of a senior officer. In this case, one could guess it was as much out of respect as out of duty. Lt Nates had just been pulled out of active field duty, after having been one of the finest soldiers in the 118th. With a hand motion, he allowed you all to stand at ease. He wore the uniform of an imperial officer, and his face was as clean-shaven as ever.
“Alright men, the time you have been waiting for is here. In a matter of minutes, we will drop hyperspace just outside the Vahaba belt, and our pilots will bring us in on the pirate base. This shuttle is not armed with any kind of cloaking equipment, and our approach will be slow due to the asteroids, so be prepared that we might come under attack. Its shields are powerful though, and it should have no trouble bringing us to our target”
He takes a moment to look over the troops.
“If there are no questions, then ready yourself”
((In case anyone had any doubts about it, you guys make up Theta squad))

Beksus stared down at his helmet which was held in his two hands, the emotionless white exterior which he woud soon become part of him. The journey to this day had been a long, frustrating one. Especially through training where the trainers' eyes seemed to glare into him at any excuse, and sometimes without one. He raised his head and looked around one last time before donning the helmet. He'd worn it before but now it felt somewhat complete, as if he'd finally completed training and was now a stormtrooper. Red then took his E11 and loaded it, quickly looking down the sights as a last minute check. He took a deep breath and nodded at the Liuetenant, "Do you want us to blow the place up or just kill everyone inside?" he asked not entirely seriously.

Duo sat at the ready. For moments at a time, he would close his eyes and mind to the actions of those around him as he acquired what rest he could on the ship's Hyperspace jump. Although his squad mates knew him to be a clone, he preferred to not remind them so openly. As such, his helmet remained on during the flight.
With his rifle laying in wait on his lap, he meditated on the operation about to commence. He fought back the resentment of such an assignment. *Dealing with pirates was not the job of trained soldiers, that should be reserved for a planetary security force. My place is on the battlefield, like my brothers before me, battling armies, not bands.* But even as his arrogance demanded a real assignment, his humility and sense of duty recognized that he had not proved himself worthy. That this was the first of many tests toward the field of real battle.
As the sound of the cabin door reached his ear, his eyes darted in it's direction. The lieutenant had entered, and as such, the squad acknowledged. His words were brief and to the point. A trait Duo could respect. Checking his rifle once more, he now stood at the ready.

"Can the Chatter, 1886." Solvar replies. The corporal, looked over at the others in his squad, doing his best to keep order to the Sergeant didn't have to step on anyone. Spending the time making minor adjustments to his Stormtrooper-1, which really was a carbon copy of the Blastech E-11 it was commonly mistaken for.

Once the LT was done and told everyone to get ready, Kirnos smirked a little when the Corporal chastised Red for asking a simple question, then went to wiping his Stormtrooper-1 down one more time, trying to clear his thoughts. "Easy, Corporal," Kirnos said to lighten the mood alittle, even though it might draw the Corporal's ire to him. "He's curious about what's the plan to take on these scum, Corporal."
Satisified that the carbine was cleaned enough, Kirnos leaned back a little, thinking about his time as a refugee, mechanic, and general merc on the Force-forsaken, back-water planet that he called home. If it wasn't for those mercs and missionaries, he'd be a slave or worse. Thankfully, that didn't happen and he can do something about the lawlessness in the galaxy.

Once the LT finishes describing the assignement, Eldred put on his helmet and Armed his rifle. The only thought going trough his head at that point was this. Those lawless scum will get what they deserve soon enough, I'll show them how to respect the empire.
He then stood at the ready, waiting for a more precise asignement for the squad.
He glared trough his helmet at Kirnos, did the man had no sense of order ? Eldred hoped the corporal would deal with him later.

Kirt regards the bickering of his squad members with quiet disdain. Stormtroopers have to be disciplined. To most of the galaxy, they are the face of the Empire, their clean white armor and the chorus of their thunderous marching footsteps embodying Imperial order and power. To act in an undisciplined or undignified way would lose the respect of Imperial citizens and lawless scum alike, and would be doing a disservice to the Emperor himself. But Kirt keeps quiet, and pulls his helmet on over his head, staying out of it. It isn't worth the trouble.
Instead, he focuses on his mission. He had heard that the sectors these pirates are raiding are primarily non-human, and it would normally make him wonder why they're even wasting their time. It isn't his place to question the Moff's orders, however, and it'll be a good opportunity for him and the rest of his squad to get some field experience. Besides, maybe a suitable display of power will remind the alien vermin here what would happen should they ever rebel, and what their place in the galaxy is: Under the boot of human superiority.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-25 21:07:43)

If the lieutenant was bothered by the chatter in Theta squad, he didn´t show it, either visibly or audibly. Perhaps he didn´t mind, or was certain that the respective squad leaders would handle it. After making sure the orders had been understood by the platoon, he returned to the cockpit.
As expected, moments later the shuttle drops out of hyperspace, and you can all feel the shift in piloting style. You realizes that the shuttle have entered the asteroid field, but so far you seem to be untroubled by the pirates. The occasional rocking of the ship you attribute to the random minor asteroid fragments bound to float around in the field smashing against the shuttle´s shields.
After some minutes of sublight flight, Nates reappears in the main hold.
"Alright men, listen up. So far, we´ve encountered no trace of the pirates, except visual confirmation of the location of their base. This could mean one of two things. One, the base might be abandoned, and we need to cut some heads in intelligencee. Or two, the far more likely option, we´ll have an ambush on our hands. Sensors shows no starfighter activity in the field, meaning they´re likely barricaed inside their base, waiting for us to come to them. A foolish mistake"
The lieutenant pauses and turns to one side of the ship.
"Alpha, Epsilon squads, upon landing, I want you to depart the ship through the side hatches, spreading out on both sides through the hangar deck. Primary objective, seizing control of the hangar doors, allowing us to control any further engagements in there"
He turns back to look at Sharez, and the rest of the men on that side of the ship.
"Theta squad, you deploy after them and offer fire support in case of an engagement. Otherwise, your primary objective will be securing and establishing a defensive position outside the hangar. Beta, once the hangar has been cleared, it will be your task to secure it and keep our road out of here clear"
Giving the entire platoon a stern look, and - as if to emphasize the reality of the situation - the ship rocked heavily.
"ETA 30 seconds, prepare for battle soldiers"

Kirnos immediately put the cloth away, double checking his seals and whoever was next him. *Even though it won't do if we have a breach*, he thought grimly, *it'll do if the pirates have some nasty stuff.*
Done with checking over the armor, Kirnos held his blaster at ready, anxious to get his first engagement over with.

Duo became excited as the ship came out of hyperspace. The rush of battle drew near, and he didn't want to miss his chance. His anxiety lessened a bit, as the approach appeared to be a bit too calm. Still, with one hand on his rifle and one on the hull of the ship, he steadied himself of what the vehicle's inertia dampeners didn't, as the pilot navigated the asteroid field. As the Lieutenant's thirty second warning came, he and the trooper next to him shared a look. He believed it to be Kirnos, but he wasn't certain as the only two troopers with any distinguishing mark on their armor were the Sergeant and Corporal. He nodded at the trooper, to signify that he too was ready, and that they'd soon face this battle together.

Sovar switch over to they're squad channel of the helmet comlink network. "You heard the LT, If its not wearing white, Shoot it."
The Corporal was strangely calm at the moment, confident in his abilities and those of his companions.

When the ship rocked, Kirt felt the adrenaline start to pump through his veins, though he maintained his calm exterior. He inspected the condition of his pistol, checked the power, and holstered it, then went through the same routine with his rifle, making sure it was clean and that the power pack was loaded in there securely.
Then, he put his rifle away, and twisted his head slightly to the side, eliciting an audible pop from his neck. He proceeded to make a fist with each hand in turn, placing it in the other hand and cracking his knuckles. Time to bust some heads.

Now that they were nearing their destination and that their orders where clear, Eldred was getting nervous. What if he lost pressure in his armor ? What if he caught a crossfire shot ? Or worse yet, what if he got one of his guts feeling ?
He'd have to rely on the others as much as he relied on him.
He switched to the Squad channel in answer to the Corporal
"Yes Sir" was all he said.

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-28 10:00:51)

You can all feel the ship slowing down, and a last shudder in the hull tells you that the ship must have just passed through the force field and into the hangar. In a few moments, the ship lowers itself towards the hangar deck, and you can hear the clasps of the side hatches release. With military reaction speed, Alpha and Epsilon squads pops the hatches open, flowing out of the ship like a white river. Forming up in two semi-circles, the squads advances away from the ship, and the soldiers of Theta squad disembarks as ordered.
The hangar bay is quite large, and pretty much what you´d expect from a pirate crew. lining the walls are a bunch of varied starfighters, consisting of a few Z-95 Headhunters, a Y-Wing, two Cloakshape fighters, and a Skipray Blastboat. The place is kind of a mess, with ammunition crates standing about both here and there, and patches of greasy fluids - engine coolant or something similar - spread over the floor. At the far end of the hangar, you can see the door leading out of the hangar, as well as a window into what has to be the control room. From the hangar deck, a wide ramp runs in a zig-zag fashion up to a higher floor by the door. Scattered about in the bends of the ramp, cargo crates of various sizes and colors are found.
As you observes hangar, you suddenly hears a cry form the left.
"Watch out!"
Followed by the sound of blasterfire you can barely turn your heads fast enough to see a hail of red bolts rain down upon your brothers of Epsilon squad, two of them falling to the ground with smoking holes in their armor. On th other side of the hangar, a similar fate befalls Alpha as a red energy lance catches one of its soldiers square in the face. Behind the cargo crates stacked on the path to the exit, you count to seven hostiles - Weequay, you reckon - armed with blasters.
((OK, battle´s on. I don´t require you to post in Initiative order, so I won´t bother posting it, I´ll just fill things in when they come. Your squad have just dropped from the ship, so you are all considered to have cover from it. Oh, and please tell me whether you have your stock extended or folded, just so I know))

"Covering Fire!" Solvar calls out, as he drops out of the assault shuttle, switching his blaster over to autofire, he lets out his own stream of blaster bolts to those on his left.
(Swift: Switch to autofire
Move: Move to cover (If there some I can reach in a single move)
Attack: Autofire +2 (3d8+1) )

Kirnos barely let out a swear before hitting the ground, his carbine's stock unfolded as he hits the ground. When the Corporal called for cover, instincts took as he grabbed some cover and sighted on one of the pirates taking fire from the Corporal.
*Blasting with out taking into consideration for our brothers might get some killed, Corporal*, he thought as he fired.
(Move Action: Move to get some cover [at least 2 squares from starting position])
(Standard Action: Ranged attack @ +7 (3d8+4))

Eldred was tempted to simply throw his frag grenade behind the crates to blow the scums to bitts but seeing the leaking fluid on the floor he judged that it would probably be a bad idea. Instead he let go a shot of brilliant scarlet toward them as he rushed for cover.
((Standard action: ranged attack +5 (3d8+1), move action : move toward cover if possible))

### **Parmenter** (2010-01-29 23:31:21)

Exiting the drop-ship behind Kirnos, Duo took the briefest second to take in the hangar. The pirates had the squads pretty well boxed in, with teams on the left, right and front. Should one of the lines be broken, the hangar would easily fall into their hands. Theta squads assignment was the team of pirates blocking the exit. The corporal was laying down covering fire, while the rest of the squad exited the ship and fell into position. So far, everything was working by the book. Still, the line needed to be broken. With his weapon still compacted, Duo followed Kirnos. As Kirnos fired, Duo laid down a barrage of fire along the same trajectory.
*Actions:* Where ever Kirnos was ending up, Duo will be with him. And firing at an adjacent pirate to his target, +6 (No penalty at point blank, or short range. - *Riflemaster*)

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-31 18:52:37)

With the ambush obvious, Sharez quickly drops from the ship, and snaps the stock out on his rifle and fires a rapid volley of shots against the closest pair of attackers. The hail of blasterfire rains mercilessly down upon their cover, and it seems that one of the crates was containing something explosive, as it suddenly bursts into flames, killing the two pirates taking cover behind it. *Critical Hit*
Coming up behind Sharez, Kirt raises his rifle as well, putting away a series of blaster bolts causing one of the pirates to pull his head down.
As Solvar drops from the ship, he quickly scans around for close cover, but seeing as none was within the immediate distance, he remained in the cover of the ship. Calling out an order for suppressive fire, he releases a rapid spray of blaster bolts against the attackers. Holding a rifle in control without an extended stock is difficult however, and the bolts splatters harmlessly against the cargo crates.
On the other side of the ship, Duo and Kirnos drops down. Seeing potential cover from either some of the starfighters, or a close stand of munition crates, Kirnos sprints out into the open, Duo close behind, and they both open fire. Without proper support from the stock, Duos shot goes wide, splashing into the ceiling. Kirnos has better luck, and his shot nails a Weequay square between the eyes, dropping it instantly.
Following suit behind Kirt, Marcus and Beksus fires away at the remaining pirates, trying to force them deeper into cover.
Bought some reprieve by Theta, Epsilon squad seems to have recovered from the initial shock, and advances on the enemy. Spreading out, they tries to keep a low profile as they heads for the bottom of the walkway.
Blasting out of the ship for cover, Eldred pauses only briefly to fire a volley at the ambushers, and the red energy lance misses the pirate by mere centimeters, causing a loud roar in whatever tongue Weequay speaks. The pirate lines up his own blaster to return the fire, but his shot misses Eldred by a wide margin.
Seeing their own fall, and the white-armored troopers advance on their positions, the thugs unleashes a volley of blasterfire upon Epsilon squad, and another soldier falls.
Regrouping, Alpha launches a coordinated attack against the three thug barricaded at the top of the walkway and sends them diving for cover, one of them not coming up again.
((OK, round one is over. Check OOC for some clarifications))

Marcus lets out a low, barely audible curse, finally snapping out of his trance-like state and coming fully to the present. *Geez, the heck happened while I was sleep-walking?* he thought to himself as he unfolded the stock to his rifle and took aim at one of the pirates.
Swift: Unfold stock
Standard: Attack w/ E-11 blaster rifle +5 (3d8+1)

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **Parmenter** (2010-02-01 13:09:04)

The fire fight was quick and dirty. And though both sides were taking hits, it was clear that the hangar would soon belong to Alpha, Epsilon, and Theta. Duo was discouraged with himself as his shot went high above his mark. But he saw that his partner's game was spot on. Tapping Kirnos on the shoulder he said, **"We should get closer before reinforcements arrive. We'll be able to stop them at the entrance more easily."** With that said, he took off to the next bit of cover he could find. As he moved, he loosened up his stock and pulled it out. He intended to hit one next time. Setting his weapon for auto-fire, he waited for an opportunity to fire.
Actions: Move; Moving into whatever cover will bring him closer to the pirates. Move; He's unfolding his rifle stock. Swift; He is switching his weapon to auto-fire.

When Duo tapped him on the helmet and told him what he was doing, Kirnos just shook is head. *Is this guy nuts?* But realizing that they can't just stay there, Kirnos stood up, keeping the carbine in his shoulder at the high ready, willing and able to take any one down that will stand in his and the Empire's way. *Wonder how the vets would feel about me now.*
(Move Action: Move as close to the next set of cover [at least 2 squares, but no more than one move action])

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-03 17:31:29)

Seeing the pirates cave before the heavy assault of the stormtroopers, Sharez waves his hand, motioning Theta squad forward. Moving away from the ship and dropping to one knee, he fires another volley of shots against the two pirates still bunkered at the highest level. The shots rake the cargo crates, but fails to find their target.
Kirt follows shortly behind Sharez, and a well-placed blaster bolt drops one of the Weequays as he pokes his head up to take a shot.
Moving forward, Duo heads for a pair of crates standing nearby. As he settles behind them and readies his rifle for autofire, he realizes that they are likely to be ammunition crates.
Realizing a more proper support would be needed to allow him to hold the rifle steady for autofire, Solvar extends the stock of his rifle, and once again presses the trigger. However, it seems like the stock had failed to lock into place, and the power of the recoil nearly knocks the weapon out of Solvars hand. *Critical Miss*
Coming into cover behind Duo, Kirnos lines up his weapon for a shot, but also he blasts into one of the cargo crates the pirates are using for cover.
Snapping out of his trance, Marcus brings his rifle to bear, stock now extended, but his shot blasts into the hangar wall, leaving a black, smoking mark. Right next to his shot lands Beksus´s blast.
Still advancing towards the walkway, the sergeant of Epsilon squad orders his soldiers down on one knee, and in a coordinated assault, the squad unleashes a barrage of laserfire towards the nearest stack of crates. The close range of the assault, and the sheer volume of blasts causes the crates to shatter, and the pirate behind them falls to the ground with a dozen blaster holes in him.
Lining up his rifle for another shot, Eldred pulls the trigger at the sight of a Weequay face, and this time the cry is of pain and death, not anger.
With the last of the pirates dispatched of, the Lieutenant and Beta squad emerges from the ship, and proceeds to advance towards the hangar control room, while Alpha and Epsilon tend to their wounded, and stacks the dead aboard the shuttle. As ordered, Sharez and Solvar brings Theta squad through the blast door to set up a perimeter outside the hangar.
Outside the hangar, you can see down two corridors. One runs to your right, curving itself after a few dozen meters, making it hard to see where it´s leading. The other one runs straight ahead, and you can spot a couple of diverging pathways from it, and at the end appears to be a massive blast door. You cannot see any opposition in any direction.

"Eldred asked over the Squad channel, preparing to hold up or move ahead as needed, at the same time he tried to get a feeling for the corridor on the right, wondering if it would be a good idea to check it out"
((Use the force +2 for "search your feelings" to see if it would good or bad to get into that corridor))

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-05 05:02:25)

"Negative 1524, we secure the doorway and await orders"
Sharez sounded a little disappointed over the comlink, he seemed quite eager to get some more action. A good or bad trait in a soldier, depending on who you ask.
Eldred gets no gut feeling about the hallway whatsoever. It is a corridor with a bend, and anything could wait further in than he could see, even nothing at all.

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **Parmenter** (2010-02-05 11:37:27)

Duo popped out of cover for a moment when he heard the final shot of the battle echo throughout the hangar. He surveyed the arena, then fell back down behind the crates. He'd done his brothers an injustice, he'd barely participated in the fire fight. If only he'd not been so overconfident in his abilities, he might have remembered to aim a bit more accurately, with his weapon in a proper firing mode as well.
Now was not the time to berate himself however, as the lieutenant exited the shuttle Duo snapped to attention once more and awaited orders. The orders came, and gave him another chance to prove himself. Theta squad was ordered to the front line, they would station themselves outside the door to deal with an hostiles intent on retaking the hangar. Guard duty, not exactly a thing of legend, but a place to springboard from into the heat of battle. So, without a word, Duo followed his orders and took up a position outside the hangar with his squad.
Tactically, outside the hangar door was a bad position to set up. The corridor extended in both directions, meaning the eight soldiers of Theta would have to split their manpower and attention to deal with threats on both sides. Duo only hoped that the pirates weren't smart enough to see the situation the same way. Looking at the Sergeant, Duo asked, **"Permission to speak, sir"**
*OOC: Anything resembling cover out here in the hallway? Crates and the like?*

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-05 12:33:02)

Without turning his head, Sharez´s voice came back over the comlink.
"Permission granted, as long as your eyes remain on covered ground"
*There´s no physical objects to take cover behind. You can use the bend of the hallway I guess, but that does leave your back open to the other direction*

**"This doesn't appear to be a very good holding point, sir. If the pirates were to come at us from both sides, we'd be decimated in the crossfire, sir. Requesting permission to scout ahead toward that blast door, sir."** He indicated down the hall. **"If we could expand our covered ground, it would lessen the risk of that, sir."**

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-05 17:05:21)

Sharez goes silent for a while, as if thinking the matter over, but before he can answer you, the door behind you opens, and Lt Nates appears in the hallway, flanked by Alpha and Epsilon squads.
"You might not want to do that soldier. According to the schematics we pulled from the hangar computer, that door leads to the reactor core. Your armor is among the more durable found on the market, but it will offer you no protection against the radiation in there"
He leans in close with the commanders of the two other squads for a moment, nodding towards them and pointing his hand down the hallway to your left. The two squads forms up and begins to move down the hallway, rifles at the ready. Nates turns back to Sharez.
"Sergeant, the schematics shows a larger installation down that split corridor to the right. It is unmarked, but location and size makes it likely to be a barrack or dormitory of some sort. Take your squad and secure it. Kill anyone inside"
Nodding, Sharez motions with his hand forward, urging the squad on the way.

### **Parmenter** (2010-02-06 08:37:02)

Duo took his berating from the Lieutenant without a response. He hadn't meant to enter the blast door, merely to start down that way and scout out the corridors that branched off. Still, he knew that his analysis of the situation had been a good one even though he'd never hear that from anyone else.
With new orders from their CO, Duo formed up behind his squad. Their procession to the target was bound to be by the book, and he had no intention of doing things otherwise.

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-08 17:26:32)

Theta squad moves forward towards the hallway, taking the right turn. There they finds a hallway flanked by four doors. Sharez takes Kirt, Marcus and Beksus to pass through the first door on the right, while Solvar brings the rest of the team to the left.
As expected, they are stepping into a makeshift barrack, with 2-level bunk beds lining the walls, and a couple of storage lockers. At the end of each room is another door, and judging by design standards from the Imperial Academy, it most likely leads to a refresher. To your surprise, the room seems to be empty, but in a few moments, you can see that there appears to be something lying in a few of the beds close to the 'fresher door.
Looking at his team, Sharez gives a small nod and points toward the occupied bunks. On the other side of the corridor, Solvar mirrors his signal.
*You are now in the doors of each dormitory room. The two doors on each side of the corridor leads into one room each. The description I gave goes for both rooms equally*

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **Parmenter** (2010-02-09 22:40:56)

Duo acknowledges the sign from his Corporal, and enters the room. After he enters, he quickly strafes to the right so as to allow those coming in behind him clear access. Moving slowly, he follows the outline of the room toward the 'fresher door. As he moves, he keeps his mind and weapon focused on the occupied beds opposite him. It was obvious the pirates knew that they were coming, judging by the welcome party in the hangar. It seemed a bit too suspicious to Duo that any of them would be sleeping during an Imperial raid.

Kirnos goes to the left side and follows Duo's movement. *Why are there people in the bunks still.* thought Kirnos as he made it a quarter of the way in before remembering the Lt's order. *Wait a second.*
Holding up his left hand in a halt motion, Kirnos looked over at the Corporal, nodding in the still figures' direction before raising his blaster up, hoping the Corporal was understanding his intent.

It was a bit unclear if Solvar understood the intention of what Kirnos meant, but the corporal pointed two fingers towards his eyes, then at Duo and Kirnos, and finally at the occupied bunks.

Beksus enters the room behind the others, the unfolded stock of his carbine pressed into his chest where he could aim properly. He stayed quiet as he saw the occupied bunks, and awaited orders.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-12 07:17:38)

As Kirnos observes the bunk, he notices no movement from it. Whatever is in the bunk is lying very still. With a blanket covering the bunk, he can see very little of what´s in there, but he does notice something else. The bunk, as well as a few others near it, is considerably larger than the rest of them.
In the other room, Sharez points to Beksus and Marcus, motioning them forward towards the bunks to check it out.

As he approaches the bunk, Marcus notices not a single movement, and as he gets closer, he sees that the blanket does not hold the same smooth surface as you´d expect a place where someone was sleeping. In a daring act, he reaches out to pull it away. Underneath, he does not find anything living, but instead a bunch of metallic shrapnel, some stuffed cloth, and a set of energy cells with their safeties removed. Had a blaster shot hit one of them, it would most certainly have caused it to go off, spraying the shrapnel across the entire room.
Going closer, Kirnos makes a similar discovery inside the other room, a crude - but probably effective - booby trap rigged to catch the incautious. Luckily, they had been smarter than that.

### **zenkatarn** (2010-02-16 12:38:19)

Marcus let out a long breath, aware that he had nearly gotten himself and possibly his whole squad killed. He reengages the safeties on the energy cells, just to be safe, then begins looking around the room for other possible traps while he waits for new orders.

Kirnos stared at the IED, knowing that his instinct to blast something was only stopped by his equal cautiousness and curiousity. *Oh, this would be bad.* Kirnos looked over at the Corporal, then back at the homemade explosive.
Carefully putting the sheet away from the IED, Kirnos looked at it as he tried to figure out how to safely disarm it.

### **Tempeste** (2010-02-16 15:16:40)

Beksus saw the IED from a distance and carefully move towards it to give assistance. "I'm good with Mechanics boss," He said whilst lowering his E11 and inspecting the device. "We could disarm it or just try and destroy it in a controlled explosion." The words were strange coming from him, but if anything he did want to prove himself and hopefully gain ranks in the Stormtrooper corps, until such a time that he could personally command vengeance for his parents.

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-16 18:29:55)

Sharez nods an affirmative towards Beksus, but then the entire squad freezes in motion as Marcus singlehandedly attempts to reattach the safeties to the energy cells. For a few moments there, their soldier instincts tells them to dive for cover. However, Marcus seems to manage just fine, and nothing goes "boom". With the safeties replaced, it should now be safe to move the energy cells away from the metallic shrapnel, thus quite simply disarming the crude bomb. As he looks around, Marcus can see nothing suspicious, but you don´t have to be a genius to suspect that the other occupied bunks might hold a similar construction.
Kirnos realizes that the bomb is just as simple as it looks. The energy cells have been placed in such a way to, if struck by sufficient force, detonate, and hurl the deadly shrapnel in a multitude of directions. If they were to be removed from the shrapnel though, this cannot occur. That is probably the reason why the safeties have been removed, he suspects, to make them unstable enough to make moving them difficult. Replacing the safeties, he places the now harmless energy cells in the top bunk of the bed.
With the situation defused, and the dormitories found empty of hostiles, Sharez takes a step out into the hallway. In a matter of moments, the sound of rapid blaster discharge echoes through the corridor, and Kirt, Beksus and Marcus watches the Sergeant stumble back into the room and fall to the ground with several burning holes in his armor.

Duo was surprised about the level of simplicity in the trap they had discovered. It was triggered only by their impatience, and choosing to shoot before looking. However, Theta squad was beyond such amateur tricks. Duo was about to cross the rest of the room toward the opposite door when blaster fire was heard in the hallway, a lot of blaster fire. **"Orders sergeant, sir? Corporal, sir, what's going on out there?"** Before a response came, Duo motioned to Kirnos to keep his weapon trained on the hallway exit. They still needed to check the other door.
With the application of traps involved, and now the addition of blaster fire, Duo was put on edge. He carefully examined the door before opening it. Making sure that he didn't eliminate himself in his duties.

The sounds of a repeated blasters impacting on armor caused Kirnos to turn, seeing the sergeant fall into the room he was walking out of. Realizing they were in bad area, Kirnos moved towards the door, carbine up incase someone comes through. *Great, some one really screwed the gundark on this,* was all Kirnos thought, mentally berating himself for not suggesting they post someone out side.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-20 19:35:33)

As he saw the Sgt fall back inside the door, Beksus moved fast forward together with Marcus, dragging him securely into the room. There was no doubt he was dead.
Pressing tight against the doorway, Kirt peeked outside. Pulling his head back in as fast as it came out to avoid another blaster barrage, his voice was heard over the comlink.
"Visual confirmation of two Weequay. Approximated distance: 50 meters. The hallway is bent, so there is a possibility there are more of them out there"
As he moved up on the door across the hall, Kirnos put his head out and gained confirmation on the two thugs that Kirt had spotted, kneeling at the far end of the corridor, pistols raised and ready. Taking a short step into the hallway, he pulled the trigger and then quickly got back inside again. The blast strikes one of the kneeling thugs in the shoulder.
Leaving the cover of the outside to the others, Duo advanced towards the refresher door, and carefully looked it over, searching for booby traps. When he couldn´t find any, he pressed the controls to open the door. It slid aside and revealed nothing but a standard refresher, although a quite under-maintained one.
Firing a few shots to keep the stormtroopers under pressure, the Weequay began to advance down the hallway, towards the dormitories.
After a few initial moments of shock, Solvar´s voice sounded over the channel.
"Copy that, 9512, fire at will. Remain in cover, and aim carefully"
With these words, the Corporal dropped to his knee behind Kirnos, and opened fire at the attackers. The returning blasterfire scattered the pirate group, pulling them towards the sides of the hallway.

Looking back at the Corporal, Kirnos nodded over to the door that the other teamwas in, before looking back at the pirates *Here goes nothing,* was all he thought as he bolted across the hallway, half praying not to get hit.
Once he was inside the other door, Kirnos turned on his heel, raising the carbine up to his shoulder, and fired a bolt at the enemy in a smooth action that the veterans and instructors taught. *Wonder where they are now,* he half thought.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-24 19:12:59)

The next few moments turns the hallway into an inferno of crossfire. Halted by an unrelenting wave of fire, the Weequay falls to their knees and tries to return fire. However, many of them also falls flat on their bellies, not to participate in the fight anymore.
A sudden cry of pain sounds over the squad comlink, and Kirt fall to the ground, a powerful blaster shot burning a bright hole through the visor of his helmet. At the far end of the corridor, behind the covering Weequay, the impressive figure of a Togorian stands, holding a blaster rifle pressed against his shoulder, pipe still smoking. Two more of the feline pirates appears, and suddenly the tide of fire have turned against Theta squad. The barrage of autofire forces them to take cover from the doorways, and heavily dampens their ability to return fire. Eldred, unable to find a clear shot, leans a bit too far out the hallway, and is caught in the midsection by a pair of blaster bolts and falls motionless to the ground.
In an attempt to regain initiative, Solvar jumps out into the hallway, weapon set to autofire, and sprays a wave of red energy down the hallway. The deadly lances strikes one of the Togorian pirates, leaving a black hole in its blast vest, with blood seeping out from the wound. Seconds later, the brave stormtrooper is cut down by the crossfire.
Suddenly, the entire pirate-occupied end of the hallway erupts in brilliant flashes an cries of pain. Seven white-clad figures appears in the direction from the hangar, spewing blasterfire into the thick cloud left from the grenade assault. Seeing the opportunity to advance, Theta squad leaves their cover, and the combined efforts of the Imperial Soldiers makes short work of the remaining pirates.
One of the newcomers looks over at Theta squad, and while they are all identical in the armor, you can identify the reinforcements as soldiers from Alpa and Epsilon squads. Why there are so few of them, however, is anyones guess. The soldier´s voice is heard over the comlink, and from the tone, you guess it´s the sergeant of Alpha squad.
"Theta squad, sitrep"

Kirnos was gripped in fear when the Corporal went down, charging into the hall way before being cut down. Across from him, Kirt took a shot to the head, his yell cutoff as he hit the ground. *Damn it, we're getting cut to ribbons, where is our rear guard,* was all Kirnos thought as he turned to try to get another shot off when Eldred took two bolts to the gut. Ignoring it, Kirnos turned to face the enemy, half desperate to get out, ready to get cut down as well when Charlie Foxtrot decided to help with a bang.
*What the hell,* was all Kirnos thought when the grenades went off, scattering and maiming the pirates. Taking an initiative, Kirnos moved out into the open again, opening fire on the remaining pirates as the reinforcements started adding their fire.
Once the last pirate stopped moving, Kirnos knelt next to Eldred, grabbing Eldred's med pack, hoping that the stormtrooper was ok when a Sergeant strode forward, asking for a sitrep.
Glancing up, looked into the Sergeant's face. "Sergeant, four down, the Corporal and Sergeant included, and we have a couple IEDs in the bunks that are slightly volatile," Kirnos said, opening the pouch before taking his gauntlet off and pressed two fingers into Eldred's neck, hoping to feel a pulse. "Requesting immediate medical attention for the wounded."
(OOC: Like I mentioned in the Off Duty Chat, I figure that Eldred is more likely to make it since he didn't take as much damage and he did give us a heads up before leaving.)

Duo was too slow in checking the refresher. The battle in the hall was over before he'd joined his squad, his half of a squad. Only four remained of their eight, amongst the fallen were the sergeant and corporal. If the refresher had been another trap waiting to happen, it was likely none of them would be here. As such, Duo's actions weren't uncalled for, however, in this case they weren't needed.
It was the sudden appearance of Alpha and Epsilon that had saved this engagement. And when the sergeant asked for their status, Duo remained silent and let his squad mate answer.

## Re: Chapter I - Pirate Hunting

Feeling over Eldreds neck, Kirnos is unable to feel a pulse. It might still be there, but the man had taken massive trauma and damage towards the midsection, and internal bleedings was a highly likely possibility.
The Sergeant turns to some of his own troopers, motioning towards the dead. While some of the troopers heads forward to see to the fallen, he once again turns back towards the remains of Theta squad.
"IEDs huh? We expected as much. We were ambushed as we breached into what must have been their vault. Bloody mess, but we decided to try and get here as fast as we could to help you out. If you are fit to move, we´ll continue the advance while my men brings the bodies back to the ship, and hopefully coaxes some of the guys from Beta to pitch in over here"

Beksus was unprepared for the shock of losing two teammates. For the first time in a long while he was completely silent and lost in contemplation. He wondered whether the same thing would happen to him. He always saw the White, gleaming armour as being some sort of barrier between tha person within and the weapons of their enemies. That clearly wasn't true anymore..
"Sir.." He began after a few long seconds deep in thought, "It looks like we need to make field promotions." His carbine was gripped tightly in his hands as he glanced down at the now lifeless bodies. "We can't let them get away with this.."

"As a result of these cowards tactics, I think the term you are looking for is reassignments soldier. They shall not go unpunished, that is for sure, and by comparing the plans we pulled from the central computer, they have few places left to hide"
He paused and looked down the corridor the attackers had come from. It wasn´t pretty, now that the smoke had settled, and the full carnage brought about by the grenades was revealed. At least when people died encased in armor, it looked decent.

Ethan was the last of Alpha squad to walk down the hallway. With his blaster rifle tightly gripped in both hands, he was forced to step over the bloody remains of the pirates to move down the hall.
*Serves ‘em right*, he thought to himself.
He slung his weapon over his shoulder as he made his way to the Sergeant. There were far too many stormtroopers downed than he’d like to have seen. He could feel for the one trooper who was checking the vitals of one of the down soldiers. Looking out for the well being of one’s team was a sign of a good soldier.
**“Don’t worry, we’ll make these bastards pay. I didn’t know your squad mates but I’m sure they were good men and even better soldiers.”**
**“Sir”** Ethan addressed the Sergeant, **“Am I to assist bringing the fallen back to the ship? Or can I move ahead with the squad?”**
He hoped for the latter. There were plenty of places left on this rock where these pirates hid and Ethan wanted to help flush them out.

"No, you´ll come with us. The rest of the team will bring the bodies back to the hangar and call for reinforcements while we advance. Numbers will not do any good in these narrow hallways anyway, and schematics shows it ends in a small chamber. Whatever is left of the pirate crew must be in there. They can mop up what´s left, let´s go"
As they squad moves down the hallway, it ends in a massive blast door. The sergeant moves up to the door.
"When we get through, I want a formed semi-circle, and one hell of a firestorm. Give them no time to react. Once the initial shock settles, fan out in pairs and use what cover is available. 9401, you´re with me"
As if to punctuate that this was where the mission ended and the pirates were taken down, the Sergeant removes the small white cylinder from the lower back of his armor and slams it onto the door. He waves his hand to motion the squad back as he punches a few buttons on the cylinder. When done, he joins the rest of you at a safe distance down the hallway. As a deafening explosion (or it would have been, had the gear in your helmet not cut it off) echoes through the hall, he raises his rifle and waves his hand even as he starts to move.
"Forward!"

Kirnos nodded, handing Edred's medpack to the nearest trooper. "Mission first, Sergeant," Kirnos said, reciting an old saying that the veterans would say.
Making sure his weapon was ready and working, Kirnos moved to the other side of the Sergeant, ready to finish this mission off.
As the Sergeant planted his charge, Kirnos thought about using his grenade, but decided against it. *For now, at least,* he thought ashe kept checking behind the squad to make sure now one was coming up unexpectedly. *But I onder what's going to be back.*
When the sergeant came back, it felt like an eternity before the charge blew the door. Moving as the Sergeant said go, Kirnos moved to the edge of the door, carbine in his shoulder as he scanned for targets.

**"Yes sir"**
Ethan was happy he was on the offensive rather than falling back and playing rear guard.
While the Sergeant was setting the explosives, Ethan was checking his blaster rifle. Fully charged powerpack: check! Weapon set to single fire: check! Stock extended: check! Ethan was ready to go to war.
He ran the battle plan through his head a few times. It was good but even the best laid plans rarely survived contact with the enemy. Besides, they had no idea what they would find beyond those doors. The only thing they knew was there was trouble; and that's why they were there.
The charge went off and the Sergeant sang his battle cry to let loose the dogs of war. Ethan followed closely behind Kirnos up to the door that was just breeched. He threw himself up against the wall on the opposite side of the door Kirnos was on. Waiting for the lead of his fellow Stormtrooper, Ethan waited for Kirnos to lean out into the door way to scan for targets when he dropped to a knee and followed suit. He had his blaster rifle up to his shoulder and targeted the nearest pirate.

Ethan was the first to reach the doorway. Even though it was still a bit clouded by the explosion, he could see pretty well inside. It was a quite small chamber, maybe 50 meters long and 20 meters wide. There were two arrays of pillars lined up across the room, creating a walkway of maybe 10 meters wide in the middle. At the other end of the room, he saw a slightly elevated piece of the room, holding a throne. On the throne was sitting a massive Togorian, with a big hammer resting in his lap. Flanking him was two other felines holding blaster rifles, and below the throne were standing four Weequay.
At the sight of the stormtroopers, the large Togorian stood up, laughing. He spoke in a bellowing voice, filling up the room.
"So, the Empires finest have made their way into Keta´s throne chamber? And now they seek to test their might against his? Very well little troopers, let´s play"
As on command, the Weequay at the floor started to rush out into the midsection of the room, firing their blaster pistols towards the entrance. Their aim was far from accurate though, and Ethan barely felt he needed to be worried. Until suddenly a powerful bolt ripped into the wall just above his head, and he could feel the duracrete rubble bounce of his helmet. As he looked up, one of the Togorians had raised his rifle, and apparently this guy was a far better shot.
The pirate lord - Keta, apparently - took a firm grip of his hammer, and started walking down the stairs leading to the throne. He was almost smiling, as he swung the weapon in a wide arc, and with a loud noise, the power charge in the weapon snapped to life.

Beksus moved forwards towards the door with his carbine gripped tightly. He then swung out of cover and fired a fully automatic burst of fire towards the largest Togorian. If he wasn't wearing the stormtrooper helmet his apparent rage would have been obvious, as it were he probably just seemed to be acting too agressively.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-01 17:39:01)

Following orders, Marcus rushed up to the door, and knelt in the opening. Taking aim at the Togorian rifleman who had attacked Ethan, and firing. The distance and elevation makes the shot difficult though (not to mention the adrenaline he is not used to), and the blast goes wide.
The second Togorian raises his rifle, ready to return fire at Marcus. The same conditions seems to be working against him though, since also his shot fails to even get near its target. Clearly annoyed, he sprints down the stairs, following his master to try and get a better shot.
Reaching the edge of the door, Kirnos can thank his helmet for assisting him in seeing through the smoke, dust, and general confusion of battle. Seeing the advancing Weequay, he fires at them in an attempt to slow their advance, but they manage to nimbly evade the blaster bolts.
Pulling up behind Kirnos, Beksus kneels as he tries to steady his rifle for the attack. Flicking the weapon into autofire mode, he aims at the advancing pirate lord and pulls the trigger. The weapon struggles against his grip as the red energy bolts streaks forth. Despite its great size, the massive Togorian is surprisingly agile, and manages to dodge the bolts with minimum effort. His feline companion however, isn´t as lucky, and catches a bolt is the shoulder as he rushes to his masters side. He seems more angered than hurt by it though.
With few spots left to hide in, Duo steps into the doorway, and carefully lines up his shot against the Togorian still left by the throne. The shot streaks across the room, and hits him in the leg, and the pirate drops to one knee, nearly dropping his rifle.
Pleased with the squads performance so far, Alpha squads Sergeant steps in between Duo and Marcus and casts a quick glance at each of them followed by a small nod. He then levels his weapon into the room, spraying forth a flood of blaster bolts into the oncoming Weequay. The bolts causes them to dive, duck and dodge, but one of them catches the fourth "d" and drops dead to the ground instead.

Turning on his heel before he recieved a reply, Kirnos ran to the closest pillar, weapon raised to his shoulder, keeping an eye on the pirates.

The sound ringing in Ethan’s head was nothing compared to the rest of the pain he was in. The wall above his head had been blasted away and if it weren’t for his helmet, Ethan would have made the Final Jump.
Quickly, his attention came back to the action at hand. The entire squad was bunched around the one doorway which made for a poor tactical stand; one explosive could put an end to the entire mission.
He looked up to see Kirnos run out of the door and Ethan was hot on his heels. As his squadmate stopped at the first pillar to take up a defensive stance, Ethan kept going. He hoped the confusion of the battle would allow him to make it behind cover of the other pillar.
Snapping his arm up, Ethan brought his blaster rifle to bear down on the pirate he thought almost ended his life.
He smiled before he squeezed the trigger.

With one of the ranged combatants momentarily dealt with, Duo focuses his attention on the leader who, at the moment, is approaching the squad with a very large hammer. If he were to get within range, the troopers may not be able to withstand the punishment he could deal. Taking a few steps into the room, Duo watches as the large Togorian nimbly avoids attacks from the squad. *This is not good.* Duo thinks, making the decision to fire at the leader. Duo glances at Kirnos, who in return looks back. A plan of attack is formed without a word. Duo takes aim slightly off target, hoping that Kirnos' shot will lead the Togorian into Duo's.

Put on edge by the close call, Ethan rushed into the chamber and put his back against one of the pillars. Taking a moment to focus, he pulled out on the side of the pillar and fired at the pirate who had shot at him, but the shots struck the ceiling and wall behind the target.
Temporarily stunned by the blaster barrage, the Weequay scattered to the side of the corridor, some taking stand behind the closest pillar, others kneeling and trying to present as small a target as possible. Firing their pistols in rapid succession, they opened up on Ethan and the blasterfire raked the pillar he was taking cover behind, leaving duracrete dust and rubble flying.
Obviously enraged, the Togorian shot in the leg forced himself to his feet, and while it obviously pained him, he sprinted a few steps down from the throne. Grinning badly he got down on one knee, and clasping his rifle tightly, he let loose a hail of blasterfire towards the entrance.
Smiling as the stormtroopers scurried for cover, assailed by blasterfire, the massive pirate lord broke into a jogging pace as he closed the distance to the troopers.
Feeling a growing sense of unease as the fearsome Togorian came closer and closer, Marcus took a deep breath even as the blaster bolts flew around his head and lined up his rifle. The shot flew true, but missed Keta by a hair´s breadth.
Apparently content to allow his master to proceed alone, the second Togorian halted in his tracks in the corridor and fires off a shot towards Marcus, but the bolts streaks far overhead.
Bring himself against the pillar opposite Ethan, Kirnos saw the pirate lord close in on them, and in an attempt to slow Keta down, he fired several blasts in a rapid burst.
Remaining in cover behind the doorway, Beksus raised his rifle and pulled the trigger. His shot flew true, catching Keta straight in the gut, and the stride of the Togorian was abruptly halted as the sheer force of the blast nearly knocked him to his knees. Moments later, the concentrated fire of Duo and the Sergeant struck him once in the shoulder and chest and Keta dropped to one knee with a scream.
The voice of the Sergeant sounded over the comlink.
"Finish him off and take down the rest of this scum"
((Duo and Marcus took 6 damage each. You all have an extra Move action in the next round))

With the orders coming from the sergeant, Kirnos turned and moved around the pillar (moving at least two squares and not in the same position I was), carbine up as a smile krept on to his face. *Let's finish this,* he thought, as he sighted on the pirate lord, taking some patience this time as he aimed.
Extra Move Action: Move around the pillar.
Swift Action & Move Action: Aim at Keta.
Standard Action: Attack Keta @ +7 (3d8+4) with a Force Point (5/6 FP)

Following orders, Ethan took a step out from the pillar and aimed straight at the kneeling pirate lord. The shot grazes the Togorians shoulder, but it seems to have done little harm.
Apparently shaken that their lord had been out to his knees, the Weequay seems quite riled up as they fires their guns in desperation towards his attackers. Their desperation is reflected in their aim, however, and the weapons shots is nowhere near close to hitting.
Getting up on his feet, one of the Togorian soldiers raises his rifle, apparently more collected than his Weequay allies. Obviously attempting to hold the opponents forces back, he fires a series of shots towards the entrance, striking into the floor around the troopers.
Roaring out his rage, Keta heaves himself back to his feet. You can see the blood turning his fur crimson, but apparently nothing short of a lethal injury is going to stop this warrior. Shouting out curses in a tongue neither of you understands (but the tone seems to imply curses), the Togorian starts of in a sprint towards you, fury burning in his eyes.
Surprised that anyone could stand after such a beating, Marcus takes careful aim and sends a shot that digs straight into the opponents thigh, causing him to stumble and almost fall over again.
Trying to buy his lord some time to reach the white-clad troopers, the second Togorian fires a burst of shot against Marcus to hold the trooper down.
Swinging around the pillar he was hiding behind, Kirnos gets an even clearer shot at the advancing Togorian warrior, and his shot strikes him straight in the side, and the big pirate falls down again, his strength seemingly spent.
At the fall of their great leader, the Weequay throws their weapons in the air, and begins to chatter what you can only guess to be pleas for mercy in their own tongue. The two Togorians seems more reluctant to throw down their weapons, but a sudden appearance of a new squad of white soldiers in the entrance seems to convince them.
The Sergeant walks slowly forward towards the lying form of Keta, and as he sees a slight twitch in the body, he places several blaster rounds in it, stopping only when a powerful voice booms over the sound of shots fired. As you turn around, you notice Lt Nates standing in command of the arriving troops.
"That´s quite enough sergeant!"
(OK, battle over, as well as Chapter I. For more info, see the OOC thread, but feel free to keep roleplaying here until we start the next chapter)

*Thank the stars*, Kirnos thought when Weequay started throwing down thier weapons in surrender, though the two cats looked less than inclined to surrender. That changed when the LT and the last squad of stormtroopers showed up. *Wonder if he still wants no prisoners?*
Regardless, he was more than happy to end the pirates rigth then and there. *After all, these parasites would try to take revenge on us if they go through the courts, and the prisons are just recruiting centers for the likes of Black Sun.* Keeping his blaster trained on the pirates, Kirnos moved around the pillar so that the LT would have a view of him, taking a look at the rest of his squad.

"No Survivors right boss?" asked Beksus as he kept his weapon sights trained on the larger of the surviving pirates. They'd lost good men getting to this point so it seemed almost like a betrayal to let the scum get out of this alive now. His eyes automatically scanned the rooms for traps as he awaited further instruction, these kinds of criminals could never be trusted.

"Wrong, Soldier"
The voice of Lt Nates was hard and unrelenting as he stepped forward, pulling the Sergeant away from the fallen pirate lord. It appeared that Keta was indeed still alive, though it looked like the minor motions of hands and feet where the only thing the massive warrior was capable off.
Shoving the officer back into line, his eyes glanced over the present soldiers, and they were dead serious. He motioned for the newly arrived troopers to take care of the remaining pirates, and secure them for transportation.
"Striking in self-defense is one thing, but gunning down a surrendering foe is unacceptable, even if we knew they would do it to us in a minute. As soldiers of the Empire, we stand above these thugs, and should never lower ourselves to their level. Return to the ship and prepare for departure"

Kirnos nodded, thankful for a second that the LT wanted to bring them, but a little disapointed that the pirates would be tried. *Tried, they would be*, Kirnos thought, keeping the pirates covered while the other squad took them in.
Once the other squad secured the pirates, Kirnos looked around the room, double checking various features incase there was any secret doors.
Perception +10 for searching the room

Ethan's luck was off today. Not only did he get shot during the engagement but he also couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with his blaster rifle.
It all ended as quickly as it started. The Lieutenant's stormtroopers were securing the room and they were relieved to return to the hanger.
**"Mission accomplished"** he grumbled to himself.
He was with Beskus with wanting to blast the remaining pirates but he knew it'd be best for the Empire if they were taken into custody. Actually, it'd be worse for the Pirate Lord. Death was too good for him. He should be stuck in solitary and the only contact with another living creature should be when he is interrogated. He couldn't wait to see the mighty Pirate Lord broken in an Imperial prison.
He realized his thoughts had trailed off for a second. With a slight shake of his head he turned to catch up with the squad.
He saw Kirnos searching the room and checking the walls. Pirates tended to keep stashed of treasure hidden away and these pirates were no different.
**"Need a hand?"** he asked as he started to check the walls as well.
He was still angry at himself for being shot at by this pirate scum.
**Actions:**
Aid Another: Searching the room (Perception +10)

A brief scan of the wall revealed nothing obvious to the eye, and as Ethan and Kirnos moved closer to do a more thorough examination, a firm voice sounded behind them.
"Soldiers! I beleive I said return to the ship and prepare for departure. Our business here is concluded"

"Yes, sir," Kirnos said, taking one last look at the throne before heading out with Ethan. *Just checking to see if everything is as it should be*, Kirnos thought, taking a glance at Keta's power hammer and decided against it. *It would be useful in an emergency, but only then.*
Once on board, Kirnos looked at what was left his old squad, noticing the number of troopers left of the platoons, and grew slightly melancholy. *We can't afford to do this. Otherwise, our enemies will take us down.*
Just as the thought occured, Jason quickly banished it. *Our enemies aren't just taking us on, they're after other people, ones who can't defend themselves. We need to keep as many of us alive, though. Maybe it's time to get some training done, then.*

Staying together with his squad Duo, observed the happenings around him. But when the lieutenant reminded them of the order he'd just given, Duo was quick to enter formation and make the journey back to the hangar. Though the mission was a success, Duo himself felt like a failure. Half his squad was dead, not to mention members of the other squads. On top of the casualties, he felt that his performance during the operation was not the level of skill that should be present in a fully trained stormtrooper. Perhaps he wasn't ready for the title, or the respect from his brothers.
