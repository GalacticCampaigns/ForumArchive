# [Smuggler's Blues] Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Frost** (2008-05-29 11:13:51)

The battle between the Rebellion and the Empire has grown larger than most would have suspected. The Empire has begun to seriously crack down on alien planets and species while using its propaganda machine to drum up support for it's human's first agenda. The Imperial navy when it isn't hunting rebels has blockaded several sympathetic non-human worlds claiming that they are aiding the rebels. This is a boon for smugglers as the black market priced skyrocket due to the inability to acquire things legally. Some people look to smugglers as heroes bringing in needed supplies and medicine while other look at them as war-profiteers taking advantage of species for their own personal gain. This is where the crew of the ship *Kaiki* falls. Led by their captain Morrigan Ishtar they make their way through this galaxy in turmoil trying to survive as best they can.

X'jan sits in the cockpit of the *Kaiki*, ready for a new day.
"What's our course Morrigan? Away from Imperials I hope, they've been stepping up their patrols lately."

The mentioned woman was currently sitting beside her pilot, one leg crossed over the other. Her gold eyes survey the view of space as she thinks on where to go next.
"Away from Imperrials sounds like a good idea. Scan arround, lets see if we can find anotherr trranporrt." She grins widely as her tail curls and uncurls by her foot.

"Not very specific, but I'll look for some possible courses" X'jan says gruffly
"Where's Clockwerk and Corran? I thought they'd be up by now" he says with an annoyed look.

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-29 21:48:13)

Morrigan chuckles, looking over a list of friendly non-human planets that were in need of help in the way of cargo "You want a courrse? head towarrds the nearrest friendly planet being oprressed. Maybe we'll even find some of those rrebels you like to rread and talk about so much."
She gives him an amused look then glances back down the door to the hall of the ship "as forr the otherr two, you know them, Clocks prrobably drooling over the latest upgrades, and Corran's most likely worrking out..again." She rolls her eyes and continues to look for the data, moving now to a newsfeed on the imperials and reading it aloud.

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-29 23:43:37)

X'jan rolls his eyes and feigns annoyance "Well, then I guess we'll plot a course without them then, and you know, just because I agree with the rebellion and soooo wish for the empire to crumble to dust doesn't mean I'm obsessed with the rebels" X'jan scans through the newsfeed quickly as it shows up
(frost, could use your help, where the heck are we going?)

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-29 23:47:29)

Morrigan laughs "Ah you know I like teasing ya. Who knows maybe we'll find a planet wherre they'rre hiding and you can meet yourr idol orr get a rrebel badge orr something." She grins at him and pats his shoulder "I'll even sew it onto your jacket."
*I quite agree where are we going >.>*

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-29 23:59:51)

X'jan laughs as well "You can sew? Who knew, I guess you do learn something new every day."
(Hm, well I guess we make this 3 post/day thing easy, just where's frost and ganthet?)

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-30 00:48:59)

Her tail flicks at his leg laughing as well "Well you do learrn a few things in a noble house you know, come on I bet even you know how to sew a little."
*Ganthet's at work I think right now and frost dunno I don't know his schedule yet*

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-30 01:04:05)

(weird, I thought Frost was here around this time yesterday)

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-30 01:10:47)

Morrigan smiles and looks out to space "Strrangerr things have happened." she says leaning back into her chair, her tail flicking again by her feet "Did you everr think you'd be worrking forr a Farrghul?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-30 01:21:06)

X'jan smiles at this "I'd have to be a jedi to have seen this coming, so no I didn't think I'd be working for a Farghul. I'd heard Farghuls were xenophobic, though you obviously don't fit that description."

Corran is practicing in one of the empty cargo holds. He has been at it sence he awoke hours ago. He is it one of the Forms for Teras Kasi when he feel s the ship start to move. He stops and grabs his towel and shrit and heads out of the cargo hold and heads for the copit. He has been with the Captain and the others sence he saved her life and she offered him a job and passage on her ship.
Apon reaching the copit Corran walks in his shrit on and towel around his neck. "Where we headed Morrigan?" "Hopefully someplace alot friendly the the last place we where." Corran says trying to see the course they where plotting.

Morrigan shakes her head and chuckles "call me an odd ball." She glances back at the enterence and smiles "Bout time you decided to join us, good worrk out?"

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-30 01:46:24)

X'jan looks at him curiously "you humans are so strange. To practice for hours on end with no stop, hmm, just strange. Anyways, we're waiting for clockwerk, he said he had somewhere interesting for us to go."

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **ganthet** (2008-05-30 01:52:55)

Corran smiles."It is something I have been doing all my life and I am determened to master it." "It is actually very refreshing and clamming you should try it sometime." Corran sits down in the seat behind Morrigan. "I have offered to teach the Captain but she always seems to find away of a vioding it."

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-30 01:56:52)

Morrigan laughs and turns slightly in her chair "And I will keep finding ways of avoiding it, I can shoot anything that comes at me and I have you to watch my back...I'm quite happy with sleeping in."

### **Frost** (2008-05-30 10:42:18)

Clockwerk as he is called by most sentient who cannot pronounce his true designation is re-aligning the magnetic couplings to the hyperdrive...again. His diagnostic revealed a .05%discrepancy. The coupleing lies on his work bench as he cleans the connections..again.

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-30 12:08:48)

"Amazing how focused you two can be. Anyways, Clockwerk, where are we going?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-30 12:36:27)

Morrigan hums softly finally turning to the pilot "lay in a courrse forr Tatooine, lets see if we can find some worrk." she hits the comlink for the ship and to the section the Verpine was most likely to be "Clock you awake?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Frost** (2008-05-30 13:01:06)

The verpine recieves the captains message over his antennae. He focuses and sends a response through the comm system
"I am awake captain. How can I be of service?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-30 13:39:40)

Morrigan smiles "Glad to hearr you'rre up, we'rre heading to Tatooine. Time to look forr worrk, arre you tinkerring back therre again?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **ganthet** (2008-05-30 13:41:30)

"Well I guess I should go get cleaned up. Then I will make sure that my medkit is loaded and ready to go." Corran gets up from his seat and heads for his cabin. "If you need me just call. Any idea if we will find a job on Tatoonie?" Corran realizes that his life doesn't require alot of credits but it is easier to get stuff done with them.

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Frost** (2008-05-30 13:45:03)

Clockwerk clicks his mandibles slightly irritated by the interruption of his cleaning.
"I assume you will want to use the hyperdrive. I will have it re-assembled momentarily captain but it is my duty to warn you it is out of alignment by .05%."

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-30 13:53:11)

Morrigan rolls her eyes and shakes her head laughing softly "That's fine Clock, we'll take ourr chances with that .05% and when we dock you can fix it to yourr hearrts content ok?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Frost** (2008-05-30 14:23:52)

A few minutes later the comm signal beeps as Clockwerk's voice comes on.
"We are ready for hyperspace captain. Rotbart should be able to calculate the jump when ever you desire."

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-30 14:34:50)

Over the comlink, you hear Rotbart pipe up, â€œWas someone talking to me. Was just making sure, the guns were in working order.â€
*OOC: I am your general roustabout. Am mainly your gunner, but can help out in mechanics, use computer, pilot.*

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **ganthet** (2008-05-30 15:13:42)

Corran walks to his cabin and grabs a change of clothes and his Force Pike. Then he heads to the refrecher to clean up. *A nice santistream and a change of clothes and I will feel alot better."* Corran whistle a song he doesn't know the name to but he has heard it in his head for most of his life as he walks down the corridor.

X'jan turns on the comm system again "Rotbart, forgot about you, you've been so quiet lately. Anyways, how long till we're at Tatooine?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Frost** (2008-05-30 17:46:03)

The ship enters hyperspace and in 3 short days is now orbiting Tatooine. The twin suns twinkle in the background and the desert world is large in the view screen.

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-30 17:49:11)

X'jan turns away as the glare of Tatooine's twin suns falls upon his eyes "I hope this pays well, because I dislike all that sun. Anyways, we'll land in about 10 minutes"

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-30 19:00:04)

Rotbart uses the navicomputer to help perform the calculations for the hyperspace jump to Tantooine. Once, they jump into hyperspace, he knows, they are basically safe; barring him misplacing a decimal point, here or there. Rotbart sets an alarm to warn them, five minutes before they will leave hyperspace and arrive at Tantooine.
While in hyperspace, he makes sure to spend time with Clockwerk to assist and learn from him.
When the alarm sounds, Rotbart immediately heads to the guns. As he moves into the chair, Rotbart comms Morrigan, â€œI am taking up my gunnerâ€™s position. We donâ€™t want to be sitting ducks for anyone waiting.â€ He runs through checks, ensuring power is available; while listening for any comm to himself.

Now, that they were in normal space, Rotbart is on guard scanning all firing arcs for possible threats. Over the comm, Rotbart laughs and replies, â€œXâ€™jan, I donâ€™t worry.  **I SURVIVE!**â€

"Land in Mos Eisley, I know a guy at the cantina who might have some inforrmation forr us." Morrigan says, leaning her head against her hand as it leaned against the wall, for the coms she gives a simple reminder "be on yourr guarrd while we'rre herre."

You are assigned a docking bay and allowed to land. You put her down in the assigned birth and drop the loading ramp. As you step out in to the hot dry air a group of technicians start hauling re-fueling cable towards the ship. A human male approaches the ship holding a data pad and being followed by a small hovering droid.
As he reaches the end of the docking ramp he stops. He looks at you all.
"Who's the Captain of this tub?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-31 14:21:01)

Morrigan steps up to the man slowly, her tail swishes slowly behind her. She stands straight and tall looking down to the man regardless of his height, a true noble posture. "Don't, call my ship a tub." she gives the man a look, before giving him a plesent smile "Now, what is it you need of me?"

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **ganthet** (2008-05-31 14:47:21)

Corran steps to Morrigan's side at the approch of the stranger. He has his Force Pike at the ready. He looks at the man making it known to him that no threats to his friend will be toleranted.
(OCC: Corran does not have his blaster on because it is not his sytle. Other wise he is dressed in simply clothes and a vest his utility belt and combat gloves and black soft bantha hide boots. He looks kind of out of place with the rest of the group.)

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-31 15:00:42)

Morrigan glances over briefly to Corran, smiling at her faithful bodyguard and friend before again turning to the man before her, waiting for what he wanted.

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-31 15:55:18)

X'jan strolls up behind the two, blaster pistol drawn and ready, while he does not have Corran's menacing glance, he lets his pistol do all the talking

### **zerah** (2008-05-31 16:03:15)

Morrigan lightly motions her hand for X'jan to put his blaster down "Now Now..let hearr what the man has to say, perrhaps he'll apologize for insulting ourr beautiful ship."

### **zerah** (2008-05-31 16:20:42)

Morrigan smiles and leans over to whisper back to him "I'd have hoped you'd put it on that, but the man doesn't know that now does he?"

Corran roles his eyes at his friends inability to not interject violance into a conversation. He wispers to his friend. "It does you no good if you tell him that." Corran returns his gaze back to the man who insulted his home. "Speak your bussiness and be quick about it your are already borring me." Corran trys to inject more menace into his look.

Rotbart stands back watching his comrades and just shakes his head. With the weapons being brandished, he decides to diffuse the situation. â€œThey just really hate paperwork! They just donâ€™t understand, that without the paperwork, nothing would be accomplished. Like the saying goes: *â€™The jobâ€™s not done, until the paperwork is done.â€™*â€
â€œBesides, he just needs to know, who is paying the parking fee and what work we may need done.â€

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Frost** (2008-05-31 21:59:10)

The man looks startled at the show of hostility. He takes a small step back.
"I am with spaceport, Im here to check your pilot information and see how long you are staying to access docking and refueling fees. Who is your pilot I need to see his license and I need to see your cargo manifest."

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-05-31 22:08:36)

Morrigan shoots a look to Rotbart before smiling pleasently to the man before her "of courrse sirr." she pats the Duros on the shoulder "This is my pilot and I'm surre he'll be happy to show you his lisence and that is Rrotbarrt, he'll be happy to hand overr the manifest. As forr how long, I do believe we will only be herre forr a shorrt time lets say..hmm..about fourr days to be safe. Would we be able to have a rrefund if we leave beforre then?"

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-31 22:31:43)

With the Captain mentioning him, Rotbart moves forward to hand the spaceport bureaucrat a datacard, â€œThatâ€™s our manifest. Whom should I give our supply requests. I have another datacard with that information.â€
Turning to Morrigan, â€œI checked with Clock on what supplies, we needed, before we exited hyperspace.â€

### **zerah** (2008-05-31 22:46:09)

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-06-01 00:20:24)

Morrigan grins "He's a bit impaient." she turns back to the pilot "Hand overr yourr lisence forr rrevew and I'll buy you all a meal and a rround of drrinks." She looks the man before her over and grins wider "even you if you'd like to join us."

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Frost** (2008-06-01 00:29:52)

The port official processes your paperwork. It takes only a few moments.
"With berthing fee and refueling it will be 250 credits for the four days. Payable at the office on your way out."
He hands back you pilots license and manifest.

### **ganthet** (2008-06-01 01:00:03)

As the man leaves Corran sighs. "Sorry about that Morrigana. I just don't like being surprised is all, and Buragates i hat the most with there paperwork and endless forms." Corran looks around I hope there is money to made here or this is a huge waste of time, fuel and credits." Corran ajusts his combat gloves and makes sure his force pike is ready to go. "I would be interested in any martial artist that might be around. I will have to see if there is any here." Corran gives Morrigan and the others a smile. "Lead the way Boss."

---

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **zerah** (2008-06-01 01:08:51)

Morrigan chuckles and leads the way out, paying the fee at the office and then heading straight to a cantina "Come on boys, lets get some grrub and drrinks...and a job hopefully.." she mumbles the last part, heading to the Cantina she knew her contact liked best.

Corran looks back at X'jan. "You could always practice with me in the cargo hold. I could us a sparring partner." Corran smiles. He knows non of his friends unstand what he does, and he wishs they could ge abetter understanding of it, but all things in time his master used to say. " Captain we could use a few more medical supply for the ship. I can patch ou guys up with what I got."

### **ganthet** (2008-06-01 01:36:40)

"It is not about fighting. It is an art that takes years to perfect, I am still working on it." Corran starts to see the canteena that they are heading for. "And with the look of the places around here I am sure to get plenty of practice." He has seen some seedy places in his travels but nothing compares to what is before him. "How can these people live like this? It was a hard life with my master but this is nothing like that." Every where he looks he sees crime and oppression. Life has not been kind to these people.

â€œWhich means, we probably will need the medical supplies. Weâ€™ve been lucky, so far. Our captain has been able to talk us out of most of our troubles. But, it looks like talk will not always work around here. Plus, sooner or later, someone is bound to want to take what is ours, hoping for a quick credit. Best to prepare for, that eventuality. I have had some training in first aid and emergency medical. Just in case, you get hurt, Corran.â€
After listening a bit and thinking of Corranâ€™s offer, â€œCorran, I spend most of my time out of the gunnerâ€™s chair, working and learning from Clockwerks. But, I guess, I could use some physical training. Let me think about it and I might find time to spare with you. As long as, you promise, to fix me up if you are too rough on me or I screw up and hurt myself. Right now, my mind is occupied with the promise of free food and drinks. With my current finances, I was afraid; I would be stuck on board the ship until our next pay.â€

The Mos Eisley cantina is everything it rumored to be. The place is full of the worst looking scum this side of Nar Shaddaa. The place is packed with aliens from all over the galaxy. The bartender glances over when you enter but doesn't say anything. He is a rough looking human.

Upon walking in to the Cantina, Rotbart takes a quick tactical evaluation of the layout. He pays particular attention to ingress/egress points and pathways to them. After Captain Morrigan tells the bartender, she is paying; Rotbart orders his drink and food.
While waiting for his drink, he looks for an open table with a good view and tactical location. Once, he finds one, he nods his head in its direction and says, â€œOver There.â€ He grabs his drink and slowly walks toward the table. He evaluates the people and their weapons in the tableâ€™s blind spots, first. He makes it to the table and takes his seat. Now, he starts analyzing the other patrons, their race and weapons. Every few seconds, he makes sure to take a quick glance over to those still at the bar or coming over, to make sure nothing happens to them or anyone paying particular attention to them.

The bartender scowls at the drink orders but makes them anyway. The patrons here are all armed with various weapons of all sorts. The whole atmosphere here is threatening. You all take your seats and start in on your drinks. You catch sight of a bothan moving through the crowd towards you table. He is armed with a heavy blaster but it is secured in his holster.

â€œWell, itâ€™s going to take about five days and a few thousand. Some of the fractures are in a hard to reach and critical areas. And, there may be some need to replace some components. But, we will try to do it as cheaply as possible, without compromising quality. *Clockwerks stayed on the ship*, trying to nail down that discrepancy on the hyperdrive.

Rotbart mildly cringes, when referred to as â€˜Masterâ€™. But, they had had the â€˜just call me, Rotbartâ€™ conversation, many times before. Its taking some time, but, he is starting to get used to it. â€œHi, Clockwerks. The captain has some cargo for us. While no one here would give it a mind, the Imperials may take objection. Low and behold, we are taking it to where, the Impies are thick as thieves.â€
â€œI think, the Captain got the gist of what, I was trying to tell her. Since, she ordered me back here. But, I was thinking, we could add some hidden compartments, to put the cargo in. The delivery is for 5 tons. We should be able to do that amount and maybe, a little extra. I wanted to run it by you and us work up the plans and required materials, before she comes back.â€
Meaning to let Clockwerks reply, Rotbart pauses. But, it is only a microsecond before something else pops into his mind. â€œClockwerks, I am starting to accept, you always calling me; â€˜Master Rotbartâ€™. Since, it seems to be the way, you speak. It may just be formality. But, I was wondering, if it has additional significance. Should I be properly calling you: Master Clockwerks? You were introduced to me, as Clockwerks. Now, I know, I could not pronounce your real name, but, would you prefer to be called by something different or have you adopted â€˜Clockwerksâ€™, as a nickname?â€

"The hive I came from was imprinted with a very formal varient of basic. It is..difficult to unlearn that imprint and be less formal. Clockwerk is the designation given to me by the Captain and I have grown fond of it. I am curiuos as to what a Clock is however. The Captain says its an ancient chrono-meter."
He pauses for a moment and seems to think.
"I have done the calculations for the concealed compartments. I will need an alloy that blocks sensors to line the compartments to prevent detection. The cost would be about a thousand credits per 1000 kg of concealed space. I estimate we could only conceal about 5% of our overall cargo space with out it being obvious that there are hidden areas. So that is about 7.5 tons. Estimated cost is about is roughly 1000 credits per tonnage hidden."

The vendor offers you a wide selection of medpacks, medkits, surgical kits (only used once). He even has a couple of FastFlesh medkits. A sureprisingly advanced medpac to find in a desert market place. This is a dangerous town though.

Rotbart is fascinated by the explanation of his nickname and files the fact in his mind. Rotbart listens carefully to Clockwerkâ€™s calculations and evaluation of his idea. â€œI figured, roughly the same amounts. Though, as usual, you are more precise. It would be a good idea to at least cover the 5 tons, for this shipment. But, I donâ€™t know, how much the captain wants or has to spend on this project. Maybe, we should come up with some plans, to implement these compartments a ton at a time.â€
â€œWell, your formality and the difficulty in changing the imprinting must have some reasoning behind it. With it being easier for me to modify my speech patterns, I think, I will start calling you, Master Clockwerks. Out of respect for you, your abilities, and being so kind to teach me, so much.â€ Rotbart pauses for a second or two, â€œMmmmmm, you say a clock is an ancient chronometer. Maybe, this clock was mechanical and keeping it in working order was quite a feat, in and of itself. Maybe, the captain chose it, as a means of showing respect to you and your mechanical ability. There may have been an archaic saying, something like, â€˜By the Force, your Clock worksâ€™. And, *Clockworks* was an exclamation meaning something wondrous or miraculous.â€
â€œWell, do you want to collaborate on the plans? Or, do you think, I should work on them, myself, and you double check my work? Since, I am not sure, the captain wants them. I would hate to take you away from what you are doing, for some misunderstanding on my part.â€

Rotbart really wants to impress Clockwerk with all he has learned, since, initially coming aboard.
He carefully studies the shipâ€™s schematics and Clockwerkâ€™s modification. He goes though the design, gathering the measurements and other data to perform the calculations on supplies, workforce, and time. Additionally, he tries to come up with two additional designs: one for 5 tons of hidden cargo, and another implementing compartments, a ton at a time. After he is finished, he provides all three designs and calculations to Clockwerks.

Master Clockwerks and I have designed the modifications, so, we can install in one ton increments. If we were anyplace else, we should be able to do it for 1,000 credits per ton. Installation will take one day per ton with a minimal work crew of 5. Master Clockwerks and I can handle the mechanical side of thing, but, we would need the entire crew working on it. â€œ

They see you arrive and start shouting at you in Gamoreon *(ooc:pig latin?)*. A human female comes from around the front of the hauler armed with a rifle.

Contacting the Captain, â€œCaptain, Rotbart here. Hauling cargo from a Hutt world directly to the Core, will raise suspicion. Even, if everything was on the up and up. Time permitting, it may be worthwhile to have a couple of stop. We could haul cargo from point to point, working out way to our final destination. This would lower suspicion, but, on the flip-side; we would open ourselves up for additional inspections. With more people looking at our hold, we have a greater risk of the compartments being discovered. Though, they will be very well hidden and need a very detailed search to find. Accessing the risk between the two plans really canâ€™t be accessed, since, it is dependent on where we go and who is inspecting.â€

Sitting down at the System Console, he uses the Navicomputer to pick worlds, that they could use to leapfrog, from Tantooine to Huburine Sector. Having picked the stepping stones along the way; Rotbart reconnects to the holonet to find â€˜legalâ€™ cargo from each point to the next.

I need you to point the weapon forward at the speeder truck.â€
As Clockwerks is supposedly headed to the guns, Rotbart swings the ship around and comes barreling back, to play chicken with the truck. He tries to line up the turret with the truck, so it will be a straight shot.
*I donâ€™t know, what to roll against. But, I figure, a armed spaceship should intimidate the heck out of the truckâ€™s driver.
Also, donâ€™t know, if the ship has some sort of external PA. But, if it does, add the following.*

You have the ship here with Rotbart & Clockwerk onboard. You have a stolen (borrowed) speeder with Captian and Corran onboard. X'jan is severly wounded on foot by his own cargo hauler.
Cargo haulers have a speed of 8. Speeder has a spd of 10. Ship has a speed of 12.
Cargo hauler with stolen goods is 64 sq away.

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-12 14:09:01)

***This is all OOC**
1) So, going full out give you 4x speed. Since, stolen hauler is speed 8 x 4 = 32 for 2 rounds.
2) For Rotbart to catch up: 48x = 32x+64, 16x=64, x=4 rounds.
3) For Captain to catch up: 40x = 32x+64, 8x=64, x=8 rounds.
4) Though, I am pretty sure, the starship weapons could probably hit the truck at this range, we donâ€™t want to destroy the cargo.

Rotbart pursues the truck, as fast as possible. He wants to approach, so, they can place a shot across the bow. He wants to make sure, that the shot will not have a chance of destroying the cargo.
*I think, the 4x is all out movement. For, the truck is the get-away vehicle for the robbery. So, if they spent a round to get you and took off immediately, it will take you: 40x=32x+96, 8x=96, x=12 rounds. But, you would have to ask Frost to be sure.
Does the ship have some sort of PA system?
Can I position the ship for the shot, without a chance of hitting the truck?*

*ooc: What? I meant max velocity, which is expressed in km/hour, and is much, much faster. Assuming my calculations are correct this is the farthest I could go with max velocity.
Using the SoroSuub X-34 landspeeder in the book as an example, here I go.
Max velocity 330km/h
330000 meters/h
5500 meters/min
550 meters/6 secs (1 round)
approx 367 squares per round. Though I don't have to move the full 367, I could choose to move only 88 (which I think is the distance it would be after I used all-out movement.*

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-13 00:30:09)

***OOC:**OH! I see, what you are getting at. I am looking at Frostâ€™s post, where he stated: â€Cargo Haulers have a speed of 8. Speeder has a speed of 10. Ship has speed of 12. Cargo Hauler with stolen goods is a good 64 squares away.
I would assume, the Cargo Hauler is going max velocity. Using the speeds above, that would put the max velocity at <!– s8/ –>![8/](https://i.ibb.co/kVxpy8vX/icon-eek.gif)<!– s8/ –>10 of the speeders 330 km/h (264 km/h). So, it would be traveling 440 m/round (293 sq per round) So, before they picked you up, it would have been 586 sq ahead. Plus, another 293 sq for the round picking you up (879 sq). So, it would change the calculations to: 367x=293x+879, 74x=879, x=12 (approx).
Plus, you would have to consider the speed of the YT-2400 = 12 sq (max 800km/h). Roughly, twice as fast, as the speeder. And three times the speed of the hauler.
When the chase came up, I looked at the max velocity, but, decided to use squares from Frost posts. Consider it sort of like the difference between character scale and starship scale (maybe, call it: vehicle scale). Thus, the speeds in Frostâ€™s post are speed relative to each other and the 64 square are based on this relative speed. It surely makes the math a lot easier.*

## Re: Who says crime doesn't pay?

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-13 00:51:28)

*ooc: Frost said that the cargo hauler was going all-out movement which is why I thought I could catch it easily with max velocity. That and they could have used max velocity only twice, instead of 3 times, as you have to have used all-out movement on your last turn, so it would only have been 618 squares ahead
which means around 7 rounds to catch it
Of course the ship can catch it in 1 round.*

You want to bring starships into character scale combat then I will too. So if you want to use max velocity then they have been going max for two rounds. I will let you math guys figure it out.*

Anyways, X'jan now takes the speeder to max velocity, going 367 squares. "I love this! Hey captain, tell rotbart to go faster, it'll take some time to catch'em !"
So the hauler is 504 squares away. (hauler would be 797 away after it's turn, but I gained 74 squares, just as a note, rotbart can catch it in 2 rounds.)
578 after my turn
+293 after hauler's turn
-367 after my turn

*ooc: Not taking turn yet, just some free actions.
I just figured out something that will make future max velocity much easier. The relation between max velocity and squares moved is exactly Max Velocity * 1&1/9, rounded to closest number.*

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-13 16:48:20)

Rotbart canâ€™t believe his ears. Pictures of the hauler crashing into the ship and both being destroyed, run through his head. *The cargo will probably be strewn and mixed in with the sand over miles. The cartel will not be pleased with us destroying most of the cargo. And, they are not a forgiving lot. If I do that, I hope to die in the crash. It will be a quick death, at least. Instead of, the tortures the cartel would gift him. Worst part about it, he wouldnâ€™t know, which cartel he should be running from.*
Quickly, he does some fudge factoring to get a general idea of the damage to the ship and to the cargo hauler. It didnâ€™t look pretty at all. But, he had his orders. So, reluctantly, Rotbart coms back, â€Aye, Aye. Captainâ€. *Glad, this is not my ship.* â€I will stop those buggers!â€
Trying to calm his nerves, for what he has been told to do, Rotbart tries to joke it off. Using the shipâ€™s internal coms (com to captain is still open, so, they will hear it also), â€œMaster Clockwerks, the captain must really love you. She wants to offer you, enough work for the rest of your life. She just ordered me to land, so, the cargo hauler can crash into us.â€
Suddenly, something he said earlier, sparks his mind and pictures of him stepping on an insect, floods his mind. â€œMaster Clockwerks, you may not have the work of a lifetime, ahead of you. Got an idea.â€ *That cargo hauler couldnâ€™t handle the weight of this ship. It would be stopped dead in its tracks.*
Figuring, it would cause minor dents and only very minor structural damage, Rotbart decides to try and land on top of the hauler. As he closes on the cargo hauler, he throttles back a bit to slowly. Once, he is over the hauler, he has slowed and matched the speed of the hauler. Rotbart does his best to center the hauler under the ship. Then, starts to decend and bump the hauler underneath him. Finally, he keeps letting more and more of the shipâ€™s weight be borne by the cargo hauler, slowing it down. He keeps the engines going and his eyes on the altitude guage. He wants to be able to veer or take off, if it looks like he is getting too low.
*OOC: Trying a three-dimensional version of the classic car chase and bumping the other car. Itâ€™s a combination of semi vs car and the shows of a plane/helicopter landing on a semi.
Ok, I donâ€™t know: If I can use a Force Point, since, I am already using Foolâ€™s Luck. Currently, my pilot skill is +4 = +9 +5(Foolâ€™s Luck) â€“ 10 (ship size). I will use a FP, I can.
With what Rotbart is trying, the closest thing in the book is Ramming (page 172-173) and Table 10-3: Collision Damage(page 173). Though, he is trying to bump/land/stop the cargo hauler, not a full blown ramming to destroy it. Frost, you will have to determine, how this works.*

Rotbart positions himself over the hauler and starts to lower it while moving at extremely high speeds.. The hauler tries to avoid but can't. The ship bumps the hauler and the hauler skids through the dirt as the repulsers try to compisate by shooting the vehicle back up into the lowering ship. The resulting collision is spectacular. The hauler frame lodges into the bottom of the ship causing massive damage. Then it scrapes across the ground and gets pulled out of the ship and cartwheels across the desert. Bits of parts and debris go everywhere.

The vehicle skips of the ground ricochets off the bottom of the *Kaiki*. The speeder spins sideways trying to get out from under the descending ship. It hits the sand again and starts to cartwheel across the desert. It finally explodes in a gaint fireball.

When his patient starts to thrash about, Rotbart tries to prevent him from hurting himself. The patients involuntary thrashing tickles his memory about glitterstim overdose. The glitterstim cargo could have been released during the crash and entered the patientâ€™s bloodstream from the burns. He scans the burned patient for evidence of glitterstim and treats him accordingly. After getting his patient to stop thrashing, Rotbart starts dressing the burns.

Rotbart gets the patient secured and starts to treat him. He feels a tickle in his brain. He sees an image of Jabba the Hutt laughing as a bothan is being tortured.
Jabba says something in Huttese

Corran waits for a minute, then asks. "Still no answer huh?" Corran realizes if the Hutts are involed in this they are in for it and that is the kind of trouble they didn't need. "I suggest that we travel as group for awhile no more running off half cocked we stick together from now on." "And you." Corran looks at Morrigan. "You don't go any where without me got it?"

Rotbart figures, the Captain wants to present a non-combative appearance. Otherwise, she would have had them all come with her. But, that doesnâ€™t stop him from taking a position around the corner and out of sight. So, he can simply step out and cover the shipâ€™s gangway and retreating crew mates.

Morrigan's tail taps again against Corran's leg in a few precise beats, they'd been together long enough for him to recognise the beats as code and for what they were, he's distracted, going to try to convince him more, be ready.
"Is it the number that has you confused? We haven't been here long, surely you can see that a docking number is not viable proof for the crew and ship you are looking for. After all, docking numbers are rather random, this was one of the open slots most likely vacatied by the ship you are looking for I would imagine." She crosses her arms and taps her lip with a soft hum of thought "Might I suggest taking a ship up and seeing if a trail was left? Anyone that would dare try and cross the noble Jabba the Hutt and any that have the honor to work for him couldn't be very smart, I'd wager they'd have left a trail...quite easy to follow I'm sure for anyone that works for the noble Hutts, childsplay really wouldn't you agree?"

We may need a hasty escape.â€ Knowing Clockwerksâ€™ antennae will pick up the communication, Robart adds, â€œClockwerks, if things start to go bad out there, let us know. And, if possible, let the captain know what, we are ready for.â€ Rotbart hopes, no one will understand the Verpine's language and mistake it for some racial anomally.

Corran raises his force pike up just barely able to stop the swinging vibro axe. The Gamorrean stumbles back and takes a blast in the chest from Morrigan. He flies back with a squeal and doesn't move.
Clockwerk starts making his way to engineering
X'jan delays
The Rodian doesn't like his odds now and starts running towards the exit.

Morrigan aim at the rodians retreating back, firing a shot at him before moving slowly up the ramp back into the ship "Corran hurry!"
*Aim, 1d20+5 DMG: 3d6+1
and Saracia is out of the game I thought?*

*ooc: Yeah, but she can still be roleplayed*
X'jan starts the ship, but doesn't move it yet, as he is still waiting for the crew to get onboard

Corran quickly checks his wound and scambles back up the ramp. Looking at his friend. "Thanks for the save Boss. I owe you one." Corran heads into the ship to the med bay to patch himself up.
((I have one of those fast flesh packs left. And I should have about 6 total med packs right?))

Morrigan stands, relieved to have her friend safe. Still holding her wound she lifts her blaster again, and aims to the retreating Rodian's back. He was getting away, she was wounded, but she wasn't one to let loose ends stay loose, and his running back to the others would not help them "Have to trry.." she mumbles as she fires.

When Corran gets to the med station on the ship he finds the med supplys and starts to patch himself up. "Damn, that hurts!" he yells out. He continues to work, he will have to check on Morrigan, she might have taken a wound durring the battle.
((OCC: Treat injury +7 will take 10 if needed.))
