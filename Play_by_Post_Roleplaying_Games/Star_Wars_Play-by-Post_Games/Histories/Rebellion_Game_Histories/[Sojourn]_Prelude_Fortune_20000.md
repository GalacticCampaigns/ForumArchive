Ah Tatooine to many the end of the line, to you yet another opportunity. Lately you have been living well, you have found a gig at a local casino. Grumboâ€™s is a out of the way establishment that caters to Tatooines free class of citizens. The place does see traffic from abroad but the local gamblers calls Grumboâ€™s home.
Shortly after arriving on Tatooine you found Crumbo`s, which was the same time you discovered the ruse within. The games are set, a common practice in many casinos to ensure that the house wins.
But you are smarter then the regulars here. Early on you made an arrangement with one of the casinos maintenance workers named Bandous. He rigs the games with a small device which forces the games to pay out on a signal from your com. Not a bad setup it has allowed you to live rather comfortably here on Tatooine, and the extra funds has put a girl on your arm.
Karla Krey an attractive Bothan female, her stage name was Kitty. During your fund runs she acts as look out for you. In your down time she has made no secret of her interest in you. So as it is another day and you have had your eye on buying an Aratech 74-Z speeder bike. Another trip to Grumbos should do the trick.
From the outside Grumbos shares the same drab tan walls as the other sand worn buildings. On the inside colorful lights, music and dancing girls assault you senses. With Karla on your arm you both enter, she smiles at you and heads for her usually spot on the dance floor.
The room is adorned with various gaming tables and machines of luck within the center floor. Flanking the entrance on both sides are twin bars. Both the left and right sides of the casino are dominated by stages where bands play and dancers entertain. At the back end of the establishment are private booths for gaming as well as other amendments offered at Grumbos. Grumbos is nothing if not colorful.
The floor itself is a bustle of activity, patrons from all over Tatooine and beyond are present today.

Dexter walks into the casnio. His lady on his arm and thoughts of the days winnings on his mind he checks his pocket to make sure his credit chip is there and his comm link another assorted gear, including a well hidden holdout blaster cause you never know. " I am feeling lucky today my dear. Shall we get a drink and then hit the tables?" He motion to the bar on one of the many severing girls moving around the room.
Yes life was good for Dexter he couldn't think of anything he rather be doing at the moment. Well he could come up with something he rather be doing looking over at Kitty, but there was plenty time for that later. Moving thought the room he take everything in. He spent a great deal of time learning how to read other beings and what to look for. He also checks to see if there are any new faces on the staff. Little things like that got make or break his little scam it also might mean that they where on to him. As they make it to the bar he orders a Corillian brandy and something nice for Kitty. " Where would you care to go to dinner later my dear? Or we could stay in tonight." Dexter smiles at her. Yes life was good but that couls change at any moment.

Scanning the room you notice that Grumbo`s has picked up its business early today. Must have been a new transport land in town recently. With more customers comes more guards. Grumbo`s has twice as many guards walking the floor today.
Karla sits down and takes the offered drink. The Bothan female then slides off her stool and purrs in your direction. â€œSurprise me!â€ Frowning slightly Karla continues â€œKitty has to get to work.â€ With a pout she waves her fingers and walks off towards the stage.
((other then the extra guards which is common with the extra customers, everything looks business as usual ))

## Re: Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-10-29 17:28:46)

"I will have to come up with something special then." Dexter says as Karla walks away. "Untill tonight then." raising his class. The extra security would be to much of aproblem just have to take it alittle slower was all. Dexter slides off his stool and heads forone of the tables to start the fun for tonight.
Placing his bet he thinks he will wait untill there is enuff creds in the pot before he walks away with it. Can't draw to much interest to himself. He lays down a bet of 50 credits and waits to see what happens.

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-30 08:01:07)

You find yourself at a sabacc table. The dealer a tall aloof Munn hands out cards to the tables patrons. Including yourself there is a wiry Rodian dressed in greens, a rather large Ithorian who reeks of hard drink and a flamboyant blonde human wearing a puffy shirt.
After a few rounds of sabacc you manage to cut even, though the drunk Ilthorian cleans up. The casinos floor has become a blaring party as patrons win and loose hands.
After a quick check to your comlink you receive the all clear signal from Karla signaling the floor is clear.

---

## Re: Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-10-30 10:30:10)

Getting the all clear. Dexter decides that sabacc wasn't his game "Well gentlemen it has been a pleasure." Raises from his seat and heads to see what other action is going on in the room. While walking through the crowd he tries to see what info he can cleen from any of the people in the room plus find the table or machine that would strike his fancy.

## Re: Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-31 09:05:08)

You canvas the floor walking from game to game. Trying to pick up little bits of information here and there. A few times you attempt to start a conversation with the casino patrons only to be ignored at best.
Something is up. Again you receive the all clear signal from Karla. But taking a cautious approach you continue to scan the floor. You notice you have picked up two shadows. Dressed in common clothes they may have fooled a newcomer but you had spent your first week studying every guard. These two are no players they are casino guards and they are following you.

---

## Re: Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-03 14:28:40)

Dexter noticing the two new shadows he picked up decides that today is not his lucky day after all and decides his little sceem has been found out and is going to have to possiably cut his looses and find some where alittle more friendly. He stops at one of the other tables and sets down placing his bet of 25 credits he plays the game as anyone else in the casino does.
((OCC: I want to try to play like i havn't noticed the guards to see if they are truely interested in me or something else.))

---

## Re: Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-05 10:49:57)

You continue your cautious gambling though you only manage to break even. After a while you notice your shadows have moved on, now watching another patron.
Just as you where about to check in with Karla the dealer dryly announces â€œSabacc, you are the winner.â€ Weird you think to yourself. You did not have a strong hand. The dealer motions for a casino official.
Another Munn flanked by two heavy set Gammorriens approach you from behind. The tall Munn states â€œCongratulations sir, you are tonightâ€™s winner!â€ Several patrons cheer at your good fortune and streamers fall from the ceiling. The Munn looks to his guards â€œCome this way to claim your prize.â€

---

## Re: Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-05 12:51:04)

"Well, I guess today is my lucky day." As Dexter starts to stand to follow the guards to what ever prize he was going to collect he smoothes his tunic slyly trying to check his hold out because this seems to good to be true. "Well shall we gentlemen." Dexter motions for the guards to lead the way. "So, I was not awhere that there was a contest going on today. What is it that I have won?" Dexter smiles and trys to give off a friendly air.

## Re: Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-06 13:35:19)

The Munn motions to the back area of the casino floor. The two Gamorreans take flanking positions beside you and walk you to the back. The casino floor continues its gaming as you pass. You take note that none of your questions are answered. Karla still dances on stage, she does not seem to notice your little group.
The trio walks you out the back closing the door locked behind you. The Munn smiles and says â€œThis way sir, Grumbo himself will award your great fortune today!â€
The back area is little more then a series of corridors circling the main floor. Tan stone walls with arched ceilings give way to poor lighting. Periodically doors are positioned throughout the corridor. As your group continues one Gamorrean walks beside you the other behind and the Munn in leads the way.
A quick check on your weapon, its secure and ready should you need it. You pass a several closed doors before passing an open door. The scene inside send shivers down your spin. Inside a barren room is Bandous bound to a chair with two Gamorreans working him over. His face is almost unrecognizable, itâ€™s obvious the beating has gone on for some time.
The Munn stops at a large durasteel blast door and knock three times. A small slit opens and a pair of eyes asks â€œWho goes there?â€
The Munn answers calmly â€œOpen up Gelt itâ€™s me Ta`hat. I have todayâ€™s winner.â€ The door opens to a lavishly decorated room. Exotic drapes line the corners of the room, scantly dressed dancing girls sit on colorful pillows. Along the walls are a series of monitors all playing scenes of the casino floor. The largest of which plays a repeating recording of an individual tapping a com link. The recording repeats over and over, the individual is you. Standing in the center of the room is a well dressed Zabrak. He stands watching the monitor with his hands folded behind him, his back is to you.

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-10 11:19:48)

Dexter looks around the room not liking the look of the man who was being showed a crime boss loving care. "Wow, I hope I won a speeder bike I have been looking at one it would making getting around easier." Dexter not being fooled that this was not a trap and that his little sceem. "Really must say that you have a great casion here. I have had alot of fun comming here." He looks at the guards at his sides and smiles. "Well I can see that you are very busy here and if you don't have time. i can come back later and collect my prize."

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-10 12:02:47)

With your last remark the door locks behind you. Ta`hat moves in front of you and bows to the Zabrak â€œMy lord.â€ Ta`hat looks back to you and sneers â€œThe scammer as you had requested.â€
Behind you one of the Gamorreans gives you a shove forward with a grunt.
For a moment the Zabrak stands with his back to you. Still watching the monitor Grumbo speaks â€œI can see the fun you have had within my establishment.â€ His voice is calm his words spoken with no emotion at all. â€œUnfortunately it has been at my expense.â€
The Gamorrean behind you smacks his fists together.
You see no windows, no doors other then the main door. Rumor has it that Grumbo`s office was built into a bunker. Grumbo taps a control cylinder which pauses the playback. â€œWhat do you propose we do for compensation?â€

"Well, I guess sence I am caught no point in denining what I did. The only thing I can do is offer my skills as payment for what I took. Would this be satisfactory to you, or am I going to become like that gentlemen i passed in the hall." Dexter knows that he is screwed and needs to talk his way out of this if he can.
((OCC: Persausion Check +3 to talk him into not killing me.)

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-11 10:55:30)

The room falls silent all awaiting Grumbo`s response. â€œIt is obvious you do have some skill.â€ Still his voice is without emotion, he continues to stand with his back towards you. He clicks the control cylinder again and an image of Karla appears.
She is still dancing on stage oblivious to your predicament. The casino floor is business as usual as the patrons continue with their gambling. â€œI will consider your proposal. Though you are far too, free willed.â€ Grumbo snaps two fingers, which prompts two Gamorreans to his side.
â€œTake our guest into the next room. Put him in with his associate, make sure he is entertained.â€ With a dismissive wave of his hand the Zabrak waves the guards away.
Smiling the two Gamorreans grab you by the arms and begin to drag you out the door. A very uncomfortable feeling hits you when you see the smiling Gamorreans.

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-11 11:14:52)

*"Oh Firefak!* Dexter thinks to himself. "Hey guys there is no need be so ruff." Dexter trys to make agood showing of himself by pretending to stuggle agaist them. "So hows the working conditions around here? I think he will make a great boss." Dexter keeps a look out for his chance to escape or try to keep himself alive long enuff to find away out.

---

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-14 15:02:27)

The two Gamorreans grunt out a mocking laughter as they drag from the room. Just before the door closes you hear Grumbo request â€œBring her to me.â€ Remebering the last image on the screen was Karla.
The guards drop you to the floor with a thump. The room is barren of furniture except one chair. No windows and only one door. The room is cold to the touch the floor damp. The tan walls have a slight tinge of red, from the looks of Bandous its not hard to tell how.
In the center of the room Bandous sits limp and bound to a chair. His face is bruised and bleeding. You can hear his labored breathing he appears unconscious. The Gamorreans slam the door shut leaving you and Bandous alone in the room.

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-17 13:49:14)

"Well my friend, it appears that you and maybe destined to share a semalar fate." Looking the man that had helped him set this now traject mess into motion. Looking around the room and realizing that someone else (Namely Kitty) is about to be drawn into this mess. Taking stock of his opption how every small they are. "Well time to figure away out of here." Dexter says quitely to himself.
((Perseption check. +3 see if there is any means of escape.))

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-18 09:38:25)

Looking at Bandous you get no further signs that he could be roused any time soon. Looking around the room and seeing the stone walls no windows and one door you are doubtful of any escape except through the singular entry. Pressing your ear against the door you can hear two Gamorreans in their gruntal language conversing. After some time they do leave you can hear their snorting laughter as they move through the outside corridor.
Bandous begins to sir by this time. The blood on his face has long since dried up but he is swollen almost unrecognizable. "Wha ... who is there? .... D ... Dexter is that *Bandous throws himself into a fit of coughing spitting up blood as he does, he is in bad shape* Dexter you have to .... run Dexter get out they will get you too." Struggling against the ropes Bandous does not look like he could take another beating.

---

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-19 01:52:55)

"Well I am trying to figure that out right now my friend. I am sorry I dragged you into this mess." Pulling out his hold out, he takes aim at the lock. "I should have planned better. I guess that is what I get for getting greedy. Hopefully next time things will go better." With that he pulls the trigger.

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-21 09:03:05)

Taking careful aim at Bandous`s binding you squeeze off a shot, wincing as if that could reduce the noise of the blast. The ropes fall to the floor and Bandous slumps into the chair. "We *bandous goes into another fit of coughing* we where both greedy. It may have been my fault."
Within this bunker not much of the outside can be heard so it is no small measure when sirens can be heard. Bandous listens and says "Air raid sirens, they are only used to clear the sky`s. Someone important must be coming to town."
Bandous attempt to get up but his strength fails him the first try. Falling back Bandous uses the chair as a crutch to get up with a groan of resistance. "Whats the plan boss, I for one do not wish to be a Rancor appetiser."

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-22 00:26:12)

"Well, frist we have to get out of here, and then out of town or off planet." Dexter thinks alittle trying to remeber any contact he hadin town that might be able to help out. "Hopefully we can get Kitty out as well. I wonder ifI can blast us out of here." Taking aim at the lock he uses the excitment outside to his advantage. He carefully pulls the trigger.
((OCC: Aim fire, Att.+6, damage 3d4+1))

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-25 11:17:24)

Bandous struggles to maintain his footing against the pain â€œWait! Donâ€™t shot they will hear it.â€ Bandous looks around then sneers at the mention of Kitty â€œWho do you think gave us up! She is no good we are on our own.â€
Bandous limps over to the wall and begins to feel around â€œThere must be an access panel here somewhere.â€ Bandous becomes quiet for a moment â€œI am sorry my friend this may have been my fault. Some would call it greed but my reasoning was pure. Still feeling along the wall Bandous continues â€œI have been funneling funds to the rebels. I have a local contact who has been helping me. I was going to join them, still will if I get out of here.â€

---

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-11-29 16:20:38)

"What do you mean Kitty betrayed us? She would never!" Looking around the room again, Dexter can she nother way out other then the doorway. "What are you looking for anyway, I don't think there are any hatches or access panels in this room. Would be silly to lock us in here if there was."
This was getting to be to much for even Dexter to handle, and he prided himself on being able to handle alot. "So can your friends in this Rebellion get us off planet. And what is it going to cost me, cause nothing is free."

---

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-01 10:33:39)

Still a little rasped with his voice Bandous states â€œShe did sorry man face it, she is a slave. She probably thought it would get her some credit with Grumbo.â€ Bandous continues to feel along the wall high and low now. â€œIf we can avoid shooting our way out that would agree with my sense of survival. Besides remember I work maintenance here most rooms have an access panel.â€
Bandous pauses trying to regain some of his strength. Holding his side you can see a red stain forming in that area. He is most likely struggling with a few broken ribs. â€œThey will aid most anyone who opposes the empire.â€ Bandous spits on the ground to announce his dislike of the empire. â€œIf we make it out of here I will introduce you to them. They might even have some honest work for us.â€

---

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-12-01 13:01:00)

"Honest work huh? Not exactlly my thing but I will here what they have to say. You need any help find ing what you are looking for?" Dexter keeps an eye on the door incase they get company. " You know I bet my teachers back at Spy Net Academy prodicted this would happen to me. Probably bet I would die in some backwater by the hands of some crime lord's goon." Dexter starts to chuckle abit at the fact that he missed afew things he should have seen with this scam and it might cust him big if he doesn't get out of here.

---

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-03 09:51:42)

Bandous starts to chuckle at your comments but stops quickly and winches at the pain. â€œHonest work is a loose term, lest just say its aa honest as one can get in the galaxy today.â€ Through his searching Bandous has covered most of the area around the door. Looking like he is about to give up you hear a soft click.
â€œAh sabaac!â€ Bandous starts to chuckle again. â€œFrag this does not look good.â€ Motioning for you to take a look Bandous reveals an open control panel. â€œIts security protected by a small ray shield. Inside looks simple enough but I would suspect at least trip alarms.â€
Looking inside you see a series of colorful blinking lights with some solid. A common enough terminal except you can see and hear the ray shield humming over top the access panel.
Looking at you Bandous attempts a toothless smile â€œYou did not think they would make this easy did you?â€

---

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-12-03 13:20:58)

"Well no not really, but we are not sunk yet. Just got to figure away to get the ray shield down and then we are home free." Dexter looks over the terminal and tries to figure out ifhe can get the shield down without letting anyone know. Searching around in pockets looking for his security kit to help with the by pass.

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-05 11:15:16)

Bandous slides down the wall taking a seat. You can see him starting to fade into unconsciousness and back. Perhaps these friends of his can help. One thing is certain Bandous will be little help in a fight.
With skill that would impress and spy net professor you tackle the security grid on the panel. Working quickly you hear a soft beep just before the ray shield powers down. Rechecking your work, you see no signs of alarm. Silently thanking professor Melen`s lesson on If you can not bypass reroute.
Cautiously you check over the panel inside, good no trips no back up alarms of any kind. You now have full access to the panel. Before you can decide what to do with it the sounds of laser cannon fire can be heard from outside. Heavy equipment by the sounds of it. Then all hell lets loose when behind you the outside wall is ripped away from the building.
In a whirl of stone and metal you make out a Tie fighter crashing into the building. Your cell now in rubble is exposed to the outside air. The arid air rushes in, itâ€™s a miracle you where not injured.

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-12-07 02:13:03)

"Sithspawn!!! There is a full on battle going on out there." Dexter quickly puts away his tools and quickly picks up his friend and moves to the newly made exit. "Come on my friend let's get you to your friends and away from this."

---

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-11 13:09:26)

Off to the left the blur that was a Tie fighter settles into a nearby shop with a crash. Rubble from the building crashes and falls to the ground. The Tie itself had taken almost half the back end of Grumbo`s with it.
Wide eyed Bandous quietly states â€œBy the dunes.â€ Bandous quickly pats himself down. Satisfied that all his limbs are there he follows after you. â€œThought I soiled myself there for a moment, that was a close one.â€
Outside the locals have scrambled for cover. In the skyâ€™s you see several Ties angrily ascending in hot pursuit of several snub fighters.
The rubble that was Grumbo`s is slowing your progress, and Bandous`s injuries slow your escape that much more. â€œIf we can get a speeder and leave town my friends can give us shelter.â€ Bandous struggles as he climbs over a chunk of wall.

---

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-12-14 01:12:01)

Putting away his Security kit, Dexter helps his friend out of what was left of the building and heads for safety. "I need to get back to my room and get the rest of my gear then we can see your friends. Got alot of stuff that would be very bad if it fell into the wrong hands." Helping his friend with one arm and hold is weapon in the other. "Man I wonder what set this off. Someone must have cheated Vader out of some credits or something."

## Re:Fortune

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-18 15:02:41)

With your help Bandous clears the rubble. Many of the streets have cleared and only a few wondering local remain and they are frantically searching for cover of any kind. Still the battle rages over head, both sides have suffered losses but you know the losses mean little to the empire. These guys are brave or foolish to take on the empire, but if it was not for them you would still be trapped.
Your rental unit is only a few blocks away. Bandous does his best to keep pace with you. "We need to hurry this battle will distract Grumbo`s goons for so long. Even Grumbo will want to know how is guests are."
As if on que the door to your cell opens. You see two Gammorreans in the door way looking around confused, an easy race to confuse. Snorting one points your way The other lets out a grunt the jumps down into the rubble. Both Gammorreans begin to give chase after you.

## Re:Fortune

### **ganthet** (2008-12-26 12:40:11)

"Oh Firefak! This is not what we need right now. Find cover i'll handle them." Dexter pulls out his hold-out and takes aim at the two goons giving chase. Dexter knows he has to end this quickly or they are dead.

Both Gamorreans let out bellows of rage grunting out as they charge your direction. Between you the rubble that was the casino wall hinders their advancement. Angrily the Gamorreans push through the rubble, both holding large axes.
Holding your pistol steady you squeeze off a shot. Cursing under your breath your aim hits low missing the target but leaving a carbon score on a chunk of rubble.
Bandous makes slow progress towards a nearby alley â€œDex hurry lets go before more come.â€
The two Gamorreans continue to wade through the rubble to close the distance

Under pressure and running out of options you pull the trigger taking aim at the lead guard. Your aim is true and the Gamorrean takes the blast in the stomach. Too stupid to realize it is dead the brute manages to take another step before falling face first into the rubble.
His companion seeing his the other fall roars as he continues through the rubble. Axe held high you are not sure what he is saying or if it is even words in his language but the intent to end you in one swing is obvious.

Shaking you take a deep breath trying to hold aim on the brute. With a quick flash of your blasters barrel the Gamorrean grunts out in pain as your blast strikes his torso. The large brute merely howls in pain, no anger and continues on. Wide eyed at the spectacle you quickly back step ending your pace with your back against the wall of a neighboring building.
With a singular focus the brute shakes of his wound and crashes through the debris. In a rush the Gamorrean advances towards you axe held high overhead. His step ends just before you. Toe to toe against the thug, its foul breath on your face adding to the planets already hot air.

Combat especially close quarters combat was something better left to the soldier types. This is the type of situation most try to avoid. But when presented with the right amount of encouragement most any being can find bravery. Eyes half closed you fire your blaster.
The Gamorrean stands mouth open staring at you with a blank expression. Its axe begins to descend rapidly from its overhead position. Everything seams to stop you can almost hear the blade slice through the air as it closes in on you. The axe slams into the ground near your feet. The Gamorrean looks to take another step forward before slumping to the ground himself.
A few feet away Bandous stands holding a scrap of metal. â€œCome on we have to go!â€

Stun for amount Dexter realize that he is not dead. In fact he is quite alive. Looking around he sees his friend standing there with a piece of metal in hand covered in blood. "Thank you. I thought I was dead." Hearing Bandous telling him to hurry up he start moving toward his apartment. "Got to grab my gear. This way."

Racing through the streets as fast as Bandous`s pace will allow. You make way back to your rental unit. No one pays much attention to the two of you even with Bandous`s injuries. This section of town populates the lower dredges of the city, most keep to themselves. The multi level tan building posses an issue for Bandous with his injuries but with your assistance you enter the unit.
The skies above still hold patrols of Tie fighters but the battle has ended. The local populace begins to fill the streets again as do units of stormtroopers. The troopers patrol the streets in groups of three stopping to harass every other citizen.
Quickly you gather your belongings while Bandous takes a moment to rest. â€œWe need transport to Mos Eisley. My friends will help us there.â€ Bandous starts to lose consciousness, fading in and out his injuries are bad he will need medical attention. â€œA â€¦. Droid. Find SN-OP in â€¦ cantina. The Meltdown CafÃ©. Take us â€¦.â€
Bandous slumps over in his chair. Checking his vitals he is alive and stable for now. For now you are alone.

Dexter moves his friend very carefully over to the bed and lays him down.  Pulling out his only med pac out of his utility belt he try to dress his wounds and make him as confornt ablr as ppossiale. Taking his time to try not to do more harm then good.
After he finishes that and cleans up he heads out of his apartment to find this cantiana where he would make the contacts to get out of here. "The Meltdown Cafe huh sounds like an interesting place. Hope it is more friendly then the last place I was." talking to himself.

After applying a few bandages Bandous seems to stabilize some what. His breathing becomes regular and he falls into a deep sleep. The rest will do him some good the trip from Bestine to Mos Eisley will take some time and you will need transportation.
Stepping outside you scan the crowds both looking for answers and Grumbo`s goons. Finding neither you walk towards the market streets trying to blend into the crowds.
Merchants of all sorts shout out their wares.
-â€œGandies for sale fresh live Gandies.â€
-â€œThe finest cloth in town, silks from across the dunes. Come one come all!â€
-â€œWater get your water here. Quench your thirst live another day.â€
All trying to cut a profit, some more so then others. Locals buy and trade throughout the streets. Checking your credit stash you curse under your breath only 75 credits to your name. By now you can assume that Karla has cleared out the casino stash or has told Grumbo about it.
Feeling a pat on your back you spin around. Face to face with a foul smiling Gran merchant dressed in brown sand caked robes. â€œAh friend you look tired. Why walk when you can ride! I sell the cheapest Dewbacks this side of the dune sea. For a mere 50 credits I will even throw in a cart as well. You will find no better deal I say.â€ The merchant motions to a side alley where inside several Dewbacks, and a few rudimentary dura-steel carts are held.

Dexter turns around and looks at the Gran. Sizeing him up Dexter smiles. "That is a fair price my friend. I am but a humble traveler and I cannot aford the price, If I could maybe pay you say 35 credits for one of your fine animals and a cart. I have a friend who is sick and needs to reach a doctor or I am afriad he will not be with use long. If you could help me woith this i would tell all my friends of this and bring you more bussiness and that is always good is it not?

The Gran smiles â€œAh friend you try, you try to dive the bargain of hard. â€œThe Gran looks around then back to you. â€œI can sell you that nag of old back there. Make it far she might not though.â€ By the look of your face when you seen the wrinkled old Dewback with multiple insects flying around it the Gran continues to drive a sale. â€œMy friend sorry am I, you try too hard but six kids have I. Many to feed say I.â€
The Gran`s broken basic has not stopped him from trying to make a sale. Behind you a speeder races by knocking over a few baskets within the market street. The speeder is followed by a trio of Rodians. They race after the first speeder firing wildly as they go. A few shattered pots later the disturbance is past and the locals continue their day.
â€œSick is your friend my Dewbacks will get you to help. Nothing is more reliable.â€ As if to empathize the statement a Dewback lets out a low roar scaring off a nearby Jawa.

"I understand my friend. Of course I would not want to deprive your lovely family of there needs. Was it 50 credits you say That does not sound to unreasonable after all. I will require one that might be able to last long then the one you pointed out to me and a cart. Do we have a deal?" Dexter hopes that the Gran will sale him a descent animal so if needed he can travel farther.

The Gran smiles and takes your credits quickly hiding them away. â€œAh my friend you have the mount of finest anywhere. Assured you does I get you where you are going it does.â€ The Gran begins to harness one of the Dewbacks to a simple dura steel cart. The cart itself is little more then an axle two wheels and a slab of dura steel with a small plank to sit on. â€œHere you are my friend my eight children thank your kindness.â€ The Gran waves as you head towards your rental unit to meet up with Bandous.
At the rental Bandous stirs as you enter â€œYou have found us transport to Mos Eisley?â€ Gathering your belongings and helping your friend to the cart Bandous remarks â€œAh â€¦. Well I guess you did the best you could.â€ Loading the cart you throw on a few blankets from the rental unit, they shouldnâ€™t miss a few. Slowly you make your way out of Bestine heading for Mos Eisley few including the local troopers pay much attention to a couple of local scavengers.
Under the twin suns of Tatooine the trip is slow and hot. For miles the desert stretches as far as the eye can see and beyond. Few venture into the desert anymore but you keep a constant vigilance for signs of danger. Looking to the horizon a single ball of fire streaking towards the desert floor it is followed by several others. The first ball of fire slams into a nearby sand dune not too far ahead of you. Its hard to tell but the crashed ball of fire appears to be made out of metal, possibly a small ship of some sort.

"Great! Frist it is thugs and a full on battle now the galaxy is trying to smash me with parts of ships! Great!" Dexter hands his friend his hold out and jumps off the cart. "Stay here i will check it out." He draws his blaster pistol and moves toward the metal flameing ball.
