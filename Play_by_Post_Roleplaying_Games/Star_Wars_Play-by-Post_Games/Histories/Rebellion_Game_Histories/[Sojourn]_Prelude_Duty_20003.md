Itâ€™s been a few months since you left the Juunpar 3. You have found employment hard to come by, many employers prefer not to hire on non-humans despite their skills. Forced into the outer rim territories you have found a temporary base of operations, The Crusty Spacer. This seedy cantina with its questionable clientele does have one quality. In this part of Tatooine employment for pilots comes regularly.
Sipping your drink has become the norm, the burly human bar keep allows patrons to stay as long as they order. Few conversations transpire even among shared tables, and the few that do are hushed.
The dim cantina lighting is interrupted by the entrance of new patrons. Different from the rest this crew is boastful in conversation among themselves:
-â€œHey did you see me loop that transport on the way in?â€
-â€œI buzzed the cockpit, bet that pilot needs a fresh change of clothes now.â€
Judging from their conversations they are not employers so most pay no attention to them. From the corner of your eye you see the lead pilot stop and begin to order drinks, his red jump suit matches his crew.
-â€œAfter burners for my squad!â€ This is followed by cheers for the Reapers. â€˜By the stars, no way! Look here its little Kasga!â€
You are assaulted by a hug and pats on the back, as you realize its Kirn your older brother. A few years older then you he had left the home stead before you. It did not go over well with father and since then its been a rare event to even hear from Kirn.
With him are four other pilots all in the similar red flight suits. Two are Duro`s though you do not recognize them, one is human Corellian from the look of his beard and the last a goofy looking Gungan.

Kasga replys incredulously, "Well, if it isn't the Hrato's Black Nerf. You're setting-down far from home. Who's your crew?"

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-28 13:45:09)

AT Kasga`s question Kirns crew all boast in unison "Reaper Squad!" Kirn himself merely throws a sly look. You reconize that look, the one where he had something he thought everyone else wanted.
A serving droid rolls over with a try of after burners the reapers take their fill. Kirn orders another "One for my little bro as well."
The crew takes a seat at your table, none of them asked. Some even grabbing chairs from other near by tables. Kirn rubs your head with his knuckles. You can still see that care free attitude in his action but his eyes tell a different story. This is not the Kirn you grew up with, he has seen and done much since his departure.
Taking a healthy sized drink Kirn wipes his chin "So little Kasg where have you been? Does father know where you are?"
The reapers begin to drink you can hear them bragging about squad missions. Even if they are exaggerated they FLY! They are out there in the thick of it!

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-10-28 14:04:25)

At the mention of the drink, Kasga quickly puts his aside and exclaims, "An Afterburner! Those are much better than this. It tastes like something I drained out of the scrubbers."
Speaking forlornly, Kasga says, "Ah, Kirn. I've been stuck on this rock for 4 months. My last contract forced me to take a crew slot buyout so they could carry some corp muckity-muck. The money was reasonable, but I haven't been able to get passage out. All the ships that show up haven't had spare berths or need crew slots filled. I'm getting desperate. I was even thinking of stowing away on one of the droid haulers just to get back to a populated system. "
Kasga continues in a resigned manner, "As for Dad, he knew I was coming out here, but as money started to run tight, couldn't keep paying for Holonet access to send letters. I bet I haven't sent a shout home in a couple months. "
Kasga looks up hopefully and asks, "Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a crew slot? You know I'll work for it. I wouldn't ask if I wasn't so desperate."
NB. For Duros with ship experience, to become a stowaway is like becoming a bum.

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-29 12:16:21)

You finish your plead to Kirn and then take a drink of your after burner. Remembering to blow it out first. The Reapers all look at each other, looks of concern cross their faces.
Kirn breaks the silence and slaps you on the back. â€œI guess the force is with us today.â€ He sees your confusion with the expression he just used and reassures you â€œIts and expression, many who work with me started using recently.â€
The Reapers let up a cheer at that, though you do hear some of them voice concerns as well.
-â€œKirn I am all about family but can he fly?â€
-â€œHow good is he in a fight? He looks a little stringy to me.â€
Kirn raises a hand which ends their discussion. â€œI will vouch for him, he has been flying since before he could walk.â€
The rest of the afternoon is spent laughing, sharing war stories and a few card games. The Reapers are a good bunch. You learn that the two Duro`s Juris and Ooris L`Lnnar are brothers. They grew up with the space stations above Duro`s. Both brag about their pilot skill which also leads to them arguing about which is better. Seth Charr a reserved human from Corellia laughs along with the others but shares little of himself. The man sits sipping his drinks listening to the explotes of the others. The Gungan Yossen seams to be the comedian of the group and very talkative. More then a few times Yossen is asked to shut up.
Finishing up Kirn stands â€œWe have work to do boys lets roll.â€ Looking at you Kirn asks â€œTime to start earning your keep.â€ He whispers to you â€œDonâ€™t let me down bro.â€

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-10-29 13:54:27)

Kasga is looks confused about the concern coming from the Reapers about a fairly nominal work passage request. He wonders a bit about what they're doing that involves fighting. Relieved that Kirn vouches for him, he looks over at his brother with a question in his eyes.
Kasga joins in the war stories a bit. He's sure to share as many stories about his actions outside of a cockpit as possible, including the raid on Coudesca clan hauler. That story doesn't show him at his best, but at least it demonstrates that he can keep his head in a firefight. Kasga is a bit cash strapped, so he'll just heckle during the card games. He'll try to stay our of the L'Lnnar contest as much as possible and move to talking with Yossen whenever they go at it too hard. Kasga is a bit cash strapped, so he'll just heckle during the card games. During the course of the afternoon, Kasga will try to work out from the context of the conversation what kind of ship this group is flying.
Kasga gets up with the others, but when Kirn wispers to him, Kasga responds with,"I haven't let you down yet, but I need to get some stuff before we raise ship."

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-30 09:38:36)

Kirn looks to you and smiles. â€œNo little brother you have never let me down.â€ With their matching red flight suits they are obviously part of an organization, though they wear no insignia. Walking the streets with your brother gives you some comfort.
Along with your brother and the reapers you head to one of the many ground landing bays. The mood of the reapers changes suddenly. They cease their banter and continue with a more serious attitude. Even Yossen who you did not believe could close his mouth has taking to a rear sentry position.
Inside the landing bay are several dated headhunters in various degrees of disrepair. The ships are guarded by thuggish looking Gammorreans holding nasty looking axes. A lone Zabrak approaches your group, his hand extended in a wave. â€œAh welcome Kirn, lets us get to business.â€ His voice is smooth; his colorful clothes suggest a level of comfortable living most Tatooine citizens never see.
You notice the Reapers taking up flanking positions around Kirn. Kirn gives you a nudge with his elbow and whispers â€œFollow our lead.â€

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-10-30 10:39:56)

On the streets of Tantooine, Kasga walks relaxed. For the first time in weeks, hope returns.
Walking into the landing bay, Kasga stiffens at the tense environment. Hope disintegrates like shattering glass. Explanations will have to wait for later.
Kasga settles in beside Seth Charr. He tries to keep his awareness light and loose. As he engages in a perimeter sweep, Kasga familiarizes himself with the cover available and gauges the timing he would need to get there. His next consideration is sniper positions.
OOC Perception +8 to notice new targets and to locate cover.

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-31 08:58:21)

The Zabrak looks around to you and the reapers. â€œI would hope we can continue without interruption. I would hate it if a misunderstanding slowed business.â€
Kirn nods then waves at the Zabraks guards. â€œJut Kast I asure you there should be no interruptions.â€ He looks back to the reapers â€œMy squad has come to guarantee that.â€ Kirn then looks around to the Gammorrean guards â€œAs I am sure they will be here to prevent and misunderstandings.â€
The two stand motionless sizing each other for a moment before Jut breaks the silence and motions to a small office to the edge of the landing bay. â€œCome friend I have much to sell and you have buying to do.â€ Kirn follows Jut into the office leaving you the reapers and the Gammorreans alone.

---

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-10-31 14:10:38)

Kasga is a bit uneasy having his brother wander off alone with such a suspicious person. The rest of the Reavers seem tense, but not specifically about that, so Kasga keeps his eyes on the Gamorrans.
Kasga takes a good look around the landing bay looking at the ships and parts scattered about. He further continues to assess the layout tactically. He spots several lanes of fire and locations where overlapping fields of fire are possible. During his situation assessment, he takes the opportunity to drift slowly toward cover.

---

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-05 11:29:36)

Looking around the landing bay you can see that five of the headhunters have similar red insignias. The crest represents the rebellion. Your brother has not only joined the rebellion but has become a squad leader.
The rest of the headhunters are unmarked, most likely what Kirn is haggling to purchase. You find some amount of cover behind a snub, looking over the ship to cover your actions.
You can see Kirn and Jut in conversation through the office window, from time to time they point at the various ships. Scanning the open structure you overhear Yossen mumbling under his breath â€œMesa be thinking tos hurrys, de missions being soon.â€ The other reapers all nod in agreement but stay focused on Jut`s guards.
On the upper floor of the landing bay you notice a lone Rodian. Standing within some stacked crates the Rodian is focused on the office.

---

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-05 21:36:29)

Kasga speaks aside to Seth who's closest,"Check green light on 2 o'clock high." After a slight pause, Kasga speaks a little louder for the whole squad to hear. "Hey, anybody speak Gamorran? I don't want 'em gettin' nervy if I need to hit the fresher."
Since Kasga's been looking around and is generally familiar with the layout of landing bays, he tries to figure out a way to get closer to the Rodian without being seen.

---

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-06 14:09:15)

You receive a series of nods at your mention of 2 oâ€™clock high. Seth begins to focus on the Rodian after a moment of scanning. When you ask if anyone speaks Gamorrean your only answer is a synchronized shoulder shrug from the reapers.
The landing bay itself is a single large open area with several storage areas along the wall. The only visible room is the office. The second floor is little more then a walkway currently used to store various crates.
You are able to walk from snub to snub with only a cold stare from the Gamorrean guards. The Rodian stays focused on the office and seems not to notice your movements.

---

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-06 16:00:50)

Kasga continues to look around for a way to get up onto the walkway keeping his eye out for mesh tape or loose cabling he can pocket. While under cover, Kasga will quietly set his blaster pistol to stun.
OOC I'd like a bit more information about the environment. Is the walkway mounted securely? Is it suspended from the ceiling, so it will sway when Kasga steps on it and alert the Rodian? Is a stealthy approach even an option? How can Kasga get up there? Is there a ladder? Can he climb up on one of the snub fighters and jump to the walkway? Is the Rodian armed? Could the Rodian cover most of the landing bay with a blaster from that position? Does he have a comlink? In Kasga's wanderings could he acquire some loose cabling to tie the Rodian up with?

---

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-07 22:28:49)

Gently removing his Travotti Service Blaster from his hip holster, Kasga starts climbing the stairs to the walkway. Focusing on putting his feet down gently, Kasga takes his time trying to get close to the Rodian without being noticed.
OOC Stealth +5 I'd probably use knack if needed

---

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-10 10:44:54)

The stairs and walkway are clear of debris making it much easier to traverse. As you begin to ascend the stairs Yossen addresses the Gamorreans. â€œMessa wasa drinking, yousa be hasen?â€ The Gamorreans all turn to each other with looks of further confusion.
With Yossen`s cover you are able to close the distance on the Rodian. Overhead a trio of Ties scream by. You hear a faint double click on your comlink, the shared squadâ€™s frequency. Inside the office Kirn looks to his com, the message must have been meant for him.
Now a mere ten meters from the Rodian you spot a rifle at his side. The Rodian begins to take aim at the office with the rifle. A few crates still provide him cover to his sides.

---

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-10 14:11:04)

Hearing Yossen speak, Kasga breifly wonders if someone else has taken up rear guard. Not able to help with that, Kasga moves up the stairs quietly. Kasga had hoped to capture the Rodian without provoking a firefight. However, upon seeing the Rodian take aim toward his brother, Kasga recognizes that he must act. Squeezing off one blaster bolt from behind, Kasga prepares to fire again and move closer.

## Re:Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-11 10:33:06)

Taking a breath you squeeze the trigger. At the sound of your blaster discharge the Rodians eyes widen. You have the advantage of surprise, taking a knee behind a crate to focus your shoot it goes wild dissipating against a crate to his side.
Bellow on the landing bay floor the Reapers jump into action against the Gamorreans. You can see a few blaster stun shoots being fired, followed by some angry snorting from the Gamorreans.
From your position you can barley make out the office. At this vantage point and with your focus on the Rodian you do not have a clear view inside the office.
The Rodian regains his composure quickly. With trained precision he changes targets to his immediate threat, you! The Rodian snaps around to your direction his rifle ready. The Rodian mouths a curse at you as he fires â€œScutta!â€
Bellow the battle continues though the Gamorreans grunts are fewer now.
To your relief the Rodians shoot goes wildly overhead. You notice the Rodian preparing to take another shoot as he uses the crates cover to his advantage.

## Re:Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-11 15:06:30)

"Furglutz" Kasga curses. Thinking to himself. This Rodian is pretty good, going from being shot at from the blue and returning fire quickly. At least he's off Kirn. Now we're in a stand off. Kasga needed to turn this around and quickly. Kasga found himself wishing for a grenade. Startled, Kasga reaches for his comlink and hunkers down behind cover waiting for the next shot to come. He needed to time this just right...
OOC Holding action until the Rodian fires again.

## Re:Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-14 15:01:48)

Still cursing from behind his cover the Rodian snaps of another shoot. Waiting for an opportunity you kneel behind your crate a blaster pistol in one hand your comlink in the other. The Rodian is good his shoot blasts through a small gap between your crates. With a level of skill mixed with luck you manage to move your head back just in time, though the effort winds you some. This guy is playing for keeps! That shoot was meant to finish you quickly.
With a shout you throw your comlink â€œFire in the hole!â€ The comlink lands beside the Rodian. You hear it beeping faintly as you managed to activate it.
Eyes opened wide the Rodian jumps out from behind his cover, ducking his head in a roll. The Rodian Kneels with his head down using the crates for cover against an explosion that will never come. His focus is intent on you, he smiles as he discovers the ruse. The Rodian changes weapons producing a vibro blade for close combat.
With the Rodians cover gone he is open for a quick shoot. You line up your shoot for a finishing blow. Your shoot hits home punching into his shoulder. You can see the Rodian grit his teeth as the energy surges through his body. The Rodian sways slightly as he begins to stand. The Rodian rushes forward with a snarl. He quickly closes the remaining nine meters between you. His movements are more sluggish then before but he manages to stop ontop of the crate you had for cover. His blade held high ready to swing.

Puffing a bit, Kasga tracks the Rodian's movement. This guy is right on top of him. Without cover, Kasga's not about to wait around to get cut. Snapping off a quick shot, Kasga slides back slow away from the hand with the vibroblade. This could get dicey if the Rodian pushes him too far toward the stairs...

## Re:Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-18 09:38:41)

With the Rodian now on top of you and angered it is difficult to maintain a comfortable distance. Now completely absorbed by your skirmish you can barely hear the combat below. Snarling the Rodian drops his blade in a downward swing, while you squeeze the trigger launching another blast towards your target.
The Rodians swing nearly conects with your chest forcing you to jump back. The thrust of your withdrawal gains you some distance from the Rodian but pushes your body to the limit.
Rushed with your shot and still a little winded your shot strikes true, hitting the Rodian in the leg. The Rodian grits his teeth staring at you in anger. For what seams like a moment the Rodian holds his focus on you, you can see the energy from your blast coursing through his body.
With a blank look on his face the Rodian falls to the ground, landing in a curled position. Down below the Reapers have finished up with the Gamorrean guards. Juris looks up to you and nods while Ooris and Seth have already started to drag the guards out of the way.
Yossen who must have ran up the stairs to aid you comes puffing up behind. Smiling at your victory "Yousen doing goo mesa be thinking."
From the office Kirn comes out still holstering his side arm. Looking up to the sky he points to another trio of ties. "Looks like our mission is about to begin we do not want to be late."
The reapers mood changes back instantly, again they are cheerful. Kirn motions for you to come down "Hey little bro we have work to do."

## Re:Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-18 11:31:41)

Giving a feral grin to Yossen, Kasga trots over to where the Rodian had been skulking. Picking his comlink up from where he threw it, he clips it onto his belt. Glancing over to the blaster rifle the Rodian was using, Kasga grabs that too. After all, around Kirn, he might get shot at again. As he runs past the Rodian toward the stairs, Kasga glances down to make sure he's still unconscious.
Kasga wends his way back through the landing bay and joins the Reapers gathered around Kirn. As the mission breifing begins, Kasga checks the rifle making sure it's in reasonable working order and not obviously booby trapped. Having checked the rifle to his satisfaction, Kasga slings it over his right shoulder and focuses on what Kirn's mission is.
OOC Perception +8 for the Rodian and the rifle

## Re:Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-21 09:03:18)

Grabbing the Rodins rifle and your comlink you do notice that the Rodian is out for now. The Rodian still rests on the floor curled up with his tongue sticking out. You must have hit him hard with that last stun. The Rodians rifle is in working order and not tampered with in any way.
Kirn motions to Yossen "I need you to get the speeder and fast." To emphasise his point air sirens go off. You have been on Tattoine long enough to know that no one attacks gangster controlled towns. The sirens are used to clear the air ways when important visitors come down.
When the Sirens go off Yossens eyes widen and he spins around three times before finding his direction "Yesum mesa being fast mesa be thinking." Yossen runs out of the hanger.
"Juris watch the doors." Kirn points to the large double doorway, the main entrance into and out of the hanger. Beyond the main door the towns folk continue on their daily routines if any of them had seen what happened inside they show no signs of interest. Juris closes the double doors and stands guard by the peephole.
Kirn motion to Seth "I need you to take care of this mess. Put them in a storage locker or something." Seth nods and begins to drag the guards away.
Looking at you Kirn smiles "Your with me little bro. Ooris take watch from the second floor." Ooris climbs the staircase and sets his electrobinoculars to the sky, he seems to be focusing on the Ties. Kirn reaches into the first snub and begins the star up routine. "We need to get all the hunters running. Run them all throw a pre-check but do not lift off. This will not work unless we all take off together."
Five of the headhunters belong to the Reapers the others to the merchant. Kirn sets to begin start up on the next snub he looks over to you. "These are already spoken for but you can take your pick of the others. Or you can back out now bro. I do not want to put you in danger but this mission could save a lot of lives and help change the tide of the war."

## Re:Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-22 16:00:20)

Kasga is shocked by this revelation. Kasga stands bewildered for a moment. Recovering, Kasga starts looking around at the Z-95s not claimed by the Reapers. Kasga picks one that still looks in reasonable repair. As he works through the startup, Kasga considers the choice his brother gave him.
Kasga remembers the long hours on the graveyard shift piloting bulk haulers for small-sized merchant companies. The merchant captains would check in every shift. Most of them were all business. They wanted a status report and to get back to their bunk. But a few would linger talking about the transport run and it's difficulties. First on the mind of these captains was the Imperial Customs ships. These ships inevitably audits the bulk haulers and found some violation or other to charge the hauling company with. The captains viewed it as a tax on trade by the mere presence of the Imperial fleet. The Empire treated these merchantmen as fodder to be milked or worse as pirates. There were plenty of stories of merchant haulers just disappearing cargo and all. Sometimes the captains would be released, but they were never the same.
The Travotti clan was larger than the small hauling companies Kasga had been working for, but Imperial taxes were constant curse on transport runs. Freqently, Travotti haulers would take routes through systems with no Imperial presence just to avoid dealing with them. That still raised overhead for the run because escort fighters had to be taken along.
The Rebellion seemed to be the only group standing up to the Empire on idealogical grounds. The Black Sun and the Hutts cared not for Imperial idealogy as long as profit could be made. It would take a major incident to cause the Hapes Consortium to intervene. If the Rebellion could make a difference in the lives of those sentients held powerless by the Empire, Kasga wanted to be part of it. Certainly, the Rebellion had a better chance of doing something significant than those bulk hauler pilots Kasga had been hanging around with lately.
Besides for all his wild antics, Kirn always did strive to for the best outcome for all. That was why he was always placed on command staff so quickly. He frequently got in trouble, but he always turned out right in the end.
Looking over at his brother, Kagsa remarks, "Ok, Kirn. I'm in. Care to explain a bit more about this mission?"

## Re:Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-25 11:29:47)

Kirn pokes his head out from within the engine housing of a snub and smiles. â€œI knew you would not let me down little bro.â€ Kirn turns and shouts to Seth â€œHey Seth! He said yes you can put the rope away.â€
Chuckling Kirn turns serious for a moment â€œNo really be careful around Seth. Youâ€™re not a Reaper â€¦â€¦. Yet but you are one of us now.â€
Ooris shouts down from the second level â€œWe have incoming, mission bound.â€ Ooris taps his comlink talking into it you can not hear what is being said. â€œYossen is inbound as well.â€
Kirn looks back to you â€œWe do not have much time. Get the snubs running. We are on a mission to take out an imperial admiral, hit and run. His shuttle is incoming.â€ Kirn races to the next snub and begins the start up.

## Re:Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-11-25 16:43:39)

Kasga is a bit dismayed about his brother's portrayal of Seth. He'd been hoping to have Seth as a wingman. If Seth isn't really all together, that might not work out.Maybe Yossen would do better.
Kasga finishes up the startup on the Z-95 for himself and looks around. He moves over to another dormant one, working in parallel to his brother so they could all get airborne.
Kasga was already sweating from the tension of the fight. The mission revelation from his brother triggers flutters in his stomach. Stilling his battle nerves, he says conversationally, "What's the escort going to be like? What's our escape plan? Are we coming back to Tantooine?"
His nervousness makes him talk too fast, so his tension is obvious.
OOC After starting one of these up Kasga should know if there's a hyperdrive installed in them. Is there?

## Re:Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-01 10:43:56)

Kirn stops for a moment noticing your concerns â€œDonâ€™t worry little bro, Seth is the best and super loyal. But he has trust issues and has become over cautious. He does not always get along with outsiders.â€
Kirn proceeds with the start up procedure on the next snub while listening to your questions. â€œWe are expecting a fair number of Tie`s and a Star Destroyer in orbit. This is an Admiral I would expect no less. Our only real concern is to hit the Admirals shuttle and run, I will transmit the escape route when we take off.â€
As Kirn gets another ship started up the gates open and a medium sized speeder enters. Yossen waves from behind the speeders controls. Inside the speeder are six older model B-1 battle droids.
Looking up from the next snub Kirn chuckles â€œAh our replacements have arrived complements of our employer.â€

## Re:Duty

### **galenbd** (2008-12-01 16:47:58)

Kasga does not feel comforted by his brother's assessment of the forces arrayed against them. Facing off the Imperial Navy in these fighters seems a bit suicidal.
Kasga keeps working on the snub fighter startup, looking up as Yossen comes in. Old battle droids seems like an unusual tool for a space based mission. Kasga waits for his brother to explain, never stopping the startup sequence he's working on.

## Re:Duty

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-03 10:09:37)

Yossen struts over to his cargo, activating each droid one by one. Yossen then points to one of the snubs as he activates each droid. The B-1 battle droids nod â€œRodger rodger.â€ And move to the assigned headhunter.
Smiling Kirn powers up one of the last snubs, just as you power your last. â€œExpendable pilots. They are not very skilled though but our employer has a stockpile of them.â€
Seth comes back from his grisly task wiping his hands on a rag. â€œBetter they take a hit then a Reaper.â€
Kirn makes a circular motion with his hand raised in the air he lets out a sharp whistle â€œMount up boys.â€
Juris Ooris and Yossen hoot as they race to their snubs. Seth casually rechecks his systems after you had run the start up, and then gives a thumb up.
Kirn enters his headhunter and puts his flight helmet on. Entering your snub you can hear Kirn over the comlink. â€œOk Reapers most of you know the mission. Stay tight and be ready for changes.â€ Kirns ship is the first to lift off followed by the other Reapers and then the droids. You notice a sub menu on your display giving you simple control over one droid. Itâ€™s a simple interface to follow back or front.

Clearing the docking bay walls the towns buildings come into view. Most traffic is pedestrian and land based but several Ties can be seen circling the town. Your com opens with a gruff unidentified voice â€œStand down your flight plan and land or be shot down.â€ Three Ties turn to intercept your group.

Kasga follows closely after the Reapers. Once clear of the hanger, he set his droids position to be in front of him, with Kasga flying as wingman.
Not certain what the Reapers have in mind, Kasga takes a lazy flight path flying a littl higher than the rest of the Reapers since he's at the back. Judging the distance to the larger group of TIEs as being out of range, Kasga resolves to stay away from them. Kirn was never one to mince words and Kasga knew the shooting was about to start. In case he was wrong and not wanting to look like the over eager brother, Kasga waits to confirm that Kirn plans to engage. Kasga wants to be ready to move, so he starts lining up his shot at the wingman of the lead Tie...

The other Reapers all command their droids side kicks into a forward wing position. Then the Reapers fall into position behind Kirns ship. Over the com you hear Yossen`s chatter â€œMessa being hoping this sa bing goising beta then sa practicing, ohsa boyous.â€
-Juris â€œRodger that.â€
-Ooris â€œHey Yossen I can still see the carbon score on the rear of your snub.â€
-Kirn â€œOk cut the chatter Reapers.â€
The chatter ends and Kirn opens fire on the lead Tie. His shot is true hitting the Tie, the Ties trajectory begins to waver. Seth lets his shot off which finishes the lead in a ball of fire.
Juris and Ooris both snap off shots together. Their laser blasts stream to the target knocking the Tie from its flight path. The Tie falls spinning into a local building underneath. The Tie rips through the establishment exposing many of its interior rooms.
Following everyoneâ€™s lead you fire on the remaining Tie. Yossen fires with you adding his fire power to your own. Both shots slam into the Tie sending pieces of it showering in a radius around its position.
â€œThe force is with us today boys time to hit the ceiling.â€ Kirn excitedly shouts over the com before moving his snub upwards. All the reapers follow in formation behind. Like an angry swarm the patrolling Ties move to intercept.
The droid wingmen fail to fire with your group but do ascend with your formation. Yossen Chuckles over the com â€œJusting like th sa trials.â€
Your formation closes the distance to the target displayed on your sensors. Ahead you see a Lamba class shuttle with twelve Tie escorts flying a defensive formation around it. Kirn comes over the com again â€œOk Reapers I am going to make you famous. Open the doors so I can take my shot.â€ The other Reapers begin to target the shuttle surrounding escort.

The Reapers mean business. Kasga is surprised at how fast they cleared the first flight of TIEs. The Empire won't underestimate them again. Kirn's right, they need to finish this fast.
Kasga looks at the sensor's rangefinder. Too far out for the laser cannon. They'll have to be lucky to hit me from here. The TIEs are all sitting together. Nothing like a missle to spread them out. Kasga targets the second rank on the right hand side hoping to damage some of the other TIEs in the spread.

Your droid wingmen all let a volley fire. Their shots are far to low to hit anything and fire harmlessly into the air. Seth curses over the com â€œStupid droids they still have a reaction delay. Thought we fixed that.â€
-Kirn â€œNo worries, use them as best you can or as fodder if nothing else.â€
Screaming through the sky these dated snubs hold up very well. The Reapers themselves fly with practiced skill. The whole unit would almost look like a team of aces it where not for the droids clumsy flight paths.
Kirn is first to fire, his torpedo races to its target but goes wide when the shuttle quickly compensates its course. Seth targets a Tie a curses again as it rolls out of his targeting scope. Yossen snaps a shot off grazing his targets left panel. The Tie sways but quickly regains control. Oorin and Juris both fire in unison. Ooris`s shot finishes off Yossen`s target in a ball of metal and fire. While Juris scores a hit on a fresh target.
Holding your snub steady, or trying to. Your maneuvers are distracted when your droid wingman almost collides into you. With a quick side roll you avoid the potentially crippling crash, but you lose your solid sensor contact on your target. Your missile flyâ€™s over the target Tie.
Your sensors begin to chime alerting you of a new threat. A Star destroyer comes into your outer sensor range, she is closing on your squads position from low orbit.
The shuttles escorts accelerate to attack speed. Five open fire on your squad. Your snub jolts against the impact but the shields hold. Six other Ties including the Tie Juris had hit, run straight at and into the droid wingmen. Had they been programmed better or not suffering from the reaction delay issue they might have avoided the collision.
Debris of Tie and hunter shards scatter across your shield grid. Kirn yells into the com â€œReapers all targets on the mark then run! Run! Sending evac coordinates now.â€

The battle rages on Ties swarm all around angry at your assault. On kirns command the reapers let fly torpedo's on the targeted shuttle. Juris knocks the shuttle with a hit Ooris`s shot goes wide the torp flying harmlessly through the sky. Seth rocks the shuttle with a hit of his own followed by Kirns missile. Yossens torpedo falls short, the shuttle starts to lose altitude she is hurt but not out yet.
Holding your breath you squeeze the trigger your torpedo races to its target. With the erratic movements of the shuttle you are not sure if it will hit or not. Your proximity alarm lights up the Ties are dangerously close and the patrol has closed the distance. In a ball of fire your torpedo hits ending the shuttles flight.
"Woot! Yea! Imp scum!" Cheers erupt over the com as the Reapers celibate the victory.
In retaliation the five escort Ties open fire concentrating on Yossen. In a hail of lasers Yossen struggles to avoid the storm. One manages to hit Yossens engines black smoke trails Yossens flight pattern. "I sa holding, mesa be thinks."
-Kirn "Yossen swing left we will cover you." Another volley of laser fire this time from the patrol ends Yossens flight. His ship rocks bends then explodes.
-Seth "They are on me someone give me some cover fire!" The patrol continues its assault tailing Seth`s snub now. Seth narrowly dodges the first wave of shoots but his snub takes a wing hit. Partially crippled Seth is unable to avoid the next hail. His ship breaks apart and scatters over the town.
-Kirn "Full retreat now go! Fly damn you fly!." shouting over the com Kirn is obviously upset he was never good at losing anything. The Reapers begin to scatter and roll. "Dump the ship as soon as you can we will meet up later."

Kasga figures he can handle 2 TIE fighters on his own, but doesn't want to get caught out like Ooris. If he can put some distance between the trailing TIEs and their reinforcements, he can probably down them and go to ground. The engines are hot, but holding. Time to gun it again. Kasga angles his ship a little heading deeper into the desert, keeping his eye on the sensors hoping for no further pursuit.

All around you the desert duns blast past you, an endless sea of shifting dunes. The city is behind you now and the last of the readers gone or out of your scanners range. The Ties tailing you manage to maintain their pursuit of you though have not been able to gain enough of an advantage to fire, yet. Ahead of you more Ties enter your scope trying to box you in.
Pushing the throttle forward again maybe luck is on your side today. The old snubs engines groan with protest. The whole ship begins  violently shaking as dark smoke starts to trail from your left boasters. With a few tricks your brother once taught you the ship continues on course but fails to gain any extra speed.
The sea of sand is broken below you buy a canyon running across it like a long scar. Fairly deep and littered with columns of rock it stretches for miles. It would be difficult to maneuver within but would provide cover from above. Plus a Tie pilot would have to be foolish to follow you in there.

Looking ahead to the new group of TIEs coming in, Kasga realizes he's out of time. Kasga is going be outnumbered quickly. The canyon should allow him to isolate his targets better if he can live through it. Once he's out of sight, he can power down and hide out a while.
If he's going to run that canyon, he will need the left boosters back online. Stabbing the contol panel quickly, he cuts power to the left booster hoping to prevent a complete flame out. He'll have to recalibrate the fuel injector to handle the increased power he needs for maneuvering. The Z-95 will have to do without it for now.
The canyon is pretty close, so he should be able to make it there quickly. Kasga expects to try the recalibration in canyon straight aways. He focuses on making it into the canyon without eating sand for now. His approach is on a right vector nursing the left booster a bit.

With one hand on the yoke and the other on the consol you dive into the canyon. Native lizards like creatures jump from rock to rock. As with most of Tatooine there is little to no vegetation to be seen. Along the canyon floor large bones of long dead beats rest. At this speed the scenery blurs past you as you enter a series of twists and turns to avoid colliding into the canyons many columns.
The canyon itself I causing some interference with your long range scan, but you can see the trailing Ties dive to continue the chase. Above the canyon the other Ties begin to circle like vultures. Inside the canyon he columns begin to merge closer together creating shadows throughout the canyon.

The further into the canyon you go the more concentrated are the piles of bone. Some more recent then others as small scavengers pick meals off the scatterings of flesh hanging from the bones.
Your flight path takes you under a half fallen column or rock. Next a hard left pulls your snub sideways between a pair of columns. Above you the Tie patrols begin firing on the canyon itself. Their attacks seem random but manage to topple a nearby column of rock. Instinct takes over as you pull into a hard accent over the obstacle. The maneuver takes you a little higher then intended but not above the safety of the canyon walls.
Forcing your craft further into the canyon you soon discover why so many of your pursuers refused to enter into the canyon after you. In a flash of fang and scale an ancient Kryat Dragon takes a snap at you. Pushing your engines even more you narrowly manage to slip through its jaws unharmed. .
Leaving the monster behind it does not continue its assault. Your scanners show the lead Tie enter the canyon then disappear, followed shortly by its wing man. It is possible they hit a blind spot in your sensors or crashed into the canyons teeth. So far you count yourself lucky. At these speeds one wrong turn one wrong move could total your headhunter.
Cursing under your breath the quick maneuvers distracted a few key commands on your console. The computer read out of the left booster remains unchanged.

Seeing the TIEs vanish from his scopes, Kasga heaves a sigh of relief, letting go of his combat jitters.
Looking around to the canyon, he reduces his speed a bit to give himself more buffer to maneuver. He'll continue to work on the left booster trying to get it back online. This could be a trap to spring on him when his guard is down.
Now he just needs a strong overhang so he can go silent. It needs to be able to stand up to air bombardment. It'll take the Empire a while to get organized enough to search the canyon for his fighter. Perhaps by then he can find a window to escape notice as he comes out of the canyon.

Slipping further into the canyon you almost run straight into a sheer rock face. Above the Tie patrols continue their bombardment, it will only be a matter of time before ground troops are sent in after you. Scanning the area you notice the Clift face is dotted with twisting tunnels many large enough to land inside. The only other cover you see is on the ground among the monstrous corpses and packs of scavengers.
As you continue your repairs your left engine sputters. Throughout your scans you still find no signs of the reapers. At long range more ships are heading this way but because of their numbers you doubt itâ€™s the reapers. Could be another dozen Ties and a troop shuttle.

Hopefully he can run a long way under cover and find another hiding spot. Kasga will go slow and continue to try fixing his left booster.

Your scans now show Tie fighters in every direction with the other group closing fast. Yaking another hard turnyou move to gain some distance from the crashed Ties. Tapping the computer console you get a green light from the left engine.
Ahead you can barely make out a few toppled rock columns within a cloud of recently disturbed dust. The bombardment must have knocked them over and created the dust cloud. Itâ€™s the best you have seen so for cover and a fair distance from the entrance.

Kasga ignores the grim news broadcast from the Imperial fleet. It's probably propaganda anyway. That other group of TIEs caught up fast. With so many scanners looking at him now, he really can't run any further. The toppled rock pile could hide him. As the dust settles, it should cover his Z-95 up and make it harder to spot. The terrain will also make it harder to use the bulky sensor pack the Empire likes to use in civilized areas. Kasga dials his engines down a bit to keep from blowing the dust away and comes in for a landing in the rock pile.

## Re: Duty

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-03 12:02:23)

Gently you ease your snub down. Even with your engine power reduced more dust is stirred up, adding to the cloud cover. The dust is thick and severely reducing your vision. Your snub sways back and forth as you attempt to land. Slow and steady you tell yourself donâ€™t want to make things worse with a crash landing.
With your sensors almost useless you decide to go with whatâ€™s best. Pilotâ€™s intuition. With a hard jolt your wing clips a rocky outcrop. Quickly you regain control and straighten the ships decent. Another jolt and you land hard. Finding yourself at a slant your ship settles on the canyon floor.
Powering down the ship to avoid a power signature lock you settle in for the wait. After a few hours the dust settles and the cold night sets in. The Tatooine nights can be very dangerous both from the imperial patrols native inhabitants and the predators. Throughout the night you hear the howls of many different animals even the odd blaster shot or two. At times you can see lights in the distance. The lights could be patrols or local scavengerâ€™s just two reasons among many to stay with the ship.
After a restless night you take a short walk in an attempt to scan your surroundings. Above the canyon a few Ties still maintain patrol though far fewer now. You can see columns of smoke in the distance marking possible camps sites. If they are imperial they will have scouts out as well. Itâ€™s starting to look doubtful if you will be flying out of here today.

Hours pass by. From time to time a patrol can be seen in your area. A few even get close, but with the dirt and duct cover on your ship you are well hidden. One such conversation they even get close enough for you to over hear a fair amount. Thankful for the shade cover you are able to sit by as the trooperâ€™s converse with their commanding officer then continue on.
-A trooper with the red shoulder pad marking his rank salutes the single imperial officer within the foot patrol. â€œSir we have exceeded our dead line. We have now have orders to return to ship.â€
-The tall male office returns the salute, still scanning the area he says. â€œUnderstood!â€ The officer ends his scans â€œLt Sloan organize the recall, keep the local garrison on patrol in this area. I will assume full responsibility for the failure and report directly to Admiral Scyho personally. Lt Sloan you are in charge now captain.â€
Shortly after that close encounter several transports lift off and exit the canyon. Over the next little while pairs of Ties still flyby over head. Most likely part of the local detachment from Bestine. Their runs are infrequent but you figure there are only a few patrols over the canyon now.

## Re: Duty

### **galenbd** (2009-02-10 10:02:21)

Kasga lays low for a few more hours until close to sunset. Wiggling out the maintanence hatch, he replaces the cover, then starts a preflight checklist.
Once the external checks are done, he opens the cockpit and climbs in. He continues down the preflight checklist, paying attention to the left thruster and making sure it's calibrated correctly. Once that is corrected, he turns on the ship's sensors and makes sure they are operating properly. Then he fires up the shields and makes sure those are at full as well.
Satisfied that the damaged fighter is as good as it can get, Kasga lifts up slow, then  eases the stick back for a slow rise. As his ship breaks the rim of the canyon, he does a wider sensor sweep to make sure there are no TIEs around.

This is safe-one are there any reapers out there?â€ The com stops most likely a short burst to avoid a lock. Your sensors show three patrols of Ties flying in pairs above the canyon.
With the ship holding together all systems read green your fighter is ready. More data comes streaming in from the sensors showing some ground troops now turning in your direction. The Ties above also begin to turn you must have been tagged by a scout or sensor scan. Fight or flight your heart starts racing what ever you do you are running out of time.

Your engines open up blasting you forward and out of the canyon. The Ties begin to scramble trying to box you in. With your lead they are hard pressed to do so anytime soon. The sensors on your console blare at you angrily. Your worst fears are realized the ground troops have launched ground to air missiles. Two dart rapidly towards you.
Alarms flashing you fly hard and fast. Weaving twisting you curse the barren desert floor you now race over for its lack of cover. Behind you the missiles mirror your maneuvers turn for turn. Damn them and their military grade ordinance. You manage to gain some distance from the ground troops and even the Ties. The Ties must figure you for dead and pull back on there speed to allow the missiles to do their work.
A narrow miss as you twist the snub into a spin sends the lead missile exploding into the dunes before you. But you are unable to avoid the second missile. With a jolt the missile impacts the snubs engines sending the craft forward violently. Bracing yourself you pull the ejection lever which blasts you out of the cockpit. Below you watch the headhunter break apart across the desert floor.
A change in the wind forces your parachute away from the area and down hard into the sand. On the ground and still strapped into your chair you are alive and safe, for now. It will not take long for the patrols to realize you escaped the fighter, they will begin patrolling the area looking for the pilot soon after. Of in the distance you can see the rough outline of Bestine. If you start now you should reach it by foot within a few hours.

Kasga sits stunned for a moment after that jolting ride. Then he scrambles to get himself out of the straps. Once out of the chair, he dances around a bit ranting and raving at the insanity of the universe and his brother in particular.
After that cathartic interluge, he takes stock of the storage bin in the ejector seat. It had already been raided when he got to it, so the only thing of significance is the rifle he took off the Rodian. He looks that over making sure it's still in working order, then looks around to see where he is.

Various merchants crowd any vacant space available trying to make a living with offers better then the next merchant. Not sure if you picked up attention walking into town you feel it might be wise not to stay in town longer then needed.

Using 3 credts, Kasga buys a duffle bag off of a street vender. Heading down an alley, he stuffs the Rodian's Blaster rifle in it. Wandering over to a street vendor, he buys a 5 cred meal. The pile of noodles and meat never tastes so good. Hunger is indeed the best sauce. And that food is far cry better than the few crumbs of pertified ration bar he found on the floor of the Z-95.
Trying to avoid Imperial patrols, Kasga takes a slow careful walk through Bestine around where his apartment is. If the Empire suspects him, it would not be good to go straight home and get caught. Kasga is on the look out for anyone watching his apartment or following him around.

You make your way through the local venders without incident. The odd merchant tries to haggle his prices over the norm but you are able to acquire the goods you need. Bestine streets provide you cover with its high pedestrian traffic, you are able to avoid more patrols. A short walk later you enter the residential district and your apartment. The multi story tan building is swarming with imperial troopers. A pair stands at the main entrance refusing entry to anyone who approaches. There are trios of troopers patrolling the streets. Looking up you see your apartment window open, your belongings are being tossed out. You can also see at least one of the white armored troopers inside searching your room.
Lowering you head you are passed by another trio of troopers. You overhear part of a radioed conversation with their command.
-â€œWe are looking for an individual pilot.â€
-â€œRodger that we will find the rebel scum.â€
Quickly you decide to gain some distance on this area. It would be best to leave Bestine entirely. Moving quickly but but not fast enough to draw attention to yourself you cover the next few streets. Using alley ways when possible you duck into another alley and run straight into a human male. The man looks a little frantic as though he had lost something.

As the collision occurs, Kasga braces himself against the man with his left hand. His right hand claps to the butt of his Travotti service pistol. Once he recovers his balance, he steps back and lets him go. His stance relaxes, but his hand stays casually draped over his pistol.
"Excuse me. Easy there....um...you may not want to go that way. There's an Imperial patrol combing this sector."
