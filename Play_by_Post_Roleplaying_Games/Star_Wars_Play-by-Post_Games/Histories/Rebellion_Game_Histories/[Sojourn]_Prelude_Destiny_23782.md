Dexter:
Jumping down from the cart you rush over to the crash site. Smoke rises from the area, alone the way debris litters the ground. Bandous yells from the cart â€œCareful up there. What do you see friend?â€ Looking back you see that Bandous is awake again and sitting. He waits from the cart keeping an eye out watching your back.
The hatch opens then clangs to the ground. Smoke rises from the hunk of dura steel, which as you get closer looks to be an escape pod. All markings have been worn or burned away in the crash making it impossible to tell where it came from. A lone woman with short hair pokes her head out of the pod and begins to look around. It takes her a moment before she sets her gaze on your approach. You can see she is wearing janitorâ€™s overalls, though your keen Bothan eyes notice that the overalls are too big for the woman.
Naryen:
You crack the hatch almost blinded by the desert twin suns. Hot arid air blasts into the pod. The sudden change in temperature wakes Lahelas. â€œWhat? Where are we?  Deidra oh thank the stars its you!â€
Throwing the hatch open it clangs against the dura steel hull then falls off its hinge to the ground. Smoke still rises from the escape pod, even few small fires along the hull. The pod is in bad shape it was only through solid construction and luck the two of you survived unharmed.
Scanning the area you find yourself half buried in a sand dune. Surrounding you is a sea of sand as far as the eye can see. It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the bright light. When you do regain some focus a primitive two wheeled cart comes into view. It is harnessed to a large lizard like beast of burden. On the cart an individual sits watching the area, while ahead of the cart a lone Bothan male approaches your position. The Bothan is armed and has a weapon in hand.
((you manage to find two all temp blankets and four utility belts))

"I sertently hope you are friendly cause I have ha one of those days today." Dexter looks at the human female poke her head out of the pod, the fact that her clothes are big on her is interesting but nothing important. "Might as well come out cause the desert in going to kill you if you stay in that tin can. Come on we will give you a ride to the next settlement." Dexter puts away his blaster and moves to help the woman out of the pod.

&#8230; into the incinerating wastes.
When Naryen moves from the hatch to help Lahela down, unfastening the harness, the light wakes the little girl up. â€œWhat? Where are we?Â  Deidra oh thank the stars its you!â€ Naryen almost collapses from the relief ***She seems to have made it ok. Good.*** Lahela reaches for her as she is lifted from the seat and squeezes Naryen with a hug shaking with relief & exhaustion. Naryen crouches down with her and squeezes back then holds her out at arms length. With a smile and a voice full of warmth, **"Hi."** is all she can manage. **"Let me have a look at you."** then realizes that the lighting isn't enough. With a playful smirk/scowl **"Too dark. Let me check you over before we go outside."** and motions her to stay put and climbs back to the hatchway and pushes it lightly to open it further.
The hatch falls away, off it's hinge, with a loud protesting groan and a thud to the sand below. The look that came across her face when the hatch fell away from her hand must have amused Lahela because she breaks into a giggle she stiffles with her hand. Naryen flinches away from the sudden blast of light from twin suns above. Sheilding her face with her hand, and sticking her tongue out at Lahela, Naryen moves up further to look out from the escape pod. She moves her hair off her forehead, now stuck there with some sweat, and looks out from the hatchway.
And starts to feel sick again. The sight is not reasuring. A sea of scorching death in every direction, with the oven she is in getting warmer very fast, barely a heat-moisture distortion to be had. Not good. She hazards climbing further to see other angles and notices the massive dent on one side of the pod. ***Lucked out there to be sure.*** The wind changes direction, moving some smoke curling from the sides of the pod revealing a primitive two wheeled cart harnessed to a large lizard like beast. It's difficult to make out the person on the cart but it's clear they are watching the area while a lone Bothan male approaches your position with a weapon in hand. Naryen tenses and flashes a hand-signal to Lahela to hold position and starts to reach for her holster then realizing that it and her sidearm are packed. She has just enough time inwardly curse and to wonder if the child will understand when she hears Lahela suck air through her teeth. ***Good girl***
"I sertently hope you are friendly cause I have ha one of those days today." An interesting statement to make to someone climbing out an escape pod that looks like was used for target practice. Naryens eyes narrow slightly ***And what kind of day does it look like I'm having genius?*** her gaze flicks to the gun then back to the Bothans face. "Might as well come out cause the desert in going to kill you if you stay in that tin can. Come on we will give you a ride to the next settlement." putting away his blaster and moves towards the pod.
Naryen pauses trying to size up this hairy strangerthat just happened across them seemily to offer aid on a planet of criminals and scavengers, though that was what she was told. She imagines a scoundrel handbook, if such a thing exists, and reads from the page: ***Approach with weapon drawn to show a front of cautious hostility to draw attention from the cart then holster the weapon it while showing aparant friendship. Bait the target into clearer view while the other lines up a shot from partial concealment and safe distance…*** She puts the handbook away  ***No way he could make time here with that cart, you'd need a landspeeder at least, but still…*** feeling the heat setting in. ***He's right & better to go boldy or not at all***
She fixes her gaze on his eyes, while still sheilding them from the intense and painful glare from the suns. **"Is your companion on the cart going to shoot me if I step out from here?"** Her tone is cool and casual, free of any actual acusation or challenge. Just matter of fact.

"Nope. He is good man and shooting a woman is not our style. Well unless your name is Kitty then I apped to shot you." Dexter smiles. "Come on. No harm will come to you. I promise. My name is Dexter and you might want to get a move on cause the crash is liable to atractions." Dexter continuses to walk back to the cart and wait for the person in the pod to come out and then they could leave.

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-18 11:12:34)

The twin suns beat down on the endless sands creating a haze in the distance. As you both size each other up a trio of Ties screams by over head off on another patrol. So far neither of you has seen nor heard anything threaten from each other though you should be wary you might be each other best chance to make it through the desert heat. Who knows what real threats await within the sea of sand? With the temperature rising the current threat from the twin suns become your first concern.
(At this point you are both close enough to each to add character descriptions in your next post)

## Re: Destiny

### **Rebaav** (2009-02-18 19:04:36)

Slow roasting on a spit in the bowels of neverwhere
"Nope. He is good man and shooting a woman is not our style. Well unless your name is Kitty then I apped to shot you." the Bothan smiles, as if that thought apeals to him perhaps. ***Is it common to advertise to people you've just met of any homicidal tendancies?*** "Come on. No harm will come to you. I promise. My name is Dexter and you might want to get a move on cause the crash is liable to atractions."
Naryen, now that her eyes have adjusted, watches the Bothans back as he walks away, thoughtful for a moment. ***He's right, we can't stay here.*** She turns to look at Lahela and in that moment of looking in those girls scared and trusting eyes a decision is made. Naryen just starts to smile and extend a hand, to indicate it's ok, when she hears a sound. A sound created by carefully attenuated ion exhaust thrusters. A squealing screaching whine of banshees on a hunt. A sound that she used to feel reasured by, like a guardian angel looking out for her. A sound made with a specific purpose of eliciting fear in the enemies hear it.
And Naryen felt a shock of fear ripple up her spine and flash across her face. ***So, this is what the Imperial Navy inspires. Not the confidence of an army here to protect you but here to subdue you.***
Naryen snapped up & looked around. 3 TIEs fly a sloppy formation far off. ***Must be local boys.*** In a rush she grabs the packs & thermal blanket and tosses them out. Then motions for Lahela, who moved to her out-reached arm. Naryen lowers her as far as she can then drops here to the sandy ground. Once Lahela stands up and steps aside Naryen drops next to her. Lahela picks up the blankets and Naryen the packs and they walk hand in hand to the Cart. Naryen notices Lahelas hand is shaking.
***Time to see if they're in the Empires employ.***

"Sithspit! I was hopeing to avoid anymore delays in getting to where I was headed." Dexter says as the ships go screaming over head. "Well at least it will be while before they can get ground troops out this far. They may just let the desert do the work for them." Dexter waits by the cart to help the two new arrivals up into it. " Lets get a move on. We need to get moving again."

## Re: Destiny

### **Rebaav** (2009-02-20 17:59:24)

Just as Naryen gets close enough to the care she hears the Bothan, who identified himself as Dexter, say "Well at least it will be while before they can get ground troops out this far. They may just let the desert do the work for them." This cause Naryen to start slightly. ***Ghosts of the past… not only will they risk troopers here they will certainly use repulsor tanks or some other fast and loud transport. Perhaps even a shuttle or dropship.*** She looks in the direction the TIEs went ***I only hope their reporting is as slack as their flying***
Naryen holds her right hand up shielding her eyes as she approaches the cart. She moves fast as she can manage without running and surely falling as she still feels a little light-headed from ride dirtside. She tries to take in the creature/cart and the passengers as much as she can, consious of them likely doing the same to her. ((OCC so here's a requisite & requested description))
*Skin pale like cream & messy black hair cut jaw length and matted with sweat and sand hangs and obscures her eyes which are a sharp light-ice blue and squinting hard against the harsh suns and through the fingers on her right had held up as a sun-sheild. Her shoulders are hunched and she holds her head down in an oddly submissive and tense pose so that her hair obscures her face. The grey-blue overalls she is wearing are clearly oversized and several pockets bulge noticably with their contents, with one ripped open. With a pack on her back and survival kits over left shoulder and her right seems to have someone clinging to it.
To one side and, holding her hand, a little human girl, somewhere between diapers and puberty, 2/3m in height. Light brown hair in curls around her face and shoulders, grey-green eyes and a simple orange dress draped in a dark brown vest too large for her used almost as an overcoat. She is huddling behind the woman, clearily scared, clutching 2 folded thermal blankets.*
((OCC I'm going to assume some here.))
Naryen is now close enough to hear Dexter say "Lets get a move on. We need to get moving again." She nods and walks around the side of the cart and heaves her packs over the side, with a grunt of effort she doesn't even try to supress, then lifts Lahela after them. Once Lahela steps in Naryen follows and quickly takes the thermal blankets and drapes one over Lahela and one over herself to sheild from the harsh sun. ***I wish I was ice surfing right now!***
Once Lahela and herself are situated Naryen pitches her voice in what she can recall of a feminine tone and says **"This is Lahela and you can call me Deidra. Thanks for the lift. Lucky you were along… Sorry about earlier, been a rough week."**

"Oh that is ok. My week was great up untill resently when I ran to the wrong side of one of the local crime bosses. But that is a story for another time. What about you? Your ship run into some problems have to get off the ship in a hurry?" Dexter cimbs up into the cart and gets the dewback moving again heading for next settlement.

## Re: Destiny

### **Rebaav** (2009-02-23 12:51:57)

Naryen blinks. ***Is there another use for escape pods?*** She opens her mouth, momentarily lost for something to say. ***Did he just imply that the local garrison would be looking for us or him?*** Naryen thought it wasnâ€™t possible but she feels even more uneasy about this Bothan than she did before.  ***Speaking casually about shooting people, upsetting local crime bosses & I think he just implied the Imperial detachment is looking for him! Either could get our descriptions from him and the way he freely advertisesâ€¦*** Naryen just starts to reach for the pouch with the reassuring bulge of her pistolâ€¦
Lahela leans forward and tugs on Naryens arm and whispers in that too loud not to be overhead tone children sometimes use that way: â€œDeidra, why is this hairy man talking about killing people and upsetting criminals? Is he going to kill us?â€ She starts shivering and her eyes start to shake in their sockets. Naryen realizes then, looking at Lahela strained eyes, that the poor child must not have been as unaware of the riot on the ship as she had hoped.
Naryen tries, awkwardly to reassure her, patting her shaking hand and talking in a low and, she hoped, reassuring tone. **â€Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s suffering from heat exhaustion.â€** Naryen thought immediately that it sounded insincere and with a smile reached to pull Chillzer from his pouchâ€¦ and finds instead the tattered remains of the pouch. Naryen quickly pads herself down and finds nothing else missing. With a puzzled look she recalls the clawing desperation of the other refugees on the Star of Cerea and one particular tug on her overallsâ€¦ ***Damn.*** She looks at Lahelas face and eyes as they seem to examine Dexters back now that heâ€™s back on the cart and not looking to convinced that heâ€™s suffering from heat exhaustion.
**â€Where are we heading and how long until we get there?â€** Naryen asks of Dexter in an attempt to distract from the rather disturbing flow of conversation. She rubs Lahelas hand some more and tries to position herself more between Dexter and Lahela and keeping low in the cart, covered from the sun. A set of survival gear would be great since I didn't find any water in the survival packs. **"…and do you have any water?"** Naryen looks at the other person on the cart acting as submissively as she can. ***I wonder if this other guy is as psycho as his driver?***

With some of your initial differences aside you continue on. Thankful for the transportation no matter how primitive and for the extra set of eyes watching out for dangers you make steady progress towards Mos Eisley. With an extra driver you are able to continue non-stop. On the cart itself the other man, Bandous sleeps for most of the trip. The man is injury, he looks as though he was beaten very badly.
Hours later the city of Mos Eisley comes into view. Looking down from a cliff side you see the port city sprawled across the desert floor. Buildings cobbled together from various part and scavenged materials to form a space port. Vehicles of all descriptions and technology level cram into the streets next to local pedestrians. Bandous stirs and slowly gets into a sitting position and looks around. â€œAh Mos Eisley space port you will want to watch yourselves in these parts. All sorts of scum call this place home.â€ The man points to the left of the city â€œHead in that direction my friends are just outside the city along the edge of town.â€
A short time later you pass by the space port and travel back into the desert. In the distance you see a small moisture farm with a space transport parked just outside. Even at this distance you see children running around outside, you also notice a Twi`lek woman and a small furry alien woman looking over the farm.
As you approach the farm the smaller woman turns to greet you. â€œAh welcome back Bandous I have your room ready.â€ Her smile changes when she sees the shape he is in. The Twi`lek has yet to turn and face you as of yet.

A sigh escapes the twi'lek as she watches the children for a few moments longer, she could hear the sounds of the cart of some kind, heard the woman...thing's words but she still wondered if they were really safe now. Finally deciding to turn she looks to the new comers. Even from far it was easy to see her lilac color, though one would have to be closer to see the pale blue of her eyes. Her clothing was tight and black with subtle low lights of purple, not revealing like the twi'lek's in slavery but rather modest and functional. Those that were familiar with Twi'lek would notice that her lekku were of a moderate sized. The headband she wears matches the rest of her clothing, black and twines around her lekku to the tips. Tar'ja crosses her arms and watches the people with vague interest, so long as they didn't try to touch her little one she had no quarrel with them.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Bestine**</span>
The crowds were out today. Chase wasnâ€™t sure if this was normal or not but he was thankful for it as the people kept Imperial troopers busy. He noticed the troopers stopping people for no apparent reason. *I need to get out of this place. The longer I stay here the more chances I take someone will recognize me.* 
Chase looked around not exactly sure of his next move. He needed transportation. Looking out over the people he saw the merchants peddling their wares, speeders, indigenous beasts for the conditions of the desert. He needed something but the hairs on the back of his neck told him something was out of place.
He took a few more steps and stopped to look around again. He knew he was standing out from the masses but the feeling would not go away. He shifted his pack to the left shoulder and used his left hand to hold the cloak somewhat closed. With his right hand he rested it on the grip of his blaster. The feeling was still there. *Something isnâ€™t right.* He thought.
Walking again looking ahead he noticed something. A robed figure stood at an entrance to an alleyway. Something about the figure seemed familiar. With a wave of its hand it beckoned him. Walking carefully toward the figure he looked around. No one else from what he could tell had seen the person. When he had gotten ten steps closer, he was now in the street among the people haggling for goods Chase caught a glimpse of the mans face. His heart skipped a beat.
â€œMaster.â€ He said out loud as he bumped into someone. An older human looked at him strangely with a hint of anger on his face. Chase looked at him and realized his mistake. â€œIâ€™m sorry excuse my clumsiness.â€ He continued on past the old human. *It is Garet. Why didnâ€™t I feel his presence before?*
He began to move faster and with more purpose. He attempted to do so with out attracting more attention. He was partially successful. Only a few people were helped aside by his hand as he moved. Several curses were uttered his way. His response was always the same. â€œExcuse me, sorry.â€
Arriving where he saw Master Garet he looked around hurriedly. Not seeing him.  *Dam where did he go?*  He thought to himself. He was anxious and frustrated that he lost him in the crowd. He took a breath to try and calm himself. Getting worked up was only going to get him caught. He continued on farther on through the growing crowds. If he didnâ€™t find him soon he never would. He looked down an alley way as he passed it. He saw the robe disappear around the corner. Quickly grabbing the side of the building as he almost walked past he backed up a sep and hurried down the alley at a quick jog.
Not wanting to loose sight again he rounded the corner and came to a sudden stop as he almost ran into someone heading towards him. â€œWoah.â€ He said. He looked at who was before him. A male Duros stood before him. He seemed to be in a hurry also. By the look on his face he was as shocked to see Chase there, as Chase was to see him.
Garet should have been here there was no way for him to be out of sight this quickly. Not with how fast Chase was running down the alley. Trying to catch his breath a bit, he looked around quickly as he felt his masters presence. He couldnâ€™t quite place it but it seemed to be one of calmness and safety. When he looked back at the Duros the feeling intensified a bit.
*Maybe he led me here to this Duros.*  He remembered Garet talking about Force Manifesting itself to those that could connect to it. *Maybe we were supposed to meet.* 
Still examining the Duros Chase got the feeling he was on the run and hiding. As a trio of troopers passed Chase saw the male lower his head. It was then Chase knew that the Force had brought them together.
â€œOver here. They may spot you.â€ He waved and spoke quietly, though loud enough for the Duros to hear him. He backed up around the corner he had just turned as it would they unable to be seen from the street from either direction.
**OOC:**
You see a human roughly 6â€™2â€. You can tell he is muscled even though the cloak he wears to cover himself covers him well. A good-sized duffel bad is over his left shoulder. Black pants and a tan shirt round out what he wears. Short brown hair and blue eyes that seem to suggest that they see more than most.
You also see the blaster at his side though his hand is not on it. In fact the hand that would be using it is the one he is using to waving you over.

OOC: Reworking a bit of my last post as I made a mistake. and accounting for Galens post in the Duty thread.
Chase backed away from the person he had just ran into. His hands still out before him between them. Looking up he saw a male Duros standing before him. Chase caught the fact that the aliens hand had fallen to his blaster that was at his side. Chase was now watchful. Even though he got the feeling of saftey from which may have been from the Force presence of his former master he wasn't about to be foolish.
Looking behind the Duros Chase saw the trio of troopers that began to pass by the opening to the alley way. It was then that the Duors spoke. "Excuse me. Easy there....um...you may not want to go that way. There's an Imperial patrol combing this sector."
Chase looked at him and nodded. "I know and there's a trio of troopers right down there at the opening." He looked to his right where he had just rounded the corner and waved his hand. "Come around the corner and keep the blaster handy. If they spot us we may need it. Lets hope that they don't." Chase backed up around the corner never turning his back on the alien. If the Duros was perceptive enough he caught that the Human in front of him was a trained combatant in that he never left an opening that would be exploited eaisly.
*If he's trying to avoid them maybe we can get out of karking place together. Master Garet you're still watching out for me. Thanks.* He thought to himself and smiled inwardly.

As the collision occurs, Kasga braces himself against the man with his left hand. His right hand claps to the butt of his Travotti service pistol. Once he recovers his balance, he steps back and lets him go. His stance relaxes, but his hand stays casually draped over his pistol.

The Duro you've met looks as most other Duro, with blue-green skin and red eyes. He has a puckered schrapnel scar high on the left side of his head. He is wearing a ship tech's jumpsuit, faded slate blue. His skin is looking a bit dry and his ship suit is dirty. Having not had a bath in several days, he smells a bit moldy. He's carrying a duffle bag that less rough than the rest of his clothes.
Kasga is still wary of this new human. He trails the human around the corner, his hand never leaving his pistol.
"You trying to recover something before the patrol finds it?"

The two of them moved from their current position to around the corner. As least from her they would not be seen. Chase watched the blue-green skinned alien warily. the same way that he is being watched. Looking him over again Chase can see that he is dirty. like he had been out in the desert for days. His drop to the hand that rests on the blaster and shakes his head.
**"You trying to recover something before the patrol finds it?"** The Duro asked.
Chase smiled and ran a hand over his short hair. His posture was a relaxed one. **"No not really. Just looking for a way out of here and over to Mos Eisley to take care of some business. I was hoping to cut through here but I see that is not an option."**
Chase looked around the corner and saw that the patrol had moved on. **"Either way it seems like neither one of us wants any…Imperial attention."**
His eyes go to the hand that rests on the blaster and shakes his head.

**Just outside Mos Eisley a moisture farm/ kindergarten.**
Naryen uses some clasps she found in the cart to secure the blankets into more like a hood & cloak arrangement covering her head and shoulders from the harsh suns. When itâ€™s her turn to direct the cart-lizard the setup is far more manageable and Lahela wastes no time scrambling to sit near her. As the trip progresses there is little opportunity to speak to the other person, just as well given his apparent injuries. ***Best that he rests undisturbed by the looks of him.*** In spite of that, occasionally he does seem to stir to check bearings but seems otherwise satisfied. ***Iâ€™d heard of raiders harassing travelers, either thatâ€™s an unsubstantiated rumor or these two know somethingâ€¦ patience*** Naryen spends some time trying to engage Lahela with what childhood stories she can recall. Lahela plays along and provides volumes with enthusiasm and leaves Naryen feeling calmed herself ***â€¦amazing!***
Naryen considers the sprawled port city below. ***Looks like a refugee campâ€¦ perfect.*** Bandous stirs and slowly gets into a sitting position and looks around. â€œAh Mos Eisley space port you will want to watch yourselves in these parts. All sorts of scum call this place home.â€ The man points to the left of the city â€œHead in that direction my friends are just outside the city along the edge of town.â€
**â€Who are your friends?â€** Naryen almost jumps at the opportunity to engage him given the somewhat subdued conversation during the trip.
â€œAn old friend of mine named Rasen, from way back, taught me everything I know. His wife runs a farm, thatâ€™s where weâ€™re headed. Theyâ€™re good people, I trust them & Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d arrange room and board for a short spellâ€ Naryens eyes widen and she shows a hopeful grin at this. With a grunt and flinch of pain, as he adjusts his posture, his demeanor hardens slightly when he continues. â€œJust please be on your best behavior, we donâ€™t want to draw too much attention to them.â€ Naryens face becomes pinched.
Naryen considers that and nods â€œYes, of course. Iâ€™ve heard stories about raiders and criminals, sounds like some of them are true.â€ ***â€¦and slavers.*** Naryen shivers visibly at the memories of Kashyyk.
After some travel past the space port and into the desert a moisture farm with a space transport parked just outside comes into view. Even at this distance children can be seen & heard running around outside. A Twi`lek woman and a small furry alien woman looking over the farm and Naryenâ€™s mood lightens at the sound of children playing. Lahela straightens up, brightening noticeably, and grips Naryens arm with barely contained energy. Naryen considers that if not for her presence the child would have bolted to the other children almost immediately. Naryen takes in the sound and energy of the children and her smile drops like it was never there ***â€¦and slavers.*** and recalls Bandousâ€™ warning â€œ â€¦we donâ€™t want to draw too much attention to them.â€
A small furry alien woman speaks up as they approach â€œAh welcome back Bandous I have your room ready.â€ Her smile changes when she sees the shape he is in.â€ The Twi`lek has yet to turn around, Naryen notes her basic characteristics and wishes she was more versed in non-humans. Naryen steps down from the cart and removes the survival kits then Lahela, who almost jumps into her arms as she watches the children playing. ***There were so few children on our shipâ€¦*** Lahela hides behind Naryens legs, though she still looks around her to the children. Naryen offers a hand to help Bandous from the cart.

Dexter hops down from the cart and helps his friend down. "Ya we ran a fowl of a gangster and his goons. He catch the worse fo it. I patched him up as best I could but I am no medic." As he helps him down he takes back the hold blaster and stashes it. "Go in and get yourself some rest. I will help the others." Dexter turns around leaving his friend in the care of the Twi'lek and helps the other to down. " So has there been interesting going on around here? We have ran into an Imperial fire fight and there was some Ties that buzzed us when we picked up these two." Dexter hopes that he is among friends and he doesn't have to worry about things to much.

Also for posting convention currently bolded in quotes are what Naryen/Deidra says and what is bolded and in Italics are her surface thoughts unspoken. Plain quotes are what others say to provide context for reponses & reactions.))
*A human female, seemingly slight in build, approximately 1Â½ m tall. Skin pale & messy black hair cut jaw length and matted with sweat and sand hangs obscuring her eyes which are a sharp light-ice blue and squinting hard against the harsh suns. A simple metal clasp has been used to secure a thermal blanket into a hood & cloak arrangement covering her head and shoulders from the harsh suns. Her shoulders are hunched and she holds her head down in an oddly submissive and tense pose so that her hair obscures her face. The oversized grey-blue overalls provide an androgynous appearance with some pockets bulging noticeably. At her feet are survival kits and a pack over left shoulder. Her right hand seems to have someone clinging to it huddled around her legs.
Huddled against her the adultsâ€™ legs and peering around nervously, a little human girl somewhere between diapers and puberty, less than 1m in height. Light brown hair in curls around her face and shoulders and a simple orange dress draped in a dark brown vest too large for her used almost as an overcoat. Nervous yet curious grey-green eyes set in a tense face, she is biting her lip and huddling behind the woman.*
With her left flank to the farm and offering her hand out to Bandous, Naryen is taken aback, again, at how free this Bothan is with broadcasting with his personal information and itinerary, even if it's embellished. She stares at him for a moment, long enough apparently for Bandous to miss her outstretched hand and clear offer of assistance. Just as she recovers, what Dexter said about not being a medic registers and she steps up with more enthusiasm than she would have otherwise intended.
**â€œIâ€™m a trained medic, Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™ve been so out of sorts lately. If there are proper medical supplies here please let me help!â€** ***Wow so much for maintaining a low profile! Naryen Fae superspie!*** An expression of awkward modesty flashes across her face to be replaced with a sterner determination as she looks to Bandous for a reply with a poorly suppressed expression of nervous anticipation. ***Perhaps if I offer some medical service I can get some food for me & Lahelaâ€¦ poor thing needs some other children so badly!***

Tar'ja looks over the new commers from a distance, she still wasn't too sure what to make of all this, though she does glance around quickly for her little one to make sure she was alright. Again her eyes trail back to the people, falling on the tall human with the girl attached to her, her daughter maybe? *hm…well…maybe she'd be more relaxed when she plays with the others, I'm sure my little one would love another playmate*
Trailing her eyes up the taller one, she watches the movements, strange that one, maybe they had a rough time on the sand..a brief look of blue and black set her mind back to the woman at the top of the landing in the port; the one that had been crying, but, that one...that had an imperial suit on.
Her eyes narrow, a spy or a fugitive? well she was going to find out. Striding to the human as grabs the other arm tightly "I'd like a word with you." she was trying to be polite..really..trying..that didn't mean her tone wasn't completely a demand.

**"Yeah…the Empire seems to be in a bit of an uproar and I don't need that kind of attention just now. Do you need a speeder? I know of several dealers in second hand tech. It won't be pretty or fast, but I could help make sure it'll get there."**

Chase watched the Duro relax a bit and removed his hand from his blaster, inside he relaxed as well. ***Well that's a step in the right direction Maybe together we can get out of here. The Imps might be looking looking more for individuals than a pair.***
The hot wind, common to Tatooine, blew through the alley disturbing whatever was unidentifiable along the alley wall. Judging by the smell it was probably alive recently.
"Yeah...the Empire seems to be in a bit of an uproar and I don't need that kind of attention just now. Do you need a speeder? I know of several dealers in second hand tech. It won't be pretty or fast, but I could help make sure it'll get there." The blue skinned Duro said.
Chase gave a half smile and nodded. **A speeder would be good. But credits are in short supply I'm afraid. I have some but it might not be enough."** He said as he set down his duffel bag that looked like it was packed tight by the sound it made hitting the hard surface of the ground.
He held out his right hand in greeting. In doing so the heavy blaster that was low on his hip became visible to his potential new traveling companion. "My name is Chase. Maybe together we can get out of here. I don't know Bestine well so if you know where to go lead on."

**Just outside Mos Eisley a moisture farm/ kindergarten.**
Naryen is still waiting for an answer to her offer when she abruptly feels a forceful grip on her arm as a voice to match speaks from her left flank, uncomfortably close. "I'd like a word with you." The tone is not that of a request and Naryens shocked expression is plain to Bandous and Dexter (since sheâ€™s facing them). She turns to see who has approached in such an overtly hostile manner... and sees a face she never expected to see. Eyes very close to her own in color, and a sternness she herself has often practiced in the mirror to appease so very many, set in a lilac face that expresses the same sentiment. Naryens eyes widen in shock and recognition and her body snaps rigid for a moment before she can correct. Lahela feels Naryens reaction and blurts out, in a near panic, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong!? Whoâ€™s that Deidra!?â€ and begins to tremble; now gripping Naryens legs with both arms.
She turns away from the Twiâ€™lek to look into Lahelas face, seeing the terror and feeling of helplessness plain on her face and feeling the tremors the little body is quaking with. In her mind she recalls the image on the Com-ops display back on Varlbrindal, seems like a lifetime ago. Many memories threaten to overwhelm her but one of this Twiâ€™lek, a still of a playback, stands out over the noise. The stern and determined expression on her face, just as now, and the look on the face of the child she was carrying out of a crowd of panicking people. The same look Naryen sees on Lahelas face. The effect on her is something else she never would have expected.
Something falls into place as Naryen looks into Lahelas eyes. Her body relaxes and she smiles at Lahela, **â€œItâ€™s ok.â€** gently she places her hand reassuringly on Lahelas head and rubs it as she remembers her mother doing to her. **â€œItâ€™s ok.â€** She turns back to the Twiâ€™lek with the same smile but with it no longer affecting her eyes. Naryen focuses on the image in her mind, of this Twiâ€™lek fighting to save the life of a child, trying to will her opinion of this person into reality. **â€I think this person is here for the same reason we are.â€** Naryen looks down at the hand on her arm then back up to the Twiâ€™leks eyes. Her expression isnâ€™t quite expressionless but close **â€Could I have my arm back please?â€** The tone is matter of fact though there is a sense of restrained hostility conveyed in the eyes.

Chase's offer of the handshake was taken and it seemd that both of them relaxed a bit more.
"I'm Kasga. I'd be interested in moving on to Mos Eisley. Sidatha's Swoop Repair might have what we need. I did a little work for him a while back. He's a nasty old Weequay, but I know his stock.

"I might be able to sell the rifle I picked up, but with the uproar, it might be hard to find a buyer."
Chase nodded. The swoop shop might be just the thing to get them out of here. he looked behind him down the alleyway that he had just came from. He thought he could still feel the presence of his Master, then again maybe not. Regardless the Force lead him here to Kasga. That counted for something.
**"Well maybe this Sidatha needs a good weapon to help him keep the peace around his shop. Maybe with that rifle and a few credits on my behalf we can get something in working order. I must tell you though I'm not looking to go into Mos Eisley itself initially. Just a small farm on its outskirts. There's a person I have to meet there?

Mistrust is in her eyes, though she follows the gaze to the girl; terror..oh she had hoped to not see that look so soon. Looking back to the human woman in time to meet her gaze again she takes notice of the expressions, the lack of emotion reaching to the eyes; truly that had to be imperial training..or..maybe simply the instinct to look braver to the little ones. **"Could I have my arm back please?"** Even with such a polite tone, she understood the meaning behind it and released the arm though slowly.
Answers were needed here and she looked to the little girl with a softened expression she had reserved for her little one "There's a few older ones playing nearby, my little one with you, about your age I think. I'm sure they'd love another playmate." She looks again to the woman "Don't you agree." *best have the children playing and unworried while we have a 'talk'* was the underlying meaning.

**Dosennaa`s Farm**
Bandous accepts the offer of help and slowly climbs down the cart. Letting out a groan that betrays his condition Bandous limps towards the little furry woman. â€œHello Doaennaa its been a while, have you heard from Rasen lately?â€ The woman hurries over to the burly human moving under his arm to take some of his weight.
â€œHe has not checked in for a while, must be out of communications range you know how those long haul runs can go.â€ Dosennaa begins to lead Bandous to the farm house door. â€œCould you all watch over the children for me? Our friend here needs to be patched up â€¦.. again.â€
Without waiting for an answer the two carefully make there way inside Bandous attempts to chuckle but stops in pain. Children continue to run around playing a game of chase, Lahela tries to watch both the fun and the awkward situation developing between the Twi`lek and human woman. Dosennaa comments as the pair enter the farm house and disappear into the stairway â€œItâ€™s not much but I will have a hearty meal for you all and a few bunks set up you are all more then welcome to stay for a little while.â€
Lahela looks up to Tar`ja then back to Deidra â€œI would like to play if I could.â€
A few of the children rush up and tap Lahela â€œYour it!â€ then run off. Torn on what to do, Lahela looks from Deidra to the other kids and then back. Unable to decline the challenge Lahela runs off in pursuit after the other kids, a melody of giggles and laughter fills the air. With the two women off to the side in a hushed conversation Dexter find himself in a babysitter roll watching over several children.
**Bestine**
With the initial shock of colliding into a complete stranger somewhat over both Kasga and Chase find a common purpose. With Kasga`s suggestion the pair head towards Sidatha`s swoop repair. Passing several more patrols of imperial troopers you watch as they stop and interrogate multiple individuals while giving you only mere glances.
Sidatha`s swoop repair is little more then a half collapsed building with various parts strewn over the entire compound. The area is surrounded by a durasteel fence assembled from various scraps. Inside piles of random parts tower over the remaining one story building which is half in ruins. From inside the compound you can see parts being thrown around and someone grumbling incoherent curses.
â€œSir we have customers.â€ A grey patchwork repaired droid greets you at the entrance â€œHello I am human cyborg relations unit CT-K5 and I am here at your service. What could I interest you in today?â€ The droid stands awaiting your response.
From the yard a loud growl erupts â€œI cut you I cut you. You looking for a fight come on! Come on!â€ more junk is thrown around which is followed by a torrid of cursing.
The droid turns his head to address his master â€œSir I said we have customers. No one wants to fight you.â€ Changing the subject the droid continues â€œSir have you found the hydro spanner yet?â€
Sidatha grumbles some more in his native tongue then goes back to throwing junk around.
Ct-K5 turns back to you two â€œHonestly I do not know how he is still in business. Oh wait thatâ€™s all me.â€ The droid steps to the side and motions for you to follow. Without missing a beat the droid continues his sales pitch. â€œWe have almost anything anyone could want or need, and if we do not have it we will get it for you.â€ Ct-K5 takes you through the establishments finest wares, which only means the items in the best condition. Noticing your interest in a tan soro-sub land speeder and a speeder bike in need or maintenance Ct-K5 continues â€œTransportation we have at reasonable pricing. This speeder is a one owner and currently at a reduced cost of only 2000 credits. This speeder bike has no guarantee but is a steal at only 200 credits.â€

Kasga looks the speeder bike over casually. From the outside, it looks in rough but serviceable shape. Kasga would feel lots more comfortable if he could look it over well before relying on the speeder to make it across the desert.
Looking around, Kasga asks, **"Hey Ct-K5, can I borrow some tools and open this up. I'd like to check the repulsors and the thrusters. I'd hate for this to burn out on me somewhere out in the wastes. If I find the hyrospanner, I'll let ya know."**

With in moments of meeting the two walking back down the alley that Chase had just traversed moments before. Breaking back out onto the street he was relieved that there were no troopers around. He made sure to keep his eyes open for any one following. Fortunately they were not stopped by any Imperial patrols on the way yo the shop.
On the way there Chase made an attempt to talk with Kasga. **"So you have here a while right? Anything ever happen on this planet?"**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The walk under the hot sun was fairly short to Sidatha's swoop repair, which was good. If it had been any longer Chase would have been let down when he saw the condition of the place. As it was, when he saw the place, he began to wonder if they would find anything that worked. The place was a dump.
**"Think we'll find anything in working order here?"** He said to Kasga looking around and spotting the flying assorted pieces of scrap metal. Incoherent curses could also be heard from the same direction.
Taking a few more steps they were intercepted by a droid that gave it's designation as Ct-K5 and offered its services. But before he could respond they were interrupted by the same voice as before but much louder. Pieces of junk still continued to fly.
Chase looked at Kasga and raised his eyebrows as the droid continued to get the persons attention in the junk pile. Finally with what may be a droids expression for exasperation it finally continues.
Ct-K5 shows them items which Chase would not inflict on his worse enemy with the exception of Zet the former first mate on the *Bloodhawk*.
***With any luck that one got what he deserved. If he didnâ€™t it wonâ€™t be long in coming till he pays for what he was trying to do.***
Chase was brought out of his thought by the question Kasga asked the droid. "Hey Ct-K5, can I borrow some tools and open this up. I'd like to check the repulsors and the thrusters. I'd hate for this to burn out on me somewhere out in the wastes. If I find the hyrospanner, I'll let ya know."
He looked at the Duro. **â€œReally?â€** He said with an incrediouls look. **It's in out budget but will it get us there?** He looked around at all the other junk that seemed to be older than he was. **"In one piece?"**
OOC: I wasn't able to get this up before Galen posted but there's some conversation in it for Kasga. I wanted to leave it in there.

Kasga answers Chase's questions in the trek across Bestine as well as he is able.
**"Not much really happens on this planet. I've been stuck on this rock for 4 months. My last contract forced me to take a crew slot buyout so they could carry some corp muckity-muck. The money was reasonable, but I haven't been able to get passage out. All the ships that show up haven't had spare berths or need crew slots filled. As my credits dwindled, I got desperate. I took a job that was risky to help out a friend. Now that something stirred up the Empire, my role in that job could get noticed if they look hard enough. I figure I'm better off laying low out of town for a while."**
Once they arrive a Sidatha's, Kasga replys,**"Maybe, maybe not. It's a good place to start."**
About the speeder, Kasga tries to look nonchalant,**"It looks battered, but it's what's under the housing that matters. That's why I want to check it. If it won't make the trip, we'll look elsewhere. "**
Following up on Chase's skeptic demeanor, Kasga asks, **"You know much about tech?"**

**The walk to the swoop shop**
Chase listened to Kasga as he talked about the past four months here on Tatooine. Seemed pretty typical up until he mentioned helping out a friend and getting under the Empires skin. And the fact they he played an active role in the incident was a bit surprising. ***Interesting turn of events. Not many are willing to go out on a limb against the Empire and Kasga here did it for a friend. Must be a good friend to stir up trouble with the Imps. The fact that I was lead to him wasn;t an accident. I know that now.***
Chase nodded as Kasga finished. **"Well then I say we get out of Bestine. Like you the less they notice me the better.** He finished with a smile.
**Bestine: Sidatha's shop**
Kasga followed up the question that was asked of him. "You know much about tech?"
Chase looked from him and back to the swoop. **"Do I know much about tech? Not so much. Fixing things has never been my strong point. Using them I'm good. But once it breaks I'm liable to break it more trying to fix it."**
Looking over to where the scrap metal and curses were both still flying. **"I hope some tools materialize."**

**Just outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaa`s Farm**
Bandous steps down from the cart, with Dexters help, then limps towards the little furry woman with a grunt. â€œHello Doaennaa its been a while, have you heard from Rasen lately?â€ The woman hurries over to the burly human moving under his arm to take some of his weight. Naryen observes intently, wishing she could be of more help, noting the grip on her arm.
â€œHe has not checked in for a while, must be out of communications range you know how those long haul runs can go.â€ Dosennaa begins to lead Bandous to the farm house door. â€œCould you all watch over the children for me? Our friend here needs to be patched up... again.â€ Dosennaa comments as the pair enter the farm house and disappear into the stairway â€œItâ€™s not much but I will have a hearty meal for you all and a few bunks set up you are all more then welcome to stay for a little while.â€ Naryen relaxes at that.
Children continue to run around playing a game of chase, Lahela tries to watch both the fun and the awkward situation developing between the Twi`lek and Naryen. She glances over her shoulder at the Twi'leks face as she observes Lahela and released her grip with a softer expression directed at Lahela. "There's a few older ones playing nearby, my little one with you, about your age I think. I'm sure they'd love another playmate." Naryen turns at that and beams a smile down at the child still gripping her legs in fear and tries to relax so she doesn't get further upset. Naryen, while looking at Lahelas face, nods her head in the direction of the children playing as she hears the Twi'lek say "Don't you agree." it wasn't in the tone of a question.
Lahela looks up to the Twi'lek then back to Deidra â€œI would like to play if I could.â€ ***The poor child doesn't want to leave me alone with this person.*** Naryen smiles & opens her mouth to try to reasure her again, and suggest she goes and play, when a few of the children rush up and tap Lahela â€œYour it!â€ then run off. Lahela looks from Deidra to the other kids and then back then runs off in pursuit after the other kids. Naryen watches the change on her face and the energy in her step, and turns to watch, now facing the farm with the Twi'lek to her left.
A melody of giggles and laughter fills the air. Naryens eyes widen, a full smile fights its way onto her face and her eyes wet with tears. She recalls trips, when she was very young, with her parents to the northern glacial fields. Valhalan wind surfing, kites and skates, the squeals of children all around her, including her own then. The smell of the chilled air, the avians calling out from above. Innocence. The play of the children reaches a crescendo and her mind twists the sound/memory into the scream of young wookies and humans being shot to death staccatoed but the sound of Imperial rifle shots.
***Screaming.***
The image of her parents corpses jumps to the foreground of her mind like a predator leaping on it's prey. Naryens eyes squeeze shut and a grunt escapes her. Her body follows suit, like someone that has just been sucker punched in the gut, bending forward slightly. She opens her eyes and and pushes a calming breath through her mouth so she can bring the fake smile back. Looking up at the children she's thankful that Lahela is, now, blissfully unaware. With another breath, and somewhat restored resolve, she turns slightly to look into the Twi'leks eyes and says with all the conviction she can muster. ***The death of innocence. Trust, Naryen! Trust this person with what it seems she can be trusted with!***
**"Yes, I do agree."** Naryen looks to the children and then casts a far-away look. **"So very much has been lost"** The expression seems to encompass so much. She closes her eyes again and listens to the sound of the children playing and takes a slow cleansing breath, with a forced smile on her face, then opens her eyes to watch the children and Dexter. **"Best not to lose anything else. I'm called Deidra"**

"Deidra my lekku." Naryen, still facing the farm, scowls slightly at this. ***That's odd, I wasn't lying. Lahela has been calling me Deidra for a few days now.*** "cut the bantha droppings, I saw you at the imperial base, in an imperial uniform." The scowl is replaced by a momentary expression of suprise to then quickly be replaced by, of all things a slight smile. ***Well I am having a bad week aren't I?*** She opens her mouth to respond but the Twi'lek continues. Naryen slowly pull sback her "hood" and straights out her hair and posture in a single smooth move and a calming breath and continues to listen to the Twi'lek.
"What're you doing here? bringing the empire to this small area?" ***They could have watched the escape pod from orbit the whole way down, true. And from there the cart trip to here."*** The smile is gone, wiped from her face. She imagines troopers ransacking the farm and the childrens limp bodies spasming with weapon impacts. "going to turn that girl over to them so they can murder her like the did my little one's real mother?" Her own mothers face, with vacant eyes staring pleadingly at her fills her mind. "let them kill all the children?"
Naryen starts to look panicked and talks to herself, though the Twi'lek would overhere easily enough **"For all I know they could have tracked us from orbit and some local TIEs may have reported our escape pod.** She raises her voice to conversation level **We need to tell Dosennaa and see what she thinks!"** Naryen starts towards the Farm then stops then turns slightly towards the Twi'lek with a determined and fierce look in her eyes. **"And as far as anyone here is concerned my name is Deidra. Lahela is quite happy to call me that and that's how it will stay as much for her protection as mine. We can discuss that later, in private, if you insist and you can tell me what you want me to call you then."** She starts walking towards the farm at a determined pace leaving the Twi'lek behind if need be.

Warning the others? *hmph…maybe there's more to this imperial then just a uniform.* Following after she ponders the name, and the the relationship between the human and the child. She hadn't seen a child with her when she had passed with Lyn'aris, though the girl could have been waiting in the other room...maybe she took pity on the girl when she killed her parents. Tar'ja frowns and shakes her head, she needed to start trying to be more positive about this whole thing. The people seemed nice, Lyn'aris was having fun...maybe...the imperial female wouldn't be too bad. Nodding to herself she walk to catch up with the female human. "A warning would be good."

Dexter watches his friend be helped into the house and the childern playing he has been left on his own outside in the yard. He takes the dewback and cart to an area where he ties it up to make sure nothing happens to it. *"Well I hope this is where I can find a ride out of here. Cause i would hate to have to shot my way out of another situation."* Looking around at the farm it looks like any other farm in the area, childern playing driods working the same everywhere on this forsaken dust ball of a planet.
He makes his way over to some shade and watches the childern play. He remebers a time when that was all he cared about. Those times are now gone, he has other things to do and things to keep in order. He pulls his datapad out of his pocket and sees if there is any info that has been downloaded in the last 24 hours or so. *" Ah the great spynet.

As Chase move to enter the compound searching for the missing tool Ct-K5 moves to block his path. â€œSorry sir but I must advise against this course of action. Sidatha is in one of his moods I would recommend against going back there.â€ The droid pauses in your path blocking the door way. It looks around as if taking such an action was against its primary programming.
â€œWho wants to fight? I take you all on!â€ The Weequay continues his barrage of curses and rampaging search.
The droid continues â€œI am sorry sir it is for your own safety.â€ At kasga`s question to look over the vehicles Ct-K5 changes the subject â€œI am sorry kasga you know the rules as is where is. But you will find no better deal.â€ Looking over the two vehicles you see that the speeder is banged up but in fair condition. It is missing a few panels but overall a good deal, most likely they would be asking more for the speeder except that SuroSuub K-34 land speeders are not in high demand since several newer models came on the market. The bike is a different story. The repulse housing is shot the coil assembly worn and the stabilizer intermittent to say the least. The bike should hold for a few more runs if itâ€™s not pushed to hard, but its in rough shape and the price shows.
While you look over the vehicles another buyer walks in scanning the area for spare parts and hidden deals. Sidatha begins his usual greeting â€œI cut you, I cut you! You looking for a fight? Come on come on!â€
This is followed by Ct-K5`s diplomatic interjection â€œHere we go again. Excuse me sir could I assist you with locating some premium quality goods? I am Ct-K5 human cyborg relations and I am at your service.â€ The droid greets the new customer a heavy set human with a blue labor droid hauling his recently acquired shopped goods. Ct-K5 watches both the new comer and your party of two while you look around.
**Just outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaa's Farm**
Dexter watches as the children play so many children so care free. They laugh and giggle as they continue their game of tag. Despite the continuous squealing their innocents seems to melt the recent events away. Itâ€™s a wonder that Dosennaa has created such a worthy cause on such an unruly planet.
Naryen and Tar`ja enter the farm house after their short discussion. Inside the walls are bare lighting is minimal and luxuries non-existent. Following the white stone stair case down you find Dosennaa standing over Bandous in a side room. Bandous looks unconscious but his breathing appears much stronger now. Dosennaa has several new bandages on the man now and is cleaning up some of the remaining mess.
Donsennaa looks back to the two of you as you enter and quietly remarks â€œI thought I asked you to watch over the children.â€ Noticing that only two of you came down the short furry woman looks back to Bandous and continues her work. â€œYour friend better have eyes in the back of his head.â€

**Bestine Swoop Shop**
Chase looked at Kasga. **"I'll go take a look and see if I can find the tool kit."** He turned around and began to walk and almost stepped into the droid. Chase looked at the droid as it had moved to block his entry to the compound. He took a step back as the droid paused and spoke.
â€œSorry sir but I must advise against this course of action. Sidatha is in one of his moods I would recommend against going back there.â€ As if to emphasize the droids words Sidatha lets loose with a string words as if he was looking for a fight. â€œI am sorry sir it is for your own safety.â€ Chase nodded and backed up a step to stand next to the swoop that looked like it was in bad shape.
He looked around and then up into the shy as he shielded his eyes from the binary suns that baked Tatooine day after day. ***It's going to be a long time getting there if we can't find something cheaper.*** He thought as his gaze went back to the two vehicles that were offered. Two thousand was too much that would wipe him out of credits. Two hundred for the swoop that might not get them where they want to go. Ct-K5 continues on with Kasga saying that he knows the rules.
As they continued to look at the two options another buyer walked in and the triad of fight demands again came from the junk yard. Chase shook his head as the droid left them to greet the new customer.
**"I don't know Kasga our options aren't the best. The speeder is too much and the swoop might get us killed. What's your take on the bike. Will it get us to where we're we want to go?"** 
Chase happened a glance at the newcomer. A heavy set human with it labor droid with goods in tow.

Chase walks back over to Kasga near the speeder bike. Kasga just shakes his head as he looks over the bike.
Kasga speaks quietly looking at the speeder, **"It's not on it's last legs yet, but it's close. I don't know how long it will hold out. It'll probably make it there, but if we run into trouble, we couldn't really run away. The bike won't take it. We could also end up stranded out there with no parts or tools. I agree with Ct-K5's assessment. It would be hard to find one like this that's not just being sold for scrap. "**
After thinking a moment, Kasga murmers, **"I'd risk it if I were alone. I'd have to sell some stuff to get it, but I'd be willing. If you have the creds, it'll have to be your choice whether or not to risk them."**

**Just outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaa`s Farm**
Naryen barely notices the minimalism of the farm, not so disimilar to Imperial interiors, as she walks down the stairs, or the proficiency with which Dosennaa tends to Bandous. Donsennaa looks back and quietly remarks â€œI thought I asked you to watch over the children.â€ Then the short furry woman looks back to Bandous and continues her work. â€œYour friend better have eyes in the back of his head.â€
Naryen speaks immediately in a hurried almost distraught tone. **â€Iâ€™m sorry â€¦ Donsennaa but I really needed to speak with you about something.â€** Nervously she barrels on **â€œLahela and I came down in an escape pod. The impact put up a lot of smoke and atmospheric interference that Iâ€™m sure was recorded on the sensor logs of a local TIE element that was flying a patrol nearby.â€** Naryen looks down for a moment, fiddling with her hands, as she struggled with the next part ***By the four winds I feel like a kid trying to talk with my Tutors!***
She stops, dropping her arms to her sides and looks up with her eyes closes and a held deep breath. She opens her eyes and fixes Donsennaa with a determined expression. With much more confidence she begins **â€œWe were in orbit aboard a transport that was fired upon by Imperials and we barely escaped with our lives. Our descent was preprogrammed but the pod took damage and were thrown off our approach. They may be looking for us even now! I donâ€™t want them to come hereâ€¦â€** Her voice strains near the end as images from Kashyyk and Varlbrindal start to force themselves forward in her mind. She continues to look at Donsennaa with now a worried and haggard expression on her face and in her eyes. ***I donâ€™t want to be responsible for any more innocent deaths.***

Kasga answered his question. "I'd risk it if I were alone. I'd have to sell some stuff to get it, but I'd be willing. If you have the creds, it'll have to be your choice whether or not to risk them."
He looked back at the swoop and then back to Ct-K5 who was dealing with the heavy set Human. Still looking at the droid he nodded. **"Well it's only 200 credits."** He said loud enough for the Duro to hear. **"That I can afford. Besides I don't plan on staying on this planet any longer than I have to. As long as it gets me to my destination I'm good. If you want to keep it after that fine by me as I would not be able to fix it anyways."**
He looked around. **"Besides, business looks slow. Maybe we can cut a deal of some sort?"**
Chase just wanted to get to Dosennaa, Rasen's wife even though he dreaded what he had to tell her. It had probably been a long time since he last checked in with her. Maybe she was worried. She deserved to know how and why he died.

**Just outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaa's Farm**
Dosennaa finishes with Bandous then tidyâ€™s up after herself while she listens to Derdra`s story. â€œI am sorry to hear of you plight and I wish I could say youâ€™re the first to tell it.â€ Dosennaa`s head hangs low in thought for a moment before she continues â€œ The empire would destroy all we hold dear if no one opposed them. Every child here has been directly affected by this evil war. I thank you for your honesty many would not be so kind.â€
Finished cleaning up the medical supplies Dosennaa walks for the door stopping just inside the archway. â€œStay the night I will have work for you all in the morn. Oh and make yourselves useful and watch over the children while I make todayâ€™s meal.â€ With a smile she leaves you can hear her whistling as she moves down the stairs into another section of the compound.
Outside both Lahelas and Lyn`aris are deep into a continuing game of tag with no clear victor. Dexter does his best to keep watch over the children but is being distracted as several more children have decided the quite Bothan makes for a wonderful jungle gym.
**Bestine**
The heavy set merchant concludes his transaction stowing a few choice items for his droid to carry. The man like so many others keeps his cloak held tightly around himself, his droid if it can does not speak one word merely standing awaiting command. All around locals continue to buy and sell the market street is in full pace for the days business. Patrols of troopers continue but even they seem to fade into the busy background.
Ct-K5 concludes the transaction for the speeder bike and even volunteers to lower the price to 150 credits, stating word of mouth through good deals carries far. Kasga has seen Ct-K5 give these kinds of deals before when Sidatha was in his full glory. The droid accepts the exchange of credits â€œThank you for doing business with Sidatha`s and please come again.â€
With everything you own on your possession and little reason to stick around Bestine any longer you set off on the speeder bike. The bike itself is old the manufacturer unknown, if it still even exists. Unlike other similar bikes its controls are rudimentary in design. Kasga offers to drive and after some discomfort with the single seated bike you are on your way into the desert.
Kasga takes a moderate pace to ease the bikes engines and reach Mos Eisley before dark. The trip is uneventful and by the time the port city comes into view darkness has begun to set. The bike itself is starting to trail dark smoke which dissipates about fifty meters behind. Not sure how much longer the bike will hold out you head towards the safe house coordinates.
Interesting Kasga has changed direction without conversation and it just happens to be in the same direction as Dosennaa`s farm house. By the time you reach the small farm house darkness has set in and only the lights of the moisture vaperators guild you in. The bikes engines stall as you land you are sure it will need maintenance before another trip.
 **Just outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaa's Farm**
The nights meal is refreshing you are seated together within rows of other benches and tables. Dosennaa manages to avoid a series of food fights and after dinner the children all help with the clean up. Dosennaa has shown you to a common room with a few bead spread scattered around the floor. â€œYou can sleep here for the night. Do not worry about the children they are tiered from the days play.â€ Dosennaa turns to leave â€œyou are an unlikely bunch to say the least but I have a feeling about you guys.â€
The womanâ€™s furry ears perk back as she pauses to listen. â€œWe have visitors. Come meet them with me.â€ Unsure you all listen as well and slowly you hear the low roar of a speeder. You make your way up the stairs behind Dosennaa who opens a slot on the door and looks out. â€œTravelers must be having problems with their speeder bike. Here take a look.â€ One by one you look through the slot. Outside at the edge of the farms light you see two individuals a human and a Duro`s standing looking around. Beside them an older model speeder bike rests on the ground smoke rising from the bikes engine. Dosennaa yells out the small rectangular slot â€œWho goes there at this hour?â€

**Bestine**
The twin suns were beginning to have an effect on him. Never before had he experienced heat like this. It seemed that his cloak was both a blessing and a curse. It protected him from the sun but also made him warmer. The merchant took the wares he purchased and moved on with his droid following in tow. Watching the two go Chase looks out onto the street. It was busy out there. He began to wonder if today was different than most. It may explain the mass of people that were out. Either way it was good as the more people that were out the more cover they would have.
He attention was brought back to Kasga and Ct-K5. The droid had lowered the price to 150 credits. Chase nodded and they took the deal. **â€Iâ€™ll pay for it.â€** He reached into his bag into the box that held the 2,000 credits that he got as his shard from the *Bloodhawk.* Pulling out his hand he handed the amount sue to the droid. **â€there that should cover us. Iâ€™ll make sure to mention the good deal we received from you.â€**
He cinched up his bag and looked to Kasga. **â€No sense in sticking around.â€**
Before long they were on their way to Mos Eisley. The bike wasnâ€™t comfortable. He wasnâ€™t sure that it would be comfortable for one rider much less two but they were making decent time to Mos Eisley.
**Outside Dosennaa's farm**
With smoke trailing a great distance behind them Kasga changes direction towards the Dosennaaâ€™s fame. **â€Interesting Kasga, This is the way I need to go also. Very interesting.â€** A few moment s later they say the lights of the farm up ahead. Guided by the lights of the vaperaters they set down maybe fifty feet from the dwelling. As if in defeat the engine on the swoop stalls as they set down, it had finally had enough.
Chase dismounted from the bike and grabbed his bag as he stepped away to let Kasga get off. **â€Well for 150 credits it did its job. If you hadnâ€™t babied her we might not have made it.â€**  He looked around. **â€Itâ€™s still amazing that we were both coming here. Maybe it speaks of something?â€**
He looked to the farmhouse as some people were coming out of the door. ***Itâ€™s the Force. It lead me to Kasga and it led us here. Thereâ€™s a meaning behind this. Master Garet would not have lead me this way if it wasnâ€™t for some greater reason.*** 
â€œWho goes there at this hour?â€ A small figure among several calls out to them. The sound of its voice reminds him slightly of Rasen. He sighed and took a few steps forward to come into the light a bit more.
**â€Hello, my name is Chase. I was a crew member on the *Bloodhawk* and a friend of Rasen. I am looking for his wife Dosennaa. Am I at the right place?â€** He said openly and honestly. He was positive that he was at the right place but he has to make sure.

Once Chase purchases the bike, Kasga is eager to go. His travelling companion has much the same thought.
The journey is hot and dusty, but every klick away from Bestine is another klick away from the Empire.
Kasga veers off toward the coordinates he'd received from the burst broadcast. Chase didn't seem concerned about the change of direction. Kasga wonders how he knew of this safehouse. Recalling the compromised mission, Kasga worries silently that he might be delivering another Imperial agent to the Rebellion cell on Tantooine. His own identity compromised, Kasga recognizes that he has little choice. Hopefully, the Rebellion has ways of dealing with infiltrators.
As they arrive near the coordinates, the engine coil starts overheating and smoke starts trailing them. Not wanting to lose speed this close to the end, Kasga milks the engines for all it's got. It's no surprise to him when engine burns out all together as they come into the moisture evaporator field. Killing the engines, Kasga glides the speeder bike until it stops about 50 feet from farmhouse.
Chase dismounted from the bike and grabbed his bag as he stepped away to let Kasga get off. **"Well for 150 credits it did its job. If you hadnâ€™t babied her we might not have made it."** He looked around. **"Itâ€™s still amazing that we were both coming here. Maybe it speaks of something?"**
Kasga kills the repulsors and settles the bike into the sand. Stepping off, he responds, **"I knew that engine coil was trouble. Luckily it was mostly dark when it overheated. Maybe we didn't get noticed coming in."** Also looking around at the sparse farm, Kasga continues, **"Yeah, it means too many people know of this place."**
Kasga startles at Dosennaa's yell. He looks around and wearily focuses on the farmhouse door.
He walks slowly forward with Chase, his hands held out away from his sides in a passive stance.
**"Hello, my name is Chase. I was a crew member on the Bloodhawk and a friend of Rasen. I am looking for his wife Dosennaa. Am I at the right place?"** He said openly and honestly. He was positive that he was at the right place but he has to make sure.
After Chase is done, Kasga speaks slowly,**"I'm Kasga Harato. I'm Kirn's brother."**

**Just outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaa&#39;s Farm.**
â€œI am sorry to hear of you plight and I wish I could say youâ€™re the first to tell it.â€ Dosennaa`s head hangs low in thought for a moment before she continues. Naryen relaxes, somewhat, at this news. ***If others have come under the same circumstances then perhaps we are safe. For now.*** â€œThe Empire would destroy all we hold dear if no one opposed them.â€ ***For some of us it already has â€¦ â€œitâ€?…*** â€œEvery child here has been directly affected by this evil war." Some part of Naryens mind is not surprised at that at all. Naryen makes a note to have a conversation with that part of herself later to see what other information has been withheld. "I thank you for your honesty many would not be so kind." Naryen is at a loss for words and simply nods and wears an expression of weary thanks on her face as she doesn't trust her own voice.
Dosennaa cleans up from her work on Bandous then walks for the door stopping just inside the archway. â€œStay the night I will have work for you all in the morn. Oh and make yourselves useful and watch over the children while I make todayâ€™s meal.â€ With a smile she leaves you can hear her whistling as she moves down the stairs into another section of the compound. Naryen feels oddly at ease now and wears the expression plainly. Work to earn her keep and a safe place to leave Lahela. She walks outside and watches the children from a distance. Lahela waves at her once and seems content to play with the children climbing on Dexter. Occasionally one would roll off with a gleeful squeal. Naryen looks close to tears as she watchesâ€™, not wanting to miss a moment of this display of innocent abandon.
Later she enjoys the first home cooked meal she's had since likely her childhood, though those memories hurt to recall now. Watching the motherly efforts of the little woman and the free energy that Lahela revels in, Naryen is reminded again of all that she has lost and looks the part. During the meal she more than once hangs her head and closes he eyes, listening to the room, and trying not to cry. More than once she doesn't succeed and wipes a tear from her face. ***Iâ€™m not used to feeling safe like this!*** After the children have helped clean up Dosennaa shows the adults to a common room with some beds. ***What she said was true, this looks to be a place that's been well used.*** â€œYou can sleep here for the night. Do not worry about the children they are tired from the days play.â€ Dosennaa turns to leave â€œyou are an unlikely bunch to say the least but I have a feeling about you guys.â€
Dosennaa ears perk back and she pauses for a moment, listening, before she addresses the room. â€œWe have visitors." Naryen almost jumps out of her skin and starts to reach to the belt pouch where she's stashed her pistol, but stops herself, watching Dosennaa and taking her lead. "Come meet them with me.â€ She walks up the stairs. Naryen follows behind and watching intently. Dosennaa opens a slot on the door and looks out. â€œTravelers must be having problems with their speeder bike. Here take a look.â€ Naryen waits her turn then looks through the slot in the door to outside. Outside at the edge of the farms light she sees two individuals a human and a Duro`s standing looking around. Beside them an older model speeder bike rests on the ground smoke rising from the bikes engine. Dosennaa yells out the small rectangular slot â€œWho goes there at this hour?â€
Two voices respond from outside "Hello, my name is Chase. I was a crew member on the Bloodhawk and a friend of Rasen. I am looking for his wife Dosennaa. Am I at the right place?" and "I'm Kasga Harato. I'm Kirn's brother." Naryen watches Dosennaa intently for her response. ***Friends or foes?***

Tar'ja was quiet as the other woman spoke and told of her flight from the ship, something she was going to keep in mind to ask about on a later basis. Following after the woman to the door and watching the children play; she had to admit, it was truly an amusing sight to watch the children play on the Bothan as though he was their own personal toy. She cracks a smile watching the children a soft laugh escaping her; this was rather nice, for once not wondering where the meal was going to come from and if the bed was going to be a floor or if it would be safe to sleep.
At dinner, the twi'lek watches her charge, making sure she was alright amongest the other children while she at slowly. the food was good but, the setting of so many people was fairly familier and foriegn at the same time. The last time she had eatten with those that felt like family was with...she closes her eyes and banishes the thought from her mind, this was different. She was going to make sure this would be different.
The Beds were a welcome sight, no floors tonight but an actual bed, and one for Lyn'aris no doubt. She'd sneak up later to check on the girl before attempting to find sleep *'hm…should move a bed to the wall corner..'* she didn't like not being near a wall when sleeping, she felt too open. At Dosennaa's words the twi'lek follows taking a turn to look to those that arrived. Were they friends or foes? she wasn't about to let anyone get to her Lyn without a fight. Looking to the woman for her reaction to the words of the new people.

Then he notices the others come out of the house to wittness him and the childern at play. Aas they are called inside for dinner he sits down with the others and enjoys the meal. Not what he has become acustom to sence he started his scam awhile back but food is food.
As they follow there hostess to a room with some beds. "Well I could use good nights sleep. If you don't mind i look forward to seeing you all in the morning." He walks over to one of the beds and sets down and removes his gun belt and coat. "Night all." He lays down and falls asleep.

At the mention of Rasen Dosennaa franticly struggles with the locks trying to open the door. From the outside your hear a series of metallic clicks. â€œRasen! How do you know him? Where is my husband?â€ The Bimm woman begins before the door is even opened. Throwing the door open she rushes outside.
â€œAnswer me!â€ Before you a short alien covered in brown fur approaches you. She looks into Chases eyes the person who had mentioned her husband by name, the woman stops then as if seeing it in the mans eyes falls to her knees. â€œNo no no no no. Not my â€¦â€ Sobbing Dosennaa sits half way between the door and the new comers crying on her knees.
Behind her a human female dressed in a janitors uniform and a female Twi`lek stand inside the door way watching the scene. Inside the farm house darkness conceals the interior from view.

Tar'ja moves forward as the woman falls to her knees, taking note of the other woman going for her gun decides she had best try to comfort the woman...not that she had good experience but hell it was worth a shot. Even in the dark her lilac skin is still seen somewhat well; the parts that appear darker are the black clothes she wears; tight to her form with hints of purple along them.
In the fading light her lekku can be seen as average in build, a headband matching her clothes color and low-lights of purple wrap around her lekku all the way to the tips; around her neck is a choker with broken chains, an odd choice in jewelry though it might be a fashion statement.
Her blaster is visible though for the moment she doesn't move to draw it. She kneels down beside the woman though watches the males carefully, if they knew her husband then they were either friends of his or they were the ones that killed him. Pale blue eyes narrow slightly to them "how do you know her husband."

The change in Dosennaas demeanor is all she needed. Up to this moment this little furry womans comfort with things as they are allowed Naryen some odd feeling of security in this unfamiliar environment. Her distraught and loss of composure tell her that things have changed and not for the better. ***Back into the fray. Good thing I hadn't even put the pack down, may be leaving soon.***
Her face smooths over and her eyes harden. She glances at the Twi'lek face, hoping for a moment to convey some kind of gameplan, and slowly draws her weapon and holds in at her side and takes a couple of steps backwards down the stairs. Watching the little Bim woman struggling with this implied news, while still positioned to observe, so that the stairway provides some cover. She flashes a hand signal down the stairs to anyone behind her, open palm swept back, as she takes the steps down. ***Get back!***
The pain in Dosennaa voice twists at Naryens gut, though her outward appearance betrays none of it. She looks out from the stairwell, poised and hoping not to have to act.
((OCC: For those that managed a good look, before she ducked amost out of sight, here's the description.))
*A human female, seemingly slight in build, approximately 1Â½ m tall. Skin pale, though slight flushed with what seems to be the light pink of a fresh sun-burn & black hair cut jaw length longer in the front obscuring her eyes which are a sharp pale blue eyes expressing a look of calm intensity.
A simple metal clasp has been used to secure a thermal blanket into a hood & cloak arrangement covering her head and shoulders from the harsh suns. The oversized grey-blue overalls provide an androgynous appearance with some pockets bulging noticeably.*

Not seconds after he mentioned Rasenâ€™s name he heard the locks being fumbled with from behind the door. â€œRasen! How do you know him? Where is my husband?â€ He heard the voice with panic in its tones as the door was thrown open. He saw the short furry Bimm as she came towards him. â€œAnswer me!â€ She pleaded.
Chase watched her as she ran. He tried to keep the news he was about to deliver to her out of his eyes but he couldnâ€™t. He wasnâ€™t even sure if he could, or should. As if reading his thoughts Dosennaa falls to her knees and begins sobbing. Chase couldnâ€™t put into words how he was feeling. The loss of his friendship and the pain etched on her face was almost too much. â€œNo no no no no. Not my â€¦â€ He sighed and hung his head. Those few words would stay with him forever.
He walked closer to Dosennaa with his pack over his right shoulder. Now that he was closer and more into the light of the farmhouse those inside and out could see him better. Walking towards them was a tall human with short blond hair. Though the cloak covers him well he looks like he is no stranger to hard work. If one was to look harder they would notice a bulge in the cloak where one would normally carry a blaster at ones right side. Tan cargo pants and a white shirt, which has a few buttons undone, make up the Humans clothing under the cloak. All of the garments look dirty and dusty a tribute to spending a bit of time here on Tatooine.
As he advanced an attractive Twiâ€™lek woman also came out and knelt down beside the little Bimm. Chase notices the blaster that is within easy reach and takes notice. He looked her in the eyes his own grief was evident as she spoke. "How do you know her husband?"
Chase stopped a hald-dozen feet from the two women and set his bag down. **â€A fair question. One that does not have a short answer.â€** He said as he stood there. He made sure to keep his hand away from his blaster.
***This is harder than I thought it was going to be.*** He thought as he tried to find the right words to say. That is if there was any. The cool Tatooine night breeze blew and it made his cloak billow out a bit.
**â€As I said I was a crew member on the *Bloodhawk* and Rasenâ€™s friend. A few weeks back that all changed when the cargo we were carrying to a buyer turned out to be slaves. Most of us were stunned to believe that the Captain and the First mate would take such a job. The contents of the cargo was unknown to the rest of the crew.â€** 
He knelt down to be on a better level with the little Bimm. For his words were really for her.
**â€Rasen was the only one who did anything at first. He went back into the ship as the Trandoshans, the buyers, told us to continue. I began to question the Captain who said he had no choice. But before anything else could be done Rasen came out of the ships hold with a blaster and shot one of the Trandos.â€**  He looked at Dosennaa. She was listening. That was all he could ask for.
**â€A fight broke out. Rasen was shot and fell. The Captain told us to fight back as the First mate attacked. Apparently he had made a deal with them and he was looking to get take the ship. The crew managed to get the what cargo that had been offloaded back onto the ship as the Captain, myself and a few others held off the first mate and the Slavers.â€** He stopped for a moment and continued.
**â€We managed to get away. Rasenâ€™s last words were of you.â€**  He looked right at Dosennaa. **â€He told me to come here to Tatooine, to find you. To give you something as it would take care of â€œthemâ€â€.** He pulled his bag to him slowly. And carefully opened it up. On top was the small box that was entrusted to him by his friend. He pulled it out and held it out to her.
**â€I never looked inside of it. I promised him that I would deliver it to you in person. Here it is.â€** A genuine look of sadness washed over him. It had taken weeks for him to finally get here. Now it was finally over. His promise fulfilled.
**â€Iâ€™m so sorry we were not able to save him. He was a good friend to me.â€**

Kasga stands listening to the woman's crying, scanning the horizon. In spite of himself, he thinks of his bright shining brother and tears well up in his eyes. At least the woman will have peace, it might be years before he knew his brother's fate, for good or ill.
OOC
Kasga is a Duro that looks as most other Duro, with blue-green skin and red eyes. He has a puckered schrapnel scar high on the left side of his head. He is wearing a ship tech's jumpsuit, faded slate blue. His skin is looking a bit dry and his ship suit is dirty. Having not had a bath in several days, he smells a bit moldy. He's carrying a duffle bag that less rough than the rest of his clothes.

Tar'ja listens intently, wrapping a tenative comforting arm around the woman, was this how it was done? Best try not to look like she didn't know what she was doing. The twi'lek watches the males movements for sign of intention to hurt the woman, the careful placement to his hands away from his blaster didn't go unnoticed to her eyes; it was a good sign, a careful geasture; *this one doesn't mean harm…* she thinks before looking to the other male briefly *that one….we'll have to see*.
Her gaze returns to the human, watching the slow movements of bringing the bag forward, her hand twitching to her blaster before stilling, again it twitches when it's opened but stays her hand as it seemed he hadn't lied yet. Though her arms try to comfort the woman, her gaze remains trained to the human, she wasn't going to let this one leave her sight.

**Just outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaa&#39;s Farm. Hunkered down in a stairwell like a trench grunt.**
The body language is unmistakable and familiar: Awkward. The expressions, pained, the tone, the same, the sound of mutual pain and understanding pushing its way around trying to balance out. ***Many voices carry further than oneâ€¦***, or so the saying goes. Naryen found her hand acting before the rest of her mind caught up. The snap of the fastener on the hip pouch was felt, not heard, as she put her sidearm away and leaned, back against the wall.
Trandosians. Slaves. Rasen, Dosennaa's husband, dying rather than be a part of it. Flashes from Kashyyk, the sounds the sights of dying Wookies and terrorists â€¦ no, freedom fighters, forced themselves forward again. ***No, this isnâ€™t the time, there are fresh wounds here, and may never be.*** He died while defending the defenseless, fighting against oppression and tyranny, just as Naryen desired herself, just as she took oaths for... but that seems so very long ago... but within her that hasnâ€™t changed.
Naryen let out a deep sigh as a wave of weariness rippled from her head and neck down her back to her limbs and she tilted her head back, eyes closed as the imagery ran its course, as the little womanâ€™s sobs carry to her ears. Her eyes tightened as memories of Varlbrindal and her parents empty eyes stared back at her and tears well up. Her head starts to ache and the rest of her follows in a near sickening wave as it reached a crescendo with the screaming getting all tangled in a mind bending mess mixing in the peaks of Dosennaaâ€™s cry.
***Iâ€™m so tired.*** Naryen starts to feels suddenly intensely dizzy and brings her head forward to her hand as a rushing sensation dulls out her senses, especially her hearing. She tries a few breaths to steady her head.
Glancing to one side and she opens her wet eyes to see Lahela standing at the base of the stairs looking up at her. Her grey-green eyes wide with concern and all too familiar fear showed ready and waiting. Naryen stiffened then put the reaction aside with trained reflex. She sniffed and straightened wiped her eyes with a smile, blinking back further tears
Calmly and with reassurance, mimicking her mother as best she can, **â€œWhat are you doing up?â€** Bittersweet. Naryen moves down the stairs, with a wipe at each eye.
â€œI heard someone crying and some noise at the door. Is everything ok?â€ Lahela was wearing an oversized light blue dress as a nightgown, her curly brown hair done in a bun on either side of her head, clutching a cushion to her body.
Naryen knelt down in front of Lahela, put a hand on her arm, smiled and opened her mouth to give her some pleasantry. She stopped short, looking in the eyes of a child that had seen so much and deserved better.
With a genuine smile, **â€œNo, everything is not ok, but it will be.â€** rubbing both of Lahelas shoulders, **â€ Dosennaa got some bad news but sheâ€™ll be ok. We all need to help out each other, but not right now,â€œ** slightly sterner tone and expression, **â€especially little girls that should be resting for a new day.â€** Smile widens.
Lahela smiles and Naryen feels her relax in her arms, just as a yawn so big it tips the little girl off balance, â€œOokaay.â€ She blinks and leans into Naryen who curls her up in her arms and stands walking back to the childrens room. Lahela is asleep before she gets her into the bed.
Leaving the room Naryen pauses once at the doorway to look over her shoulder at all the children now asleep, secure. She continues on with slumped shoulders and deeply fatigued smile and bleary eyes.
Staggering back down the hall, feeling the roughness of the walls, Naryen walks into the common room for the adults. She looks over at Dexter with envious eyes, and walks to bed against a wall to one side. She sits, back to the wall knees to her face, then curls forward with a sigh. She sobs once.
Naryen falls asleep so suddenly sheâ€™s doesnâ€™t even feel it.

Dexter awakes, looking into a room that is all to familiar to him. He is home. His parents house to be exact but this is impossiable he has not been home in years. But here he is, in his room that he hadn't seen in years. It looks the same as it had all those years ago before the Darktimes came into being. *"Wait I rember this night it was the night that….."* he hears the sound of boots in the hall and vocies metalic sounding like they where thought a commlink. His frist reaction is to hide, run. But he is to afraid to move.
The door to his room bursts open. A man dressed all in white armor looks in scanning the room with his weapon rasied and ready. Dexter is scared out of his mind he freezes in place not moving a muscle. The man in white turns and leaves the room not seeing him. He hears the sound of the his mother crying out and the sound of blaster fire and the thud of a bodie hitting the floor then another shot is fired and the sickening thud shortly after. Then he hears the sound of the men leave. He gets out of his bed and walks out into the hall. He sees a booted foot laying half out of his parents room. He slowing walks over to it and falls to his knees next to the body of his mother. The smell of ozone heavy in the air from the blaster rifle. He starts to cry placeing a hand on his mother trying to get to wake up. Screaming the same word over and over again and getting no reponse.
Back to in the real world.
Dexter wakes in a cold sweat. Looking around him he is in the farm house where he was when he fell asleep. Then he hears the sound of people talking and someone crying. He quickly finds his hold out and moves toward the door to the room. Looking up into the other room towards the enterance to the home. He moves quitely toward the enterance hold out at his side. He see the women that had opened her house to this collection of stranger that had wondered there way to her home, she is crying the quite twi-lek female comfronting her. He sees her hand quickly move toward her blaster then stop. He keeps moving toward the enterance. Moving close to the two women in the door way. "What is going on. The others are still asleep. I came up to make sure everything is ok, i can see that it is not." Dexter waits for a reaction out of the Twi-lak women on whether on not these men are friend of foe.
