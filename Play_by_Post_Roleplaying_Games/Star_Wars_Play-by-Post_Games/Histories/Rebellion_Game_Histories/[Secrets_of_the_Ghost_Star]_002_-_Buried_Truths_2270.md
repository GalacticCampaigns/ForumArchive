# [Secrets of the Ghost Star] 002 - Buried Truths

While walking through the hall, Kar had returned his large vibroblade to its place across his back. Now he reaches almost unthinkingly for the hilt. Ynna puts a hand on his arm to stop him, shaking her head slightly.
The Twi'lek at the table stands, spreading her arms wide.
'It is good to have you returned to us, and to see that the guests in our territory are safe and well. You must all be tired. Oorok, please provide refreshments.'
The Zabrak bartender nods, gesturing for you to come forward to the bar and place orders.

Ben not waiting for the rest walks up and order. "Coreillian Wiskey kind sir One for me and my friends." Ben turns and smiles. "Thought it would br nice to celeabate the fact we are alive." " And have hopefully made some new friends." Ben nods to the council and the people who ecourted them here.

A painted eyebrow arches at the situation that rapidly unfolds, but Vannara keeps herself still and calm. Only after the offer of refreshments are made does the woman move, by nodding her head to the other twi'lek woman. "We greatly appriciate your rescue, and your welcome," is offered in smoothe and gentle tones, the well-trained voice of a courtesan to be certain. As she lifts her gaze and lets her indigo eyes wander, Vannara takes in all of those in the bar, even the obvious black-robed strangers.
Without another word, Vannara moves away towards Oorok behind the counter. "Mandalorian wine if you have any. Otherwise, a fine Zabrak vintage will do. And still, if there is none, wine please, or perhaps some of this blue Tatooine water I have heard about," says the woman, again with those kind and gentile tones.
((OOC: Trying to get a discrete glance at the woman hiding her features. Otherwise, waiting for Kar to look at me when the other twi'lek isn't.))

Entry into the somewhat basic bar is easy enough, and is filled with various bits of information for Tanis and the rest of the party to aquire. With weapons still properly stowed, the idea of a drink at once seems good to the former merc as well as very bad. The soldier leans himself in a little closer to place his head between Vannara and Saden before whispering something to the pair.

Still uncomfortable within this space station Isshkazza, keeps to himself sitting close to his friends with his back to a wall. He keeps a closer eye on his new friends, and listens to all that transpires before him before making judgment. Isshkazza declines the offer of a drink politely with a nod back to the bartender and holds his bowcaster across his lap.

Yvanus slings his rifle over to his back as the Twi'lekian bodyguard leads them over to the bar. He nods amiably to the bartender as he sidles onto a barstool.
"Water, if you please. I've a sneaking suspicion that there will soon be a time for clarity. Besides, I don't think there's anyone here I need to make prettier… But the day is still young, yet."
The mandalorian turns slowly atop his barstool to regard the shrouded characters sitting at the center of the bar. His gaze is not at all discreet, as he awaits the arrival of his water.b

Oorok listens to the orders and pours out three measures of whiskey for Ben, Saden, and Tanis and for Vannara a glass of wine. Finally, he decants some water for Yvanus and, after a moments thought, some for Isshkazza too.
'On the house. You've just had a nasty shock after all.' He murmurs as he slides the glasses across the bar-top. He then turns to deal with the orders of Alayva's party, who have joined you at the bar.
Vannara, who tries to get a good look under the mysterious woman's cowl, catches a glimpse of powdery blue skin. Unnable to discern more, she watches Kar and the other Twi'lek woman until she is sure the latter isn't looking her way then uses the opportunity to deliver her lekku message.
The meeting at the table seems to have broken up upon your arrival, since the dark-skinned Zabrak appears far more interested by you than the members of the Council.
'Will these people too be offered a place here in your community, lady Eelya?' He queries, smiling pleasantly.
The Twi'lek woman answers:
'Naturally. It is not our way to shun outsiders.'
'Commendable, I do not doubt. Anon and I have been greatly impressed by your hospitality. Haven't we, Anon?'
The cowled woman nods.
'So...' Oorok asks, doing his best to keep his attention on you but continually glancing over to the table. 'Where are you all from originally. What do - or did - you do?'

Saden turns to Oorok, all smiles, keeping the hooded Anon in his peripheral vision.
"Oh, a little of this and little of that. We just try and keep busy. Hopefully, we can continue that on board this station. That is until we find a way off of course."

Ben decides to keep his mouth shut on this topic. After the last time he opened it maybe it is for the best. The whiskey is good and smooth burns on the way down and reminds him of simplar times before all of this. *"A little bit of home."* He thinks to himself. A smile play across his face.

Isshkazza nods to Oorok for the drink, then lifts his glass to his friends before taking a drink. At Oork`s question Isshkazza buffs out his chest stands to his full hight Isshazza then takes his seat again and continues to drink his water.

Oblivious to his new title as Lord of the Obvious, Tanis decides against a drink so indicated with a slight shifting of his head and eyes which close for but a split second. Following this the human male settles himself in behind the more diplomatic, simply observing all that he might be able to manage in the small bar. From types of people patronaging and their backgrounds, to what exits may be found and even any hints of just how peaceful, well kept and stable this 'bar' is.

"In the depths of struggle; in the midst of strife; in the chaos of battle is a warrior given life… Either there or Mandalore. Mostly I'm paid to shoot people then disappear. Not necessarily in that order."
The enigmatic mandalorian takes a deep draft from his glass of water, swirling the clear liquid in the glass until a tiny vortex forms at its center. He stares at this as if finding it most engrossing, although he keeps an ear to the various conversations floating around the bar.

'You wanna keep busy, huh?' Oorok smirks. 'Oh, they'll keep you busy. I'm glad I set up this bar or I'd be out on patrols or salvaging and foraging day in and out.'
'Mind you, bartering for the booze they find is an epic endeavour in and of itself. When it comes to trade, diplomats are worse than criminals.'
He looks down at the glass Tanis has rejected and, shrugging, knocks it back himself.

"They are quite likely patrolling for the safety of all in their care," states Vanarra smoothely, softly, after having been quiet for so long. Lekku twitch and rolls as the woman's indigo eyes lok about the 'bar', then she glances at the rest of her companions, letting her words fall to the breath of a whisper, "We should be listening to negotiations and the conversation at the table over there, to better gauge the extent of our circumstances."

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-16 20:04:53)

*Yes, but safety from what?* thinks Saden as he pretends to ignore the twilek.
"No offense Oorok, but your settlement seems to awfuly keen on defense when all we've heard about is automated droid patrols. More than likely we'll be venturing out there to find a way off this station. What should we prepare ourselves for? And how often do foragers head out?"

'This is neither the time nor the place for that kind of question.' Oorok replies, shaking his head. 'And I'm certainly not the best qualified to answer it.'
Over at the table, the conversation has remained seemingly mundane, the dark-skinned Zabrak agreeably answering questions about other communities he has visited around the Death Star - Gilded Cage evidently not being an isolated case. He has just finished describing one village of Ithorians who have converted the halls they live in with plants and precious earth brought with them from their herdship.
'Ah, if you will excuse me, I'm going to get another drink.' He says.
The Twi'lek woman, Eelya, smiles broadly and gestures for him to remain seated.
'Someone can bring a drink to you, don't trouble yourself.'
'It's no trouble. I can use the opportunity to introduce myself to the fascinating group at the bar. Anon, you should be sociable too.'
He beams and stands fluidly, making the few short strides over to the bar before another word can be said to stop him. His female companion nods her acceptance of his suggestion and makes a beeline for Kar. The Twi'lek warrior appears startled by the attention.
'So you're the latest unfortunates to join us here on the station?' The Zabrak asks upon arrival at the bar. 'I am En. Such a shame that we meet in these circumstances.'

Isshkazza`s attention is perked at the mention of a village of Ithorians who have converted the halls they live in plants and precious earth brought with them from their herdship. This reminds Isshkazza of home, shaking his head froma day dream in time to hear ('So you're the latest unfortunates to join us here on the station?' The Zabrak asks upon arrival at the bar. 'I am En. Such a shame that we meet in these circumstances.').
Isshkazza bows his head

"One man's cage is another man's tomb, or so it is said. At least the birds are pretty enough, yes?"
Yvanus offers the Zabrakian man an enigmatic smile before taking a careful sip from his water. The expression causes the imperial crest tattooed over the left side of his face to ripple as the Mandalorian regards En with a neutral gaze. Setting his glass aside, Yvanus folds his arms across his chest and leans against the bar, preparing himself to listen intently to what the newcomer is preparing to say.

'One of the same for me.' En adds, sliding some Imperial currency across the bar.
Oorok provides two more glasses and clears away the empty ones sitting on the bartop.
'It seems you've been brought in to a friendly part of the station at any rate.' En comments, taking his whiskey in hand. 'Not everyone is as lucky. There was no one but me and the droid patrols in the area where I was brought in. And then when I finally met anyone, turns out they were pirates. I escaped eventually, then crossed a powerless sector and found a small group of recluses on the other side. That's where I picked up Anon and now we travel together. It's dangerous, but someone has to do it. How else are we going to work out a way off?'
He looks around at the table where the Council sit, now talking amongst themselves in hushed tones. Drinks in hand, your guides have migrated to a nearby table with the exception of Kar, who continues to stand by the door talking to the cloaked woman Anon.
'I was hoping I'd find support here, but it's clear they think I'm crazy. The Twi'lek said people have tried and failed too many times for the idea to be taken seriously. Seems they'd rather live their lives here than risk those lives trying to get back to the galaxy they came from.'

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-21 06:10:55)

The imperial currency sends a warning bolt through Saden's mind. *There's always time to find out later whether he was paid it or found it.*
"I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd like off this station. We all have lives and duties in the galaxy. Accepting a prison, doesn't change that its a prison after all. Sounds like there are quite a few factions aboard this station and other hazards. Not to mention tension inside this community. Can an extra dozen hands be of any help in your plans?"

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **Anazider** (2007-11-22 22:50:34)

Yvanus quirks an eyebrow at En as he eyes the imperial credits. The mandalorian folds his arms across his chest while Saden speaks, his gaze drifting to the officer as he volunteers their services.
"Well, I dare say I've been speaking for myself all this time. Perhaps we should see which way the river flows before we cast our lines? The idea of a pure hunt, free of politics or bureaucracy does appeal to me."

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **master_Tru** (2007-11-23 05:57:15)

Isshkazza does not really pay much attention to the imperial credits, many use it in these times including himself on occasion. Isshkazza is interested in hearing about the different factions aboard the station, it changes the view of a sterile station of death to a living breathing world. Though still very uncomfortable on the death trap station Isshkazza sits quietly and listens to the stories being passed around (if one could imagine a large Wookie with his hands holding his face, day dreaming while those around him entertain him with stories of where they have been what they have seen).

### **Thandrim** (2007-11-23 10:31:37)

Still quietly watching, Tanis shifts a little in his obversational stance. What he might be thinking there, indeed whether he is thinking at *all* is a question hard to answer. Harder still as his eyes drift to the far wall, focused apparently upon nothing for the time being.

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **chibiamy** (2007-11-23 12:37:10)

Vannara gives En a warm smile as she sips from her wine. "Well then, indeed it seems we were lucky," she notes in an easy and quiet tone, her lekku slowly swishing back and forth. Indigo eyes dart over to Kar as En speaks of the Twi'lek, then she turns to look at the pink female twi'lik in the room, letter her lekku continue to swirls and twitch as they are often wont to do. "Where have you been so fortunate to travel then, good sir, about this station upon your most … epic of quests?" asks the woman now as she seems to turn the majority of her attention to the dark Zabrak.
But that is not entirely the case. Vannara waits for Kar to glance in her direction, the shifting of her lekku will turn purposeful then, rather than random. >

'Most communities I've visited are something like this one. Some are friendlier than others, some are downright aggressive taking whatever they need from others. And of course, there are faction divides because the station isn't picky about who it picks up. There's an Imperial community only a sector away; Lady Eelya led me to understand some trading is done with them. I heard a few stories several sectors ago about a nest of cannibal raiders. Fortunately, Anon and I avoided meeting them.'
Kar's response to Vannara's lekku communication is short and to the point: >

'Oh no, I met her at Scholar's Seat.' En replies. 'Anon was just itching to do something, to leave that community, so I took her with me. Kindred spirits, her and I, and we've travelled through quite a lot together. So as you noted we are very close friends.'
He looks over at his companion and chuckles.
'She's usually not very talkative among strangers. It seems she has taken a shine to that warrior.'

"So have you found away to get off this thing yet?" "Or is it a fool's earned like they are saying it is."

### **simplyscribed** (2007-11-28 15:09:20)

'I've thought about it, and I can only think of one way to get off.' En replies, turning his eyes on Ben.
'We would need to gain control of the systems governing an entire sector, so we could release a ship. We would also need to deactivate the systems running neighbouring sectors so that the escaping vessel isn't pursued. Doing so would spell doom for anything occupying the surrounding sectors... As well as whoever remained behind to deactivate the hangar's shields from control.'

" O. K. Doesn't sound to promising." " Well I guess stay here for awhile doesn't sound to bad. We can always help out with stuff here or in another community." Ben looks into his glass and that sence of hopeless comes flooding back. He remebers a time before he joined the Rebellion, how he did stuff that he wasn't pround of to survive. Then there was the time he lost everything because some Imp. officer thought shotting helpless people who only wanted to be heard was a great idea for croud control. Bad times that he would have rather left in the past. Ben finishes off his drink and looks at the man." Thanks for the info, if need anything just ask looks like I will be around for awhile."

"An interesting game you play, mister En. Sacrifice the few, to save the fewer still. Tell me, sir, who do you seek to save? Or, a better question, who do you wish to be rid of?" Yvanus moves a callused hand up to stroke his chin as he regards En with the same flat stare. The mandalorians glass of water remains all but forgotten as he awaits En's response.

'I don't recall saying it was a sacrifice I was happy and willing to make.' En replies, looking at Yvanus levelly. 'I am of the mind that just because I can think of only one solution, does not mean there are no others. Anon and I travel looking for a better means.'

Lekku twist and turn as Vanarra glances around the bar, twisting purposefully if Kar glances in her direction again, > The Twi'lek listens quietly, politely to various conversations, verious topics, without actually engaging in one, sipping at her wine until it is gone. She sets the glass upon the counter, then waves a hand over it, it seems she wants no more. Indigo eyes drift towards En, then they glance over at Anon and Kar, before returning to look at the council, bowing her head in respect with a warm courtier's smile for them.

Of a tactical mind presently, Tanis gains a slight smirk. "You are going about it the wrong way then. Shut down the security systems, all levels of it. If the primary security of this… station, is based on droids then there would be a means to accomplish that. Opening a much larger door for people to leave." As well as provide opportunity to destroy the place without destroying everyone on it. Though of course to the former merc, that second option is still quite viable, if it comes to it.

En raises an eyebrow in reaction to Tanis, then suddenly has his attention diverted by Isskazza. Clearly he understands Shyriiwook.
'Imperial, you say? Well that *is* interesting. Especially as I've not seen Imperial insignia, routines, or codes since I've been on the station. Except where I've met Imperials, of course.'
Vanarra finds her smile returned by those at the council's table looking in her direction at the time - the young Human woman and the Wookiee. She also sees the mysterious woman Anon getting very close to Kar, who keeps trying to extricate himself, looking uncomfortable.

"That is strange, this place wasn't build by the Empire." Ben looks at En. " We had assumed that the Empire had built this one as well." " This makes things alittle more interesting then, maybe we should stick around and find out who else has the ability to build one of these thing." Ben looks at his friends to see if they agreed with him on this. "Thank you for the information, i would be willing to help you if you needed it, if not I am sure I can find something to keep myself busy."

Saden gives Ben a glance trying to communicate his growing unease with the other patrons as subtly as possible.
" I second Ben's offer of aid. Many hands make light work somebody always said. We need to meet with the council first but we'll talk more."

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-03 11:35:47)

There comes a soft whisper from Vannara, to Tanis, whom she is near, hoping that En does not have good ears. She even makes certain to look away so he cannot read her lips. "Our rescuer Kar is in need of rescuing himself. If I went over there to do so, it would result in a catfight. Offer to buy him a drink, would you be so kind?" comes Vanarra's smoothe calm tone in but a breath. Then the woman begin glancing at the drinks behind the bar. If she is paying attention to the conversation around her, or even understands the Wookie, she is not showing it at this time.

---

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **Thandrim** (2007-12-05 14:36:44)

The low toned response to Vanarra's request is touched with somewhat cruel mirth. "You are far too merciful for your own good. Or is it something else?" The last is matched with a slightly raised eyebrow at the Twi'lek woman next to him. Nonetheless the former mercenary steps off with an amused grunt before Tanis breaks Kral's personal space barrier just as Anon had moments before. The human even props a hand on the Twi'lek warrior's shoulder before starting in. "-You- need to tell me just where you were when you aquired that weapon. And if there is anyone on this station that might have or make similar models."

'Yes', En responds, 'we will indeed talk more. I think it is time for me to return to the quarters I've been provided. Thank you for your company and conversation.'
He walks away, stopping at the Council's table to bid them farewell.
Kar allows himself to be led away from the door and towards the bar, flashing Anon an apologetic smile. The blue-skinned, cloaked woman watches him leave, then exits alongside En.
'It was custom made, a present from my father.' Kar says to Tanis. 'Though blastswords aren't entirely uncommon, I think this one may be unique in size.'

"Such a delightful fellow, with his talk of noble sacrifice and harrowed escape. I think I'll have that drink, bartender. Fist of Mandalore, straight with no chaser."
Yvanus slides his empty glass of water the length of the bar back towards Oorok as he eyes En and Anon. The mandalorian folds his arms across his chest, tapping a gloved hand against his chin in contemplation. He quirks an eyebrow at Kar and Tanis as the soldier rescues the twi'lek from his erstwhile besieger.

Isshkazza continues to drink his water while the others converse, taking everything in until he feels he has something to add. Isshkazza does eye the blastsword a fine weapon, but Isshkazza had never used such a weapon or felt the need to, his bowcaster had never let him down before. Isshkazza scans the room taking measure of all within and continues to sip at his water.

### **chibiamy** (2007-12-16 13:25:21)

Politely, Vannara bows her head towards En as the man excuses himself from the bar. There is no need to be anything but, after all. The twi'lek woman even offers the barest hint of an enigmatic smile before she returns to the wine she has been gently nursing since arriving into this part of the station. Indigo eyes follow Tanis and Kar, the woman's lekku twitching back and forth as she does so, before another glance is given towards the council's table. Pushing from the bar, and leaving her wine unfinished, Vannara makes certain to pass Tanis and Kar, placing them between herself and the council as her lekku take on a purposed twitch. >
Vannara then approaches the council table, curtsying with fluid and practiced grace. "Great council, I give you many things to rescueing us from our own ignorance of this station, earlier," drawls the woman with courtly grace. "Please, now I must beg of you more. We are new to this place and know not what we have stumbled onto, so to speak. Would you care to inform us travelers of what this is, how long people have been trapped here, and what attempts have been made to leave?"

Nodding as he talks with Kar, Tanis's lips work in a thought. "Indeed I know I've not seen one that length. Your father is a weaponcrafter then? Or did he commission the tool? I think it'd work well for defense, the intimidation factor alone standing well hmm?" A small smirk take to those lips then as he adds in more quiet tones, "I suppose it can also *attract* attention as well."

### **simplyscribed** (2007-12-17 18:46:15)

Oorok provides Yvanus with his requested drink then leans on the bar.
'The tension just plain melted away there. They were obviously unnerving our esteemed council-members with that talk of escape.'
Isshkazza examines the occupants of the room, and in doing so catches the eye of the wookiee at the council's table. The elder lifts a shaggy hand to wave him over. Saren too casts a discerning gaze over the proceedings. Opportunities seem to be limited to three choices: Conversation with the bartender, joining the guide group (now happily chatting over drinks), or visiting the table occupied by the council.
A choice, it seems, that Vannara has made. As she passes Kar he gives an affirmative response with his headtails. In general, the council seem pleased with her politeness, though the Trandoshan merely rolls his eyes. The Twi'lek woman, apparent *de facto* spokesperson for the group and easily Vannara's elder, both facts making her worth of additional respect (even if feigned), smiles appreciatively.
'First, you must allow me to express our humblest apologies that we let the matter of your arrival in our community go unresolved for so long. Two sets of unexpected guests in one day was unusual enough to make meaningless our normal protocols.'
At Tanis' questions, Kar nods.
'Yes, my father makes weapons. He is a highly respected craftsman on Ryloth, and specialises in exotic weapons, particularly those usually constructed on other worlds. His pieces are sought after by collectors.'
The warrior seems proud of his father's accomplishments, being far more talkative and expressing more obvious emotion now than he has previously.
'A few fools have hoped to steal it, it is true.'

Ben sets back against the bar and looks around. Thinking to himself."This place isn't any differnt then any other canteena I have been in." "People talking drinking, not so bad." Ben turns his head and looks at the bartender. "So Barkeep anything interesting happen around here other then us?" Ben thinks to himself that he might as well talk to someone.

Again Vanarra bows her head in respect, and if she can catch the Trandoshian's eye, she will even wink with the slyest of smiles. "It is understood, and we are not offended," offers Vannara to the elder twi'lek in a polite and even sweet, submissive tone. "Obviously, it was something of importance that kept your attention. We are merely new arrivals with far too many questions, one might even consider us liken to children in this place," notes the younger of the twi'lek women. "When you have the time and opprotunity, we would be greatful to have our eager questions answered. Most intriguing is this place, and frightening in it's own menacing manner. But I do believe we should also humbly ask for rooms. It has been a long, exciting day, and rest must come soon. There is a little time yet, at your discression, however."

'Apart from you and the other strangers? Well now... I lost a shipment of spiced wine being brought by those damned Imps. They say they were attacked and had it stolen, but no one can find a trace of it. If you ask me that money-grubbing booze-hoarding son-of-a-mynock Captain Isolt is trying to swindle me out of my due.'
---
The wookiee elder rumbles, gesturing for Isshkazza to pull up a seat.
The Twi'lek smiles and waves a bejeweled hand dismissively.
'Please, please, such formality! Rooms are already being taken care of, Fil is on standing orders to get it seen to when newcomers arrive. Now, you are quite right to have questions and we will do our best to provide answers. But first, introductions. I am Eelya, and my friends and colleagues here are Grorrl, Ssurk, and Kristi.'
She points at the wookiee, the trandoshan, and finally to the human woman.
'Together we comprise the elected council of Gilded Cage and oversee its day-to-day affairs. Grorrl is in charge of entertainment and leisure, Ssurk is our resident security expert, Kristi is a political advisor and a veritable storehouse of knowledge, and I am an accomplished diplomat. You must introduce yourselves to us so we can speak on friendly terms. What are your names? Where are your homeworlds? What line of work are you in?'

"Lying, cheating, stealing Imperials you say? I suppose we'll have flying birds and swimming fish next, yes?"
Yvanus smiles a crooked smile before taking a sip of his drink, stilling his face against the inevitable burn as the alcohol rages down his throat. He scans the common room through half-lidded eyes, glancing from the council group to the guide group, looking for any sign of a scout, or one familiar with the hunt. The mandalorian continues to listen intently for anything that might remotely pique his interest.

Tanis engages a smirk at Kar and the tiniest hint of a laugh. "Not an easy mark to achieve I'd think. Stealing that from the son of it's maker. Still worth seeking out when time and freedom permits." The former merc looks more closely as Eelya introduces herself and companions as those in charge of the 'settlement.' That smirk switches over to a small frown, there is just too much a sense that these people aren't interested in leaving. Yet for the moment, the human remains quiet, prefering others to introduce themselves first while he can yet claim to be distracted by Kar and his blastsword.

"I am certain we have much to talk about indeed. But I am feeling a bit … faint and must eat. And then if I could rest, it has been a rather long day, travelling through the small spaces of this … vast ship, to get to the sanctuary of Gilded Cage. If, perhaps, further introductions, at least on my part, could be given tomorrow? I would most appriciate it."
Vannara then glances around to the others she came with, indigo eyes curiously watching each one, even those escorts still in the 'bar' that lead them here.

Grorrl is in the middle of explaining the life-debt he owes Eelya, the reason for his presence in her retinue at its time of capture by the station fifteen years ago, when Eelya replies to Vanarra:
'Not at all, dear. We can adjourn until tomorrow.'
She withdraws a small commlink unit from within her robes and lifts it to her lips, clicking it on.
'Fil, are the rooms ready?'
The reply comes clear through the unit's built in speakers: 'Yes ma'am. They're in the pilot's quarters, you wanna send them over?'
'Yes, they'll be on their way soon.'
'Right.'
Eelya smiles widely, putting down the commlink.
'Then all you need is a guide, dear. Perhaps you would like to talk to Kar of Ryloth? It has been a long time since he - or I, for that matter - have seen our home.'

It has been some time since Isshkazza has been to his home world therefore sometime since he had spoken to another of his kind.

"I wouldn't mind hearing more about this Captain Isolt another time... I've a pretty good record when dealing with imperial officers. But for now, it seems time to nest-down. Hopefully someone has lined the Cage well, eh?" The mandalorian hitches his longblaster on his shoulder, waiting for the Twi'lek warrior to lead the way.

Still, perhaps I have news you have not heard, and I am more than willing to share." Vannara turns to the others and nods with a smile. "Please stay, my friends. I am not used to such adventures as this, is all. Rest here, enjoy the drink, and companionship found. I shall see you soon enough in the morn," she notes in a formal and eloquent tone.

"Well, suppose I could hear a bit more about this Captain Isolt. Tell me, do you know of any good places to hunt around here, eh?" The mandalorian speaks over his shoulder to Orook as he reclines against the counter top.

'It seems duty calls.' Kar murmurs to Tanis. He walks toward the door to meet Vannara.
One of the Gilded Cagers - probably the Bothan Vexx - wolf-whistles. Laughter from the whole group (including Grorrl, Kristi, and Ssurk from the council) conceals the guilty party from Kar, who, clearly embarassed, turns to glare ineffectually at them.

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **simplyscribed** (2008-01-18 19:40:26)

((OOC: Read the following post only if you care about the private conversation between Vannara and Kar.))
[hide]Kar escorts Vannara from the bar, turning left and walking down the featureless corridor. He seems noticeably more relaxed now that the cloaked strangers are elsewhere
Vannara glides along, just as she has long since been trained to do. Once the pair are a safe distance from the bar, she turns her indigo eyes curiously on the other twi'lek, looking over him before smiling softly. "Was it really that bad? Is she a former lover that left?" asks Vannara. "You were so tense, on edge. Forgive the blunt question, but... I was curious."
'No!' The warrior blurts out, embarrassed. 'She was just... very forward.'
Vannara tilts her head to the side, her lekku twitching in warm amusement as she continues to smile at Kar, pausing her steps to turn and look at him.
"Why are you embarrassed. You are rather handsome, you know," says the teal twi'lek before hsaking her head.
"When a woman is forward, she is lonely, and attracted. I will try to refrain from being so, if you wish, Kar," she adds gently.
Vannara then turns and starts to walk again, perhaps swaying her hips just a bit more. Perhaps they always swayed that much.
"What faction are they from? Those two that came? And I hope you don't mind my asking for my friend to come rescue you from their clutches. I would like to know more about this place. Thus, i ask you, because I feel I will not need to dance for hours in the midst of a political ocean to get the truth."
Kar's skin darkens yet further, his lekku writhing from further embarrassment mixed with pleasure at the compliment... and implications.
'It is more than I can handle.' He admits. 'As a professional bodyguard I had few relationships, and I have been on this station with no partner for years.'
'I do not know what faction they belong to. As far as I know, their story is true, though it's the first time we've had visitors from a far-flung part of the station.'
"I believe," says Vannara smoothly, "You are selling yourself short."
The woman nods and a smile curves at her lips as she looks down the corridor, rather than Kar for now.
"That is most interesting. Would you tell me their story as we walk?" she asks, lifting a hand and motioning forward like the skilled courtsean that she is, a motion that is both pointing forward, and in invitation for Kar to take her hand.
Not being knowledgeable in the subtle signs of the diplomat, Kar seems oblivious to that invitation. He does begin walking, and seems happy enough to oblige Vannara with the information she seeks:
'Anon said she came from a small community of recluses called Scholar's Seat, when the zabrak arrived. Seeking adventure and an escape from the station, she agreed to travel with him. They've travelled and survived the dangers of the station since, but found no way to escape yet.'
"And what do you think, Kar? Of escaping the station?" asks Vannara curiously. "I do not know the dangers of it yet, so I admit to being hopefully optimistic. Odd, actually, I am usually a cynic."
'Everyone thinks that way at first.' He says sadly, nodding. 'But those that have tried... have all been lost to us. That is why Anon's story is so amazing.'
At that, Vannara reaches out, gently, for Kar's hand, wrapping it within her own.
"How long have you been here, Kar?" she asks, tilting her head to the side just enough that as her lekku twitch, one lightly brushes Kar's. "Tell me more of Anon's story, please?"
Kar's hand is rough and calloused, the mark of a worker - a warrior. He looks down at Vannara's hand over his, silent for a moment. 'Five years. And I'm afraid there's not much more I can tell you about their journey. I met them at the same time you did. I suppose though, that if anyone can escape this station, it must be them. They are amazing and tenacious to have come so far.'
"You do not know my friends yet," notes Vannara, with a hint of laughter.
"Our first impression when we saw this, Well, it must be destroyed. The Empire cannot get it," she notes, before shaking her head, still holding Kar's hand. "But now that there are people here, well, now we must plan, and learn all we can of this station, so that we can help ever single person escape before we destroy it. I understand this has been your home for quite some time, but... wouldn't you rather be somewhere else, with real air, real breezes, real ... sunlight dancing on your skin?"
'I suppose we have all just become accustomed to it.' Kar admits, lekku moving in a way that signifies shame. 'A few have even found a way to grow comfortable. Myself... I gave my word that I would protect the people of Gilded Cage. I cannot do that if I try to leave.'
"Unless they are leaving as well," notes Vannara with a faint nod, one lekku reaching out to stroke one of Kar's that acts in shame. "And I would not suggest that they leave, until a way is found. And would it not be protecting them, getting them to leave this dangerous place, for someplace more secure, a place of better safety?"
'That depends. Is the Empire gone?' Kar asks, eyes suddenly blazing. His own lekku wraps around Vannara's seemingly of its own volition. 'All of us here left a Galaxy of darkness and oppression. True, there are Imperials with us on the station, but their numbers are finite. They can be resisted.'
"I wish I could tell you it was gone, Kar. But it is not yet. We fight it, still, and we maintain hope. Which is what will kill the Empire in the end, our hope," says Vannara, her lekku squirming happily in Kar's. "I am one that fights the Empire, Kar. It is true, I was captured when I was young, and sold to a Zabrak prince as a slave. But he was good to me, and taught me much. The Empire destroyed the life I was ... happy with, for the Prince did not treat me as slave, but as friend, when they killed him for resisting them. I have fought them ever since. And our numbers grow."
There is a pause, and Vannara gives the twi'lek man a warm smile as she pauses and steps a little closer.
"You do not have to fight the Empire, Kar. I am not asking you to do that. But I am asking you to consider helping us find a way to help free these people from their ... Gilded Cage, so that they can then make their own decisions of how they want to live. This place, more complacent, is no better than the other worlds of the Galaxy that do nothing about the Empire, complacent and hoping it will just go away."
Kar looks away guiltily, clearly affected by her words. His lekku goes limp and falls away from the grasp of Vannara's. 'What would you have me do?' He murmurs.
Vannara pauses, her eyes alight with concern as she pull son Kar's hand to twist him back towards her.
"First, do not look away from me. That is what I would have you do. Secondly, help us?" she asks, tilting her head to the side, her lekku actively trying to twine with Kar's, her hand squeezing his. "We need to know what -YOU- know of this station, what everyone knows of this station. There were ships taken, they must be somewhere. That is the key to getting everyone out, freeing the ships, after all. And please... smile at me?"
Kar swallows as he is forced to look at Vannara. She can see his expression is troubled. 'I will do all I can for you, you have my word.' He finally says, the words coming out somewhat hoarse. 'But right now I cannot smile. You have made me see myself as a coward for the first time in my life.'
Vannara reaches up, and she smiles at Kar, her freehand tracing over the man's cheek to rest at the corner of his lips. "I did not say you were a coward. You were singularly focused on your duty. A oath you swore to your father, would be my guess if I took one. Honor is an important thing to have in these times where so many forget it," softly croons Vannara as she strokes Kar's cheek. "It is the brave man that chooses it."
The Twi'lek warrior reaches up to take Vannara's hand. 'You are kind to say so. But I wonder what your interest is in me specifically. Any number of the other citizens of Cage could give you more of the information you seek than me. I know how to
fight and how to defend, that's my limit.'
"Because I trust you?" suggests Vannara truthfully, squeezing that hand of Kar's as it grasps hers. "You have been here five years, you know who will speak truthfully, you know who will not. And, perhaps, I miss my own kind, and hope to find a common bond with you."
'I'm not sure how possible that will be. Your desire to escape will take you away from Gilded Cage.' Could it be? Kar actually sounds like he might be regretful.
Vannara steps closer still, smiling at Kar. "But I will return," she notes softly, she promises it. "Shall... we spend time together while we have it, Kar?"
'I think...' He pauses, eyes reflecting an inner search for the confidence to continue. '...I would like that.'
Vannara gives that warm, gentle smile to Kar, urging confidence in the man. "As would I," she says softly, before reaching up and trying to gently place her lips on the twi'lek's. Just briefly. A faint gentle kiss, before she settles back again. "Will you guide me to my room?"
'Yes.' He replies, finally giving Vannara the smile she asked for. Taking her hand, he leads her to the quarters she has been assigned.[/hide]

The night passes comfortably in the rather spartan quarters to which you are assigned in the same corridor at the edge of the inhabited area of Gilded Cage.
When morning arrives, an automated alarm abruptly ends your dreams and brings you back to the waking world. Kar, who appears to have stayed the night with Vannara, is present to guide you back through the passages to the canteen. It is filled with representatives of all manner of races eating their breakfast; you are the center of much interest from them all. Greetings are called out from all over the hall, and a roar from Grorrl over at the table where the council is sitting draws your attention. The wookiee gestures to empty seats at the table, clearly expecting you to join them.

Vannara gives Kar a demure smile after the welcoming roar from Grorrl, lingering with just a bit of hesitaion. "You will join us, won't you?" she asks softly, and in invitation, before she nods to the others and turns her attentions to the council's table.
Walking over, Vannara is all soft smiles and soft words for the council, tipping her head respectfully to them as she greets them. "Thank you for the rooms, it was a pleasent night's rest. They are quite comfortable, " she notes, fully expecting some snickering, but clearly unashamed. "Now, Councilwoman Eelya, I do believe you were prepared to be speaking to us last night, when I so rudely requested to rest instead.

Yvanus notices as he looks at the meals of those you pass that the majority seem to be eating porridge, though there is some meat and breads on the table as well.
Councilwoman Eelya smiles knowingly as Vannara all the while the younger Twi'lek speaks, then gestures with her spoon for those who haven't to sit down.

Vannara bows her head with a nod and a smile to Ealya at that knowing smile in her direction. Settling into her chair, the turquoise twi'lek woman lets her lekku twitch, even as she reaches under the table to calmly and reassuringly put a hand on Kar's knee. (Only his knee, mind you!) "I was captured by a waring faction when I was rather young," notes Vannara simply. After all, that is a way of life Ryll. "Then I was sold as a slave to a Zabrak Prince. It wasn't actually such a bad life, and I was not really a slave save for the fact that money was exchanged in the process. I was trained as a courtesan by the Prince's people, and we were friends." There is a faint pause, and Vannara pulls in her breath slowly, as if trying to calm herself. "And then he travelled away on business while I was entertaining some guests that had arrived at his palace. While away, he was killed by the Empire, and before other most unpleasent men could decide I was part of the Prince's assests, I left. Now, I find work where I can, doing what I can. I was on my way to help with some trade negotiations when we were pulled aboard the station," drawls the woman easily, before looking at Kar, then the others of the group that arrived with her. "We were all part of that same attempt at transaction, in varying rolls. Pilot, bodyguard, co-pilot, mechanic, etc. It hasn't even been long enough for us to get to adequately know each other, at least to my likings, and yet, here we are now."

Yvanus orders a serving of porridge and a glass of water to go with it. He takes a seat in one of the available chairs, leaning back in it as he listens to Vannara recite her story. When the courtesan's introduction draws to a close, he laces his fingers behind his head and gazes up at the cantina's ceiling.
"Sergeant Yvanus Targo, Alliance Special Forces 1st Division, 5th regiment, Sniper unit. I tend to hide, shoot people from long distances, then run away. I also like mupples, and long walks by starlight..." The mandalorian says this with an absent dryness.

Ben orders some caf and looks around to see what everyone else is having, then orders some food for himself. "I am glad we ran into some people so helpfull around here." "I hope we can repay the kindness you have shown us." "I always repay my debts. Well there was that one time but it involed blaster pionted at me and..." "Never mind." Ben smiles hopingnoone was pay to close attention.

'Alliance? The Rebel Alliance?' The Trandoshan Ssurk asks before Eelya can continue her politcking. He leans forward in his chair, clearly extremely interested in this news. While the other council members become alert and curious too, Eelya sighs gently and shoots Ssurk a look of long-suffering.
At this point servers appear to take breakfast orders, and even impatient Ssurk holds his tongue while they do.
Grrorl rumbles to Isshkazza as they leave.

"The battle does not go well." "There are too many factions and the Empire is coming back with a vengeance, at least last we knew." Ben looks at his coffee. "But I am sure that the good guys will win as always." " So what of the other groups around here any of them as friendly as you guys?"

Yvanus glances at Ssurk while placing his breakfast order.
'Yes... The Rebel Alliance. And its not been all bad; least the fighting's been decent. The Imperials so despise having their noses tweaked, and we've been quite capable of that."
The mandalorian laces his fingers together once more, and cradles his head with them, running his gaze over the assembly.
"Rather interested in the galaxy at large, are we not? Although I suppose clip-winged birdies still remember the sky, yes..."

Vannara glances calmly at the others in her group, her lips twisting in just the right way with an arching of her eyebrow to suggest perhaps she does not know as much about her 'friends' as she thought. A glance back to Eelya and Vanarra bows her head slowly. "Forgive this intrusion into the conversation, Councilor Eelya. Apparently men only wish to hear of battle and war," she drawls with the barest hint of a tease.
"We were, as I recall, speaking of what brought us here to this Ghost Station," notes e younger of the two twi'lek women at the table. "Well, I've spoken the truth. Aside from my compatriots varying degrees of apparent association with the Rebellion, I was asked to do the negotiations on a transaction with these men. They are good men, at heart, if not a little to pre-occupied with matters to hold a friendly conversation and learn about where we are now. Please, Councilor, tell me, whence come you and how did you come about being here?"

'I have been on this station for fifteen years.' Eelya replies. 'I was a diplomat working for the Republic senate, before it was dissolved. Having returned to Ryloth, I worked for my own planet's government for several years until this station plucked my transport out of the sky. Grorrl, who has a life-debt to me, was with me at tthe time. How long the station has existed is unknown to me, only that it is older than those fifteen years. We met with some other victims, and began establishing our Gilded Cage. Others have arrived throughout the years, though I don't doubt many are directed to other parts of the station. The Imperial camp nearby and the tales of our other guests support this. Regardless, you should know that we have lost many good men and women to escape attempts, and this council cannot condone such an action on your part. It is of course your decision, and we will not force you to stay. But now you are aware of our position on the issue.'
Even Ssurk nods.
'I don't believe the station is to be feared.' He comments in croaking Basic. 'Do not underestimate it, though.'

Yvanus quirks an eyebrow at the trandoshan, a slow sneer creeping across his lips.
"Well, looks like someone has lost their hunter spirit. What would the Scorekeeper say, eh?"
The mandalorian looks from Ssurk to Grrorl and grunts. He grunts, taking his hands from behind his head and folding his arms across his chest.
"Although I suspect she would have much to say about this arrangement... But I suppose the jist is don't rattle the cage, don't ruffle any feathers, and we can fly as we see fit, yes?"

Yvanus has barely finished his comment when Ssurk erupts out of his chair with a roar, leaning over the table and grabbing his head in the clawed hand of one long arm. Ignoring the cries of dismay and reproval from his colleagues and others around the canteen, the Trandoshan slams Yvanus' head forward into the table.
'How is that for ruffling feathers?' He hisses through pointed teeth, glaring down at the dazed man with disdain.
Eelya reaches up to grasp Ssurk's arm firmly. Of the rest of the council, only Grrorl has reacted, but only to make an expression that seems to indicate he feels that Yvanus deserved what he got.
'Enough.' She says, voice brimming with a quiet power.
Ssurk looks at her and shrugs.
'My point has been made.'
'My, my. What an unpleasant affair to set the standard of the day.' The voice of En carries across the canteen, from where he and Anon now stand at the door. 'Can we be of any assistance?'

With all the commotion from the Trandosian and vivid memories from his home world Isshkazza bursts out of his chair draws his bowcaster and takes aim at the Trandosian Ssurk. Not sure if the Trandosian understood and not really caring Isshkazza lets out a mighty roar, Isshkazza knows one way or another the Trandosian understands him. Isshkazza does not lower his bowcaster, rather stands and holds aim on the Trandosian.

Yvanus places a hand on one of Isskazza's massive furry arms, partly in effort to placate the wookie, but more to steady himself against beginning signs of a mild concussion. The mandalorian rises slowly against the dizziness he feels, reaching his free hand to pluck out a cracked tooth and toss it in an available trash receptacle.
"...I forgot about the 'long-arms' thing. Good to see you've still some fighting spirit left to you. Was beginning to worry that all this talk of fear and caution and... complacency, had made you dull."
He turns at the sound of the other two newcomers, offering them a stained-tooth grin through the rivulets of blood pouring from his nose and mouth.
"Morning En, Anon. A bit of... aggressive negotiating taking place, but I think we are coming to a tentative understanding, yes?"

Watching the trandotion slam the mandos head into the table. Bens head moves from what it is doing to his blaster. About to draw he sees the wookie jump up and take aim at the Trando. Roaring at him as if he was going to kill him. "Friend that is agood way to get yourself intop a whole lot of trouble." Ben says to the Trando. Then he sees the Mando warrior put a hand on the wookie as to try to com him down. "We have been pretty neihgborly so far." Ben trys to look as menaceing as posible.

'No.' Kar says quietly, from his place next to Vannara. '*We* have been pretty neighbourly so far. Meanwhile, your friend just insulted Ssurk's warrior's honour and suggested he no longer held favour in the eyes of his Goddess. And that he shouldn't be sitting at the same table as Grrorl, he should be trying to kill him. There has been only one villain in this exchange, and it wasn't our council member.'
It becomes apparent his blade made the switch from his back to his hands at some point, as he now lifts it above the edge of the table and places it in front of him.
'And if you think you represent a world of trouble for Ssurk, imagine how much trouble *you'll* be in if either of you pull those triggers. There's a good several dozen people in here willing to take his side, and a fair few Gilded Cage citizens not present.'
The twi'lek warrior gestures around. Indeed, it does seem like everyone in the room is suddenly armed.
'Help yourselves out. Stop being frakking idiots.'
En and Anon move smoothly through the weapon-wielding diners, seemingly unconcerned.
'It does seem like you're in the wrong, friends.' The zabrak comments placatingly, 'and you should learn you won't survive long here on the station - or anywhere else in the Galaxy - if you point weapons at your hosts. Pick your battles, sure, but pick them when it favours you.'

"I think you should try alittle less harder to find a fight my friend." "I also think you should apolagize for what you said, don't you."

Vannara has kept silent during this exchange, completely unphased by the sudden violence, of the sudden armament of the populace. Indeed not even her lekku are twitching. But then, only those that know a twi'lek well would realize just how dangerous and angry that means the woman is at this point. Still, when she does speak, it is with calm, even, measured words.
First she nods to Kar, then she gives Eeyla one as well, her lekku finally moving, > they note.
Then Vannara glances at Grrorl, Ssursk, and finally Yvanus. "A warrior is always testing those he meets, to gain their mettle, their measure. I am going to assume that my companion is no except to this," she offers slowly, her indigo eyes slowly moving over to En, lifting her chin a little. "I believe the boundaries have been successfully tested," she notes to the Zabrak.
Finally she turns to Grrorl and rises. Pushing her chair back, she moves around Kar to stand next to the two Wookies, her head bowing as she seems almost submissive. "Please forgive Isshkazza, Councilman. This is a new and strange environment for many of us. It may well take some time to adjust. As such, Isshkazza was defending his friend, honoring his life-debt among relative strangers. Forgive me for saying this, but I see nothing foolish in his actions, I see honor and a necessity born of the unfamiliar. Do you not agree? I have no doubt, however, that the two of you would very much like speaking to one another of your homes, your families," she states slowly. "Forgive me for being so bold as to suggest the pair of you take some time to do so, and thus get acquainted and remove the unfamiliarity between the pair of you?"
With that done, Vannara's indigo gaze glances towards Eeyla and a faint lifting of an eyebrow is given to the elder twi'lek before Vanarra settles into her seat once more next to Kar. As subtly as she can manage, the woman reaches out trying to wrap her fingers around the warrior's hand.

Amidst some of the other patrons, Tanis has seen out the incident with an eyeball and little more on the issue. The nearness of several others and their immediate alliances ensured that a bold display by himself would not play well here, and it does not pay for a mercenary to make enemies. Enemies do not pay, friends do. Not that he really is a merc anymore, but old habits die hard. With a slow shake of his head, the human lets out a quiet exhale and attempts to re-engage in a touch of minor conversation of life and means on the station.

## Re: 002 - Buried Truths

### **simplyscribed** (2008-02-22 19:23:48)

Grorrl smiles. To those unused to a wookiee, such a smile can be alarming and even downright frightening, but Vannara has spent enough time in their company to be able to tell.
'Well,' Eelya says, nodding to Vannara, 'it is done now, nothing can change that. We had better see to first aid.'
As the younger Twi'lek seeks Kar's hand, the elder directs one of the serving staff to bring over a medkit. He does so, but is intercepted by Ssurk.
'I will do it.' The Trandoshan insists, taking the kit and turning to examine the damage he has done to Yvanus' face.
Vannara takes Kar's hand - he has by now returned his weapon to his back - but finds him unresponsive. His eyes move from Yvanus and Ssurk to En and Anon, and he seems tense.
The latter pair take seats nearby, and Eelya apologises for their unfortunate welcoming to breakfast. At this point everyone's food arrives.
Grorrl continues to speak with Isshkazza, exchanging stories of their respective families and homes. Meanwhile, Tanis and Ben talks with Kristi, the young human council member. She explains the duties and routines of a Gilded Cage citizen - most perform shifts on patrols, and on more mundane duties such as food service. A few who provide services for the community, such as Oorok the bartender and the duty medics, spend most or all of their time performing the one job. Leisure time can be spent in the canteen, the bar, the gym, or the common room. The latter has a good selection of holovids and games.

Yvanus stares incredulously at Ben at the mention of an apology, before turning to eye Ssurk as the Trandoshan comes over with med-kit in hand. With the situation diffused, the sniper falls into his seat, not needing to support himself against Isshkazza any longer.
"Thus ends the negotiations. And we were beginning to learn so much about one another."
He surprises Ssurk with a bloody, gap-toothed smile, giving an air of ease while not fully relaxed within the seat.

Ben exhales. "Well, food looks good." Realizing that is probably the closes he will get to hearing an apolgy from his Mando friend. "So if we where to head out and do some exploring what direction would you suggest?" "We should at least frimilarize ourselves with our serounding."

'I learned that you bleed easy.' Ssurk agrees. 'I would not say that it was a particularly productive outcome.'
Continuing to be aware of Isskazza's attention, he eventually gives him a toothy - no, fangy - grin.
Grorrl says, following the younger wookiee's gaze.
At Ben's request, Kristi withdraws a datapad from a pocket and opens up a map. The image on screen is the entire station, but details are only picked out on one portion of the sphere. She zooms in to that part.
'Here. This is where we are. If you leave Gilded Cage out of the South exit, you will eventually come to the Imperial Enclave.' She instructs, pointing first to a green marker toward the top of the map, then describing a line with her finger across a clear territory divide and finally to a red marker. You could try and bypass them, but it is questionable whether they will let you. To the North and West, there are a lot of power malfunctions and it is very dangerous. Some of the nearer danger areas are known and marked on, but we have not ventured beyond them. To the East, is where you came from. You will continue to pass through our sector until you reach a point where the doors are all sealed against the vacuum of space. Apparently that part of the station is either damaged, or incomplete.'
'If you have a datapad of your own, I can give you a copy.' She offers, looking from Ben to Tanis.

"Interesting, I take it the Imperials are trying to grab as much as they can?" Ben looks over the map some more. "I don't have a datapad but Tanis might." "The map would be invaluable to us." Ben looks around at the council members and his friends. "You have been very generous to us and I feel the need to repay you some how. Is there anything I or we can do to help you out?"

Indigo eyes sweep from one speaker to the next, from one conversation to another as Vannara sits quietly at Kar's side. She does not display an air of posessiveness, despite the desire to do so as En and Anon walk in, and Kar goes tense. Instead, calmly, Vannara squeezes the man's hand even more, letting that hold linger, before she squietly returns her hand to her own lap.
A bow of Vannara's head goes to Grrol and Isskazza. "It also depends on what the object of the outing may be, my Wookie Friend," she notes to the younger of the men from Keshyyk. "It sounds to me that one does not want to wander this station aimlessly, but with a definite plan, destination and objective in mind."
Indigo eyes dance towards Ben, before looking back to the table. "Indeed, desperate times means desperate allies. And while the Imperials may not be our friends, there is no need to provoke them, unnecessarily. I am interested," notes the twi'lek woman as her gaze seeks out Eeyla, "What might a small group such as ourselves do to prove our worth in this community."

Shaking his head slightly, Tanis indicates and replies in the negative. "I am not so well equipped this trip. But we can study and memorize until we salvage something more appropriate, thank you." Looking to Kristi he considers a moment before inquiring further. "Is there a more extensive map of the station, or is each community's own data pretty well kept to themselves I wonder?" He won't comment on repayment, as it appears other members of the little band he is a part of are already inquiring on it.

'We did find a map of the station,' Kristi admits to Tanis, 'but I can't show it you you. The file was corrupt so we couldn't glean anything from it. It contaminated several other files before we were able to wipe it.'
Eelya considers Vannara's question. Before she can aswer though, En speaks up:
'May I suggest something, Lady Eelya?' He asks, glancing to the Twi'lek.
'Why... yes.' She answers, somewhat taken aback.
'Perhaps they could prove their worth by assisting in the escort of Anon and myself to the border of your territory.'
'You are leaving us so soon? I hope you have not found your stay inhospitable.'
'Not at all,' En assures, 'but we have much to do that we cannot do if we stay here, as pleasant as that would be.'
'Well,' Eelya ponders, 'yes, yes. That seems like a reasonable task. We will send a few of our own with you. Perhaps Kar and Alayva, since they are already familiar. And... Maros. What say you all?'
She looks around at her fellow council members. Grrorl shrugs, indicating with a roar that he trusts Eelya's judgement. Ssurk takes a moment, then nods. Kristi offers a "Sounds good" as she keys her datapad to minimize the map.
Moments after, Kristi's datapad issues a single, shrill ring.
'It's a call from Fil.' She says, checking the screen. Apparently her datapad has a built in comm unit, probably a custom job.
'Public or private?' Eelya asks briskly.
'Public.' Kristi replies. 'I'll put him on. Here. You're through, Fil.'
'Thanks Kristi.' The voice of the human youth who'd been guarding the door when you entered Gilded cage the day before comes through with only a slight background hiss. 'I figured you folks would want to know - we've got company incoming. Imperials.'
'Today?' Ssurk hisses. 'They aren't due for half a standard week.'
'I'll be sure to ask why they're here early.' Eelya sighs. 'We'll have to see them, though.'

"That is quite enough, Ben," says Vannara in a smoothe and regal tone, her indigo eyes turning to look at the warrior directly. "We are guests in this place currently. And I do recall you being here for the demonstration of what rude behaviour will get you," notes Vannara with a slow glance towards Yvannus before looking back to the other warrior. "Might I just suggest holding your tongue for a little while longer, before you find yourself worse off than some bruising about the face."
The turquoise twi'lek pauses now, considering as her gaze turns to Eeyla, taking in the rest of the room ever so subtly as she does so. And while the woman remains a mask of calm and graciousness, she is inwardly frowning at herself for allowing the opening that En took. Still it might be a worthwhile opprotunity for others to scout around the station some.
Indigo eyes now turn to En and Anon a moment. "And where, since it looks like we will be your escort, is your destination in the station. Since we know so little about it, curiousity easily overwhelms, I'm sure you understand." Then Vannara turns her courtesan smile to Eeyla and bows her head. "I would never ask you to part with your own warriors, Councilor. A map of the portions of the station and perhaps their pitfalls is all we need." The woman's gaze then falls on Kar and becomes something more sincere. "I would never ask someone to step away from where they have vowed their duty is."

"A great deal of usefulness can be found in silence too." Quietly spoken from his place next to Ben, Tanis's words are not out of character in the least, given how little he speaks as it is.

Yvanus fakes a pout as he looks at Vannara, prominently displaying his bruised bottom lip. Folding his arms across his chest, he returns his attention to Ssurk with a quirked eyebrow.
"You are commander of the guard around here, what is your assessment? Too many guns may make things unnecessarily tense. But with the unexpected nature of this arrival, a little extra insurance may be called for. Me, well I've yet to meet a fly a force pike couldn't solve."
The mandalorian smirks, crinkling the imperial crest tattoo covering half his face. He rises from his seat, more steady on his feet this time, and crosses to recover his rifle and await the decision.

Ssurk deliberates for a moment.
'I will trust you to make your own judgement on whether your presence will be beneficial. In turn, trust that no citizen of Gilded Gage will take responsibility if you do anything stupid. Prove you have sense and a survival instinct, one way or the other.'
'Sink or swim, hm?' En asks, amused. 'Perhaps I too can play that game. Come! Eat up, we must be prepared when the Imperials arrive. They cannot abide by sloppiness, it will make you seem easier targets.'
Eelya nods, one of her headtails slipping from her shoulder until she replaces it.
'Our guest is correct. Grorrl, Kristi, Ssurk, we must prepare. Anyone who wants to should join us outside Oorok's bar in ten.'
The council members leave in haste, leaving En, Anon, Kar, and the rebel party. The Twi'lek rises to his feet.

Instead, the twi'lek woman bows her head in a nod to Kar as she steps away from the table, having not touched any of the food that was served. "Would you please walk me part of the way back to my quarters, I still am uncertain of the way, then I will let you return to your duties, Kar," she says very faintly.

Unsure of what to do next Isshkazza checks his bowcaster making sure it is loaded and ready he then rechecks the rest of his gear and finishes his meal.

Kar hesitates momentarily, then nods. He turns smartly and leaves the cateen, trusting Vannara to follow.
En follows both twi'leks with his gaze, grinning.
'Well that one certainly knows how to manipulate a man. You should take lessons, dear.' He comments, amused, glancing aside at Anon.
The hooded woman simply shrugs.
'Very well.' En adds dryly. 'Who is coming to meet the Imperial delegation?'

"I suppose I will if you need help." Ben looks at his friends. "Figure it is the least I can do to help out." Ben finishes his caf and food then gets up and waits for En to lead the way.

Still unsure Isshkazza follows in behind En bowcaster close at hand. Isshkazza only looks back once to see if the others are following as well, then lets out a growl of agreement.

"Sense *and* survival instinct? And at the same time, no less. This deserves further contemplation."
Yvanus slings his sniper rifle over one shoulder and his field ruck over the other as he nods to En.
"I think this will be a grand lesson for my burgeoning diplomatic abilities. I'm in."

The Council waits at Oorok's when the group arrive. Kar walks along the corridor scant seconds later, expression hard. Eelya nods as everyone assembles and the given time limit is up.
'Come.' She says, turning and leading the group to the door at which Fil sits, looking slightly nervous, fingers twitching with excess energy.
'It is the council's wish that we meet them outside, Fil.' Kristi explains, and the young man opens the door to allow everyone through. Of the council, only Eelya looks perfectly content with the arrangement.
Five minutes later everyone is assembled as neatly as possible in the corridor beyond, and around the corner comes the Imperial delegation. At the front walk six stormtroopers, their white armour polished to gleaming. Behind them, two stormtroopers in black armour with gold striping the arms and highlighting features of the armour and helmets. This pair flank two officers - the first, a reedy hawk-faced man in the garb and rank insignia of a Naval Lieutenant. Next to him, and far more imposing, is a muscular individual in a white uniform with bullion epaulettes but no visible rank insignia.
As he approaches, it becomes apparent that this latter man's straw-blonde hair is beginning to fade to grey around the temples, and lines are beginning to show on his features. The lieutenant, by contrast, is still fairly youthful, the dark hair under his cap vibrant.
Eelya waits until the ten of them have reached the greeting party and stopped before speaking. She addresses the man in the white uniform, and he in turn sets his stony gaze upon the Twi'lek.
'Welcome to Gilded Cage, Grand Admiral. To what do we owe this visit?'
