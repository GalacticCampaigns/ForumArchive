# OOC: Banter away

### **thkaal** (2013-02-27 23:37:22)

Feel free to post here anything interesting you might want to see, or questions, or chit chat between the players to plan stuff ahead of time.

### **Alicia** (2013-02-27 23:41:31)

Yay.. A place to banter without having to go to the casting call!
Glad to have ya aboard, Arelius!

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-28 02:38:56)

Good to see everyone we have on board.
I feel I'm really going to enjoy this game even if the pace is different from what I'm used too. Bonus is I can work on my descriptive story telling some.
Let me know though if I over step at any time. Still a n00b at PbP gaming <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)

Thanks. Yea novice pbp player here as well.

### **Alicia** (2013-02-28 09:56:39)

Here's s bit of advice I don't think I can stress enough... Don't write your post on the forum... I can't tell you how many people, myself included have at one point or another have lost their post because at some point during writing the board decided it was going to time out. Very frustrating to say the least.
Also, if you use a word processor you have something assisting you in spell check.. And I say assist as in the end the writer will be the judge as to whether everything is right, not the computer.
So another bit, write your post, leave it for ten minutes or so while you do something else and reread it. It becomes a great time to add things you perhaps feel make a great addition!
That's the great thing about pbp. You have the time to really focus on who the character is and their development. I was talking to thkaal last night and we both seem to be taking the approach of treating this like a cooperative book, where each post is an addition to a Chapter.
Hopefully I didn't get to preachy there, but definitely take the advice to not use the forum to write. I don't want to have to say "I told you so". <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Sounds like sound advice to me. Hopefully most of my story posts I'll be able to do from pc instead of mobile. The post I made last night was from mobile and was difficult but not impossible to edit correctly

I use gdocs from my tablet and phone, which is nice since it cross syncs to each other and to my computer. Also never know when a customer shows up so the auto-save is a boon.

Hrm. Hey boss, what model ship is it? Light/Medium Freighter, shuttle? Just wondering before I finish my post. I understand its an older model that has missed a few maintenance cycles, just trying to get a feel for layout and design.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-02 17:10:20)

With GMs permission I believe this would be a reasonable ship to use if a Freighter is to be used, [XS-800 light freighter](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110217133543/starwars/images/f/f0/XS800schematic-SS.png "http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110217133543/starwars/images/f/f0/XS800schematic-SS.png") ![XS800.png](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20051127142131/starwars/images/e/ef/XS800.png)
It isn't really that big or fast. Designed just before the Battle of Yavin it could be considered a ship that was used as payment, or traded back and forth over the years. Can be piloted by 1 but preferred to have Pilot and Co-Pilot. Roomy enough to hold up to 8 people, including crew, along with up to 115 metric tons of cargo between the two cargo bays.
Being it is about 25 years old it definitely would have a few quirks, and since maintenance was described as have being an issue it probably would need some hull work along with minor to moderate repairs to some of the basic systems to bring them to 100%. What does everyone think?
*************
Looked through the different core source books and I only can find it on page 76 of the D6 Unofficial Source - Starship Stats. Not sure of the difference between D6 and D20 at the moment so not sure of conversion to Saga rule set or I would scratch together a sample stat block for it.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-06 15:07:33)

Ryder.. You know you don't have to wait for me to post, right?
I'll hopefully get mine up today. Work and life has been a b**** last few days.
The ship looks fine to me (though that's GM discretion), and I might actually be able to convert the stats from d6 if you send it over.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-06 15:11:54)

That is why I haven't posted yet. Waiting on confirmation about ship. I could be generic with the post but that just seems lazy to me. I have a rough draft of what I want to post, but alot of it depends on ship model.
I'll see about sending you a copy of the d6 stats I found when I get back to home pc.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-07 00:28:32)

Did have a question regarding ship stats. Certain things depend on character manning a station. Now I may just not be reading the book right or it could be the cold I've been fighting the last week, but is character (pilot) level added to ship reflex or is it just character level?

ItÂ´s the level of the pilot

I'm beginning to wonder if something happened to our GM. Haven't seen a post from him here for several days

I haven't seen him on messenger for awhile, so now I'm really hoping he's alright. <!-- s:(( -->![:((](https://i.ibb.co/8n0X9m5N/icon-cry.gif)<!-- s:(( -->

Same here. Hope to hear from him soon.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-13 11:39:41)

Hope my last post wasn't too wordy. Good to see our GM back. Now to see how the other characters begin to fit into the story <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)

And touch down...if you can call it a landing lol. Star Chariot sure makes an entrance.

### **thkaal** (2013-03-20 12:56:19)

Sorry I've been neglecting this. I've been the mule during my sister's move and my parents have had me helping the neighbor's with yard work. I would much rather have a real job. Any way, I've been so exhausted (as you should be able to tell by the value of the posts) that I haven't had much focus on the game. Things are beginning to settle down (and school is fixing some issues so that it's more in line with the skills of the students) that I should be able to actually put in the projected time I wanted when I first posted the game.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-20 13:21:48)

Cool to hear. I was beginning to wonder if everything was all right boss.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-23 22:59:32)

Going to wait for your post Alicia before I post and give greeting to you and your master <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-26 15:55:55)

Did the game stall out?

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-26 17:48:36)

This is why you don't wait for others to post.
I'll try and have something out tonight.

Well wasn't sure about your actions yet and part of the post I drafted up kinda depends on them <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)
Nothing but love though!

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-28 19:16:45)

Just a reminder. This ship doesn't have a boarding ramp. Just an access hatch and drop down ladder located on hull behind bridge. It does however have loading lifts for each cargo bay, but Ryder hasn't checked or used either yet.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-28 21:21:36)

Access hatch, boarding ramp. Potato, tomato

The roll was to see if he could gleen any information past just the destination. I know unlikely against a trained mind of a Jedi master.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-03 18:32:54)

Just to let you guys know I will be starting a military class on Monday and will be focusing my attention on that. I will still monitor the threads but my posting frequency may slow down. Will only be 3 weeks though.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-03 23:13:04)

Thanks for the heads up!

I get the feeling that plate has significance beyond Ryder's current comprehension...

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-06 10:48:17)

Been over a week since last post. Hope everything is going okay for everyone

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-26 14:24:59)

I was sort of discussing with Thkaal today the possibility of maybe running the game live once or every other week using roll20 or ORPG, whichever program Thkaal wants to use.
Now I'm mostly free on Sundays with either Monday or Tuesday off after that. He's Pacific Timezone and I'm eastern so that already makes things a little challenging on our end. What sort of availability do you have Ryder and are you interested in doing live sessions?

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-26 14:40:20)

I cuurently have a game um in on Roll20 that runs every Sunday during 1700-0000 PDT. Not sure I could do another virtual tabletop. Really depends on how much time he wants to devote to each session, during the week may be an issue.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-26 15:04:25)

I've been spending Sundays at my boyfriends chilling. Pretty much free all day and I'm very eager to be getting into a live game. Leave it down to Thkaal then as to when he'd want to run, and you to if you want to play in double features. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-26 15:22:36)

The game I'm currently in just had a spot open up due to RL interference. Pretty sure your more than welcome. Was advertised on Roll20.
Called "Birth of the Republic" hosted by Chamomile if your interested or want to take a look.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-26 16:02:02)

Ah ya. Saw that. Only it says his game starts at 10pm my time which makes it run way later than I can play every other week.
Not to mention I've probably missed his cutoff for applications.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-26 16:21:27)

Not sure if the spot has been filled yet. Time might be adjusted too since the person we lost was in Australia.
Guess we'll just see.

---

### **thkaal** (2013-05-26 18:35:53)

Okay, how about sundays, noon to 4, pacific time?
On roll d20?

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-26 18:42:01)

That's 3-7 for me. Agreeable on my end

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-27 14:57:36)

Doesn't conflict with anything I'm already set for and is early enough. I think I could do that.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-27 19:54:54)

Is it just me or has the forums become awfully quiet the past few weeks

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-27 21:19:42)

It's not just you. Not sure what's going on.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-29 21:12:06)

Those last couple posts threw me a bit. An interesting twist. I'm hoping I read into well enough that my post isn't completely off base of where you were going with that Boss. Interested to see how the Imperial is connected to Ryder and why.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-03 08:41:50)

I found the time spent on Roll20 was well worth it. A great time and good story was told. The chapter 1 ending and cliff hanger was a trip. Can't wait for chapter 2!

---

### **thkaal** (2013-06-03 17:03:22)

Tanks. I really do try to get some interesting plot development. Just enough of a twist to keep things motivated and interesting, without diverging too far from the Campbellian standard.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-06-09 12:08:26)

I've got company down from out of town today. I won't be able to make the Roll20 time. Sorry.
