For additional character of the ship I figured a few quirks would help define it.
1st: Engine stalling. Engines will stall sometimes on startup and sometimes during heavy acceleration maneuvers. Requires a DC 15 Mechanics check to restart as a full round action. I'll leave it to GM for how often this might happen. Figure this could be because of faulty fuel injectors or regulators in main drive. Could be fixed with overhaul of the engine, time and parts would be determining factor along with appropriate DC Mechanics check.
2nd: Random System Standby/Shutdown. Sometimes a system will take longer than normal to start up OR sometimes a system will shutdown or switch to standby during use. Systems affected; Shields, Communications, Navigation Computer, Weapons (individually). Requires a DC 15 Mechanics check to bring system back online. Cause is primary power wiring harness through ship is weakened causing safeties to kick in during power draw. Could be repaired if time is taken to replace/repair primary power wiring.
3rd: Consistent Lean to port when landed. Ship will always lean due to weakened landing support hydraulics. Can be adjusted but will return. To repair a replacement for both port struts must be installed.
