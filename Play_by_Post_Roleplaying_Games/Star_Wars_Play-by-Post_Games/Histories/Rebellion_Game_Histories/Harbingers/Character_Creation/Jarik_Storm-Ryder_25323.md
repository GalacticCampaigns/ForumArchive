**Background**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Grew up as the son of traders Xavier Ryder and Kiera Storm with his younger sister Elisa Storm-Ryder on the *Eliall*-class cargo barge *Blue Horizon*. At age 14 the ship was attacked and boarded by space lane pirates. In the confusion of the attack one of the other crew members on board managed to hide themselves, Ryder, and one other in a shielded compartment hidden in one of the ship's corridors. When they exited the compartment they found the ship heavily damaged and adrift. Everyone else on board had been killed but they could not find his mother or sister and one other female crew member. They feared the worse, capture for sale into slavery. They worked for two weeks trying to repair the hopelessly damaged engines and failing life support. As what was left of the ship's rations and supplies began to run dangerously low they were rescued by another passing freighter which brought them to the nearby Galidraan System where they parted ways. One crew member decided to hire onto another freighter that was passing through while Darin Dymos took charge of Ryder and settled into the world's seedier element.
Over time Ryder discovered an almost natural knack for picking pockets and small time cons. He made a poor living moving from one mark to another before becoming a low level enforcer for a local gang. He quickly became known as the “Good Luck Charm” from his eerie ability to sense danger when in potentially dangerous jobs, which lead to the near mishap one day when he was twenty-one. His boldness and ego had gotten the better of him and he had ignored the feeling he had and was nearly caught in a raid by local officials. He managed to escape off planet and out of the system but the event caused a turning point in his life. He became regretful of the things he had done, and the deception he had pulled on so many for the quick credit. He began to pay attention more closely to the details of the galaxy and how events were turning out for the Empire and the Rebellion. News of multiple Death Stars burned him to the core, and a hatred began to grow for the Empire.
Moving from odd job to odd job, system to system, he turned his focus now on making an honest credit and looking for his lost loved ones. With little skills under his belt, except for a gift for gab and an near sixth sense ability to detect danger, he found little information towards his mother and sister, or the pirates that had abducted them. The time difference was just too great, and too far from memory in the local systems. He decided he would begin saving in an attempt to purchase his own ship legally and follow in his parents footsteps and hope for better opportunities. When the time was right, he began to think, he would find a way to secretly assist the rebellion, hopefully before it failed completely if he was to believe the Imperial Propaganda that was being spread through every holo-news network.
