**Level:** 1 (Extra levels can be earned for a well written background up to level 7. An estimate would be at least two hundred words in the background per level. This is not a guarantee. Submit Level 1 character sheet with story and then I'll tell you additional levels.)
**Build:** 30 points
**Hit Points:** Level 1 is maximum. Full hit points per level.
**Start Wealth:** 1000c per level.
**Used Books:** All
**Custom Races:** If you wish to run an original race, you must have a write up for the world, the culture, as well as a history comparable to a country's entry in the Encyclopedia Britannic. (Yes, I'm saying you must earn it.)
***Additional Notes***
**Infinities Setting:** This is a setting based on a possible extrapolation based on "something" happening differently between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.
**Custom Classes:** Certain "classes" are mentioned in the timeline. These are not true classes, but are names of those with certain abilities and interests. A list of the minimum requirements will be provided for those seeking entrance into the "class."
**Technological Advances:** Rebellion era vehicles are considered Archaic. Personal equipment of the Rebellion Era is also 50% off and -4 to all stats when compared to modern equipment (ie. an archaic blaster firing against modern armor is -4 to damage).
**Hybrid Game:** The game will be played on the forum for the roleplaying portion. However, mission combat will be played on OpenRPG. (This means we'll schedule it ahead of time).
**Post Frequency:** I will be checking the board on M-W-F.
