For the past several weeks, I have been having issues with a particular class. Multiplayer Network Programming...or whatever it was called. Finals were due last night and I turned everything in. I can now once more focus truly on the game and will try to be more post worthy on M-W-F as promised.
For those interested...I got an A in the course and am still on track for summa cum laude.

No problem. Good to hear, family and education come first!
Gratz!
