# Chapter I: The Kindled Flame

### **thkaal** (2013-02-25 23:06:10)

News had come from afar that Master Leia Solo had returned with her husband after long lost. The celebrations were subdued in honor of the leader of the council who refused to partake of them. The Mada-Hessian alliance seemed to grow stronger now, especially with the plans being made to bring the Ovrath-nir into the alliance. This is great undertaking considering the Ovrath-nir had become xenophobic and now would only talk to strangers through an intermediary.
Master Lerrare sat beside the stove, cooking what grubs she could find while out in the desert with her padawan, Rhianna. The Fosh was meditating, on what Rhianna could not know, but when Lerrare went into the dessert, it was usually important to take care of her biological needs when necessary. Finally, she opened her eyes after four days of meditative cooking.
"We are going to Haspeth. There is something there we need. From there, we will have many things to worry about. And worry we shall. You are going with me to work on a very important mission. A great healing needs to be done, and it seems you are the one to do it."

It was easy for Jarik to get the job. Too easy one might say. He was not to play guard, but actual errand boy. Quite literally, a servant. It was demeaning work, but when the pay meant a possible ship, then it was probably worth it. Of course, that didn't mean he'd get it. Only that a ship was possible. But when a Median made an offer, it was always honest. The only question, was he going to accept the job offered by the blue-scaled Median before him, or would he walk away from a ship?

The girl’s fingers trace over the sculpted images of a countryside the visage only interrupted by the well placed structure of a vheh’yaim, the traditional hut-like fortress of the Mandalorians where she was born. It wasn’t like she was homesick or anything, but it was in times of solitude when her Fosh mentor went off in her own meditative word that she found herself thinking of the lush land and her family who called it home. Probably because the desert outside her door seemed so void of life in comparison, and, well, she was hungry.
Rhianna had gone out a couple times on her own in search of a decent meal and restoring their stock of water, but without wandering too far from the hut there was little to find. The meditative trance helped to relieve the need, however, it was in such close communion with the Force Rhian found the visions which had plagued her as a child would come unbidden. Even though Larrere’s instructions had helped Rhian get control over the visions, there were times when the Force seemed to insist.
Drawing back to herself as Larrere breaks the silence, she lets the beskar plate rest on her thighs. The Fosh healer’s announcement was hardly surprising for at times Larrere got impressions through the Force as to where her skills were most needed. What surprises the girl the most is the proclamation she herself was to perform the ‘great healing’.
“**Hapseth, Master?**” Rhian remarks incredulously, doubts over her own abilities as a healer coming to the surface. Her skills were sufficient for a assisting the Fosh healer, but she had no illusions she could equal her master.

After many nights and weeks without a honest income, having to rely on intuition and luck gambling at cards, the offer made by the Median brought hopes to his mind. The downside as he asked for more information was what he would be doing to earn those credits. He wasn't found of the idea entirely but he had recently been in a dry spell of quality paying jobs, and even once or twice the thought of old techniques had crossed his mind to get him by.
He finally settled on a decision to agree to the Median's terms for employment and made his way through the seedy part of the spaceport he currently was making his temporary home back to the cheap room he was renting. There was little for him to pack, just a couple changes of clothes, his father's blaster, and a data pad with old pictures of his family and life before the pirate attack. He adjusted his holster under his left arm and latched the blaster into place, easily covered by the worn loose fitting jacket then slipped the data pad into an inside pocket on the right side of the jacket. Throwing his small bag over his left shoulder he left the room and made his way back through the spaceport to the prearranged meeting place with the Median if he choose to accept the job.
*"Finally,"* he thought as he passed the various species either living or working nearby. *"This might finally be the turning point I needed. Hopefully it isn't too dull, but I must be careful what I wish for, been getting this odd pit in my stomach, something different than usual, ever since I met that blue scaled man."*

"Yes. Hapseth. It is a world .... we know very little about. You will find it useful. As will I. Imagine, you will be the envoy of the Alliance to a world that only hears tatters of information and provides even less. There is no ignorance. We must rid you of the ignorance you have of this world. Mine as well. I too am ignorant. But I have sought far and wide, searching and have found one thing. You will be far more important than I on this journey." The Fosh nodded, feathers bristling for a brief moment before she plucked a grub to savor its tastiness.
She looked askance at her padawan, already searching for the telltale glimmers of pride. Oh no, those will not do. Not do at all.
"You will not be healing a person. Nor will you be healing a people. You will be healing a rift. And the way you heal a rift is with words and ideas. Everything harmed needs healing."
* * * * * * * * * * * *
The linen robed figure stepped towards the mercenary. The blue scales glinting in the sunlight, large yellow which normally would have been unnerving gave an aura of calm serenity. He gestured towards the ship, "Your star chariot awaits."
The vessel was nothing special. Hell, it was obvious that the maintenance schedule could use an overhaul before the ship could be considered...a ship. But, the Medians did have a reputation for honesty, and rarely took pay relying instead on donations of those grateful to have had their service.
"Please run through your inspection and let me know if there is anything I can do to make it more to your expertise."
Another trait of the Medians, careful wording. It was easily seen during the negotiation.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-06 23:13:07)

Taking a seat next to her Fosh master, Rhianna looks sideways at her and then too takes a grub out of the pot. Popping it into her mouth she considers Larrere’s words. *Healing a rift between people?* she wonders, putting together the master healer’s words together in some form of coherency. The fact the world itself was relatively explored would have been enough to pique the young padawan’s interest. Add in her master’s portent of the adventure to come and she all but forgets her hunger.
“**When will we leave, Master?**” she asks with the unbridled excitement of the young; completely ignoring her master's admonishing looks.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-07 00:21:06)

Ryder paused a moment as he looked past the Median at the ship that sat on the landing pad. *Star Chariot, I kinda like that*. At first he didn't recognize the model of the ship, but almost instantly recognized the Corellian manufacturing. The ship, although much smaller in comparison, resembled a well known ship used widely throughout the galaxy, the CR-90 Corellian Corvette. He could definitely tell the ship had seen better years, pits of rust were beginning to form on the hull in various spots from extended periods parked planet side. The ship even seemed to have a lean to it's port side, a fault most likely in the landing gear stabilizers and easily corrected, although it gave it a unique character.
He nodded towards the Median as he let his bag slip from his shoulder as he began to walk past. **“Aye that I will. She looks like she was once a good ship, and most likely still is.”** He slowly made his way under the the horizontal barrel like bridge between the forward landing legs to the extended ladder, dropped from the belly of the ship. After a few quick steps up the ladder he found himself in the primary corridor, reasonably clean with a thin layer of dust on the deck, with the bridge directly behind him and crew quarters lining the bulkheads. He first decided he would take a gander at the engineering area at the back of the ship. *No point at looking at anything else in this ship if there is an issue with the main drives.*
He was pleasantly surprised when he passed into the common room and found it had some of the more pleasant additions for long trips, a holographic Dejarik table to the port side, and what looked like a recently stocked medical bay on the starboard side. Passing through he found himself in the engineering section and at first look couldn't see anything out of place. Although everything had a decent amount of grunge built up on it, it all looked operational. With a smile that parted his face ear to ear he made his way back through the ship to the bridge. On the bridge he found it to be more spacious than he originally anticipated. In the center was a wrap around console with all the various controls or the ship and two very comfortable pilot's seats. On the starboard side another smaller console contained the extended sensors and communications suite, while on the opposite side was a small console for a shield operator should the ship ever be in a situation where someone needed to monitor the shields constantly. He stepped up to the pilot's chair and slid down into it and leaned back for a moment, getting a feel for the ship around him.
*Now lets see how this baby purrs.* He thought to himself as he leaned forward and begin toggling the appropriate switches to power up the main drive and ship's systems. The engines stalled for several moments, as if it was having a fuel issue, but sprung to life with a fury. The vibrations of the main drives vibrated through the ship's hull as it rolled over and smoothed out, giving him a feeling of goosebumps as he heard them, and felt them through his seat. He cycled through several of the ship's systems finding no issues with any of them, except the occasional lag time before the system powered up. Pleased with everything he powered the ship back down and listened to it go quiet and waited a few moments before making his way back out of the ship to stand before the Median.
**”She is a fine ship, a little old, a lot of character, but a fine ship. Nothing some good 'ol fashioned TLC won't cure.”** He said with maybe a bit to much volume, and a smile as big as his face. Ryder's tone changed to something a bit more serious as he began to extend his hand as customary in sealing a contract. **”Now, I believe in exchange you had something very particular you wanted me to do?”**

"We shall be leaving soon enough. A ship is on it's way to us. One of the Medians is soliciting a pilot for us."
Lerrare had used the word "Median." Normally, they were all referred to Jedi to each other. However, this word suggested there was something different that was happening. Perhaps a level of secrecy that was expected. Obviously they were going to be diplomats, and the Jedi were known as Medians because of their peaceful mediation between various people. The Master's feathers rose and fell slightly, suggestive of amusement at her padawan's eagerness to adventure.
"Rhianna, what is the goal of a Jedi as compared to that of a Median?"
*** *** *** *** *** ***
The Median nodded, arms folded into sleeves crossed against his chest.
"Yes. We request that you pick up a Median and her apprentice on Toran-na. The beacon is already signalling and the ship is set to find the frequency. Simply go to Toran-na and follow the beacon." The Median flipped a switch to receive the beacon signal but nothing came up. They were in the wrong system after all. Then the Median headed towards the hatch.
"When the mission is completed, you will be given the title to the vessel. Until such time, the Medians will be keeping an eye on the ship." With that, the Median was gone.
A few moments later, the ship seemed to have an odd noise coming from the engine.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-12 23:17:07)

Ryder took a moment to let what the Median said sink in, *His own ship.* A few questions popped to mind though; How long would the mission last? Was it a simple pick up and drop off? No couldn't be that easy. That odd feeling in the pit of his stomach swelled a bit more, was it anticipation or something he had relied on for years trying to warn him, he couldn't tell. Nevertheless he made his way through the ship, ensuring the Median had deboarded and making sure the ship was ready to take off. Finding no sign of the Median, or what was causing the strangely odd noise mixed in with the sound of the engines he made his way for the bridge and took his seat.
Toggling the repulsors the ship lifted slightly as it got lighter against the planet's gravity. He increased the power and began maneuvering it towards the sky, once the ship gained enough altitude he engaged the sublight drives and made for space. As the ship passed through the atmosphere he set it's course and began plugging his destination into the navigation computer, letting it compute the hyper jump. *Toran-na, I can't say I've ever been there.* Thought of the passengers came to mind as the navigation computer beeped, signaling it's computations were complete. *Two passengers, another Median and her apprentice. That word, apprentice, was he speaking of Jedi? No, couldn't be. They were scattered, the rebellion they had helped for so long near defeated, or was he believing the Imperial propaganda too much? Either way,* he thought as he engaged the hyperdrive and watched the distant stars stretch to streaks as the ship lurched into hyperspace, *they are going to need one or two of the cabins, might as well tidy them up a bit before I get there.*
With the ship essentially under auto pilot, as it sped through space, he made his way off the bridge and entered the first port side cabin he came too. It was reasonably clean, minus the thin layer of dust on everything. It wasn't big by any means, but spacious enough to contain a fixed bed along the port bulkhead and a personal desk on the aft bulkhead. A small storage locker was slid up underneath the bed. Definitely not luxurious by any means, but it was something he could call home, finally. He found the rest of the cabins set up in a similar fashion and began dusting them down, preparing them for his soon to be passengers, and the mystery that surrounded them.
Some time later he heard the alert alarm go off, signaling the ship was closing in on it's destination. He moved quickly to the bridge and took his seat, watching the count down on the navigation computer he timed dropping out of hyperspace almost perfectly. As the stars shrank back to distant pin points he heard the sensors ping with the beacon the Median spoke of. *Well, time to follow the signal.* He brought the ship around and began making his way into the planet's atmosphere, following the signal, hearing it get closer as the sensor's kept ringing out a louder and louder ping. Below the cloud line now he could see a desert tundra spread out before him, the beacon somewhere ahead in the middle of it. Odd for someone to be all the way out here, unless, they didn't want to be found in the first place by accident. He slowed the ship down when he could see small structure ahead, the signal apparently originating at or near it. He brought it to a hover fifty or so meters from the small structure and brought the ship down as softly as he could, the ship decided it would shut down it's repulsors just as the landing struts touched ground, but before they had fully taken the weight of the ship. The result was a rather rough thud, that almost tossed him from the pilot's seat, as the ship dropped dead onto it's landing struts, straining them, and immediately leaning to port as it settled out, the sounds of stressed metal echoed somewhere deep inside the ship.
**"That did NOT go as I had planned,"** he said in frustration as he sat back and took a breath. He shutdown the engines and sat for a moment peering through the viewport to the front of the ship. At first he couldn't see much from the dust he had kicked up bringing the ship down, but as it thinned he could see the building again. **"Well, time to go meet who I'm picking up."** He smiled as he stood from the chair and made his way back to the entrance hatch. Before opening it he checked his holster to make sure it was still in place, and not obviously showing, then pressed the switch and watched it slide to one side and the ladder descend until it made a dull clank against the ground below. He skipped every other step on the way down, and turned to face the building once he was down. Straightening his worn jacket he made his way out from under the bridge of the ship and stood a few meters in front of it, the dust was still settling, but visibility was increasing. He placed his hands on his hips as he continued to look around, while letting his face grow into the most friendly smile he could muster.

### **Alicia** (2013-03-13 22:21:23)

Rhianna looks sideways at her mentor, becoming sober at the query. Lerrare was always putting her on the spot like this, and was undaunted by it. The question brought the girl’s thoughts to the lightaber she carried.
Passed down over the years it had become something of an heirloom. Once it had belonged to a Jedi Master, her grandmother’s teacher, who had died during the war leading up to the Emperor's reign. He had engraved the mantra of the Jedi into its hilt, the words worn by use, but still visible.
Mentally, Rhianna’s fingers trace over the patterns of the words. There were five tenets in the code which expressed the goals of a Jedi: be guardians of peace, protect and defend, respect life, serve others, and improve oneself with knowledge and training. The Medians had started as mediators and problem solvers, their role not much more than that of a diplomat. The name Median had become an alias for the Jedi, one that hadn’t immediately aroused the Emperor's attention. However, the common people didn’t know with certainty the Medians and Jedi were one and the same.
The sound of an approaching ship breaks Rhain away from her contemplations and she moves quickly to the door to look out. Distorted by the cloud of dust picked up with the compensating thrusters of the ship, she watches as it makes an awkward landing. She was used to traveling on tramp freighters in various states of disrepair, but this one looked like it had spent some time in the junkyard. *Hopefully, it looks better on the inside*.
Turning back around to Lerrare’s waiting gaze, she realizes there was still her master’s question to answer. “**A Jedi’s goal compared to a Median’s is to serve the Force.**”

---

### **thkaal** (2013-03-20 14:07:21)

Lerrare's eyes seemed to whirl from her apprentice's answer. Pushing herself up with a groan and stretching her back with an arch, she seemed to suddenly age twenty years just from her posture. A dried root staff in hand, she walked towards the door and patted Rhianna's shoulder. Shaking her head, there was amused disappointment in the strange way her beak seemed to smile.
"Oh, to be young and full of misconceptions. That is why you are still an apprentice."
The Fosh pulled her robes around her feathered body, muting the colors with the plain pale linen. She hobbled towards the ship through the hanging dust, leaning heavily upon the staff as if her entire weight was resting on the stout wood. A hand raised in greeting towards the ship. Then a motion to Rhianna to collect the two bags of clothing, one of which was a little heavier on the bottom.
Within the cabin of the vessel, a blue indicator light blinked twice in urgency, then dimmed to lifelessness. A rattling of the landing gear caused a voiceless groan from the skeleton of the vessel, an audible indicator of the ship's distrust of anything involving gravity. Hisses and the plinking of droplets of liquid hitting metal pipes. He could also see a bird woman approach from a hut with a young attractive human woman at the door way of the hut. He could also just make out her called question to the apparent apprentice.
"Rhianna, what is the purpose of a Median?"

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-03-28 11:51:54)

As the last of the dust settled Ryder could see two people emerge from the small hut. First was an aging Fosh moving slowly supporting her weight on her staff, following behind was a much younger female carring a couple bags. He lifted his right hand in greeting then gestured towards the ship behind him.
**"Greetings. Im Captain Jarik Ryder, the *Star Chariot* awaits. I believe you are my passengers since you are the only people for several kilometers around here."** He paused a moment as he took a few steps closer. **"I'm not sure what your destination is but we can get you there. Young lady, can I help you with your bags and show each of you to your cabins?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2013-03-28 18:51:58)

Rhianna frowns at her master’s retreating from as the Fosh pats her shoulder at heads out to greet the ship. Perhaps it was going to be the discussion for a future lesson, but if her answer was incorrect how could she hope to answer the next one. Did she want the purpose that the Medians put forth to the rest of the galaxy or as Jedi what they hoped to achieve? By the fact her master had referenced them as Medians earlier, Lerrare perhaps didn’t want their Captain to know quite yet. The young girl felt cheated for a moment by the question. How could she answer after all if her master wanted to keep things quiet.
All this goes through her mind as she collects their meager belongings, and after tossing the bes’kar metal plate into her bag slings it over her shoulder. She wasn’t in the habit of leaving anything behind as she never knew when they’d be returning. With few possessions to begin with their nomadic lifestyle was hardly difficult on that end. They kept only that which they could take with them and weren’t willing to leave behind. However, Rhianna probably wouldn’t be very happy to leave behind the plate if she had the choice.
Taking her place beside her master, she grasps the extra bag with both hands as she looks over the ship once more and the captain as he descends the ramp. She knows Lerrare won’t be very happy with her for not answering, but not knowing what she was allowed to talk about in front of the new arrival she decides silence was the best option.
With a shake of her head she turns down the captain’s offer of help. “**No thank you, Captian,**” she says shyly, remembering her manners. “**I can manage them.**”

*Interesting. A spirited and independent young lady. This should be an interesting trip.* He nods to the young lady and gestures back to the ladder dropped from the belly of the ship just behind the bridge. **"If you follow me I can show you each your cabin during our trip. The ship may not look like much but she's space worthy."** As he turned to start towards the ladder to show them aboard he paused and looked over his shoulder in mid step. **"If I may ask, where are we headed and should I expecting any sort of trouble?"**

Lerrare walked aboard the ship saying, "Hapseth. And one should always expect trouble, but not be ruled by it. Awareness does not mean subservience." The Fosh then looked at Rhianna, still seeming to expect an answer front her apprentice on the before mentioned question. There was no encouragement in the Fosh's eyes except to give an answer. Even a wrong one would be acceptable for such answers tell as much as correct answers.
"Dear Rhianna. Do you not understand why we are travelling?"

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-01 18:29:18)

Ryder paused a moment listening awkwardly to the conversation between the two before pointing out the two cabins on the starboard side of the ship.
**"Although small they should provide some privacy during our trip. You can find refreshers towards the aft of the ship at the end of this corridor in the common area. Feel free to make yourselves at home."**
He began to turn away towards the small bridge of the aging freighter then spoke over his shoulder, musing on what the Fosh had said. **"Ma'am I'm always expecting trouble, I was just wondering how much trouble you might be expecting."** With a smile on his face he quickly moved through the hatch into the bridge. Shortly afterwards he could be heard whistling a common tune as the ship began powering up.

### **Alicia** (2013-04-01 22:28:25)

Rhianna follows respectfully behind her master, gazing about the ship absently as the captain leads them toward their cabins. It would be nice to have a room to herself for a change.
Such thoughts are pushed aside as Lerrare brings her back to the question.
“**We’re going to learn and to help them,**” she says with little hesitation. It was a simplified response to what she knew they would be doing, and yet there was much she didn’t know about what their purpose was on the planet. *Heal a rift? Between a people, maybe?* To her it became likely they were going to become ambassadors of the fledgling alliance. Of course, there was very little point in making assumptions, she would just have to wait till they got their.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-03 11:50:54)

The ship vibrated slightly as the engines rumbled to life. As the repulsors engaged the ship's hull creaked as it disagreed with the planet's gravity, shortly followed by the landing struts locking into place with a loud mettalic thud as the ship gained altitude. Over the ship's internal comm Ryder's voice sounded a bit distorted, **"Well we're off. Next stop Haspeth. Y'all might want to hold onto something, gets a little bumping passing through the atmosphere into space. You're welcome to join me on the bridge."**
He toggled the internal comm off and keyed up the navigation computer for the coordinates to Haspeth. After a few moments he was able to begin plotting in the course, after he fought the ship as it struggled through the final layer of atmosphere.

Lerrare shook her head and chuckled. "Find your quarters and seek the answers. Just remember, it helps to understand the question. Of course," she turned to face Rhianna. "Digging too deeply into the question blinds you to the question." The Fosh then went to her cabin and sat on the floor and began to meditate. She allowed her awareness to follow Rhianna, sensing the young woman's emotions so that she can later guide the girl.
The ship lurched up as Ryder flew her up and away. There was some mild turbulence, but nothing that the ship couldn't handle. The ride was slow and languid. There wasn't much to do aboard ship. The nav computer claimed the trip would take two days.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-04 18:58:59)

Ryder pushed forward the hyperdrive lever and watched the distant stars stretch as the ship jumped to hyperspace. Toggling the alarm and a few other systems on the control panel he got up from the pilot's chair and headed out of the bridge. He paused briefly as he passed each of the occupied cabins glancing inside at his passengers then continued to the common area and began rummaging through the storage lockers and cabinets seeing what the ship was stocked with.

---

### **thkaal** (2013-04-07 15:17:22)

The lockers contained four rebreather masks, some emptied powered cells, various droid parts and a gold plate with an etching of two humans, some circles and triangles in a row.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-07 15:35:33)

Satisfied he had found nothing of immediate value he made a mental note of where everything was and decided to brew some fresh caf for himself and his passengers and put together a small meal from the ship's pantry.
The aroma of the caf slowly filled the main cabins of the ship along with the meal he had scrounged together with the limited supplies currently stocked on the ship. He made another mental note to restock once he had a chance and poured himself some of the caf then took a seat to enjoy the meal.
He continued to muse over some of what he had seen in his passengers, their actions and words and began to wonder. Where these two Jedi as he had read about or were the similarities just coincidence. Could he just by happen stance been in the right place and time to see an old thought and plan come to fruition? Only time would tell, but his interest in the two had definitely peaked.

### **thkaal** (2013-04-12 15:25:14)

Time passed relatively uneventfully. Relatively being the operative word.
During one late meal, Lerrare was out and eating with Rhianna by her side. The feathered Median's eyes whirled with an apparent agitation. She ate slowly, teasing some food onto a single digit which was brought to her mouth. The colors of her feathers seemed to spark in the artificial light. She also seemed to eye their escort with an awareness that tugged and pushed at him. Finally, she turned to Rhianna, seemingly dissatisfied with the girl's lack of answer.
"Medians are in the middle. Always in the middle. We look at both sides. Find why they are similar, and show the sides that they need each other."

---

### **Alicia** (2013-04-14 22:26:51)

Rhianna has spent the trip thus far in the freshly dusted compartment designated as quarters. While the size hardly bothers the young girls sensibilities, she finds the noise of the ship’s engines is quite distracting. Meditation had been a key component to her training with Lerrare. Teaching control of the visions that had come to her unbidden ever since she could remember. Seeking a better answer to her master’s questions she tries to work through where she had gone wrong. *Need to understand the question and not dig too deeply/*, but her thoughts just seemed to leave her even more confused.
The wafting smell of the caf, distracts her mind completely and the grumbling of her stomach brings her out of the room. She’s pleased to see the simple, but edible meal set out by the captain. Lerrare’s agitated presence is a full reminder of how she’s failed to discover an adequate answer. Her close relationship with the Fosh only serves to deepen the emotions. Head downcast, she eats with slow deliberation which stops with the Fosh’s lecturing chastisement.
*Peacekeepers.* The answer had been in front of her all along and her mouth forms in a small O in response. “**Master… do you know who we’ll be ‘in the middle’ of on Haspeth?**”

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-04-14 22:47:36)

Taking another sip of his caf while seated off to the side looking at a small data-pad, Ryder could feel an odd sensation he soon came to realize was the watchful eyes of the Fosh. He listened to the short exchange of words between the two, seeing the position of master and apprentice. The topic caught his attention, and peaked his interest. *Medians, and her description fit how Jedi were seen through history from everything I've read. These two most certainly have to be Jedi. How to broach the subject, without getting too nosy or pushing my luck?*
Realizing his cup had grown cold and near empty he stood from his spot and passed the Fosh and young girl to refill his cup. **"Sounds like you are expecting a little trouble. Anything, other than flying you there, I might be able to help with?"** He spoke loudly, and confidently, as he stood near where they were seated sipping is caf. His jacket was open, clearly showing that his concealed holster was not being worn, at some point between moving around on the ship and making the meal he had removed it and stashed it somewhere. **"I may not be the fastest with my blaster, but I'm quick with my words, something I picked up a few years ago running the streets."**

Lerrare looked towards Rhyder. The sensation of a smile seemed to play across her beak, but that might only have been the infectious nature of her merriment. She beckoned for both to move closer. Sitting quote matronly, she seemed to be gathering her thoughts. After a moment's quiet contemplation, she took another morsel and consumed it. Taking a deep breath, she began:
"The middle path is always dangerous. No one wishes to look within the mirror unless they already bring to it that which they will see. For many, this is grooming and preening. They are prepared for the ugliness they see but will change it for they have control over it. However, when you look into the mirror that is another person, you have no control over the image. You are forced to face the image looking back at you as it truly is.
"The medians are the shroud over the mirror, slowly falling to the ground so that the image can be adjusted to slowly. It is in this that the medians find their place.
"Do we expect trouble? Why should we not when we know the truth? Do we expect recompense? Yes, but that is the success of our endeavors."
She took another morsel and turned her gaze to Rhianna. She reached out, caressing her student's cheek.
"There are two factions on Haspeth. Those who open doors and those who close them. Our purpose is to show them the way to accept both. The door can be opened and closed at the same time. But the factions do not matter so much as the people within them. Factions are made up of people who share a common ideal. But even disparate factions must be able to communicate, so in that they have common ground."

Ryder scratched his chin for several moments while he pondered the response then took a long sip of his caf before setting down his cup.
**"I offer my services then, other than just your transportation. Needa fast talker? I'm your man. Need some digging done on someone? I can do that too."** He boldly stated with his hands on his hips, a smile as warm and wide as a a star spread a crossed his face.

The Vosh’s taloned caress was gentle and acts as a reminder of their close bond. Under Lerrare’s tutelage for almost half of her life, the Vosh had become like a foster mother to the young girl.
Of course, the affection was followed by a lesson, one which Rhianna listens to attentively as she finishes up the meal. The coming mission was going to be an important one after all. Lerrare had already declared that it was Rhian’s task to mend the rift; a daunting task for the young girl.
As Ryder declares his services, Rhian looks up at him. It was unusual for their transporter to do so. While they were normally curious about what their passengers, they normally were superstitious folk and followed the rule of not being accountable if they didn’t know anything. The Empire, after all, could be quite ruthless.
“**That’s quite… generous of you, Captain,**” Rhianna says in her soft, shy-like voice.

Getting the impression his announcement was a bit of a surprise he smirks and does an over embellished bow with a flourish of his hands. **"A pleasure to serve."** After standing back upright he collected is cup of caf and finished off the cooling beverage and placed it on the counter next to the dispenser before straightening his tunic nodding to the two and heading out of the lounge to check up on things on the bridge.

### **thkaal** (2013-05-06 16:42:35)

The feathered master made no comment nor showed any expression at Ryder's offer. If anything, Lerrare appeared to have considered his speech a mere formality. She eyed him with aged serenity, the gaze of a grandmother rejuvenated by the playful antics of her youthful grandchildren. When Ryder had gone, she let her gaze fall on Rhianna. Rising from her seat, she motioned for Rhianna to follow.
Once in Lerrare's quarters, she closed and sealed the door. She took a deep breath, holding it from what seemed an eternity. Finally, she released it and turned to her charge.
"I had hoped to spare you this day for a few more years, but it seems that you are at a crossroads. I have never been a teacher, merely a guide on your journey. You told me where you wished to go and I took you on one of the paths I knew. However, it seems the Force has decided it is time for you to choose the next path."
Lerrare made a motion towards the bed for Rhianna to have a seat.
"I know you do not fully understand the meaning of my words within the context they are said, but open yourself to the changes within you, the changes around you. There is a path that I cannot choose for you, it must be chosen freely."
The Vosh's eyes whirled with amusement at her own memories.
"Of course, you can delay the choice for a while, but in the end, that too will be considered a choice."
Meanwhile.....
The sensors on the bridge immediately went wild like the Hispesia Festival on Nalpone. Lights and alarms declaring an immediate threat as the ship was rudely ripped from hyperspace in the middle of nowhere.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-06 18:45:10)

Rocked off his feet by the unplanned and violent removal from hyperspace Ryder climbed into the pilots seat and activated the shields then fought to bring control back to the ship while viewing the sensor screen in his periphial.
**"SITH SPIT!"** He remarked out loud as the ship leveled out.
He quickly toggled the alarms off and did a quick check of the ship's status verifying everything was still in working order. *Too far out to have been a planetary gravity well, unless the calculations were off. Must be an interdIctor out there, and close. Never a good thing when those are employed. This could get interesting.*  Toggling the ship wide com he spoke quickly as he continued to bring the ship around. **"Sorry for the rough ride, it looks like we may have company. Still waiting for the sensors to show whatever pulled us from hyperspace. You might want to come up here."**

Following solemnly behind her master as the Fosh led the way to her quarters. Shifting from one foot to another, the only sign of her youthful impatience, Rhianna waits for her mentor to voice what was apparently troubling the elderly healer.
Taking the indicated seat, the young girl tried not to seem confused as she listened attentively.
"**This choice… is part of what's to come on Haspeth?**" she asks, trying to find some clarification from her mentor. Her thoughts are, however, interrupted by Ryder's message as the ship drops out of hyperspace. This was perhaps becoming one of the most eventful journeys yet. "**I can go check it out, Master,**" the young girl says as she jumps up from her perch on the edge of the bed.
Her curiosity doesn't allow her to wait for her master's reply as she heads for the cockpit to see what the fuss was.

The Foss watched as her apprentice left the room. Action without thought was all well and good, but there was no need to rush. She simply closed her eyes and shook her head while she waited for Rhianna's return. "No, my daughter. The choice is now."
On the bridge, sensors showed a not just an Interdictor, but a Star Destroyer as well. Several wings of TIE Stalkers, similar to TIE Interceptors but with more rounded solar fins, buzzed through the sector. The comm beeped on, apparently overriden.
"Unidentified vessel, this is the Imperial vessel Purifier. Cut all power, lower screens and prepare for tractor beam. Your vessel will be searched and any contraband confiscated."

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-10 19:22:39)

A feeling of dread is instilled in the young girl as she enters the cockpit as he receives the message. This was just what they needed. There was no point in asking if they could outrun the small fleet. Was more likely they'd be shot out of the sky at the first sign of their engines powering, and Force knew how many shots the ship could withstand.
"**Unless you have an alternative, we should cooperate,** " Rhianna says, the words coming out with some distaste. If the Force was with them they would get out of this alive, and hopefully unscathed.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-10 19:47:46)

Ryder sighs deeply as the message comes through the comms. Toggling a switch he deactivates the remote override and mutes the mic as Rhianna enters behind speaking. He turns slightly to look over his shoulder, **"I take it they're not friends of yours. I was just about to get your opinion on the matter, but I think I agree. With that interdictor running we have no chance of getting out of here in one piece. What's your plan, I'm not fond of Imperial detainment."**
As he waited for response he brought the ship to a slow halt and let the engines drop to an idle. He then toggled a few switches and the ship seemed to power down, most of her systems dropping to standby status.

---

### **thkaal** (2013-05-11 19:18:13)

The ship jerked as one of the Imperial class Star Destroyers locked a tractor beam and pulled them in. Though it was not the most pleasant of rides, there was great care taken to keep the ship intact. Each jolt was countered by an additional beam that held the ship together. The voice of the officer from the Star Destroyer was soft, smooth and reassuring. The gender seemed feminine, but not so much so that it couldn't have been a young ensign.
As the ship came to a rest in the larger vessel's hangar, the Foss appeared on the bridge, twisting near Rhianna. The look in her eyes seemed strangely apologetic, yet it seemed that she was apologizing for something else besides this. She patted Rhianna's shoulders and nodded before heading back to the gaming table.
"There is no need to make a fuss about something that has not happened. Merely be aware of the situation and act as necessary."

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-11 21:24:10)

Ryder took in a deep breath as the ship settled in the hanger bay of the Imperial Ship. Unbuckling the pilot seat harness he stood and adjusted his jacket and watched the Fosh leave the bridge. He took a moment and decided he should grab his pistol from his quarters and stash it in the common area before popping open the access hatch and lowering the boarding ladder.
After shuffling quickly through the ship to his room then the common area where the Fosh was seated waiting he returned to the main corridor and opened the boarding hatch and released the ladder then stood back with his hands on his hips, putting the largest and friendliest smile he could muster and awaited the Imperial inspection team, unarmed.
In the pit of his stomach a knot grew, danger was near. One false step or poor wording of a statement could end things badly here. Pushing his pessimism to the side he tried to focus on the moment and mentally crossed his fingers for luck.

### **Alicia** (2013-05-11 22:44:22)

Rhianna follows her mentor into the common area, their recent conversation, the apologetic look and their imminent danger leaving the young girl on edge. The only contraband she had was the lightsaber stowed away in her pack in her room. While it was likely they would be able to identify it, she could just as easily deny knowledge of what it was. After all the activation switch is internal, it could just be a curiosity from her travels. Taking her master's advice on not fretting on what hasn't happened yet, she tries to find some calm as she starts up the gaming table, the holographic game pieces coming to life. Idley she moves them about, playing against herself to waste the time and ease her nerves.
As Ryder goes to open the hatch she takes note of the blaster he's hidden, though being a pacifist by nature doubts she'd find herself having need of it. There were other weapons in her arsenal. Many less lethal.

Time passed.
It seemed like an hour, but it was merely ten minutes. Troopers could be heard at the entrance forming an honor guard outside. Minutes later, a woman in a deck officer's uniform made her way into the ship. She glanced at Ryder and lifted a brow. She checked her data module and nodded. Looking up, he would see electric blue eyes that fell easily into a pale robin's egg blue. A memory surged within him, something he couldn't place, but there was certainly a sense of familiarity that could not be explained. Her skin, pale as a dust moon, glowed under the internal lighting of the ship. Her figure easily perceived from within the cut of her uniform, she was truly a beauty. However, her stern expression gave her an ugliness that only a truly interested man would bother to work past.
"You are the captain? Where are your passengers? I'd like to talk to them."

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-16 23:19:58)

He looked over the female officer, stunned by the beauty, but quickly brushed it aside as a feeling of familiarity crossed his thoughts. Unable to place why right away he decided to leave the matter to later and focused his attention to the question at hand
**"Yes, I'm Captain Ryder of the Star Chariot. My only passengers are sitting in the common area. May I inquire to the reason of this little meet and great?"**
He gestured with his hand slightly towards the aft of the ship as he spoke, never letting his eyes off the officer, though he tried to glance at the data pad display anytime its screen angled far enough for him to see it without trying to seem obvious in the process.

---

### **thkaal** (2013-05-17 19:55:22)

Lerrare patted her charge's shoulder, listening to the exchange. She had the calm from being well aware of what was going on and possible intent. She gave Rhianna's shoulder a reassuring squeeze, listening to the conversation.
The officer started to move towards the aft, the pad clasped under her arm. She walked stiffly as though every step was an exercise in rigid discipline. Oddly, none of the troopers had followed her, each remained outside as they had been ordered to do. When she saw the Foss and the human, she nodded curtly.
"These are your passengers?" She handed the pad towards Rhianna. "Your thumb print, please." She looked quickly towards the Foss, calculating the best way to get her identity checked. "I believe you will have to come with me so that we can ascertain your identity. It shouldn't take more than thirty minutes. If everything passes, you will be allowed to go about your business without further interruption."
Lerrare nodded and stood, straightening her robe. "As you wish. I do hope that you will find this as educational as I."
The officer suddenly stiffened. Slowly, the woman nodded respectfully and motioned for Lerrare to head off the ship which she did saying, "Stay here, Rhianna. We'll be fine."

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-17 22:32:18)

Rhianna finds some reassurance in her mentor's demeanor and tries to emulate the calm Lerrare is exhibiting. Taking the pad from the deck officer, she does as she's told before handing it back. The young girl nods glumly as her Foss mentor is lead off the ship for her identification. When they had gone she turns back to the game she had been playing. "**Trip was going so well,**" she comments sourly to no one in particular. There was always a risk when they met up with the Imperial authorities. Not only because of their anti-alien prejudices, but if they had been marked as Medians.
"**Was bound to happen sooner rather than later, I guess,**" Rhian directs toward Ryder.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-17 23:28:00)

Watches as the imperial officer for the most part ignores his question and then leads the Fosh off the ship. He leans up against the bulkhead near the gaming table where Rhianna was seated thinking more on the officer, his gut twisting a bit more when he realized she was speaking to him. Snapping back he looked over at her with a raised eyebrow.
**"What? Getting picked up by Imperials or being seperated?"**
He tried to get his demeanor light but the woman was tugging at the back of his mind, the unexplained familiarity, along with the interest in his passengers. He began to believe that he had stumbled upon Jedi by happen chance and was assisting in some way that he didn't fully comprehend yet.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-18 10:44:04)

Rhianna looks sideways at Ryder as she realizes he's distracted. "Being picked up by the Imperials. I always worry when we're stopped by a patrol. There's always the chance they want a nonhuman to make an example of... Course some don't care for human Mandalorians either." The last is remarked almost as an after thought.
Concentrating for a moment she moves one of the holographic pieces only to have it clobbered by another. The game board dies.
Leaning her elbow on the table, she let's her chin rest on her fist. Her gaze follows the path Lerrare would have taken to leave.

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-20 20:34:07)

He smirks slightly at her comment, **"You make it sound as if this happens often."** He mulls over his thoughts a moment, still thinking of the officer, and being aware of the nasty pit in his stomachs that was twisting his insides then put his hands on his hips and looked at Rhianna.
**"Mandalorian eh? Wouldn't have taken you as such. I would have been more inclined to say,"** he paused a moment and spoke a bit softer, to prevent any eavesdropping. **"A Jedi, though you have referred to yourselves as Medians. Though I haven't seen the iconic symbol of the order your actions and words remind me much of what I've read and heard of the Jedi."**
He paused another moment looking at her, and her posture before turning and heading over to the caf pot and pouring himself a cup.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-23 17:01:26)

Rhianna doesn't rise to the bait of being called a Jedi, however she does give the captain a sidelong gaze for a moment before looking back toward where she can sense her master.
"Medians come from all walks. We know when we're with another, though many use the name to define what they do. It doesn't particularly matter to us what we're called."
Her gaze takes on a far away look for a long moment as if she's recalling something.
"I'd be careful what sort of... opinions you voice. You never know who might be listening, " she warns.

Rydee nods slightly as he takes a long sip of his caf, the beverage cooler than he had expected then looked at Rhianna while leaning against the small counter. **"Appologies if I offended. My curiosity gets the better of me sometimes. So in the past these stops have turned out for the better I assume, since you two are still around."**
He turned his head towards the corridor leading to the boarding hatch and seemed distant a few moments as if deep in thought but made no further comment on the subject, deciding to wait for the next turn of events.

---

### **thkaal** (2013-05-25 20:19:31)

Rhianna's focus was rewarded with a pleasant, almost happy, "Not now, dear." The Foss was being escorted into a room under heavy guard. Once in, Rhianna would see, just for a moment, tea being offered to the Foss. There were no guards in the room. The officer bowed respectfully to the Foss and began, "Master...." A feathered hand was raised and another, "Not now, dear," was sent to Rhianna and she was suddenly blocked from seeing what transpired next. "You have someone else to entertain. This is my path, follow your own."

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-26 17:01:54)

It’s with a renewed sense of childish eagerness that Rhianna turns back to Ryder. With confirmation that Lerrare was being treated well, her initial unease disappears. Moving to retrieve a beverage for herself. “**You didn’t offend me. I sometimes get carried away with my own feelings. We each have our own failings.**” Taking a cooled glass of water she sips the life sustaining liquid. “**Maybe some other time Lerrare and I can sate your curiosity.**”
Cocking her head with her own curiosity she realizes how little she knows about their captain. “**I’m guessing you’ve never has the fortune of an Imperial visit?**” she asks with some sarcasm.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-26 17:18:44)

Ryder takes a long sip of his cooled caf before smirking slightly and setting his cup down and looking at Rhianna closely. **"I can't say it is the first time I've had a unscheduled meeting with Imperials but this is the first time I've been boarded while flying this ship."** He laughs as if making a bad joke, trying not to let on that this is his first run with the ship since he got it. **"Though I get the distinct feeling that things are looking good here, something still tells me, a deep gut instinct if you will, that something is wrong. Just a little off."** He pauses a moment and stares at the floor before taking a few steps around the common area as if pacing then looks back at Rhianna. **"What I can't figure out is why or how I know that woman. Seems familiar to me but can't place why and it's really beginning to bug me."** He pauses again while looking at her, as if she would be able to job his memory then realized the folly in that thought, turned and paced the common area a bit more, stopping briefly to grab his cup and refresh it with some more caf.
He paced as if he was deep in thought but anxious about being held on board an Imperial Star Destroyer, and impatient about having to wait. He finally decided that maybe he should at least enjoy the company he had instead of wearing himself out over things he couldn't necessarily control. He took a seat at the small gaming table and toggled it to life and motioned for Rhianna to join him.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-26 17:45:07)

Rhianna doesn't comment as he continues to attempt to hide his own distress. Glad he finally admits to what's bother him, she takes a seat at the station she just vacated and looks over the game board. After contemplating the board she makes her move. "**Lerrare has taught me that the answers we think are difficult to find are usually the ones that are right in front of us, the easiest to answer. Maybe if you stopped trying to force the answer to come it will come naturally?**"

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-27 15:04:53)

Ryder listens to Rhianna after she takes a seat and contemplates his next move. **"My life before being a Captain was much different. I am used to having a plan, knowing possible dangers, and for the most part knowing who or what I'm dealing with."**
He makes his move without a hesitation once he has a good look at the game board, his piece making a blocking move but not coming under immediate danger from any of her pieces. **"Situations like this put me on edge, but I see the wisdom in what your saying."**

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-28 16:44:02)

Rhianna is quiet as she contemplates her move and her words. Seeing him take a defensive stance on the game board she opts for a more seemingly aggressive one as she takes out an unimportant pawn. "**Plans are all well and good, but I find a planned life is rather boring. Not to mention plans look better on paper than they do when put into action.**"

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-28 16:54:57)

Ryder watches her move and wonders about her tactics, somewhat aggressive but didn't leave anything important vulnerable. He contemplates his move while responding to her. **"There is always a point where even the best laid plans and contingencies can go wrong, but running blind I have found can be quite disaterous. Its why I like to know when and where I'm going and who I might encounter along the way."**
Deciding to maintain a defensive stance with the move Rhianna made he moves a piece that keeps his vital pieces protected but provides an easy capture for Rhianna should she choose to move one of her vital pieces.
*Mandalorian. Aggressive and eager to prove thier worth in battle. But Jedi as well, much more collected and tactful. Should be an interesting game.*

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-28 18:04:14)

"**I bet *they* weren't part of any plan you had,**" she quips conversationally. It isn’t hard to guess who ‘they’ is. Rhianna’s move comes with little hesitation as she continues to attack the secondary pieces. Taking a sip of her water, her gaze wanders to the access hatch before her attention returns to Ryder’s move.
“**I wonder how long they plan on keeping us waiting like this.**” The question comes out more rhetorically, since she’s not expecting her companion to know the answer.

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-28 18:26:12)

As the pieces begin to exchange hands he sees many of his pawns are gone, his options becoming thinner. With mostly only the more vital pieces about he changes his strategy to a passive aggressive position, trying to lure Rhianna into giving up her vital pieces as she continues her attack, still keeping the most vital protected but tempting to go after.
**"You definetly know what your doing, thinning the ranks giving less options to play. Time will tell if its effective."**
He tried to goad her a little, knowing it probably would do little good but the game was giving him an insight to her mindset. Something that would be useful if he truly planned to work with her in the future. Where he took calculated risks she made much bolder moves.

---

### **thkaal** (2013-05-28 20:11:27)

Finally, the officer and Lerarre returned. The Foss seemed unharmed, she didn't even seem the slightest bit upset. She made her way towards her charge and their pilot with the inspection officer right behind her. Still, no guards followed them. The Foss turned and bowed towards the officer, "Thank you for your hospitality. I had never suspected Imperial officers could be so inventive when it came to their techniques in questioning suspects. I have learned much." The woman merely stared at the Foss as the bird-like woman spoke.
The officer turned towards Ryder, her eyes coldly stared at him. The connection was still there. It seemed to have grown stronger. Without realizing it, her right hand came to her stomach and her fingers slowly spread. An almost imperceptible shudder passed through the officer's body before she smartly turned on her heel and existed the ship. As she left, Ryder could feel a pull, a tug on him as though his very life was slipping from his chest and then the "cord" snapped and the sensation was gone.
Lerarre, for her part, merely watched the exchange. She seemed to see the flow between them and made no effort to hide that she had seen something deeply personal and private between the two humans.
"A quite delightful young woman, Captain. I wouldn't be surprised if you saw her again."

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-28 20:48:24)

Standing as he heard someone entering the ship Ryder hit the pause button for the table and the holographic pieces disappeared. He watched the Fosh bow then felt an odd sensation he couldn't quite describe and noticed the officer staring at him briefly before turning and heading off the ship. The event left him disoriented a moment as he tried to place what had just happened.
In a jokingly way he spoke up, trying to brush off the incident for now. **"Well can't say I've ever had that effect on a woman before."** He turned to the Fosh and nodded briefly. **"I take it everything went well. Anything we should know?"**

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-28 22:32:08)

Even though her vision had showed her Lerrare was being treated fairly, Rhianna can’t deny she feels relief at her master’s return. Standing she moves to stand beside the Fosh watching the inspector carefully for any sign of any trouble.
Glancing between Ryder and the woman during their final moments, Rhian doesn't miss that something was going on though she doesn’t know what exactly it means. With a frown, the girl watches the inspectors retreating form. Her attention is drawn back to her master and Ryder with the joke at his own expense.
Seemingly more at ease with the Inspector off the ship, she resumes her seat at the game table. Her senses however are open for anyone boarding the ship.

---

### **thkaal** (2013-05-29 15:11:20)

"We are to go about our business. You will find that we are free to go in a moment." She made a bow to Ryder before heading off towards her quarters. She beckoned for Rhianna to follow her.
"You will find that the Medians are everywhere, Rhianna. Always and forever be on the look out for us. Now, tell me about your talk with our dashing captain."
A signal was coming from the comm, "You may disembark. Exit with vector thirty-two alpha then continue your vector towards your destination. Message repeats."

---

### **Ryder2101** (2013-05-29 15:26:25)

Ryder nodded to the Fosh and watched them head down the corridor then followed behind to head for the cockpit as he head the comms squak.
Taking his seat he clicked over the mic long enough to give a confirmation of reciept of the message and brought the ship to life and began takeoff procedures. The length of the vessel prevented him from turning it in the bay without hitting something else docked so he backed it out before making an about face and putting the ship back on course. Once confirming the intradictor field was down he put the ship back into hyperspace, set the alarm, then leaned back in the pilots seat and closed his eyes.
He began going over the events that had happened and reviewed what he had learned and talked about, letting it all soak in and process slowly in his semi conscious state.

---

### **Alicia** (2013-05-29 16:39:43)

Rhianna nods to Ryder as she follows Lerrare towards her quarters. They would have to finish their game some other time.
Entering the seclusion of her master's room she considers the Fosh's question for a moment; taking note of her master's description of their captain.
"We didn't talk about much of importance..." she starts. "He did express that he knew our inspector somehow and not being able to tell from where distressed him." With the matter on her mind, she asks "Who was she, Master? Was she our Median ally?"

The ship shot through the space above and beyond normal space. Ryder's mind began to wander. Somewhere, some distant time ago, that officer was in his life. But she wasn't an officer. Nor was she really in his life. She seemed to actually be his life. But then, as his mind moved from image to image, they weren't instances of his past, they were instances of dreams long forgotten. Hazy images fluttering through his mind, giving him a security that youth crave in times of turmoil.
In the quarters of the Foss, the wizened master spoke, "She is a friend. One I aided long ago. She had a dream life that was far too complex for her to understand. Our young captain is similarly afflicted. Even now, he is with her and she with him. But do not worry. Your path is still clear."

As his mind played through the memories of dreams of long past Ryder did not immediately understand them. Confusing at first it was hard to piece together the collection of images. He was surprising lucid during the events, though he had no control of the flow. Trying to slow down parts only caused the images to fade and blur away and eventually he just let it come as it flowed.
*Who is she? Who am I? Where is this? Where is that? Have I actually been there before?* These were the questions he parsed to himself as he watched, no, experienced the events. He could recall not only the images but tastes, smells, and even sounds. The familarness and connection to the woman was close, but he still didn't understand completely why. *Were we the same person in some past time, or just that close then? Were we destined to meet again in this life and do something important brought together by some mystical power?*
He struggled to maintain the flow when the images began to fade further away. Eventually the dreams past and he drifted into a deeper sleep, unaccompanied by either memory or thought. His last thought before drifting completely away was, *If they are truly Jedi, or at least experienced in the arts, I should ask them about the dreams and the woman.*

"A dream life? Living visions?" she asks trying to understand what it was her master was referring to. Visions she was all to familiar with. "They're connected through the Force in such a way they share these visions." Looking at Lerrare, her gaze asks for confirmation. "Share a destiny," she further extrapolates. The Force had a way of making things happen and it wouldn't surprise her if Ryder had something he had yet to do. It would be good choice though if he accepted what was in store.
She knows what's going on with Ryder was likely just a distraction from what was to come. The choice she was to make. Apparently their run in with the Imperials did little to stray her from the path. Or choose to take. The whole situation was likely to give the girl a headache if she attempted to figure it all out, so she decides to trust in the Force and take things as the come.

"That tale is for him to tell, not me. He will or he won't, but you are not to pry. I only tell you so that you may keep an eye on him and be ready to understand. Your youth protects you from the challenges and burden of experience, but that protection comes at a cost. Without the experience to handle what is thrown at you, you may not be able to handle it. The difference is in skill and armor. You have the armor, but not the skill. As you grow in skill, the armor is removed." She settled on her bed and closed her eyes. Her breathing sounded shallow for a long moment.
"She is no threat to you, my dearest heart. Your nest is still your own, no matter where you make it."
**** ***** ***** ****
The dream continued for the young captain. He was in her arms, she in his, he was within her, she was within him. Over and over their roles changed. Again and again, they were together, then apart. But it was always death that parted them. There was also a sense of betrayal. She had betrayed him. Or had she? He was certain he had betrayed her, but he didn't know when. They were together and happy. And then one was gone and the other without hope, doomed forever...until they found each other once again.

Waking from his slumber Ryder checked the timer and realized he had only slept a few hours. Rubbing out a kink in his neck he realized the chair wasn't as comfortable as it had looked and stood up. He checked over a few things before heading back off the bridge to the common area to make himself a fresh pot of caf. While waiting he retrieved his father's blaster he had hidden and returned it to his cabin then waited near the pot as it finished brewing.
The images of the strange dream still were in his mind but fading away. The memories were definitely odd for him, hard to understand, but he seemed filled with a sense of purpose he previously didn't have. Now it was a matter of how to broach the subject with his passengers to see if they may have insight, if they were Jedi as he suspected since Rhianna niether confirmed or denied his suspicions when he brought it up earlier.

GM (GM): The ship and crew and passengers were in hyperspace towards Haspeth. Lerrare and Rhianna were having a discussion and Ryder was waking up from a very intimate dream.
Rhianna Bralor was havng a conversation with Lerrare while Ryder was in his dreamstate
Rhianna Bralor lets what Lerrare has told her process for a long moment, the pause while she gets comfortable on the bed drawing it out.
Rhianna Bralor: "I didn't think of it as a threat, Master. I just wanted to learn more about what was happening."
Lerrare: "That's beneficial." She was settling in for a rest when there was that strange smile that never smiled on the Foss's beak. "He needs to speak with you now." She nodded to dismiss her apprentice.
Rhianna Bralor nods at the dismissal, having suspected their conversation was coming to end quite soon. She heads to the common room, knowing he would find her there once he was done in the cockpit. He finds her fiddling with the gameboard when he comes in to make the caf.
Jarik Storm-Ryder contemplates how to approach the subject of his dreams with Rhianna while the pot of caf is brewing, not sure how to bring it up then decides to go with an old standard.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "So visions, realistic dreams of times long past, and a woman I know, but never have met, filled my head while dozing on the bridge."
Jarik Storm-Ryder pauses a moment then looks at Rhianna directly.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "Have you ever experienced something like that?"
Rhianna Bralor blinks at him a moment, surprised he had just come out and asked her for a moment. "Not to the same extent," she admits knocking over a game board purposefully. She didn't like talking about her visions. "Lerrare told me a little, but she knows more than what little she told me."
Jarik Storm-Ryder nods slightly and smirks at her reaction to being so blunt. He checks the pot and finds it still not ready then looks back at Rhianna, his arms folded across his chest.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "When Lerrare came back on board with the female Imperial Officer I felt a very strange connection. It was stranger still when she left, as if part of me was being dragged with her. After gettings us back on track for our destination I took a moment to relax and think on everything and I was flooded with experiences from times past."
"The best I can describe it is as if we were the same person or very close in another life. I can still vaguely remember some of the scents and sounds, but the emotions from the experience are still quite strong."
Jarik Storm-Ryder turns his head slightly and sees that the pot is done brewing and turns completely to pour himself a cup, looking back over and offering her a cup as well.
Rhianna Bralor doesn't say anything for a long moment, taking the cup of caf before she decides to answer. Of course she didn't really have any.
Rhianna Bralor: "Lerrare called it a dream life, but said the other answers would come from you."
Jarik Storm-Ryder takes a few sips of his caf as he begins to pace unconsciously, mulling over her half answer. "A dream life?" He muttered more to himself than anything. After a few rotations of the common area he stopped and looked at Rhianna, his eyes filled with understanding, yet confusion.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "So we are connected, yet we are not. What I choose to do with it is up to me. Sounds like some deep mystical plan from ages past, yet now coming to fruition."
Rhianna Bralor shrugs at his words, taking a sip of her caf.
Rhianna Bralor: "The Force works like that, I've learned to trust it."
Jarik Storm-Ryder smirks slightly at her response then moves to take a seat at the game table. "The Force. Something I've become interested in over the years, that and the stories I've read and heard about Jedi. I've always wonder how much of it is trickery, or mystical powers." Recalling the last game the pieces spring back to life in their last positions. "Shall we finish?"
Rhianna Bralor shakes her head, not in the mood to spoil an interesting game with what they were discussing.
Rhianna Bralor: "People believe what they want, especially when believing the truth can be a death sentence. Better to believe its all tricks."
Jarik Storm-Ryder leans back in the seat, letting one hand slide through some of the holographic pieces before letting it rest in his lap, then cocks his head to one side and lets a genuine smile spread across his face.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "Yes. A death sentence if the wrong people were to find out. I have a feeling, there are no 'wrong' people aboard this ship.
GM (GM): Oddly, it was at that moment that the ship's proximity alarm activated. The ship dropped out of hyperspace, the signal for a reached destination sounded.
Jarik Storm-Ryder glances at his chronometer, shocked so much time had passed and jumped to his feet, knowing the ship would continue traveling in a direct line at near full speed until told otherwise. "Looks like we've arrived." He rushed to the bridge to take his place and make sure the ship wasn't hurtling towards imminent destruction. It can be heard as he jogs off, "I need to adjust that damn alarm to alert me prior to dropout not when we drop out."
Rhianna Bralor glances toward the cockpit.
Rhianna Bralor: "I thought we had another day?"
Rhianna Bralor moves to follow Ryder into the cockpit to get her first look at Hespeth.
Jarik Storm-Ryder takes a seat in the pilots chair and brings the ships speed down while he checks the sensor display and visually scans the space around him through the main viewport
GM (GM): The world, though distant, was clearly visible. It was as though all the land were encrusted in orange amber, but the seas could be considered to be predominantly algae with their blue-green tint. The comm crackled to life as an incoming message came through. The timber was obviously that of a protocol droid. "Welcome to Haspeth, noble and curious seekers of harmony. We welcome you and your. The Red Queen herself commands all visitors to wear the most sacred blue scarves to indicate the unfamiliar nature of rules and customs of the sacred order. This is to ensure your protection. Please, great seekers of harmony, always wear your scarves. Much pain and humility can be spared with this simple requirement. If you are ready to accept this most insignificant of burdens, then you are cleared for landing at the following coordinates."
Rhianna Bralor watches the traffic for a moment. At least they weren't coming to a world that denied visitors. That made things easier.
Jarik Storm-Ryder looks over his shoulder to Rhianna who had followed him in. "Seekers of Harmony? Blue Scarves? Red Queen? Sounds like an interesting place."
Rhianna Bralor: "The best places generally are."
Lerrare: Stepping into the cockpit, the Foss was already wrapping a blue scarf around her throat as well as handing one to her apprentice. She set a third beside Jarik and watched he dance of ships around the planet. "Fractal beauty to its infinitude of happenstance always is lost on the here and now."
Jarik Storm-Ryder sees Lerrare step in bringing the before mentioned scarves and nods then turned back to the controls and toggled the comms with an automated acceptance and began bringing the ship on course to make a landing at the coordinates provided.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "Well, this should be fun. You all might want to take a seat, gets a little bumpy on re-entry through an atmosphere."
but I can swing that quickly if I need too
Rhianna Bralor takes the scarf her master hands her, following suite in putting it on as she takes a seat. Her attention focused on the world growing larger in the viewscreen.
Lerrare: Taking her seat, she strapped herself in and waited.
Jarik Storm-Ryder manages the controls as the ship grew closer to the planet

GM (GM): You land easily enough. The flight control of the world seemed highly advanced making landing almost ridiculously easy. Upon landing at the pad, three hexapodal creatures with a glossy chitin covering approach. As they get closer, it is obvious they aren't your typical bugs. Their mouths, or rather where their mouths should be is a mass of fleshy tentacles and their eyes are yellow with vertical slit pupils. Beneath the chitin could be made out a flesh of scales. One protocol droid was with them and waiting at the gangway.
Rhianna Bralor stops into her room before meeting the others at the access hatch and disembarks.
Jarik Storm-Ryder powers down the ship before standing and affixing the scarf provided then heads to his quarters and straps on his concealed holster under his half sleeve jacket and slides his father's pistol into it. As he heads out and to the access hatch he can be seen buckling a worn utility belt around his waist.
GM (GM): The three Vik'nu stand in an almost equilateral triangle with one of them standing point towards the ladder. The protocol droid standing at the side of the point.
As the Vik'nu speaks, the droid translates.
P-23K:

Jarik Storm-Ryder:

P-23K: "Greetings most worthy of associates. Your vessel has not been officially registered. Will this be one among the stars or shall the universe itself be a blessing upon us?" The droid then translates the floweriness of the language, "Greetings, masters. Your vessel is not in our records. Is this a single trip or will you be making several journeys to Haspeth?
Lerrare: Turning towards her apprentice, "I love their language. It may sound harsh, but it is so suggestive of polite intercourse and artistic demeanor."
Rhianna Bralor is hiding her lightsaber on her person as well.
Rhianna Bralor: Stealth
rolling 1d20 + 1 + 1

Jarik Storm-Ryder smirks and lets out a partial chuckle at Lerrare's comment but stifles himself quickly and focuses on the droid.
Rhianna Bralor nods to her mentor, letting her handle their initial dealings with the locals since she had a better idea on what their purpose here was.
Lerrare: The Foss stepped forward, looking at the point Vik'nu after descending the ladder. "You are thanked with the warmth of teh sun and the blessings of the stars. May our nests be free of the dangers of the undercrawlers. Our journey will see only three stars, but in the future, we may see the night for what it is."
P-23K: Translated this across to the Vik'nu and they seemed to clatter and click with their tentacles waving in a strangely agitated manner. The droid then turned back to Lerrare and spoke as the Vik'nu did. "For the three rises, the Red Queen has determined that four hundred custodians will see to the needs of your star nest." Once more, it was translated into more mundane speech, "The Red Queen has set the price of four hundred credits for docking fees, masters."
Lerrare: Nodding, she hands over the sum to the droid. It seemed a little obvious to her that money was taboo when used as an exchange, but it was a different custom. The droid took the money and stored it in a compartment in the artificial abdomen. Then, a slightly imperceptible smile was curl her beak. It was hard enough for Rhianna to tell when she wasn't trying to hide the smile, but there was an almost giddiness in her that only someone intimately aware of her habits would notice.
GM (GM): ((in other words, rhinna sees it, jarik doesn't))
The Vik'nu, satisfied with the exchange bow as one, turn as one, and then point Vik'nu advances and when he reaches a point to make the triangle equilateral, the other two begin to move in suit.
Jarik Storm-Ryder watched the Vik'nu with passive intent as the droid translated. Although he had gotten around some parts of the galaxy he had not yet encountered an insect species this close. Seeing the exchange of money and the leaving of the Vik'nu he turns to Lerrare and speaks softly with a question.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "A hive mind or individuals?"
Rhianna Bralor watches the exchange with curious interest. The customs here would certainly be interesting to learn.
Lerrare: "Perhaps. Or perhaps a triumverate of bonded individuals. It is most propitious that we are three."
Jarik Storm-Ryder nods in understanding then takes a moment to look around the landing area and takes in what he sees then back at Lerrare and Rhianna.
Jarik Storm-Ryder: "So where too?"
Rhianna Bralor: "I wonder if they deal with currency only when offworlders are involved."
Rhianna Bralor asks as an afterthought to the exchange and the reactions she had observed.
Lerrare: She then began to move, heading towards the main building of the docking area. She shook her head in the way a dog does, her feathers spreading out. Her tone was hushed as she spoke, "Continue as I do, say nothing about it, do not become agitated, but we are being followed."
Rhianna Bralor habitually follows along just behind Lerrare. When she mentions their tail she doesn't react. "Do you know where we're going, Master?" she asks instead.
Jarik Storm-Ryder raises an eyebrow at her comment and nods in response. He followed along her right side a step or two behind her, casually looking around as they walked towards their destination.
Lerrare: There was a slow nod. "Yes. Quite aware. As is our guest. I would not be surprised if we are actually being escorted." She continued on, leading the two into the main office of the docks. The building was a ....large tree. There was no marking of tool use on the wood, but rather it appeared as though the tree had grown into this shape and the Vik'nu merely made use of the coincidence.
GM (GM): Jarik would not actually see their tail, but would catch a shadow here, a shift of an object there. Whoever the tail was was very good. Perhaps only letting it be known they were being followed without actually being seen.
Rhianna Bralor looks about at the strange wonders that the new planet beholds. She would hold her tongue as Lerrare asked and let her questions wait till a more appropriate time
Jarik Storm-Ryder ponders over the interior of the tree, currently being used as a building, his curiosity intrigued but then refocused his attention on where and what they were doing, which he still had little knowledge of but had volunteered to help out with.
Jarik Storm-Ryder turning to Lerrare as they walked through the building he questioned softly, to make it harder from someone distant to hear. "We are here to talk to someone aren't we? Someone possibly important?"
Lerrare: "No," she answered. "We are here to talk to someone definitely important." She glanced to Jarik, her eyes showing amusement at him. "All are important. You must learn to see that. Our captor earlier was quite important. As are the two who had not spoken to us."
She led them further, and then out of the office "building." Looking around, she nodded to herself and then began to walk down a street which seemed to be nothing more than a very intricately woven network of vines pulled tight against one another. After a handful of steps, she stopped.
"Please, the game is complete. You were seen, you have followed. Surely you know who we are and why we are here."
Allison Amberfall: A small, delicate, feminine gasp was heard almost directly behind them. Frozen at having been found out, it was now quite obvious that this child, perhaps tween in years, was reaching for the place Rhianna held her lightsaber.
"Um, I was just ...putting it back?"
Jarik Storm-Ryder snapped his head around to see where the gasp came from when Lerrare spoke, surprised to find such a young girl
Rhianna Bralor attention is drawn to the little girl, not much younger than she is herself and puts her hand over the spot, more disturbed that the lightsaber had been found someone. It was a risk carrying it, but it being the only weapon she felt comfortable carrying felt it suitable. After all only someone trained in the Force could actually activate it.
Jarik Storm-Ryder is about to speak but then muffles himself and crosses his arms across his chest as he watches the girl and glances around the area for anyone else that might have been with her or watching them too closely.
Lerrare: "Of course, dear. Thank you. It is appreciated. But now, could you take us to her?" Lerrare gestured for the girl to lead.
Allison Amberfall: "Um...yeah. She's been wanting to see you. It's...wow. No one has ever seen me before." She started on, walking back wards, obviously well acquainted with the streets of Haspeth, never once stumbling or missing a footing. In a few cases, she seemed to dodge out of the way of a passerby without even paying attention. Her chatter was quite continuous as well. She would talk about the buildings, the people, the vehicles, where to go, where not to go, who to stay away from. It was obvious this was her home and she was proud of it, seedy underbelly and all.
Lerrare: Listened patiently, taking it all in and admiring the girl, interjecting where necessary to have the girl continue on.
Rhianna Bralor listens to Allison as she leads them to their destination, intent on learning what she can about this new place. Never know what small tidbit might become important later on.
Jarik Storm-Ryder listens to the girl as she mostly walks backward as well as others walk forwards. He learns of some of the local area while being amazed by the talent of such a young girl, even if she seems to like the sound of her own voice, something familiar to him.
GM (GM): Soon enough, they were in what amounted to the back alley of a smaller "bush"-like tree. Allison led them through the paths of what could only be described as the poor of the poor. Once in a larger room where there were a band of sick who were laying on cots, Allison chimed in, "They're here. LIke you said."
A woman rose, pale linens as her clothing, hair disshevelled and dirty, crinkled and out of place with streaks of grey. She slowly turned, a burn scar on her right temple had rendered that part of her bald. She finally faced the trio, and the scar running from her left temple, down through her left eye and cheek did not hide the familiarity of her face. It was the same woman from the Interdictor point. The same officer appeared here and Jarik's sense of familiarity was just as strong, if different from the officer.
Jarik Storm-Ryder stands stunned and in shock as the sensation rolls through him, the familiarity, similar to the Officer on the ship, yet different. He is confused how such a connection could be with the images he had experienced and yet be to two different people in the same life time. Maybe his understanding of his dreams were not as accurate as he thought.
