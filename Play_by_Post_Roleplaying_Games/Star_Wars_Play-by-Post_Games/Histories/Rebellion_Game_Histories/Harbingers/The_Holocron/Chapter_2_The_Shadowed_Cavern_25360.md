# Chapter 2: The Shadowed Cavern

The woman with the hard face looked upon the three of the newcomers. Though she was pretty, life had obviously been unkind to her. Her beauty was unmistakably there, but long hidden. It was almost a shame for her to have even been considered attractive. The stern bitterness of her jaw set her defenses firmly in place. Though she spoke to the three, her eyes were intent upon Jarik. A challenge in her eyes, daring him to comment on her appearance.
"You've come. Good. The Vik'nu have been having a wonderful time ignoring the fact we aren't Vik'nu. They've been cutting down food supplies, pay, housing, everything. Then they threaten to remove more when production slows. The only thing they manage to keep maintained is waste removal."
Lerrare would have seen this all without the Force, the Force merely made it a physical manifestation to the Foss. She nodded, a practiced gesture when dealing with humans.
"Their culture seems to be rather unique, but not so much that something cannot be done. How do we contact the representatives?"
The woman turned and walked further through the building. Where the port office had some kind of bioluminescence growing from the walls, this one required lamps and other artificial lighting. The walls themselves seemed to even be rotting.
"There is only one way we know that seems to work. Apparently, I'm regarded as a blue queen. A queen of a foreign land. The standard method of opening negotiations is to destroy something of theirs. This suggests you're a threat that must be dealt with. However, with our working for them, we are considered a subsociety and can be dealt with in anyway they see fit. We are still productive and our productivity outstrips our damage so they keep us around."
Lerrare looked to Rhianna, expecting her to ask the next question.

Ryder began listening intently to the woman once the initial shock and disbelief had passed. He was keenly aware of her stern gaze and at first did not look directly at her. As she continued on and Lerrare commented he couldn't help but find himself staring into her eyes, momentarily feeling connected to the woman and the dream images he had had on the ship.
*How is it possible these two women are so much the same. One only beginning her life while the other is closer to the end, and heavily worn down by the mistreatment of time. She seems to be keenly aware of who I am, but the mission first, my curiosity later.*

Rihanna follows along behind Lerrare and the woman who was obviously in charge, but had failed as of yet to introduce herself. Obviously she felt names were less important than what had to be done.
Aware of her master's meaningful gaze, Rhian speaks up. "What is the work you do for them exactly?"

The battle-hardened woman looked at Rhianna. She gazed intently to the young woman and shook her head. "Obviously, you're a sheltered child. You haven't had to do much real work, have you?" She gestures to an older man, bald and sick from years of some kind of contamination. "This is Borasht. He's been working in the septic mines for ten years gathering their waste for the pharmaceuticals." Then a gesture towards a child, "Irina has been what amounts to a maid in one of their hive complexes. In other words, we do what we can when we can and where we can. A job's a job."
Lerrare continued looking at Rhianna, still waiting for THE question.

Looking between the two Ryder felt the urge to say something but choked it down. Stepping forward, and closer to old woman, and spoke calmly, unusual for his normally boisterous attitude.
"So what you need is more equality of treatment. From what I see your peoples living conditions are very poor, and there are sick everywhere in some form. From what you said though the only way you have gained their attention is through destruction of something they deem important."
He turned to look a Lerrare and Rhianna, ponder a thought then back to the woman.
"I believe the question is how we get their attention without causing lasting damage. What is something that they hold in high standards but wouldn't be truly detrimental to both sides of this situation. Something we can place ourselves at as a third party to arbitrate the issues at hand?"
He looked over his shoulder to the Medians he had traveled with almost as if in approval but being careful not to turn his back to the woman.

Lerrare turned to Ryder and nodded. "Precisely." She then turned towards the woman. She calmly weighed the woman's stature and dedication. "What would they value, consider a challenge, without considering it an outright attack? Obviously, you do not wish to harm yours, but wish to do enough damage that it is not compensated by the efforts of your work, as you stated. Perhaps, one of their transportation facilities?"
"A docking yard? That could work. Let it be known that we're all to be away on that day and just blow it up?" The hard woman nods, glancing to Ryder. Rhianna could sense a sudden change in the woman, a shift in the woman's perceptions about how the anonymous leader viewed Ryder. "It must be hard walking with the dead." She turned and gestured for the trio to follow her.
