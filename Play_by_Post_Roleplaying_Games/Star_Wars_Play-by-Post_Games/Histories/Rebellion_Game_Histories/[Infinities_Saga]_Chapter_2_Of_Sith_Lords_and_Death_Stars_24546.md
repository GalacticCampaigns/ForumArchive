# [Infinities Saga] Chapter 2: Of Sith Lords and Death Stars

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-10 16:07:38)

Raltiir was several days journey from Tatooine, and the Emperor's battlestation was already in orbit above the planet when the *Tempest Blade* arrived, Jado's ship not far behind. With the exception of Galen, none of those approaching had ever seen it before. It was enormous, though that didn't quite do the station justice--it was easily the size of a small moon. Dark gray in color, the sphere carried an ominous feeling with it, as if it was a Corellian sandpanther lying in wait, ready to strike.
After giving clearance, the two ships landed in a docking bay that rivaled the size of some spaceports. A legion of stormtroopers and Tarkin himself were waiting at the bottom of the *Tempest Blade*'s ramp and another squad stood outside Jado's ship.
Tarkin stood stock still, his hands clasped behind his back, waiting for Vader's team to step down.
----------------------------------------------
High above the docking bay floor, Kyle Katarn sat alone in a control booth, watching the proceedings below. It was almost a miracle that he'd found out about it, so shrouded in secrecy was this special ops team. Vader had recently appointed him to join them, and still he'd had these difficulties. Whatever mission they'd just completed, no one was supposed to know about it.
Of course, he couldn't hear anything that was being said--unless everyone down there had been conveniently wearing listening devices, and they weren't. The only way to find out what was going on was to get closer.

Galen didn´t like this. He had expected to be summoned away from Vader´s team, to hear from his master somewhere else. In fact, he had hoped for it. The last time he had been aboard this battlestation had ended in a disaster, and he dreaded the fact of being aboard it at the same time as the Emperor and Vader was there. He was quite surprised that he had been allowed to come here, as his identity was supposed to remain as big a secret as possible.
When the ramp lowered itself, he looked at the rest of the team.
"You go ahead. I expect my master will contact me shortly"

"Well, Vader's hound dogs finally make their appearance. Funny, they look more like Bantha herders than anything from here." Kyle Katarn stood, turning to make his way down to the docking bay and see what his new team had been up to before docking on this metal moon. Before he did, however, he reached out into the Force, something he was still somewhat inexperienced with, and tried to learn what he could about them.

Han strode down the ramp of the *Blade,* wincing inwardly at the pain that still lingered in parts of his body from his burns. Still, he was recovered enough for mission purposes, and the scars were gone.
Approaching Tarkin, he bowed slightly. "Grand Moff Tarkin," he said, "You honor us with this reception. When can we report to Lord Vader?

As the team began to descend from the ramp, Galen drew himself even further into the darkest corners of the ship. There, cross-legged, he settled into a meditative position. Expanding his presence in the Force, he searched for the presence of his masters - both former and present.

As Kyle reaches out with the Force, he senses a figure still aboard the ship. The man is powerful, but it is more raw power than skill. Still, he could be dangerous. And then there was the figure in the Inquisitor's robe, who he couldn't sense at all. As he made his way down to the docking bay, he found the doors sealed and two troops stationed outside each one.
Though Kyle couldn't sense the Inquisitor, the Inquisitor did sense Kyle. He was up near the docking bay control room, but he wasn't staying put. Galen got about the same feeling, but he didn't sense his masters around anywhere. Vader was supposed to be here and maybe the Emperor, but could feel neither one--but maybe they just didn't want to be felt.
Tarkin glanced sideways at Jado, then faced Han full on. His arms were folded across his chest and he didn't look pleased--but then, Tarkin never did. "The Emperor had another mission for Vader and he will be delayed. Rest assured, the Emperor has asked us to start the interrogations without him." His cold eyes turned back on Jado. "Perhaps since you brought an Inquisitor with you, he would like to have the honor?"
*To clarify: Jado senses everyone, Kyle knows about Galen, and Galen knows about Kyle and Jado (of course).*

Galen bent his head a little lower. He could sense neither the presence of the Emperor or Vader, and that was a bad thing in his mind. Most of all, Vader´s absence troubled him. Perhaps the Dark Lord was not about, but he could just as well be evading Galen´s senses, and if that was the case then Galen didn´t want to take any risks. He decided to remain on board the ship for the moment, and await his masters summons.
He did sense two other presences that stood out to him in the Force. One, he guessed, was the young man who had come with them from Tatooine. The one Kenobi had told him to watch carefully. The other one, he had no clue about, but apparently he was moving.
Steadying himself, Galen closed his eyes and expanded his other senses. If anyone came looking for him, he would be ready.

Kyle had to stop himself from instinctively going for his blaster when he sensed the other Force sensitive on board the ship. He had to work even harder to stop himself when the man without a presence in the Force smiled at him. Fortunately, Kyle did stop himself from getting himself killed and even managed to fake a smile back at the Inquisitor.
As he approached the sealed doors into the docking bay, he glanced at the two troopers guarding them. With a quick nod and his friendliest smile, he said, "Excuse me, gentlemen. I believe my presence was requested within, so if you'd be so kind as to open the door..."

Kyle gave the troopers a wide grin, saying, "Thanks." He strode confidently into the room beyond, keeping his friendly smile fixed on his face. "Hello there!" he called to the group in front of him, "I hope I'm not interrupting? Lord Vader told me I was supposed to join up with you guys, but finding you wasn't too easy." Kyle's posture remained relaxed, but mentally he prepared to react in case one of the members of his new team chose to take offense at him. That happened a lot more often than Kyle would've liked.

Tarkin gazes steadily at Kyle, unblinking. Kyle can see the gears spinning, calculating. "I was not aware Vader had assigned someone else to his team. This is most interesting. What is your rank and designation number?" Though it was phrased as a question it was an order, and by the tone of his voice, Kyle could tell he was expecting it to be carried out.

As he left the ship and entered the station, Wedge could not help but give a low whistle. In all his days, he could honestly say he had never seen anything this impressive.
He looked at the gathering of Imperial personel before him, and showing complete indifference to rank or regulation, bluntly asked Tarkin, "Hey, are you guys ready to take these prisoners off our hands?"

Kyle's smile faltered slightly when he heard Tarkin say he hadn't heard of his appointment to the team. Brushing off his surprise, Kyle saluted the Moff and said, "Sergent Kyle Katarn, at your service. Designation #9543243. Sorry to drop by unannounced, I had assumed Lord Vader would've sent word to expect me. If I've come at a bad time, I could leave..."

Han was somewhat amused at Tarkin's reaction, but he hid it under his military bearing. "Lord Vader has been known to keep his own counsel, Sergeant. Probably nothing to worry about." He knew he was probably being too bold speaking that way with Tarkin present, but since when was it a matter of galactic importance if Vader reassigned some sergeant without telling Tarkin?

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-16 15:39:23)

Tarkin put his hand over his chin and turned his gaze downwards, as if he was thinking deeply. "Yes, yes." He looked back up. "Take the prisoners to the detention block. You may begin your interrogations whenever you are ready." With that, he turned and strode from the docking bay, the stormtroopers filing out after him.
Jado felt his pocket buzzing, as his comlink alerts him to a signal from his ship. It was an alert of an incoming transmission on a private frequency.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back inside the *Tempest Blade*, Galen received a transmission, directly from the Emperor himself. "You have done well. I have kept Lord Vader busy for the time being, so that your presence will not be detected. I have a new mission for you. I have sent the Death Star to Ralltiir because it is known to have Rebel sympathies and may provide an effective demonstration of our battlestation's true power. My spies have also determined that an old acquaintance of yours is hiding out there--Rahm Kota. You must find him and destroy him before Vader arrives. I have made arrangements for the Inquisitor to join you--Lord Vader must not meet him, either."

### **zenkatarn** (2010-01-16 15:50:06)

Kyle nodded at Han's comment, saying, "Yeah, right, good point." However, he quickly straightened up, as though catching himself doing something foolish, and saluted, saying, "I mean, uh, yes sir! Thank you, sir!"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-16 17:02:36)

Galens nearly drew a sharp inhale at the words of the Emperor. Kota was here? That he had not anticipated...and it was troubling. But still it didn´t change his plans too much. He only hoped that the Emperor could not sense the rising turmoil of emotions that rose inside of him. After a few moments of slience, he grabbed his comlink.
"Do you want the General killed, mylord? Or should he be brought in for questioning?"
He let his hand fall from his mouth for a few moments, awaiting an answer, but then he raised it again.
"Master, have your spies reported any sightings of my old pilot, Juno Eclipse? If I am to deal with Kota, then perhaps I should take care of anyone who knows my past..."
He hoped the steel tone in his voice was convincing, but he had a hard time saying the words.

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-16 17:35:29)

As Jado answered, he heard the stern, cold voice of Chief Inquisitor Loam Redge. "Report, Skywalker. Is the Jedi dead?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Kill him. He is of no use to me." The Emperor paused, as he listened to Galen's second question. "Eclipse is of no concern to you," he snapped. "Kill the General. If you must use the talents of Vader's team to track him down, then so be it, but I want him dead. He has become too dangerous to the Empire."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Four stormtroopers stood near Han, Kyle, and Wedge, the remainder of the legion that had stood in the docking bay only moments before. "Sirs, where are the prisoners? The Grand Moff requested they be moved immediately."

## Re: Chapter 2: Of Sith Lords and Death Stars

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-16 18:04:31)

He had hoped that Kota and Juno would be together, it would have made things so much easier. But nevertheless, this was an opportunity Galen would not pass up.
"Yes, my master. I do not think they will be needed to find him. He will come to me if I seek him out. And then he will die"
Closing the channel, Galen thought about how he should proceed. It was true as he said, Kota would probably come to him if he called out to him. As far as he knew, the General thought him dead. If he could, he´d avoid taking more use of Vader´s team, as hanging with them put him at a great risk of being discovered by Vader.
He closed his eyes for a moment, and called out in the Force.
*General…where are you?*

Lando lay sprawled out on the holding cell's one cot, his arms folded behind his head. He glanced at the door as it slid open, but didn't otherwise move. "Are we there yet?" It was a stupid question, or a feeble attempt at a joke, because anyone on the ship would have felt them landing several minutes ago.
Kara, meanwhile, paced the cell, he dark red hair falling into her face and obscuring any expression it might have held. She paused as she saw Han standing in the doorway. "Is this it, then?"
Both of them came with the soldiers as they were escorted from the ship, though both seemed resigned to their fates. In all their combined years working for the Empire, neither Han, Kyle, Wedge, nor Jado had seen a Rebel give up so easily. Han, though, caught a glimpse of . . . something on Kara's face. It wasn't quite determination but . . . peace, maybe.
The interrogation room was the standard Imperial torture chamber, with devices designed for drawing the truth out of anyone, such as nerve disruptors and agony inducers. A pair of IT-0's floated soundlessly in the corner. It was not a pleasant room by any definition, and many officers avoided entering it, even those who regularly tortured their prisoners, preferring to end underlings to retrieve any equipment they needed.
*(If you decide to make the most of the tools in the room, please keep it toned down. We don't need to see anyone cutting off limbs, destroying private parts, or the like. Thanks.)*

Kyle looked around the torture room, his pistol (set to stun) still trained on Lando and his companion. "Nice place," he muttered under his breath, looking with barely disguised disdain at the various tools of cruelty spread throughout the room.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-17 16:10:29)

As people began to move away from the ship, Galen left his hiding place, and exited the ship. He felt somewhat bad that he couldn´t do more for Lando, but there really was little he could have done. The man had known the risks involved in fighting the Empire, and had made his choice. Now, a more pressing matter was to find a transport to get down to the surface, to search for Kota. Palpatine had said that the inquisitor should accompany him, perhaps seeking him out first would be a good idea.

Wedge looked about the interogation room, examining the various instruments of pain. He was by no means a sadist, indeed he took no pleasure in pain for pain's sake, but as a warrior he couldn't help but look around and see potential weapons.
Wedge eyed the rebels, never letting their apparent surrender allow him to let down his guard. He stayed close to the door in case they tried something, all the while deciding what would serve him best if something happened.

Lando and Kara both blanched at the mention of Kota's name. Lando turned his gaze on Jado, trying not to betray the sudden thoughts that entered his head. "Who?"
Kara shrugged. "I think they're under the impression that we know more than we do." She casually leaned against a tray of various sharp instruments and idly picked one up. "I'd honestly like to avoid this, though. So, if it helps, he's on Dantooine. The Rebels are on Dantooine."
She grins, then spins in her spot, releasing the injector at the end of her turn. It hit Jado square in the chest, and the injector released its poison. The color immediately drained from Jado's face as the poison did its work. It wasn't designed to kill him--that would make the torture kind of useless, but it was painful. Very painful.
Lando ran across the room and jumped behind an "operating" table. Despite a chorus of rapid gunfire from Han and Wedge, neither of the two Rebels were hit.
*(Surprise round! Han is the only player who can act, and is limited to one action, so Silverback, just add an extra action to your turn this time and I'll work it in. Everyone else can post as normal. I'm assuming Han and Wedge readied actions with their blasters to shoot, so I took them, but they failed to hit. Kyle probably wouldn't shoot them, and Jado's saber wasn't lit, so I didn't make attacks for either.
The poison in Jado does 1d6 stun damage every round (doing 2 in this one) and he's moved -1 persistent step down the condition track this round only Kara also scored a crit when throwing the injector, doing 10 damage, for 12 in all.

The concentric blue rings of Kyle's stun blast snap off the table almost too conveniently--at least no one was paying enough attention to it to notice. Certainly Lando wasn't, as he shouted something about "Imperial Sithspit" as the shot went over his head.
As Kara is lifted into the air, she first clawed at her collar instinctively trying to find some air. As Jado drew near her, his face getting close, she spit in his eye, "Kill me, you karkin' piece of bantha poodoo." The words were meant to be a growl, but they came out, instead, in gasps.
Galen receives no response on his comlink, which was likely unusual from an Inquisitor. As he arrives at the interrogation chamber a few seconds later, he sees why: Jado is holding Kara aloft in the Force, dangling the woman several centimeters off the ground. Wedge is standing between Galen and the others, and Wedge is about to shoot Kara . . . The blaster bolt is set only on stun, though, an envelops the woman in blue light, and she trembles in Jado's grip.
Han's next shot, hits the side of the table, causing a shower of sparks as some device upon it explodes. The second one hits home, and Lando yelps in surprise as the blue shockwave courses over his body. "I don't think so, Solo." At that moment, Lando leaps from behind the table, directly at one of the torture droids. He grabs the controls and turns it on, sending it in Han's direction.
*(That was out of order, but it worked better, and Han's actions weren't affected by anyone else's anyway. Jado did 9 damage to Kara, and Wedge did 12 stun. Han did 25 stun damage to Lando and moving him one step down the condition track. The interrogation droid is two squares from Han. Also, the poison continues to work on Jado, doing 4 damage this round.)

It seemed surprising to Galen that no response came over the comlink, but as he reached the interrogation chamber moments later, he understood why. A little shocked by the scene in front of him, the Sith apprentice waved his hand in a discrete and halting motion towards the droid, trying to block its motor functions. The other hand he placed on Wedge´s arm, as to discourage further shooting.
"That´s enough. You won´t get anything out of corpses, and the Inquisitor won´t be around to pry it from unconscious minds any longer. I think it has been made perfectly clear that any attempt to escape will be fruitless, and Calrissian and his associates will *not* provide any more trouble I think"
As he put emphasis on the last words, Galen looked towards Lando, clearly indicating that violent resistance would indeed be futile, and only bring more pain and suffering. Using the Force to pull the still-embedded injector out of Jado´s chest, he adressed the Inquisitor.
"As for you, I need you to come with me. I have received a new assignment, and it seems you are to be a part of it"
((Technometry +8 (I know it says it should flee from me for 2 rounds, but I´ve never liked such powers, so perhaps just having it stand still will do?). Move Light Object +8))

Deciding that Kara would be taken care of by the Inquisitor, Wedge simply shrugged off Galen's hand and focused his shots towards Lando, who was still a threat.
*((Standard action: Shoot Lando.
Nice and simple.))*

Jado igores her reaction and whispers **"Well you can stay here and enjoy the Moff's *Hospitality*or you can come with me. Perhaps get a chance to help your friends."** Jado turns moving Kara so her back is to him and facing the door. and starts pushing her to the door. **"Galen I think this one can help us on our task."**
I think that works out to

Shaking his head, Galen ignored Kara for the moment.
"We don´t need her. Our mission is of the utmost importance, and haste is required"

Kara laughed bitterly as she stumbled toward Galen. "I've already handed over the location of the Rebel base, laserbrains. What do you need me for?"
With a wave of Galen's hand, the torture droid stops dead in its tracks, pausing a meter away from Han's position. It rotated in place, as if deciding what it should do. A second wave brings the injector in Galen's grasp.
Wedge picks off a shot at Lando, and the stun wave brings the man to his knees. He sags in defeat, and drops the droid control box. When he glances up, first at Galen, then Jado, his eyes are hard, betraying no emotion.
Han and Kyle waited too long to act, and neither made any move against the prisoners. At that moment, two stormtroopers came marching in. "We heard gunfire," one said. "What is the problem here?"
*The poison continues to do damage to Jado, injector or not, doing 3 points this round. Wedge's shot did 16 damage to Lando.
I'll let the torture droid stay still for two rounds, instead of fleeing, but it will return to normal afterwards. And, in case it wasn't obvious, Jado's Persuasion roll failed, even with the Force Point.

Catching the injector in one hand, Galen looked at Kara.
"We don´t. The only reason you are being kept alive is because no order has come to kill you. And I assume doing so would break any chance of making Calrissian talk as well"
Looking back to Jado, he offered a weary look.
"Now, if you are done playing, we have work to do. Should our task fail because of your delay, *you* will have to explain it to my master"

Wedge chuckled. "Ah, the Empire's finest are here. We're saved now."
He points his gun at the currently still torture droid, asking, "Do either of you two geniuses know how to turn this thing off?"

"Or we could shoot it," Kyle says, referring to the torture droid. When no one responds immediately, he shrugs and says, "What? Just a thought."

Kara grimaces, as she glares at Jado, then Galen. "So, what next? Are you going to torture us now for the fun of it? Are you going to prove everything the Rebellion has been saying about the Empire? You can't beat us. The more the Emperor tightens his grip the more star systems will slip through its fingers."
Lando reaches across and shuts down the two droids. "You win."

"I have no interest at all in torturing you, or anyone else for that matter. But I suggest you quiet down, because like I said, there are very few reasons to keep you alive"

With the threat passed, Wedge put away his carbine and felt distinctly uncomfortable. He usually wasn't one to start a conversation, but somehow he felt that something should be said.
"So... where are you going?" Wedge inquire of Galen. He didn't know why he asked; Wedge had never been the curious type, and he hadn't even known this man for long. Even so, he couldn't help but feel... not sad, but... disheartened(?) at the fact he seemed to be leaving the team. He did his best not to show this in his demeanour, however.

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-04 23:08:12)

"Yeah, good question. I show up and suddenly you're in a hurry to leave? Was it something I said?" Kyle asked, looking as close to serious as he could while attempting to lighten the mood. However, he was interested in hearing the answer. After all, unless he was mistaken, this was the individual he had sensed through the Force minutes ago aboard the *Tempest Blade*. If so, Kyle had a vested interest in knowing just what his mission was...

"Don´t ask so many questions Wedge, it will only get you in trouble. Suffice to say that my master has need of my services. And I don´t think anyone of you can help me, but I´ve been told to take the Inquisitor along"
Not quite the whole truth, but neither a complete lie, Galen hoped it would satisfy. He didn´t really have anything against any of the members of Vader´s team, but until his plan was ready to be fully set in motion, he would not include anyone in it.

After Jado pushes Kara at the door, she looks over her shoulder at him. "Where to now, flyboy?"
Back inside, Lando remains sitting on the floor. He looks up at Kyle, defeated. "You heard her. What now?"
Before Kyle could answer, his comm buzzed, as did all the others, at once and in unison.

## Re: Chapter 2: Of Sith Lords and Death Stars

### **zenkatarn** (2010-03-06 20:27:20)

Kyle started to say something to Lando before he noticed his commlink was signaling him. "Hold that thought, rebel, I'll be right with you." With that, he held the comm up to his ear and answered it by saying, "Kyle Katarn speaking."

## Re: Chapter 2: Of Sith Lords and Death Stars

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-09 11:15:43)

Wedge simply activated his comlink and spoke a single word into it.
"Wedge."
He figured that was enough of a greating. If, as it was likely, they were all being contacted by the same person, he'd let Kyle do the talking.

"This is General Tagge. I request your presence in my office immediately. If you have not dealt with our prisoners yet, I suggest you do so."
So, it was General Tagge . . .technically, he had no authority over the group, most of whom were Navy officers anyway. He was, however, third-in-command here, behind only Tarkin and Motti and that did give him some authority over the troops. But, why was he summoning them and not one of his aides? It was quite the menial task, after all.

"Yes sir, we're on our way." Kyle pocketed the commlink and turned to the others, grinning in his usual, friendly way. "So, uh...which way to General Tagge's office?" he asked, having just arrived on the station a few short hours ago.

After pushing Lando and Kara into separate cells in Cell Block 1138, the group finds their way to General Tagge's office. It was a sparse room, though the few holopaintings on the wall were authentic reproductions of Hannikas and Stapomdo. Three chairs sat before the low, broad desk, behind which Tagge paced nervously.
Tagge was a well-built man in his late forties, one-point-eight meters tall. His brown hair was receding and long side burns ran down to his jaw. When the group entered, he turned to face them, straightening his tunic as he did so. He gestured at the chirs, though he remained standing. "I apologize for not having enough chairs for all of you, but those of you who can may take a seat." He sounded nervous, as if unsure what he was doing.

Kyle smiled at the general's offer, but said, "Thank you sir, but I'd rather stand anyway. So what exactly did you call us here for? It sounded urgent." While Kyle made note of the general's apparent nervousness, he made no comment about it. After all, this was still his superior officer, even if something was very clearly bothering him. Whether he was just new to his position or if something else was wrong he couldn't tell, but Kyle knew better than to ask either way.

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-24 00:08:39)

Seeing as Kyle had declined, Wedge was more than happy to take up General Tagge's offer. Sitting down without taking his eyes of the nervous man, he smiled. It was as if all the reasons he'd never officially joined the Imperial army were sitting right in front of him.
