# [Rebel Dawn] Sins of the Past

### **Rowen** (2009-01-11 16:07:02)

**Station Delta-Five, 1330 Hours**
â€œStation Delta-Five, this is Liberty Falcon. Requesting approach vectors to hangars D7 thru 12.â€ Arishi repeated for the third time. â€œDamnit, Looks as though com systems are down!â€ She yelled back so everyone could hear her.  She tapped some commands in the navigation computer. â€œIâ€™m receiving computerized instructions to hangar F9. That puts us a long way from the store room.â€œ  She sighed and piloted the craft on the heading given. Things are never, ever easy. She thought to herself. Its hard to believe I met them for the first time only 9 hours ago.
**Briefing Room, 0430 Hours (9 hours before)**
â€œThe mission is simple,â€ Captain Helms stated. â€œWe are to infiltrate the space station Delta-Five for vital medical supplies. Standard docking procedureâ€™s for medical personnel is through hangars B7 thru B12. We have acquired uniforms, medical apparel, and badges. None of which came cheap.â€  She thumbed her hand control and a hologram of the station appeared, the lights dimmed leaving only the eerie pale blue shimmer of the hologram to illuminate the room.  â€œOur approach should lead us on roughly this path,â€ She demonstrated where their craft should exit hyperspace, a small oval circle appeared a few feet away from the station hologram with a line linking the oval to the station; clearly depicted their entry. â€œStation control should direct us to one of these hangars at that point.â€ She pointed to each of the six hangar bays located on the back side of the station, pausing to make sure everyone was able to visualize there location before thumbing the hand control and sending the room into total blackness before the lights slowly returned to their previous brightness.
â€œWe are to remain inconspicuous and make our way to the storage area. Once there we will gather what supplies we can and leave. After we arrive inside the station  all weapons will be removed before exiting the ship. Scanners leading from the hangar into the station will alert security of any weapons. I donâ€™t believe I need to remind you we donâ€™t need that kind of attention.â€ Arishi absently shuffled her notes and looked over those assembled, they were so young, yet all wanted by the Empire. She gave a weak smile. â€œYou are dismissed until 0530, use this time to gather your belongings and be at the ship waiting. You will have plenty of time to familiarize yourself with the mission in route.â€
**Hangar Bay F9, 1340 Hours (Present time)**
Arishi unbuckled herself from the pilots seat and moved back to the passenger section of the ship. â€œLooks like were the first ones here.â€ She removed her weapons holster and slid her arms into a medical jacket with name badge fixed to the left front. She proceeded to fix her collar and place her long blonde hair in a pony tail. â€œHurry up and get your jackets on and your weapons off. Times ticking.â€
((Each of you add a Lab coat, name badge, and a RFX/K Medisensor to your equipment list. Remember to take any and all weapons off your person))

Tired of travelling through hyperspace, Muurak was glad that theyÂ´d finally reached their destination. He was even gladder when he realized that the persons aquiring the lab coats for them had been considerate enough to remember that there were operatives larger than the common human. Putting on the coat, he looks at the large hammer left next to his blaster. He always felt more confident when he had it with him, but he was no stranger to fighting hand-to-hand either. Usually, his sheer size and physical strength went pretty far even before a situation became dangerous. For safetys sake, he stashed the weapons aside in a small compartment behind food and other rations, just in case they searched the ship.
Wearing the lab coat gave him a pretty strange look, his obsidian fur created quite the contrast. He doubted anyone would notice however, given him imperials generally considered non-humans to be of little importance.
He walked over the ramp leading out of the ship and waited for the others to get ready.

In one corner, a twitchy Gran is inspecting the equipement that had been given to him.  Zeed nervously put the lab coat on, fairly certain from his thorough examination that it wasn't laced with some sort of contact poison.
Zeek's three eyed gaze darted around the room, always focused on one individual or another.  He didn't trust them, not one bit.  There was something to them, there was *always* something.  But he'd just have to deal with it for now; they opposed the Empire, just like him.  It was a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils.
He lay his blaster pistol aside reluctantly, certain that it would be the death of him.  He highly expected this entire mission to be a trap, and eyed the captain suspiciously.  He made a note of something in his datapad, and then commented quietly, "Ready."

Dryyrra was extremely displeased with the slave collar as he swore he would not wear one again, he in fact had growled quite a bit at the Female Captain Helms for handing it to him.
Despite his displeasure he snaps the collar on and lays his weapons in the back from anyone's sight. He falls in behind the others, slouching, he remembers the beatings he got for standing up straight and he still has the scars to remind him of his pride and how it was broken.

Selene held up the slave collar for her inspection, "A slave? of all the things you could have me do you have me act as a slave.."  She shakes her head with a sigh, standing to fix her outfit she'd been given.  honestly it looked like something that would look far better on a Twi'lek slave she saw with the Hutts.  Still it wasn't much different then some of the costumes she wore during that dancer job....Humming softly to her self while fixing the gold scarfs she had brought with her from that same costume.  Letting them flow along her arms and legs.
Shifting her tail to her hands she ties another scarf to the end, swishing her tail a few times to make sure it was tied properly.  All in all the black and gold scarf and two piece slave outfit looked rather good on her fur.  She couldn't help the small smile, she did so love the finer things in life and silk was one of her favorites.  Picking up the collar again she places it around her neck, removing her blaster to sit beside her small bag of other possessions.
Satisfied with her appearence and lack of weapons she moves to join the large walking carpet of a wookiee; fixing her hair before stepping out to give it that messy but neat look.  Taking a breath she moves out slowly, demur and shy taking a step behind the wookiee, head down and hands classped in her lap, tail flicking low to her feet, making it seem to any that looked that she was afraid of being without...hey who was supposed to be their master anyway...*Something tells me this part wasn't thought out well*...
*Deception +15 figured I should throw that in >.>*

Anazider stretches languidly as he rises to his feet, taking the offered lab coat with a sniff of disdain for the cheapness of its fabric. He shrugs on the coat anyway, removing a set of ornamental bangles from his hair to make it more appropriate for the situation. After several moments of meticulous primping and preparation, the prince looks much the part of a successful doctor.
"Well, at least *one* of us may look the part. Suppose if the rest of you are smart enough to not talk too much, we may even pull this off."

Arishi looked each of them over as they fell into a loose group. She shook her head, if they get though this she was going to personally hand what ever body part she could rip off to the maker of these disguises. If thatâ€™s even what you could call them.  â€œAlright,â€ She growled. â€œFollow me and keep your heads down!â€
Arishi led them across the hangar to the exit doors. There were two sets, the first opened to a small corridor which led to a second door that was identical to the first. Each door was roughly a foot thick and retracted into the wall with a soft hiss.  The last door opened into a large hall way that ran right and left. Arishi paused, recalling from memory the route she would need to take.
â€œWere far from the storage room. I had the layout memorized from the initial hangar bays. Going to the right should take us in the initial direction and we can follow the signs to get our bearings.â€ She looked both ways before heading to the right.
The air seemed stuffy in this section of the station. Probably due to neglected  maintenance on the scrubbers. The floors here are dirty, with scuff marks and stains marring the once shiny Dura steel plating. Traffic in this area must be usually high but at the moment not one living soul has appeared.

Selene hung close to the wookiee, holding onto a bit of his fur as she walked just behind him, head still down to continue the look of demur and slave-like, though it did give her a wonderful view of the floor *Doesn't anyone clean this thing?! ugh I'm going to get my feet all dirty, they owe me a long bath after this, a long bath and something shiny.*  Glancing up under her lashes towards where they were going she mumbles softly to the wookiee "So...what's your name fellow apparent slave."

Dryyrra didn't like the cold silence so much but then he had fallen into a trap or two in his time. The Female Feline clinging to him somewhat took his mind away from the dirty metal around them, he missed him home and the tree's but he heard the Feline ask him his name, he decided it best to answer her quickly encase they should be attacked.
Dryyrra: *Shyriiwook* <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Dryyrra....I am not a Slave....I won't let you be one either

Dryyrra lifted his head up towards the Captain Helms and stated what he thought as he doubted many of his fellow companions even spoke or understood his native tongue, not that he could speak another language.

Selene lets a grin pull at the corner of her lip before smothering it quickly "good to meet you Dryyrra, don't worry...we're only acting a part."  she shifts closer masking it as a trip "I won't let them make you one for real."  She gives his arm a squeeze of reassurance, it was nice to make a friend; especially a furry one, reminded her of the other Farghuls back home

Muurak walked quietly with the group. Since he was supposed to appear as another doctor, he didnÂ´t quite keep his head down, but he tried to keep a low profile anyway. He was a little suprised at the condition of the place, heÂ´d have thought imperial discipline would keep things in perfect shape. Not that he minded though, he was used to living on a small ship for weeks at a time.

While Zeed was trying his best to look normal, the quietness of the place unsettled him.  If he was suspicious of a trap before, he was almost certain of it now.
"Something isn't right here..." he muttered to no one in particular, while his eyes darted to and fro.
((Perception +14 to notice anything odd))

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-14 11:36:15)

Muurak almost had to fight to hold back a small laugh.
"Off course thereÂ´s something wrong here. WeÂ´re a bunch of aliens in an imperial facility. Tense down a bit, otherwise the most suspicious about this group will be you"

### **Rowen** (2009-01-14 16:40:41)

As you slowly make your way down the hall you hear the hangar bay doors slide shut with a mechanical â€˜thunkâ€™, and the data pad by the door lets out a series of beeps. Arishi stops in her tracks and turns around, a worried expression now marring her features. Several scurrying sounds are also heard far down the hall mixed with what sounds like the clanging of pots and pans. The sounds seem to be bouncing off the walls and are quite distant.

## Re: Rebel Dawn - Sins of the Past

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-14 16:49:51)

Muurak halts in his steps, looking around him. The hairs on his neck stands on edge, and heÂ´s getting a bad feeling about all this. Casting a look on the captain, he looks down the hall.
"Captain?"

## Re: Rebel Dawn - Sins of the Past

### **Rowen** (2009-01-14 16:52:43)

Arishi appears at a loss, she looks down the hall toward the sounds then back again toward the lock. "Check the hanger doors." She said quietly.

Selene's tail was puffing at that feeling of dread was creeping over her.  This wasn't good, they were all unarmed, well, except maybe the wookiee and herself but even then it would be a long shot between the two of them and whatever was coming after them.  She gives the wookiee's arm a squeeze, a reassurance to herself as well as to keep him calm.  Her tail flicks slowly by her feet in agitation that she was at least keeping from her face.  She mumbles out a soft "you have a back up plan right.." towards the captain of the ship.

## Re: Rebel Dawn - Sins of the Past

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-14 16:58:22)

"Captain! Snap to it!"
Muurak moves over to the doors, looking for some way to get them open. Hopefully he can find some mechanical override for the door, because he is not very good with computers. Looking to the others, he hopes one of them might.
"Anyone can get this thing open? I think itÂ´s computerized"

## Re: Rebel Dawn - Sins of the Past

### **zerah** (2009-01-14 17:04:08)

Selene lets a small smile move across her lips "We have a mission to do first.  I can try to hack it later but it might be better to move on with things."  she looks to the captain through her lashes "your call though."

### **Anazider** (2009-01-14 17:38:28)

"Well, my dear, dear Ms. Helms this is shaping up to be the shortest operation in history. A pity too, I think I look rather dashing as a doctor."
Anazider smirks as he looks from the closing hangar doors to the clamor down the corridor.
"But, it is often said that discretion is the better part of valor. Perhaps now is the time to heed such prudence, and rightly so?"
The Prince looks from Major Arishi to the starship they flew on, and back, quirking an eyebrow in askance.

## Re: Rebel Dawn - Sins of the Past

### **Rowen** (2009-01-14 22:20:34)

Arishi pushes her way to the datapad, studying it for a moment she begins entering codes. The little device started emitting chirps and beeps but the doors did not open. She took a deep breath and turned glaring. "They've locked it down tight. We can get the supplies but if we can't get this door open it wont matter! Something is off here.....that much is certain." She said the last part more to herself than anyone else. "Lets continue on, if nothing else we can gather some Intel on the way. Is everyone *okay* with that?" She shot back sarcastically.

## Re: Rebel Dawn - Sins of the Past

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-14 22:26:25)

Looking at the closed door, Muurak sighs.
*Knew I should have brought the hammer along…*
After hearing his instructions, he smiles at Arishi, glad that that nervous and worried hint he saw in her appears to gone at least for now.
"Well, maybe we can find something a little more...practical...among the supplies that might get it open. Anyway, that noice is starting to get really annoying, anyone else want to go see what it is?"

### **Anazider** (2009-01-15 00:55:30)

"Oh, good. Yes! Quite! Let us stride valiantly onward! I've never willfully walked into a suicide before!"
Anazider returned the woman's sarcasm with a deal more venom, but strode along with the rest just the same. He glanced over his shoulder at the mewling and growling of the Farghul and Wookie, shaking his head despite himself.
"And the nearly-three meter tall Togorian wants company to investigate a scary noise. If ever we work together again, Ms. Helms, I will be *doubling* my rate."
Shoving his hands into his coat, the nobleman groused over his current prospects, but still kept stride with the other members of the small Rebel group as they tip-toed into the ever more precarious situation.

## Re: Rebel Dawn - Sins of the Past

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-15 01:42:28)

Once again, Muurak could barely hold back a laughter. This group was relly something. Although heÂ´d rather listen to the Wookie than the Faleen. Did he think he was a holovid or what?
"You may not have been walking into a suicide before, but I can tell you itÂ´s quite the pleasure. Especially when the guys on the other side realizes itÂ´s their suicide. And I donÂ´t have anything better to do than proceed forward. Do you?"
The Togorian smiled. This was where he liked it the best, right in the heat.

Selene looks up to the wookiee in surprise though it turns to a smile as she looks like back down, giving his arm a light nuzzle "thank you."  Glancing around to the others slightly she lets her eyes fall to the arogent one, honestly everything may have not been thought through properly but there's been tougher jams than this.  Rememebing the wookiee's words about the lizard one she chuckles in her head while looking that one over.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-15 14:14:49)

Having been surprised by the sudden shutting of the door, something seems to have preoccupied Zeed.  In fact, for the first time since he started the mission, his eyes are in fact staying in one place for more than a few moments.
At this moment, he was focusing his attention on the floor, looking at slight disturbances in the dust.  They looked like... like tracks.  Not human tracks, but something had moved through here.  Thinking whatever it was could be up ahead, he instinctively reached for his blaster, but realized that he had left it behind on the ship.
Looking at his options, he decide to put something between himself and whatever could be in front of them.  He looked at the largest members of their group, and decided to stay a few feet behind Muurak.
((*I don't have the rules with me.  Can I make a Survival or Perception check to track the tracks?))*

"Lets move cautiously. There's no telling what we may run into. Although if this were an Imperial trap I would assume they would be flanking us from both side about now."  She glances once more at the hangar door and starts moving slowly down the hall.  "You've got two choices. You can stay here and wait for the inevitable or come with me and go down swinging. Its your choice." She chuckles a bit. "Besides, I wouldn't want our *prince* over there to break a nail."

"The *prince* over here wouldn't want to break a nail either; the required manicure would likely cost you a years pay, which I would gladly see you docked for."
Anazider spends a long moment appraising his nails, unnecessarily buffing them upon the labcoat.
"And your plan makes for one faulty assumption: That we will, as you so eloquently put it, *go down*. I do not lose. So allow me to amend my earlier statement: I've never willfully walked with others to *their* suicides. Do keep up!"
The Prince briskly snaps for the Gran and all the be-furred species of the group to follow him, taking the lead beside Major Helms. He drew himself up to his full height, giving off an air of command an authority that is only found in those who have spent a better part of their lives having their commands obeyed.

Dryyrra watches the Lizard "Prince" walk ahead to the lead with the Major Helms and becomes quite annoyed by the Lizards arrogant attitude, like a Trandoshan he decides to handle it in a similar way but without actually ripping one of his limbs off....yet
Dryyrra quickly moves up to the Lizard and grabs his shoulder *tightly* and with his speech sounding a bit threatening as it was intended, with the roar and growls.

Sad that he didnÂ´t understand the language of the Wookies, Muurak leaned a little closer to Arishi.
"Did you understand that? I didnÂ´t, but IÂ´m pretty sure I would have liked to hear it"
Straightening himself, he walks beside her.
"You sure you donÂ´t want to revise that last statement? IÂ´m beginning to form the opinion that IÂ´d love to see him break a thing or two. Preferrably not nails"

### **Anazider** (2009-01-16 10:03:24)

Anazider looks up at the Wookie, his lips smirking in amusement, yet his jade-green eyes hold a great deal of menace.
"Let me guess: Your feelings are hurt, yes? Well, in that case let me pose to you a question..."
The Prince turns fully to the Wookie, allowing the large creature remain his grip on his shoulder. He folds his hands together before him, speaking slowly and in a voice meant for lecturing children.
"How many *other* Wookies do you think currently reside within this installation? My estimation would be between zero and less-than that. And at the remote possibility that there *are* more of your kind here, I would wager they're not in any position to be roaring and... *gurgling* indiscriminately."
At this, Anazider's smirk turns into a grin of infinite patronizing patience. He remains carefully still, the Wookie not feeling so much as a single heartbeat out of place beneath its massive paw.
"So! You can continue to make an entirely unnecessary scene, and most assuredly invite trouble down upon all of us here, particularly those you likely care about." And at this the nobleman looks from Dryyra and pointedly at Selene, making sure the Wookie captures the full portent of his words before returning his attention to the creature.
"Or you can release me and we can get on with this little bit of adventure, with the added caveat that you will Never. Touch me. Again." Anazider does bat Dryyra's paw aside at this, lightly but assertively so as to brook no further nonsense.

Arishi sighs and mutters to Muurak, "He want's to rip parts of his body off. Excuse me for a second."
Arishi whirls around. "Honestly! What the hell are you guys doing. Now is not the time for this. We all eat, druink, and breath the same air. To think of yourself better than any one person in this group." She pointedly looks to Anazider. "Is foolish."
She turns to face the group squarely. "Remember this, and remember it well. It may be the Wookie or any other being in this group that saves your ass. Never forget that!" After saying her peace she turns sharply and continues down the hall.
Slowing her walk to make sure they stay with in hearing range she adds one more thing. "I doubt any species other than human reside on this installation.........any Falleen here wouldn't be in any position to flaunt there arrogance either, would they?"
As she continues the clattering around the corner picks up and a soft breeze blows stale, moldy air into your face. Arishi flattens against the bulkhead, slowly inching forward toward the corner.

This time Muurak didnÂ´t hold back his laughter, but he did dampen it a bit. As Arishi moved on, he continued at her side, giving her a reassuring smile.
As they approached a bend in the corridor, he stayed a few meters behind her, waiting for her to scout what awaited them.

### **Anazider** (2009-01-16 21:43:54)

Anazider cants his head at an angle during the upbraiding, wearing an enigmatic smile throughout.
"...Feisty. I like that. You're rather pretty when you are angry, miss Helms. I believe we shall get along quite well."
The Prince laughs breathily to himself, shaking away the admonishment. But when Arishi flattens against the wall, all amusement and arrogance leaves, replaced by cold and shrewd calculation. He reaches for a blaster pistol and vibroblade that aren't there, mentally berating himself for the action.
"Well, it would seem your ass-saving speech may soon prove prophetic..."

Arishi inches closer to the edge, she looks back and mouths. "Wait here for my signal." Then darts around the corner. You can hear her feet padding along swiftly, it doesn't take long for the sounds to fade under the banging and scraping.  After what seems minutes you wonder what has become of her, she has not signaled for anyone and you hear nothing over the constant drum of noise and wind.

### **Rowen** (2009-01-18 18:16:33)

Selene's tail was fully puffed at this time. She clung more to the wookie, her head shaking. "What should we do," her voice was barley audible.

### **Anazider** (2009-01-18 20:29:21)

"This... *breeze* is disturbing. Unless the environmental controls are extremely malfunctioning, there shouldn't be anything strong enough to create a wind throughout this facility."
Anazider drums his chin in idle contemplation, staring at the spot that Arishi had just vacated. He nods to himself, as if concluding some inner dialogue.
"We are ripe for picking, standing here as we are without any weapons. We can either a) continue with the plan, in hoping that we encounter miss Helms in good health, sans a mean of communicating with us as an explanation. B) we go back for our weapons, the stations scanners be damned, and then continue onward to face what invariably will be laying in wait. Or c) continue to wait here for a signal that is appearing more and more as if it won't be coming."
The Prince turns to the rest of the group, looking each in the eye as he stands with his arms folded across his chest.
"Votes. Now."

Muurak turns to the faleen, and looks at the way Arishi disappeared with a worried look.
"I was thinking about it as well,  and there is a fourth possibility that she has found something out and has been forced to lay low. If so, our barging in there might disrupt the whole thing"
He stretches out his hands and fingers before forming them to fists.
"However, that doesnÂ´t counter the fact that she might also be in danger, so my answer is clear. We go after her off course"

Dryyrra walk past the Lizard with a growl and nods at the Male Feline with a show of approval and heads into the hallway to get a look of the layout. Dryyrra knows he isn't a scout so he knows he probably couldn't find the Captain but hopes one of the others can find the way.

Not understanding a word of the wookieÂ´s roar, but getting the main point of it and starts moving to follow him. Looking back at the others, he smiles.
"Well, that makes two of us who thinks thatÂ´s a good idea. And frankly, if she is in trouble, we really should make haste"
A few quick strides brings him up aside the wookie, and as they moves down the corridor he looks all around, seeking any trace of what happended to Arishi, as well as anything that might be useable as a weapon, should it come to that.

"It's a trap, you idiots!" Keed hisses between his teeth, though not at anyone in particular.
He rushed forward, mainly because he didn't want to be seperated from the only two of their group who looked like they could defend themselves unarmed.  His eyes darted in every direction, trying to spot the hidden attackers he was sure where waiting, all the time muttering, "We should go back.  This isn't good.  This isn't good."

"Yes! Good! Roaring and charging should solve this one straight away! And if those two don't work, we still have slobbering and howling left in the arsenal, with pissing and swearing being held in reserve, in case of a real dust-up!"
Anazider stands aside, allowing the Togorian and the Wookie to rush right past him. He follows on the hells of the Gran, staying to the rear of the small party with Selene.
"And I agree with our paranoid, tri-ocular friend here, as incredible as that sounds. But hey, bravado and not-thinking has gotten us this far, might as well stay the course!"
The Prince clasps his hands behind his back, strolling along with the group as if this were a day at Coruscanti Central Park, and not a potentially hostile situation.

She looks over to the rather arrogant male that had fallen into step beside her "and perhaps you shouldn't try and antagonize the others mm?  Now, all get this done so we can leave, get paid and some of us can take a long bath."

### **Rowen** (2009-01-20 20:32:46)

Moving around the corner gives you a clear view of where Arishi went to. You see her leaning up against a banister, her form hunkered over it. The hall leading to her location is strewn with chairs, bent pieces of metal and other various desk assortments. It looks as though the platform the Major is standing on is a promenade for something much larger and would indicate your at least not on the first floor of this part of the station.
Moving slowly to her location you can see the promenade is of an octagon shape, with three doors arranged on each edge of the octagon. The other side is a exact mirror of the hall you just exited from.
The banister over looks a atrium, its beauty must have been a sight in its time. Now the topiary's are uprooted, the suspended waterfall lay crumbling with water falling unevenly across the remaining falls shattered surface. Bodies lay in wrecked heaps as if they had been thrown around like some child's rag doll.
The source of the air seems to come from above where a huge fan had crashed through the roof and hangs, suspended from its cables. Several of the protective grates on the fan had broken and on occasion are sucked into the fan blades creating the sound of banging metal. The cables, which you can only assume are to power the large fan extend up the entire 5 floors to the ceiling above.
The promenade you currently stand on is littered with papers, desk assortments and furniture. Several bodies appear to be mixed in with the clutter.
Arishi appears to be crying and you hear her repeat over and over. "What happened. Whats going on." Her knees buckle and she slowly sinks to the floor.

Selene gasps at the awful sight, moving to the Majors side and kneels beside her.  Looking out to the bodies and the mess of what was sure to have been a beautiful area to relax in she shakes her head "Something bad went on here...I suppose that explains why the door shut so quickly on us; must be protocol to lock down or something."  She rubs the girls back slowly "Come on Major, we need to get moving with this mission."

Anazider mostly ignored Selene's prattling about being an antagonist, relegating it to background noise. He soon forgets her completely as he takes in the full scope of the battle tossed scene.
"...I think we can forget about the weapon scanners at this point. I think it best if we secure Major Helms back within the ship, and gather what we shall need, before venturing beyond this point."
The Falleen speaks in cold, emotionless tones, the scornful sarcasm of before evaporated in an instant. He moves to the nearest body, roughly analyzing the corpses and surrounding papers like one not unfamiliar with death.

Halting at the sight before him, Muurak looks around. The place was a total mess, and bodies were scattered around them. As he spotted the Major, he moved quickly alongside Selene to her. No medic, he still checks her for any obvious signs of injury. But he has a feeling that she might simply have collapsed out of shock.
As he looks over at his companions, he notices how the lizard seems to have changed. ThereÂ´s a more serious tone over him now, as if he changed completely. Shaking his head, Muurak answers him.
"IÂ´m not sure weÂ´d be able to do that. I get the feeling weÂ´ve been set up real bad, and weÂ´ll most likely find heavy resistance back at the ship"
As the wookie calls for his attention, he looks up towards the ceiling, the fan and he hanging wires.
"IÂ´m not so sure pal. Those wires should be harmless, but you donÂ´t know whatÂ´s up there"

"We've not traveled far from the ship. And if we confront an enemy that can not only avoid our detection, but do so while also setting up an ambush, than we are all walking corpses."
The nobleman speaks with a cool detachment, as if discussing the current state of the Galactic markets rather than the possibility of his own death.
"Besides, the ship is a known entity. What you propose is to traipse into the darkness with no clue as to what we face, unarmed, and with the Major in so... fragile a condition, and inexplicably so."
Anazider continues to inspect the surroundings, speaking over his shoulder to the Togorian as he does so.
"It is clear we should be armed for whatever awaits in the rest of the facility, and the best means to achieving that currently rests within the ship."

**Anazider:**
Anazider moves to inspect the papers and nearest body. Blood pools just under the scattered documents which appear to be supply requisitions and patient care profiles. The person seems to have died from what seem to be bite wounds and either knife wounds or claw marks, its difficult to tell.
**Others:**
Selene and Muurak seem to have calmed the Major who slowly wipes her eyes and moves to a kneeling position. See looks up, sighs heavily and stands. "I apologize," She whispers. "I was over whelmed by all of this." Turning to look at the Anazider. "I agree with you. But how do you propose we hack the doors lock?"

### **Anazider** (2009-01-23 09:57:11)

Anazider remains crouched as he inspects the body, delicately turning one of the nearest files over and reading it to himself before setting it back down.
"Fang wounds, something big too. Some of these gashes look about the size of what a vibroblade would make, but they're too ragged for a vibroblades clean cut."
He rises to his feet, dusting his hands on his stolen labcoat as he stands.
"You said you would try hacking into the door later." Anazider peers at Selene as he speaks, "Well I dare say that the time has now come. If you brought a datapad, use it to interface with the door's locking system, or your Med scanner if you have to."
"Can you walk, Major? Regardless of whether or not we can get that door open, we will have to move quickly, and we will need everyone as able bodied as they can be."
The Prince projects an air of cold confidence as he looks out over the atrium, particularly the three doors and the opposing hallway, attempting to discern from this vantage point of any of them appear recently used.

"I can walk," Came Arishi's quick reply. Her eyes narrowed. "This mission just got a lot more complicated." She started for the hall leading back to the ship. "Set up or not, we have to report what we find back to the Rebellion. If the Empire is involved there's no telling what to expect. So lets exercise extreme caution until we know the extent of the situation." With that she turns and slowly moves back down the hall.

Selene couldn't help the little grin of joy, she did so love getting new information; especially if she could sell it to the highest bidder.  Nodding her head she helps the major for a few paces before letting her walk on her own.  Her outfit didn't exactly offer much in the way of hiding anything but reaching into the top part that gave amble few of the female chest, she pulls out a datapad to which she then fixes herself while walking; as though pulling things from ones bra was entirely normal for her.

"Remind me to buy you a new datapad once we return. Or perhaps a portable holo-database, that would likely serve better." The Prince walks idly forward, leaning lightly on one of the damaged rails as he peers at the hallway just across the way.
"None of those other doors look recently used, but the opposite hallway is too far off to tell. Give it one more shot, if you are so inclined, but it seems someone, or thing, is forcing our hand here."

**Hangar Door:**
Muurak checks the doors datapad and finds that it is in working order and nothing appears to be broken or malfunctioning. Selene's data pad is beyond repair however as the internal circuitry seems to have been fried.
Arishi pushes off the bulkhead to a standing position and glances at Selene's datapad. "I don't think wasting another datapad is necessary. I think we should search those rooms and see what information we can dig up." She brushes her bangs from her eyes. "Might even find some weapons."
She turns, walking back toward the promenade. The wind from earlier seems to be dieing down. "Shall we search as one group? Safety in number ya know." She drawls.

"It seems to be coming from in here. IÂ´m no expert, but it sounds like a comm system or something like that. I suppose it would be worth checking out"
He stops for a moment to see if anyone has an objection before opening the door. Not that he would listen anyway, but just opening the door right away would probably set of the mouth on the Faleen again, and his ears was already growing soar.

Selene noticed it was humanoid but could not have been human and lashed out with her claws, missing the creature as it sped past.

The Prince staggers into the room, regaining his composure in time to nearly-shoulder the Togorian out of the way and its bumbling attempt at deceptive diplomacy.
"We are a part of a supply delivery and were to take on outbound passengers. It appears the station is overrun; what is your status?"
((Knowledge Galactic Lore +10 to identify the creature as it goes over the side and Deception +16 for the bit about the supply run.))

The old man chuckles at the other end. "Boy you aren't much of a liar are you? If one of your friends had been bitten you would know it and wouldn't be a calm as you are." He pauses and sighs. "Your arrogant partner is a bit better than you however. Okay, Ill believe your delivery personnel." You can hear him shuffling papers and tapping on the desk.
"What that creature is, is extinct! Well it was extinct I should say.....they were a fine bit of work. Hmmm, yes.....where was I?" He clears his throat. "If one of your partners IS bitten its best to just kill them.....its better that way....less painful."
A few moments pass and he continues. "My status you ask? is trapped. That's why I locked you out of your ships hangar. I'm to old to fight my way out and you were my only hope.....no one else is alive. If you come get me, Ill release the door so we can all leave. Deal!?"

"It would seem you have us at a disadvantage. All-knowing, all-seeing, and you've the means to orchestrate our deaths." Frustration bleeds into his voice, but his countenance remains deathly calm.
He shakes his head, planting his hands on the desktop as he looms over the speaker.
"What has happened here? All of it now, mind you. You trap us here with vicious, supposedly-extinct beasts, and demand we come to rescue you. The very least you owe us is a more thorough explanation."

"Keeping you alive is my priority, if you can't live through this neither do I. So it would server no purpose to kill you. As for what happened here.....all I can say is an experiment gone wrong. These Rakghoul's as they are called lived a very long time ago. seems the Empire found some DNA and have been trying to recreate the disease." He pauses and you hear more shuffling of paper.
"They can mutate others by biting them, but its not always 100%. The former scientists seem to think they have something wrong in the formula because the infection rate should be 100% with a bite." He sighs. "When things got out of hand they notified the Imperials and a clean up crew should be on the way....something neither of you, or I want to be here for I'm sure."
"That answer all your questions?"

Of course you need to be careful you don't run into one of those nasty beasts. Your best bet is to head opposite where you came in from......that area will be identical to the one you are currently at. Head to the ground floor and take the eastern hallway, the security office is in the back.

"...Right then. At this point I would very much prefer the feel of a blaster in my hand. Let's move; every moment we spend dawdling is a moment for these... *Rakghouls*," He spits the word with a great deal of venom, "To catch up with us, and I've better things to do than to be left slavering and twisted."
He then exits the communications room, not spearing a backwards glance for the comm panel or the undoubtedly insane man at its other end. The Prince spares another glance for the tortured creature spitted on the shard of duracrete near the waterfall, his gaze lingering on the fallen Major, before he turns his full attention to the opposing hallway and begins a slow march into its depths.

**"The little room told us to go to a bigger little room, where we can find pew-pew toys to make the bad bitey things go away."** He speaks to Selene without looking at her, in the slow deliberate tone meant to instruct small children on simple matters.
**"Really now, lizard-breath? The Falleen species is classified as a Reptomammal, and how would you identify a certain breath as being lizardly? Baffling. Do try to keep up now, this wastes precious time."**
The Prince's longer legs lead him to stride further along, maintaining an easy gait for Muraak, the wookie and Zeed, but causing the more diminuitive Farghul to have to hustle to maintain pace.

Selene couldn't believe it, he was arrogant, he was rude, and he was treating her as though she were an idiot or some small kitten.  She growls lowly, and damn it all he was probably doing it just to get a rise of her, and damn him for it was working very well.  *When this is over and we're on the ship, I'll skin him alive and make him into a purse* she promised herself. 
"Your breath is lizard like in scent, it lacks the smells of more civilized beings instead it has a stench depicting one who's prone to crawling on his belly most of life in the evolutionary train."  she drawls out.  She was still jogging to keep up but didn't even break a sweat too absorbed in her thoughts of how much she was going to enjoy making him into a purse, maybe some nice gloves to go with it.  Her mother did love shoes, the heeled ones, she may not wear them but she loved to have them for a collection; some nice lizard ones would make her so happy.

Going thorough the identical hallway leads to a room you could swear you just exited. The set up is the same save for the litter strewn about in different areas of the promenade. In several sections the railing is missing and you can see bodies litter the ground floor below, mixed within those bodies are dead Rakghouls.
Apparently they began to put up a fight, over turned tables made feeble barricades that show obvious signs of damage. The only difference from this room and the last are the inclusion of stairs that lead to each level. This part of the station also covers more floor, ascending a total of 50 floors by a ruff estimate.

Anazider peers over the railing down into the carnage on the floor below, his pouty lips twisting in distaste.
**"Well, that will not be fun to pick through. Still, there may be something useful to be found amongst the rubble."**
The Prince's frown turns pensive, and he takes on a look of detached curiosity as he makes his way toward the stairs of the ground floor, attempting to discern the best means to get to the eastern hallway with minimal contact with the creatures.

Clutching his forehead at the sight of the ecstatic Gran, Muurak moves to follow the strange creature. Grabbing his shoulder with a firm grip, the Togorian hopes he can at least get some amount of seriousness through.
"Listen, I donÂ´t care what you think youÂ´ve found, and I most likely never will. But if you want to keep any hope of telling someone about what youÂ´ve found, *keep it down*"
Leaving Zeed be, he starts to rummage through the mess, careful not to get too close to any of the bodies. Like the Faleen said, there might be something useful there. It looked like these men had at least put up a fight, so maybe a weapon of some sort could be found. or at least, he wanted to make sure the Rakghouls were in fact all dead.

Selene frowns at the scene, her ears flicking while her tail lifts to keep off the floor. Her nose wrinkles to the smell "ugh..." putting a paw/hand to her nose she moves towards the body, toeing a close one before bending to look through the pockets and articles of clothing and the like on the bodies. She wasn't going to waste an opportunity to liberate valuables after all.

As Anazider flows down the stairs to the bottom floor and spots a rather obvious path between the bodies of the fallen. The eastern corridor appears mostly clear with no bodies in your line of site.
As Zeed rummages through the fallen he managed to find a data card. It reads 'Dr Lynn Brooke' further down in fine print galactic you notice 'Security Clearance Alpha'.
Selene begins searching the fallen as well with a different agenda. Among her rummaging she find a Blaster Pistol and a credit chip worth 400 credits.
Muurak stumbles across a sporting Blaster Pistol, his foot knocking it loose as he inspects the Rakghouls. Something in the pile next to the pistol begins to move, a Rakghoul emerges and lets out a howl before setting its eyes on Muurak.

Glad to find something that even remotely counts as a weapon, MuurakÂ´s eyes shifts a bit as something starts to stir in the pile next to him on the floor. As the rakghoul emerges, he pulls the trigger almost on instinct, firing at the beast from point blank range before backing away warily, ready to fight it with hand and fist if needed.

As Selene rummaged through dead, Dryyrra attention was focused to the now rising Creature that had killed the Major Helms Earlier, Dryyrra knew that this creature could kill the weaker ones, the lizard he wouldn't mind so much but when he though of it getting to Selene, Dryyrra became enraged at the thought and Roared Quite Fiercely.

Muurak reacts with amazing speed, hitting the creature full in the flank and moving back a few paces. The Rakghoul howls in pain.
Selene continues rummaging through the piles and manages to find a datapad. Just after picking it up a flash of fur rushes past.
Zeed studies the creature as the action before him unfolds. He notices the creature had been wounded before the fight ever began.
Anazider searches for what seems an eternity before finally finding a broken table leg that *could* be used as a club.
Dryyrra impacts with the creature just after Muurak blasted it. Dryyrra's size and shear power vaulted the Rakghoul into the air, slamming it against the wall. The creature fell to the floor with a sickening thud and did not move.

Selene grins in glee at finding a new datapad to replace her own, though it was short lived as a sudden rush of fur flies past her. Her tail twitches as she watches the wookiee slam into the creature, the sound of it falling making her fur crawl; all the same though..."wow...impressive.."
Putting the datapad into her chest piece she picks her way through the bodies daintily, making her way to the wookiee "Dryyrra, I must say if it wasn't dead before it sure is now! What a hit! I've never seen a body go flying like that before that was really amazing!" An enigma this farghul seemed, one minute cocky, the next a thief, and the next amazed by brute force, all wrapped into a form that held herself tall with fancy things.

Muurak lowered the gun as Dryyrra charges past him and slams into the rakghoul, sending it flying. Not taking any chances, he walks right up past the Wookie, aiming a shot right at the creatures skull, to ascertain its death.
Checking the pistol to see if it had any charges left, he turns around and offers Dryyrra a pat on the shoulder.
"Nice work pal. LetÂ´s just hope we donÂ´t need to do that again"
Looking around, he searches for Anazider.

"Don't be too impressed," Zeed butted in on his Dryyrra's praise, "The thing *was* injured."
Despite his words, however, Zeed eyed the wookie warily. He made a mental note not to get into a fight with the beast.
Turning his attention towards the creature, Zeed had a thought.
"Do you think we could take a sample with us? Perhaps we could find a way to get it analysed. And anyway, its hard evidence!"

### **Anazider** (2009-03-14 01:00:33)

Anazider gives the table leg a practiced swing or two, nodding himself before looking up to see how the Togorian is fairing against the Rakghoul. Just as he does look up he spies Dryyrra's collision with the creature, which solicits a soft grunt from the Prince.
**"Right then. Well, I suppose we have now learned that either these creatures retain enough cognizance to lay in ambush, or this one in particular was stunned recently enough to be roused by our passing."**
Leaning on the table leg, the nobleman frowns at Zeed and extends his hand to Murrak, for the blaster pistol.

Zeed starts rummaging through the various things scattered about the floor. After several minutes he comes across a test tube vial rack, most lay smashed however, but laying a few feet away and perched precariously on the edge of some decorative stones lay one, unbroken vial.
Muurak tosses the weapon to Anazider and starts his own search. His luck seems to hold up as he uncovers a heavy blaster pistol with half its charge left. Next to the weapon he also finds a security badge, the name is illegible but the persons position is clearly visible, 'Head of Security'.
Selene and Dryyrra stand off to the side contemplating the situation.

Anazider, Muurak and Zeed gather themselves and move forward toward the Security room. The hallway leading to the room has less debris than the main room. Several blood splatters adorn the walls on each side with the bodies that must have been the source laying near by. The security door lies just before you, its keypad and card reader glowing light blue in the dimly lit corridor.
Dryyra assists Selene with her search, both oblivious that the others have moved forward toward the security room. Several minutes pass with some success. With Dryyra's help Selene was able to uncover 2 Datapads (intact), 300 credits worth of credit chips, 3 Key coded badges, 2 rings worth 200 credits each and a Blaster with only a quarter charge left.

Selene grins brightly at the new items and, even more happily, at the credit chip. She squeals happily and throws her arms around the large wookiee, tail flicking happily "Oh Dryyrra! You're good at this! look at how much we found!"
She leans back and grins happily holding up one of the rings to him "You should wear this one." pulling away she holds the other up to the light to look at "we should share it all since we both found it. There is some honor in this after all." She smirks with a wink before looking around the room.
"oops...looks like the others have gone on without us.." She sighs and stores the datapads with the other before looking up to the tall wookiee again "shall we catch up?"

Dryyrra kinda smiles at Selenes excitement from the materialistic items she found amongst the dead, he thought about the concept of honor they had at home with the dead that they did not bury them with their possessions but gave them to family or ones the deceased had deemed honored friends.
Dryyrra then comes back to the present as he too notices now that the others had left, their scents wavering as they have been gone for a short time.
Dryyrra *Shyriiwook* "They left us some time ago...we best follow them...I will protect you should we run into anymore of those foul beasts."
The Wookiee was not sure why he stated he would protect her but perhaps he was reassuring himself that he would not fail to protect her as he did his village.
Dryyrra stayed close to Selene as they made their way towards the others.

Selene nods her head, linking an arm with his. She had caught the far-away look on his face when she had held up the ring and wondered if maybe she had crossed a line? It was typical for her in the line of work, in her family, in her life to take the things off the dead to use them for the greater mission or even simply to help oneself outside of it.
*The dead don't need the items, they would only go to waste…at least if we all survive we can use them to our benefit….and the rings are shiny..*
She moves with the wookiee after the others quiet for a minute before speaking "thank you...for wanting to protect me. and um..." she bites her lip "sorry..if..the looting was um...unpleasant for you to watch or partake in.."

Dryyrra looked down at Selene as he walked with her.
Dryyrra *Shyriiwook* "They no longer needed their possessions....we do not bury our kind with them..it is a last honor to them that we give away their possessions to their family."
Dryyrra returned his attention to the hall looking to make sure they were heading the right way.
Dryyrra *Shyriiwook* "Did the dead carry anything we can use to escape this place of death and metal?"

Selene nods her head and looks through the three badges "I think so, These bages might help us in getting out of here, at least to open a few doors maybe." She holds them close to her eyes wondering if there was any outward sign of what they could entail; all while keep close to the wookiee, letting him stear her as they walk.
*Perception +8*

The muzzle of the blaster pistol scanned from left to right, Anazider holding it with a professional alacrity. As the group inched closer and closer to the security room door, the nobleman looked back to assess the composition of his comrades, and frowned as the Wookie and the Farghul lingered behind.
Shaking his head, the Prince frowned at the card reader, then checked the edges of the door and its surrounding area, attempting to ascertain whether it had been used recently.
