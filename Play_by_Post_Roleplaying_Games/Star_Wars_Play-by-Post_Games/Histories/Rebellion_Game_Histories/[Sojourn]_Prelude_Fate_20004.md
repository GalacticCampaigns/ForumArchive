incoming message pending ......

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-27 09:52:08)

Still a little upset that your last mission ended in failure. Stupid mercenary guild, how where you suppose to know that they where on the same mission as you. At least you walked away from that mission, and not even a thank you for completing their mission. No low on funds you find yourself stuck on the core world of Varlbrindal.
A huge planet covered primarily with a planet-wide cityscape, but it also features massive polar glaciers. The planet is known for its orbiting space station and extensive military infrastructure. The system has an impressive starship junkyard sections of which are often used for live fire exercises. The deep undercity layers are infested with nomads & predatorial indigenous species, either of which make for interesting hunting diversions. The Imperial presence is a significant stabilizing force for the area.
The graffiti is an interesting message, if not a foreign one to your eyes. Being a hero you canâ€™t help to think what that would be like.
This â€œdrifterâ€ â€¦. Is he bleeding? A red wet stain dominates his right side. He winches as he begins to speak. â€œHey you â€¦ want to fight for justice?â€
The column of storm troopers can be heard marching through the street behind you. Coughing the drifter continues â€œI can get you off this rock.â€ You can see the desperation in his eyes; you have seen men with this look before during your missions.

### **zerah** (2008-10-28 10:04:08)

Tar'ja looks the drifter over, glancing quite a few times to the blood; he really should have that looked at, and the eyes that were so desperate. "Fight for Justice..." a glance to the storm troopers, watching them walk by. She really hated them, dispised the Empire "..be a hero.." she mumbles, lekku wiggling slightly as she thought.
Her eyes close then open to look at him, though she doesn't smile her eyes hold one she'd dearly love to get off this hellhole, besides, maybe a change would do her some good. "What do I have to do."

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-28 13:45:21)

The drifter forces a smile at you and looks around nervously. When he believes the area is clear he reaches behind a spent carbon casing and grabs a small case. Its clearly metallic and locked, from the looks of it a good one too.
The drifter holds the case as a mother to her child. There it is again that look of desperation. He would not be doing this unless he had no choice in the matter. "This must be delivered to the docking ports ..... You mus" he staggers to a fit of coughing which forces him to spit up blood. He is in bad shape.
"This world is in danger, these people, the rebels." He moves towards you still holding the case. "Please get this to safety many lives are at risk I will cover you the best I can."
As he comes near weakness takes over him and he uncontrollably falls at your feet.

---

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2008-10-28 14:10:28)

Tar'ja stepped back when the man fell, looking down to him with a tilt of her head. *So much for covering me.* she grabs up the box and looks it over a few times, even testing the lock. well, she wanted off, she needed a ride and if this needed to go to the docks atleast she could stow away on something if need be. A glance to the man, a flick of lekku and a sigh before finally grabbing the mans shirt and dragging him back to the wall. "What am I suppossed to do with you now, you didn't tell me everything." She crouchs down and frowns, she couldn't just leave him; not without knowing what else would be needed of her.
A sigh and a mutter before poking him in the arm "hey..wake up, I need to know who this thing goes to."

---

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-29 12:18:41)

The lock is solid with a multi-coded key pad. You have doubts that you could open it without the proper tools. When you poke the drifter he stirs back to like.
â€œYou must help me!â€ He grabs your arm in desperation, pleading with you. â€œTake it to docking bay 42T. To the â€¦. Shabby he will know what to do.â€
In a blur of motion you would not have expected from the Drifter he attaches something to your wrist. With a click metal binders lock you to the case, with a hum the energy link comes to life completing the lock between your wrist and the case. No cutting that with conventional tools.
The drifter staggers off into the street beyond. Turning back the drifter mutters â€œFor Sia â€¦. Now go!â€ He steps out into the street. Voices can be heard, bad voices, radio assisted voices:
-â€œThere he is.â€
-â€œHalt, right there.â€
-â€œYouâ€™re under arrest.â€
Then a series of blaster shoots are heard followed by the drifter yelling â€œFor Sia!â€

---

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2008-10-29 15:59:07)

Tar'ja was up and running before the blaster shots could even be fired. She glances to the case now attached to her arm and sighs "wonderful." Still, he seemed desperate, she had a possible ticket out of her, and a distraction to get away quickly.
Weaving her way through various areas, even taking a higher ground at one point just to make sure if she was being followed they would have a hell of a time trying to catch up, she makes her way to the docks. Only stopping a few times to gain her bearings, she'd been here long enough to atleast, if nothing else, know where to go to get *off* the planet.

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-30 09:16:34)

Having spent more then a few days on Varlbrindal direction is no issue for you. Though given another week you would know every short cut. Passing another block you come to a make shift imperial blockade. Short cuts would be good about now.
Three imperial troopers stand guard at the end of the street. One checks over ID`s while the other two watch the slow moving crowd. They are using a command chariot parked sideways on the street to block most of the way. Another two troopers canvas the crowd directing the traffic towards the blockade for processing.
The people of Varlbrindal heavily human in population follow suit. It reminds you of the nerf herds on this planet and many others. You do notice the troopers giving non-humans extra encouragement to move along. That encouragement is usually followed with the but of their rifles.
One of the two troopers addresses you now â€œYou there move along. Co-operate and you can go back to your day.â€ His helm speaker gives is command and aura of distance, its cold and uncaring.

---

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2008-10-30 09:59:17)

Tar'ja snears at the blockade, though to keep from beig asked any questions she turns away from the troopers and walks away to dug down the corner to think. She needed a way around them "Why didn't I explore more when I had a chance.." she mumbles to herself, lekku shifting as she looks around idly wondering if one of the other non-humans knew shortcuts.
*perception +8*

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-31 09:17:39)

Scanning the area you notice that many of the side streets have been blocked or are guarded. Lone troopers stand guard watching the crowd from within the side streets. Beside you a young pink Twi`lek stares at your energy binder. Her pace has slowed so that she could get a better look.
Ahead you notice that non-humans are being forced aside to make way for faster human processing. Beside you a trooper shoves the little girl â€œI said move along!â€
In the distance an eruption rocks the ground at your feet. Many are knocked to the ground. Over the buildings a column of smoke rises in the distance. It is in the direction you left the drifter.

---

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2008-10-31 12:01:21)

Tar'ja makes to grab the girl when she's pushed, glaring at the trooper for even thinking of hurting one of her kin. However, very aware of the binder on her wrist she pulls the girl with her away from the trooper, only to stumble at the eruption, looking over to where the drifter was. Idly she'd wonder if they'd ever meet again while the more dominent part that was more concerned with getting of the rock was thankful she wasn't where he was. Once far enough she'd turn to her, checking her over "do you know how to get to the docks, any other way to get there."
*Perception +8*

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-05 11:43:56)

Moments after the first explosion others follow. The can be heard in the distance throughout the city. The crowd erupts in confusion many rush the checkpoint while others try to take cover.
As you ask the little girl for another way out you notice she is crying â€œMommy â€¦. mommy where are you?â€ Tears stream down her checks.
The storm troopers try to maintain order but can barely be heard above the roar of the crowd. Another explosion sets off in the distance. In an attempt to control the crowd two of the troopers open fire above the crowdâ€™s heads.

---

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2008-11-05 13:43:29)

Tar'ja couldn't believe it, really. There were bombs going off, her hope for someone knowing how to get out of here was crying and now...there were blasters flying overhead. Yes overhead, because as mean as she was, she wasn't about to be shot, and certainly not one of her kin who wanted her mommy. Tar'ja had ducked at the first shots, gathering the girl to her to protect her from harm while looking around. There was enough confusion at the gate that she thought she might be able to get the two of them past the guards. All they really needed was an opening. "Alright calm down, we're going to get to the docks ok? Your mommys fine, I'll bet she's even gotten inside and looking for you alright? I'm gonna need you to run when I start to."
*Persuation +4, Perception +8 in looking for an opening to run through*

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-06 14:16:35)

Just as you begin to comfort the child you see the crowdâ€™s behavior explodes. Citizens are trampled as many try to flee. The troopers are left with the impossible task of regaining control over the riot, several troopersâ€™ fire into the crowd. From the corner of your eye you notice a Twi`lek woman trampled under the rioters.
The few troopers that where stationed at the check points all have their hands full. Many of the citizens run for the side streets looking to escape. Hundreds of people on the street only add to the chaos. The noise drowns out the next set of explosions.
The girl still sobbing nods at your request. Tears running down her checks she firmly holds your hand not letting go. You cannot help but to notice the similarities between the girl and the trampled woman.

---

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2008-11-06 15:58:45)

Her heart just missed a beat at the sight of the woman, could anyone survive that? She didn't want to go to her, would rather get the girl to the docks with her, but she had to try. No one should be without family, and the girl..well..she didn't need to end up like her.
Taking her hand tightly with the instructions "don't let go of me." Tar'ja leads the way to the woman, shoving people away without much care until they were able to reach the woman, hoping as she felt for a heartbeat.
*Treat Injury +8 right?*

---

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-10 10:49:49)

As hard you try to push your way through the crowd ten more push back. With the girl in tow the crowd takes you closer to the check point and further from the trampled woman. At this point you have passed several others trampled or shoot in the chaos.
A few troopers maintain their fire on the crowd, firing on the people. Beside you an Iltorian merchant drops to rifle fire from a trooper in a side street. You can see through the chaos around you the trooper take aim, his aim is low not meant for you. His aim is low â€¦. His aim is leveled at the little girl.

---

## Re:Fate

### **zerah** (2008-11-10 19:51:09)

Tar'ja stares at the guard then the girl, pulling her quickly to her other side and pushing someone else into the line of sight, letting her pull the girl further into the crowd. The thought of checking on the woman was gone, they needed to get past those guards and to the docks. Grabbing the girl quickly, the woman moves her onto her back so they can run faster.

---

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-11 11:21:52)

The roar of the crowd is deafening, more blasts can barley be heard above it. The trooper fires his carbine time stands at a still. The little girls face twists in horror as she sees the blaster carbine flash.
Your life style has forced you to think on your feet, it has made you resourceful. To the surprise of the closest citizen your quick reflexes have forced him into the line of fire providing the girl some amount of cover.
The shoot slams against the mans chest dropping him to the ground. At the sight if this the little girl lets out a high pitched shriek. The noise of her scream is dampened within the surrounding chaos.
Reaching down to pick up the girl you can see the trooper change targets and take aim at you!
(OOC initiative Tar`ja 23 trooper 6 LOL ))

## Re:Fate

### **zerah** (2008-11-11 21:41:25)

Tar'ja curses under her breath, ducking into the crowd of people, making sure she always had someone covering them as she moves to the front as much she can, hoping her skills with her old 'family' would come in handy and help to hide them in the crowd.
*Stealth +14*

---

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-14 14:59:55)

You are quick to grab the little girl and rush further into the crowd. Pushing your way through you manage some progress. The crowdâ€™s current begins to take you, moving you towards the check point.
The trooper fires, again he hits another within the crowd. A woman falls to the ground, her cover stopped another shoot this one meant for you.
Ducking and weaving through the crowd you can see the trooper scanning the crowd for another shoot at you.
Within the next side street you notice a trooper fighting off several rioters. The only trooper stationed to that street has hands full giving you an opening.

*That's it!* With the thought in her head, Tar'ja runs; arms locking around the girl on her back to keep her steady she tries her best to keep low and run to and past the lone guard.

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-18 09:39:12)

Running into the next street you find it empty of everything but debris. The sounds of the riots can be heard all around its like the whole city went into chaos. More explosions shake the ground slightly. These are smaller explosions possible in combat or precision bombing.
The sirens are abruptly silenced replaced by a woman's voice. "This is the current officer in charge! Effective immediately preemptive use of lethal force is not authorized. Any further incidents are being recorded and will be investigated. Sentences up to and including execution." The message begins to repeat itself.
Your instincts remind you that this street will not stay empty for long. Patrols will check this street at some point you must keep moving. Beside you the little girl has stopped crying her tear drying on her cheeks. She stands waiting for your direction. Mental you roll your eyes "Damn how did this happen?"
You continue towards the dock section of town, its not far now only a few more blocks to go. Running to the next street you catch a glimpse of a spherical shadow. Running past a shop you see in the windows reflection a small dark probe droid hovering about 10 meters off the ground trailing your movements. Its an older model droid on used commonly by imperials.

## Re:Fate

### **zerah** (2008-11-18 10:11:24)

Tar'ja narrows her eyes at the reflection *why the hell is it following me..* continuing their run she doesn't release the girls hand. The lilac twi'leks mind shifts for a minute to the woman she wasn't able to get to, it had to be the mother which ment the girl was alone now.
A lone little girl of their race was never good, she wasn't going to let her end up down the wrong road; but first things first "move in front of me, slow to a walk..good...stop now." once they were stopped she makes motions of checking the girl over, kneeling down and turning the girl to face her as though looking to a wound though she was really undoing her blaster slowly.
Once it's in her hand she waits just a moment before standing, spinning, taking aim at the droid and firing quickly.
*aim at the droid; 1d20+3 3d6+3 weee I suck at shooting*

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-21 09:03:41)

The announcement continues "This is the current officer in charge! Effective immediately preemptive use of lethal force is not authorized. Any further incidents are being recorded and will be investigated. Sentences up to and including execution." and then begins again.
Unaware of the droid the little girl follows your instructions with a confused look on her face. After all at the moment you are her only hope, you or the imperials. As you reach for your blaster the you can hear the droid frame opening a concealed side door. From the reflection its a hidden hold out blaster it must have seen your movements.
Spinning around you snap off a quick shot trying to surprise the droid out of its advantages. Your shot hits the probe droid square in the imperial insignia. The little hovering droid try`s to maintain its altitude while small panels pop off it. In a trail of dark smoke the probe droid plummets to the ground. In a smash that scatters parts over the street the little droid is down.

Quickly putting her blaster back in it's holder Tar'ja grabs the girls hand and starts off running again "Come on little one, I won't let them hurt you. We'll get to the docks and see if we can get on a ship out of here."

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-25 11:50:43)

The little girl lets out a low sob â€œOk.â€ Looking around you are making good progress toward the local docks. After several more side streets and a few games of hide and seek from trooper patrols you can see the space port.
Imperial troops are spread out everywhere, columns of citizens are being marched inside administration buildings. The ports tower proudly displays imperial flags hung in victory. Trios of Ties circle patrol routes over head.
Beyond the gates and port administration buildings you can see clusters of ships. Most are large transports bulky mass transit liners used for commercial transportation for a fee they could get you anywhere in the galaxy. There are some clusters of smaller personal transports among them as well.
From inside the case you can hear a beep followed by a low muffled voice â€œFather? Father are you there? Its me â€¦. It Sia, we are waiting inside the ship for you. Please hurry father.â€

---

## Re:Fate

### **zerah** (2008-11-25 15:15:17)

Tar'ja kneels down slightly and pulls the girl back onto her back. Letting them move quicker. "42T, Keep an eye out for it." Glancing between the buildings and the guards, the woman sticks to the shadows as much as she can, running when able and being generally careful as she makes her way to find the ship, that voice from inside the case attached to her sounded like a little girl, she wasn't sure what happened to that drifter but the news would not be welcomed. *Hope they take us out of here though..* she thinks to herself.

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-01 11:40:05)

Making good time towards the port you can see a few obvious ways inside. The steady stream of citizens crowding into the buildings or try to sneak past alert troopers with a kid on your back. The case has stopped talking which will make it easier for you to move silently.
As you continue between the buildings you notice the side streets are empty as are many of the buildings themselves. The little girl hangs on tight, under the circumstances she has held together really well. Ducking behind a dumpster you avoid another patrol of troopers, you can hear the echo of their unified march getting further away.
((Mind you I posted two possibilities by no means are they the only options for you, only the options you can see with your perception check easily. ))

## Re:Fate

### **zerah** (2008-12-01 14:10:48)

Tar'ja shifts the girl on her back slightly, to help her to be more comfortable while making it easier for her to keep her on her back. Looking around she sighs, the side streets were looking promising, poking her head out from behind the dumpster the twi'lek takes another glance around hoping for a more promising route to where they needed to get to.
*Perception +8, Stealth +14 taking another look to see if I can see another way to where the ship is. You said those two were the ones I could see with that check so maybe I'll get lucky =P*

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-03 10:37:20)

Ducking into another side street you have closed the distance, only one street separates you from the administrative buildings and the port beyond. Running around a corner you narrowly avoid another patrol only to run head first into a lone trooper.
Exiting a building into your alley â€œThis is TK-4712 alpha four all clear.â€ The trooper taps his comlink off just as you come skiting to a halt in front of him.
â€œHalt, you are to report to processing. This will all be over shortly.â€ The trooper tightens his grip on his rifle as he stares at you waiting for compliance.

## Re:Fate

### **zerah** (2008-12-03 17:37:30)

One would not know how many curses ran through the womans mind at the troopers words. Processing?? processing for what?! She felt cornered and a cornered anything was never good. Still, she had a child on her back and needed to remain...calm.
"We're late for a flight." she heard herself saying, giving the trooper a desperately panicked look of someone late and scared, with the commotion going on it shouldn't be out of place for a woman to be terrified for her 'daughter' "I must get there quickly, please, we're very late and she's growing tired."

## Re:Fate

â€œEveryone is late for a flight. Move along no one is flying anywhere until the ban is lifted.â€ The trooper motions to the main street with his rifle. â€œI will escort you two into processing.â€
The trooper stands waiting for your compliance. Tilting his head you can tell that the trooper is receiving a communication. â€œOrder twenty one. Understood sir!â€ The trooper then ends his com link with a tap and raises his weapon to fire on you.

*Oh you have got to be kidding me.* she couldn't believe it she had a kid on her back and he had suddenly gone from nice guy to I'm going to shoot a possible mother and daughter for whatever the hell that order was. Perfect.
Even in all her musings her hand had moved as quickly as possible to her weapon to unhook and draw it with one hand while the other went to knock his rifle away from them. She just needed time to get her blaster up and fire.

## Re:Fate

With one hand reaching for your blaster the other jets out towards the troopers rifle. In a blur of motion you take the trooper completely off guard. Not expecting any resistance the trooper stands stunned at the fact that you are now holding his rifle.
The trooper lunges at you going for his rifle in your hands. The little girl slides off your back in the movement, but lands safely on the ground.
You manage to turn just as the trooper reaches for the rifle. The maneuver throws him off balance. Your swing and the troopers off balance stance gives you an opening to fire. Behind you the little girl rushes for cover behind a dumpster.

Tar'ja knew deep down, that she couldn't kill him in front of the girl, that was wrong but just as she knew that, she knew if she didn't he'd call for back up and they'd be screwed. Logically, she did what she thought best, if you can't kill them, use them. Pulling his gun from she moves her blaster to his chest "You are going to help me and my girl get to our ship or I'll drop you here.

The trooper stands there staring for a moment. His shaded helmet visor gives no clue to his intentions. Around you the explosions seem to have stopped but the carnage continues. You here rifle fire all around you, screaming crying. Its like all hell broke loose.
The troopers shoulders slum having come to his dissension and merely says "I have my orders." Lunging at you the trooper intends to continue your conflict unarmed.

Tar'ja gave something akin to a growl, she didn't want to kill the guy...well...she did, but it wouldn't be right. He seemed like he really didn't want to hurt them but orders were orders..she remembered orders...damn things. "Sorry about this then." she flicks the switch on her blaster to stun, and shoots, she didn't want to kill him...but she couldn't let him stop them either.

## Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-29 12:52:17)

The storm trooper lunges at you intent on completing his orders. With a swift flick and squeeze of the trigger your shot hits the trooper. The energy from the blast sends blue arcs his white but its unclear of its effectiveness.
The trooper swings high with a right hook. His aim and your quick reflexes result in an over head swing that meets nothing but air. Acting quickly you let another shot out hitting the trooper square in the chest. The trooper falls to the ground hand outstretched towards you.
The little girl wide eyed and shocked whimpers out â€œWhy is this happening?â€
On the street you hear the sound of more troopers marching in your general direction.

Tar'ja curses quietly, searching for a key card or anything that might help them get through faster, before going back to the girl and picking her up as she had before; with the girl on her back and holding her legs and runs towards the hangers "He's not dead, only knocked out. He'll wake up in a while and be fight save a little pain in his chest. I don't know what's going on but we're going to get out of here."

Searching over the trooper you are disappointed when you do not find a key card. You do discover a frag grenade his armor, his rifle which you have and a utility belt.
The little girl nods at your reassurance and the two of you duck back into the alley as another wave of troopers passes through the street. With the streets clear again you are able to continue.
Several of the ports administrative buildings loams before you. Once bustling with activity now dead silent. Where before there where guards posted your scans of the area show none. Inside the buildings the lights flicker and spark making it difficult to see within. Beyond these buildings is the maintenance way and landing pads after that. Ships of all sorts and sizes.

Glancing around a moment as they run the twi'lek begins to wonder just what happened.  What happened to all the people, the soldiers...the...the people...  Shaking her head slightly to clear her thoughts, *no thinking of what happened right now; right now…right now we need to get to that ship*  Picking up her pace Tar'ja heads towards the landing pads, keeping a watchful eye to the buildings while trying to keep to the shadows as much as possible.

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2009-01-15 14:09:43)

Quietly you lead the little girl through the rest of the alley and quickly across the street. Taking cover behind an abandoned speeder car, scanning the area you see no signs of pursuit no sign hat anyone saw you.
Now closer to the main terminal building you have your first real look inside. Instantly you cover the girlâ€™s eyes. Some in piles others shot as they fled bodies litter the terminal floor. The empire is no killing there own many citizens lay dead inside. Keeping the girls eyes covered to crouch closer to the building looking for a way past. Inside the terminal you can see mobile walkways check points and several side rooms.
In the doorway of one of the side rooms you see a lone female officer. From any angle she is startlingly attractive slim and yet shapely. She moves with a catlike almost liquid grace, nothing predatory simply casual ease. Skin pale like cream & sleek straight black hair bobbed jaw length provides a stark contrast to eyes that match the color of the glaciers on her home planet of Varlbrindal: A sharp light-ice blue. 51kg 1.6m. The Imperial uniform, & her other clothes, hide most if not all of her movements altering what is passively noticeable to something dramatically androgynous by comparison.
The woman enters the room then pauses. Her attention drawn completely on the room, it would be a simple matter to sneck through the building past her.

Tar'ja watches the female with interest, *strange that one…it was a female wasn't it?  Nevermind that, have to get past her..it.*  
Looking to the girl she crouchs down "Little one we're going to be moving again, nearly there now alright?  I want you to keep as silent as you can and keep your eyes closed.  If you open your eyes, you lose the game.  If you keep them closed until I say you can open them, then you win and I will get you a sweet at the next port alright?" 
Gently moving her to her back she waits for the girl to be settled before starting forward quietly, moving to the shadows.  She keeps her attention on the woman and the exit.

Beyond the administration building a low roar starts to build. Sirens begin to blare out warnings. From somewhere inside the city blaster fire streams high overhead, aiming at the area above the landing zones. The ships are taking off, a lot of ships are making a break for it.
The little girl slowly nods to you then with all the might she can muster closes her eyes shut. Slowly and silently you enter the building. Inside you find no signs of guard only the imperial officer on the second floor. Carefully you move through the mess of corpses, so many dead.
On the second floor you maintain a watchful eye on the officer. You hear sobbing and at first believe it may be the little girl. A closer look at the officer has her still inside the same room now sobbing on her knees. Continuing you make it through to the rear exit. Through the windows you can see several ships launching. Some taking hits from anti-aircraft fire. On the landing a few stormtroopers try to maintain control. But are limited to firing on the escaping ships.

Tar'ja couldn't believe the luck of the day, honestly something was out to get her for something she'd done in the past.  Then again maybe killing and stealing probably added to this..karma.  No matter need to keep going *Too close to stop now..*  Moving forward more, keeping to the shadows as best she can she moves towards the landing number that she needed to get to.

More and more ships are taking off now. All around people rush to one of the many ships still on ground trying to escape the current chaos. Some are turned away as the ships reach capacity, others force there way onboard. A few smaller transports crash under the anti-air craft fire.
Scanning the large open area no one pays any attention to you or the little girl. Running past several landing zones you continue on racing to your destination. Docking bay 42T thatâ€™s what he said, something shabby? So many ships what was that old fool talking about.
Finally you reach a series of private docking bays stopping just at the entrance for 42T. Around you the locals battle to escape the planet. The empire continues its assault on the populace.

Tar'ja pants slightly as they finally reach the right docking bay and moves quickly inside "You can look now little one, you won the first part of the game, now the second...We're looking for a ship with the word Shabby in the name, it's the second part of the name.  If you find it first you win alright?"  She talked while she moved, what could the first part have been? *something shabby…the..Glorious Shabby? Tch..nothing Glorious would have the name shabby in it..*  Still, the lilac twi'lek moves quickly though slow enough to at least try and see the names on the ships; it had to be here...they wouldn't have taken off without waiting for that old human and the thing on her wrist..right?

At the mention of winning the game the girl giggles â€œLetâ€™s go take a look inside!â€ The girl skips over to the nearby service door. Stopping she taps the panel. â€œItâ€™s unlocked!â€ The door opens to an unlighted hanger bay. The roof is currently closed and the only source of light comes from the open service door.
Inside the door another panel is easily found. Clicking the panel you adjust your eyes as the lights flicker on. The little girl shouts out as she points excitedly at a battered and dated YT-450a. â€œI win! I found it!â€ A few crates line the sides of the hanger but otherwise the hanger is sparse. Along the side of the ship orange writing labels it the Not to Shabby.
The ships ramp is closed but you can see a human girl no older then sixteen looking out the view port. She gives you an angry glare, the ships single cannon turret turns and lowers in your direction. Over a PA system a familiar girlâ€™s voice can be heard. â€œWe have no room onboard go away!â€ You have heard her voice once before though then it was muffled by the case bound to your wrist.

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2009-01-30 19:34:13)

Tar'jas eyes widen at the cannon, grabbing the girl and moving her behind herself holding the case attached to her wrist up "Hey I'm a friend!! Some old man told me to come here and put this thing on my wrist to bring here!!"  Hell, couldn't things go easy for her at all?  Really now... "I heard your voice coming from inside this thing! Put the cannon down....." she sighs "please?" she hated having to beg, or even sound like she was begging.  All the while she was moving back slightly wanting to at the least have a place to push the girl away.

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-03 12:01:18)

The girl must not be alone you can see her lips moving as she mutes the PA system. The little Twi`lek girl gulps as you push her behind you. She clings closely behind you finding some comfort with the cover you provide.
Outside you can hear another wave of ships taking off. You also hear more anti-air craft fire.
The PA system crackles to life again. The human girl once again announces her demands. â€œWhere is he?â€ You can hear a muffled argument from inside the cockpit but can not make out the voices or what is being said. â€œI do not know how you got that case but itâ€™s ours. Leave the case and go.â€

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2009-02-03 12:27:17)

A sigh escapes her, at least they were talking instead of shooting "I don't know, but when he pushed me to leave so he could distract the troopers there was an explosion.  I don't think he made it."  she had a bit of regret to her voice for the person, it wasn't going to be easy to hear that someone they cared for was probably dead.  "As for the case I can't get it off, I don't have a key."  She sighs "look he said something about For Sia when he went off to make the distractions and was going on about Rebels."

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-06 12:30:11)

The PA system squeals as the girl screams far too loudly into the mic. â€œWhat did you do to my â€¦â€
You can hear some muffled arguments as another girl tries to make her own point. â€œShe might be able to help us we need that case anyway.â€
The first girl replies â€œWe donâ€™t know her or what she did to my father!â€
The unknown girl continues â€œWe have no choice we have to go he, your father told us to and she has the case.â€
The arguing is replaced by a few minutes of silence. â€œI am Sia. Put your hands up and I will lower the ramp.â€ You can tell be her voice that the girl had been crying. The ramp lowers and two children wave you over. One a short blonde with blue eyes her face dirty. The other a little younger and also dirty, it looks as though they have been staying inside the ship alone for at least a few days.   
The little blonde raises a blaster pistol which looks two sizes too big in her hands. her hands shake as she says â€œI am Sia, donâ€™t try anything funny and bring over the case.â€

## Re: Fate

### **zerah** (2009-02-06 21:03:04)

they're children!? blasted children?!!?  Old man you left out a lot.  Tar'ja couldn't believe it, she was sent to find children, could they even fly the blasted ship?  She didn't have much choice, so she put up the hand with the case, the other still holds the girl to her "Come on little one...hopefully they'll get us off this planet.."  She moves slowly looking to the girl with the blaster "You don't need to point that at me little one...I'm not about to fire on someone I was sent to find.  I'm not imperial..and I want this thing off me as much as you want it." 
She moves slowly to the ramp, all the while her eyes are trained to the girl and aware of keeping the little twi'lek behind her to keep her safe.  Once at the ramp she holds the case arm forward while walking up, moving now towards the other unarmed child, presuming this would be the one to get the case off.  Rather than risk the twi'lek girl being open to an attack, Tar'ja shifts so that her front is always to the blaster rather than presenting an opening.

## Re: Fate

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-10 11:08:06)

The two make no attempt to stop you as you get closer. The little blonde girl Sia stands still shaking with her blaster pointed at you. Slowly the blaster lower and the girl falls to her knees in tears â€œWh what happened to my daddy.â€ Sobbing the girl runs back inside leaving the blaster on the ramp.
Picking up the blaster you stow it in your pack. The other girl waves a key pass at you â€œI can remove that if you want.â€ She points at the case. â€œIt is our only way off, and now without Sia`s father to pilot the ship we are stuck here Outside all we have heard is blaster shots. We have been too afraid to look outside, Sia`s father told us to leave if he did not come back but we donâ€™t know how.â€  She unlocks the case allowing your wrist some amount of comfort. â€œMy name is Llyl Chias and we are alone now, will you help us?â€
She reaches for the case and opens it. Inside a small computer blinks with various lights, a navigation computer. The ship â€œNot too Shabbyâ€ is just that a modest transport in fair condition. As you enter the ship llyl grabs you by the hand and pulls you into the cockpit. She inserts the small nav-computer and the ship begins to power up. â€œThe computer is preprogrammed with the coordinates to a safe house. If we can make it there we should be ok. Your friend will have a place to stay if she needs one.â€
A few moments later the hanger bay ceiling opens and you begin your accent. Outside another wave of ships are making their run as well. Mixed into the mess of assorted ships you manage to avoid the anti-aircraft fire. Once in orbit the navigation computer begins to auto calculate the hyper jump. In high orbit you can see a large imperial star destroyer, its command center a smoldering hole. With no signs of pursuit the ship enters hyper space the computer reads destination Tatooine with a day count down.

Tar'ja sits at the helm in the cockpit, she didn't need to do much now that they were going on on their way still she felt better, they were away from the planet, she had managed to save the little twi'lek; now though, she was in charge of three little ones. 
Sighing, Tar'ja stands and stretches her back deciding to see how the girls were doing, and wanting to make sure her little girl (as she started to think of her) was getting along alright with the other two. 
Walking down the hall she looks around for the others, it was a general time to kill time and wait.

The trip is short you spend your time watching the auto pilot and trying to comfort the children. Sia spends most of the trip to herself. Though the trip is only a day the circumstance of babysitting children makes that day go on forever. They are well behaved enough itâ€™s just completely foreign to you line of work. Despite the mess onboard you are able to find and prepare a simple meal which you all share quietly together.
You shake your head at the chaos you left behind and are thankful that none of the kids has asked you why it happened. How could you answer such a question, a question you have no answer to yourself.
Alone in the cockpit you sit relaxed across the two chairs as the ship comes out of hyper space above Tatooine. Wreckage litters the area around the dull tan planet. Twin suns blaze down creating a barely hospitable desert world. From your travels you know there is a small imperial presence but the planet is rules by the Hutts. Outside of the imperial laws most anything goes on worlds like this you know first hand to be cautious.
The navigation sensors plot a course to an area just outside the port city of Mos Eisley. In high orbit a single star destroy patrols the area, but otherwise ignores your approach to the planet. Sia enters the cockpit wiping tears from her eyes. â€œI wanted to thank you for getting us this far. My father chose wisely when he trusted in you.â€ The girl turns and looks to the planet. â€œWhen we land we should be safe all will be better from here on out.â€

*weird I thought I posted..*
"I'm glad he did really...hopefully this hero thing will make me feel as though I've truly accomplished something greater in life then what I have done."  Tar'ja glances back to the girl, sitting back in her seat as she was, one leg crossed over the other, idly playing with a leku "There is a safe place for us to be? hopefully out of the eyes of the hutts and the imperials?" 
Glancing back out the glass to the planet she hums "I want to make sure the little one won't be put into slavery..." she grins wryly "suddenly went from not liking kids to being protective of one...strange..." she seemed to be talking to herself at this point, all the thoughts that had been going in her head now coming out "Maybe she'll be able to stay with me, least I can keep her safe.."

## Re: Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-18 11:18:14)

You descend into Tatooine`s atmosphere with only a moderate amount of shipping traffic. Closing in on the port city of Mos Eisley you have received no landing hails no ship registry authentication requests. Mos Eisley itself is little more then a random collection of parts and material cobbled together to form a small city. The back water locals use every available means of tech available from repulsor speeders to beasts of burden all mess into the market streets.
You circle the city once before finding the random farm steadâ€™s just outside of town. The navigation system guilds you to your destination, a modest moisture farm as indicated on the display. Setting the ship down softly the engines stir clouds of dust as they power down. Several small individuals run towards the ship all shielding their faces from the blast of dust.
Unsure of what to expect you lower the ramp the children gather behind you. The ramp thumps to the ground and several children excitedly greet you at the ramp. The children become even more excited as they see they little ones you have with you. Squealing the children shout for them to come and play with them.
A short hairy woman approaches you as the girls all run off to play. She has a short muzzle snout dark eyes and short brown fur all over. You do not recognize her race but she looks friendly and other then a tool belt she is unarmed. â€œHello there stranger. Come in com in you must be tried from your travels. Is Cant with you?â€ the woman motions for the farm house â€œMy name is Dosenna and yours?â€

## Re: Re:Fate

### **zerah** (2009-02-18 12:09:30)

She wasn't sure what to make of this situation, it seemed friendly enough...the children seemed tame and unarmed...not that it doesn't stop her from holding back her little one to check her over one last time and give a warning of 'be careful' before letting her go and play. If this place was a nice as she was hoping, it would be grand for the little one to be able to play with children without worries.
Tar'ja watches the woman come to the ramp, meeting her halfway and nodding to her politely "Cant...is the man you were expecting with the 2 human children..he..well..he sent me in his place; I can only presume him gone to the higher plane." Stepping more towards the other womans side to look to the house and back again "You will have to forgive me, the ship may have landed here but after how we were able to leave the planet I am...cautious. What is this place, and..forgive the rudeness but what are you?"

## Re: Re:Fate

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-23 15:53:03)

The woman looks saddened by the news. She looks past you as if remembering something and for a moment does not answer your question. Then suddenly snaps back and in an attempt to lighten the mood changes the subject and answers you. â€œThis is an orphanage. We try our best with what little we have to raise these kids right and provide a proper schooling.â€™
The woman walks you to the ledge of the farm house. Built into the ground for the cooler climate within the ground you look over a common area. A few meager possessions are scattered through out the open floor a few benches serve as a class room while an older model protocol droid gives lessons to several other children.
Looking around you can tell that these people do not seem to have much and pose little threat to you or your little friend. The children seem happy despite the living conditions. Dosenna turns to you and smiles. â€œMake yourself at home we can at least offer you a meal.â€
The sound of a clanking cart grabs Dosenna`s attention. â€œStay make yourself comfortable I will see to our new guests.â€ The cart stops and Dosenna introduces herself. â€œAh welcome back Bandous I have your room ready.â€
