# [Secrets of the Ghost Star] 001 - Ghost Star

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-07 17:35:13)

The commandeered Lambda-class shuttle *Temperance* drops out of hyperspace after a three day flight. After a moment to take stock, you realise to your collective annoyance that your navigation was flawed and youâ€™ve dropped out short of the rendezvous point. Making another jump will take a few hours, and your contact wonâ€™t be happy about your tardiness.
It is then that you notice the moon. According to the star charts there shouldnâ€™t be one here, and thereâ€™s no planet nearby. It floats alone in the depths of space. Curious, you fly a little closer to investigate. Only then do you make a connection, and someone voices the thought going through all your minds in a disbelieving whisper:
â€˜*Thatâ€™s a Death Star*!â€™
â€˜Itâ€™s impossible, how can they have made another so soon?â€™
â€˜Weâ€™d better get out of here...â€™
You try to move away, but to your horror the *Temperance* is held in the Death Starâ€™s tractor beam. Worse, a flight of starfighters is closing the distance with your shuttle. Unable to maneuver, you are sitting ducks as the fighters circle you. They arenâ€™t Imperial craft, at least not that you recognize. In fact, youâ€™ve never seen their like before.
Still moving in formation, the fighters come in on your aft and fire, their precision shots damaging the Lambdaâ€™s ion engines even as they deftly avoid retaliatory fire from the aft-blasters. Your hearts sink. Without the engines, any wild hopes you still retained of escaping are crushed.
The fighter flight leaves you now, returning ahead of you back to the Death Star. You can do nothing but wait, anticipating the fate that awaits you on the moon-sized station.
This worry soon gives way at the forefront of your minds to surprise: For a reason you cannot fathom, the docking bay you are drawn into is completely empty besides yourselves and your shipâ€¦

Ben moves to the hatch opening it he walks out into the bay. Drawing his blaster he looks around. " Where is the greeting party. This place should be crawling with Troopers and Techs." " And what was with those fighters the Emps come up with something new while we where in hyperspace."

Despite having had plenty of time to be sure his equipment was fully checked and ready for the inevitably doomed fight that was sure to follow, Tanis is just re-checking the straps on his jumpsuit again while peering out of the 4th external viewcam from his position by the forward exit ramp in the shuttle.
"Doesn't make sense. Those weren't Imperial fighters that disabled us, and no troopers to finish the job or capture us. Very wrong it is."
The former merc and now full-time rebel looks back at the other passengers with a dark frown. "I have to suggest we try to repair the engines and take off without leaving the ship at all, if we can."

Sitting at the controls Isshkazza powers down the ship and continues to ready the ships systems for a diagnostic. "Roooarrgh ur roo wa." The tall wookie ensures he has all his gear, readies his bowcaster for the worst and follows the others out of the ship wanting to inspect the damage. "Ah wu ohhaag hag roo nngrarrr uaarga roo awa."

*I don't need to understand Shyriiwook to know Isshkazza dislikes this as much as I do.*
"I don't think the ship is operational after the damage it took. We need to find a suitable hiding place quickly. We're sitting ducks in this landing bay and Imperial troops will certainly be here soon. This is a Death Star after all."
*A Death Star. How could it be? It was destroyed at Yavin by Skywalker. They couldn't have made another this quickly.*
Saden quickly checks his gear and performs a search of the shuttle for any useful gear before exiting out into the landing bay.

Vannara remains fairly calm. At least, she is hiding her discomfort well. One painted eyebrow arches upwards as Ben walks out into the bay, before she turns to Tanis. "I believe it is a little late for that suggestion," the twi'lek states calmly.
Considering a moment, she moves to the hatch opening to peer out of it. "Let us look at this with a bit of logic. Those were not Eyeballs, and there are no techs or men to greet us. This is -not- an Imperial station. Which is bizzare, certainly. We should investigate this, at the very least. Destroy this before the Imperials find it and use it is the most ideal. Now, the longer we wait in here, the more likely that something 'bad' will happen to us as we are more likely to be found. My suggestion is to discover what this is, and what is going on, then we can rturn to fix the engines and plan how to destroy it once we have that information."

"Well if we are going to find a way of this thing, we might as well find a way out of here frist." Ben reaches into his belt and pulls out a glow rod and switches it on. Then starts moving further ahead in to the bay. "Anybody see a door around here?"

"If you are correct in assuming that this isn't run by Imperials then let's not be too quick to destroy it. Perhaps we can form an alliance with the current owners, or at least find out how they came by Imperial technology. I for one would love to meet anyone who can steal a Death Star from under the Emperor's nose. We may even be able to use this giant hunk of junk in the rebellion."

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-08 14:03:45)

A muted grump emits from Tanis's chest in reply to Vannara's observations. He frowns darkly and steps down the ramp of the shuttle to present himself as more of a target than Saden. Crouched to ensure he has the best vision of the bay around them as he decends, his carbine is out and in hand. Not unusual for him to assume someone will attempt to kill Vannara and Saden, or all of them. It's his job to keep them alive after all.
"At least the Wookie agrees with me." Tanis follows that with the smallest hint of a smirk back up the ramp at Isshkazza before his attention goes back to scanning the bay. Looking at the damage to the ship can be for others.

Yvanus sits polishing the long barrel of his blaster rifle, seemingly uncaring to the crew's current predicament. It is a long, silent moment until he finishes the task and looks up to see where the others are scrambling. The imperial crest on the left side of his face ripples slightly as he frowns and chews pensively in thought.
Rising languidly from his seat on the shuttle's floor, he slings the sniper rifle over a shoulder and sidles down the boarding ramp. With each step he moves deeper into the shadows afforded by the docking bay, until he reaches the bottom of the ramp and is nearly completely obscured.
"A Death Star silent as the Black. There's an irony there." Yvanus shoots a long stream of spittle off to the side of the shuttle before stalking his way along the along the shuttle bay's shadows, scouting the place out.

Avoiding Yvanus's spit, Saden exits the shuttle having taken any easily carried supplies. Covered by Tanis, Saden begins searching the landing bay for anything out of the ordinary, and more importantly an exit.
*Door. There has to be a door.*

Isshkazza steps off the ramp to the empty landing bay gives Tanis a nod, then checks over the ship as the others talk. "Wua oodr ur muaahh oarrgh roog um god, um wuahhha ah agaaha ag ouw maahum mua ura muaarg ag kouras." I large dark Wookie growls in protest then scratches its head looking at the damaged ship "Um aag uah uaaharrgh ag ahum abukk Ruaah gwy."

The hangar is well-lit, and entirely empty of personnel or other starships. The walls and deck are lined with power charging sockets, and the directional markings etched into the deck and used to aid landing craft are illuminated by lamps on the sides of a raised control tower on the rear wall. Access can be gained to the tower via a walkway that circles around the hangar's walls a significant height above you, connected to the "ground" floor by way of a lift on the left side of the hangar. Beyond the magnetic field behind you the stars can be seen.
Under the control tower in the far wall are several blast doors leading further into the station.

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

"Lets head for those blast doors, and see what we can find on the other side." Ben says moving in that direction.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-08 20:25:24)

Tanis is given cause to frown again at Isshkazza's comments. He does not remain where he is however, turning and starting to walk not toward the blast doors, but the lift that will grant access eventually to the control tower. If it works. "First thing first. That control room must have terminals. If we can get up there, we might learn more of what is going on." Or not going on, Tanis thinks to himself. Eyes keeping watch on the high areas of the bay, he moves to the lower lift to see if there is any power to get up to the walkway.

Isshkazza walks towards the lift looks down to Tanis"hrrrrrnnnn." With the bowcaster in hand Isshkazza does not wait to see is anyone is following him he just walks towards the lift. " ur ohma uma Ruhuwaa Roooarrgh ur."

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-08 20:37:51)

Tanis nods to his wookie friend. "Agreed. Everyone keep their coms open please, and together whenever possible." He goes about testing the lift for power and stability. Nothing overtly looks wrong but who knows what's happened to the equipment on this apparently automatic station?

That painted eyebrow arches again as the lekku dangling behind Vannara flick absently. "Very well," is offered with the hint of a sigh as she finally move to follow the more skilled 'mercinaries' of the group. She wasn't trained with a blaster pistol all THAT much after all.
Glancing around, the woman's indigo eyes try to take stock of the surroundings, her lips pursing with a faint Mmmmm. "The only reason I say to destroy it, is that whoever has this weapon is a threat to the Republic," One lekku taps Vannara's left arm as she continues to look around, before she starts striding for the most obvious exit. "Power of this magnitude should never be in one person, or one small group's hands. It is more dangerous and more corrupting than the Dark Side is rumored to be. Now, let us hurry. This quiet is … alarming."

### **ganthet** (2007-10-08 22:31:20)

" Well there is just one little problem with blowing this place up and that is we are on it." Ben says with a smile. " I intend to live a little longer." Ben turns and puts away the glo-rod and get out his security kit to open the doors. With his other hand he holsters his blaster and opens up his com link so he can be in communication with the rest of the party.

"So do I."
Saden follows Ben towards the blast doors, pulling his heavy blaster as he does. He covers Ben as he approaches the door. He also keeps an eye on his other crew mates as they head for the tower.
*Sitting in the landing bay is asking to be a target. There will be other computers.*

The lift seems operable to those checking it. As a matter of fact, it appears to be extremely well maintained.

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-09 11:43:39)

With the lift seemingly to be in good working order. Very good working order that is, Tanis steps onto it making room for the Wookie and Vannara. Waiting there, he looks to the others who seem intent on opening the blast doors to see what might wait for them on the other side. "Assuming they open, don't go too far. If they won't open we should be able to get things going from here. Stay alert down there too, this is *not* an abandoned station. That possibility keeps getting smaller and smaller."

---

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 11:57:52)

Reachoug out once inside the lift, Vannara runs a finger over the surface, before inspecting it for dirt or dust. "No, it most certainly does not appear to be abandoned," is offered with a faint distasteful wrinkling of her nose. "All the more reason to find out who operates this, why, and to shut it down and destroy it. We can no doubt set a TIMER for destruction long enough for us to get off this hunk of man-made metal floating in space," is drawled before indogo eyes look at the others outside of the lift.
And Vannara does something uncharacteristic.
"Be careful, and may the Force be with you," is stated JUST before the lift doors close, so no one can comment back in surprise.

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-09 12:07:56)

Isshkazza steps inside looks down to his two compainions, then looks for the control panel. With a few click Isshkazza activates the lift doors then the lift itself, heading for the control room level.

---

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-09 12:22:06)

Tanis does not respond verbally to Vannara's farewell to the others, but he does give a sidelong look at her. Following that with a look at Isshkazza and the smallest of shrugs. Then it is back to observing what he can. There might yet be sentients in that control tower, and they may not be very willing to be found out.

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-09 13:32:11)

When activated, the lift rises smoothly accompanied by a gentle hum, carrying you up to the gantry. The clanking of your feet on the metal walkway as you walk to the control tower sounds awfully loud in the cavernous silence of the hangar bay.
Atop the tower, a pair of dull-beige humanoid droids bustle about between consoles. They seem completely oblivious to your presence.
Meanwhile, one of the doors below (the left one) is easily opened and Ben steps out into an empty corridor that stretches off in both directions. The hall has a black floor, which is rather dusty. Angular footprints probably made by droids reveal a reflective surface underneath. Whatever made the footprints went into the hangar: There are some going in the opposite direction, but they look older, already beginning to fade under a veneer of dust. The walls and ceiling are a pale grey, near-white, and lined near the top with strip lighting that adequately illuminate the passage.
In both directions, the corridor appears to end - either dead ends or right-angle turns, it's too hard to tell from where Ben is. Bearing in mind Common sense dictates they probably aren't dead ends.

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 13:41:07)

Again that painted eyebrow arches on Vannara, this time upon seeing the droids that pay no mind to herself, the wookie or the human. The sound of the footfalls of the group echoing in the empty space draws another frown to the twi'leks lips. So unpleasing that noise is. Still she moves on, watching the droids for a moment, before pausing.
Turning, she smiles sweetly as she approaches the mechanical 'help.' "Ah, but a question for you, good workers," drawls the twi'lek woman, her lekku curling slowly in mid-air. "Who is the administrator of this fine station, so I might commend them on the work done here?"
((OOC: Why not see if the droids actually know and answer, eh?))

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-09 14:24:43)

Tanis, trying to keep himself more front and center than Vannara, finds the task as difficult as ever when she decides to talk pleasantly. Shifting on his feet the former merc works to assertain just what the droids are and holds himself ready for anything... Well maybe not ready for presentation of a birthday cake, but how likely is that?

"Besides, we'll need as much firepower as possible if we want to make it out of here alive."

"Well, we could explore a little ahead." Your probably right, we should wait for the rest." " I'l comm them and tell them what we found."

Yvanus slings his sniper rifle from over his shoulder, holding it in his hands with a familiar readiness. The scout moves into the seemingly-vacant hallway, making sure to disturb as little of the dust and tracks as possible. Taking note of just who and what has been passing into and out of the hangar, the young mandalorian moves with slow precision, reconnoitering both ends of the corridor.
"Not a small thermal exhaust port in sight. Whoever is in control of this behemoth isn't likely to take kindly to our blowing it up or requisitioning it. Looks like we're neatly nestled in the catcher's craw…" Yvanus trails off as he moves further away from the door, taking note of which hallway has been traversed most recently.

'Ah, but a question for you, good workers," Vannara drawls. "Who is the administrator of this fine station, so I might commend them on the work done here?"
The droids both turn their angular heads upward, red sensor lights blinking.
'<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">VOICE PATTERN NOT RECOGNISED. AUTHORISATION CODE REQUIRED.</span>' They say in unision with tinny, low quality vocalisation.
Just then your commlinks crackle into life. It's Ben, from downstairs.
'Guys, the blast door is open and there might be some droids moving around in here. Be careful.'
Meanwhile, Yvanus heads down the corridor to the right and peeks around the corner - nothing more interesting than a further expanse of corridor makes itself visible to him.

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 18:32:54)

Brows furrow in annoyance as Vannara glances at the droids momentarily. Then she sighs and turns to walk away with a wave of her hand, "They are not going to be helpful, gentleman. In fact, I think they are about to become hinderances. Thus, I shall move myself out of the way so you can do what you must do next," comes the twi'lek's drawl. After all, there is no diplomacy with such droids, merely deactivation of one form or another.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-09 18:41:33)

"Nice to see you are learning. But at least now we know these droids do answer to *someone*." Tanis's weapon slowly raises to a half-set position so long as the droids continue now to be paying attention to them. They could be programed to alert security or even attack themselves if the authorization code isn't forthcoming. "Isshy, I think we may want to go down now." Leaving the wookie to fire up the lift and lower the trio back down as Tanis also slowly lowers himself to one knee.

*Can we spread out any further? We're too thin to defend against any kind of attack.*
Saden activates his comlink, "Hey guys if you're done sightseeing we need to scram before we become permanent residents."

Yvanus heads down the other side of the corridor to looks around the corner. Again, he sees nothing. The corridor is as empty as the hangar bay.
Up at the control tower, the droids turn away and go back to their work, apparently not concerned about intruders provided they don't cause trouble. The party on the platform return to the hangar bay floor without issue.

"Very well, -I- am of no help here, certainly. Where shall we go next?[/colors]" the twi'lek directs to her human and wookie companion, slipping into the lift and waiting for it to go back down.

"Any way that gives us access to an unguarded terminal should be good. Though we are probably going to need to slice into the system to gain any kind of information." Tanis moves with the others into the hallway, left seemingly to be the 'right' way to go for now. His carbine does not get holstered yet either though it is held in only one hand at the human's side.

Ben shrugs and follows the Wookie. "Answers that question." " It is kind of weird to see only driods running around in here." I mean you would think that there would be some lives beings around here." Ben say walking down the staying on the right side of the coridor with blaster at he ready.

Yvanus stares flatly at the advancing rebel rabble as his attempt at a stealthy reconaissance is broken by the clatter of boots and the wookie's bounding strides.
"…And they wonder why we SpecForce operatives are such solitary creatures. Hallway and more hallway down here, and down the other passage. Seems you've selected this Nexu den, but its as good as any…"
The scout smiles a small, secretive small before taking off down the left hallway, his cryptic comment echoing slightly off of the recently-vacant corridor.

"I think our very arrival in the bay would have alerted whomever may be listening. Either we are expected, or there's nobody to expect us anyway." It's not quite as clear cut as Tanis makes it sound, but he does not make accomidation to his pace. Eyes panning forward one second then behind the next, it is still clear that he considers a late welcoming party to arrive from any angle a distinct possibility even now.

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-10 20:29:41)

Vannara simply turns a glance towards Yvanus from behind both the Wookie and Tanis. Wrinkling her nose, and considers throughfully, her lekku twitching this way and that. "We should simply pick a direction, or find a dataport that is … unoccupied, and call up the plans to this particular … station." The twi'lek's face distorts in distaste as she says the last few words, even her lekku seem to slide behind her to hide. "Before those of us not in the SpecForce get lost,'" she drawls as her indigo eyes fall upon Yvanus again.

You head down the left side of the corridor then turn right at the end. A short distance along is a door on your right. Further, the corridor stretches on for a great distance. What other doors there might be, or intersections, cannot be seen. The trail of droid footprints can still be seen along the corridor's floor, coming from further along. Of security measures and residents, there is still no sign.

After spending a split second considering the value of walking in the footprints of droids, Tanis decides against it. Instead he takes a slow walking position next to the left wall to continue down the hallway with the group and then hold position keeping an eye for trouble from those directions. No sign of life yet. If ever they will find more than maintenance droids who don't dust the floors very often. Doesn't take a small army to see about the door after all.

Isshkazza stops to ponder the door for a moment, looking for controls to open it. Seeing Tanis continue down the hallway, Isshkazza can not ignore his training. With a hand gesture to Ben and Yvanus to cover the sides of the door Isshkazza waits for them to take up positions before opening the door.

Watching the hallway, Tanis allows the others to deal with the door. Plenty of firepower there already and another gun would just risk hitting friends more than foes. As such, the human gunman simply holds his position a little away from the others keen on being ready in case someone or something comes into view/earshot from either direction of the hallway.

Yvanus takes a flanking position next to the door at Isshkazza's direction, nodding to the wookie when he is prepared. He takes on a pensive look as he mentally prepares himself for the task of clearing the room.
*"…Do wookies go bald? If they do is it an all at once thing, or are we talking a patch job here? Wonder if they make wookie toupees… Or better yet, toupees made out of wookie fur! Bet that's an untapped market. Going to have to look into that after this…"* 
The young mandalorian cycles through these thoughts while double-checking his rifle and equipment, giving the appearance of deep concentration before a possible battle.

Luckily, opening the door doesn't meet with any retaliation from either occupants or security. The moment the door slides open the lights within the room switch on, and it becomes clear that the room is used for storage of tools and supplies for maintenance and cleaning.
Tanis, moving further along the corridor, notices one of the strip lights in the wall ahead flicker then go out.

"Ah… the ever dangerous imperial storage closet. I know it well."
Yvanus shakes his head, as he lowers his rifle and takes a brief glance around the rooms interior. He stalks his way up the empty corridor, listening and looking for anything even more out of the ordinary.

Tanis, looking the other way takes a moment to tilt his head back over the shoulder toward his companions. "Let's not get on the subject of you and closests, Yvanus. In any case stay focused. We just lost a bank of lights down here. Might have maintenance droids here shortly." Still the human makes no moves away from his position, going back to watching both up and down the hallway.

The only things Isshkazza finds that could have a use are a selection of power tools clearly intended for use by maintenance crews. They are older models, not quite as efficient as some of the tools currently on the market, but still serviceable.
Meanwhile outside, Yvanus is first to hear a distinctive sound from further up the corridor - the hum of a repulsorlift system.

---

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 001 - Ghost Star

### **Anazider** (2007-10-13 16:53:39)

Yvanus cocks his head to the left, listening intently at the sound coming from further up the corridor. He frowns deeply to himself before motioning the others to silence, giving a hand gesture that most of those that have served as ground troops before would recognize as "hovercraft".
The absent-minded quirkiness the mandalorian had displayed before is gone in an instant, replaced by a genuine deadly calm. He begins a silent progression towards the origin of the sound, sniper rifle raised and held at the ready.
((Stealthing towards the sound))

Isshkazza grabs a few power tools to add to his tool kit, and exits the maintenance closet. Watching Yvanus sneak further up the corridor, Isshkazza takes this to mean that Yvanus knows something. His bowcaster ready Isshkazza stands outside the closet door ready to give fire if need be. Once again with hand signals Isshkazza motions for Tanis to take position opposite Isshkazza on the other side of the corridor another hand motion for Ben to take up a firing position on the floor, and lastly hand signals to Vannara to take cover behind him. Not really sure what any of these fellow rebels can do Isshkazza looks at Saden and shrugs his massive shoulders before focusing on Yvanus`s progress.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-13 19:37:48)

Not yet aware of whatever has Yvanus's attention, Tanis issues a tiny nod to Isshkazza already in position by sheer fortune. Even as the human scout makes his way toward the sound that triggered him, the blue eyed former mercenary continues to pay as much attention down the other end of the corridor as he does to where Yvanus is headed. It's never the one you see, or hear, that kills you. A lesson learned from his uncle. A now very dead uncle.

Ben lowers his blaster and smiles."Well, that was fun, I think the wookie is getting jumpy." Then Ben hears the sound of repulser lifts coming down the hallway. Ben jumps to the other side on the hallway and rasies his blaster towards the sound. "This place is just one surprise after another, aregular fun house."

"It is better to have a jumpy wookie, then a dead one falling on top of you," notes Vannara as she waits in the hall for the next course of action. An eyebrow rises at the declaration from Yvanus, and indigo eyes look at the closet. "I suppose it is too much to ask that the closet is comfortably large enough for all of us to fit into, isn't it?"

As Yvanus advances down the hallway, the sound of the repulsorlift gets louder and louder - everyone can hear it now. The scout has just reached an intersection when he realises that whatever is making the sound is right around the corner!
It bursts out into the corridor, a hovering droid with a humanoid top half but a repulsorlift instead of legs. Its yellow sensors twinkle brightly from its head, and a light built into its chest casts a glow on its brown chassis. The droid holds in its arms a strip light such as the ones that line the corridor, and turns to move towards the broken light. Finding Yvanus in its path it pauses, hovering in place.

Yvanus trains his longblaster on the repulsor-powered droid, preparing to pull the trigger at a moments hostility. He grunts to himself, standing aside to allow the droid passage as the young mandalorian is apparently blocking its way. While the machine is fixing the strip lighting, Yvanus keeps his rifle trained on it at all times.
"Perhaps it would be best if we followed this one. Lead us to a facility of some sort, yes?"

The droid remains in front of Yvanus several seconds longer, then turns around and hurries off along the corridor in the opposite direction, away from both the broken light and the corridor which it arrived from.

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-15 17:18:21)

Tanis eyes back up and down the hallway after focusing upon the maintenance droid. As expected and predicted. Very swift response times too. "They won't get aggressive on you anyway. But following this one once it's done may well be good. At least it'll give us *somewhere* to go. As opposed to just wandering these hallways alone." Rising from his previous crouch, it is becoming clear that he does not suspect storm trooper patrols or anything else threatening to come around the corner anytime soon.

There is a curious series of sounds, almost as though the owner of the voice is conferring with himself in low undertones. At one point, he growls. Finally he seems to comprehend the question, and raises his voice once more.
'A friend. You're not the only one trapped on this station. But you won't be trapped here much longer if you stay, because you'll be dead. Open up the shaft and follow me.'

Yvanus, not one to take dire warnings against death lightly, reaches down to open up the grate to the ventilation shaft. He does a brief sweep with the barrel of his blaster before lowering himself into the tunnel, landing gracefully.
"I doubt hostiles, or at least those without our best interests at heart would take the time to speak up. Especially from some hidden and well guarded a position. The spider doesn't warn the fly 'ware the web." Even still, the Mandalorian raises his sniper rifle and aims it at the first target he sees.

"Smart. Controlling the mouser remotely lets you guide wayward souls without threat of violence to your person or position. Still, you are a bit smaller and a lot *less* metallic than I'd imagine my eventual death to be."

As Tanis begins moving away from the shaft entrance, the unmistakable sound of marching feet is heard from the corridor. Looking back, those at the rear of the group can make out the legs of droids passing by on the other side of the vent.
The mouse droid hurries along the shaft at a pace difficult for you to match, but it never goes too far ahead, always stopping and waiting at junctions to prevent you from becoming lost. Its controller keeps their silence now, and you have only yourselves for company in the claustrophobic space within the Death Star's walls.
Several hours later, the droid stops before another vent, for which you are extremely glad. It "speaks" again.
'This is the exit. You're not far from safety now. If you wait here, we'll send out a guide to get you.'

Vannara tries to hide the groan, but it comes anyway and the moment she can, the twi'lek woman lays down in the too small space and stretches out. There is definitely a wince of pain on the woman's face and even her lekku are barely moving, as if they, too, could stand to crawl no further.
Now, hopefully, there will be a nice bath of some sort to soak in and draw out the pain of being cramped and crawling for HOURS! Vannara would even let the wookie join her at this point.

Yvanus waves a farewell to the little mouse droid as it departs, that hand going right back to bracing his sniper rifle as the small party of residents come a calling. He smiles at the Devaronian woman, but the muzzle of his blaster doesn't waver an inch.
"Quite the motley welcoming committee, if not all that warm. Mousey didn't say anything about our guide being well-armed and organized, but then again Mousey didn't have much to say. Where to?"
Yvanus waits for the new entrants to make their move first, before following after.

Saden emerges from the vent and feels the aches burn in his muscles. He watches as his comrades greet the welcome party. His blaster still rests in his hand.
*Too many people talking means not enough questions answered.*
Saden remains behind the rest, at a good vantage point to observe the newcomers with a keen scrutiny.

A shift in stance is Tanis's most vocal reaction to the newly arrived sentients. For while his carbine is not brought up to firing position, it rests in both hands ready to be engaged if needed. After all, this is a diplomatic situation as certain as ever there was one, and while men like himself are often the last word in diplomacy the situation does not require him yet.

Refraining from sighing in relief at being able to stand again, Vannara lets her indigo eyes fall over the motley crew of humanoids meeting them, her lekku twisting faintly with a curious twitch, despite the calm and controlled mask of her features. Her eyes drift over to the Twi'lek with the vibrosword, and her lips pull up into a sile as she speaks in her native tongue, > she assures, before looking back to the rest of the group.
A bow of her head is given and the Twi'lek woman steps forward, her arms spread wide, unthreateningly from her sides as she does so. "Greetings, friends. I am Vannara Lyr, and we were travelling to rendezvous with some business associates when we dropped out of hyperspace early. We did not have time to even realize what was happening before we were pulled aboard this station. And now, we are merely trying to discover out situation, and rectify it to a more amiable means for ourselves. I take it, you are not aboard this station of your own will, either. So, please, tell us your story and let us work together, my friends," is offered with a wide, serene smile.

'I am Alayva.' The Devaronian says in polite and patient tones. She then introudces each of her companions in turn, pointing to the Bothan, the Twi'lek, the man, and the woman: 'These are Vexx, Kar, Nom, and Ynna.'
She turns her attention to Ishhkazza, replying directly to him to demonstrate she understands his speech.
'We call this place the Ghost Star. As for the Empire... it has little authority here, not in this territory. We are representatives of the community of Gilded Cage, where we will take you if you will allow us.
Kar smiles thinly to Vannara, responding with his lekku rather than words: *I do not do so out of rudeness. There is much danger in this place.*

While the former merc checks his blaster carbine over, he speaks while not looking at anyone. "And that is only the start of the questions of course." Even so, Tanis makes no effort to actually speak those questions. Rather those eyes raise to look over the 'greeting party' once more, alert for any trouble.

Oh! It is so nice to have someone that can truly understand her around once more, and Vannara arches an eyebrow upwards at Kar, her lekku twitching back and forth, though in a slightly sinuous movement -- *Tell me all of it. It is imperative that you do so.*
A smile is given to the rest of the rescuing party, so to speak, but Vannara actually ... quiets now. Unless someone understands the twitching of lekku.

Tanis's lips quirk to a wry smirk, eyes flashing for only a second toward his fellow soldier. "That is why we are exactly where we are, Ben. Because we won't be discovered by anyone else." Those blue orbs finish out the rest of what he has to say while looking at the greeting party, that wry smirk still on his lips. "From right here, they can determine if we are a threat to them or not. And if we *are* a threat, they can deal with us without threat of being.. interrupted or giving away their safe-house. If we are not a threat, we are close enough to quickly be brought to their most secure hideout. So Ben… are you a threat to these people?" At last those eyes slip over to Voren again as well as sliding over each of his companions.

" Who me, no I am the most unthreating thing you will find." Be says with a smile. " I was just wanting not to be discovered by the army we heard alittle while ago." Ben turns to welcomeing party. "Ben Vor'en at your service, My skills at security are at your disposal."

*We are not the only prisoners on this forsaken station. Pirates, Imperials, criminals, and even beasts have found themselves brought aboard. If you're not careful what you do or where you go, you have to deal with security systems and droids. There have even been some unexplainable disappearances. Bluntly, you may be just another danger. If I put away my weapon for the sake of politeness I would not be much of a bodyguard.* Kar's lekku twitch and twine, his eyes focused on Vannara. Despite this narrowing of his focus everything about him appears tensed, ready to be unleashed at the slightest provocation.
Meanwhile, Alayva smiles.
'That's the sum of it, yes. We don't know who you are or what you do, you could be just another threat that we don't need residing with us here on the station. Or you might be friendly, in which case you'll be more than welcome among our number. Currently, you appear to be the latter.'
'They don't look too dangerous to me.' Vexx comments dismissively. 'Untrustworthy, but who isn't these days? Not threatening, though.'

## Re: 001 - Arrival on the Ghost Star

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-31 12:30:53)

Indigo eyes slide over her companions before Vannara turns quietly, silently back to Kar and the rest of the group that has 'rescued' them. She bows her head faintly, still saying nothing vocally, before sliding her gaze back to Kar once more, her turquoise lekku twisting and twining almost playfully. *An interesting and motley group, to be certain. We do not know the dangers of this station, obviously. And you do. We would appriciate your assistance in what must be done then. As for being another danger, it is not our intent to be a danger to you, or most anyone else on board.*
Vannara reaches up to brush hands over her clothing, as if finding a piece of lint that did not belong where it was, her stance shifting, since she aches so from all of the previous crawling. *We did not intend to find this place. We were to rendezvous with another group than yours, on a differnt ship, with far fewer droids. But yes, of course we can be dangerous. Just as anything can be dangerous when cornered. It is becoming clearer and clearer in my mind, that this place, needs to be destroyed. And you say there are more of you? Surely there were ships that you all arrived on.*
The female twi'lek looks to her companions, her lips never moving this entire time, as she seems to consider something before looking back to the others, and a gentle smile crosses her lips now as she bows her head to Alavya. "I do not see a need to be dangerous, when we can be friendly," she offers in smoothe tones as she finally speaks. And still those lekku twitch. *We will need to find those, see that they are repaired, get most to safety, then a select few of us stay behind to destroy the power core of this station, and flee if able. But in the end, so long as the job is done, and the majority of trapped inhabitants are evacuated safely … I can live with not escaping myself.*

"We had the makings of a wonderful debacle here, but you all had to ruin it with your diplomacy and good will. Sadness."
Yvanus lowers his rifle, keeping it in hand but not holding it in a readied position. He looks from each member of the Gilded Cage party to Isshkazza and back. The mandalorian frowns to himself, the facial expression stretching the imperial crest tattooed on the left side of his face.
"…And the approval of a Wookie. Its well known wookies can sense evil… and the lack of proper shampoos and conditioners. All right, I am convinced our doom is not immediately at hand, but the more we stand around discussing the finer details of our mutual entrapment, the greater the chances of something untoward happening to us."
Yvanus looks up the tunnel from where he and the other rebels initially came, before looking through the opening from where the welcoming committee originated. He finally settles on the Devaronian, deciding upon her as the de facto leader of this new group, since she spoke first.

For Tanis's part, he looks to be rather unconcerned with threats from either the Gilded Cage greeters or any roving patrols. The former mercenary proves that ease of situation by holstering his carbine in it's place at his thigh, the weapon making a fine countermeasure against the vibroblade hugging the opposite leg. "Your comedy routine still needs work, but you *are* improving." Tanis avoids using Yvanus's actual name for the moment, just in case.

At least I'm not getting shot at."* "Not to be rude or anything but have you come to a desition wheither we are a threat or not because the supinance is killing me, along with the bordum."

Alayva turns her gaze on Ben, appearance unruffled but an edge to her voice when she speaks.
'Any comment prefaced with "Not to be rude" is guaranteed to be so. You do not disappoint on that count.'
Vexx smirks, and Kar shuffles his feet. Nom and Ynna glance at each other then watch Alayva wearily. The Devaronian turns her back on Ben, saying:
'I shall forgive your lack of courtesy in light of the fact you've had a stressful day. In future, however, I would ask you to choose your words with more care. Come.'
She walks out of the room. Sharing signficant looks, Nom and Ynna follow her. Kar stays where he is, as does Vexx. The Bothan grins and gestures for you all to go ahead of them.

Tanis, after exchanging a look with Isshkazza elects to take the last position in line relative to his party. If there is to be any backstabbing done here, he wants the stabbing to be tried on him first. His own vibroblade can be brought into play quickly enough if needed, though he does not inwardly expect betrayal at this point.

Indigo eyes turn to peer at Ben, and a painted eyebrow arches upwards as the twi'lek woman just watches him, her lekku twining and twisting in 'colorful metaphors' that are best left untranslated. Kar, however, no doubt must surely have to stifle laughter at the words rolling off of the women's brain-tails.
Instead, Vannara moves, taking long strides to try to walk alongside Alayva. The moment she nears Ben to pass him, the twi'lik fixes him with a cold case and a sharp hiss of a whisper, "The next time you have the urge to pen your mouth, please do everyone around you a favor, and resist it. What comes out should only be heard in the vacuum of space." Pause. "Where it cannot be heard at all, of course."

Alayva and her companions lead you through the halls of the Death Star for a time until finally coming to a stop at a door no different from any of the others lining the corridor you are currently in.
Alayva activates her commlink, speaking into it with impatient tones.
'Would you mind opening the door for us, Fil? I know you can see us.'
Momentarily the door slides open, revealing another corridor beyond. A bearded human youth sits on a chair just beyond the doorway, a blaster pistol held idly in his lap. He grins.
'Sorry to keep you waiting, I was parsecs away.'
Alayva sniffs and sweeps past him, and Fil does his best to look apologetic but fails to completely remove the smile from his features. His brown eyes sweep over you and your companions as you walk through and he seems excited.
'Are the Council still in meeting?' Vexx asks, snapping his fingers in front of Fil's face to draw his attention.
'Ah... No. They're in the bar, talking to the visitors. The *other* visitors, I mean.'
'What?' Alayva exclaims. 'No other ships were brought in.'
Fil nods.
'They walked here from another sector.'
'Past security? The beasts? Bandits?'
'Seems that way.'
All the Gilded Cage natives share significant glances.
'Well.' Says Alayva. 'We should take you to the bar too, then. Unless anyone would like to freshen up first?'

"Sounds fine to me." "Though by your tone I could tell what these people did is impossiable, they shouldn't have been able to do this."

"Is there any reason to freshen up? Besides, I would be far too tempted to crawl into a little ball and sleep away the ache in my back" offers Vannara, as she turns and arches an indigo brow at Ben. Then she looks to Alayva, with a nod of thanks to Fil. "And yet, did we not just do the same?" she asks of her companion and the apparent leader of the group from Gilded Cage.
Lekku twitch slowly in spirals as the woman walks smoothely along. "How many other civilizations in other sectors are there?" she asks, frowning thoughtfully. '*This is going to take more coordination than I originally planned. Still, everyone needs off of this … place, and it needs to be destroyed. Yes, this will take a little more time.*' she offers to the other twi'lek silently.

'You landed in our territory.' Alayva explains. 'Things are not entirely safe in this area, but we have them, for the most part, under control. However, there are entire sections of this station that are death traps to the unwary. Unfriendly locals, strange manner of beasts, and security systems can all make victims of those who dare travel there. And many areas of the station have no power. Can you imagine how difficult getting anywhere in this place would be without electricity to run the lights? The doors? The elevators? As for other communities, we know there are some out there. As for how many, I couldn't say. It's a big station.'
Vexx guffaws.
'That's an understatement if ever I heard one.'
Kar, still at the back of the group, watches Vannara's lekku. He shakes his head slightly, then turns to Fil.
'Stop gawping and close the door.' He reprimands, causing Fil to splutter and protest.
'Hey-'
'I'll do it myself then, shall I?' The Twi'lek warrior cuts him off and reaches across to the wall nearby where the control panel sits, pressing a series of buttons to shut and secure the door.

"Ah… The wilderness beyond sounds rather delightful. You never know adventure until you find it at the tip of a Rancor's tooth."
Yvanus squints at the bearded youth, looking him over and the blaster pistol in his lap, before looking beyond him. He takes a moment to sniff at his armpit, frowning in contemplation to himself as if mulling over a splash of wine.
"As fresh as I am likely to get, I'm afraid. A particularly… vinegar-y vintage, yet robust." The mandalorian lopes along at the fore of his own group, keeping a watchful eye for any sign of further surprises.

Alayva leads you along the corridor to the bar. The bar itself is a somewhat sad affair, painted in the same grey and white shades as the rest of the station, it hardly has the friendly atmosphere a customer might hope for. Attempts have been made - blue-tinted light fixtures bathe the room in a cool glow, and a single plant (you assume it is either fake or bred to survive without natural light) sits by the door.
The bartender is a tall, middle-aged Zabrak man with a friendly face, a face that is currently radiating worry and concern. Bottles of alcohol are lined up behind him, representing all manner of colours, consistencies, and quantities. His hand rests on one of several pumps on the countertop, his fingers tapping nervously on the pump's handle.
At one of the tables sit a large party comprised of the Council and the visitors. Clockwise around one half of the circular table sit a Trandoshan male in a combat jumpusit, an ageing, pink-skinned Twi'lek female dressed in relative finery, an attractive brunette human woman who holds a datapad in her hands, and a grey-furred Wookiee male. Sitting opposite are two black-cloaked individuals - One a dark-skinned, heavily built Zabrak, the other a slight woman. Her exact appearance and species are concealed by a large cowl and the long gloves covering her arms.
All of them look up as you enter. Only the Zabrak at the table looks pleased to see you, his mouth twitching into a smile that causes the white tattoos on his dark skin to stretch. His eyes pass over you, locking with Saden's momentarily, then finally coming to rest on Kar.
