# [A Broken Galaxy]Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-06 15:46:47)

A LONG TIME AGO, IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY...
Eriadu, a Republic controlled Outer Rim planet, has become well known for many things, none the least being the widening gap in status of humans and non-humans.  The Republic, with the aid of the Jedi, have made several attempts to curb this startling trend, with mixed success.  But despite all of this, in one city of the planet, Phelar, there is at least one place where any race can remain comfortably.
The bar known as the Sleeping Rancor earns its name from its signature drink, which patrons claim is alcoholic enough to knock out a fully grown rancor.  Whether this is true is yet to be verified, but it has the intended effect on its patrons.
The bar is not a pleasant place.  Members of various species crowd the area, filling the air with a cacophany of noise, and behind the bar a rather gruff looking Ithorian with a permanently swollen eye is serving drinks.  It is a well known haunt for the dregs of society, and is filled with many aromas, not all of them legal.  For these reasons and more, the local authorities tend to avoid this place.
Which makes it ideal for recruiting.
A human woman enters the bar and makes for an unoccupied table.  She is dressed similarly as the rest in the bar, and looks unremarkable, except for an innate cheerfulness she seems to exude, and hair so blond it borders on white.  To most, she would just seem to be a nice young lady who wandered into the wrong bar.  To the few who knew, however, she was much more.

A young man accompanies the woman into the bar.  He is dressed much like she is; remarkably so, in fact.  An elaborate tattoo, almost tribal in appearance, covers much of his face. In this crowd of aliens and scum, though, he fits right in and no one pays it much mind.  At least, that was the idea when he came along in the first place.
He was here simply an observer.  No more, no less.  He was to watch and learn, and not participate unless he had to.  That irks him a bit, and causes a scowl to appear on his face.  Its effect, though, was to make him blend into the crowd even more.
He closely follows the woman, acting almost like a bodyguard, considering the almost non-existent distance between them.  Though, of course, it was probably he who needs more protection than she does.  She was the more experienced of the two.
His name was Zeke Coltrider, and he was a Chatos Paladin.

The woman, Ella, finally finds a table.  She sits and then motions for Zeke to do the same.
"Oh, don't look so depressed," she says with an almost child-like grin on her face, "You might scare people off."

Drex Void is standing at the bar seemingly listening to the locals and getting what information he can from local gossip and stories...then deciding how best he can use that information.
(Gather Information +8).
For those who notice him see he is tall male humanoid with an average muscular build, with short black hair and a soul patch below his bottom lip. He seems to be wearing an all Black attire consisting of a Long Piece Jacket and Pants with some combat boots of sorts. The Green Lenses of his Goggles shine as they wrap around his head below his hairline. His Scar across his right eye is about the only thing that might show he know danger but it might not show enough of how dangerous he might be with his charming smile.

A smile almost crept onto Zeke's face, but he banished it before anyone could notice.
"I am not depressed," he says, as he leans back in his seat and folds his arms across his chest.

Sitting cautiously in a corner in the bar, Haesh watched the woman and her associate enter. He knew the woman fleetingly, and had seen the man at her side a few times before. The were both with the Chatos, just like him. Watching them sit down, he turned his eyes around the other patrons in the bar. From his lonely corner, he had an excellent wiew of the events that passed around him, and in turn, no one would look twice at him. While Yakora in themselves might be a little rare, his clothing gives him away as a poor commoner, dressed in robes. Until someone looked closer that is. Under the cloth of his robes, his hand rests only inches away from the blaster at his side.
He wasnÂ´t aware if the other knew he was there. They could take care of themselves, of that he had no doubt, but when working with openly opposing as powerful factions as the Chatos did, a little extra precaution never hurt.

"You could have fooled me," Ella says with a giggle.  Her gaze wanders over to Haesh long enough to show recognition, but quickly moves elsewhere.  Despite all appearances to the contrary, Ella was no fool; she knew too many off them gathering together could arouse suspicion.
----------
Drex learns from idle chatter that the situation between humans and non-humans is beginning to worsen in Phelar, and several non-human gangs have been more active than usual.
"If you'rnt like them," comments a friendly, and quite obviously intoxicated Rodian, "yorn't even worth more than bantha dung."

Drex grins "Well thanks for the heads up."  and thinks to himself ~Always something new to know and to exploit it to your gain~ the grin get slightly bigger on Drex's face then as it fades he glances over the room to see if the "Recruiter" has arrived yet.
Drex notices the very blond woman and expects that is his "Recruiter" as there doesn't seem to be another blond in his sight. Drex heads over to the table noticing the man with her but pays him no mind as he expects he is her protection.
He grabs a chair and slides into the table next to her. "Well hello beautiful, I suppose you wouldn't mind me sitting with you as I am sure you were looking for me....." Drex leans in a bit and speaks softly "...by the way your bodyguard probably shouldn't sit with you, to me that would draw far too much attention."  Drex sits back a bit and looks at the Man at the table with her "Though I suppose who couldn't resist sitting next to a beautiful women, right friend?"  Drex grins.  (Persuasion Check +3 to improve attitude of "Ella?")

A retort to the man's comment nearly escaped Zeke's lips, but he kept quiet.  *You are not to engage the recruits unless absolutely necessary.  Do I make myself clear?*  Those had been Master Kenobi's words to him just before their departure.  As frustrating as that was, Zeke kept his mouth shut.  He couldn't afford to upset the Paladins.  He needed them.
He closely eyed the black-clad man, searching for any weapons that he knew must be there.

Appart from the vibroblade slung across the man's back, Zeke manages to spot both a hidden vibrodagger and hold out blaster pistol.
"Thank you," Ella says keeping her smile.  However, despite this, a change seems to come over her.  Her smile seems to be less personal and more polite.  It appears that despite how she acts on her time, on the job she is completely professional.

Zeke eyed the man's weapons, but didn't say anything.  Instead, he shifted in his seat a bit, allowing the man to more easily see the blaster carbine slung over his shoulder, almost as if to say, *My guns are bigger, so don't mess with us if you're not serious.*

Drex leans in a bit with a charming grin and speaks in a low voice "Well, I know there are four powers in this universe at the moment fighting for power, unfortunately the Jedi seem to be the Puppet Masters behind this little power struggle and the Republic is their Puppet." He winks at Ella "That's why I am here beautiful, to simply throw my self in with the good guys and make sure they come in on top." 
Drex leans in closer and whispers "I also have reason to believe the "Puppet Masters" are also inciting this planets Non Human Aggression of late, to most likely swoop in and play hero and make out the villain to be the Chatos or even perhaps the Sepratist and no telling what that could due to both party's relationships...and their public image."  (Deception *Information* +13)

Kyle Drayson is enjoying his Corellian ale in a corner table by himself. He is dressed in a cloak that covers the armor and weapons he must be wearing and he seems to be at home in this type of establishment.
He noticed the young lady and her escort who had entered the bar and checked his chrono. "She must be the recruiter", he thought to himself. However, he decided waiting was the best option till he could be completely sure.
When another person (Drex) sits down and begins conversing with the woman, Kyle makes an attempt to overhear the conversation. (Perception +8)

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-17 00:16:35)

Despite all the ambient noise of the bar, Kyle is able to follow the conversation with relative ease.  Though a few words are missing, he at least manages to catch the word "Chatos."
Drex speaks with apparent sincerity, and at least Ella seems convinced.
"Is that so?  Well, it would appear that your going to be helpful from the start."
Her smile once again shifts, becomes friendlier.  Not quiet as friendly as it was with her associate, but it makes the meeting seem slightly less formal, at any rate.  She turns to Zeke and says, "If all our new recruits are like this one, the new location may be even better than the first."

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

Zeke grunted softly in agreement.  So the Jedi were the "Puppet Masters" in the escalating racial tensions?  He'd believe that.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-17 03:45:42)

As it appears that the meeting is going well, Haesh turns his eyes and other senses toeards the rest of the bar. He looked around for anyone looking suspicious, anyone that showed some kind of interest in Ella and her company, or anyone that looked like they might work with the Empire or the Jedi.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-17 17:32:14)

Haesh notices that a human man (Kyle) seems to have taken an interest, but only passively.  On the contrary, he also notices an Arcona and Gammorian eyeing the group as well, whispering quietly to one another.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-21 09:52:59)

As Haesh continues watching, the Gammorian rises from the table, only to be motioned down by the Arcona.  Haesh is close enough to hear the Arcona's words, "Its not worth it."

"Well," Ella says to Drex, "I suppose that's that.  All that's left is to send you to the pick up spot.  Just outside the city, there is an abandoned factory.  Your transport is waiting there."

Zeke barely manages to keep the shock off his face as he looks at Ella.  Though he was supposed to stay silent, he just couldn't hold the question in.  "That's it?  We're gonna let him in, just like that?" he says, though he manages to keep his voice low.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-21 12:03:59)

Noticing how the Arcona and Gammorean seems to have more than a fleeting interest with Ella and her group, Haesh decides to keep an eye on them. Sensing that trouble might also be ahead, he pulls out his blaster under his robe, and switches it to Stun mode.
((How far am I from them?))

((*There at the next table.  Probably should have mentioned that* :P))
Ella's smile fades a little.
"He supports our cause.  I've learned long ago that why doesn't matter.  We're in a war, and sadly we have to take everyone we can get.  It's not-"
But whatever it inn't, you never find out.  At that moment, as if on cue, a fist slammes into the table.  It belonges to a very angry looking Whipid, who growles something in his own language.
"He says your at our table," a Sullustan behind him translates.  A rather gruff looking Quarren who was beside him chuckles.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-21 14:05:32)

Haesh raises an eyebrow when the Whipid slams his fist into their table. They were only three of them, and neither of the people at the table were new to battle, if it had to come to that. He did however become curious as to wether the Whipid and his friends were perhaps only there to instigate a fight, and had other friends waiting just to join in. Casting a glance at the Arcona and Gammorean at the next table, he readied his blaster in case anyone of them tried anything.
In a moment of inspiration, he decided to try and stir things around a bit. He reached out with the Force towards the drink in front of the Gammorean, and with a soft nudge, he sent it flying, straight towards the Whipid.
((Ok, IÂ´m just assuming thereÂ´s a drink there, and that I can send it on its way successfully against the Whipid (Use the Force 19, taking 10). Ready an action to fire a stun bolt at the first of the Arcona and Gammorean if a fight breaks out and they join in against Ella and the others))

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-21 14:28:36)

The Whipid was growling out another sentence when the glass hit him.  He stood there motionless for a moment, as his two companions backed away, terror in their eyes.  The Whipid's face contorted into a savage grin, and everyone gets the distinct impression he is glad to have an excuse to hit someone.
This suspicion is proven true as he sends a punch flying to Ella, which connects and sends her sprawling to the floor.

Drex's eyes seem to glow for a minute as he stood up from the Whipid slamming his fist into the table, how unfortunate for him though he did not have the time to dissuade him from making a mistake but as he punches Ella.
Drex thinks ~Hmm I believe Disemboweling this idiotic creature will end the fight quickly~
Drex unsheathes his Vibroblade and lunges it towards the now exposed side of the Whipid in a form of Strength and lust to see the Aliens Bowels spill upon the floor.

Ged sits quietly at a table in the corner, trying to blend in but quickly realizing he picked the wrong bar. As the Whipid starts to get nasty the man sighs and sets down the lone drink he'd been nursing. Ged doesn't want to draw attention to himself but somehow violence always seems to follow him.

Ged's initiative count: 20
Drex's vibroblade comes mere inches from disembowling the Whipid((12 points of damage)), and seems to be the cue his allies were waiting for.
The Quarren draws a vibrodagger from his side and rushes towards Drex, swinging wildly.  Unsurprisingly, he misses, and is obviously off balance from his rush.  The Sullustan takes a more level headed course of action, namely drawing his blaster pistol, and rushing back to get cover from a table.

Momentarily shocked by the Whiphid's sudden outburst, Zeke remains seated and unmoving for a single, long second.
Then, in a surprising blur, he leaps up and over the table, bringing his Paladin lightsaber up and around.  With a *snap-hiss* the sapphire blue blade comes to life and he swings it around, to point it at the Whiphid's chest.  "That was a very, *very* bad idea."
*1st Move Action: Move around table, if I can, I want to get a flanking bonus with Drex.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-24 00:34:36)

Most of the bar's patrons stop to stare at the weapon produced by Zeke, but the Whipid seems strangely unfazed.  In fact his grin widens, and he growls something else in his native tongue, before snarling, dodging the lightsaber's point, and raking at Zeke with his claws.  His ferocity is unmistakable, and though his attack misses, it proves a point: he is not very easily intimidated.
Meanwhile, the Arcona seems to have been berating the Gamorrean, and now has segued into a rather agressive pep talk, ending by pointing towards the two humans.  The Gamorrean shambles forward reluctantly, armed with a club while the Arcona stays back and draws his blaster pistol((this should activate Haesh's readied action, no?)).
Ella seems to have recovered somewhat from the assault, and crawls towards the nearest table to avoid the rapidly expanding aggression felt in the bar.  After only a moment, the patrons of the bar have transitioned from an awed silence to a rather noisy bar fight.

A drunk and unarmed Rodian advances towards Kyle, making aggressive guestures.  Elsewhere in the bar, a human male seems to be pointing a blaster at Ged, preparing to fire.

Ged's fast action drop the man before he has a chance to strike.  In addition, the crowd is so chaotic that no one seems to be able to pinpoint where the shot came from.
The Quarren is apparently shocked by the death of his boss, but continues to attack, if a bit more cautiously.  He slashes at Drex with his Vibrodagger while his Sullustan ally carefully lines up a shot on Zeke.

Zeke is barely able to parry the blaster shot with his saber, deflecting it harmlessly into the ceiling.  *That was too close,* he thinks, as a rain on dust falls on him.
He dashes toward the Sullustan while brining his lightsaber around.  Guided by the Force, he aims to take the Sullustan down before he could really hurt someone.

Turning to face the Gammorean, Haesh stared the pig down at point blank range, brought his pistol up square in his face and pulled the trigger. Then he backed away from the couple, and his free hand slid inside his robes to produce his lightsaber. With a swift motion he grips the handle in a reversed stance and lets the blue blade flare into life.

The Gammorean rushes at Haesh, throwing off his shot.  He swings his club with anger in his eyes, but misses Haesh's head by a good distance, probably from surprise of the weapon he drew.
The Arcona, while disoriented from the stun shot, has enough presence of mind to tip over a table by him.  He crouches behind and fires a shot of his own at Haesh, missing his target but hitting an unknown patron in the mob.(Insert the Wilhelm Scream)
The Rodian confronting Kyle either doesn't understand or is too drunk to care.  Either way, he moves forward clumsily, drawing his fist back to punch.

Drex speaks quite loud to the Quarren and the Sullastan and anyone else that can understand him
"I've already killed one of you and he was one of the strongest and most dangerous, I gain nothing from your deaths but the Jedi who are playing all of us against each other are and they will be coming here soon.....so ask yourselves do you really want to be here  when they arrive?"

The chaos in the bar seems to die down at Drex's words.  All the scum of the bar seem to focus in on the lone human standing with a vibrosword in hand and a dead body at his feet.  One didn't argue with someone like that.
Or at least, the regular patrons of the bar didn't.  While they seemed to be calming down, a voice rose up from the entrance.
"FREEZE!"
A man, obviously from the local law enforcement, was standing at the entrance with a blaster drawn.  His eyes focused on Drex first, but quickly darted to the two ignited lightsabers in the room.
"Confirmed Chatos involvement," he spoke into a comlink.  Then, to the entirety of the bar, he shouted, "Nobody move!  We have the place surrounded!"

Zeke spots Ella hiding behind a table, somehow managing to stay out of the other man's line of sight.  She makes a motion to Zeke to remain where he is.
"Alright," the officer says, his eyes darting between the two Chatos Paladins, "You are going to come with me for questioning.  The rest of you will be confined to this premise until further notice."
Several of the aliens in the bar seem quite displeased with this statement, but remain where they are, waiting for something to happen.

Haesh looks around for a few moments, and with a quick motion he deactivates his lightsaber, and the hilt vanishes into his robes. Shining a smile towards the officer, he holds his hands out as a sign of nonhostility and moves towards the man.
"Well done officer. You are to be commended for your efforts here today. If you donÂ´t mind, I will be taking this...scum...with me back to the temple now. The Council has asked me to bring them to justice"

There was a general grumble of agreement in the crowd to Drex's comment. Before anything can be done about it, however, Haesh comes forward, apparently claiming to be a Jedi.
"Sir," the officer said, stuttering slightly, "I-I was not aware there were any other Knights in the area. I shall send word to Vergon. Please, allow us to escort you to a transport."

"I don't think that will be necissary, sir," a Bothan woman says, entering the bar. She is young and seems to be studying the people in front of her.
"I will inform Master Vergon myself."
She walks foward and brings Haesh close in what appears to be a sign of friendship.

Actually quite relived that someone had come along to save his partially desperate lie, Haesh offers a small nod to the Bothan woman. He is not about to give his lightsaber up however, and he cannot for his life understand how it would further the disguise of him being a Jedi. He waves is hand towards the others.

Ged is more than a little confused by what's going on right now. However if they really do have the place surrounded it seems following the yarkora might be the best way to get out of this. Lowering his rifle the clone gets ready to leave.

Kyle has no clue as to what just happened, but he feels that leaving with the yarkora is probably his best chance out getting out of the cantina especially if it is surrounded. Kyles holsters his blaster and stands up in preparation to leave.

The Bothan woman leads Haesh and any who would follow him out of the bar. Outside, they learn that the officer was not bluffing; several well armed humans in uniform stand ready to move if things go badly. They give odd glances to the aliens passing by them, but do not act.
The Bothan takes Haesh to an armored vehicle. Stopping just outside the door, she motions for him to get in. She also says, "I'm only going to ask you one more time. Please surrender your weapons."
Haesh and those who followed her can see her draw a lightsaber of her own rather subtly. This time the message was clear: do as I say or you might get hurt.
Within the bar, Zeke ponders for a moment on the woman, before it hit him: a Bothan woman had been mentioned in his briefing as the padawan of the area's resident Jedi Sentinel, Master Vergon!

When the realization of the Bothan's identity hit him, Zeke reached out with the Force to contact Haesh and warn him. This was a dangerous game they were playing.
He then glanced around, looking for a back way out, or any way that he wouldn't have to fight.

Haesh isnÂ´t really comfortable with the Bothan asking him to give up his weapon yet again. The others he could understand, it wouldnÂ´t make a very convincing "arrest" if they didnÂ´t disarm their prisoners. He discreetly unclipped his lightsaber from his belt inside his robes, trying to keep it hidden from her sight.
Suddenly he could feel someone touching his mind, sending an impression that she wasnÂ´t an ally, that she was in fact a true Jedi. He cast a quick glance around, trying to count the soldiers surrounding them. If it was to come down to a fight, he wanted to keep the upper edge.

Zeke's eyes wander to a slightly ajar door behind the bar. The Ithorian who had been the barkeep had probably left through there. He also noticed Ella seemed to be motioning to that door.
Haesh finds that there are about twelve officers armed with blaster rifles, as well as a police vehicle not far away. They were facing the bar and away from the vehicle he was being hearded into, which was across the street, but they were close enough to respond to a disturbance.
The Bothan watched Haesh, and sighed.
"Please don't make this any more difficult than it has to be," she whispered, gripping her own lightsaber more tightly.

It appears to Ged as though things aren't going so well. While he's not sure he'll get another chance to meet with Chatos agents he certainly has no intention of being captured by Jedi. Hoping the bothan's attention is focused on Haesh, Ged tries to slip away.

Drex takes advantage of the attention being diverted from him as others left he stayed in the bar, he decides to try and slip away but knowing it may be fool hardy if he doesn't create a "little" noise before he runs out the back may get him shot.
Drex points into the middle of some of the aliens walking out/standing closet to the front door and yells out
"LOOK OUT, A THERMAL DETONATOR!!!"
Then Drex tries to slip out the back of the Cantina, hopefully not being noticed

Drex's deception seems to have the desired effect. The bar quickly becomes engulfed in chaos once more, and Drex, Zeke, and Ella have no problem sneaking out while terrified bar patrons rush in all directions to escape.
Out side the bar, the officers immediately react. Six of them attempt to contain the crowd that was rushing out of the bar, with little success. The retreat six towards the armored vehicle to protect the Jedi. In the chaos no one seems to notice Ged and Kyle slip away.
The Bothan moves forward to accept the lightaber, but still watches Haesh warily.

Haesh realizes that the Bothan is sharper than he had hoped, and that he probably needs to take some drastic measure to divert her attention. Taking a deep breath, he springs into action. Snapping his lightsaber into life, he shoves his other hand forward, releasing a wave of compressed air against the lightsaber held by the bothan. Continuing his movement, he swings his blade up towards her throat, not to kill, but simply to keep her in check.
"DonÂ´t move"
He hisses between his teeth.

Zeke takes a calming breath as he steps out the back door. "That was a nice distraction. I'm just glad it didn't backfire on us." he said quietly to Drex. Speaking louder wasn't an option right now. Someone could hear them.
Without another word, Zeke moves to the wall and quietly follows it around to the front of the building, keeping his back to it at all times. When he gets to the front, he peers around to the commotion now taking place out there.

((*Its after noon, still daylight but for a few hours*))
Zeke moves to the front of the building with little difficulty. The clamor in front of the building is diverting most of the attention of the authorities. Through the seething masses he manages to see the scene unfolding on the other side of the road.
Haesh's attack against the Bothan is less successful than he anticipated. The force attack causes her to spin, but she retains her grip on the lightsaber. Using the motion, she ignites her silver blade and brings it forward, in an almost mirror of Haesh's own position.
The three nearby officers notice the standoff, and bring their rifles to the ready.
"Stand down," she orders, then looks back to Haesh.
"It would appear we are in what a holo-chess player would call stalemate."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-13 06:19:39)

Regaining his stance after the failed assault, Haesh curses himself for not taking the lethal strike when he had the chance. He realized that it was very possible the time had come where he would cross blades with a Jedi. He cautiously watched the silver blade hanging in the air in front of him.
"It would appear so"
With a swift movement of his blade, he pats the Bothan weapon aside enough to avoid taking a swipe as he takes a quick step back. Bringing his swordarm back, he reverses his grip on the lightsaber into the backhanded stance he prefers, holding his other hand out towards her.
"The question is, how good a player are you?"

The Bothan stands her ground, apparently concentrating on something. Then, without warning, Haesh feels his lightsaber fly from his hand, and land in the outstretched hand of the Bothan. She turns it off and resumes a battle ready position.

"That's the point. I don't want to fight you. The only reason we're fighting is because you've been taken in by Obi-Wan's lies. But I sense Light in you, so why should we fight when we can talk?"

The distinctive *snap-hiss* of a lightsaber can still stop Ged in his tracks. While it appears he could escape unnoticed the sounds of the confrontation between the yarkora and the bothan cause him to turn back around. From this distance things appear to have gone poorly for the yarkora, causing Ged to hesitate. "Ah fierfek, I can't just leave," he mutters. Drawing a bead on the bothan Ged is about to fire when she suddenly extinguishes her lightsaber. Finger on the trigger, he decides to wait and see what's going on.

Ged remains unseen as he hides behind a nearby sign. Zeke, however, is less fortunate. After bumbing into dozens of people in the crowd, he finally comes face to face with one of the police.
"Chatos!" the human shouts as he fires his blaster, drawing the attention of the three officers near Haesh. One remains with the Jedi, while the other two advance on Zeke and each fire a shot from their rifles.

"Yeah, they seem to have a real issue with opening fire on people"

Ella looks out at the crowd and sighs.
"I hate to agree with you," she says to Drex, "but we need to get out of here. But if you think we're just going to leave our friend over there, think again. Its not like we have people flocking to our cause; we need every person we can get."
She hastily brings out a datapad and inputs something into it. She then puts it into the hands of Drex.

Deciding that perhaps the easiest way to get out of this situation was simply to follow suite, Haesh raised his hands to show that he will comply.

He turns around to see the standoff between the 2 force users. "I really shouldn't get involved" Kyles says to himself. However, upon hearing "Chatos!" and several stun bolts being fired, Kyle realizes that leaving doesn't get him any closer to what he desires and makes his way toward the outer edge of the crowd, his hand ready to draw his blaster if a there was to be a major confrontation with the police.

Heash wasnÂ´t worried for his own sake, but he was getting a bad feeling about what had become of the Jedi Order, and whatever guilt he had felt for leaving them was eased at once. He would always pull through, either by wits or blade, but it would be harder to patch up the Order.

As they left to wherever they were going, he spoke to Ella. "As for a new identity . . . I was a bounty hunter once. Before all this. I wasn't that well known, but I *was* known. After I lost my last partner . . . " he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence. "I could use a new one. No one knows I'm a Paladin, not yet, so we can use that as cover. How's that sound?"
He throws a thumb over his shoulder at Kyle. "And if he needs one, well, this duo can become a trio."

"Alright everybody follow me," Elle says as she leads them down the alley.

Haesh tries to catch the Bothans eyes.
"Are you sure? If you tried to listen to what we say, to talk to us, I am sure we could work our differences out without the need for battle"
Scratching the fur by his nose, he continues.
"I hate the thought of taking arms against the Jedi, and hope I see as little of that as possible. However, I will not back down, because I know what happens if we donÂ´t resist is worse. CanÂ´t you see it, the Jedi Order has lost its focus, its place and power as observers and guardians. The Jedi survived for thousands of years without getting overly involved in politics, why change that now?"
He tries to keep his eyes fixed in hers.
"What makes you so certain that even the greatest of masters are incorruptable? When did the words of the Jedi become set as a universal truth so great that all others must be eradicated in favor of it? IsnÂ´t it possible that even the greatest intentions can breed disaster?"

"We're here," Elle tells Zeke as they reach what appears to be a run down warehouse. The streets surrounding it seem to be deserted save for a few pieces of trash floating in the wind. Elle quietly goes to one door and opens it, motioning for her allies to enter quickly.
-----
"And yet," Jastra countered, "If all we stayed were observers, nothing would have been done. Had the Jedi done nothing, then Palpatine... Sidious... would have had a complete takeover. The Republic needs us to guide it."
Then with a smile on her face, Jastra says, "This is wonderful. We're actually talking, trying to reconcile. I think there might be hope for our sides yet."

"Of course there is. And with the more people who realizes it, we can keep the fighting to a minimum"
Haesh offered a smile in return. At least she didnÂ´t seem as bad as he had worried.
"Sidious had to be stopped, no doubt of that. But why did the Jedi remain in power? The new chancellor is more than capable of being head of state alone, and the Jedi did fine as advisors and guides before, without getting tangled up in the politics"

Zeke follows close behind Elle as they enter the warehouse, looking around cautiously as he crossed the threshold. He trusted Elle but it was in his nature to be cautious. Who knew what waited for them within the dark confines of the warehouse that even Ella did not know about?

Zeke looks around to see the warehouse is largely deserted. One corner, however, has several crates piled in various arrangements. Elle walks forward and announces with pride, "Welcome to Chateau Elle. Or Chateau... whoever I am now."

"If the government is guided by the Force, wouldn't peace soon follow? I mean, under different circumstances we'd be within site of a galactic utopia. We'd-"

Zeke looks around. "So . . . what is this place? Just your base of operations? Who else knows about it?" His head was filled with questions about the place, mostly about its security.
He waited for Elle to answer as he wandered over to the crates, examining them closely. Just because Elle thought it was safe didn't mean it had stayed that way. There was no reason to be an idiot about it.

Laughing at the driverÂ´s comment, Haesh replied.
"Terribly sorry, I tend to talk quite a lot. Perhaps you should just put me off at the next landing pad"
Turning back to the Bothan, he continued.
"Really? Tell me something, if SidiousÂ´s plan had succeeded, do you think the Galaxy would have been a good place? Because he was guided by the Force as well. It takes more than the Force to be a good leader. During the war, our troopers followed their Jedi commanders, not because they knew they were guided by the Force, but because they inspired loyalty, stood at the front with them, and could lead them to victory. They didnÂ´t care if I sat down every morning to meditate, but they did care that my lightsaber created an eye in the storm of blaster bolts for the medic to dart in and save three of our men in"

((Whoops, forgot about Zeke and the gang))
Zeke finds little which could be considered dangerous, unless one considers rumaging through crates of clothing dangerous. What Zeke does notice is that there is a lot of clothing, of many different styles. Dresses, suits, casual clothing, and even a few uniforms could seen in one open crate.
Elle goes to another crate, rummages around for a bit, and finally pulls out what appear to be military rations.
"Want some?"

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-02 23:49:00)

Zeke grabbed the rations from her hand. It had been a long time since he'd eaten--it almost felt like months. He eagerly chowed down on the rations, pushing past their almost unpalatable nature. It was food, at least.
"Sobe," he says around a mouthful, "Dees cotumes mut elp diguizing yerelf. Oo do oo wanna be naw?"

"Different how?"
As the driver - seemingly annoyed - urged them to get out of the vehicle, Haesh got to his feet and prepared to do so.
"I am sure you will have time to think about what IÂ´ve said. If you want to talk more, please, come and visit me"
Before stepping out of the vehicle, he turned around and held out his hand towards her.
"Oh, and could I *please* have my lightsaber back now? I promise not to activate it, but it is a symbol of what I am, and keeping it against my will really donÂ´t show a lot of respect in the Jedi ranks"

As the fight breaks up Ged shoulders his rifle and disappears into the crowd. Spotting those that had been identified as Chatos he does his best to follow them without being noticed. When the trio stops at a warehouse Ged waits for them to get inside before approaching. Ged frowns thinking, 'Barging right in like a *di'kut* might get somebody killed'. He shrugs and does the only thing he can think of, knock on the door.

"I'll leave it with the warden," Jastra says with a smile, "and I'll see if I can talk him into letting you have it back. Please, be patient until then and follow these men."
She gestures towards the two armed humans standing just outside the speeder. She waves goodbye as she turns to leave. You finally have a chance to see where you are. It appears you have been taken within the walls of a prison complex, though not within the prison itself.
One of the humans grunts, "You heard the Jedi. Now don't give us any trouble."
-------
"Well..." Elle begins, but is cut off by a knocking at the entrance of the warehouse. Her head turns quickly to the door. She motions for her companions to be silent, and grabs a dirty and torn cloak from a nearby crate. She puts it on and then closes her eyes.
What happens next is unusual, even for Chatos operatives. As she stands there, Elle's hair begins to shorten. It becomes darker, then grey. Her skin seems to wrinkle. Within moments, a bedraggled old man stands where Elle once did.
The man goes to the door, opening it only slightly to hide the blaster he had drawn, and says, "Hello?"

---

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Valheru** (2009-06-03 13:30:31)

Ged is somewhat surprised, having expected one of the three he saw earlier to answer the door. He thinks he's doing a pretty good job keeping the astonishment from showing, but sometimes he forgets there's no helmet over his face anymore.
"Uh...hello. I, um, saw some people come in here that I'd like to speak to."

---

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-03 13:40:06)

Haesh sighs. The Jedi really had become quite rigid and unflexible.
"Fine. I guess IÂ´ll just wait here then"
Watching her leave, he takes a look around. Was this really what the Order had become? As one of the humans grunts, quite uncalled for, Haesh looks at the man.
"No, of course not. IÂ´m just sitting here waiting nicely for someone to come and "reeducate" me, as she so nicely put it. What possible reason could I have not to cooperate?"

Zeke quickly swallows his food before he answers. It, at least, gives him a chance to overcome his surprise. "I, uh, no. No, I've never seen her do that before." Then the realization dawns on him. Elle was a shapeshifter. That would have been nice to know earlier.

The elderly man studies Ged for a moment, and suddenly a slightly disturbing smile spreads across his face.
"I recognise that face now..." he mutters, as he opens the door wider and puts away his blaster.
"Come in, come in. There's no need to worry, friends. If this is who I think he is... well, he won't be an enemy."

"Good," the man says, "Follow us."
One man moves towards the prison building while another remains behind Haesh indicating he should move.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Valheru** (2009-06-05 01:37:32)

The phrase 'I recognize that face' puts on Ged on edge. He doesn't remember seeing the old man at the bar so that can only mean one thing in his mind. Apparently he isn't doing enough to disguise his appearance, but then Ged thought the intervening years had made it less necessary. Still he has nothing left to lose at this point. Entering the room cautiously, a trained eye will notice his hand never strays far from his blaster, Ged is somewhat reassured to see two of the people he followed here.
Meeting the Force-user's gaze Ged replies evenly, "Just a man who opposes the Jedi Order and its sense of...justice," the word sounding like a curse off his lips. Equally blunt Ged continues, "The officer in the bar called you Chatos. If that's true I'd like to join you."

---

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-05 18:14:02)

"Join us?" Zeke was skeptical. "We don't just pick up people we find off the street like the Jedi."
He grabbed the man's arm and pulled him in, closing the door tightly behind him. There was no reason just to stand in the doorway and talk. Someone less than favorable to the Chatos might see them. "Why do you want to join us?"

---

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Mandalore89** (2009-06-06 23:31:03)

Kyle looked at Zeke. "Actually the reason I seeked you out after what happened at the cantina was because I wish to join Chatos as well, and I'm sure that you wouldn't turn down an extra blaster or two."

---

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Valheru** (2009-06-07 03:00:52)

Gedin nods at the Corellian before turning back to the Chatos agent.
"Right, besides I thought I made that clear. The Jedi are corrupt. They can't be allowed to continue twisting the Republic to their will," he declares with palpable conviction.
â€œNow, do you want help stopping them or not?â€

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-07 07:07:45)

"Gee, seems you wouldnÂ´t find sarcasm if it came up and bit you..."
Deciding to see what would happen, Haesh simply followed the guards. Not for any particular reason though, he thought it was funny to see them stumble time and again, almost as if theyÂ´d struck their feet on some invisible object.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

"The more the merrier!" the old man cries out, smiling a toothless grin.
He sits down on a crate nearby, motioning for everyone to do the same, and then says, "Now, where was I?"
-------
"Smartass," one of the men mutteres under his breath as they lead Haesh towards the prison. While walking the hallways and stumbling, they cast suspicious glares at Haesh, but say nothing. They finally arrive at a cell which appears just like every one they have past. The lead guard opens the door, then turns to Haesh.
"Get in."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-07 18:27:41)

Haesh looks into the cell.
"Wow, it looks better than I expected. Do you have any idea how long I am to remain here?"
He went into the cell and settled down into a meditative position. Before closing his eyes, he cast a final glance at the guards.
"Maybe you should ask someone in charge about that, because I wonÂ´t hang around forever you know"

Shoenab had been sitting in this cell for longer than he cared to remember.
*I guess that that's what you get when you turn on your master in the Jedi Temple.*
He sighed to himself as he continued his meditations.
Finally, he felt something. Heard it too. Turning his head, he heard the sounds of someone coming down the hall. Combining that with the vision the Force had given him of someone new being thrown in a cell, Shoenab knew he had a neighbor.
After waiting for the guards to leave, the young blind Jedi stood and walked to the wall, on the other side of which was the new prisoner.
"Hey! New guy! My name's Shoenab. Who are you?"

He couldn't believe Elle's attitude toward the newcomers. She--or he--was just going to let them in just like that. He'd worked for months to join them. A frown creasing his face, he joined Elle over on the crates.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Valheru** (2009-06-08 18:39:51)

Ged does his best to suppress a smirk now that the old man has apparently silenced his antagonist. He takes a seat on a nearby crate and awaits with interest to see how things unfold.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-08 20:48:55)

The man sit for a moment, thinking. Then he seems to find his train of thought.
"Thats right, Elle was talkin' about the rescue, right? Old Yorn in't one to plan. Let's find someone else, shall we?"
The man, apparently Old Yorn, hobbles over to another set of crates stacked on top of one another. He vanishes behind them for a moment, and then a younger man, with shoulder length black hair and a cocky grin walks back.
"So, lets get the planning underway, alright? I've been here long enough to know that their probably taking Haesh to a prison not far from the city. Now, this prison isn't exactly the best in the galaxy, if you get my drift, but they'd still notice a bunch of strangers trying to march a prisoner out of the front gate, even if they were in uniform.
Now, being that its a rather low end place, there are a couple of things they have to do without. The one that we're most interested in is this: they have no contained method of dealing with trash. No compactor. No incinerator. Instead, every couple of days a local service sends a hover to pick up the garbage."
The man smiles a sly grin, waiting for his companions to put the pieces together.
------
Haesh finds that the cell is, despite being surprisingly spacious, unremarkable. Two bunks jut out from the wall, and the bottom one contains a large bundle of rags that smells of alcohol and... well, the Force only knows what else. The bundle rythmically moves up and down, indicating that something, hopefully another prisoner, is sleeping there.
From the wall to the right of the cell door, Haesh hears the voice of Shoenab.

### **Valheru** (2009-06-09 01:48:27)

Gedin can't even try to hide the shock on his face this time. However realization slowly dawns on him, this must be one of those shapeshifters his brothers had talked about. He'd always assumed those stories were, at least slightly, exaggerated but apparently not! Ged is about to ask a question when the man, or whatever it is, jumps straight into planning a mission. Immediately interested, Ged shuts up and listens.
When it becomes apparent the shapeshifter is waiting for comments Gedin speaks up. "Well it should be easy enough to impersonate the disposal crew. How do we get word to Haesh about the plan though, and can he get into the garbage bin safely and undetected?"

---

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-09 17:47:06)

Zeke nodded. "We use the Force. We should be able to get a simple message that way. If he knows we're coming, he should be able to find a way down a chute in time. When do we go in?"

---

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-09 17:57:34)

"Not so simple, I'm afraid," the man responds, then continues, "Problem one: the chutes for disposal are located a fair way away from most of the cells, and I doubt they gave Haesh the grand tour as they came in. Problem two: the disposal team that comes to the prison usually consists of two people, and thats how many the hover seats, anyway. So answer one: a few of us pose as the disposal team while the others sneak around the prison and search for Haesh's cell. Find him, get him out, and get back to the truck. Answer two: two of us can impersonate disposal workers, hiding in plain site, while the other two have to take a less... conventional hiding space, I'm afraid."

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-09 18:01:50)

As he sat down to meditate, trying to shut out the rest of the world, including whatever he was sharing a cell with, Haesh was disturbed by a voice. After a few moments, he realized the voice was coming through the cell wall, and most likely from the next cell. He moved over to the wall.
"My nameÂ´s Haesh. What are you here for?"

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Valheru** (2009-06-09 19:27:18)

'The Force, that's their answer for everything,' Ged thinks but, perhaps wisely, refrains from mentioning. Dismissing such thoughts he turns his focus back on the matter at hand.
"Well with your...unique talents you could walk right in the front door, couldn't you? I think the rest of us will find it more difficult, but if you can get me past the gate I should be able to stay out of sight. By the way are you positive these garbage chutes are big enough to get through? I'd hate for us to sneak inside only to get our *shebse* stuck on the way out."

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-10 12:44:19)

Shoenab sighed to himself for a second before responding. "I had a *disagreement* with my ... um, let's say my former employers. They felt one way about an idea, I felt another. The disagreement was decided with a fight which I lost. Thus my exile to this lovely side of the galaxy."
The sarcasm was not lost on anyone hearing that last part.

"There is the difficulty of an identity check," the man says. "They're going to notice if a man comes in to work twice in the same day. We don't want to give away that Chatos has a shapeshifter on the planet, anyway."
"So here's my idea: we hijack the trash hauler on its way to the prison. Two of us impersonate the disposal crew, while the other two have to pleasure of hiding in the... refuse. When we get there, the "disposal crew" distracts any guards present while the other two sneak out to find Haesh. If need be we can fake mechanical problems with the hover to buy time. They get him out of his cell with as little noise as possible, get him back to the trash hauler, and we drive out of their with no one the wiser."
"So... who wants to be buried in trash?"

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Valheru** (2009-06-11 02:41:32)

Ged nods at the shapeshifter's explanation. He's no expert on shapeshifter infiltration tactics so he'll take her word for it.
After the plan has been laid out Gedin sighs, "I'll do it. I've never had a problem getting down and dirty for a mission. Besides, I'm no good at distracting people unless it involves shooting them."

As the mission planning breaks up Ged grabs a pack of rations and looks for a place to crash. He's not picky and seems, if not comfortable, at least satisfied with a duracrete floor when necessary.

Zeke takes a spot on the crates, where he can watch the door and settles down. He keeps an eye on the others, even Elle now that she wasn't everything she appeared to be. Ged settles down onto the floor, so Zeke turns to the others to watch their final preparations for the day. Trust didn't come easy to him and he wasn't quite ready to exhaust his short supply on these people. Not yet, anyway.

Ged pops open the ration pack and starts munching away. In between mouthfuls he reassures the changeling, "Oh don't worry, I can take care of myself."
He takes the Clawdite's apparent split personality disorder in stride thinking, 'As long as it doesn't interfere with the mission. Hell if I had the ability to shapeshift I might go a bit *din'la* myself. '
After finishing the ration pack Ged settles down for the night. He quickly falls asleep with his rifle clutched to his chest, almost like a child with a stuffed animal.

Zeke shakes his head, trying to understand that Elle was really a Clawdite named Carn. He could deal with that, but he was surprised he hadn't sensed it before. After they had all finished their meal, he gestured toward Ged.
"We should all be like him. We're going to need our sleep for tomorrow."
As he said this, though, he settled near the door for the first watch. No one was going to catch him by surprise if he had anything to say about it. There were four of them there, so they could each take a two hour shift and still be well rested for the next day. He would feel safer keeping watch for all eight hours, but then who would drive the speeder tomorrow?

"Hey! You still there? You fall asleep?"

Shoenab chuckled to himself for a moment.
"Company would be nice. It gets kind of lonely in here sometimes. Most times, actually. And don't worry about time for meditation, you'll have plenty of time for that. I imagine that we'll be here for quite some time.
"However, if you really want to get back to your meditations, I understand and will leave you in peace."
Shoenab turned and sat down on his bunk, thinking about how long it had been since someone else had been around him to talk to.

"Meditatin'?" Comes a voice from the bundle of rags in Haesh's cell. The speaker shifts his position so that his face can be seen. He is an aged man with a long, off white beard. His eyes appear to be trying to focus on Haesh, and having great difficulty doing so.
"Whad'ya meditin' for? Y'some kinda Jed?"
"Heh. A Jedi in jail. That's funny..."

Hearing the old man's taunts did nothing to calm Shoenab's mood. However, there was a way he could think of. Sitting down himself, he reached out through the Force towards the meditating person in the other cell.

"Keeping watch, are you?" Pol says as he resumes the form of the human male Carn.
"Good idea. Try not to stay up all night, though."
With that, Carn finds a set of crates to lie on and swiftly falls asleep. During the first hour's watch, nothing interesting occurs. The only thing of note during the second hour was that Carn begins to snore.

After the tedious bar brawl and the fool hardy Chatos Jedi trying to save one another, Drex had to slip away in the panicked crowds so he wouldn't have to slaughter anymore useless tools.
Drex had the time to leave his contacts news on his where about and information on what had "really" happened at the Cantina.
Drex having completed all of that brought up the map on the Datapad that Ella had given him and carefully made his way to the warehouse, backtracking himself two times as he was taking note of all possible routes to this "Warehouse".
As he approaches the Warehouse doors he calls out to see if anyone is home with a smile.
"I don't suppose anyone here knows where I could find some new friends of mine or for that matter anyone who knows where they might be?"

Ged's eyes snap open at the sound of someone shouting outside. He's always been a light sleeper and of course he was taught to never fully relax, even during sleep, in an unsecured environment.
Getting up with his blaster held at the ready he quietly makes his way towards thee door. Ged looks at the Force-user to see if the man recognizes the voice and waits for him to make the first move.

Zeke's ears were keenly tuned to the outside, having nothing else to do within the night's shadows. When Drex's voice reached his ears, he was immediately on his feet. He recognized the voice from the cantina earlier and wondered how the man had managed to follow them all the way here.
He pushed open the door slightly and held his carbine at the ready, as Ged joined him at the door. He nodded at his new ally, letting him take the lead for now.

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **Valheru** (2009-06-28 20:35:50)

Ged returns the nod, reassured to see the man has a carbine at the ready instead of that *shabla* glowstick. He takes a deep breath and, with a speed that indicates this is a familiar maneuver for him, pushes the door open with his body using it to cover his back while sweeping the area. Seeing only one man, and recognizing him at that, Ged relaxes ever so slightly, though he's still pointing a rifle at the visitor. He mentally sighs, 'Great, the *uramyc* one. This should be fun.'
Aloud, but not very, he hissed, "Why don't you yell a little louder? I don't think they heard you on Coruscant!". Ged steps aside letting the man get a look inside at Zeke, just in case he doesn't recognize the clone.
"Now get inside if you're going to."
Ged stands ready to close the door once they're all inside.

Drex steps inside and watches the door close.
As Drex steps further in he takes a look around the Warehouse. "Well I could be louder but then again as I recall I don't seem to attract as much trouble as the rest of you...."
Drex turns back to face the two men. "..but let's try to get along for the time being, now to the matters at hand, Ella gave me the map to this place and I managed to slip away from the authorities so what is our status here?"

With a loud snort, Carn awakens and promptly falls off of the crates he'd been using as a bed.
"Huh, wha?" He mutters as he gets up. His eyes drift to Drex, and he says, "Oh. Its just you."
He then climbs back up on the crates and says, "Wake me up if something important happens."

Upon seeing that Carn knows the stranger, Kyle grins from ear to ear and says with enthusiasm, "Glad to see we've got another for the recovery tomorrow."
He sizes up the newcomer with a look and says "So long as you can use one of these," and taps his blaster.
He then pats Zeke on the back. "I'll take next watch, there's no need for us to for die on the way there just because our driver is too tired," he says with a lopsided grin.

As the night passes, nothing more exciting than Drex's reappearance occurs. Carn takes the last watch, so that when you all awaken, he is already in a grubby outfit which could pass for a garbage worker's uniform.
"Rise and shine, everyone," he says with a cheerful smile.

Carn throws another outfit, similar to one he's wearing, towards Zeke.
"Wear this," he says, "You want to look the part, right?"
For the others, he gestures to a crate beside him.
"You're costumes are in here. You should try and not be seen in the first place, but if you are found, you might be able to bluff your way through by wearing a uniform."

Now that his hunger is temporarily satiated Ged walks over to the crate and pulls out a costume. He inspects it then puts it on quickly.
((Are they more garbage worker uniforms?))

Zeke quickly pulls on the uniform without a word, and carefully tucks his lightsaber away inside. His carbine certainly wouldn't fit and he wasn't about to go in completely unarmed. Well, he had the Force, but he trusted his lightsaber more.
He grabbed a few more of the ration packs and devoured them for a quick breakfast. "So, when do we get this party started?"

"I'll wait out here, don't be too long."

As the rays of light from the rising sun beam into the cells, Haesh's cellmate awakens with a groan.
"Mornin' fellas," he grumbles, although in a slightly more pleasant tone than before.

Ged checks his gear to make sure everything's in working order. He looks at the others, "Well no sense in waiting, let's go."

"Let's hit the road, folks," Carn says as he leads the way.
Following him, you find yourselves lead out of the city and into the Eriadu wilderness. After about a half hour's walk, you find a large stone beside the road, and can see what appears to be the prison in the distance.
Carn checks the time and says, "We've got about half an hour til the garbage hauler arrives. Guess we'd better set up an ambush, huh?"
-------
"Better than I have in a long time," the man replies to Shoenab.
He crawls out of his bed and slowly makes his way to one of the two bowls that were brought to the cell in the early morning. He looks at one, grimaces, and then looks to Haesh.
"Hungry?" he asks, offering the bowl to him.

Drex sits in a concealed spot simply relaxing before the ambush comes.

Drex awaits the answer though he can guess that either way it was going to be tedious but it needed to be done.

Zeke looks around. "Well, this looks like a good a place as any for an ambush."
He steps behind the large stone and settles to the ground to wait. There wasn't much to an ambush other than hiding and waiting. He'd done the first, all he now had left was the second. And so he settled in to wait, keeping his eyes on the road in the direction the truck would be coming.

Several minutes pass, with Carn periodically checking the time.

Drex's response doesn't exactly comfort Ged but he lets it go at that.
Settling into his hiding space Ged seems comfortable with the wait. He lets his mind drift slightly without losing focus on the here and now, wondering if working with the Chatos will always be this...relaxed.
He can't help but chuckle at his comrade's disquiet but then again they don't have his training.

Several more minutes pass for the ambush group, and eventually the sound of a distant, but approaching hover vehicle can be heard.

Zeke stays quiet through Carn's groaning, preferring to keep watch in case the vehicle came early. It didn't, according to his chrono, when the sound of the approaching hover truck reached his ears. His back straightened, and he pulled his carbine closer to his chest. "Looks like the party's about to start." He stays hidden behind the stone, relying on his hearing to tell him when the truck is near.

"I know what you mean," Carn replies to Kyle, "But I hope you don't feel so bad that you won't give 'em a few stun bolts."
For those watching, the hover comes swiftly into view. It is a beat up old thing that looks barely distinguishable from the trash it is carrying.
"You guys better get ready. We're probably only getting one shot at this."

"Thank you very much," Carn says, coming out from hiding.
"I'm sorry, but we have to commandeer your vehicle. Don't worry, we won't hurt you."

Ged shoulders his rifle and picks the passenger up, there's no sense in leaving drag marks. He places the unconcious man behind some foliage both for the shade and to hide him from view. Ged then starts rifling through the man's pockets, checking for ID or anything else useful.
"What if they're not out long enough for us to get the job done? The last thing we need is these guys reporting a stolen garbage truck while we're inside the prison," he says grimly. He doesn't like what he's implying but wants to know if Carn has thought this through.

Drex watches as the others quickly and efficently take out the drivers, though killing them would probably be better in the long run.
In response to Ged's comment of what to do he chimes in before he makes his way into the back of the Truck.
"I could always cut their Achilles tendons, then they would only be able to crawl to get help but since we aren't being you normal criminals I would suggest stripping them of their clothes thus buying us time."

With a shake of his head Ged shrugs and leaves the unconscious man as he is. He doesn't see the point in stripping the garbage worker and doesn't want to kill him either. Hopefully everything will work out.
He hands the stolen ID to Zeke, "I doubt you'll need it but I figured it couldn't hurt." The clone then walks to the back of the truck and mentally prepares himself for the stench before hopping in. Ged moves the garbage around to conceal himself from any prying eyes before calling out to let Zeke know they're ready. "Alright, let's do this thing."

"IÂ´m hoping it doesnÂ´t. At least his apprentice seemed like a decent enough person. But they sure have changed, that canÂ´t be denied. After all, thatÂ´s why we formed the Chatos. And now I finally have a chance to see with my own eyes what it looks like on the inside"

The old man seems to grow strangely quiet, as though lost in thought.

The Yakora chuckles as he suspects that C'baoth might have quoted correctly, or possibly even "polished" the quote a bit.
"Yes yes, thatÂ´s how they see us. And if you asked a member of the Chatos about the Jedi, youÂ´d lilely hear something like "arrogant blind fools who have strayed from their purpose". Me, I try to stay neutral and judge each person by their own value. But IÂ´m not expecting the same treatment in return, sadly"
Adressing both his fellow prisoners, Haesh brings up a question.
"So, what affiliations do the two of you have? Jedi gone wrong? Chatos supporter? Or perhaps the Jedi arenÂ´t that picky about who they lock up"

Shoenab keeps his head down, casting a shadow over his face.
"I guess you could call me a Jedi gone wrong. I disagreed with a decision made by my master. He then turned and called me a traitor to the Order. Said that my sentence would have to 're-education'. I fought back, hard. Unfortunately, my master was a far better warrior than I was."
At this point, Shoenab turns his face upwards enough to allow the light to shine on the scar that runs across where eye sockets should've been.
"He made sure that I *learned my lesson*."

Zeke tips his hat to Carn. "I think we shall, good man." He winks and smiles, then replaces his cap.
He casually flips on the ignition, and the engine rumbles to life. Not bothering to check to make sure everyone is aboard, Zeke hits the accelerator, and the truck lurches down the road, rumbling along toward the prison.

The trash hauler moves down the path with surprising speed for its condition, but it would still take a few minutes to reach the prison.
--------
While the three prisoners conversed, a loud bang was heard from the door of Haesh's cell.
"Hey furball," came a voice, "the Jedi's here to see you now."
C'boath gives Haesh a look of encouragement and says, "Well, good luck to you, kid."

## Re: Chapter 1: Escape

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-17 13:05:00)

"Thanks. But save it for the Jedi"
Haesh gave C'baoth a quick smile before getting up. He wasnÂ´t joking. He was not at all thrilled of the entire idea of "reprogramming" people, and he meant to let the Jedi know that. All in a fashion as annoying as he could be off course. He walked up to the cell door.
"You can tell him to come in if he likes. Or perhaps the accomodations he felt appropriate for me isnÂ´t good enough for someone like him. In that case, perhaps you can take me to where he wishes to meet me"
Once again, the YakoraÂ´s voice was dripping with sarcasm.

As the door opens, the guard on the other side says in a frustrated voice, "Oh don't be such a smarta-"
"Ahem," the other guard interupts, who surprisingly turns out to be female, the first you've seen in the prison(apart from the Jastra). Both her and her frustrated companion hold blaster rifles.
"Please follow us," she says, in a genuinly respectful tone as she closes the door behind Haesh.

"Of course he does, blindy," the male guard sneers, but he allows Shoaneb out of his cell.
The female guard seems surprised by this, but says nothing.
Though Shoaneb tries to hide it, Haesh easily notices a slight wave of Shoaneb's hand.
"Lets go then," the male guard says, leading the way.

"I believe so," the female guard says, keeping behind the group with her blaster rifle ready.
After a few minutes of walking, you come to heavily armored door. The male guard looks for his key, opens the door, and instructs the two prisoners to get in.
---------
As the garbage hauler neared the main gate of the prison, it was waved through without too much inspection. Following the path and direction from the guards, you come to what appears to be a garage of some sort. After a moment to wait for the door to open, you enter.
You are now in the prison.
While there are several bins with trash in them, most of the garbage appears to be in piles below shoots. One guard comes near the hover, though not too close to inspect it, while another is further off, petting a rather feral looking canine tethered to the wall.
"I'll distract the guard, you let the others know its time," Carn whispers to Zeke as he's about to exit. Before exiting the hover, he looks around and finds two pairs of thick gloves.
"You might want one of these," he says, passing a pair to Zeke.
He then approaches the nearest guard and appears to engage him in small talk.

The room which Haesh enters is dimly lit and relatively non-descript, save for the rectangular table which sits in the centre and the two chairs on either side of it. On th farthest chair sits a human male dressed in Jedi robes. He is leaning back so that his face is obscured by shadows.
In the far corner, you can see the Bothan Jedi Jastra standing. She smiles at Haesh as he enters.

Haesh smiles upon seeing the Bothan again, and then continues to examine the rest of what he sees. He isnÂ´t overly impressed, intimidated or whatever he is supposed to be, by the poor lighting and the Jedi hiding his face. Supposing that the chairs opposite the Jedi are for him and Shoenab, he walks forward and takes a seat.
"So, you must be the big bad Jedi everyoneÂ´s been talking about"

Zeke slips the gloves on as he makes his way to the back of the truck. He throws open the back as the foul stench of the trash assaults his nose. "Rise and shine," he says quietly. "We have arrived."
Waving the smell away from his nose, he turns his back on the truck and looks around, making sure all is clear before the others climb out and expose themselves. Once there isn't anyone around to see or hear them, he waves them out.

Once it's all clear Ged unearths himself from the garbage and climbs out as quietly as he can.

The guard takes no notice as Ged climbs out of the trash. Ged manages to make it behind as surprisingly large mound of garbage before anyone seems to notice. However, Kyle is not as lucky. Looking over Carn's shoulder, he calls, "Hey, you!"
Thankfully, he seems to be fooled by the uniform Kyle is wearing, as the next words out of his mouth were, "Don't try to hide here to skip your shift. Get back on duty!"
------
"You're making me sound like a bad guy," the Jedi says to Haesh in a mock-concerned voice. He leans forward into the light, revealing a hard, angular, unshaven face. His head is shaved, and a rather impressive scar, possibly from a lightsaber, extends from just in front of his right temple, across the bridge of his nose, and ending on the lower left of his jaw. A smile is on his face, but his fierce green eyes betray any feeling of friendliness.
"My name is Vergon," he says.

"Nice to meet you Vergon, IÂ´m Haesh. And I have to apologize if I offended you. I merely recalled what others had told me about you"
Haesh diverts his eyes from Vergon for a moment to cast a friendly look at Jastra and then a questioning one back at her master.
"Is she not allowed to sit?"
The nature of the question was twofold. First, he really wanted to know if she wasnÂ´t *allowed* to sit. That would be an indication of some severe changes in the Order. Second, if she wasnÂ´t going to use the empty chair, then that would mean that someone else was expected, wouldnÂ´t it?

"I actually prefer to stand," Jastra says with a smile, "You know, keep the blood pumping."
"I was expecting her to sit," Vergon explains, and then gestures to Shoaneb, "But I don't think that she minds giving her seat to our other guest. I must say, I was under the impression I was interviewing only one Chatos operative."
Shoaneb feels two very different attitudes from the two Jedi: from the Bothan, a wary friendliness; from the Master, a surprised hostility.

"Why don't you tell us first, what kind of Jedi are you? The kind who hunts down any who disagree with the Order's *unique* view of the galaxy? Or are you the kind who figures that he, or she," looking at the Bothan, "can't do anything to stop it anyway and might as well go along with it? So, villain, or coward?"

Well, I suppose I started it. I am sorry."
"But," he says, his laugh dying down, "I'd rather be thought a coward, or even a villain, than know I turned my back on everything I once stood for."

Feeling that people with suppressed feelings had been able to express themselves, Haesh felt that he should offer something in the conversation.

Zeke is wary when the guard calls out to Kyle, but when he lets the other man pass, Zeke is relieved. So far, so good.
He ducked down out of sight and pulled out his tool kit, looking for the best way to sabotage the truck. He needed it to look real, but it also needed to be something that was simple to fix when the time came for their escape.

"If I may be so bold as to ask," Vergon says in a curious tone, "what precisely do you claim to stand for, hm?"
"And as for what I stand for, how about all of the above? Why can't we seek power for service? Serve the Republic for Democracy, hm?"
-------
Kyle makes his way towards the nearest door, requiring him to pass by Carn and the guard with which he was conversing. As he passes him, the guard nods to Carn and accompanies Kyle out, leaving only a single guard in the room who did not appear to be paying very close attention at all.
As the guard and Kyle walk the hallway on the other side of the door, the guard says, "Don't worry newbie, I won't report ya. I tried the same thing my first week. Almost lost my job."
Zeke finds that the machinery of the truck is not too complex, and easily finds an area which could be tampered with to disable the whole thing. Reversing this wouldn't be too difficult, though his experience tells Zeke that it probably wouldn't run quite as well afterwards.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-24 04:49:35)

*Now that was an unexpected question…*
Haesh wasnÂ´t at all the least surprised. Of course the Jedi master would ask him what he stood for, and then, most likely, he would try to make Haesh doubt those convinctions to make him "see the truth", or whatever he might call it. Well, well, two people could play this game.
"Really? Has the Order changed so much it canÂ´t remember its own code? If that is the case, then let me remind you of a few cornerstones in it: A Jedi should strive to conquer his arrogance, to honor the law, and the provide support, all areas in which it seems to me that you have failed"
Haesh pauses and shoots Jastra a look, trying to read anything of her face, before returning his gaze to her master.
"And as for your statements, how democratic do you consider your actions against me? Have I been accused of any crime? In that case, have I received a fair trial? And if the case of having a different opinion than that of the Jedi Order is a crime...well then I can only rest my case while finding a better word for it, because "Democracy" donÂ´t really cut it"

Shoenab looked (figuratively speaking) at the Jedi master as he asked his question.

Haesh notices a growning discomfort in Jastra over the rising hostilities in the room.
"You don't get it, do you? The Jedi have always had power, but what did they do with it? Sit in temples all day and meditate, only using the power when they were called for. Always reacting, never acting. Now, we are using our power to better the Republic.

"So, you seek control over the universe around you. What about control over yourself? Have you achieved that, yet? I doubt it. I can feel the darkness inside you. I can feel the anger struggling to gain control. Why do you resist? Isn't that what the Jedi have been trying to achieve? Power over the universe? Power over the individual?"
Looking over towards the Bothan, Jastra, Shoenab raises his face.
"Is that what you signed on for? Did you sign on to dominate the universe, Jedi? Or, did you sign on to serve and protect?"

"So so friend, take it easy. Even with your injuries, your sight seem to be clearer than that of the Jedi. Otherwise theyÂ´d realize how blurred the line of what distinguished them and the Sith have become. I had hoped it would be different, but now that IÂ´ve seen it with my own eyes, I feel even more certain that my decision to leave them was the right thing to do.

"That's enough," Vergon says roughly, looking at Jastra.
"Jastra, would you please wait outside?"
"Oh... y-yes, Master."
As the Bothan exits the room, Vergon looks harshly at the two Force-users left in the room.
"After all your high and mighty talks about how wrong the Jedi are, you would still... you forget that I am a Jedi Master. I couldn't care less if you lied to me.

While Haesh hadnÂ´t planned on being so annoying and cocky towards the Jedi, but given how the conversation had developed, he decided to change his mind. Adopting an indifferent face, his voice once again assumed a very calm tone.
"Master Vergon, no need to get upset. I have not been trying to manipulate anyone, merely extending an offer to your padawan, should she find the ways of the Jedi less appealing. She is free to leave the order if she chooses to, yes?"
He smiles a pleased smile, and continues in a calm tone.
"And why on earth would I attack or threaten you? You have done me no harm. Perhaps my accommodations were a bit low on standard, but IÂ´m not holding that against you.

Pleased to see that his tactics and mind games were working, but at the same time saddened that this was what had become of the Jedi, HaeshÂ´s only regret was that Jastra had not been present to see her masters last outrage. He hoped he hadnÂ´t put her into any trouble.
Nevertheless, he wasnÂ´t about to let the Jedi get away that easily. In the same calm and controlled voice, he spoke on.
"Manipulating and communicating is two very different things, master Vergon, or have the Jedi decided that the two are synonymous?"
He had to admit he was a little surprised when the Jedi went as far as to actually threaten him with a weapon. He would not give in to fear though, his training with Count Dooku had taught him much about fear and the Dark Side, and how to conquer them. He took a deep breath and steadied himself. He would do what he could to avoid combat, but he would be ready for it.
"As for being a master of the Force...I can certainly see that you have begun to explore a wider spectrum of it. But in the words of a true master of the Light: "Anger, Fear and Agression, the Dark Sides of the Force are they""

Vergon was practically seething with rage.
"Now listen to me, you-"
Before he could finish his sentence, however, a loud siren interrupted him. While this in itself was disturbing enough, seeing as they were in a prison, what followed was, for every force sensitive, much worse.
It was hard to describe. All that could be said about the feeling was that there was something fundamentally wrong with it. It ripples across the entirety of your being, a wave of revulsion and evil.
Jastra barges through the door, obviously having felt it to.
"Master!"
"I know," Vergon says, having gone from furious to calm in a moment.
"Jastra, take these two back to the cells. I'm going to find out what's going on."
-----
By the garbage hauler, the siren could be heard and the disturbance in the Force could be felt. The man whom Drex was creeping up upon awoke with a start, but had little time to react before Drex's blade had deftly severed an artery, leaving him a bloody corpse on the floor. The canine by his side awoke and immeadiately charged at Drex, but he was swift enough to get out of the way of its teeth and claws.
As Zeke feels the disturbance in the Force, he also notices that Carn must have felt it as well, only his reaction was much greater. Carn was on his knees, shaking, cluching the sides of his head as though trying to keep some foul sound out.
------
In the halls, the guard with Kyle reacts almost immeadiately to the siren by pulling out a comlink.
"What's going on? Yes. Alright. Right away sir."
He turns to Kyle and says, "It appears we've got a jailbreak on our hands, newbie. Come with me, we've got something important to do."

At the final outburst of the Jedi Master, Haesh felt that perhaps it was time to lay off for a while. He was out to taunt and goad, not get himself killed. Before he could think of something else though, something struck him.
It was a feeling of dread and evil, and he could not find good words to put it in. The old phrase "I have a bad feeling" didnÂ´t quite do the job, this was far more. Looking to Jastra as she came to escort him and Shoenab back to their cells, he gave her a puzzled look.

The guard leads Kyle down a series of hallways and corridors, eventually stopping at a non-descript door with a single guard watching it, looking very nervous.
"We've got to make sure that the confiscated items room is secure," the guard leading Kyle explained, "Otherwise, who knows what these crooks could get their hands on."
------
"Follow me," Jastra says, leading the way back to the cells, with the two guards behind the Force using prisoners.
Haesh is unable to determine what caused the feeling, but gets the distubing feeling that they were moving closer to it.

Shoenab nodded his head in agreement as he walked alongside Haesh and behind Jastra. Part of Shoenab wanted to find a quiet place to sit and meditate. Try to get a feeling for the disturbance he'd felt earlier.
"He seems to anger quite easily, Jastra was it? Also, I wonder if anyone's figured out what that was a moment ago?"

When Zeke heard the sirens, his head shot up, coming into hard contact with the underside of the truck. It was quickly followed by a dull, throbbing pain, and a disturbance in the Force. He climbed out from under the truck, and glanced at Carn, who was on his knees and not doing well, by the look of it.
He hurried to Carn's side. "What's wrong? I mean, I know what's wrong, but what, um, why was it so much worse for you?" he asked, more out of politeness than actual concern.

"I know he can be a bit rough," Jastra says as she leads to way to the cells, "but he really isn't that bad. He's just dedicated."
"I don't have any clue what that was," she replies to Shoaneb, "but it can't be good."
The Force tells Shoaneb to follow the Bothan Jedi, despite the growing danger.
------
Carn seems to be unable to put together coherent speech.
"I... he... no, don't... AAAAH!"
His scream is punctuated by a rapid, chaotic shift in his form. Within the span of a few seconds, he goes from dark haired to light, male to female, human to reptilian to insectoid, and all back again, until eventually he begins to revert to the form of the Clawdite Pol Virten, curled into the fetal position on the floor.
"What's... happening..."

Zeke nervously glanced around before pulling Whatever-His-Name-Was to the side of the truck. He kept an eye out for anyone who might've seen them, hoping they hadn't blow the mission so early.
He turned back to What's-his-name, and said, calmly. "It's going to be all right. Reach out and feel the Force. Let it calm you, draw you in. Take a deep breath and reach out."

"Mostly its weaponry," the guard says to Kyle, "And we don't want any of this to get into prisoner's hands, or else we could have a full scale riot."
"You're right about needing more help. Others should be coming this way soon."

The shapechanger breathes deeply several times, and appears to regain some control, although he still seems to be shaking slightly.
"Whatever that was," he says, "but it definitly wasn't good."
Apart from the dead guard on the floor in front of Drex, the only one not apart of the group present was the barking canine chained to the wall, futily trying to reach any of the intruders.
-------
Rushing down halls behind Jastra, Haesh, Shoaneb, and the rest of the group come to a abrupt stop. In front of them stand two figures. One is the hunched, elderly form of C'boath, his eyes unfocused and a rope around his left wrist. The rope was held in the left hand of the second figure, cloaked and hooded, whose face was hidden by a mask depicting a snarling beast of some sort.
The hooded figure held a blaster in its right hand, and raised it towards the group, saying, "Get out of my way."

Drex was not sure what was going on with the Shape shifter and Zeke and the Canine wasn't helping the situation.
Drex uses his Vibro-Blade to lop a piece of flesh form the Dead Guard and throws it to the Beast.
"Eat it and shut up you useless meat bag otherwise I will put you down."
Drex then searches the dead Guard for anything of use then Drex slips the Special Datapad into his pocket before lifting him up and hiding the Dead Guard in the refuse of the Garbage Truck.

Haesh pulled up short behind Jastra as he spotted the two men in front of him. It looked like C´Boath was a captive, but looks could be deceiving, he if anyone should know. He had put a great deal of effort into giving himself an appearance that was ever changing. Now he decided it was time to be more serious though, and he felt he´d had enough weapons pointed at him today.
Moving past Jastra, he shot the Bothan a look.
"You wouldn´t happen to have my lightsaber, would you?"
Without waiting for an answer, he formed a sphere with his hands, shooting them forward and releasing a powerful blast of Force energy against the man holding the gun.
"C'Boath, get down!"
((Use the Force +9 to activate Force Blast, spending a Force Point to increase the roll. If Jastra has my lightsaber, I´ll use Move Light Object to pull it to my hand and ignite it, hopefully being able to use Deflect againt any blaster shots.

Coming to a halt at the same time as Jastra, Haesh, and the guards, Shoenab directed his face towards the person holding C'Boath prisoner. Hearing the demand from the armed individual with the *scary* mask, Shoenab simply smirks.
"Yeah, that'll happen."
Motioning his hand in front of him, Shoenab timed his attack to go after Haesh's, hoping to capitalize on the other's attack as a distractor. As soon as Haesh launches his attack, Shoenab's hand grips empty air and lifts into the sky.

As the beast happily chews the meat Drex throws at it, Drex discovers the man's identification, as well as a stun baton and blaster pistol set to stun.
While trying to get the datapad into the mans pocket, the datapad, wet with blood, slips from Drex's hands and lands loudly on the floor.
-------
The masked figure goes flying back, only to be caught by Shoaneb's use of the Force, and sent flying back towards them.
The guards raise their weapons in response to Haesh's sudden movement. "Wait!" Jastra cries out as Haesh's lightsaber flies out from her robes. Haesh ignites it in time to respond to the first shot, but the second stun bolt gets through. As though in retaliation, the masked figure flies straight into the second guard, knocking both down.
Jastra can only look on in shock, while the masked figure remains still on the floor.
((*Shoaneb did 11 damage to both the guard and masked enemy. Haesh did 20 points of damage, and rolled a natural twenty, so Force Blast returns to his power suit.

Haesh catches his lightsaber in flight, igniting it in a reversed grip, sending a blue beam of light trailing behind him as he sweeps the blade into the path of the guards blast. He grins a little as a second stun bolt passes his defenses and scratches his shoulder, sending small jolts of pain through him.
As the masked man comes flying through the air - Shoenab´s work, he suspects - and collides with the trigger-happy guard, he straightens, and with his lightsaber still ignited, gets down on one knee, feeling the masked man for a pulse. He keeps a wary eye on the guards, especially the one on the floor.
"Please don´t do that again"
Curious to know the masked mans identity, he searches for a way to remove his mask.

As Haesh removes the grotesque mask from the figure's face, he learns two things: one, that the figure is in fact a female, with pale skin and dark, sunken eyes; and two, that she is still very much conscious and is wearing a beastial grin.
Almost immeadiatly, a great wave of Force energy pushes everyone back. The guard which had been hit by the woman now lay with his limbs bent at unnatural angles, while the second guard and Jastra are pushed into the wall. Haesh and Shoaneb are pushed further down the hallway, but are otherwise unharmed.
Rising to her feet, the woman gives a rather frightening chuckle as she draws a lightsaber and ignites the crimson blade.
------
The guards and Kyle hear approaching footsteps, but are relieved to discover it is another guard. Or at least one who appears like a guard. Kyle immeadiatly recognizes Ged, though a quick look from his ally tells him to keep quiet.
-------
Meanwhile, in the garage, two guards enter, looking out of breath. Seeing the blood soaked corpse and the man with a vibroblade standing over it, they immeadiatly reach for their pistols.
"Halt!" one cries out. Neither appear to have noticed Pol or Zeke behind the garbage truck.

Shoenab feels the power of the Force flow through him as he picks up and slams the masked assailant into one of the guards. As Haesh leans over and pulls off the mask, he is as shocked as anyone to notice that the assailant is a girl. He's even more surprised by the fact that she's still conscious.
*What kind of power does this one hold to resist such an onslaught?*
Finally, he feels the power of the woman's Force Repulse knocking them all back. The laughter filling the air sends a chill down his spine.
*Ok, then, let's do this.*
Knowing that the others might help keep the woman distracted, Shoenab still ketp his eyes on the woman. He wouldn't lose his sight because he needed it to help out. This woman needed to go down, and while several means were at his disposal, he thought one in particular might help out the most right now.
Reaching his hand out towards the female, Shoenab saw the flow of energy in the woman's body. Energy coming from the heart and being directed everywhere else in the body. He saw the electrical impulses of the brain, streaming down the neurons and into the muscles, and back again from the muscles into the brain. That would be his line of attack. He reached out with the Force and begun increasing the flow of neural impulses from the body to the brain. Then, in one motion of the hand, he forced the neurons to register, all at once, and all at the maximum capacity.

"All right," Zeke says to the shapeshifter. "Just rest here. Don't go too far. We may have to get out of here in a hurry."
When the clattering of a datapad reaches his ears, Zeke glances over his shoulder at Drex and then the incoming guards. Thinking quickly, he runs out from behind the truck, waving at the guards. "It was just an accident!" he says as he points to the fallen guard. "If there's a jailbreak, you're going to be needed elsewhere. I know first aid if the guy needs it. Go!" he said as he jogged toward Drex and the stabbed guard.

As Haesh pulls of his assailant´s mask, he is slightly surprised that it was in fact a woman. He was genuinely shocked though, when he felt the enormous blast of telekinetic energy that lifted him of his feet, and sent him flying down the hallway.
As he slumped to the ground, he lost the grip on his lightsaber as he turned himself into a sideroll, coming up on all four, facing back at the woman, who now had a crimson lightsaber blade in her hand. He could feel anger flowing within him, and he though back to the sessions he had had with Count Dooku, and how to control the rage, and make it his own, instead of the other way around.
*So this is how it´s going to be played then…bring it on*
Taking a few quick paces, he reached out with his hand and called his lightsaber back to him. Spinning the blade around once in his hand, he launched himself into a Force-propelled leap and brought the Jedi weapon down in a two-handed, overhead blow against his opponent.

"Wanna play, then?" She taunts, blocking Haesh's lightsaber with ease.
The remaining guard fires a shot at the woman, who deflects it without even paying close attention. Jastra, having come out of her horrified stupor, draws her own lightsaber and stammers, "Y-you are under arrest in th-the name of the-"
"Oh, shut up," the woman says, bringing her lightsaber up to Jastra's throat.

The assassin rises a few inches off the floor, only to be forced into the wall of the hallway with considerable force. The attack would have knocked out, possibly even killed, a regular person, but this mysterious woman simply smiles after regaining her footing.
"That is enough," a voice from down the hallway forcefully states. A voice belonging to Jedi Master Vergon.
The Jedi walks toward the battle with slow, purposeful steps. As soon as he reaches Shoaneb, he stops.
"You protected my Padawan," he mutters too quietly for anyone else to hear, "And its only for that reason am I doing this."
With that he shoves a wrapped item into Shoanebs hands.
"Now get out. And don't kill anyone on the way."

Haesh smiles as the woman crashes into the wall in a sound move. He has to wonder who she is though. He fought destroyer droids during the war that took less effort to kill than her. And he didnÂ´t appear to be even close to getting her weary.
In the back of his head he registers Vergon coming down the hallway. While he might not have been particularly fond of the Jedi, Haesh had to admit he felt a little better with a master around. Right now though, he decided to ignore him.
He brought his lightsaber up in face height, held straight out in front of him with the point aimed for the mysterious woman. He kept his distance, but was ready to strike if threatened.

Unwrapping the item given to him, Shoaneb discovers that it is a lightsaber. Not his original one-that had been confiscated long ago and probably destroyed- but one that would function well enough.
Haesh remembers having seen this face somewhere before. He recognises her as a bounty hunter, one that apparently disappeared after the Republic outlawed her trade, though he has no recollection of what her name was.
"Call me Nashtah," the woman says with a grin, "Its a good a name as any."
Then with the speed of the beast that is her namesake, Nashtah charges forward. She easily she easily bats aside Haesh's lightsaber, but is unable to get an attack in before Vergon, of all people, rushes into her, the strength of his lightsaber blow sending her several inches back.
"GO!" he shouts out.
-------
"Sir," one of the guards says, coming forward, blaster still raised, "I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step back."
It is obvious that neither guard has the intention of leaving.
------
"Hey, stop right-" a voice from somewhere beyond Kyle's view says, only to be followed by the sound of a body hitting the floor. Hard.
Around the corner, a Trandoshan in prisoner's clothes dashes. Seeing the assembly of guards, he rushes forward brandishing a makeshift club. The mad look in his eye makes negotiations an unlikely prospect.

Deciding that the time to goad the Jedi was over, Haesh acknowledges Vergon with a small nod, and then shouts over his shoulder to Shoenab.
"Get C'Baoth on his feet, we´re leaving"
Raising his lightsaber again, placing himself between his two companions and Nashtah, he starts to move backwards down the hallway, eyes darting from her, to Vergon, to Jastra. In a tone that is no longer sarcastic and mocking, he eyes the Jedi Master.
"Are you certain you can handle her alone, master Vergon? It is nothing wrong with asking for help"

Shoaneb finds that C'Boath isn't difficult to lift. In fact, he seems full conscious and capable of standing, but seems to be completely non-responsive to any attempts to communicate.
Jastra aids in leading C'Boath, though she seems quite confused at this turn of events.

He turns around to look at Jastra.
"I would like to to go back in there and see if he needs help, but something tells me that master Vergon would not appreciate that"
He shut off his lightsaber and replaced it at his belt.
"I hope you understand that I can´t tell you were we´re going. But if, in the future, you feels a need to seek me or my friends out, you still have a blaster that belongs to me.

She draws the weapon which had been confiscated from Haesh, waving it back and forth in a semi-mocking fashion.
"If you've got a saber, I doubt that this will make you much more dangerous," she whispers, handing it back to him.
"I'm sorry, sir," the guard says, "but it is standard procedure to not allow anyone to leave in such a situation."
He makes no aggressive movements, but it is hard not to notice he still grips his rifle tight.

Zeke peeked around the corner of the truck and picked off a shot at the guard Drex *wasn't* attacking. As soon as the shot left his gun, he made a run for it to the front of the truck. "Snipers! We've got snipers! Take cover!"

Haesh replies the grin and takes the blaster. It isn´t really the firepower he needs, but the thing also carries a lot of sentimental value. Ignoring the guard for a moment, he holsters the weapon next to his lightsaber.
"And here I was hoping to use that as an excuse to have you seek me out later. But I hope that if you want to do that later, you´ll find a way to contact me"
Turning back to the guard, he offers a doubting look.
"Well I was just ordered by a Jedi master to get out of here, and I have another one here to make sure that I do, so I guess I don´t really give a crap about your procedures"

"Its all right," Jastra says to the confused guard. He remains where he is, not fully convinced, but not doing anything to stop anyone.

Zeke's shot passes through a gap between both guards, just barely missing them. Drex has more luck, bringing down the wounded guard with a slash to the gut.
The remaining guard backs away, firing in fear, and missing every shot.

Zeke took a calming breath and let the others go. There was no sense in chasing after them. He just hoped that Drex saw it the same way, or things were going to get very messy very quickly.
He stayed by the front of the truck out of sight, and waited, just waited.

"Someone has to stay here," the guard says to Ged with slight annoyance.
"You go, I'm following my orders."
------------
Drex gives the fleeing guard one last glance before shrugging, sheathing his vibroblade, and returning to hiding the body.
"I guess we need to make room for another, huh?" he says with a smile.
"There's no time to joke!" Pol says, "That guard is bound to call for reenforcements, we're gonna have to pull out!"
He pulls out a comlink and says into it, "Deng, you here me? We might need a quick getaway, over."

"Don't call me that, you freak! You know I hate it when you call me that!" The interrupting voice comes from the comlink in Pol's hand.
"Oh, fine," Pol says, rolling his eyes, "Deng*ar*, get your butt down here before we all end up dead."
Putting away the comlink, Pol says, "Deng's our getaway driver."

"By the way, my name's Ged," he adds before turning back in the direction they're headed.

Ged, Kyle, Haesh, and the others pass by several hurrying guards, but none of them seem to pay any mind to them. It would appear that the disguises Ged and Kyle wore were working.
Shoaneb, who was leading C'boath along, fell back to keep closer with Haesh. He whispers to him, keeping a suspicious eye on the two who led them.

Zeke climbs into the driver's seat as he waits for the others to arrive. He makes a show of checking the readouts, in case anyone was watching, but his eyes were focused on the doors instead. He glances at Pol. "So why are we not taking this garbage heap outta here? Too noticeable?"

After a few minutes of navigating the hallways, Ged and the others finally reach the garage where they would make their escape. They find Zeke and Pol sitting in the front, while Drex is around back. Pol casts a frantic look their way, before realizing who they are and calming down.
"Well, come on," he says, obviously agitated. He eyes Shoaneb and the stunned C'Boath.
"How many freeloaders did you bring with you?"

"No, I don't think so."
The voice came from the direction of the vehicle entrance. Standing there were two men. One, a guard, was guiding in an armored vehicle to block the escape route, while the one who had spoken, wearing a unique uniform which seemed to denote some sort of rank, stood slowing clapping, apparently mocking them.
"Bravo," he says with a cocky grin. As he speaks, the guard which had been driving the armored vehicle came out, and two more guards entered from the same place Ged and the others had moments before. All had rifles drawn.
"I have to say, this is one of the most odd escape plans I've ever seen. But I'm afraid it was all for naught. Surrender. If you resist arrest, these men have been authorized to use lethal force, and I assure you, more are on the way."

Zeke grimaced as he floored the accelerator, trying to beat the armored truck to the door. He didn't want to make it, just block the armored vehicle--he was aware that he still had allies on this side of the door. He was never going to leave someone behind again.

As he heard a voice come from behind, Haesh spun into a low, crouching position, his lightsaber flying from his belt and snapping to life in his hand. When no imminent danger appeared, he straightened, but kept the weapon lit in his hand. He watched as more armed men came into their view, and drew a deep breath to prepare himself.
It seemed pretty obvious to him that these men were not with the Jedi. If so, they would not try to stop them from getting away, would they? He cast a quick glance at C'Baoth. It was him the mysterious attacker from before had been after, and it seemed like a qualified guess to say these guys were no different.
Before he had any chance to open his mouth however, the speeder that they were all supposed to have escaped in blasted forward with full speed. It was hard to say if he was trying to stop the exit from being blocked, or simply trying to get out, but Haesh rooted for the latter and sprung into action. Expecting full chaos to break loose soon, he darted towards the two soldiers that had just entered, leaping at them with a determined assault.

Zeke's vehicle rockets forward, ending up halfway out the exit before being crashed into from the side by the armored vehicle. Both vehicles look severly damaged from the crash, and the trash hauler seems to have been pinned between one side of the exit and the front of the armored vehicle. A slight gap seems to have formed beneath the two vehicles, creating a possible escape route, albiet one that would leave whomever decided to use it very open to attack.
Zeke and the guard are unharmed from the crash, both having escaped from their vehicles at the last moment.
Haesh's sudden attack surprises the two guards, but not too surprised to react. They both fire off a shot at the charging paladin, distracting him from his attack.
The head guard smiles as he says, "Bad move."
*((Haesh missed, but the two guards did a combined 23 points of damage, no condition track movement.
EDIT: Haesh's roll to deflect the first shot succeeded, but the second one failed, so he only took 11 damage.
That counted as the surprise round, I guess. The initiative count is:
Drex-25
Head Guard-19
Ged-14
Kyle-13
Zeke-12
Shoaneb & C'Boath-8

Drex is the first to act, charging forward with a graceful strike from his vibroblade aimed at the nearest guard, who happens to be near the crashed vehicles. The surprised guard goes barely avoids the deadly blow, but the terror in his eyes shows he knows all to well what sort of situation he is in.
The chief guard seems to have a different stategy from his collegues. Pulling a small metal cylinder from his waistband, he flicks his wrist to bring out a snap baton. He moves confidently towards Zeke, as though daring him to act.
Ged rushes towards the first pile of garbage available, using the refuse as cover as he pulls out his rifle.
*((I autopiloted Ged and Drex, but Mandalore PM'd me to say that he should be able to post soon.
Drex is in melee with one of the guards. Everyone else is about two move actions away from melee range of any guard, except Zeke, who is one move action away from the cocky bast- er, head guard. As Ged proved, the piles of garbage are large enough to provide some sort of cover.))*

The soldiers responds faster than Haesh had expected, and the Yakora find himself met by blasterfire as he advances. Batting the first bolt away easily sends him into an off-balance spin, and he barely catches the second bolt mere inches from his head, effectively blocking his strike. Regaining his footing, he reverses the grip of his lightsaber and extends both hands outwards in a pushing motion.

Zeke moves towards the head guard confidently, apparently sure that his skills in melee combat would out-do his opponent's. He engages in an offensive, but is unable to land a hit on the man. Every swipe of Zeke's saber hits nothing but air as his opponent gracefully dodges.
The guards seem to have collected themselves, and open fire. Of the two whom Haesh attacked, one stood his ground and fired, while the other ran towards a trash heap to gain some protection, firing at Shoaneb. Shoaneb is hit hard, and cries out in pain as the blaster bolt catches him in the shoulder. The guards at the other end of the room fired as well, with the one which had been attacked by Drex retreating and opening fire, while the other moved slowly towards another garbage heap and opened fire on Ged. Neither of these shots are effective.
Drex seems to be pushing the offensive on his foe, but does not seem to be landing any hits. From his confident and offensive posture, however, it wouldn't be too much to assume he was playing with the man.
The head guard seems to have decided he has been on the defensive too long. He begins returning blows to Zeke, though neither seem to be gaining any upper hand.
Ged fires at the guard which had been attacking him. The bolts from his rifle barely miss the man, forcing him to stop retreating and focus on returning fire.
*((Nobody was hit this round(assuming Haesh uses deflect) except for Ged's target and Shoaneb, who received a critical hit for 32 damage(!), forcing him a step down the condition track.

Zeke seems to have finally gotten some sort of advantage in his duel, and is pushing the offensive.
Shoaneb's injury seems to have caused some sort of damage, as his right arm hangs limply at his side, barely keeping hold of his saber. He pulls C'boath away from the fighting so that they could both gain some cover in the junk.
Kyle's shot strikes true, hitting the guard square in the chest. He goes down before anyone could react.

Haesh almost felt bad for the single guard remaining. He must realize as well that his situation is quite poor. Still, he was sure the man would not hesitate to strike him down in a similar situation, and that if allowed, he would cause more trouble for Haesh and his friends.
Bringing his saber up over his head, the Yakora turned into a spinning motion, striking a decisive blow towards the neck of the other, determined to make his pain short.

The remaining guards are beginning to look desperate, with one huddled behind trash locked in a firefight with Ged, and the other trying not to be sliced to pieces by Drex, his panicked shots barely missing the man.

The guard in melee with Zeke makes the first slip up of their duel: overestimating his opponents movements, his snap baton strikes out too far to Zeke's left, leaving him exposed to a counterattack.

Ged shoulders his rifle and follows suit, followed shortly by Pol, who had returned to a human form without anyone noticing.

Drex looks at the other guards and back at the Head Man.
"Secondly tell your superiors what you need to but I would suggest a headline of terrorist killed in failed prison break attempt would sound nice and look good on your part. Plus would make us feel far more comfortable about not being hunted."
Drex leans in a bit so the Head Guard would only hear what he said next.

He stood with his back to the group, facing the prison gates. He wanted to be sure no one was following. "And if no one has any objections, why don't you all get on board."

"Well it is refreshing to have a droid around, but then who's to say are lightsaber happy friends decapitating poor guards isn't just as logical and peaceful?"
Drex boards the ship as he offers his opinion, more or less an observation, of the days events. As he boards Drex decides to walk about the ship to get the layout of the ship, after all he who doesn't plan for the worst is simply a fool.

"Oh, sir," the droid says with what might be a laugh, "I am not Master Dengar. I am PK-5L, glad to make your aquaintance."
Pol rolls his eyes and guestures towards the ship. "Go ahead," he says, "I'm still stationed here, I can make my way back on my own." He aids C'Boath and Shoaneb into the ship, where PK-5L takes over, presumably escorting Shoaneb to some sort of medical attention.
As Drex wanders about the ship, he finds the inside is similar to the outside: covered in what seems a perpetual layer of filth. After walking through the ship and becoming aquainted with the layout, he finds what appears to be the entrance to the bridge/cockpit. The door is locked, and as he approaches, a mechanical voice says in a pleasant monotone, "Please present identification. If you have no identification, *get the frak lost*. Have a nice day."

"Sorry about that," comes a muffled voice from behind Drex. If he cared to investigate, Drex would have found that the voice originated from a humaniod figure wearing a grubby set of overalls and a welding mask. Thick boots and grease covered gloves covered the rest of the being, making sure that no skin was visible.
"Captain Dengar programed it to say that," it explained, "and he's one hell of a good programer, 'cause I can't for the life of me figure out how to make it stop."
The figure laughed and extended a hand.
"Name's Rhen. Co-pilot, mechanic, and general muscle."

"I suppose we should head out then," Ged says as he enters the ship. He motions over his shoulder for the others to follow.

Kyle holsters his blaster and follows Ged up into the ship while whispering to himself, "Fierfek, what have I gotten myself into?".

((Alright, just assuming everyone's getting onboard...))
With everyone on, the ship begins to rise away from the planets surface. Within minutes, the ship has left Eriadu's gravitational pull without being followed and is in position to make a hyperspace jump.
"Hey, everyone," a gruff voice comes over the shipwide speaker system.
"This is your captain speaking. Looks like we're gunna be in hyperspace for a while, so lets lay down some ground rules. Nobody bugs me. Period. I don't want to see your faces for the whole trip, so nobody comes into the cockpit unless I say so.
Apart from that, just don't kill eachother. The last thing I need is a corpse stinkin' up my ship."
With that, the voice cut out. Moments later, the ship enters hyperspace.
