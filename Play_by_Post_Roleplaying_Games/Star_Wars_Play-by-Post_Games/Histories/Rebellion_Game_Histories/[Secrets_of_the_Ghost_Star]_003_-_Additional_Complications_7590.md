'Lady Eelya.' The Grand Admiral acknowledges the Twi'lek with a sardonic smile twisting his features. 'It is such a pleasure to see you again. I came, of course, to greet your new citizens, and welcome them to this little home of ours.'
'And,' he adds, spreading his arms wide, 'to extend welcome into our Imperial enclave for those that would like a home there.'
'Ahh...' Eelya's response is said lightly, barely more than an exhalation of breath. A ripple seems to spread from the council, a collective tensing. Kar shifts his stance and below his waistline his weapon hand flexes.

Rising steadily to his feet, Tanis offers a lowered head-bow to the newly arrived Imperials directed specifically at their clear leader. The ripple that moves through the locals is not unfelt, and helps to prompt the mercenary to act.
"A pleasing kindness, Grand Admiral. And a generous offer too, for which I and my companions thank you." The human makes another smaller head-bow as acknowledgement of the offer. "Though given our newness to this place and the resultant insecurities we cannot help but feel, you will forgive us if we choose to remain with these people who first saved us from our own ignorance of the dangers of the station. To leave them now would surely be lacking in proper decorum. Assuming, however that your offer remains open, who knows where we find ourselves sir. We as yet are still learning what these good folk have to teach."

Isshkazza composes himself from his initial surprise of this Grand Admiral, the empire had never been so gracious to his people in the past. It leaves reason for suspicion and doubt, but this is not Isshkazza`s arena ..... yet. Allow those who do well with words to do their part. Isshkazza stands tall his imposing figure will speak for him. Isshkazza will wait listen and prepare if his part should come, with the last thought Isshkazza takes measure of those around him.

Ben nods in thanks of the offer even though he probably would never take him up on it. Thinking to himself *"Got to admit that I am surprised. I am not used to seeing a Imperial being so graceous to others."* Ben will keep to himself and let those with better skills then him handle the talking.*"Best to leave this to cooler heads then mine."*He thinks to himself.*"Last time I opened my mouth I was judged a fool. Don't want that again."*

Yvanus rests both his hands on the shoulder sling attached to his rifle as he eyes the imperial contingent. The mandalorian was well familiar with imperial displays of power, and this Grand Admiral wasn't attempting to be subtle about the show.
Smirking, Yvanus only half listens to Tanis's eloquent speech, instead focusing the rest of his attention on how the Imperials have arrayed themselves, and how well-armed they are, in case the situation takes a violent turn.

The Grand Admiral nods an acknowledgement to Tanis.
'Admirable. If you change your mind, Lady Eelya and the rest of this *esteemed* council know how to contact me. And should you visit our enclave, ask to speak to Grand Admiral Arklyte.' The man manages to make the word "esteemed" apply all sorts of things about the mixed-species council, excepting of course its traditional meaning.
'Grand Admiral, are we still to trade on the set date, or have you brought your goods early?' Eelya asks, ignoring the slight and moving on before its implications can sink in and be responded to by hotter heads. She spreads her arms wide. 'I am afraid you have caught us yet unprepared, and we will need a little time to organise matters if you wish to conduct our business today.'
'Lieutenant?' Arklyte says, turning his head to look at the young officer beside him.
'Sir?' He asks, straightening.
'Signal for our trade goods to be brought round.'
'Yes sir.'
'I do not mind waiting, Lady Eelya.' Arklyte states as the lieutenant speaks quietly into a comlink.

Yvanus finds a wall to hold up, one that offers him a fair view of the proceedings while decently obscuring him from the imperials. A memory rises, unbidden, to the fore of his thoughts, causing him to trace the partial imperial crest covering half his face and shaved scalp before he recognizes the motion.
Content to simply observe, the mandalorian finds himself with a growing sense of disquiet. The Imperials were pressing for some unknown reason, and in his past experience that never bode well for those being pressed.

Ben finds a place to wait untill he is to leave with the others. Standing against a wall out of the way. He continues to wait for something to happen. Thinking to himself. *"Well maybe they just desided they needed the supplys sooner rather then later. I know a couple of Hutts that would love this place plenty of opertunity here, they would be running the place in a month."*

With that initial contact done, and even done without weapons being drawn, Tanis lets himself look a touch more relaxed. The former merc moves with a relaxed pace to the corridor wall, settled back a touch. There he will wait, look pleasantly at ease, and move when trouble presents itself.

Grand Admiral Arklyte takes the opportunity to look over all the assembled people properly for the first time. His gaze passes over everyone until it reaches the zabrak En, at which point frown lines instantly appear and his cheeks blotch slightly.
'I hadn't thought to see you again so soon.' He practically spits, then casts around for something or someone else - he finds his target in Anon. 'Or your pet.'
'The pleasure is once again all mine, Grand Admiral.' En answers with a nod and a smile.
'Lady Eelya, are you aware that you are harbouring a criminal?' Arklyte says, voice rising. 'This *individual* caused damage to my Enclave and my property.'
'If by "property" you mean those toy soldiers in their gleaming armour,' En retorts, 'yes I did.'
The Grand Admiral's jaw clenches. Eelya looks sharply at En.
'You never mentioned this.' She accuses, looking slightly worried by the revelation.
'It didn't seem relevant. It was self-defense, I'll have you know - they were going to lock us up.'
'For trespassing.' Arklyte snaps, glaring blaster bolts at the tattoo'ed Zabrak.
En snorts derisively.
'That's easy for you to say. How were we to know that corridor was off limits?'

Sill giving way to the hopes that this will be handled by the negotiators Isshkazza waits though I keeps a hand close to his bowcaster ready for a fight. Isshkazza scans over the storm troopers watching for signs of the same his gaze resting on the Admirable watching closely for any signs of a signal to his men. Admirable also looks over his friends noting which of them are ready and which may need protecting.

Ben starts to notice the hostility between the two men. Thinking to himself that these two had better comm down or there was going to be trouble. *"Not a good form to be stepping on peoples toes. Especially when the toes belong to Imperials."*  He stays where he is, not to worried that the situation will be resloved with out violance. Arms crossed over his chest just waiting.*"The Adrimal looks like a smart man I don't think he will start anything here."*
(OCC: Ben is thinking these thing not specking them.)

Yvanus cants his head at an angle, running an appraising glance over En and his companion as if he were seeing them for the first time. Although appearing calm, the atmosphere within the corridor had the mandalorian preparing to leap into action, much like a coiled spring.
"A dangerous scholar... Well, that certainly is different." Yvanus says with an ironic smirk, speaking to no one in particular.

'I am sorry Grand Admiral,' Eelya says decisively, 'but these two are guests and have been offered our hospitality. We cannot simply hand them over.'
'You would test our friendship this way?' Arklyte growls, red in the face.
Grorrl steps forward slightly to shield Eelya, to whom he owes a life debt. His movement immediately earns reactions from the stormtroopers - rifles are raised. In turn, the representatives of Gilded Cage ready their own weapons.
Eelya immediately slips past Grorrl, patting his arm. Arklyte, regaining a measure of control in the face of the rapidly escalating situation, gestures with a hand for his men to lower their arms.
'From the facts we've been presented it seems like a simple albeit tragic misunderstanding, Grand Admiral. We must give our guests fair hearing. Surely the Empire understands the importance of a fair trial?'
Arklyte grimaces, teeth clenched. After a moment, his expression becomes resigned.
'Oh, very well.' He says. 'We will do it your way. These two must remain at Gilded Cage until the end of our trade agreements, during which period I will send for our security footage. After the close of the usual proceedings we will hold a trial. We will agree upon finer details during our discussions later. Acceptable?'
'Acceptable.' Eelya agrees.
'If you're interested,' En comments wryly, 'I find it acceptable too.'
At this point a further group of Imperials arrives in the corridor. Four more stormtroopers escort non-military personnel who are controlling ten small hoversleds laden with crates and boxes.
Eelya smiles at their arrival, and the tension building up between the two groups begins to palpably dissipate.
'Well then,' she says, gesturing to the door, 'shall we?'
---
Several hours later the Imperials have installed themselves in the canteen, and citizens of Gilded Cage have brought out their own goods. Trade ranges in importance from the barter of community resources to exchanges of personal goods between individuals. Mostly, items offered are dull and practical - food, powerpacks, medkits, glowrods, tools, components, datacards... Occasional items of interest such as art or exotic devices are available, but tend to command a far lower value than they rightfully deserved thanks to the grim realities of life on the station. The busy hall is full of energy, and if it weren't for the presence of armed personnel on both sides it could be said to be a jolly affair. As sad as the fact is, this is clearly one of very few social events on the calendar for the two communities.
En and Anon have been confined to their rooms for the duration of the trading period, but the rest of the guests are welcome to be present and even participate if they wish.
((OOC: If you're after anything, make an in-game post that both states your desired item as well as what you're willing to put up for the trade. If not... well, post anyway, that you're just browsing or something. After that I'll explain the results and move things on.))

Isshkazza scans through the iteams doubtful to find bowcaster ammo but makes a round or two anyway. Isshkazza gives obvious space to any storm trooper that gets near. Isshkazza also does not have much to trade he pats the pouch that holds his meger amount of credits, the supplies he has he needs Isshkazza continues on finding his fellow companions to sit with.

Finally, along with another group of residents, Vannara makes her way into the canteen to observe the trading. The turquoise-skinned twi'lek wanders casually browsing over this, that or the other. She does manage to stop and as her eye catches some piece of art. But even Vannara is well aware of the impracticality of such a frivolous exchange at this point. With a humble thank you, the twi'lek moves on.
Indigo eyes search through the growing crowd for familiar faces. Those of the group she arrived with, and perhaps looking for a certain twi'lek as well. Even Vannara can be a curious cat at times, after all. It isn't long before the young woman slides up next to Isshkazza settling into a chair next to the wookie after he finds a place to sit. "Whispers say that the initial talks were somewhat exciting," she notes, keeping her voice a bit low. "I've heard a few things while the rest of you were making certain talks went smoothly. We should converse, all of us."

Ben wonders around the area. Looking at all the wares that are out. He is not looking for anything. He says quitely to himself. "This is just like any other open air market I have been to." Thinking back to wht it was like to just travel the galaxy outside of this station, the smeel of the fields of Coreillia and taste of warm spice cake that his mother made. Simple thing that he will miss now that he is stuck here. "Well better make the best of it."
He rembers that one of the council members had a map and he needed a datapad to get it. So he starts to look for a datapad, nothing fanacy just something that would work.

Yvanus browses the available selection, intent on finding a good combat knife, if one is to be found. He bounces the few credits he has left on the palm of a hand, wondering whether or not the denizens of the Cage still had any use for them, but determined on trying to trade for them in any case. While the proximity of the Imperial faction causes him no small amount of disquiet, he manges to hide it well under the veneer of a daydreaming shopper.
...A daydreaming shopper with a sniper rifle and half of the imperial crest tattooed across his face.
While moseying about the makeshift merchant bazaar, the Mandalorian makes sure to keep his eyes peeled for anything quirky enough to catch his amusement. A space station with so *eclectic* an arrangement is bound to have wares of an uncommon variety.

Tanis spends his time perusing the wares of both communities. Though unlike some others his attention appears to be focused upon items that others might well consider foolish to have considering the circumstances. Jewelry, trinkets, musical recordings, surely of no practical use. Yet he pleases members of both societies by spending a few standard credits for just such minor items at their greatly reduced cost.

## Re: Secrets of the Ghost Star 003 - Additional Complications

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-18 16:29:33)

Yvanus finds no one willing to sell a vibrodagger for the credits he can offer - weaponry is at a premium here on the station. The best deal he finds is an archaic dagger from some backwards world, functional enough but less damaging. The lowest the vendor is willing to accept for it is two hundred credits.
Tanis spends forty credits on seemingly worthless treasures - a hardcoded holo showing clips from a concert performed on Coruscant six years ago, and an erratic piece of art formed from wildly-shaped synth rope.
Ben, meanwhile, finds no one willing to part with a datapad.
Finally, the trading draws to a close, and the terms of whatever arrangements the Grand Admiral and the Gilded Cage council have come to are settled. The remaining wares are packed away and removed from the canteen, and under Eelya's direction citizens of Cage begin setting up the hall for the trial of En and Anon. A table is set up at the far end of the hall for the council, Arklyte, and the Grand Admiral's aide. Several other tables are set up in a square formation, leaving the end nearest the door open. Members of both communities are invited to sit as jury. At Eelya's insistence, the two groups are split up and arranged randomly, and it is quite a bizarre sight to see stormtroopers - minus their helmets - sitting alongside Sullustans, Rodians, and other non-humans. Also invited to sit on the jury are the remaining guests - that is, Vannara, Isskazza, Ben, Yvanus, Tanis, and Saden.
It's around about this time that you first begin to realise Saden is missing, and has been for some time. Only shortly afterwards, the group sent to bring En and Anon from their rooms reappears.
Without En and Anon.
'They're... they're gone!'
And that's when things start getting hectic.

A young human in his mid twenties wearing a faded black and blue freighter crewman's uniform waits for Eelya or any of the other council members present to respond after he deliverd the disheartening news. It was one of those tense moments that Maros didn't want to be involved, especially with the Imperial conclave, he carries no love for them and he shows it whenever they are present. He wanted to distance himself far from their grasp, but over the years he has learned to accept that they depend on each other to survive on this metallic tomb.
Maros waits patiently for a response, but has a growing concern growing in the pit of his stomach.

"A very dangerous scholar indeed... "
Yvanus shifts his posture in his seat, deigning not to sit on the jury, but watching the spectacle all the same. He eyes the other members of his coterie, gaging their reaction as well as the reactions of those on the judging council. A slow smirk creeps across his lips as he awaits the inevitable imperial response.

Tanis is not about to directly mention their own missing group member. Though a frown crosses his features as the news of En and Anon's clear flight. "And not likely to return soon one can reason." His voice is low, perhaps not even loud enough to be heard depending on how vocal the reactions of others are. Yet it does present considerably different doors, now doesn't it?

Vannara quietly sits where she is, watching others reactions, listening to their words, before leaning forward faintly. Indigo eyes seek out Eeyla, and the turquoise-skinned Twi'lek tilts her head to the side. "What is known of Scholar's Seat?" she asks curiously. "That is where the two claim they are from, after all. If they can be contacted, it will help clarify their characters. Otherwise, I fear there is going to be trouble."

Not sure what will happen with this turn of events Isshkazza prepares for the worst and puts a hand on his bowcaster. HE does not draw it only gets ready for a fire fight. Looking around the room Isshkazza takes note of all his companions positions and the troopers positions as well. Isshkazza takes watch to see if anyone pulls out a weapon and with a sigh he waits though he is sure he will not have to wait long.

Resting his hand next to his blaster starts to move closer to his freinds. Think to himself."Ok, This could get ugly really fast. These two seemed to be a soruce of tention between the council and the Imperails." "This could spril out of controll and I hope we are not the ones that have to high tail it out of here."

'As I recall the story only Anon is from Scholar's Seat; En met her there. I have no idea where he's from originally.' Eelya replies to Vannara. She appears drained, as well she might - Grand Admiral Arklyte is simply livid.
'What is the *meaning* of this, Eelya?' He shouts, storming across the canteen towards her. Grorrl, Ssurk, and Kar close in, ready to come to the defense of their community's spokeswoman.
Eelya's lekku writhe, frantically responding to Vannara's unspoken message as the Imperial advances toward her.
>
'You helped them escape, Eelya?' Arklyte asks, enraged.
'I assure you, Grand Admiral, that is not the case.' She replies wearily. 'I have no idea how it was accomplished, but it was achieved without the aid of Gilded Cage.'
'It is your responsibility regardless. What do you plan to do about this?'
'Naturally I will send out a team to retrieve them immediately.'
'Unacceptable, we cannot trust your people to do the job. If the possibility they aided in the escape exists, they cannot be considered trustworthy.'
'And your men will no doubt shoot on sight and ensure their demise before their chance at a trial.'
'A trial! You still want to give them a trial? They had that option and look what they did!'
The debate seems like it will rage for some time - Vannara is observant enough a courtier to know Eelya is buying her time to discuss the request with her comrades before it is broached in the conversation with Arklyte.

Maros drops his head slieghtly sighing at the Imperial diplomacy. He would like to say something about Imperial justice, but he holds his tongue in an effort to expiate there presence. He raises his head back to its original position after losing his poise for a second, and regains his facade of diplomacy. He rather be reading the history about some ancient fallen society then listening to Imperials barking about justice.
Maros knew his place, he had learned that lesson early when he first arrived on "Ghost Star" years ago, so he stood there quietly waiting for Eelya's reply to his message.

Ben hopes that it doesn't come to that, but with the Admiral as mad as he is this should be should be interesting. "If you think we can help out in this then go ahead and suggest it Tanis."

Looking around the room it is obvious that it would not take much to spark the tension into an all out battle. Whats worse many on both sides would be killed or injured, everyone is mixed together so chances are high that the numbers of fatalities would be high. Isshkazza know he is no speaker, he is a soldier. With pleading eyes Isshkazza looks to Vannara

"Very well," murmurs Vannara softly to those she arrived with. "I will volunteer us." The turquoise colored Twi'lek looks around, considering for a moment before she suddenly glides forward, head bowed and hands clasp in front of her. She move as gracefully as a Twi'lek can manage but stops when she is assured she has enough attention.
"Do forgive me for speaking up," offers Vannara in fine and eloquent tones, "However, it appears to us," she says, a hand motioning to the men behind her, her companions, "That we, having just arrived, are a neutral party, with no obligations, really, to any one group or cause." Okay, that might just be a bit of an embelishment, but Vannara does not stop to allow that to sink in. "We are traders, who have been captured by this massive vessel, however, we have amoung us some warriors. We are willing to leave, immediately, after the fugitives Anon and En, to retrieve them, if that is the desire of the Council of Guilded Cage, and Grand Admiral Aklyte who speaks for the Imperial Sector."
A brief pause, as Vannara takes in a slow breath, her indigo eyes observing the Grand Admiral and Eeyla before she continues. "From what we have observed and what little we know of this station, it is, indeed, vast and dangerous. There is no need, if we volunteer, for either Gilded Cage or the Imperial Sector to loose good men and women which are better suited in protecting their respective enclaves. It was dangerous enough for those of the Empire to come to Gilded Cage for trading, let alone sending troops chasing two fugitives." Vannara bows herself a little deeper, though her back is perfectly straight, and while it looks like a position of contrition, of submission, the way that Vannara handles herself suggests it is also a position of confidence and strength in it's own right.
"Please, allow us to prove our worth to both communities. Allow us to be the ones chosen to retrieve the fugitives."

'Very well.' Arklyte begrudgingly allows when Vannara has pleaded her case. 'That seems like the best compromise we're going to manage.'
'I agree, well said Grand Admiral.' Eelya adds, for all the world as though the idea had had nothing to do with her - which, in the minds of those who cannot understand lekku, it didn't. 'However, the newcomers have no knowledge of the hazards and security protocols around here. We will have to send a representative.'
She points at the man at the door who brought the news of En and Anon's escape.
'Maros, perhaps. I was going to assign him to them as a guide anyway.'
'Then,' Arklyte adds levelly, 'I would be remiss if I didn't assign any of my own men to accompany them. You, and you.'
He points at two Stormtroopers standing nearby, and they march over.
'You are to give these men and women as much care and protection as you would one of your own squad.' He tells them.
The voice of one of the troopers crackles through the electronic vocalising of his helmet, sounding much like the voice of any other helmeted stormtrooper.
'Yes sir.'
'Good.' Arklyte says with a smile, turning back to Eelya. 'You find this acceptable?'
The twi'lek looks at the two stormtroopers, then Maros, then the "neutral party".
'Yes, it seems reasonable to me. Very well. Good luck, everyone.'

Maros formed a small smile at the mention of leaving Gilided Cage even if it was for a day or two escaping the mundane chores the council has assigned him, but his expression was quickly removed when the Grand Admiral ordered two stormtroopers to accompany him. Maros tried to hide his content for the Imperials presence, but it seeps through is face uncontrollably.
Maros dutifully replies to Lady Eelya and council members looking at each one as he responds.
'I will do as the council wishes'
Maros turns to greet the new arrivals and seems anxious to leave.
'I am Maros, I would like to make pleasantries and introductions more formal, but we have to move promptly if we are to make up time already lost. Get your gear together and follow me.'
Maros moves to lead the party out ignoring the stormtroopers.

Vannara waits until the rest of her group moves to the guide, instead she stands between Eeyla and Grand Admiral Arklyte. "You are most gracious to loan us two of your precious Stormtroopers," notes Vannara working hard to make it sound actually sincere. Then she bows her head to Eeyla, "And your generosity of a guide is noted, Councilwoman," she says before straightening.
"We will follow En and Anon and do what we can to retrieve them. We are willing to put ourselves at risk, but we will not walk into certain death. That would be foolishness, and the energy wasted wondering upon when we will return or even IF we will return would be a useless endeavor," the Twi'lek woman notes.
Indigo eyes seek Eeyla's, and the woman's lekku twitch slightly, > Then she turns to look at Grand Admiral Arklyte without a word and turns her head. Vannara's eyes seek out Kar, her lekku twitching once more. >
Then, as regally and gracefully as she can manage, Vannara will glide after the others of her compatriots, including Maros and the two Stormtroopers, each of whom she greets with a nod. "You are Maros? Where do you hail from?" she asks curiously, before looking to the two figures in white uniforms. "What is it we are supposed to call you?" she asks. "I do not think Stormtrooper A and Stormtrooper B to be appropriate. What are your names, Troopers? We are to work together in this, let us make certain that we do."

Maros quickly relpies to the Wookiee
'That's good big guy because you have to be on your toes here on Ghost Star.'
Turing to Ben Vor'en nodding to his introduction
'I'm hoping to get off this metallic rock, so any chance I have to leave Gilded Cage means I might reach my goal. My guess to where they went is as good as yours.'
As Maros is leading the group out he turns to reply to the Twi'lek he replies when he is in safe earshot distance of the Admiral
'Originally I lived on Coruscant, but that seems so long ago. I spent a short time serving on a freighter, now Ghost Star has been my residence, although it feels like a prison. I was lucky that Gilded Cage found me first, it could be worse.'
Maros sneers at the stormtroopers
'I could be stuck at the Imperial conclave, or worse *dead*.'

Yvanus maintains his neutral expression, although he takes mental assessment of both stormtroopers, knowing what things to look for that the armor cannot hide. He weaves his way through the crowd until he's walking past Tanis, waiting until he's shoulder to shoulder with the man before speaking in a hush that only they can hear.
"The troopers are meant to watch us... and wait. They'll be in direct contact with Arklyte the whole time, through the helmet-links. Be on your guard, and spread the word to the others when you can."
The Mandalorian then moves on without awaiting Tanis's reply, surveying the audience and awaiting a moment to speak with Ssurk as inconspicuously as possible.

Tanis gains the smallest hint of a smirk as Yvanus makes his way past, but gives no other signs of communication. One way or another, this is certainly better than sitting around as 'guests' in the place. The smirk becomes a little more visual as the man gives a small nod in Maros. " A prison you say, believe it or not, that is a good sign. Because there's one constant about any prison. It always releases it's captives. One way or another." There is clearly humor in that line for Tanis himself, even if no one else finds it.

The two stormtroopers look at Arklyte, clearly for permission to identify themselves when Vannara requests it. He nods.
'TK-1213', the first says. He, unlike his comrade, has rank insignia on his armour. Apparently he's a sergeant.
'TK-1420', adds the second.
'I think the lady meant your real names', Arklyte comments impatiently, 'not your call-signs. Go ahead, you have my permission.'
'Yes sir.' The sergeant acknowledges. 'Kadim.'
'Drett.'
---
Ssurk is as far away from the current "scene" as possible, now that Eelya and Arklyte and the search group have become engrossed with their introductions and planning. If Yvanus wants a chance to speak to the Trandoshan, now is the best he'll get.
As the Mandalorian moves across the room he sees Kar breaking away from the the conversing council members and passes by him as the Twi'lek heads for the door. He looks troubled.

Vannara gives another dip of hear head in a nod to Arklyte, "My thanks to you, again, Grand Admiral," she notes, before looking over at the other two troopers. "Let me see, if I am correct, you are a sargeant TK-1213, Kadim. Then it would be proper protocol to speak to you formally. Informally, perhaps there will be opprotunity to speak to you as well, TK-1420, Deet. I am Vannara, I have no special titles attatched to my name. So it would be a great honor if you would simply call me Vannara."
"As for where the fugitives are headed, I believe the opposite direction of the Imperial Sector would be the most logical of choices to begin looking," says Vannara as she considers a moment, before bowing her head to the Grand Admiral once more. "If you will excuse me, I am going to see about procuring rations for all of us, now that we know our number." Turning away, Vannara then glides gracefully to a few people she had met earlier, and finally searches out the bartender for the cantina. "Hello again my new friend," note Vannara with a smile. Indigo eyes glance around and the Twi'lek lowers her voice, "We will need rations for this journey, and I was wondering if I could talk you out of your most intoxicating of drinks. A precautionary measure, I assure you," she says her eyes looking directly over towards the Imperial faction, before looking back to the Zabrak. "And a few other spirits, so that we might have something to barter with, of course," she notes with a bow of her head.
((Yeah, the guy has to make a living, but Vannara will first try to persuade him to give up the drinks for free, then if not, I'll dig around for SOMETHING of value on her to barter with!))

'Ah. Umm. Err' Vannara receives in reply as Oorok considers her strange and incredibly one-sided request.
The zabraki bartender scratches his chin as he thinks the proposal through, then shakes his head.
'Sorry, but I really don't see a way for me to recoup my losses on that: the sort of spirit you're after is valuable and pretty rare on this station. And I'm a little hazy on how you hope to benefit from it anyway...'
He trails off, inviting her to persuade him if she can.

Yvanus motions for Kar to follow him as he makes his way over to the Trandoshan, waiting for the Twi'lek to come over, should he so choose, before beginning.
"I suspect neither of you believes the helmets will be there to guard us..." He eyes both Ssurk's and Kar's reaction, letting his words sink in. The Mandalorian circumspectly checks to make sure there's no audience for their conversation.
"In the Corps, you fight for a strategic position, or an objective, but not a squadmate. Comrades are too easily lost, and where one falls, two come to replace him." Yvanus grins a crooked grin, folding his arms across his chest as he leans against a wall.
"Which leads me to believe that they're meant to watch us... and wait. For what, exactly, I am unsure. What I do know is that they will be able to maintain constant contact with Arklyte as soon as we leave, via comm system in the helmet." He taps his left temple, the one that is covered in tattoo, for emphasis.
"I suggest you all be on alert until our return-if we return. Any misstep here might be excuse enough for the *Admiral*," Yvanus says the word with a derisive snort, "to try and press an advantage over you."
"Then you might find your Cage with a new black-lacquer finish, yes?"

Kar refrains from joining them, apparently intent on whatever mission of his own he is on. He disappears through the double doors.
After Yvanus' explanation, Ssurk grunts.
'That explains the tattoo.' He says, then nods slowly. 'Yes, I would not trust the man as far as he could flee.'
He immediately explains himself for the Mandalorian's benefit.
'That is a Trandoshan saying. Prey does not flee far from the worthy hunter. Oh, it tries... I will put the community on full alert. We have ways of arranging that privately.'

Vannara gives Oorok her most pleasant and alluring of smiles. "Very well," she offers softly as she leans in, reaching out to run her fingers along the bar. "You want us to succeed," she notes. "If we fail, it is just the excuse Grand Admiral Arklyte will need to take the risk and invade Gilded Cage, annexing it, 'for it's own protection', of course," drawls the Twi'lek woman.
Indigo eyes glance around, and slowly Vannara runs a hand down her front, before pulling out what looks like, well, actually, it is, a stun grenade. Carefully she reaches out with her left hand, clasping at Oorok's to draw it closer for the exchange of valuable goods. "Now, from what I understand, one can never be too cautious with one's protection. As a favor, I'm going to loan this to you," she practically purrs to the Zabrak, then parts her lips in a faintly wicked smile. "And in return, you're going to loan me some of your stores, as well as perhaps a few rations for us. I'll use what I can to barter with on our journey, perhaps even getting you better stock once I return."
Then Vannara leans over the bar and says very very quietly, "And then you're going to give me the most intoxicating brew you have, so that if I need to, I can convince our dear escorts to drink with us, and since I can handle my drink better than most humans ...." The rest Vannara let's hang in the air as she leans back on her heels. Her eyes dart around as she slides onto a barstool. "Also, where do you think Kar is going? He almost looked worried. If I can catch him before we leave, I would consider it a personal favor."
((Persuasion, Deception, Force Point if needed. I don't exactly want anyone to know I'm walking around carrying grenades.))

'Put it away, put it away.' He says quietly, waving a hand dismissively. 'I don't want it, and you'll set off sparks if anyone sees it.'
'I'll put a package together,' he continues, hands moving across the remaining items on his table to begin the process, 'just bring back whatever you don't use and remember you owe me.'
'As for Kar, he's *always* worried. Gonna send himself to an early grave, the amount of thought he puts into everything.

That said, the young woman flashes a smile that almost seems happy, before she spins away from the bar. "Thank you, Isshkazza. I need to follow Kar. I need to speak to him. Keep an eye on our new friend, will you, for me?" she asks of the Wookie as she flits away.
With easy strides and graceful movements, Vannara does her best to head for the exit with what appears an unhurried pace. The smile that was on her features is gone by the time she reaches the door.

To be perfectly honest, Vannara iwas quite pleased with the fact that after asking for direction, she only got lost once. She had missed a turn, so it was easy enough to retrace her steps and figure where she erred. One quiet feet, lightly walking, Vannara makes her way down the hall to Kar's room. There is quite a high possibility that Kar isn't even here. Anon had been eyeing the Twi'lek, and perhaps he felt like he should chase after them and warn them.
That irritated Vannara as much as pretending to be helping the Grand Admiral. However, politics were tense in this place, more so than most places in the galaxy, and Vannara did not envy the path that Eeyla had to walk. A slippery slope, that one.
Reaching up, Vannara rests a hand upon the durasteel walls that form the hallway, hesitant, uncertain. Why Kar's leaving bothered her was still an unknown, she had not the time to fully sort the reason out as of yet, so acting rashly was unwise. But here she was. Reaching out, Vannara slid her fingers across the panel which would alert anyone, if there was anyone there, inside there was a visitor waiting for them to answer.

'Thank you Maros,' Eelya responds as the datapad is directed toward her. 'Perhaps you can show that to Oorok and let him organise it? I must keep our guest company, after all.'
The guest in question, the Grand Admiral, has moved over to the doorway, where he has been joined by the younger lieutenant who acts as his aide. Arklyte talks in low tones, and his inferior nods along with whatever is being said.
'Tell Oorok he may obtain what you need from the communal stores.' Eelya adds, looking intently at the two imperials. 'And your group should also find that girl Vannara, as we cannot afford to wait too long before you leave. I suspect she may have gone to see Kar.'
Eelya's expression becomes a smile so smoothly it's as if it was always there. She glides over to Arklyte, interrupting his conversation and engaging him in her own.
---
Momentarily, Kar's door opens. He himself stands in the doorway, and Vannara's keen eyes notice immediately that his great blastsword is not on his person, but rather on the bed she can see behind him. This is only the second time she has seen him without the weapon, and the last time she had been too busy to think about it, but seeing him without the blastsword is odd, somehow, it is so ingrained as part of his image. He seems naked - in a non-literal sense - without it, maybe even vulnerable. Or maybe that's just her imagination.
'Vannara.' Kar says, surprised. 'Why are you here?'

Why was she here? That was a very good question, and one she could not answer completely. Instead, Vanara bows her head for a brief moment before looking up at the warrior again. "I came to see you," she notes softly, her lekku twitching almost rhythmically. You left so suddenly, I ..." Vannara stops here, blinking as she looks at the Twi'lek warrior a moment, before reaching out, trying to take one of his hands into her own. "Eelya asked this of myself and my companions, and I agreed with her. I do not know the truth of En and Anon, what they have or have not done, but if we let the Imperials go after them alone... not to mention the Grand Admiral would blame Gilded Cage, and I could not allow that."
There is a pause, and Vannara looks down, before seeking out Kar's own gaze. "I will return," she promises, reaching up to brush the man's cheek with the tips of her fingers. "You have made me smile for the first time in a long time, Kar," she says softly, almost tentatively. "So, I will do this, to see that those you have vowed to protect will be safer. It will be my way of assisting you and making your burden lighter."

'I'm sure the Admiral would not do any favors for one as myself, being I am a member of Gilded Cage, but if you would like I would be happy to mediate. Your help would be appreciated, and your right two is tolerable, *I suppose*. We are going to need to find Vannara, her disappearance is straining diplomatic relations, as much as I like to the Admiral sweat we better find her.'
Knowing she is overwhelmed and its his job to guide the group Maros moves to Ben cutting him off before Lady Eelya is able to respond. He puts his arm around Ben and guides him away from of Lady Eelya and the Admiral leading him in the right direction to Kars residence.
'Hey Ben Vor'en don't bother Lady Eelya come with me I have a job for you. Do me a favor and find Vannara she went to see Kar and get her over here for departure. I like to see the Admiral sweat, but don't take too long I hate to see Lady Eelya have to deal with his whining.'
Finally he makes his way to Oorok and hands him the data pad of requests. One item was added to the bottom of the list : a pocket scrambler

'About time.' growls the Grand Admiral. When Eelya places a hand on his arm - intended to restrain him, comfort him, or perhaps both - he shoots her a look so intense it is hard to say the exact emotions that make it up. Anger is a big part of it, and loathing. It is to Eelya's credit that her own enforced smile barely flickers, though she does remove her hand. Wisely perhaps.
'Well then,' the Twi'lek says,turning her attention to the group assembled in front of her which is no doubt easier than facing the man standing to her right. 'You had better be off so that no more time is lost. Good luck everyone, and be safe.'

Vannara bows her head deeply, and then bows at the waist to the Admiral. "Forgive me, Admiral, but I do not make it a habit to carry all of my possestions on me, if I am given the chance. Therefore I needed to retrieve my personal items that will be of use from where they were stored. I am sorry that you find that disagreeable, but before your contengent arrived, I did not forsee the need to have all of my possessions with me. Obviously that was short-sighted on my part."
Straightening, Vannara gives a bow of her head to Eeyla, then turns and walks away. She smiles at Oorsk as she takes the cloth wrapped bundle very gently, offering the barkeep a smile. "I thank you for fulfilling this particular request," she notes, before beginning to take her own items for the journey.
((OOC: Persuasion attempt to calm down the Grand Admiral's anger. Like any of us KNEW those two would be trouble and run off so that we'd have to chase them down, be reasonable you Imperial B@$t@4d!))

*"Well I guess this thing finally started."* Ben thinks to himself as he follows the rest of the group. He waves at the bartender as he passes him. "Hope to be seeing you again my good sir."
Outside the safety of the Guilded Cage. He asks Vannara. "How long do you think Lady Eeyla is going to be able to keep the Admiral from eating the furnature." Ben smile as he trys to add humor to the question. "If he was that up tite about you disappering for a bit then if we don't find these guys fast he is liable to go off the deep end."
(OCC: Ben will take, 1 Water canteen, 5 days worth of rations, 1 breath Mask ,5 fliters and 5 Atsmophere cansters,2 power packs and 2 glowrods.

Yvanus grabs a medpac and slides it into one of the pouches of his field rucksack as he peruses the rest of the goods. When he comes to the rope supply, the mandalorian picks up the coil of Syntherope and hoists it over a shoulder with a nod to himself.
"If there's a centralized control center for the sector's systems, I suspect they will be going there. Otherwise, it may be best for us to figure how they escaped, and if anyone has seen them since."

"I am not knowledgeable in these matters," voices Vannara as she looks around to the others of the group. "But from what I have heard, the command center is in the Imperial Territory. So it would be logical to me, to think they moved away from that particular sector and away from here as well. And from my guess, I would say they simply slipped out the same door everyone else has been entering when none were paying attention." The twi'lek woman arches an eyebrow gently as she gives a quick glance to Yvanus, then bows her head a bit, looking over her belongings.

'Seems to be a fools errand, they could have went any direction.'
Maros looks to the Twi'lek
'I agree, they won't go anywhere near the Imperial Territories. That leaves three other directions they could have fled. If we had an idea of where they may visit we could try and beat them to the location and make the arrest. They will need to re-supply eventually.'
Maros moves to the bar to ask Ooruk a quick question
'Did En and Anon buy any supplies from you while they were here?'

'No.' Oorok responds to Maros' query. 'In fact, I doubt they had time to trade with anybody. They arrived shortly before the other party and were talking to the council until they retired to their rooms. Then in the morning they were almost immediately placed under house arrest.'
The Zabraki bartender leans over the table conspiratorially, to add quietly:
'If you can manage to do it without the noobs or imps finding out, you should make a stop at one of the scouting outposts and check around using the MSE-Sixes. Fastest way to find a trail, I bet.'

The tattoo across the Mandalorian's face stretches in a predatory grin.
"Often times, the best place to hide something is in plain sight. And if what they seek is within enemy territory, I doubt they would not justify a return." He shrugs with the statement, letting it hang in the air.
When Oorok lowers his voice, Yvanus leans in to listen. He nods silently to himself, filing the tip away for further consideration.
"How would we be able to get into contact with one of these outposts?"

Maros gives Oorok a small nod and quietly replies
'Good idea.'
Maros moves back to the group, he finally answers the Wookiee.
'Its possible that they were aided in there escape.' Maros thinks silently for a few seconds 'I don't know En or Anon nor do I know any of their aquaintances, and I'm sure any friend of theirs wouldn't reveal themselves given the circumstances. As far as the factions go, I'm only familiar with Gilded Cage and know of the Imperials, but maybe our two friends in white armor may know more.' Maros humors himself at the notion of them actually being co-operative.
Maros glances at the two knowing they heard him, then he turns to the group before they could reply showing his rudeness openly
'Did anyone talk to En or Anon?'

"As for Councilwoman Eelya, she is very adept and will keep the Grand Admiral calm longer than you likely expect," notes the twi'lek woman softly once outside of Gilded Cage. The woman's indigo eyes stray often to the Imperial troopers, before returning to her compatriots. "I do, wonder, however," she says in a tone that is not loud, but carries well enough in the cold halls, "What exactly the pair did to anger the Imperial Enclave so much. After all, if we know exactly what they've done, we can better prepare for their capture, their tricks, and their attempts of escape."

"Well i hope you are right about Lady Eelya abilitys to keep the admiral from tearing the whole place up." Ben really didn't have time to worry about what was happening at the Guilded Cage. he needed to keep his mind on what was happening now. "So any ideas where to start looking for these guys. I mean it isn't like we have the best layed plans here." Ben hopes the guide that was sent with them has a clue where to start cause he sure doesn't. He just hoped that nothing would jump out and try to kill him while they where trying to the two they where looking for.

The combined group leaves Gilded Cage through the reinforced doors where Fil once again stands guard. The bearded youth, so cheerful yesterday, looks grim as you march out beyond the protection of the community with two stormtroopers in tow.
As you walk, TK-1213, the trooper previously identified as sergeant Kadim, responds to Vannara's attempt to draw out information:
'They killed three troopers when they were stopped at our borders and asked to cooperate.' He explains.
'Without weapons,' adds trooper Drett, call-signed TK-1420. 'They're dangerous psychos that need to be disposed of!'
'That's enough of that, TK-1420.' Kadim cautions.

"I must agree with our friend, Kadim here, Drett," notes Vannara as she bows her head with a soft voice. "Dwelling on what has been done in the past, especially such a horrible event, only feeds the fear in our hearts and helps it grow. In the end it may well grow enough to paralyze you in a moment of need. So we will not speculate or dwell further on the matter. It is enough to know that they are dangerous with or without weapons."
Indigo eyes slide towards the Wookie and the twi'lek nods. "I certainly understand that sentiment, my friend," she says in response to his words, then says nothing further on the matter. Yet, at least.
For now, the twi'lek woman tries to walk with the Imperial Troopers, trying to build a report with them. "May I ask how long the pair of you have been on this ... Ghost Star?" she asks curiously. "Tell me of your homes. I was sold into slavery at an early age and have no real memories of my own. Asking of others is a way for me to hear of what a 'home' is, and thus is comforting in it's own way."

Maros was interested in what the two shell heads had to say on the subject of the crime, and for further clarification he addresses Drett aka TK -1420 in attempt to find out more.
'Your troopers were unarmed? That's unlikely.'

"Without any weapons?" Ben seems to be amazed at that fact. Taking down two fully trained and armed troopers with out the aid of a blaster that was something. "So if they can do that, then how are we going to chatch them and bring them in?"
Ben's hand moves down to his blaster just to make sure it was where he left it. He looks around to make sure nothing was going to pouch on him. "So where are we going to find these two anyway. They seem to know this place better then we do?"

'The stormtroopers were *not* unarmed,' Kadim corrects Maros, 'the two supposed scholars we seek were. I would not be surprised to find out they know TerÃ¤s KÃ¤si or Echani. It would certainly help explain their continued survival wandering the station.'
Drett meanwhile directs a response at Vannara. He certainly doesn't seem to display the loathing of non-humans the Empire is known for, but then the beautiful Twi'lek knows well enough that hypocrisies are often made with regard to those species more pleasing to the human eye.
'Going on two years. This thing is a weapon, did you know that? It tore the Grand Admiral's flagship apart. Some of us managed to evacuate in time, and that's how come we're here.'
Kadim turns to Ben.
'I was hoping our local guide would know the answer to that,' he says, acknowledging Maros with a nod, 'it's no secret that Gilded Cage has eyes everywhere in this part of the sector.'

A delicately painted brow arches upwards and Vannara frowns ever so faintly. "Troublesome, but then we knew these people to be dangerous before setting off after them. Again, I reassert my position that they likely traveled AWAY from the Imperial Sector. And then likely to the next largest sector in that line. And I know nothing about Gilded Cage, and it's supposed tendency to have spies. I have, after all, just arrived myself to this ... impressive weapon, or whatever it is," notes the twi'lek, keeping her lekku from twitching erratically.
"It does seem to me the most logical course for a pair of fugitives who will need supplies eventually, to go, no? A place where they can be just faces in a crowd when someone comes looking?"

"I agree with Vannara on this one. They would not head back to a place where they where likely to get caught, and they will need supplys after awhile." Ben looks at the Troopers. "Is there anyplace with walking distance that isn't where we came from or the Imperial area? That would probably be the best place to start." Ben starts to draw on his training from CorSec to help find them.

Maros takes point to guide the group, he glances at Kadim with a facade of trust, reserving his true feelings. If Maros did know anything he wasn't going to share it with the imperials.
'I have an idea where they may have gone, its away from the Imperial compound and down through the halls of decay. Its not a popular place for droids to travel considering the residue of a high corrosive substance that was a gift from a capture research facility ship. The area was contaminated with some sort of nano-technology that fed off metal compounds. It could have been the end of us all, but the damage was suddenly halted. Nobody knows why it stopped, but if it had not it could have consumed the entire metal station. The area has been quarantined for sometime the maintenance droids don't bother going there anymore because to many have gone missing, and they abandoned attempts to fully repair the area.'

A shift of indigo eyes falls upon the troopers, then Vannara lets out a long sigh. "Well, it does seem logical.

Or shall we sweep that area and have it be done with?" she asks.
