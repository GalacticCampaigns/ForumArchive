# Chapter 1 Breakout

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-07 21:44:05)

It is around 0 BBY, and you have all been in the Kessel Prisons for quite awhile, all your equipment has been taken*
It is cold, and dark as always, but today, you hear quite a bit more chatter from the other prisoners than usual, as you look out from your prison cell, you hear the blazing sound of alarms! You hear blaster-fire, and many explosions, and all of you find that your cell doors have been opened.
All of you look to see a man, worn, but who still carries himself with great confidence, and has an incredibly intimidating presence.
<!-- m -->[http://ts2.images.live.com/images/thumb &#8230; e3c66688f7](http://ts2.images.live.com/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=1640122744905&id=0bda469c81fcab3be820d7e3c66688f7 "http://ts2.images.live.com/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=1640122744905&id=0bda469c81fcab3be820d7e3c66688f7")<!-- m -->
Other prisoners all come towards you and hand you blaster pistols, and walk away.
The man announces to the whole group of prisoners (including all of you) "Any questions?"
**note that GM Visto will still have his lightsaber, as he is the only one who had stealth as a trained skill and mind trick, which would allow him to hide his lightsaber.*

OOC: ~ denotes thinking
Dr. Sarkin takes the gun more out of reflex than actual thought. ~I guess there goes my my chance for parole~, he thinks as he remembers the number of times the entire cell block was punished for the actions of one person.
OOC: Are any of the cell mates injured? Perception +10

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-07 22:25:20)

*ooc: No ones injured. yet.
hehe, I'm guess that means you don't recognize him. Good, good :*

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-07 22:28:11)

OOC: Is he going to try to sell me a Cordoba with rich corenthian leather seats?

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-07 23:59:32)

As the cell doors swing open Gav collects his possesions from the suspossed to be empty cell and joins the group of inmates. Gav not wanting anybody to think that he has a weapon accepts the weapon and pulls the power pack to check it. After finding it to his liking he snaps back in the blaster.
He looks upon the man sizing him up. "Whats the catch?"
((Perception +4 to sense decption if any))

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-08 00:11:31)

"Catch?" the man says smuggly. "There is no catch. We have all been imprisoned by the Empire, and now we are going to break out." he chuckles at your statement, and you can see the arrogance in his face, though you feel some of that arrogance has been justified from how hardened and experienced he appears to be.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-08 00:38:45)

Gav feels uneasy about the whole situation not wanting to harm the guards who are simply doing their job he decides to stick it out and see where this rabble of men are going. Glancing around the room Gav tries to make out faces that he knows while he has been hiding here as friends and foes. He pulls his hood up over his head and blends in.
((Stealh +8 to blend in , Perception +4 to look around))

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-08 00:48:48)

*ooc: The guards in the area were already killed. You see they have white armor of stormtroopers.
The rest of the guards haven't arrived yet, but you feel they will, and are simply preparing to take on the large mass of prisoners.
note, I'm also waiting for the others to post
jeez, rolled a 20 on the stealth check, so 28.*
You see that the man leading the prisoners could be a very powerful enemy, though it's unlikely he has friends, at least in the sense of affection, though he obviously has people who fear him. You also see 5 other people who look like potential allies (obviously the group)

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-08 00:53:43)

Gav being a smart person knows that armor of any kind is something you want to have. He heads over to one of the fallen troopers and takes his armor stuffing it in a bag that he collected along the way.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-08 03:21:29)

Surprised, but knowing that his only hope for survival may lie in this riot, Ulmo accepts a blaster pistol, sets it to stun, and addresses the five former prisoners nearest to him.
"Let's find our own way out of here," he says, eyeing the arrogant man, doubtful that he can be trusted.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-08 08:30:45)

Quin, hear explosions ripping through the building, and deaths through the force, when his cell door rips open. ~That makes my job easier~ he thinks. He sees a blaster thrown at him and moans. " I always knew I should have learned to fire one of these."
Quin turns to the man with shocking white hair and says " Do you know where the equipment room is, many of my things, as well as other peoples, are probably in there?" "Also, do you know where any starships that are nearby that we can "borrow"? Quin, says this in the kindest voice he can, and also makes note of a few other people who look like the could be of a great help to him.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-08 16:15:32)

The man turns to you and says. "Up ahead, past those doors. Once everything is ready, we will attack. And I have a transport nearby, I must simply get to it"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 05:33:40)

Grimm finishes removing the armor from the fallen trooper and gathers it up into the bag he collected. Hearing someone say something about an armory Grimm knows he must do his best to blend in not wanting to reveal his pressence as a jedi to anyone. He moves quietly among the group making way to the hanger to see what ships are are present.
((Needs to know if I was able to actually take the clone armor so I can add it to my equipment listing. Stealh +8 to be unseen while headed to the hanger bay away from the soon to be battle.))

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-09 08:39:24)

OOC: I am assuming the prisoners each have a blanket or sheet on their beds.
The doctor goes into his cell and takes a blanket. He does this in two other cells. He comes back out and tosses one of the blankets to the guy who is peeling off the armor, "you might find it easier to carry the armor using this."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 12:35:06)

None of the prisoners notice grimm as he removes the armor, as their attention is sorely on the man with white hair

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 15:25:16)

As you approach Gav aka Grimm you notice he is well in shape with facial hair simliar to Obi-wans in Epsiode III. He keep his hood dran far over his head as not to show his eyes and you can barly see his nose. He holds a pressence about him as someone who knows what he is doing and can hold his own in a fight. For some reason you just can't place a man like him being locked up.
Grimm looks at the man offering him a blanket then looks back at the make shift bag he is holding. He thinks to himself a moment and wonders why he didn't grab the blnket at first.
"Thank you...Sorry I didn't catch your name or for that matter seen you around the block but I have this bag already stuffed and it will be more of a pain to repack this nice suit of armor. Now if you will excuse me (Grimm says in a hused voice) I must see to a ship instead of the slaughter of men doing their jobs to control a prision riot." With a sharp nod he stealths into the background and heads towards the hanger bay. When using his powers he was able to get a layout of the prision to a certain level so he knows how to get to the hanger bay without confronting the reinforcements. Just in case trouble comes he has the blaster at hand...ready to stunn anyone who gets between him and the ships.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 16:55:48)

*ooc: the prisoners gave everyone NORMAL blaster pistols, not hold-out ones, so you have a blaster with a stun setting
urgh, I wish takahara and xandiel would post, then I would start this already*
You see only two paths are still usable, though the mass of prisoners block the way through either. You see all the prisoners are anxious, waiting for the fight.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 19:38:04)

OOC: Apologies hadn't realized we started...DOH!
In the crowd you notice leaning against the wall closest to the path on the right, a man early 20's with Green eyes, Short Dark Hair and Goatee, with his arms crossed, with a Blaster in his right hand, watching the crowd and watches the rest of you.
Perception +12 to notice anything in useful or out of place
OOC:Not Sure how rolls work but I assume go with my base Perception
Edit OOC: Funny I just finished playing Forces of Corruption, but I wouldn't know him anyways

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 19:50:37)

You notice a computer terminal that hasn't been destroyed in the beginning stages of the breakout. It's about 2 meters from Grimm and Tarnik

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-09 19:57:16)

The Doctor sets his gun on stun, ~I've never taken a life and I'm not about to start now.~ He looks at the man with the white hair, "we all want to get out of here, especially since some of us are innocent (he looks around)...well at least I'm innocent. What makes you so special?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 20:00:13)

I approach the Terminal and ask aloud, "Special or Not if anyone has any Skill with Computers I'd suggest you come take a look at this Terminal" and looks to see if any volunteers approach

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 20:01:04)

The man scowls at Dr. Tarnik "I am ALWAYS in control, and that's how I like it. I will get my revenge on the empire, and the hutts, and the Zann Consortium will rise again!"
The prisoners cheer at the last statement
the prisoners, enthralled by the mans speech, don't hear you.

Xan Grumbles "Figures, want something done, got to do it yourself" Uses Terminal to see what he can find out ~I hope this isn't too hard~

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 20:20:28)

rolled a 20. wow.
Anyways, you find out that there is a side route that leads past the armory, and storage. As well, you find the route leading from the armory to the landing zone (as there isn't hangar kind of thing, just an empty space where ships land)

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-09 20:22:15)

OOC: I don't have any knowledge skills in that direction, but I do have Connections: Have I heard of the Zann Consortium?
The Doctor walks over to the computer, "I know a little something on how to use this.
(Use Computers: +10) The name is Dr. Tornik Sarkin. Hopefully we don't get killed trying to get out of here. I see you don't need any help with this."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 20:28:36)

(I'll be nice, and rewind time for you.)
You have never heard of the zann consortium, and are confused by his words

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 20:35:19)

"The Name is Xandiel Young, but you can call me Xan" as he greets Dr. Sarkin and whispers "I think I found us a better way out of here, I'm not looking to get killed but I sure don't like where this situation is heading., What do you think?"
After his Questions Decide to use Knowledge Check on Galactic Lore +7 in Reference to the Zann Consortium

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 20:37:55)

You think to yourself if you've heard of the Zann Consortium, but come up blank.

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-09 21:21:32)

> &quot;I think I found us a better way out of here, I&#39;m not looking to get killed but I sure don&#39;t like where this situation is heading., What do you think?

The Doctor nods knowingly at Xan, "The best defense is not needing one. The guy with the white hair seems to be running the show, at least he thinks he is. You could try telling him, but I don't think he will listen. I am fairly certain he will not listen to me."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 21:35:06)

Xan Nods ~Well Guess things couldn't get much worse~, Xan looking at Dr. Sarkin "Well let's see if I can catch his attention.." Xan Shouts at the White Haired Man "Hey! You in Charge, since your playing leader you might want to take a look at this here on the Terminal, unless you'd rather go play Nerf Herder with your new friends!"

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-09 21:40:02)

"You may have just pulled the ears off a Gundark", as the Doctor grimices, just waiting to see what the white-haired egomaniac is going to do.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 22:52:39)

The man turns, and smiles evily, and laughs.
Then right in front of Xandiel a person appears right out of thin air
<!-- m -->[http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/starw &#8230; aiFen1.jpg](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/thumb/f/f7/UraiFen1.jpg/250px-UraiFen1.jpg "http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/thumb/f/f7/UraiFen1.jpg/250px-UraiFen1.jpg")<!-- m -->
"what did you say about tyber zann?" he snarls at you. You see the two gleaming blades he's holding, and you know he could cut you in half easily.
The man speaks up after this "now, now urai, no need to kill this lad. Not unless he gets in our way. You won't do that will you?"
*ooc: don't do anything stupid*

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:01:39)

OOC: Not sure if I should make a Will save not to wet myself lol
Xan somewhat surprised he didn't notice the Blade Wielding man, collects himself and whether out of Bravery or Madness states "Well I had to get his attention somehow, but as I've gotten yours as well maybe you'd pay attention to what I found out on this terminal, besides Knowledge is Power and killing me would deny you my knowledge now wouldn't it?" ~Well I was wrong it's gonna get worst~
Also a Knowledge Galatic Lore +7 to know the Species in Front of Me

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:06:08)

You think he's a talortai, a species that doesn't age, and is connected to the force.
"What information could you possibly give me that I don't already know?" he furiously states, "I have snuck past all the guards from the landing zone, what possibly do you know about this prison that i don't?"
Tyber Zann, still chuckling, says, "hmm, maybe we'll send him to the armory, draw off some troops for us."

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-09 23:09:37)

Knowledge Life Science +10 to determine the species.
The Doctor is speechless, but takes alook at the odd blades the creature has Perception +10. I am curious to see if the is any blood on them.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:11:20)

you are at a loss for what his species is, though you can see he has avian and reptilian characteristics.
You don't see blood, but they look incredibly sharp, sharper than should be possible for such blades

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:13:02)

Xan tilts his head towards the Terminal " I found out that there is a side route that leads past the armory, and storage, so why not take the path of least resistance to get out of here?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:16:47)

Tyber replies to your statement "You unfortunately do not have a full understanding for my plan. Urai, let's go"
Urai disappears right in front of your eyes, and so does tyber, and you can't tell where they are headed. The mass of prisoners surge forward, into the halls, and you start to hear blaster fire.
*ooc: I'm horribly impatient, though I'll delay until takahara arrives*

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:23:27)

ooc: Understandable not sure how to continue, Big Bird gave me quite a fright lol
~I am in way over my head, time to get out of here~ Xan looks at Dr. Sarkin and says "Let's take the side route and let them decide who the baddest Rancors on the block", then heads towards the Side Route towards the Storage.
Makes a Perception +12 check to make sure its safe down the Path as well

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:27:23)

You don't see anyone, but you hear footsteps getting louder from way down the hall.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:31:01)

~Great, what else could go wrong?~
Xan looks to see if there is any cover or a door to duck behind to see who's coming
ooc: Probably best to stop here since everyone else is offline huh?

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:33:30)

you see some crates, and dive behind them
*ooc: yeah, that's about as far as we will go today*

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-09 23:57:29)

Grimm not wanting to pose a threat to any guards pust his gun away and stadns defiant with he newly collected armor tucked away in the bag. Not know what to make of the white haired man or the twin bladed creature he simply didn't bother to comment still attempting to not draw unwanted attention his direction. He heads over to the terminal to see what route the Dr was talking about beign a side route and heads off in that direction.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-10 00:08:42)

you all see 8 figures wearing stormtrooper armor. One of them appears to be the commanding officer and spreads his troops out around him. Another carries medical equipment.
Dr. Tarnik 22
Quin 22
Grimm 21
Ulmo 18
Stormtrooper officer 18
Shiba-ken 17
stormtroopers 13
Xandiel 12
stormtrooper medic 5
(note, xandiel all your dex based skills are actually 10, but you only got a 2 on initiative roll, just so you know)

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-10 02:04:47)

~oh bantha podoo, they are going to kill us or worse, put us back in our cells. I'm not digging more spice~, the Doctor thinks as he shoots at the leader. Anyone who looks at him can clearly see he has no confidence with the blaster. As a swift action, he will use Battle Analysis. Unless otherwise stated these will be his default actions.
Attack: +5 3D6+2 Damage - set to stun
Knowledge Tactics +10
If you are familiar with the film Jay and Silient Bob Strike Back: picture the doctor firing his pistol in a mannor similar to Marshall Willanholly.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-10 02:08:07)

very good, rolled a 19 on the attack, your attack connects, but it doesn't affect him much

Quin looks at the commanding officer and gathers force in his hand and thrusts out with it trying to throw the commander of the stormtroopers into the one with medical equipment. He unleashes a huge swell and waits to see if it works. ( Move Object Commander to Medical Trooper, UTF Modifer +14

After still trying to shake off the thought of his fathers death, shiba-ken unleashes a round from his blaster

Yes, GM Visto, you have to fight too. They are indeed in the secondary path
and takahara, attacking is a standard action, but whatever. And I'm going to wait until it's your turn for your attack takahara, though it's ok if you post out of order
Quin moves the officer right into the medic, 24 utf check, and the officer falls prone, and both take 17 damage

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-10 22:33:56)

OOC: Quin has been with the group, and has been fairly silent on the way and watches all that goes on around him, waiting for any surprises. Also, next round Quin will use Move Object again with a +14 modifier to throw the commander into another stormy. Also, is the Medical Officer dead or just wounded?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-10 22:37:21)

medics still alive, yes.
and please tell me which one, from #1-6. That way I can actually keep track. Just assume they're all within range of move object and the officer. 1 would be the far left, 6 far right.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-10 22:44:09)

OOC: Quin will Move Object the Commander into the #3 position, because he knows that the troops follow him, and if he falls they may be easier to defeat.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-11 03:01:30)

Ulmo hefts his blaster and follows the party into the corridor. When confronted by the stormtrooper squad, he takes aim at the stormtrooper that Quin has most recently thrown the officer into.
[Standard Action: Ranged blaster pistol +7 (3d6+2)]

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-11 16:58:40)

Grimm shows no emotion as these people show their cability of using the force. For he knew he was the only one left after the jedi purge. He draws the blaster and returns fire but only shooting those who shot at him first.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-11 21:59:37)

Grimm shoots at stormtrooper #2 and hits him, doing 13 points of damage.
Ulmo takes a shot at the medic, and knocks him out with a well placed shot
The officer, uses born leader, and opens up with autofire on Quin. Quin barely evades the fire, and takes 9 points of damage.
takahara opens fire on the officer, but the bolt flies cleanly over his head.
The first stormtrooper, on the far left, opens fire on takahara, but his bolt misses by a wide margin.
The second stormtrooper, returns fire at Grimm, and catches him in the shoulder, dealing 17 points of damage, and moving him -1 down the ct. (note, if you want, you can attempt negate energy, though you don't have to. Of course, that is probably a stupid question)
#3 fires at Quin, hitting him in the leg as he dodges, the officers autofire, and takes 16 points of damage, and moves -1 step down the ct.
#4 Fires at Tarnik, but the bolt hits the crate he's behind (note, only xandiel and tarnik have cover, the rest of you might want some)
#5 and #6 fire at Xandiel, but the bolts don't come close to hitting him.
Xandiel fires, but his attack does not hit his target

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-12 00:26:15)

ok, grimm, you're not going to use negate energy?
anyways, quin negates the damage, but he still has 38 hp (your hp should be 47 at max, not 52.)
also, it's tarnik and quins turn, so post whenever your ready

---

### **schubudha** (2008-08-12 01:17:58)

~Oh frelling smeg, they are really trying to kill us~, the Doctor thinks desparately trying not to panic.
He glances around to see if anyone needs aid. He expected to see at least one of his "comrads on the floor. He was almost certain at least one of the troopers' blaster bolts found their mark.
"Frelling troopers",...~I'm going to hate myself for this~, as the Doctor switches from stun to lethal (spend a move action as a swift action).
Since no one seems to need aid, he takes a shot at the officer who he shot last round.
Attack +5 Damage 3D6+2
He will spend a swift action Battle Analysis

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-12 01:34:41)

you fire off a shot, and manage to catch the trooper in the arm, he takes 18 points of damage, and moves -1 step down the ct.
you also see grimm is at half health, and stormtrooper #2 and #4 are below half health.

> ((Posted on page four about using two of my actions to move up on the track when I used second wind.))

true, but that would've been going twice so unless you spend a destiny point, I simply condensed your actions (giving you second wind, 1 recover, and moving to cover)
Quin picks up the commander, and throws him into stormtrooper #3, dealing 15 points of damage to each. You also dive behind crates on the right of the corridor.
Ulmo's shot connects right into the stormtroopers chest, dealing him 15 points of damage, and killing him.
The officer makes an autofire attack against takahara, but takahara barely evades, taking 9 points of damage.

After taking that glancing hit, Shiba-ken (takahara) realizes his fit of rage has put himself out in the open. He moves to a spot with cover and returns fire at the ooficer.

OOC: Should have internet at my apartment again by Friday...Pole apparently ripped the the Cables under the Ground :x
Xans confidence raises as he realizes he has allies, and for one round makes a Galactic Lore Check +9 to see if he knows why the Officer is flying around the room (and if I make the check and know what it is, suggest it be used to take away the guns if possible)
After the battle is over Xan will make a perception + 14 to search the Storm Trooper Officer and Medic for anything of use and take what he can and something to carry it all in, and if any of the Storm Trooper armor is any good put on one of the suits (Not the Helmet though, so not Xan's Style)

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-13 13:23:17)

Takahara's bolt once again cleanly sails over his head (he's prone, so he gets +5 ref against ranged attacks), takahara also moves behind crates in front and to the left of him.
Xandiel, battles not over :
You do not know why the Officer is flying around the room, and are in awe about it.
I will assume you attack, considering that you will not have taken an action otherwise.
Stormtrooper #1 aims and takes a shot at Quin, but his poorly placed bolt misses
Stormtrooper #3 aims and fires at Tarnik, and is hit in the shoulder, taking 15 points of damage.
Stormtrooper #4 aims at Takahara, and his bolt knocks a crate into takahara, taking 16 points of damage, and moving -1 step down the ct.
Stormtrooper #5 coordinates with #6, who fires at Quin, but misses.
Xandiel aims at stormtrooper 3, but his bolt misses by a wide margin, hitting a computer console on the wall behind him and frying it.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-13 13:28:34)

Quin grins as the blaster bolts fly around him, easily evading them. He doesn't know how to use a blaster but he will try. He picks up the blaster that was tossed at him and fires at stormy#3. (Ranged Attack, +2, Blaster Pistol)
OOC: I've included the -5 for his attack, since he is not proficient with the blaster

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-13 13:31:11)

You are too lucky. Critical hit.....what the? Perfect damage too? :

oops, stormtrooper 3 is dead. but since he missed, it's ok.
Anyways
Quin's shot goes wide, while Tarnik's shot is a direct hit, and the officer takes 10 damage, but is still alive and awake.
Tarnik sees the officer, himself, and takahara are at half health or below.

Shouting Grimm says, "Take the officer alive we may need information and a hostage!" grinning Grimm levels his heavy blaster upon the officer and squeezes the trigger.
switching his gun to stunn (swift action) and shots at the officer (standard) 2d8+3 Stun Point blank, all the while making sure to keep cover (move action).

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-16 03:35:31)

Grimm's shot goes over the officers head (he still is prone, so his defense is incredibly difficult for any of you to hit, just warning you.)
also, you don't need to use a move action to maintain cover.
Ulmo's shot just grazes the stormtrooper, dealing 11 damage to him.
the officer, aims at grimm, but his shot is poorly aimed, and misses.
Shiba-ken, fires at stormtrooper #1, and manages to get a good hit on the stormtrooper, dealing 16 points of damage to him. You can see him grunt in pain from the attack, though he isn't dead or unconcious.
Stormtrooper #5 fires at grimm, hearing his shout, but it misses
Stormtrooper #6 fires at shiba-ken, but it barely misses, and the stormtrooper also drops prone (gaining +5 ref from ranged attacks)
Xandiel fires at stormtrooper #1, and manages to hit him, dealing 10 damage, and knocking the man out cold.
ROUND 5

The crates contain everything from food, to tools, and other assorted supplies.
#2, #3, #4, are all dead.
Tarnik see's that #5 is below half-health, as well as the officer.
Tarnik and Quin's shots go wide, leaving black marks on the floor near him
Grimm's shot once again misses.
(my suggestion is to get up close and attack with melee against the officer and #6)

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-16 13:17:36)

Out of the shadows, you see a figure dart out from behind the stormtroopers, this figures has some sort of weapon in his hand, and hits the officer with it, and the officer goes out cold.
The stormtroopers momentarily turn their attention towards him

Doctor Sarkin speaks, "Damn I was hoping the medic was going to have more medpacs. It looks like this Bomarr cast-off has made smeg of these packs."
"Perhaps a quick round of introductions is in order. My name Dr. Tornik Sarkin. If anyone is wounded I will see see to your wounds.
As to the Zann Consortium, I can only guess that they are some rival gang of the Hutts."
He turns to the Mon Calamarian, "I think we have the Zann gang to thank for this glimmer of hope for making our escape, but other than that I think our aligence is to getting the frack out of here."
The Doctor picks up a rifle (blaster carbine?) and kicks the body of the lifeless medic stormtrooper, "Damn you..Damn you to hell."

I think Shiba-ken is the worst wounded and will be the first to be treated, followed by Grim. Unless I have missed something or one of the other players says something.
IC: The doctor heads to Shiba-ken, "these imperial medpacks don't seem to have a pain inhibitor. This is going to hurt like a Son-of-a-Sith-harlot. It will help to keep your wounds from getting infected"

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-17 02:06:16)

Grimm is in shock to hear someone else be called a jedi. To further his shock to see him use his powers out in the open with so many bounty hunters on their tails. Stepping up to the door he puts his hand on upon the door trying to feel its thickness. He shrugs off the use of the medpac explaining, "No save if for another time I will heal and my wounds are not as bad it seems. Now step back away from the door." Drawing his lightsaber the orange blade springs to life as when it was used during the cloens wars and defending himself against the bounty huters. After cutting the door free he turns without another word and collects his belongings and heads out to the hanger bay. Turning to speak over his shoulder, "You are not the last jedi but if you continue to use your powers so they will come for you as they did many of my friends." Grimm heads to the hanger bay after that.

You all get your equipment back, including credits. Rekara grabs her vibroblade, datapad, and her grenade launcher
"Another jedi? wow, two in one day."
picking up her grenade launcher she says "Ah, just how I remember, good, they didn't ruin my fine weapon."
As you all walk down the hall, Rekara stops in front of you "What was that? I think there's something up ahead."
In the low-light, you struggle to see what she's looking at.

Grimm continues down the hallway to the hanger bay not waiting for the others to catch up. Asking himself how much danger is he in now that others know of his existance, are any bounty hunters on way, is this Lord Vader going to come here as he came so many times my fellow jeids used their powers. I must get away from this prision it is no longer safe for me to hide in. Grimms concern is not for the others but only himself and yet Grimm feels as thou in the past he would be willing to help those in need.

"you, slow down!" rekara yells at grimm "mines!
Rekara fires a grenade in front of you, and mines explode meters away from grimm.
"ugh, so that's what they were doing. ok, we need to proceed carefully, mines could be hidden all throughout the hall"
you all look at the hall, littered with various crates, beams, even bodies, and struggle to see the mines, with so little light.
"come on, let's slow down, as I'm going to need help to see where the rest of the mines are placed." rekara moves next to grimm, her large eyes scanning the area in front."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-17 03:53:07)

A flash of anger shoots over Grimms face as a grenade flies over his shoulder and then blows a mine up practically in his face. Shielding his eyes from the debry that follows Grimm turns to see who shot...more or less at him.
"I don't mean to be rude to someone who in their own way just saved me by exploding two dangerous objects in front of my face but speed is of the essence and to slow down will only allow those who are in pursuit to catch up with us. I understand your caution to move forward..." Searching out with the force to detect these mines Grimm continues to walk forward with caution.
((Use the force +14 for the check, Perception +4 to notice the mines))

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-17 04:21:12)

Will use move light object to move the mines I could sense and throw them down the hall way to trip off the others.
"This is not safe the structure won't be able to take many explosions." Grimm doubts his ability to perform with the force due to being scared of being hunted once again. He continues down the hall with caution.
((Side note he clipped his lightsaber on his belt but pulled his cloak to were it couldnt be seen.))

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-17 04:25:04)

you struggle at first, but the mine moves up into the air and is thrown into a few crates, and explodes, triggering the explosion of other mines, you all have to close your eyes at the intensity of the blasts.
Rekara smiles at your move "Very nice jedi, but there are still some up ahead."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-17 04:30:36)

"It's Grimm not jedi." Grimm rinses and repeats with sensing for the mines and only moving those that need to be moved.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-17 04:38:28)

you have trouble finding the mines, and fail to sense there presence.
Rekara holds up her grenade launcher "let me take care of this, grimm was it?"
she fires a grenade into the area in front. instead of an explosion, you see an electrostatic pulse, and the mines light up, and go dead.
"I think that should be it." Not much farther I think.
You all move up ahead, and move into a circular room. as you start to head for the door, you see the door close behind you.
out of the shadows, you see 3 large figures up ahead.

At the armory Ulmo retrieved the blue-bladed lightsaber his master had given him at the start of his apprenticeship and clipped it to his own belt. Through the minefield he assisted the others by spotting the mines, until they came across the three large figures. He drew his lightsaber out still unsure if he would use it.

autofire will only hit one, they are somewhat spread out.

Ulmo draws and ignites his lightsaber, holding it at a defensive ready stance [Swift Action: Lightsaber Defense], and cautiously approaches the the nearest droid [Move Action, 2 Moves if necessary, to stand at least two squares away from any droid, but two squares away from the closest droid; activates Fighting Defensively].

Grimm waste no time in taking advantage of the droids size. Picking up one of the driods in the back he launches it into the other one that is behind the lead. Spending a force point to deal more damage to both. He then moves to join...jedi between these droids and the others. Grimms lightsaber ignites to life as he joins the others. He takes a battle stance ready to pounce at a moments notice.

Grimm picks up droid #3, and throws it into #2, dealing 27 damage to each, and you can see both droids weaken a little bit.
Quin moves towards droid #1, (your attack is actually +9, with battlestrike), and strikes the droid, dealing 27 damage, and you see sparks leap from the droid.
Rekara, fires a grenade at the stormtroopers, dealing 8 points of stun damage to each, and you see both stormtroopers stagger.
Xandiel fires at droid #1, but the shot bounces off the droids shield.
Droid #1 charges at grimm, and hits, dealing 20 damage to him, and sending him -1 step down the ct.

nope, didn't skip you, just people posting out of order (which I'm totally fine with, in fact relish)
shiba-kens shot barely misses hitting the droid (in fact, I'll allow you to spend a force point to allow it to hit)
grimm's attack (while you didn't actually say that, eh), hits and deals 14 damage to the droid.
quin rolls a 20 on his move object (since the online dice rollers, down, I've been using real dice, and you guys have been doing much much better.)
you move the droid into the other at a very high speed, and both droids explode in a flash.

you find only one has good armor left, and that few of their weapons still work. the vibro swords the droids use would be useful, but they can't be removed within the time you have. (about 1 minute) not to mention you have no tools at all. You do however, find that a light-repeating blaster that works.

Well education or not I've never heard of a doctor or anyone for that matter who wasn't a member of the jedi order having knowledge of the word sith :04 .

Do we actually have any concrete evidence that most knew that Vader was a Sith? I didn't think that was common knowledge, as details about the Sith were purged along with information on the Jedi Order, in order to keep Palpatine's identity secret.
And yes, "sith" was a common curse word in Basic all over the Galaxy.

Not really. Tarnik does have Knowledge tactics.
Think of the expression "Beaten like a red-headed step child". We all know what it means; however, the origin of this phrase eludes most, if not all of us.

OOC: I am going out. I will not be back for hours.
IC: The Doctor give a quick thanks to Grim for the hand up. He hits the ramp switch to close the hatch. He heads up to the cockpit and will take whatever seat is available. He activates the shields first and then begins with the engines. As soon as they are airborne he will either start the hyperspace calculations, or assist with it.
If possible, he will make a note of the last origin point the craft flew from before he starts the calculation. If this is going to slow down the hyperspace calculations by more than a round or two, he will skip it.
If the Doctor has to, he will do everything. He will gladly take the second bananna if someone else wants to take the helm.
The Doctor is pretty frantic about getting off that rock, so dpend force points where needed

He wrapped the pilot seat's crash webbing around himself, took quick stock of the situation, and lifted the ship up with its repulsorlift drive.

As you move closer rekara opens fire, hitting the tie and dealing 38 damage to it. Ulmo then opens fire, and destroys the tie.
the other tie moves behind you and hits you with it's laser cannons, dealing 8 damage and reducing the shields by 5
Xandiel then restores the shields back up to normal.
as he does so, 3 more ties show up.
Rekara shoots at the tie that just hit you, and gets a critical hit, destroying the tie.

The ties than close in on you again, and fire their laser cannons, and hit the ship, dealing 4 points of damage, and reducing the shields rating by 5.

"well, I'd prefer that you all stayed, but you can go if you must"
Turning to the remaining two "either of you gonna leave? well either way, I to show someone these codes just in case."
she takes out her datapad, a holoprojector and comlink and link it to the ship, typing in codes
a hologram of another mon calamarian shows up. "rekara hello, at first, I thought you were an imperial spy who tortured the codes out of you. Glad to see you made it out alive. What are you doing on an imperial ship? that things going to show up like a beacon to any thorough investigators. You should get another transponder signal to cover it up."
rekara smiles, or as close to it as a mon calamarian can "glad to see you still talk to much anson. And now for my report. Zann's made it out of prison, and that means he's probably moved his headquarters again."
Anson comtemplates this "ah, so he did make it out. I heard solo did that. anyways, I believe if you can get into contact with the bothan spynet, you can find him, they can find anyone, as long as they get paid. Hmm, but to find them, you'll need to go through a contact on onderon."
Rekara's eyes flicker as this is said "onderon? we're heading there now. what a strange coincedence."
Anson chuckles at this "indeed, indeed a strange coincedence. but maybe a lucky one. the contact's name is krevan, and he's staying at the mechanics shop in onderons capital, the mechanic there should be friendly also, he's a sympethizer. By the way, who are those people with you? Not often to see a togruta around, especially in these times"
Rekara turns to quin and ulmo, and you sense she is wondering if it's ok to reveal you are jedi "hmm, these are other prisoners I met on Kessel, they were instrumental in my escape."
"Ah, I see. Well, if there's nothing else, I'll be shutting this transmission down, but I'll transmit some new codes for you, yours are quite outdated"

When the transmission had ended and the holoprojector shut off, Ulmo bowed his exotic head at Rekara. "I appreciate your not revealing my . . . nature to your friend at this time," he said. "Our escape from the prison world required some . . . flamboyant displays of power, but unless we want to have bounty hunters, customs agents *and* the Inquisitorius breathing down our neck every step of the way, we will need to exercise more discretion in the future."
He slid smoothly into an acceleration couch and sighed a long, relaxing sigh. "That being said, it is good to be out. Thank you, Rekara, for including us in this escape. Doubtless we couldn't have done it without you. I, for one, will gladly go with you to Onderon to aid the Alliance. I was attempting to make contact with a Rebel cell in a neighbouring sector when I was apprehended by the Imperials, so though the detour was unpleasant, the outcome seems to be looking up."

I know we aren't going to be able to land on Dxun, in fact, if we tried, all that'll be left of us and half the forest is a scorch mark. The imperial fleet there will force us to land in Iziz. We'll need to be careful while we're there. There is an imperial garrison, and there's also onderon's military. And of course, there is a small criminal underworld that operates in Iziz, but the empire doesn't do much about it, as long as they don't attack any imperials. We'll be watched in a lot of places, so we need to be careful about what we say"

As the doctor starts walking through the ship, he smells something familiar. It was a faint smell of bactine, ~oh great, one of the medpacs must have spilled open~. After spending a few moments checking his supplies, he realizes that his supplies are fine and that the odor is coming from one of the rooms.
"By the stars, it is medical room. I did not think there would be one on a ship this size.", he says, not really sure who he was talking to.

Ulmo now regretted not spending more time going over the ship's logs and familiarizing himself with its history, crew, etc.
"We have a few minutes before we'll be queried," he said to anyone listening. "Perhaps we could check the on-board flight logs and see who we're dealing with here. We'll have a better chance coming up with a deception if our story matches any Imperial attempts to query our logs directly."

you find some wires that look like they would project you having damage, though on physical inspection it wouldn't hold up.

Ulmo listens silently as Xan asks Grimm his questions, strapping a belt and holster around his waist and tucking his lightsaber into a deep pocket where it couldn't be seen. He waited to hear what kind of response Xan would get to his inquiry, but offered none himself as he slipped the blaster pistol he had been handed back on Kessel into the holster.
*In spite of everything,* he thought,*It's still better to be wary.*
He left the hold and headed for the airlock. "Alright," he said loudly enough for the others to hear him. "If anyone asks, I am a minor administrator at the prison. If they ask about the TIEs our laser canons destroyed, we tell them that we were temporarily incapacitated by our hijackers," he indicated the dead stormtroopers whose armor had been removed [right?], "And they destroyed the TIEs on their escape before we could regain control of the ship.

As Xandiel ask his question about what Grimm knows of the jedi a flash of pain shoots across his face and you can see his facial feature (chin in a sense due to his hood still being drawn) tighten as he clears his now hoarse throat.
â€œA dark time headed our way when the Jedi chose to lead the clone army into battle. Many jedi choose to leave the order believing that it was not their place to fight wars. Not their place outside of peace keepers to tag themselves as commanders and generalsâ€ Grimm all but whispers. â€œA time came for when the war was to be ended with the defeat of the separatists leaders Count Dooku and the droid General Grevious. Both fell to the blade of master a jedi master by the name Obi-wan. My master was asked to join high council member jedi master Mace Windu to accompany him to the Supreme Chancellors office to ask him to return the power that was granted to him back to the republicâ€¦As to what happened during that talk I donâ€™t know, as to why jedi are now hunted for sport and credits I all I know is that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared that the jedi attempted to over throw him and take the power for their own. Taking on the title of Emperor never to return the power granted to him, he declared the jedi traitors to the republic. After that all people able to use what we call the force were hunted down and either slain by a man who goes by the name Darth Vader or bounty hunters after sport and credits.â€ Grimm ends as if he was talking to a ghost in the ship and for the first time you feel emotion coming from Grimm. â€œI hope you found what you sought in my tale Xanâ€¦That it may uncover truth about what happened to many jedi I called friends, brothers , sisters and masters.â€ Having his hands folded down ward with his robe covering his hands he walks towards the ships landing pad lightsaber at hand. Looking as thou a great load had been shifted from his shoulders but still carrying the burden of his past. He exits shortly behind Ulmo.

Ulmo's senses perk up immediately at the mention of a holocron. [Pyramid holocrons are traditionally Sith, are they not? Or is that a poor assumption here? And would my character know the difference?]
Others had been known to forge holocrons and dupe gullible buyers, so he was cautious, but the opportunity of a holocron in his possession was difficult to pass up. It could be his responsibility to bring the teachings of the Jedi to others around the galaxy . . .
*Mind the present,* he chided himself. *The future belongs in the future. To bring the future into the present is to bring distraction and folly.* His master's words cleared his head and he leaned close to Xan.
"Be carefuly," he whispered. "Holocrons are dangerous in these times, and many are fakes anyway. Simply showing an interest could be enough to draw unwanted Imperial attention."
He stood up straight and addressed the Quarren vendor. "How can we know that this artifact is genuine? And how did you find it?"

"Ok Doc, but I think unfortunately we will have to stick with the "Group" something tells me this is no where near over for us, and the "Hand Wavers" may be our only Hope to survive it" Xan sips his drink "As for the "Droid" I'm sure our Female Friend will be taking care of that" Xan looks around "I'm more worried at the fact we have split up so we need to look out for ourselves, as well as for the others"

You may be right about the group sticking together, although you should be careful around the "hand-wavers". History tells us that they like to play both sides against the middle.
We should finish our drinks, and see if we can round up the group.

Grimm: "Quin if I may ask you something? Why is it you do not fear the people who hunt jedi? I ask for you seem able to use the force quite often and I hate to but somehow it has seemed nessacary as of late." Grimm looks around once again as Quin and he walk towards the ship. "It's not in any way that I doubt your ability to use the force or a lightsaber but I doubt we can trust anyone who isn't jedi(Hand waver <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> ) at this point. It's why I don't support or for that matter of fact care about this so called rebellian and that they wish to over through Palpatine. I myself and going to find out what happened when Master Windu and the other jedi went to talk with Palpatine and why he now calls himself emperor and labelled jedi as traitors." Grimm lets the words sit in the air a moment turning to Quin, "I know not of what is to come from this journey or what this mon cal and her group is up to but I for one don't trust them or any who willing follow her into this war." Lowering his head, "I for one had my fill of war during the clone wars and wish to never see it again up close." Grimm is silent for most of the way back to the shuttle.

Quin ponders Grimm's word, and says." It's not that I fear the people hunt, the jedi, its just that I am ready to meet them to find out more what happened to our esteemed order, and also to find Emily, the love of me life who was taken by them."" I also, agree with you and think we should be wary of non-jedi force users.""I'm only,because I was captured trying to find information about Emily.""Perhaps if I had been a little bit stronger or a little bit faster, she would be here now."

Ulmo and takahara enter in the shop behind rekara.
The owner, a old man with large goggles is holding a sonic welder and is welding something together.
he looks up from his work and asks "hello, what can I do for you?"
Rekara moves closer (you both follow) and whispers to him "The fusion cutters look well kept."
The man's eyes shine for a moment, and he speaks quietly to her "hello, I was expecting you, come into the back"
he brings you all to the back of the workshop.
"it's safe here, I have anti-surveilience measures set up. So you're the agent I was told to expect? what is it you need?"
Rekara replies turtly "We need two things, to add transponders to our ship, and to get in contact with the hawk"
"I see. Well, by tomorrow I can add to your transponders, but I might be more difficult to meet with the hawk. He almost got caught, and he's been hiding in the western portion of the city"
"So what's the difficulty? we can just go there"
"the western city is infested with crime, gangs, ecetera. The empire's too lazy to get rid of them, they even pay them for information or to fight. Sometimes the gangs enter this area of the city, the east side, but that's rarer."
"Where is the imperial headquarters?"
"It's at the palace. Not a place I would go."

as you move into the landing bay (the door was open), you see the mesh tape was disturbed, but not broken.
At the edge of the bay you see a cloaked figure, who jumps out the opening.

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-03 01:05:33)

**Acrobatics**
Long Falls: When falling a great distances, you can attempt to use your acrobatics skill to guide your descent. Make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to land on a target near a square you would normally land in. You can adjust your target by 1 square for every 60 meters fallen. Gamemasters can give favorable or unfavorable circumstances-for example the amount of wind or the favorable use of equipment, such as baggy clothing.
So based on this the check and then throwing out the jedi robes and cloak to help reduce speed. If need be i'll make small jumps to get down there if that will help out.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-03 01:07:07)

but wouldn't you still take falling damage? you don't have surge, though you could reduce maybe a dice or two of damage with acrobatics alone, you wouldn't survive without surge.

Grimm feeling unnerved about finding nothing out of place with the ship is at a loss for words. Not knowing what else to do Grimm centers himself looking within to find the answers he seeks.

you also see spilled coolant lines. but the hyperdrive itself hasn't been touched.

He turns to Ghent, "Why were these guys after you?"
The doctor turns his gun on stun and fires a couple of more times at the nagai, ~He will live, but he is going to wake up with a wicked headache.~

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-09 00:43:42)

Ulmo's blood went chill. *Another* Force-sensitive being? Was it possible that the Emperor's Jedi hunters were already on their heels?
Ulmo had run across dark Jedi in the past and evaded them just barely. The presence of companions gave him some cause, but the Empire's resources were nearly limitless -- it was only a matter of time before word caught on that a cadre of Jedi was roaming about the galaxy, and then, who knew what the dark would throw at them.
"This is dire news," he said softly. "Perhaps it was a mistake coming here. Rekara, I think we should plan to meet your friend as soon as possible. If our unexpected visitor was from the Empire, then he could be warning his masters of our existence already. Secrecy is our best hope of avoiding extermination; it would be best if we carried on with greater subtlety and discretion." He looked pointedly at the other Jedi who had barely hesitated to flaunt their powers earlier.
"Let's get ready to go when Rekara has made the arrangements. And this time, try to keep your lightsabers hidden."

Looking towards Ulmo as ht tires to be discret about blame. "The fact of the matter is they know were here regardless of how hard we try to hide. All someone has to do is look in the in the ship and they would find all the answers they need...oh wait someone did look in the hsip and took out our engine to slow us down. Wonder if that person had a plan to dely us until he or she could get word to their superiors. I don't know about the rest of you but when a man is able to cast aside anything I use at him mock me and run away I give chase not go off lollly gagging in the city looking for parts and bringing back more trash then we need at the moment." Turning to Xan, "And if you call any of us that derogative term one more we'll have words you and I."
Grimm feeling frustrated at this mock of a party tosses the two datapads to the Doc. "Here you might be able to get something out of these as they seem to be locked down." With out waiting for anyone elses advice on any matter that is non of their concern Grimm leaves the ship.

quin lifts another weequay, and sends him flying into another one, killing both weequays.

Anger rises in Grimm as this so called jedi claims to be working one as a criminal and two payng off the empire so that they can continue to do so.
Grimm: "I'm sorry you must have me mistaken for someone who has fallen so low as to work as a criminal and even lower if you think I would work for anyone or anything that is paying the empire, the same empire that called the jedi traitors and flagged them to be killed on sight for a nice bounty." Grimm although angered is not showing any sign of it through his words or actions. "If I was a jedi and had this asked to me I would only feel sorrow and pity for anyone who would join to support the empire and the crooked man that now sits on his self proclaimed throne." Turning to leave Grimm still has a grip on his lightsaber, "In case you didn't catch it my answer is no, even thou I am lost for my place in this galaxy it would never be on any side that supports the empire."

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-24 00:55:20)

ooc: the problem is you are flat-footed, and so can't use block. If you're perception mod was higher you probably would've beat his stealth check, an 18, but with only a 4 for a mod you can up short by 7
so you still take the damage. sorry

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-24 00:56:38)

Using the force the whole way there knowing I was headed into a trap still left me flat footed?
Using it to detect the pressence of hidden people wouldnt allow him to maintain that unless I lost that roll as well.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-24 00:59:16)

you knew he would attack, but not which direction, which counts to me as flat-footed. In the case of fluff of course I'm not going to have you actually hit with the saber, unless it was a little burn or something, but in general, it's up to my creative licensing.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-24 01:04:06)

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-24 01:08:24)

in this case you knew he was in the area, though you did not know where he was, meaning you are flat-footed

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-24 01:23:18)

OOC: Could argue this all day but the call is wrong on the falt footed and using the force of using sense surrounding. Will waste negate energy absorb the damage and to neagate the attack.
Grimm was aware that this would take place from someone who fell so far. Grimms lightsaber burst to life as anticpating the attack all along through the guidence of the force. Allowing him not to be caught with his guard down has he had been using it all along since he knew he was walking into a trap as he sensed earlier when following the man.

essentially you're in a circular area (almost like an arena. hehe)
all stone. nothing to really pick up (by hand or by force, unless you can make the check to move a colossal object (essentially a building)
you can however pick the jedi up and throw him into the floor, walls etc. of course he can do the same. There is a path behind you, but you know that the enemy can easily follow you.

Grimm feels that fighting here is not going to end well for anyone but it is still safer then fighting in a public area. Making sure that this so called jedi knows what a true jedi is Grimm press the attack with his quick strikes all the while keeping his surroundings in mind.
Grimm attempting to talk the man out of this attack: "Is this what you have become? To once call yourself a jedi and now to fight in the name of a crime lord. You must find the strength in you to overcome what ever hold this crime lord has on you."

your swing collides with the mans block and you send him stumbling backwards with your strength, dealing 19 points of damage and moving him -1 step down the ct.
"You are an impressive warrior,"
The man raises his hand, and you feel a great pain from your chest and you take 10 points of damage

Gripping his chest for but a moment Grimm fights off the pain knwing that more has to be done before this fight is over. Grimm moves in for another attack making quick stabs to keep the man off guard.

your lightsaber glances off his, neither of you gaining an advantage.
The man's expression turns to something between pure malice and fear.

As you take a moment to regroup, the fear in you subsides (all is normal again).
As your two lightsabers clash and collide, suddenly the miraluka retreats a few steps, and you feel him gather force energy. He lets out an ear-bursting scream, and you take 11 points of damage, your damage threshold goes down by 5, and you move -1 step down the ct. Pain wells up inside you from the sudden power of his attack (persistent condition, can't be recovered except by surgery, or other method of going up the CT)

grimm ferociously pounds the mans defenses and you can see the weariness on his face, and he takes 20 points of damage and moves another step down the ct.
The man charges at you, and manages to kick you as you block his saber, and you take 10 points of damage.

Grimm feels uncertain about the event that just happened. it is not often two jedi fight one another and it is something that he isn't used to. Walking over to the unconsisous jedi Grimm takes precautions and move the blinded manss lightsaber to himself and puts it away. After checking the mans vitals and finding him to be alive but barly Grimm gathers him up and heads back to the ship. No matter what happend this was still a jedi and deserved to be helped no matter what path he took in life. Grimm attempts to be descrite as possible while moving to the ship acting as if he is helping a drunk friend home.
Prior to leaving the area Grimm searches through the force to sense if anyone else was there or was watching.

The doctor drags Grim's body on the medical bed. He examines the wounds to see if first aid or surgery is needed. He has both a medical kit, surgical kit, and a number of medpacs.
Before operating on Grim, the doctor takes a quick look at the other critter, after confirming that the other critter is not in critical condition, he begins to work on Grim.

Grimm although is exhausted lets the doctor treat his wounds without complaint. After the doc is done Grimm pulls his shirt and robe back on and helps the doc get the blinded jedi on the table. Staying out of the way Grimm is intent on the skill that Tarnik has. While lifting the fallen jedi onto the table Grimm searches him looking for anything that would give information or be a tracking device.
Grimm: "Thank you Tarnik this guy seems to be in worse shape than I."

As you give him first aid, which btw gives him 28 hp (rolled a 20) he wakes up in surprise. he attacks you both with a force slam, but his condition cause his attack to do little harm to either of you, dealing 10 damage to each of you.

~Is every damn person I meet one of those hand-waivers?!?~, Tarnik think to himself. Tarnik shakes of the effects of the attack and looks at Grimm, "You care to tell what that was all about?"
The doctor injects the attacker with a mild sedative (something that would keep a normal person down for a couple of hours).
Tarnik turns back to Grimm, "I have given him a mild sedative, but you hand..er..jedi types seem to have fast metabolisms. I don't know how long he will be out for, but I am sure it won't be long enough. We need to do something with him, but I will not let you kill him while he is under my care."

If I had any sense and my cred stick I would leave. Eventually he is going to wake and do what ever he did before. I don't want to be near him when he wakes.

Grimm chuckles at the doog doctor with his question.
Grimm: "Well he was spouting off about some crime lord that watned to hire my kind and I guess wouldnt take no for answer. So I figured he would be useful to the moncal as she is looking for information. And by all means keep his shebs sedated until you feel like waking him.

"Force-user?" Badon asked incredulously, his nostrils twitching. "That's a dangerous way to be in these times."

"There's nothing safe to be done with him besides killing him," Badon growled. His claws can be seen to extend and retract in a menacing sort of way.
"I don't know how you all do things here, so I'll leave the decision in other hands. But my advice is to be done with it. You have a doctor, you can make it painless. The fewer who can compromise us the better. We have important things to do."

Xan jumps up and runs over to grabs Quins Arm "I was joking earlier but now I mean it, thugs and Imperials are deserving of being shot in the back..." Xan pulls Quin away from the man(Miraluka) , putting Quin against the hull of the ship(Grapple Check? or Cut Scene?) "....but killing defenseless people is cold blooded and I'm not going to let that happen Quinn!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-10 22:44:01)

He is hardly an innocent man, and he is a threat. Killing the Miraluka is a way of making sure that he won't hurt us, and if he had died in battle it would not matter. At this point you only care about the circumstances of his death not how he died. If I killed him while fighting would you care. This is my view of the force, there is no good, there is no evil there is just the force, and you do not have the right to dictate to me how to use a power you yourself can barely comprehend. Quin will get out of the grapple if that is what it is and then slay this man.

ah, I apologize for that, but suffice it to say from where you and grimm are standing/sitting (no clue) you can see the medical suite and quin creeping towards it, until xandiel pins him.
Quin grips xandiel with the force, crushing him with brutal power, dealing 22 damage and moving xandiel -1 step down the ct
Rekara looks shocked at this, draws her blaster, sets it to stun and fires at quin, getting a critical hit (whoa, did not expect that, I'm serious too), dealing 12 points of stun damage, and moving quin -2 steps down the ct.

So you are all against me fine, I will not kill this man, injuring enough is plenty for me now, I won't kill or hurt him now if it will only end in my demise. Quin will stop fighting go into a different room, use as many swift actions to get rid of his conditions that it requires, and will then enter a force trance.

oops xandiel forgot, stun damage is the same dice as your normal now, so your stun is 3d6+2
quin's at -2
(quin does gain a dsp, because he did attempt to kill the miraluka, and almost did.

Badon had readied his stun baton to react to any further aggression from Quin. Now he put it away when the other stood down. He shook his maned head and walked out of the med bay. He stopped at the doorway and looked over his shoulder at Tarnik and Rekara. "You can never preserve all life," he growled. "Conflict necessitates that some lives be prioritized over others. By sparing this one, you have endangered us all."
With that he went into the hold to gather his thoughts.

OOC: OK, I thought Xan had done something to drop Quinn down the chart.
What is the Miraluka doing?
The doctor grimaces, "Is there something in the air? It is bad enough that everyone in this blasted system wants us dead, but now we are fight amongst ourselves. Thanks to the actions of Quinn, I have no idea how long this bugger will stay unconscious." Tarnik goes into his pack and pulls out a roll of meshtape. He puts a piece over the miraluka's mouth, "A little bit of mesh tape could fix the universe, perhaps that stop his speak attack or whatever hand-waving thing he is doing.
He adresses the group, "I have had my ass kicked more in the last two days than I did in the last two years. As much as I detest the idea of working for anything criminal, we need to align with some faction. We need to find some place safe. It is only a matter of time before the Empire comes looking for this bucket of bolts, not to mention the way our luck has running, I am sure that Lord Ego will take a swipe at us.
At the rate we are going, we all be dead within a week.
Rekara, while I am no fan of your terrorist...err alledged terrorist organization, I would like to know what they got cooking.
Do we know if this miraluka was sent by the same crime lord on the hologram?
At this stage, I do not know how much choice we have. Keep in mind if we go visit this great "Oz", we need to be prepared to work form him. His kind generally do not take no for an answer.
After we answer this question, we need to discuss Quinn and his actions.
OK, I am tired of listening to myself speak, what do the rest of you think?"

The doctor nods in agreement, "I agree my life would be less difficult if the miraluka was not on board, but my oath and honor as a doctor demand that I try to save the savable and ease the pain of those who are beyond my abilities. So far, I have not killed anyone, but I have been instrumental in the death of some while defending myself. The taking of life should never be an easy thing."

Grimm is astoneshied at the hate and drive to kill coming from Quinn. Grimm knowing that something must have happened reaches into the force to see if Quinn has taken steps to darkside. (Use the Force +14)
As to the whole fight sorry that I missed the chance beat up on people <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> . Since Grimm never left the side of the dark jedi he will attend his wounds and wait for everyones temper to cool down. Grimm waits for the fallen jedi to wake and triesto talk with him calmly and see if there is anyway that he will talk without the use of his powers. (Use the force to talk to him via telepath)
Side note: Grimm is now on guard for anyone who comes near the blind jedi after hearing the conversation on the ship. Anyone comes near him Grimm will not hesitate to defend to the death. (Note that Grimm knows who was protecting and who was attacking so this doesnt mean I attack Tarnik if he tries to heal and such)

Grimm doesn't see Xandiel as a treat and doesn't act beyond the general conversation. A hint of anger creeps into Grimms face as Xandiel starts to say hand waver but when the young man catches himself Grimm lets it go.
Grimm: "I know nothing of how to teach one to tap into such power Xandiel. For as you know I am only a padawan when order sixty-six was ordered. I can teach you up to what I know if you wish to learn how to defend yourself but at this moment that is all I am able to accomplish in my current state."

To Rekara's first question about Quin: "You know him better than I do. We watch and we prepare to contain a threat. If he acts out like that when we're out in the open . . ." he paused intentionally. "That cannot be allowed or it will put all of us in danger."
In response to Rekara's more recent question: "We find this . . . Istan-whatever-his-name-is, and get what we need." He double-checked the power pack in his blaster, snapping it in for effect, and then slipped it back into its holster. "What are we waiting for?"

the bith's eyes flair for just a moment, but then soon return to normal.
A twi-lek pips in "Vruvian? who are they talking about?"
the bith angrily shouts "I don't know, but we've got intruders!" he draws a blaster, along with the people he was talking to (there was 4 of them btw)
a few thugs also draw melee weapons.

### **schubudha** (2008-10-23 22:48:41)

Under Tarnik's breathe, he says to the group, "I think the hand-waver set us up."

Teak sat in a small, cramped room, staring at a tiny holo-display. It was sliced into the camera feed of Shisa's warehouse.
He watched the newcomers with a careful eye, wondering what they were up to. They couldn't really be as clueless as they looked at the moment. There had to be something else going on.

----------------------------------------
Teak, is very suprised to see a fight break out inside the hideout!
----------------------------------------
Ulmo draws a pistol and shoots a thug before he can close in. the thug drops.
Tarnik as well draws his weapon and moves behind a desk
Xandiel backs up (since he can't get to cover) and fires a shoot at another thug, dropping him.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-10 15:53:26)

A swift strike against the throat caused the sentry to fall down into a motionless heap of meat. Silent as the night, Someth quickly slipped by and entered to corridor the man had been guarding. He didnÂ´t really care if the man was dead or alive, it would be some time before he got to his senses anyway. And by then the Noghri planned to be far away.
Entering ShisaÂ´s base had been easy enough, but finding the information he was looking for proved harder than expected. There had to be some sort of treasury where the crime lord kept his most precious things. He was certain that heÂ´d find what he was looking for there.
Stealthily, the small figure moved along the walls inside the complex, skulking through the shadows, and becoming invisible.
((Stealth +14))

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 15:56:33)

Someth moves unseen in the base. You suddenly here the sound of blaster-fire, meaning someone's started a fight!

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 18:10:22)

Teak kept his eyes on the holo-feed. However this fight turned out, it would be interesting to watch.
A flash of movement caught Teaks' eyes on another camera feed, but it was only a small scurrier. Nothing to worry about, unless you counted the infestation as a problem.
(Perception +2, and I'll take 20, since I'm not doing much else.)

You catch a glimpse of something odd at the back end of the room, but it disappears

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-10 18:22:55)

*Blasterfire…?*
Someth paused for a moment, motionless against the wall. He was certain he had not been found, so that would have to mean that there was something else going on here. While the distraction would prove useful and could certainly ease his work, he didnÂ´t like the idea of leaving people with ready blasters behind him.
Moving in the sound of the blasterfire, he crept closer, sprinting from cover to cover, all senses on alert.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-10 18:26:03)

Teak's eyes flickered to the back of the room, but whatever he'd seen there was already gone.
Something about this still felt out of place to him, like there was something else going on. He turned his eyes back to the blasterfight and continued to watch, enjoying himself more than he'd ever admit.

someth, behind a crate watches a cathar, a mon calamarian, and a few humans fighting shisa's gang.
suddenly, a crate flies out toward you and hits you full on, deadling 20 damage and moving you -1 step down the CT. You see an insectoid standing over you, with suspicion on his face.
teak watches the crate hit someth, and sees the Vruvian standing over him

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-11 01:17:05)

Steady behind cover, Someth watches how a small group appears to be fighting ShisaÂ´s gang, and he also notices the prescense of the crime lord himself. This could be a chance for him to reach Shisa, and make him disclose what information he needs.
Suddenly, everything explodes in a cascade of pain as something heavy hits him and nearly knocks him over. Diving into a roll, he spots what appears to be an insectoid creature. DoesnÂ´t matter what it is though, it is not going to be around for very long. Recovering from the initial shock, he launches himself at his attacker, fist and feet working in rapid sequance to strike at the opponent.

you hit him with a good kick, but your leg actually bounces off something you can't see. His eyes narrow at you, as if he is laughing (he's an insect, so his emotions can't be expressed like a human would)
he then attempts to cut you with a vibroblade, and he narrowly misses

Teak saw the Vruvian standing over the small but horrific-looking . . . *thing* and shot to his feet. His head smacked into the ceiling of his tiny room, and pain shot down his lekku.
Teak grimaced slightly, but didn't let the dull throbbing bother him. He grabbed the tool kit off his belt and left his tiny room, hurrying across the street to the warehouse.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-11 12:55:07)

Someth mounted a heavy kick against the side of his opponent, but he found his foot bouncing of some kind of unseen barrier. Beginning to realize just what he was up against, he steeled himself for a challenge.
As he flexed his body to avoid a cut from his opponents vibroblade, he leapt into the air, bringin his body into a spinning motion that brough his feet up against the cheek of his opponent.

The barest hint of a grimace crossed Teak's face, but it was gone almost as soon as it appeared. The bug wasn't going to make this easy, was he? He needed another tactic.
He walked out from behind the console, out in plain sight. With a carefree grin on his face, he began walking toward the Vruvian, keeping both his pistols trained on him.
He shrugged. "You know, if you had just given me my money we wouldn't be in this situation. Come to think of it, now that I've gone through all this trouble, I think you'll owe me an additional five thousand. No, make that ten thousand."

As the insectiod sprinted away at incredile speed, a new flash of anger ran through Someth.
*Will he never run out of tricks?*
Taking up the hunt, he slid his hands down to his belt, one of them producing a grenade and the other one a small, well-balanced knife. Heaving with all his might, he hurled the grenade after the fleeing opponent, and readided the knife for another throw.
((Move Action to move after the Vruvian, Swift Action to get the Grenade out, Standard Action to attack (+7 to hit, 4d6 Slashing Damage, Area Attack) and a free action to draw forth a knife))

If possible Tornic will take a stun shot at the Vruvian.
Note: He will not take the shot if the Vruvian is engaged in melee.

Someth throws a grenade at Istanvisto, injuring him for 17 points of damage.
Badon then charges Istanvisto, wounding him with his claws, doing 18 points of damage.
Teaks shot then hits Istanvisto, searing him and knocking him out.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-01 16:16:27)

Happy to see the insect go down, Someth turned around to locate Shisa. While he would have been more than happy to make sure the foe was fully taken care of, the crime lord was his main objective. With a swift hand movement, the knife he just drew vanishes back into its hiding place again, and the noghri quickly moves towards the downed Shisa, ignoring the other crowd of people around him.
*First things first…*
Keeping one of his kneecaps firmly on the chest of the downed Shisa, ready to crack the crimelords ribs if he donÂ´t comply, Someth shakes his target, willing him awake.

---

### **schubudha** (2008-12-01 22:53:42)

Tornik looks a bit miffed, "OK. Can someone now tell me what the hell is going on!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-02 14:38:29)

Teak remained standing in front of the door. Like Tornik, he wanted to know what was going on, and no one was going to leave until he found out.
He shifted his blasters to aim at the small man perched on Shisa's chest. "Don't kill him," Teak warned. "I want him alive."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-02 16:12:35)

Someth only cast a quick glance at the TwiÂ´lek now threathening him. Slapping Shisa once again over the face to bring him awake, he speaks with the hard, guttural voice so common among his people.
"So do I, but I only need him to be able to talk. So put the guns away, they wonÂ´t do you any good anyway"
Swiftly, the noghri runs his hands over Shisa, searching for weapons, datapads, code cylinders, anything of value that might help him to access ShisaÂ´s vaults or the databanks of his network.
((Ready an action to roll over using Shisa as a shield to cover myself, just in case : ))

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-02 19:08:51)

someth finds 1000 credits, a datapad, and a comlink
the bith wakes up from someths physical pressure and attempts to struggle, but you pin him down.
His wide eyes show fear as he knows he has no escape

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-02 19:09:10)

Teak smirked. "No. No, I think I'll keep them out."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-02 19:17:30)

Glad to see that Shisa had been unarmed, Someth quickly pockets the items he found, and as the lying crimelord wakes up and tries to struggle focres him down hard, he turns his dark eyes to the downed bith.
"You have information that I desire. DonÂ´t lie to me by saying you donÂ´t, because I know that you do, and you are going to give it to me"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-03 19:09:17)

Shisa quits his struggling, knowing it is hopeless "What would you know?" he asks, desperate to end this

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-04 06:04:09)

Sensing his foeÂ´s desperation, Someth gently pushes some more on a particularly painful - but nonlethal - spot.
"LetÂ´s start with you telling me about Honoghr, and whatever involvement you have had with that planet in the past"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-04 18:55:52)

"I didn't have anything to do with the diaster on Honoghr" the bith frantically pleaded, "it was the fault of those separatists, not me!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-04 21:59:44)

Intrigued, Teak kept listening. Honoghr . . . he'd never heard of it, though he presumed that was where the small man was from. Teak moved to a computer console and did a quick search on it.
*Use Computer +9. I'm not really expecting to find anything, but it keeps me busy.*

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-04 23:17:30)

Once again applying pressure to a very sensitive point, SomethÂ´s face hardened.
"What separatists? I know you have names Shisa, and I want you to give them to me"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-05 18:00:43)

Teak beings searching the computer for mentions of Honoghr
"A resercher named Silva, he designed it, they say he's with Zann now"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-05 22:08:57)

"Silva? tell me more about him. What was his involvement with Honoghr?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-06 12:07:41)

"He designed the poison Trihexalophine1138. now I've told you what you wanted, now let me go"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-06 13:02:02)

Driving his knee hard into ShisaÂ´s chest, Someth gets up.
"You really are in no position to tell me what to do Shisa. But since you proved cooperative, youÂ´ll live. Not sure about what these other guys will do though"
He casts a glance at the others around him.
"And tell your ugly friend that the next time his tricks wonÂ´t save him. Not from me"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-06 14:24:21)

Teak, though not finished with his computer search, turned to face Shisa. Finally, Shisa was gonna get what was coming to him.
He grabbed the Bith's arm and hauled him to his feet, and pressed a blaster into the man's lower back. "Remember me, Shisa? Remember what you did to me? No, don't answer, I know you know."
Teak paused for a second, reveling in the satisfaction of finally bringing this crime lord to justice. "You're coming with me, Shisa."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-08 13:51:14)

the biths eyes grow wide as he recognizes you, "Wait! Please don't! I'll give you anything you want just don't take me!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-08 20:52:38)

Teak grinned malevolently, more to scare Shisa than anything else. "I'm surprised you're this cowardly. Shisa, what I want is for you to come with me. That is what you are going to do, because I am the one with the blaster."
His blaster digging into Shisa's backside, Teak pushed him toward the door.

---

### **schubudha** (2008-12-11 22:36:40)

Tornik decides to take advantage of the situation, he turns to Shisa, "why did Istanvisto (sp) want us to come here?"
Persuade +7

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-12 11:00:06)

While the other clears his buissness with Shisa, Someth starts to examine the datapad he took from the bith. There had to be something more in it. Shisa had mentioned Zann, and from his knowledge of the darker sides of the Galaxy, Someth guessed that he meant none other then Tyber Zann, another crimelord.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-12 14:15:31)

Teak moves the crime lord towards the door. The bith stammers, "He's my boss, I work for him"
Someth beings examining the datapad, finding many transactions to Tyber Zann made recently

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-12 15:11:27)

Teak ignores the human's questioning, and continues to move Shisa to and out the door, hoping there was no one waiting outside. Things could get very sticky very quickly if he had to shoot someone.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-15 18:18:20)

Teak moves shisa into the doorway, carefully pearing outside, spotting a few stormtroopers standing guard. THey don't spot you, but they probalby will if you walk into the street

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-15 21:04:25)

Teak cursed silently. "All right, Shisa, what are the Stormies doing here?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-16 13:49:05)

OOC they were there before btw :P
shisa stammers quickly "I didn't call them, I don't want them on me anymore than you do."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-16 14:34:41)

Teak grimaced. He'd have to find another way out. He looked at the Noghri. "How did you get in here? I'm pretty sure you didn't come in the front door. I would have seen you."
*OOC: The Stormies were there before? Oh well, still doesn't change anything, I guess.*

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-16 18:13:21)

Looking up from the datapad, Someth glanced at the TwiÂ´lek.
"No, you wouldnÂ´t. But since IÂ´m leaving anyway, you might follow if you donÂ´t want a run-in with the imps"
Packing down the datapad into his belt, he starts to move towards the place where he made his entry, a small access hatch, probably meant mainly for maintenance droids. It wasnÂ´t very large, but he suspected the other guys might fit. If they didnÂ´t, it wasnÂ´t really his problem, now was it?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-16 18:44:40)

Teak followed the Noghri, pushing Shisa along in front of him. He better fit in that access hatch, or he'd have to blow the heads off a few Stormies. He really didn't need any trouble with the Empire right now.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-16 18:48:14)

Someth crawls through the hatch, swiftly moving through it. Teak barely fits shisa through the hatch, and barely fits himself.

---

### **schubudha** (2008-12-22 23:08:33)

OOC: Is anyone doing anything Istanvisto?
What happened to our laser happy lobster (Mon Calimari)?
Did the rest of the group vanish in a puff of retcon smoke?
Tornik will follow the group to avoid the imperials. Perhaps he may still get some answers as to what the hell is going on.
