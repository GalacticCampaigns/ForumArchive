# [Infinities Saga] Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-19 20:20:39)

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. . . .
**<span style="font-size: 1.40em;">Star Wars</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">Infinities Saga
Chapter I: The Sands of Tatooine</span>
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
The Sith Lord Darth Vader has sent an elite team of his best agents to recover these plans. They have traced them to one Lando Calrissian, captain of the *Millennium Falcon*. Having followed Calrissian to the distant, desert world of Tatooine, these agents are the last hope of the Empire to maintain order in the galaxy . . .**
The red-gold rays of twin suns break across the horizon, bringing with it a new day to the arid world. In a valley southeast of the Jundland Wastes sits the city of Mos Eisley, a teeming spaceport, thriving with all manner of scum and villainy. Calrissian himself arrived only six hours earlier. Someone in this city is bound to know where he is and what he is doing on this Force-forsaken dust ball.
The *Tempest Blade* settles down into Docking Bay 91, kicking up clouds of sand and dust that blossom out and settle over the ship. Its crew â€” Wedge Antilles and Captains Han Solo and Soontir Fel â€” are Lord Vader's elite team. Sith apprentice Galen Marek is with them, placed on the team by the Emperor himself. The reasons for his placement are known only to the Emperor himself.
Elsewhere in the city, Jade Poerce suddenly wakes from her slumber when she senses a presence in the Force nearby. It is very powerful presence, even more powerful than the one she felt in the Jundland Wastes the week before.
Her astromech droid, R2-D2, stands nearby.
*Mission Details:
Vader wants the plans to the Death Star recovered, at any cost and by any means, however he also wants you to capture Calrissian and his co-pilot alive. To this end, the Tempest Blade has been outfitted with temporary holding cells. When you recover the plans and the Rebels, you are to contact Grand Moff Tarkin and arrange to bring both to him. For Galen, Vader is not to know about his presence on the team under any circumstances, by order of the Emperor.*

Jade was fully awake the second she opened her eyes. She rolled onto the floor, the lightsaber in her hand coming alive with a snap-hiss, as she reached out with her feelings. Whatever had awoke her wasn't of immediate concern, so the blood read beam of light receded back into the hilt.
Coming to her feet, she walked across the room, tapping the astromech droid on the dome as she passed him. "We're moving." was all she said to him, before she started to pull on her underwear, and then her tight fitting bodysuit on over them.
The twin suns of this world, had bleached her hair to a reddish-blond. She'd been left here, abandoned, by her master, and she'd lost track of the time she'd wasted on this world. This place meant nothing to Jade, she'd killed the previous occupant, simply to have a place to sleep. And now once again, she started to place up her meager possessions.

R2 came out of stand by as Jade tapped him to tell him its time to go.
R2: *Binary* "It is early for you to be up, why the sudden change in routine?"
To most people it would sound as if R2 was just a simple appliance beeping and whistling but fortunately Jade could understand him unlike most of the Farmers and Organic Scum on this planet.
R2 sets out his treads and begins to follow Jade around as she gets ready to leave and wondering why the sudden change in her.

Jade turned to look at the droid, flashing him a look of mild annoyance. This wasn't the first time she'd pulled up and left everything behind. But it was the first time since the Droid had started to follow her. She pulled the All-Temperature Cloak on from her field kit, and pulled it on over her bodysuit.
"Routines are dangerous, Routines make you predictable. Predictable makes you dead." The human woman repeated the mantra. It was one of many that she had been forced to memorize back... back in the Imperial Palace. With that she turned her attention back to packing.

Soontir Fel sets the *Tempest Blade* down and checks his instruments one last time before powering down the engines. Idly he wonders if all this sand will cause any damage to the ship before ruefully realizing how protective of this ship he's become. While he still misses the thrill of piloting a snub fighter, particularly with only your own skill and your wing mates to keep you alive, the *Tempest Blade* has really grown on him. Perhaps it has something to with piloting the same vessel all the time, something the Empire actively discourages with its fighter pilots.
Shaking the random musings from his head Fel makes his way to his quarters, it's time to get on with their mission. He strips of his Imperial uniform and changes into his "civvies", few people on a backwater planet like this are likely to talk with an Imperial officer. Strapping his DL-44 to his leg Fel heads to the boarding ramp to wait for the others.

## Re: Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-20 07:00:18)

As Fel approaches the boarding ramp, something blurs in the shadows near the ramp, and a figured clad in worn and used robes appears. His face half covered in the hood of his robe, he wears an expression of indifference. Those he traveled with knew very little about him, and the reverse was also true. He knew they were Darth VaderÂ´s elite squad, his finest agents and assassins, sent across the Galaxy to carry out the Dark Lords will. As he had once been.
He was certain that they knew no more of him than the fact that he had been assigned to this mission by the Emperor, and by all means, that should be enough. He had remained secluded during the journey, remaining mostly in meditation or though. He did not know why the Emperor had sent him on this mission, but he would serve. As long as he was too weak to protect his friends from PalpatineÂ´s wrath, he would serve. He often thought about them, of where they where, completely unaware that he was still alive.
He eyed Fel over. The man was a seasoned warrior by the looks of it, and Galen had no doubt that he was capable at handling himself in combat. He felt the weight of his lightsaber against his side, as it hung concealed under his robes. He didnÂ´t belive any of his companions had seen it, and he was pretty certain that they were in the dark regarding what he really was.
Carefully, he reached out with the Force into the surroundings, searching for presences in the Force, presences that might signal that his abilities would be needed.

If Fel is surprised by Galen's sudden arrival he doesn't show it. Perhaps the man's stealth abilities are the reason Lord Palpatine assigned an extra member to the team. Still it was highly irregular, Galen had merely shown up at the last minute with orders from the Emperor; Lord Vader hadn't even mentioned it in the briefing. Of course, the idea had occurred to him that Vader might not even know, but by all accounts he was the Emperor's right hand man. Why would Galen's presence need to be kept a secret from Lord Vader?
Feeling Galen's gaze upon him Fel returns it. There was something...disquieting about the man, but Fel couldn't quite distinguish what it was. With his tattered robes it was hard to tell much about him. At least he shouldn't have much trouble blending in with the locals.
Unsure of how informed Galen had been for the mission Fel breaks the silence, "According to our intel Calrissian arrived 6 hours ago. Hopefully, he hasn't gained much ground."

Han stood nearby as Soontir flew over the cityscape of Mos Eisley. He'd heard of this place during his time working on the fringe, but he'd never had the bad luck to actually come here, until now. The view became nothing but sand as the *Blade* repulsors stirred it up from the docking bay floor. *Why here of all places?* With a look of disgust, he turned from the view port to change his attire. A simple tunic and jacket, accompanied by a pair of slacks bearing his Corellian blood-stripe.
He ran his hands through his hair a few times to give it a more disheveled look. As it was, he looked like he'd just gotten off a refugee ship from Coruscant, clean cut and naive of what lay in store for him. Not the impression he would want to give in a place like this.
The mission itself had him nervous. Being under the direct command of Lord Vader was both a privilege and a curse. Should they fail, a fate worse than death might await them. What also had him on edge was the addition of another member. He joined the ship right before they took off, and his orders were genuine. But his last minute addition is what bothered Han so much, why hadn't they been told sooner? Strapping on his sidearm he approached the ramp. **"We need to be cautious, I've heard this place can be a little rough. No sense getting mixed up with the locals if we can avoid it."**

Galen nodded in accordance to what Fel said.
"If he is still here we should see to his ship. Incapacitating it or rigging it to be tracked will be a good failsafe should he manage to elude us somehow"

As Galen reaches out with the Force, he can feel the presence of another Force-user. She is close -- maybe only a half-kilometer south, still well within the confines of the city. There is something vaguely familiar about her, as if maybe he met her before, long ago.
As Jade packs up her things, she can feel the powerful presence probing with the Force. She throws up her defenses, but not quickly enough. He knows she's here.

## Re: Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **Avarna** (2009-02-20 17:50:55)

Jade's eyes open wide, when she realizes she'd already been detected by the presence that had woke her. Quickly she stuffs the last few things into her sack. "He knows I'm here. Come on, Artoo, we're going."
With that the female human dashed out of the building. She didn't know if this new arrival meant to harm her or not, but neither was she willing to just sit around and wait for him to find her. looking around for the nearest speeder, she makes a bee line towards it, and begins to bypass its security.

Then as she runs out the door R2 follows behind unsure of whats going on, but then he should know by now Force users are a strange bunch but when he is with them their is always an adventure to go with them.
R2 watches as Jade tried to hot wire a Speeder, then decides to intervene.

Walking out from the ship, Wedge Antillies remains silent. For the entire time he has been a part of the team, he has made no attempt to engage his team mates in conversation, only talking when he'd been spoken to.
The mercenary looked around the area in which they had landed. Here, he seemed somewhat at home. The world of Tatooine was one he understood; danger lurked around every corner, and many times it was kill or be killed. Making sure all his weapons were securely in place, he stepped forward to join the others.

## Re: Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-21 11:09:52)

Galen closes his eyes for a moment. So there were a Force-user here. Many times before, such realizations had made him confident, as they meant that he had indeed tracked down his prey. This time though, he barely ignored it. It was not his mission to deal with the mysterious person.
*Unless the Emperor sent me here because she stands in out way…*
There was something familiar about the presence though, as if he knew this person. Given the limited amount of persons in his life, he thought he should be able to remember this person.
((Hmm, maybe an INT check to recall the presence?))

### **Valheru** (2009-02-21 13:52:57)

Fel nods at Galen, "A good idea, I'll see if I can find it."
Now that they're all assembled Fel exits the ship and locks it up once the others have made it down the ramp. He then heads towards the nearest computer console and attempts to locate Calrissian's docking bay.
((Use Computer +7, if we don't know he owns the *Falcon* in character I'll just look for freighters that arrived around 6 hours ago))

As R2-plugs into the system, he is easily able to override the controls and the repulsorlifts hum to life. A few passerby glance over curiously, but then continue on their way. They have seen enough speeder thefts in their time to know one when they see one and to also know better than to get involved.
Back in Docking Bay 91, Galen tried to recall where he felt the presence before. As much as he tries, the memory stays buried within the recesses of his mind, refusing to come forward.
Fel searches the computer database, but no reference is made to any Lando Calrissian or *Millennium Falcon*. He must have used fake names. There were only two ships that have arrived around six hours ago, in Docking Bays 33 and 92, the latter located directly across the street.

### **Valheru** (2009-02-21 16:26:19)

"Well I have two possible matches, one in docking bay 32, the other in 92," Fel announces to the rest of the team. "Since we're here we might as well check out 92 first."
((If no one objects he'll start heading that way.))

Jade smiles as the speeder hums to life. Standing up she stops for a moment kissing the top of Artoo's dome, her lipstick leaving behind the tell-tale lip prints. "Good droid." Afterwards she helps him up onto the speeder, and climbs into the cockpit, and zooms away from the apartment.

As R2 sits in the Speeder he rocks a bit as Jade speeds away from the apartment they were staying in. Though R2 was unsure what Jade was trying to get away from but if she wasn't careful she would get everyone's attention.
R2: *Binary* "There are only so many places we can hide on this planet, most of the towns we have drifted to and from already, perhaps we should go to another since whatever is after you is supposedly here."
R2 knew Jade wouldn't show it and he wasn't exactly able to sense her feelings but he coudl tell she was afraid with her somewhat erratic behavior.

The stolen speeder whips through the streets of Mos Eisley, skirting around a slumbering ronto and nearly hitting a drunk Jawa as he stumbles from a cantina. The streets are still mostly deserted at this hour, with only a handful of people out and about. Though the controls of the speeder are a bit unusual, Jade had no problem flying the thing.
Elsewhere, Galen can feel the Force pulling him toward the docking bay across the street. As he is searching the Force for those answers, a middle-aged Ishi Tib walks into the bay. His name is Drue and he is the bay's owner. He carries a datapad with him, and offers it to the first person he meets. "The docking fee is thirty credits per day. You can transfer the money directly to my account with the datapad."

## Re: Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **Avarna** (2009-02-23 21:32:14)

Jade listens to the droid, but lets herself get caught up in the hot desert air blows her hair, at least until it turns to a blistering heat by midday. Letting out a whoop of excitement as she nearly runs over a drunk Jawa.
The truth of the matter, was the woman had been focused on going, not the where to go. Finally she takes a deep breath, and makes a turn with the speeder. "No Artoo. We're getting of this planet. We're going to the spaceport."

---

## Re: Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **Valheru** (2009-02-24 04:38:24)

Fel, slightly irritated at being delayed even for a legitimate concern, turns to Drue and shakes his head at the proffered datapad. "That won't be necessary, here's 30 credits for today," he replies while retrieving the money and handing it over. "I doubt we'll be staying any longer than a day but if so we'll deal with that when the time comes."

## Re: Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-24 09:45:26)

Glad that Fel was able to handle the Ishi Tib without causing any trouble, Galen picks up his pace towards the hangar across the street. He approaches it carefully, looking around for guards or any other form of security.

Solo followed the others off the ship, and stayed near the rear of the group as the crossed the docking bay. He knew his strengths, and until he felt his opinion or assistance was needed, he would simple watch. Watch both their surroundings and his companions. He'd known Fel for a couple years, when they'd met in the Academy. But the other two were unknowns to him. Antilles had started with them shortly after he and Fel had been paired up. His proficiency with just about any weapon imaginable made him a useful asset. However, he was someone Han didn't know, and therefore didn't fully trust. The new guy, Galen, he was even more distrustful of. He would have Han's attention for most of this mission.
Han saw the bay's owner approach, and quickly asks for his fee, and little else. Fel took care of business, while the others took in their surroundings. Galen seemed to be preoccupied with the hangar opposite theirs, Han followed.

Docking Bay 92 has only a simple electronic lock protecting it. There is, though, a burly Devaronian standing slightly to the left of the main door, and he watches the team carefully as they approach.
Out of the corner of Han's eye, he spots a Kubaz eyeing them from behind a rusted moisture vaporator.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jade pilots the speeder toward the spaceport, but no sooner does she turn it around than two swoops pull up beside her, one on each side. Both are piloted by young, grubby men and both have elaborate tattoos covering their hands and faces in a garish pattern of needlessly bright colors.
The one closer to her, on the driver's side, speaks. "What is it that a beauty like you is doin' on this world? You sure ain't from around here, too good-lookin' for it." If the man is trying to be charming, it certainly doesn't sound like it as there is an edge to his voice that is more threatening than anything else.
The other man very slowly pulls a heavy blaster from its holster, as if he thought maybe she wouldn't see it. Then it hits her that the first man was meant to be a distraction, though he was doing an astoundingly bad job at it.
Behind them, R2 detects no fewer than three other swoops quickly approaching them.

Jade licks her lips, and smiles at the gang member chatting with her. With a purr in her voice she replies. "Why don't you and I find a place to be alone for a bit?" Letting one of her hands slide down her front, making it clear to him how shapely her body was. Even as she reaches out with the force to grip the throat of the other man.

Noticing what is obviously a guard, Fel glances at Han and discreetly indicates the Devaronian. It would be nice to avoid an incident in the middle of the streets and, as long as Fel has known him, Han has always been a...smooth talker.
Fel feigns disinterest while waiting for Han to converse with the Devaronian. In truth he's on the lookout for any possible trouble.

Wedge eyed the Devronian, his hand drifting close to the blaster at his side. He knew that diplomacy was often the best solution to situations like this, and would willing let one of the others talk their way through this, he liked to have a backup plan, if things got ugly. His eyes darted around, making sure that the Devronian brute was their only potential threat.

R2's sensors pick up the approaching Swoops and now that their our already two of them on the sides of the speeder.
R2 turns himself to use his Fire Extinguisher to blind the man on his side of the Speeder, hoping it would blind him.
R2 then turn his head to look at Jade
R2: *Binary* "Three more swoops approaching from behind, they are closing in on us!"

Using the Force, Jade grips the swoop rider's throat with such power that it snaps the man's neck and he falls dead, sliding off his swoop. The swoop then careens out of control and smashes, rearfirst, into a domed building. Something inside the building must have been highly volatile, because when the speeder explodes so goes the building.
The concussive force of the blast forces the speeder sideways a few meters so that it broadsides the swoop. That knocks R2's aim off enough that his fire extinguisher douses a homeless man asleep on the street instead of the swoop pilot.
The pilot pulls out a heavy blaster and takes aim at Jade. Quickly, he fires off a shot which pierces her left shoulder, sending a burning sensation running down her entire arm.
The three approaching swoops gain a little ground, now only about a seventy meters behind.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A landspeeder roars down the street between the docking bays, drawing everyone's attention if only for a split second. And in that split second, Han loses the Kubaz.
Wedge and Fel look around, but nothing out of the ordinary catches their eyes.
The Devaronian eyes them suspiciously, and his hand moves to the blaster carbine hanging over his shoulder. "Stop right there. Who are you?"

Jade curses as the pain lances though her shoulder, pain was good, pain meant she was still alive. To freely use the Force like this was a joy she'd forgotten in her time away from her Master. Fortunately she'd taken the time to properly fasten her restraints, as she got a wicked idea. "Hang on Artoo!"
They had apparently arrived at the spaceport, and instead of messing with stopping the land speeder. With a made howl Jade yanked on the controls sending it smashing into one of the hanger pits, letting the Force guide her to which one. Not only would this provide her some cover from the other swoopbikes, but get her easy access to a ship to steal.
(I'm assuming no pilot rolls will be needed. But she will be prepared to use Negate Energy against a successful attack)

**"Woah there, friend." Han said, raising his hands in concession. "We just got here, and we were just taking in out surroundings. No harm meant, or done. Although,"** Han continued as he approached the guard. **"Perhaps you could point us in the right direction. Frankly on a desolate place like this knowing where you are, and where you're going can be most valuable commodities. So, I just want to know one thing. What could possibly be on the other side of this very large and secure door, that would require someone like you standing guard in front of it?"**
As Han spoke, his hands were busy in motion, both supporting his words and also trying to tell his companions to stun the guy while he had his attention. Han knew from the second he saw the Devaronian that he wouldn't be able to talk past this guy. There wasn't an angle that he knew of without more information.

Galen had hoped that Han would have been able to talk them past the guard, but it seemed the guard would make that harder than they had thought. In the old days, heÂ´d have just ripped the door - and the Devaronian - apart with the sheer power of the Dark Side, but a lot had changed since then. He started to eye the building, trying to find a low place within his reach from where he might create an entrance of his own.

The stolen speeder bursts into a hangar pit -- and into a squad of Imperial stormtroopers. Most of the troopers are able to leap out of the way in time, but one unlucky soldier is knocked over the hood and flies off to the side.
Jade is forced to slam on the brakes or slam into the freighter taking up the bulk of the hangar. Unfortunately, she realized that too late and it slams into one of the freighter's landing struts. Though the side crumples, neither she or R2 is injured, miraculously.
A finely dressed man is with the stormtroopers and at his command, the troopers all aim their rifles at the two newcomers. "You are under arrest for interrupting an Imperial investigation," says the man.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Galen realizes the docking bay wall is far to high too jump over, as it is near ten meters tall, and there are no lower ledges. He does spot a series of crumbling pipes running up one wall that should make it easy to climb, should he go that route.
A few paces away, it is becoming very clear to Han that none of the others have the slightest idea that his hand gestures are telling them anything. It is also clear that the Devaronian got the message as the man raises his carbine and takes a quick shot at Han, missing by a slight margin. The Devaronian then raises his comlink to his mouth, ready to transmit a cry for assistance.

R2 Screams as they hit the freighter's landing struts after they crashed into the hangar.
R2 now knocked of the speeder by the impact but unharmed notices the armed Troopers and they look kinda familiar to him but right now that matters very little.
R2 turns his head to look at Jade and is somewhat relieved that she is unharmed by the crash.
As the finely dressed man speaks "You are under arrest for interrupting an Imperial investigation!" R2 decides it may be time to not argue.
R2 Looks at Jade and lets her know their odds if she decides to be foolish.

"Oh, Please you need to help me! I..I don't know what they're planning to do if they catch me! They're riding swoop bikes, and forced my speeder to crash into the hanger!"

The finely-dressed man looks at Jade carefully as his expression turns to one of concern. He gestures to his troops. "Look for those swoops." As the stormtroopers spread out to the hangar entrance, the man strides to Jade's side and gently takes her arm.
"My name is Eugene Talmont, I'm the Imperial Prefect of Mos Eisley. Why don't you come back to headquarters with us and fill out a statement and description of these thugs? It'll help us to find them." He casts a glance at R2. "Your droid is more than welcome to join us." Neither Jade or R2 hear anything but honest concern in his voice.

Fel's shot hits the Devaronian dead on, knocking him to the ground. He cries out in pain, and clutches his stomach, where the shot hit. The comlink rolls from his grip to stop a meter away.

Jade takes a few more deep breaths, letting herself calm down, and smiling at the man as he helps her out of the damaged speeder. "Oh, Thank you Prefect Talmont. Its so nice to know there is at least one gentleman on this planet."
When he comments about the droid, Jade snaps her head around to look at the droid. Then quickly closes the distance between herself and Artoo. "Oh, Dear sweet Artoo, are you alright?"

"Artoo is alright, and doesn't recomend my skills as a pilot." Jade translates for the officer, as she lets out a sigh of relief, placing a hand over her heart. Only to wince once more in pain. Her wounded shoulder bothering her once more.
"See, Those brutes shot me." She says turning to face Talmont once more. Then she drops to her knees, and pretends to pass out from the pain.

The Devaronian looked from Galen to Wedge, then back again. Deciding it was in his best interests to cooperate, he picks himself up off the ground and approaches the door. He punches in the access code, and the door obligingly slides open.

Perhaps this wasn't as bad a situation as it could have been. Part of the reason she hasn't announced her identity is that she didn't know how the Emperor might have altered her records in the time she's been away from Imperial Center. Now wasn't a good time to try and fight, so Jade simply let herself fall into a trance to better simulate having passed out. Hopefully Artoo would be able to take care of himself, if he wasn't allowed on the transport.

Han was a little stunned by the quickness of the Devaronian's shot, though relieved afterward that it missed him entirely.
**"What did you say to him?!"** Fel quickly shouts.
**"Apparently he understood what I was was saying better than you did."** Han quips back. Everything was over quickly, Fel's shot dropped the guard to the ground. Galen took away the comlink, and began negotiations at the point of Wedge's blaster. The effect was immediate, as the helpless guard quickly gave in to the demands. As the bay doors slid open, the hull of an old freighter became visible. Han stepped tentatively into the hangar, drawing his sidearm expecting more trouble. His eyes were locked with the ship, completely taken in by it's presence.

Talmont carries Jade into the back of the transport and straps her down so that she doesn't get banged up if the journey should get a little rough. The stormtroopers were ready to go, as was the Wookiee they'd arrested (and stunned) earlier. The Wookiee -- Talmont still hadn't gotten his name -- was just now coming around, and Talmont was glad his troops had shackled him. Having a Wookiee loose in the transport was the last thing they needed.
As soon as R2 is safely inside, the transport lifts off, heading back toward HQ. Then the co-pilot looks back at Talmont. "Sir, we're receiving a message from Long-Snoot. Someone has subdued the guard at Docking Bay 92 and gained entrance to it, sir."
Talmont glances at the unconscious Jade, then back to the co-pilot. "She'll have to wait. Take us there immediately."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Corellian freighter looks like it has seen better years and is now not much more than a bucket of bolts. The hull is scratched and pitted, and it's hard to believe it could be spaceworthy. Galen can only find one way in -- a ramp on the far side. A ramp that is locked shut. Of course.
With a final glance out of the docking bay, Fel spots a Kubaz eyeing them suspiciously from across the street. But the second he notices Fel is watching him, he turns and runs off in the opposite direction, quickly disappearing into a low building.
The Devaronian folds his arms across his chest as he stares down Wedge's blaster. "So what is it you are going to do with me now? Shoot me, stun me, let me go?"

Fel grimaces as he watches the kubaz vanish into the streets of Mos Eisley. "We've been made. We need to finish this quickly," he announces to the group. Turning around Fel glances at the Devaronian before looking at Wedge, "Blast him if he moves," figuring Wedge will be all to happy to oblige.
Fel walks briskly towards the ship while studying it. "This must be it, but the thing looks like it's about to fall apart already." Making his way to the boarding ramp Fel (assuming it's locked) quickly unscrews the panel and attempts to bypass the security.

Galen keeps the Devaronians comlink close at hand, listening on it to hear if anything that might pose a threat to them might be going on. Walking up next to Fel, he watches the other work with the controls to the ramp.
"I can sabotage the ship quite well enough form out here, but we need to get in to access the main computer. There are much information in there I suppose Calrissian will want to be kept from us"

Bypassing the lock takes Fel several minutes. That was a lot longer than it should have taken but the lock was a lot more complex than it looked on first glance.
Galen spread his sense throughout the area, but nothing registered to them. The entire docking bay was eerily empty: no fuel pods, no cargo containers, and certainly no other people.
As Fel finally gets the ramp open, the Devaronian seizes his chance to escape. He leaps at Wedge, but Wedge is faster.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talmont grimaces at Chewie as the Wookiee growls. "I don't speak your language, Wookiee, but under Imperial Decree 00034, all Wookiees are slaves of the Empire. Can you understand me? This means you work for me now."
The floater rumbles along, drawing ever closer to Docking Bay 92.

Chewie stiffened as he heard those words. Slavers! There were a few lessons that the elders of his homeworld had been able to get through to him; a select few that, no matter what, he would always remember and abide by.
One of those lessons was that of slavery, and the harsh injustices the Wookiee race had endured for centuries at the hands of those that would dishonor them in such ways. Wookiee's were not weak. They were the best warriors in the galaxy! Chewie's heart rate was rising to astronomical levels. They were just outnumbered! The cowards! He'd get them. No one makes Chewie a slave! The...the butt-heads!

In the docking bay, no one moves for several tense seconds. Then, the Devaronian leaps forward, and Wedge picks off a shot at the man, clipping his leg. The Devaronian recovers quickly and throws a punch at Wedge.

Though Chewie can't break free of his restraints, nothing is stopping him from attacking with them on. He flies into a rage, and his first blow sends the trooper next to him flying. The blow was so powerful, it killed the man instantly.

Only three of the troopers can get in a good shot in the crowded transport, but only one of the stun blasts connect with the rampaging Wookiee.

Han jumped as the Devaronian lashed out at Wedge, and the two quickly escalated into a brawl. Looking to the others, he saw Fel come to Wedge's aid, while Galen simply entered the ship as if nothing was happening. Unwilling to let Galen wander off on his own, he turned to Fel and asked, "You guys going to be alright?" The question was merely a courtesy, as he had no intention of helping them. He believed they could handle the situation without fail.
With a quick step he followed the new guy up the ramp. Han had been on a few customs inspections, but never a clandestine one done without the ships occupants present. Quickly, he surveyed the craft to make sure they were alone.

Galen taps into the ship's computer with the Force, but is unable to find anything useful (unless knowing Calrissian's fondness for good stimcaf was useful). Han searches the *Falcon* thoroughly, but can find no signs of anyone still onboard.
Fel's shot goes wide, missing the Devaronian by several meters. Realizing he's hopelessly outnumbered, the Devaronian makes a break for the exit, trying to escape.

Chewie grabs another stormtrooper flinging him into the wall. He sags to the carpet and doesn't get up again. Jade subtly reaches out with the Force and snaps the neck of a stormtrooper. Distracted by the Wookiee, no one else seems to notice one more man going down.
The troopers continue to try and stun Chewie, this time getting in three good shots, but the Wookiee still won't go down.

"Sir, we're here," calls the pilot, as the transport slows down.
Before Talmont can respond, the key leaves his pocket and flies straight toward the Wookiee, freeing him. Talmont can only gasp in surprise as Chewie grabs him -- now that he's the closest Imperial -- and throws him against the back wall of the transport. The man grunts from the pain as he falls to the floor, but seems otherwise unharmed.
Suddenly, Jade leaps up, her red lightsaber blazing, and beheads a stormtrooper. The rest of the troopers react quickly, and split their attention between the two, trying to stun both. Chewie can no longer withstand the attacks, and with a final roar he slumps to the floor.
Talmont looks up at Jade in surprise, following her attack. "Open the doors! And kill them all!"
Slowly, the back door rolls open.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fel's shot hits directly in the center of the Devaronian's back, a perfect shot. The Devaronian goes down as Wedge shoots him again. Severely injured now, the Devaronian picks himself off the ground and stumbles out the door.
Wedge follows him to the door to keep an eye out and watches as a transport rolls to a stop in front of it and the back door slides open. He can see several stormtroopers standing inside and can hear the roar of a Wookiee and the discharge of stun weapons.
Inside the *Falcon*, Fel gets a good look at the engine then realizes that disabling them could take awhile. Someone made extensive modifications to it and made things more difficult than was really necessary. He was definitely going to need help to disable it.
*(The DC of the Mechanics check is too high to reach taking 10, though you could do it without.
Fel also scored a crit on the Devaronian and Wedge also hit, doing a total of 48 points of damage and moving one more step down the condition track. He's not dead, but he's close.
Two shots hit Chewie, doing 22 points of stun damage total and moving him all the way to the bottom of the condition track. Jade got lucky and no one managed to hit her.)

Still, she took a deep breath.

Fel unleashes a cascade of blue sparks as he crosses two wires that probably shouldn't be crossed. A console to his right beeps as a message crosses the screen, warning him he is making "potentially hazardous modifications" to the engines.
Outside the ship, Talmont answers Jade's questions. "We know he's a smuggler and that he's wanted by Jabba the Hutt. That is why I was after him originally -- anything that is bad for the Hutts is good for the Empire. Unfortunately, that's when he killed my troops." He pulls a datapad out of his pocket. "I pulled his file earlier. Apparently he has quite the record: kidnapping, smuggling, treason against the Empire, it goes on. It's all on here."

The two stormtroopers drag the unconscious Wookiee out into the street, then one takes out a medpac. He pulls out a stimulant and injects it directly into Chewie's neck. As the Wookiee starts to regain consciousness, both of them jump back and train their rifles on him.

Chewie moans a little and shakes his head as he regained consciousness. He had the most peculiar sensation of deja-vu...whatever that was.
Shyriiwook - "No! I want to sleep...five more minutes, mama..."
He rolled over, right on the ground, and began to snore. He was sore all over and could use some rest. It seemed his earlier confrontation was either forgotten in it's entirety or at least discarded as unimportant.

The hatch opens easily, revealing a smuggler's compartment within. And hiding in that compartment is a gold protocol droid. He raises his arms over his head. "I surrender! I surrender!"

"Well, what do we have here? Get out of there now. Do you have access to the main computer on this ship? Answer me!"
Galen stepped aside, motioning for the droid to get out of the compartment. It seemed like a protocol droid, and he hoped that it would grant him access into the network of the ship. Reaching out with the Force to try and sense what was going on outside, he motioned the droid towards the cockpit.

The protocol droid clambers out of the smuggling compartment. "I am afraid I cannot access the ship's computer. Mistress Vell removed my computer interface program quite some time ago," he says, before quickly adding, "Please don't scrap me!"
Reaching out with the Force, Galen can sense two newcomers outside -- a man and a woman.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talmont marches forward, looking directly at Wedge. "Did you not hear her? This is her ship now. Do not make me call in my stormtroopers."
Just then, one of his stormtroopers does appear at the door. "Sir, we woke the Wookiee, but he is, uh, sleeping, sir. He just rolled over right on the ground and went to sleep."

Ignoring the droid as he appears to be of little use right now, Galen, draws out the handle of his lightsaber from his robes and starts out the ship.
"Fel, I found a droid. Keep an eye on him, will you, he might know something"
Marching down the landing ramp, he spots the two newcomers, and his attention immediately focuses on the lightsaber in the womans hand.
*So this is whom I sensed before…*
Putting on an empty expression, he crosses his arms over his chest, still keeping the lightsaber in his hand, but our of everyones sight and fixes his eyes on the woman.

Jade took an additional step forward, and matched Galen's gaze and emotionless expression. If he had a lightsaber, then he was the one she'd felt when he arrived on this planet. She kept her own lightsaber in hand as her thoughts raced. Was he one of Vader's Jedi killers? Or worse was he a member of the Inquisitors? Or did his business here have nothing to do with her?
"I'm an Imperial Agent, and my presence is needed on Imperial Center as soon as possible. So I'm commandeering this ship, and everything aboard. You and your Men will be free to depart, After we've secured the ship and ensured its flyable. I assume that won't be an issue?"

R2 was listening to the conversation but wasn't quite sure what to do, going on the ship might prove dangerous but then what else did Jade have in mind?
Standing in the middle of them all R2 spun his head around to see Jade
R2: *Binary* "Should I ignore them and get the ship ready to go?"

"Yes, Artoo, Go make sure his trained Gundarks haven't done any permanent damage to the *Falcon*. I don't want my journey to the Emperor interrupted by malfunction."

Spotting the small droid that persistently insisted on coming aboard, Galen sent a slight nudge in the Force towards it, warning it to stay away. Then he turned around and started walking back into the ship.
"Wedge, will you keep the little one from messing around in here until weÂ´re done?"

R2's Sensors are thrown a bit by the sudden "nudge" of something unseen, but then it becomes clear to R2 that the guy on the ramp must be a Jedi of sorts as R2 has seen quite a few in his years.
R2 recovers from the initial push and steadies himself, then looks towards Jade who is now reaching out at the other Jedi.
R2 figures they are about to have at each other and makes a break for the ship, all the better if he trips the Force user on the ramp on the way, calculating it has some sort of defense system R2 can use.

Wedge backed away from the ship, knowing he probably shouldn't get too close to the woman with the lightsaber. He cursed quietly as the astromech dashed up the ramp, but chose to ignore it; after all, the guys on the ship could handle an *astromech*, right?
Instead, he focuses on the obvious threat: the woman. Setting his carbine to auto fire, he pushed down on the trigger and hoped that she wasn't too good with the lightsaber.

Onboard the *Falcon*, R2 tried to sneak off. Fel, however, catches him, firing his blaster at the small droid, hitting him dead on. The blaster punches a pencil-thin hole in the droids outer shell, straight through to the other side, miraculously hitting no internal machinery of any kind.

Talmont and the stormtroopers stand nearby, unable to do anything to affect this fight. "Stand ready," he told his troops. "If she goes down, I want him to join her."
He whirled around and headed back to the transport outside. he needed to have backup ready, just in case. As he sat at the transport's communication panel, a flash of movement caught his eye.
He glanced toward it, and saw a young urchin standing beside a moisture vaporator. The boy had the discharge nozzle aimed directly at the Wookiee as he turned and grinned at Talmont. With the flick of a switch, a spray of cool water shot out to dowse the Wookiee. The boy ran away, giggling, as Talmont leapt to the vaporator and turned it off.

He quickly got to his feet, looking around for the cause of this discomfort, and his eyes fell upon Talmont. Didn't he do something recently that made Chewie upset? Something in a van or whatnot?

She fought well, he had to give her that. Perhaps it was indeed so that she was an agent trained by Palpatine himself. Not that he really cared about winning the EmperorÂ´s graces, it might be best for him to relent from killing her. However, if she was a close agent of the EmperorÂ´s, and was allowed to retain the secret of his existance, words might reach the ears of Vader. And he didnÂ´t want that. Not yet. Unsure how to act, he swept his lightsaber in a wide sweep to cover him taking a few steps back and held the blade out pointed at her.
"You are skilled, I have to give you that. ThatÂ´s why I will extend this offer to you. We have no quarrel with you. Leave now, forget you met us, and let us conduct our buissness, and you shall keep your life"
A swift flourish of his blade as he reverted his grip on the saber into that of the ancient form known as Sith Shien served enough to display what would follow if she didnÂ´t obey.

Darth Vader would have laughed at him, scolded him for his weakness, and then put a merciless end to his existence. Kota and Juno had softened him, and it had left him vulnerable on several fronts.

From the cover of an alcove by the door, Wedge let loose a volley of shots at Jade, distracting her as she is forced to bat them away. Her grip on Galen's throat loosens, allowing him to break free entirely.
Talmont tries to back away from the crazed-looking Wookiee, but the vaporator keeps him from moving anywhere. "Please! Listen to the woman! Your equipment is in the security chest in the back of the transport. Just take it and leave!"

Gasping for air as the grip on his throat eased, Galen turned his head towards Wedge and whispered a silent "thank you". Turning back towards Jade, his eyes filled with hatred and he could feel the power of the Dark Side surging through him, filling him with strength.
"You should have taken the offer"
Shooting away from the ramp he hurled himself at her in a vicious assault, using both the momentum of his body and the power of the Dark Side to overwhelm her defenses.

The rage of the dark side fills Galen, and he unleashes a furious attack on Jade. He lunges straight for her, and she tries to spear him through but only nicks his arm, doing no real damage. In the end, though. He beat away her defenses and his lightsaber lances her through the gut.
*Galen blew his Acrobatics roll, and Jade gave him 11 points of damage. Jade then took 24 points of damage herself, wiping out the rest of her hit points. Since the damage was over her threshold, she must spend a Force Point to survive. Galen doesn't need to spend his Force Point.*

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-29 09:33:21)

As his lightsaber pierces through flesh and cloth, Galen can barely feel the stinging wound of her lightsaber in his shoulder as the rage raised him above the feeling of pain. His opponent slumped to the ground in front of him, her lightsaber falling lifeless to the ground. Suddenly the small droid that had entered the ship rolls past him, but he pays it little heed as he kicks the body in front of him, turning her over. As he watches the smoking wound in her gut, a memory flashes into his mind, bringing back the image of him being stabbed by VaderÂ´s blade. That was the first time the Dark Lord of the Sith had betrayed him, but sadly not the last.
Rather than landing the finishing blow, he deactivates his lightsaber and reaches out in the Force and summons her weapon to his hand and then clasps it to his belt.
*Gathering lightsabers from fallen foes…history just repeats itself, doesnÂ´t it?*
Turning his back to her, he starts to walk back into the ship, showing little of the pain that was surfacing as his rage died out. As he passes Fel, he pats the man on the shoulder.

Walking back outside, Galen watched the small droid still next to the unconscious woman.

She would have some questions to answer once she regained consciousness.

Galen almost broke into a laughter at the mention of him getting into trouble, but halted the thought in his head.
*If you only knew…*
Keeping his calm exterior, he seemed visibly unaffected by the captainÂ´s comment. With a voice as indifferent as his face, he spoke to the man.
"Been there done that, captain. IÂ´ll take my chances. But like I said, I have no intention of killing her, as long she donÂ´t tries to stand in our path again. However, if you could provide us with a transport to take us to Calrissian, we will be out of here faster"
As he no longer felt the need to hide their mission (after all, he was pretty sure the good captain had understood well enough not to report their presence), he picked up his comlink and called the others inside the ship.

"Fine, do as you wish. But I will give you the same advice I gave the captain. Forget you ever saw me and my companions. Never mention it to anyone, even to your master. Do that, and you might get away with your life"
He withdrew his hand into his robes and produced her lightsaber. He weighted it in his hand for a moment, and then, without really knowing why he did it, he threw it at the ground next to her.
"If you donÂ´t, I suspect you might need this"
The he turned heel and started to walk out of the hangar, not waiting for his companions to follow. As he walked he wrapped himself in a cloak of the Force, in an attempt to sever himself from the world around him. He felt confused. He wasnÂ´t the man he had once been, but what was worse, he wasnÂ´t the man he *needed* to be. He needed to be the ruthless warrior he had once been, because if he didnÂ´t, he would not be able to carry out the EmperorÂ´s orders the way the man wanted. And if he didnÂ´t, his friends would die. And that he would never allow.

According to the captain's log, when he'd picked up his new co-pilot, Kara Vell, she asked that they come here to Tatooine to find one Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master.

Settling down into a meditative position, he dropped his cloak, confident that the deep shadows would give him the privacy he wanted. Entering a meditative trance, he closed his eyes and reached out with his senses, staying in his trance until the transport the captain would arrange arrived.

In another cabin, Jade slips into her trance.
Outside the hangar, Galen falls into the dark shadows of the alcove, far from his comrades. As he reached into the Force, he felt his destiny pulling him to the Jundland Wastes. Whatever was waiting for him out there, that's where he needed to be.

Artoo decides to activate Threepio first and positions himself at a good vantage point as his extension probes stretches out and activates the Protocol Droids manual switch.
Artoo then moves back as his extension probe returns into its compartment and he listens as Threepio begins to hum back to an online status.

True to his word, Talmont arranges for a speeder, but because of unforeseen circumstances, it takes a full hour before the speeder arrives, piloted by a young man, Jodo. By then, Talmont's transport (and the stormtroopers) are long gone. Talmont himself left with his soldiers, looking around him warily for the unseen Galen as he did so.

Han stepped out of the speeder, having gone to make sure the speeder was delivered personally. As he stood by the speeder he waited for the others to board the craft so they could get moving. He was never one for waiting around and he didn't see any point to it now. As he waited he adjusted his uniform then folded his arms behind his back and continued to wait.

Artoo though happy to see Threepio ignores his comments and turns his attention to the Ships damaged Engines.

Seeing that the speeder has arrived, Galen gets up from his sitting spot, ready to face whatever awaits him out in the wastes. Simply to flex his muscles and control of the Force, he throws himself into a Force-assisted somersault, bringing him high into the air before landing safely next to Han.
He straightens and flattens out his robes.
"Are we ready to go?"

As Jado sits in the speeder, he can feel three distinct presences in the Force, two very close and the third is more distant, toward the Jundland Wastes. But it's the close ones he has to worry about. He gets a very distinct feeling of danger from both of them.

Galen jumps into the speeder, eager to get going. Something was waiting for him in the Wastes, and he had a feeling it might be something more than just Calrissian...
Reaching into the Force, he once again sought for answers, glad to feel that he at least had control over something in his life.

Galen reaches into the Force to find it *murky* for lack of a better term. It's as if the future is too clouded to see. Things could go either way, good or bad, but his destiny is tied up out there, that much is for certain. As for Jado, he's not having much luck either. He can't seem to get a definite sense on the others.

Jade finally brought herself out of the healing trance. Her body ached to remain in the trance, But there were other ways to deal with injuries. Wandering the ship in only her bodysuit, she went looking for the droids. "Artoo! Come to the main hold."
She then took out a medpac from her utility belt, and placed it on the table, intending to have Artoo assist her in administering first aid.

Disappointed that the Force was unable to provide him with more answers, Galen let it go and decided to focus on the moment for now. His destiny, in whatever form it awaited him out in the Jundland Wastes, would come to him in time. It was in moments like this he most missed having PROXY at his side, for it was in times like these the droids would make attempts at his life, forcing him into a fight that would take his mind off of everything. As PROXY had done the best he could to emulate them, he had fought - and defeated - several of the most noteable lightsaber combatants in the Galaxy. He was not sure how he would fare against them now though. He still lacked a lot of his former power, but he intended to regain it all, and use to complete his final goal - destroy Darth Vader, and his master along with him.
As the young driver asked his question, Galen shook his head.
"No, that is what you need to know for now"
He didnÂ´t really care much for HanÂ´s opinion of his own authority, and he wasnÂ´t about to let the man get that impression either. Besides, the man would probably do well to remember his own mortality, if nothing else but for his own sake.
"Fine, wait for them if you think they will be necessary. But do not presume to dictate what I shall do or not do again Han, because I follow only one man. And donÂ´t think the name of your master will stay my blade, or protect you in any other way, because it will not, and you would do well to remember that"

He follows Artoo out into the main hold, where Jade is waiting. "And it just so happens that Mistress Vell did reprogram me before she left to go stomping around in the desert. In addition to being fluent in six million forms of communication, I am now a fully functional medical droid familiar with the physiology of ten thousand life forms..."

Galen meets JadoÂ´s eyes.
"You are right, I have given you no reason to follow my orders. And I hold no rank in the Imperial Navy or any other organization. But since I asked him to provide the transport, I assume that your orders comes from the captain. And the captain saw it fit to follow my orders. Following that line of logic, I can see no reason why *you* shouldnÂ´t follow my orders"
Looking after Han as the man walked away, he shook his head.
"But if you feel that his orders supercedes mine, you can always get out of the speeder and let me take it into the Wastes alone. That way you wonÂ´t have left before he gets back. But I would really prefer it to have someone that might know a little of our destination along"

Therefore I don't need to follow your orders as you have no authoraty. I am not getting out of the speeder. If you want to leave now you can walk or find a taxi that will take you to the Jundland Waste. I hate to break the news to you but the universe was not put here to serve your vanity."

Galen sighed. He really missed the days when Juno was his pilot. She might have turned his world upside down, and asked a lot of questions, but at least she got him where he needed to be.
"No, in that you are completely right. So far, the Galaxy hasnÂ´t really agreed with me. But of course, I havenÂ´t always agreed with it as well. Since you seem to be very loyal in following your orders, I wonÂ´t trouble you anymore. But if you would do me a favor, try to delay your arrival in the wastes just a bit"
He cast a final look in the direction Han had left in.
"I would hate to have someone do something stupid"
With those as his final words, Galen jumped out of the speeder, and started searching for a taxi or whatever that would be willing to take him into the Jundland Wastes.

Following Galen's orders, though reluctantly, Fel and Wedge moved to the side of the docking bay to keep watch over it. Both promptly fell into an argument with the Wookiee, though neither could speak his language.
Though that argument makes it difficult for Jado to concentrate, he senses the connection between Galen and Jade and how neither is very fond of the other. And farther away, he can feel another Force user, one who feels *familiar* somehow as if they'd met once, long ago. That had to be the one he was searching for. The one he'd been sent here to find.
When the droid descends the ramp, Jado turns his attention away from the Force and onto the ship. He spots a tiny but clean hole punched straight through the droid, though the droid is otherwise unharmed. A red-haired woman follows--she must be the Emperor's Hand, if Talmont's information was accurate. She was dangerous-looking, just like Galen. And both had survived their encounter. That, in itself, was almost a miracle. A gold protocol droid follows them, though it looks unremarkable in every way.

Wanting to avoid trouble. Jade makes towards the unguarded speeder, and begins the long journey out into the Jundland Wastes, with the droids still in tow. She didn't like the idea of getting help from an old Jedi, when all they really needed was parts. Would a jedi have starship parts? She doubted it.

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-17 04:38:31)

The Dug gestures for Galen to get in. "Fine, then, but I expect to be paid well."
As they take off, Jado and Han's speeder is directly behind them. Though Artoo gets the stolen speeder up and running very quickly, the other two speeders are far ahead of them. Just not far enough to be out of their site.
It is nearly midday by the time the speeders reach the Jundland Wastes. Galen's cab proves to be the fastest and is some distance ahead by the time they reach the rocky wasteland. The sun beats down mercilessly, though the enclosed speeders protect their passengers from the harsh rays.
Following the Force out into the Wastes proves harder than expected. Whoever is out here is still broadcasting their position in the Force, almost as if he or she wants to be found. The maze of canyons and gulches proves to be difficult to navigate, as no line seems to lead straight to the presence. All three speeders are quickly separated and it's anyone's guess who will arrive first.
It takes awhile, but it turns out to be Jado and Han who arrive at a small synstone hut before the others. It's a blocky, domed building at the very edge between the Jundland Wastes and the Dune Sea. A moisture vaporator sits nearby, considerably taller than the hut. The Force is certainly strong here, but Jado also notices one very important thing. Ben Kenobi isn't here, not anymore. But there is . . . *something*.
The sound of two slugthrowers firing reaches Han's ears. They were some distance behind them, though.
----------------------------------------------------------
Elsewhere in the Jundland Wastes, Galen's driver turns to him, trying (and failing) not to look frustrated. "Where, again, is this place you are going?" he asks for perhaps the hundredth time this hour.
A shot rings out across the canyon just before a bullet slams into the side of the speeder, puncturing the door and leaving a gouge in the leather seat, just centimeters from the driver. A second shot follows from the opposite direction but it misses the speeder, impacting the canyon wall instead. The cab driver curses in Huttese, then dives under his dashboard. He's not really the heroic type.
-------------------------------------------------------------
The sound of two slugthrower shots reaches Jade's ears as Artoo takes the speeder around a bend. Two banthas--both abandoned--come into view. There is no way past them in this narrow section, not without plummeting to the canyon bottom at least.
"Sand People! We're doomed for sure!" Threepio wails.

As the shots ring out, Galen instinctively reaches into his robes and pulls out his lightsaber. heaving himself into the front seat, he punches the controls to keep the speeder moving. As he snaps the red blade to life, he tries to ward of any shots coming at him, which causes the speeder to move rather erratically as he steers it with only one hand.
((Fight Defensively with the speeder, use Deflect against incoming attacks. Hopefully all attacks should center on the guy with the lightsaber, but IÂ´ll spend a Force Point to use Deflect to try to protect the speeder against one attack if necessary))

The speeder moves across the canyon floor in a zig-zag pattern as Galen tries to control it. Whatever he's doing though, it must be working, because the next two shots don't hit anywhere near the speeder. His attackers let out a cry of frustration, one that sounds guttural and almost animal-like.
As if it was a war cry to their allies, two Sand People emerge from nowhere, their gaffi sticks raised high above their heads. They charge the speeder, attempting to hit it with their weapons. One of the blows actually connects, leaving nothing more than a dent in the speeder's hull.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Jade works her a way across the cliff, she hears two more shots, one very close to her. A Tusken Raider--one that she'd somehow missed--leaps to his feet on an outcropping about ten meters away. He doesn't see her.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hut looks lived in and recently, too: the humidifier unit is still running, making the hut's interior significantly more bearable than the exterior. The hut is sparsely decorated, with only a few tables, chairs, and a bed to fill up the space. There's kitchen in the back, along with a door leading somewhere else. A storage chest sits beside the dining table near the front door.

As shaky as the ride was, Galen quickly realized that he wouldnÂ´t be able to keep the speeder moving and focus at the same time. He kicked the terrified Dug hard, with enough force to show his sincerity.
"Keep this thing moving forward, IÂ´ll give you directions in a second!"
For a few moments, he closed his eyes and reached out with the Force. It had guided him into the wastelands, and now it would have to help him again.

Jade charges the Tusken, spearing him right through the chest with her saber. He grunts in pain before falling off the side of the cliff, his gaffi stick flying loosely through the air to clatter on the rocks below, not far from the shattered body.
Some distance below her, Galen hands the controls off to the Dug. The driver reluctantly climbs back into the seat as the two Sand People continue to assault the slowing speeder. "Stop attacking my speeder!" he shouts at them.
Galen reaches into the Force, letting it guide him. Directly ahead the way was clear, around the turn to the left. To the right it was a disaster waiting to happen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back at the hut, Han can't catch a glimpse of anything out of the ordinary, as much as he looks for it. There doesn't seem to be anything to see.
As for Jado, the Force is blank to him, revealing nothing of the secrets this small structure holds. His eyes, however, prove to be more useful, revealing a trap door in the floor of the kitchen.

As Jade crouches behind a boulder--the only place to hide on this narrow path--she spots the second Tusken--and a third!--standing behind the banthas, watching her, but not moving. She gets the sense that something else is up, almost as if the Tuskens are waiting for something.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Dug takes the cab around the sharp bend, into a secluded spot where an overhang shields them from above. Unfortunately, this path is a dead end. Still, it is better than the alternative. As they passed the left fork, Galen spotted what is undoubtedly a Tusken Raider camp up that way. That was also the way the Force was pulling him. Whatever it was he was searching for, that is where it was.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jado descends into the small hut's basement. The stairs are narrow, but straight as he easily makes it to the bottom without making a sound. It is pitch black down here and he feels a distinctive pull in the Force, leading him toward the back.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Several hours previously . . .
Shortly after the others left the docking bay, Talmont arrived again, seeming nervous and in a rush. "We have a problem," he said to Wedge and Fel. "We detected a sandstorm moving in the direction of the Jundland Wastes. We tried to contact the others, but the storm was causing too much interference." He pauses for a second, then plunges forward. "Would you mind going out there and warning them? I would hate to be responsible for the death of an Emperor's Hand."

As they found a moment of respite, Galen turned to the Dug and threw a credit chip at him.
"There, thatÂ´s 500 credits. ItÂ´s for the ride out here, and for the diversion you are going to give me. Take the speeder out in the open again, just enough so that they see you, and then blast away"
He pointed towards the Tusken camp. He replaced his lightsaber at his belt, and instead drew out the subrepeating blaster he usually carried around, and extended its stock. He gave the weapon a quick survey for functionality, and then gave the Dug a final glance.
"It would be wise to do as I say, for no matter what the sandpeople will do to you, it will be a breeze compare to what *I* will do"
He focused his mind for a moment, and suddenly vanished from sight. He would try to use the cover of the Force to sneak as close to the Tuskens as he could, hopefully avoiding too large a fight.

The first Tusken lets out a choked howl as Jade crushes his windpipe. He claws at his throat but is unable to escape the crushing power exerted on him. The second Tusken whirls around, looking for their hidden attacker, as if he knows it's the Force working on his ally. He spots Jade hiding behind the boulder and picks of a shot at her with his rifle but the slug ricochets harmlessly off her cover, leaving her unharmed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dug took the credit chip and smiled. 500 credits? That was about worth the trouble he'd been in. As soon as Galen was out of the speeder, the Dug turned it around and roared out into the open, speeding as fast as he dared on the canyon floor. Several Sand People turned and followed the speeder, including a handful from the camp. Galen moved forward, entering the camp, the Sand People completely oblivious to his presence.
The camp was made up of a dozen small tents scattered around a center fire pit in a vague circle. Several children ran around, fighting with small sticks as their mothers watched them closely. The only men in the camp seemed to be the two standing guard by a tent far from the main circle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jado lets the Force guide him across the room to a table in the back. He has no trouble crossing the workshop-like area to a workbench in the back. Upon that work bench, clear as the light of day, sits a single lightsaber. The lightsaber feels *different* to him, not the way a usual lightsaber feels. This one is *familiar* somehow, though he knows he's never seen it before.
Meanwhile, Han spots a door hidden by the stairs, illuminated by the light coming from upstairs. Without that light, he would have missed it, the door was so well concealed.

Several hours previously . . .
Talmont leads Wedge and Fel to their waiting speeder. The refect glances nervously at Fel, who has to say a single word since Talmont arrived. "You can take this one," he said to Wedge. "The one I gave Jado has a tracking device in it. You can use that to find him. I also took the liberty of finding a map of the Wastes, which I uploaded to the speeder's computer. You should have no trouble finding them. And you should hurry. The sandstorm is moving quickly."

Still cloaked, Galen replaced the pistol in its holster, and pulled forth his lightsaber again. With the opposition minimized, he could draw to using a more effective weapon. He had been a little lax in keeping his lightsaber concealed during this mission, but at least he figured it wouldnÂ´t matter if the sandpeople saw it.
Sneaking further into the camp, he took care to pass behind cover as much as possible and tried to approach the guarded tent from behind, hoping that he would be able to sneak into it without too much trouble.

The first Tusken continues to claw at his throat but he quickly loss that battle, and his body goes limp. As Jade moves from her cover to get closer to the other Tusken--the only path she has available--he shoots her. Her reactions are just a fraction of a second too slow and the shot gets through, though it only grazes her jumpsuit, leaving her unharmed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Galen approaches the tent from behind. The two Tuskens guarding it remain completely unaware of his presence.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pale blue blade comes to life in Jado's hand, bringing a sharp relief to the other objects on the workbench. There is nothing there but a handful of tools--those used to build or repair lightsabers. He finds no other clues to the blade's origin.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wedge and Fel are able to follow the signal deep into the Jundland Wastes, almost out to the Dune Sea on the other side. Thanks to Talmont's maps, they were able to gain some ground on the speeder and follow it to a small hut. The other speeder stopped moving there about two minutes before they arrived.
The speeder was left unattended outside--and the only other place to go is in.
*Sorry I forgot to include the rolls from last round (including Initiative). I went ahead and edited them in so you guys can see.
Now for this round: Jade killed the first Tusken (18 more points of damage) but wasn't able to deflect the shot from the second. She took 3 points of damage.
And since Galen and Jade are relatively near each other, Galen is limited to his per-round actions so that's why you didn't do much this round.

Jade charges the last Tusken but he rolls out of the way, just narrowly avoiding the tip of the red blade. However, Jade stumbles on a rock jutting up from the ground and she goes flying forward. The wildly slicing lightsaber neatly severs the Tusken's head from his body.
Jade lands unceremoniously atop the body, on her back. Looking up, her eyes catch what can only be a humanoid form strapped to the back of the bantha in front of her, hidden beneath a blanket.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Galen pulls a laser cutter from his tool kit and cuts a hole into the back wall of the tent. It's dark inside, though some sunlight does filter in through the white cloth walls. Still, it takes Galen's eyes a moment to adjust and when he does, he sees only one thing: a brown robed man sitting alone on the floor. He is strong in the Force--far stronger than Galen is now.
The man looks at Galen, piercing through his Force cloak. He pulls back his hood, revealing him to be an older human male with a full white beard. Galen immediately recognizes him as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master. "Well, hello there," Obi-Wan says, his voice friendly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jado has plenty of room for the lightsaber tools in his kit, considering he already has a few of them himself. As he pokes around the room, he finds that there really isn't much down here: the workbench, a space heater next to, a few odds-and-ends mechanical objects scattered about, and food crates along the opposite wall, meant for long-term storage of food. He then comes across a semi-hidden door at the base of the stairs, illuminated by only a thin shaft of light coming from upstairs.
Meanwhile, Han spots Wedge as the second man enters the hut. The concealed stairway he is standing in, though, shields him from the view of the other man.

Realizing that the man could see him, Galen dropped his cloak, and stepped fully into the tent. he could immediately feel the Force in the man, power on a scale that far exceeded his own. Power like he once used to have...
As the man pulled back his hood and greeted him, Galen was taken a bit by surprise, but not too much, given the strength the man radiated. He had fought this man before, many times, as PROXY had used his holographic systems to assume his appearance and fighting style.
Closing the gap he had made in the tent behind him, he offered a small nod to the man.

As the blanket flies off the bantha's back, it reveals a human woman, bound, gagged and unconscious. What is most surprising, though, is that looking into the woman's face is like looking into a reflection, she was so unbelievably similar-looking to Jade. There were differences, of course, but it was almost as if this woman was her sister. But she wasn't, was she? Jade didn't know of any sister, but it had been a long time since she'd been taken from her parents.
And somehow, someway, Jade feels as if this woman is important. As if, by finding her, Jade has taken a step closer to her waiting destiny.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So you know me, then?" Kenobi says. "I'm afraid I cannot say the same about you." He gestured to the sandy floor in front of him. "Please, please, take a seat."
It immediately became apparent to Galen that Kenobi was not a prisoner here; he was here of his own free will. For whatever reason he had locked up in that brain of his, Kenobi had chosen to be here. There were no chains, literal or figurative, holding him to this camp. And for whatever reason Galen had found this tent, in this camp--call it the Force, or destiny, or sheer luck--this was where he was meant to be at this time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Jado examines the next room through the Force, he sees what appears to be nothing more than a garage, though there are no vehicles present. The far door is open, though, as if someone left in a great hurry and forgot to close it.
And suddenly, inexplicably, his hand falls to his belt and the new saber hanging there with the others, as a realization came to him through the Force. It had drawn him to this weapon for a reason. He was *supposed* to have it, whatever that really meant.
*Okay, it's Destiny Time! Jado, Jade, and Galen have all taken a step closer to their Destiny. For Jade, that means she gains a Force Point.

She returned the lightsaber to her belt, and proceeded to untie the woman and lead her back towards where her speeder waited along with the droids. This woman must have been the one traveling with Lando. Now if she's here then where is the man?
"Threepio, make sure she isn't badly injured but keep her sedated." Jade ordered. She wanted answers, however she wanted to get them when she had more control over the environment, such as that aboard Her ship.

"I'm not," a voice behind Jade said. "Now don't move, because I have a carbine pointed at your back. Tell me what you want from me. And you, Goldie, release Kara." His voice is threatening, leaving her as to no doubt that he is very serious.

"Captain Lando Calrissian," Obi-Wan said, without a shred of doubt in his voice. "That, too, is why I am here. I received a transmission from him just hours ago and then I found out he and his co-pilot were captured by the Sand People. I'm here to 'arrange' for their release."
He smiled. "Now, may I ask what you seek from him? Surely, it is some trouble to come all this way just for a freighter captain. Any number of them can be found in Mos Eisley."
He turns his head, suddenly, looking into the distance. "And there is another presence nearby, one I have not felt in a long time. The son of Anakin Skywalker has returned."

Jado finds a narrow path, like one left by a small speeder's repulsors, leading back into the Wastes. As he reaches out with the Force, he feels that strong presence again, in the same direction as the speeder tracks are going.
Upstairs, Fel notices that this hut has weathered many a sandstorm before and looks like it can withstand many more. As both he and Wedge step into the small structure, Han gives them no reply, remaining quiet in the stairwell.

Anakin Skywalker. Galen recognized him as another famous Jedi, fighting in the Clone Wars, just as Kenobi. Like most Jedi though, his knowledge was mainly about how they fought. PROXY had emulated Skywalker on several occasions during their sparring sessions. His son, however, was unknown to Galen, and truth be told, he didnÂ´t care overly much either.
"Calrissian has stolen something, and I am to retrieve it. But I have more...personal reasons as well"
A part of him felt that maybe he could even ask Kenobi for what he needed. The man was a living legend, and a Jedi Master. Surely he could be of assistance. But how could he ever ask for help from a Jedi, being who he were, and having done what he had?

As Jade wrapped the Force around Lando's throat, the other felt his ability to breath suddenly cut off. With a gasp, he fired his blaster at Jade, leaving a burn in the small of her back and knocking her forward, into the speeder and stumbled backward, away from her. Jade is able to maintain her grip on Lando, and drives him to his knees at the cliff's edge.
Threepio, who'd been following Lando's order, not Jade's had injected Kara with a stimulant. Her brown eyes were gazing right back at Jade's. Her eyes narrowed. "That must have been some knock on the head," she said, her voice remaining composed and showing no signs of surprise.
"*Kara! Help!*" Lando gasped as he struggled back to his feet and stumbled backwards.
Kara reaches for her blaster, only to find it's not in her holster. She looks around, searching for anything to use as a weapon. Artoo responds by shocking her with his arc welder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I arrived not long before you did and am waiting to speak to the chieftain. One way or another, Calrissian will be released. He has something very valuable to me, perhaps that same thing he stole from you. Tell me, what is it you're looking for?"
He seems honestly curious and Galen gets no sense of deception from him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Wedge and Fel scour the small hut for any signs of Han and Jado, the latter appears from a hidden staircase in the floor, heading outside. There is no sign of the storm on the horizon, which may mean it is coming from the south which is concealed by the massive rock structures of the Jundland Wastes.
(Lando had readied an action against Jade and got to attack when she used Force Grip on him. He did 11 points of damage. She did 17 and moved him one step down the condition track.)

For some strange reason, Galen felt he could trust this man. Obi-Wan Kenobi had been a Jedi Master, but perhaps he would understand.
"Calrissian has stolen the plans for an imperial weapon, and I have been tasked to retreive them from him. And for my own sake, I need him to do me a favor, in his role as a rebel agent"

"I wouldn't do anything rash, Kara was it. I can kill him or just knock him out, the choice is up to you." Jade warns, drawing her lightsaber once more. "So this is the thanks I get for saving you from the Sand People? Artoo, turn off Goldenboy over there."
Oh she'd have words with the little trashcan for insisting on coming out into the Jundland Wastes.

"Yes, we'll probably need to wait out the storm here. Let us know if you need a pickup after the storm clears," Fel replies before slipping the comlink back in his pocket.
Just as the fruitless search is starting to wear on even Fel's nerves they spot a man outside, apparently exiting the hut from an unknown egress. Glancing at his fellow operative Fel comments, "Isn't that Han's driver, Jado?". Not waiting for a response Fel quickly makes his way outside.
"Jado, where's Han? There's a standstorm coming soon, so I would not recommend traveling too far from shelter."

Artoo beeps disapprovingly and notes that he can't reach Threepio's offswitch, which is located on the back of the droid's neck.
As Jade's saber hisses to life, Kara approaches her, unafraid. "Let go of him, you slime-sucking Hutt! You will not knock him out and you most certainly will not kill him. I appreciate being saved from the Sand People but I will not allow you to strangle him as a way of thanks. You will let him go. *Now.*"
Though the words were nothing Jade had not heard before, the tone of Kara's voice bothered her, deeper than even the Emperor had been able to manage. She found her concentration slipping. She could not maintain her grip on Lando and he fell to the ground, gasping. He stayed there, gasping for several seconds as he recovered.
Artoo beeps sadly, asking Jade why she did this. He makes no move to stop Kara.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"You serve the Empire?" Obi-Wan asks, fingering his beard. "And they have a new weapon?" He pauses for a second, ignoring the last part of Galen's statement, then raps his hands on his knees. "That settles it. You must come with me to Alderaan. You must forget the Empire and become a Jedi."
The front flap of the tent opens.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Han steps out of the hidden stairway. "I'm right here. Sorry, I must have . . . dozed off. What's going on?"
As Jado passes Fel on his way to the speeder, Fel spots several lightsabers hanging from his belt--more than any one person could use--and a large, dark shape moving toward them over the sands of the Dune Sea. He can't make out any more as the heat waves rising from the ground obscure it.

Fel looks up as the dark shadows rush towards them, "That must be the storm. We should get inside. Now."
Following his own advice Fel heads back into the hut where he finally sees Han. Fel smiles, relieved to have found the last member of his team. "Ah good, you are here. A standstorm is about to hit, Wedge and I came to warn you. We need to seal this place up as soon as Jado gets inside."
Fel waits by the door, ready to close it as soon as Jado gets inside...or the storm hits.

As Lando continues to recover, Kara speaks. "My name is Kara Vell. I'm a trader and co-pilot of the Millenium Falcon. But who are you?" A look of realization dawned on her face. She tapped a finger to her right temple, smiling. "Perfect recall. I remember everything I've ever seen. It's been fourteen years, three months, but I remember the day the Empire took you away from your parents."
Kara could be lying, though Jade got no sense of that. And, just like that, the memory came back to her, as if she had lived it only yesterday.
*There was a scream, though she couldn't tell from where. Then the unmistakable sound of stormtrooper boots on marble flooring reached her ears. Her mother came rushing in in her nightgown and gathered Jade up into her arms. "It will be all right," she said.
Jade's sister suddenly appeared from the next room, her white hair reflecting the moonlight. "What is going on?"
Before any could answer,* He *came through the door. He cut a menacing figure in his black armor and death's head mask. He raised his hand, pointing and her and singling her out. "You will come with me," he said, his baritone voice driving fear into her heart.
Her father stepped between the dark man and his daughter. "You will not lay a finger on her. She is my daughter!"
"No. She is a daughter of the Emperor now."*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Tusken Raider steps into the tent. His robes more detailed than the usual Raider and with a long necklace of bantha bone. He bows deeply to Obi-wan. They grunt back and forth to each other for several minutes, then the Raider leaves again.
Obi-Wan glances in you direction, a look of concern playing across his face. "You can come out now. If you seek Captain Calrissian, you'll have to find him. He's escaped from the Sand People, along with his co-pilot. And the Tuskens guarding them were killed . . . with a red lightsaber."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Jado watches the dark shape, he can almost make it out. It seems to be a large machine of some sort, maybe a skiff or a sandcrawler.
As he takes the speeder around to the garage, Han walks out of the hut. "I'll take the other one," he says, as he jumps into the driver's seat.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elsewhere . . .
The woman in the headset turns to the man pacing the room behind her. "Sir, the speeders are moving again."
The man nods. "Do it."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jado feels a slight murmur in the Force as he pulls the speeder into the garage, but it is not enough to warn him before his world explodes into fire and debris. He is thrown roughly from his seat and into the back wall of the garage, sinking onto a pile of crates. His body feels on fire as every nerve in him roars in protest.
He can't make it out through the smoke, but it looks as if Han's speeder exploded, too.
Upstairs, Wedge and Fel are knocked over as the explosion breaks through the floor, crumbling the back of the hut. The hut's windows burst outward, showering the surrounding sands with glass. A few tendrils of flame catch on the curtains and the couch, threatening to take the whole place up with them.
*(Okay, let's give a little excitement to the guys at the hut. The explosion caused 24 points of damage to Han and Jado, moving them one step down the condition track. Wedge and Han were not hurt but were knocked prone.)

Suddenly Jade's head hurt, it hurt badly. She didn't want this memory. It It was a false memory, The look-alike must have been messing with her mind! Her mother had been sad about her leaving, but She'd gone willingly. "I'm Jade Poerce." She said Sternly,
Now she reached out with her mind, and drew Lando's blaster to her, pointing it directly at the other woman. "You Lie, Trying to mess with my Mind! I have no Sisters, I serve the Emperor!" It was all she could do to not pull the trigger and put this charade to an end!

Fel shakes his head to reorient himself and stands back up. His ears are ringing from the explosion but after brushing himself off he determines he is unharmed. A quick glance at Wedge reveals the man is stirring with no visible injuries so Fel doesn't spend time checking on him. A simple, "Are you alright Wedge?" will have to do for now. Right now there's more important things to worry about, like not burning alive in their only shelter from a sandstorm. Quickly, but calmly, Fel scans the hut for anything that could be used to put out the fire.

For one moment, Wedge remained very still. The explosion hadn't harmed him, but it had effected him. His eyes were wide open in an expression not unlike terror. For a moment, he was no longer in a hut on tatooine. He was back on that damn space station. He was watching as the darkness of space exploded with light. He was...
He was back.
He kept his head low as his "episode" past, and then stood up, the same cold, emotionless mercenary he'd always been. Only the most perceptive would have notice he was holding his blaster carbine more tightly than usual.
"I'm fine," he grunts, then looks around.
"Who wants us dead now?"

As the tusken leaves, Galen steps forward again. As Obi-Wan tells him of Calrissians fate, he isnÂ´t especially surprised.
"I should have never given her the weapon back"
Picking up his comlink, he calls Fel.
"Fel, how are you holding up? We need to get moving. Calrissian is on the run again, and heÂ´s got that redheaded troublemaker with him. Make it back to the hangar, and secure his ship, IÂ´ll lay chase to them"
Replacing his comlink in his belt, he instead pulls out his lightsaber.
"I guess IÂ´ll have to go after them then. Are you coming, or will you be leaving for Alderaan? What are you going to do there anyway?"
((This time IÂ´ll make sure to wait at least a minute before leaving so that I can use Cloak again))

The blaster lifted off the ground and landed smoothly within Jade's grip. The other woman, to her credit, did not lose her cool in the face of Jade's rage. "You *are* my sister. Don't you see it? The Emperor has brainwashed you. Listen to yourself. How can I mess with your mind? You have a power I don't understand and could never have."
Lando rose to his feet behind Jade and looked from one woman to the other. "You never mentioned a sister, Kara. She's as beautiful as you are. Even when she's angry." He massaged his sore throat. "How did you do that? That choking trick? Would have been useful against those pirates near Iego."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"An old friend of mine lives there. He works with the Rebellion. If Calrissian has stolen a weapon from the Empire, my friend will know what to do with it."
He stands up in front of Galen and dusts off his robes. "I cannot leave for Alderaan without Calrissian. I will come with you." He pauses for a moment. "There will be no need to cloak yourself in the Force, my friend. My masters never taught me that trick and I have gotten along all these years."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Jado recovers from the sudden blast, he peers about the room but the acrid smoke stings his eyes, making it difficult to see. The flames from the blast move quickly through the garage, quickly blocking both doors and cutting off an escape.
Upstairs, as the fire spreads onto the elaborate rug on the floor, the whole hut grows unbearably hot. Still, Fel manages to locate a fire extinguisher under the desk, though it looks like it hasn't been used in a long time.

Jade turned and fired the blaster, intentionally hitting near Lando's feat. "You, Pilot the speeder." She said in a voice that made it clear that it would be bad to question her, she then turned to Kara. "You sit in the front beside him, Droids in the back with me."
She fired the blaster again just to make sure they got the message. Once everyone was in, she turned off the Golden Droid, unable to trust him any longer. "We're going back to the city."

"Old habits die hard"
Somehow though, Galen felt that he could trust this man, and decided it would perhaps be a good idea to keep him around. Ultimately though, he would have to carry on alone. It was the way things had to be. As he got ready to leave the tent to finally try and hunt Calrissian down, something struck him.

"Okay, okay, just be careful where you point that thing," Lando said, as he clambered into the driver's seat, Kara at his side.
Once everyone was inside the speeder, Lando gunned the engine, roaring out over the desert. "Now, which city was it you were heading for? Espa or Eisley?"
Jade caught his gaze in the rear view mirror and knew instantly he was planning something. What, she can't be sure of at this point, but there is something.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A look of surprise registered on Obi-Wan's face for only a fraction of a second. "The Force is strong in you, indeed."
He gestured for Galen to follow him and strode right out of the tent and into the Tusken camp. Whether or not Galen follows, Obi-Wan continues to walk unhindered through the camp as the Tuskens watch him suspiciously, keeping a keen eye on him.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Jado cuts his way through the wall, the flames grow inexorably closer. By the time he is able to cut himself a doorway through the sandstone, the flames are licking at his heels and have singed the edges of his cloak. The smoke has grown noxiously thick, forcing Jado to hold his breath or suffer from smoke inhalation.
As the wall falls heavily inwards, Jado realizes he made a grave error. The section of the wall he was cutting through was buried in the ground--he was in the basement garage, after all. The garage exit only leads out because a tunnel was cut into the rock around it, allowing vehicles to enter and leave.

"Could be any number of people Wedge, but if we want to live long enough to find out I suggest we hurry."
With the fire raging out of control Fel rushes towards the garage. Praying the extinguisher still works he tries to clear a path through the fire to the others.
"Han, Jado, can you move?" he calls out over the roar of the flames.

"Eisley. Docking Bay 92." Jade replies slowly. Knowing that was the Docking Bay where the *Millennium Falcon* was. Lando would no doubt know what what was insinuating, that if he tried anything she'd still be able to find him at his ship. But she also went and rested the barrel of the blaster on Kara's headrest.

Lando nods, betraying no surprise, as he turns the speeder back to Mos Eisely and guns the engines, roaring through the canyon, in the direction of Mos Eisley. His brown eyes, flitting back and forth in the mirror, betray his nervousness. He continues to drive in silence for several minutes, until Jade suddenly notices that he's been subtly drifting off course--at least, he wasn't taking the same route out of the Wastes that she took in.
Kara remains calm throughout this, betraying nothing of what must be going on in her head. Her fingers tap on the arm rest, as if she is just waiting for something.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obi-Wan walks a short distance through the camp, to a waiting speeder a short distance away. "I can feel her in the Force. She is strong, this one, though no match for the Light Side of the Force. She is heading . . ." He suddenly trails off. "We must go. Now!"
He jumps into the speeder and quickly starts the engine up. It lifts off the ground, pushing out a small wave of sand.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fire extinguisher in Fel's hands sputters a bit but it shoots out a spray of foam that smothers the fire leading to the basement stairs. He is able to carve a small path all the way to the garage door when the extinguisher runs out, spitting out the last few drops of foam. Fel can make out Jado's shape in the smoke as he vainly carves out his own exit.
As for Wedge, his keen ears pick up the sound of a speeder approaching over the flames. And his eyes catch the dark shape through the smoke as it pulls alongside the hut.
*(Okay, Wedge and Fel need to hold their breath now to escape the smoke. It takes them about four rounds to reach the garage, exactly how long it took Jado to cut through the wall, so we'll say they're even.)*

Jade notices that they're drifting off the same course as the one she used to approach the canyon. "Artoo, Please plot a course for the Captain to follow. He's apparently getting lost, and that makes me twitchy."
Jade had developed a very healthy hatred for surprises this day, and didn't want any more of them. "I'm not unreasonable, Captain. If you give me a good reason, I just might let you keep your ship, in exchange for helping me secure transport off this gigantic sandbox." Of course she didn't mention that the Falcon was currently worthless beyond its wait in scrap.

"Not for the darkness either...or those who tread in the twilight in between..."
His voice trailing off, his comms Fel and the rest of his companions.

Artoo whistles as he plugs into the speeder system and program a course. Seconds later, a course plotting appears on the console screen, showing the speeder is heading parallel to Mos Eisley. Lando shifts his heading to get back on course.
He glances back at Jade through the mirror. "Listen, lady, we don't want any trouble. We're just merchants, searching for a buyer," he says, though it's obvious he is lying.
Kara nods as his fingers continue to tap on her armrest. "There's cantina in Mos Eisley, it belongs to a Wookiee named Chalmun. All the spacers that go through Mos Eisley stop there. If you want to get off-world, that's where you want to go."
Jade doesn't see the speeder quickly approaching from behind.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obi-Wan puts the speeder into gear and quickly leaves the Tusken camp behind. Guided by the Force, he twists and swerves the speeder at high speeds, far faster than was safe within the canyon walls. "This is a trick I picked up from my old apprentice, Anakin Skywalker."
He pulls the speeder over a low rise and shoots into the air, coming down in another gorge some distance away. The landing is a bit rough and Galen smacks his head roughly into the ceiling. He banks quickly to the left, and another speeder enters your view--the same one Jade left the docking bay in.
They are about thirty meters ahead of Obi-wan's speeder, just on the outskirts of the canyon, heading out.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fel guides Jado from the basement, the flames nipping at them. Though it is nearing unbearably heat, they quickly escape into the very warm, but livable, first floor. The smoke clogged area still makes it hard to breath, though most of it is clearing out through holes in the side of the hut.
Neither of them can see the speeder Wedge left to find, or the mercenary himself, for that matter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only way Wedge could find to the speeder was out the front door and around the side of the hut. When he first sees the smoke clearly, he realizes the speeder is, in fact, a skiff. There are a half-dozen crewmen around, surveying the area, but none of them appear to notice Wedge. The crewman in charge is an older Weequay male, barking orders in Huttese to his subordinates.
Two men approach the Weequay, dragging a severely burned Han between them. They converse in Huttese for a moment, then throw Han up against the skiff. "Whur is dis Captaine Lando?" the Weequay demands, his voice obscured by a thick accent. "Da Great Jabba know he was comin' here. Teel us wat you know."
When Han does not answer, the Weequay slaps him hard. "Teel us!"

For a moment Wedge thought about retreating. He was outnumbered, even if he could get Fel and Jado to back him up. No use in throwing away his life for the man. He even looked like he was almost dead anyway.
Almost dead. There was the problem.
*'You can save him,'* a voice in the back of his head whispered.
Once again he was brought back to that space station. Once again he was watching the explosion that had killed the only people he'd ever truly cared for.

He lined up a shot on the Weequay with his blaster carbine and fired.

Galen held on as the Jedi Master put the speeder through the maneuver. As he smacked his head, he thought to himself that there was a reason that he had always travelled on foot before. Of course, before he had had a ship that put him down pretty much where he needed to be.
As another speeder entered his view, he put all such thoughts aside though. The moment he recognized the speeder, he slipped his lightsaber into his hand. He could not imagine the woman ahead surrendering without a fight, even if she recognized she stood eye to eye with a Jedi Master.

"Your not helping yourself by Lieing to me." Jade replies to Lando, ignoring the look-alike for the moment. "I know there is a warrant for your arrest, under suspicion of sedation."
She took out her comlink with her free hand, and raised it to her lips. "Commander Talmont, This is Jade. I have Calrissian and his co-pilot in custody. Meet me at the outskirts of the city."
Not only was it a threat against Lando, it would also provide her with some needed support, as she doubted that these two would go along quietly.

Fel is about to ask Jado what happened when the distinctive sound of a blaster carbine, probably Wedge's, reaches his ears. He hesitates for a moment, thinking Han might still be in the garage burning to death. However, he knows Wedge is involved in a firefight while Han might already be dead so his decision seems clear. Drawing his blaster Fel rushes to the door, then creeps around the side of the hut.

*"This is Talmont. Thank you, Jade. I'll have a transport there to meet you in twenty minutes."* Twenty minutes was long before she would get back to Mos Eisley, if her journey out here into the Wastes was any indication of how long it would take to get back.
Lando gave Jade one more suspicious glance in the mirror, then swerved the speeder hard to the left. Jade finger reflexively pulled the trigger on her blaster, unleashing a bolt of red light. Thanks to Lando's crazed driving, the bolt soared past Kara's cheek, leaving nothing but a burn. The bolt slammed into the windshield, leaving a series of spider-webbing cracks along it.
Suddenly, the sand split along the ground, trembling as a mountainous ridge rose from nowhere. The speeder rolled to the side as the ground pushed them away. The sand fell away from the mountain to reveal a monstrous creature, brown as the canyon walls and maybe forty-five meters long. A row of short spines ran down its back and two sharp horns protruded from its forehead. If she was not mistaken, it was a Krayt Dragon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Galen and Obi-Wan drew ever closer, they noticed that the sand was shifting in front of Jade's speeder. A shape rose from it, forming a small hill in the desert. Obi-Wan drew in a sharp breath. "We may be too late."
He drew his lightsaber from his belt, holding it casually in his hand. "Take over driving. I will try to stop the creature." And, indeed, it was a creature . . . a Krayt Dragon.
"Your destiny lies with hers now. Don't let her escape, or all may be lost." Without another word, he he opens his door a flings himself out. He tucks into a roll and comes out standing, his lightsaber ablaze.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the thugs continue to interrogate Han, Wedge lines up his shot and lets loose a volley at the Weequay's head. Unfortunately, his shot goes wide, leaving blast marks in the hull of the skiff.
As the thugs whirl about, looking for the source of the shot, Fel joins Wedge outside the hut, arriving just in time to see the thugs' reactions. The Weequay shouts a few words to his comrades in Huttese before he draws his carbine. As his thugs wander about aimlessly, the Weequay walks with purpose, his eyes scanning the area. Within seconds, his eyes settle on Fel. Moving with lightning speed, he raises his blaster and shouts to the others.

*Of for the love of…*
Krayt Dragons. Galen had heard of the vicious monsters of Tatooine. They were said to be formidable foes, and seeing one upfront, Galen did think the rumors exaggerated. He didnÂ´t understand how the Jedi Master would be able to tackle one on his own. Once again, his mind drifted back into the past, and he remembered his battles with the Bull Rancors on Felucia. They too had been though, but not unbeatable. And Kenobi was someone that even Vader had failed to kill. Deciding that he would be all right, all Galen did was to shout a well wish to the Jedi.
"May the Force be with you Kenobi. Bring me back a pearl from the dragons belly, will you?"
He was even unsure why he cared. All that should have been in his mind was to catch Calrissian. Maybe it was because the Emperor and Vader was bent on wiping out the last of the Jedi, and he wanted to see them fail. Maybe it was because Kenobi, in the brief moments theyÂ´d been together, had reminded him of Kota. Or maybe, it was because Kenobi might be able to help him get that which he wanted most of all, and would shun no means to obtain.
Whatever his reasons was, he focused on the fleeing speeder instead, intent on not losing sight of them.

It's hard to make Fel angry, but beating up his injured squadmate is definetly one way to do it. Striding away from the hut Fel points his blaster at what appears to be this rabble's leader.
"Let. Him. Go."
Fel is slow and deliberate to try and intimitade the thugs into listening to him. Then he gets ready to duck when the blaster bolts start flying!

Jade's shot impacted the Krayt Dragon along its flank but if the creature noticed, it didn't react. Instead, the creature's eyes were fixated on a man wielding a blue-bladed lightsaber. It has to be Obi-Wan, unless there are more Jedi wandering around the desert.
And not far from Obi-Wan was another speeder, which is quickly approaching the one Jade was riding in. She can't make out the driver from this distance and through the tinted windshield.
Lando floored the accelerator, carrying them farther from the creature . . . until he suddenly turned the speeder back around. The Krayt Dragon loomed larger in front of them, less than twenty meters away now.
Kara looked wide-eyed at her partner. "What are you doing?!"
Lando shrugged, and a playful grin crossed his face. "I think I found General Kenobi. Trust me, I've flown in a lot more dangerous situations than this."
It looks as if Lando was going to continue, but the Krayt swung its tail in the speeder's direction, and he is forced to concentrate his effort on avoiding the wall of dragon scales moving toward them. Just barely is able to avoid it, as it brushed by just over the speeder's roof.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Obi-Wan charged the Krayt Dragon, his saber burning through the air, Galen takes off after the other speeder--which suddenly and inexpilicably turned around and charged straight for the monster they had just been fleeing. If it was Jade that was piloting, she was good, as she slipped the speeder passed the swinging tail of the dragon.
Obi-Wan leapt into the air to land on the Krayt's back, planting his feet firmly, one on each side of its spinal ridge. He stood not far above the speeder now, his saber posed to strike at the heart of the dragon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At Jado's command, the Force closed around the Weequay's throat, but the man seemed remarkably resistant to it. He growls as he raises his blaster and picks off a shot at Jado, who easily knocks the shot aside with his lightsaber. Surprised that his shot was so easily deflected, the Weequay dove for cover. Wedge shoots after him and catches his leg, leaving a long burn along it.
The other thugs, meanwhile, were lining up their shots at the others, until Fel leapt out into the open. He was such a good target, that they really couldn't pass him up, and he quickly has four thugs firing everything they have at him. (Only four? There were five beside the Weequay a moment ago.) His quick reflexes allowed him to avoid almost everything they threw at him, but one shot did connect.
With a quick motion, Han jumped to his feet. He tries to relieve one of the thugs of their blasters but can't even manage to make contact with the thug, much less take its blaster.
*(After DR, Jade did 3 points of damage to the Krayt Dragon. The Krayt attacked the speeder but Lando negated it with Vehicular Combat. Jado did succeed with his Force Grip check, but his result was low and he did only 6 points of damage to the Weequay. Wedge's attack dealt 8 points of damage to the Weequay. Fel then successfully drew the fire of everyone but the Weequay, but only one attack hit him, dealing 10 points of damage.)

With a sigh, she dropped the blaster into Kara's lap. "If he's going to get us killed, might as well die fighting." As she reaches out and pulls her lightsaber from her belt. and ignites it.

Galen couldnÂ´t understand why the other speeder had swung around, but he didnÂ´t like it. He needed Calrissian alive, and that meant he either had to assist in the battle with the dragon, or force the other speeder to back away from it. Seeing as Kenobi seemed to have things under control, he decided for the latter.
Pulling his own speeder around on an intercepting course, he used the Force to summon his lightsaber to his hand, and as he passed close enough to the other speeder, he ignited the blade and reached out through the window, slashing at the other veihcle.

Fel is not quite quick enough and a blaster bolt knicks his shoulder. A slight grunt is his only concession to the pain and he ignores the wound for now.
Fel lines up a shot on the thug nearest Han, hoping to help him acquire a weapon.
"Han, get some cover!" he yells over the din of combat. Then the captain follows his own advice and rushes for any nearby cover.

"Whatever you say," Lando said.
He pulled the speeder into a tight U-turn, so that Jade was just centimeters from it's rear left leg. She lashed out with the lightsaber and cut a shallow gash into its leg. The creature reared back, letting out a deafening and pain-filler roar. Kara quickly picked up the dropped blaster and fired a shot into the gash, causing the dragon even more pain.
Galen pulled his speeder up alongside Jade's, though the feat wasn't easy with the driver's crazy piloting. As he pulled up, he immediately recognized that driver as Lando Calrissian. Still, he slashed at the speeder, his lightsaber digging in deep. The rear, driver's side door fell away and thudded into the sand. He can see Jade, just two meters away, and she can very clearly see him. And there is a second redhead with them. That must be Kara Vell.
The Krayt snapped at Jade's speeder and the sound of metal wrenching fills the air as the front fender and the hood are ripped from the speeder and tossed aside like so many pieces of flimsiplast. It bounces the speeder's occupants around a bit, causing a few bumps and bruises. The speeder's engine started smoking, pouring the acrid black cloud into the air.
Obi-Wan stabbed his saber downward with enough force to pierce deep into the creature. Then he pushed it even further, eliciting a roar of hurt rage from the creature's mouth. Once the roar died down, Obi-Wan called out to Lando. "Get out of here! The plans you have are more important than my life."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With a guttural growl, Jado charges the Weequay, who turned away at the last second, turning a deadly blow into only a cut across his chest. With a yelp, the Weequay fired another shot at Jado but again Jado blocked it. "Please don't hurt me," he begged, as he stumbled backwards a few more steps. "Just take your friend and go!"
The other thugs, though, don't seem quite so cowardly. They keep their assault on Fel, but not before the two soldiers take two of them down. The other two are shaken enough by the sudden loss of their allies that neither shot hits anywhere close to home. Fel, meanwhile, is not sitting there idly, letting them shoot at him, as he takes cover behind what used to be a chunk of the roof.
Reluctantly, giving up on trying to disarm one of the thugs, Han grabs a blaster from one of the dead men and then rolls under the skiff for cover. Seemingly more lucid than he was a few seconds ago, Han prepares to fire at one of the remaining thugs.
Then, from nowhere, a blaster shot is fired from the top level of the skiff, scraping by Wedge as he went to Han's side. Loud cursing follows the shot, as the thug berates himself for missing an easy kill.
*(Jade did 4 points of damage to the Krayt this time, and that's ignoring DR. Kara followed that up with 2 points, after DR. Obi-Wan did 46 between his two attacks and moved it -1 step down the condition track. Galen did 10 points of damage to Jade's speeder, then the Krayt did 25, moving it one step down the condition track. Because of that, the speeder's occupant's each take 3 damage but they and the speeder have concealment thanks to the smoke.
Jado did 11 damage to the Weequay, who missed his shot in return. The Weequay withdrew from Jado and is now standing at the base of the skiff's boarding ramp. Wedge and Fel both did more than enough damage to kill their targets, leaving two thugs directly between Fel and Wedge and one atop the skiff. The one atop the skiff did 12 damage to Wedge. And Han took his second wind, which he should really have done earlier.)

Lando glances over at Galen through the smoke, and can tell where he is only thanks to the glow of the lightsaber. "Yeah, thanks, we hadn't realized that," he said sarcastically. With a groan, the speeder moved forward.
Obi-Wan glances down at Galen from his spot on the Krayt's back. With a running leap, he leave's the dragon and lands heavily on the speeder's roof, dragging his lightsaber behind him, leaving a deep cut in its wake.
He pointed to the fleeing speeder. "Follow them. I'll keep the Krayt off you."
Unfortunately, the Krayt had the same idea, as it gave chase to the fleeing speeder. Its lumbering pace was slower than Jade's speeder, though, and it quickly lost ground. With one-half of its meal out of site, it turned against the other, letting out a bellowing roar as it came back toward Galen and Obi-Wan.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With a sudden gesture, Jado sent the Weequay flying into the air, directly into the thug on the top deck of the skiff. They collide with such force that both went tumbling over the other side and hit the sand only inches from Han. Neither thug moved again. Jado approached one of the remaining thugs, but can't close the entire distance between them.
As Wedge ducked behind a piece of the large debris, he let a blaster bolt fly. And it kept on flying, as it soared past the thug he'd aimed at, and faded out in the distance. Fel didn't have much luck with his shot either, as it soared above his target's head. He took cover behind the skiff, protected from the thug's blasters--provided they didn't chase after him.
Both thugs looked nervous, and tried to put some distance between them and Jado. They turned their carbines on him, filling the air around him with blasterfire. While he bats away some of the shots, more than a few get through. None of them were particularly deep, but they did leave him with an array of small cuts across his torso and arms.
*(Jade's speeder is now 18 squares away from the Krayt Dragon, and is still very clearly trailing smoke. Obi-Wan dealt 19 damage to the Krayt this round.
Jado killed both the Weequay and the other thug with his Move Object check, dealing 32 damage to both. Both Fel and Wedge had dismal rolls and missed their shots. The two remaining thugs switched to autofire to shoot Jado, doing a combined 16 damage.)

Galen's speeder took off, weaving between the Krayt's legs. The monster tried to stop it out, but couldn't hit the quickly moving mouse between its legs. The Krayt gave chase to the two fleeing speeders, lumbering after them. Each of its footfalls caused the ground to rumble as if caused by a small quake. When the beast realized that it couldn't catch either speeder, it let out another thunderous roar and turned around. Obi-Wan climbed back into Galen's speeder, without having to slow down, showing that age hadn't affected him much at all.
Lando led the group around a rock outcropping and past the skeleton of a long dead Krayt. It was only a few more seconds before his original destination popped into view--a burning hut, thick clouds of acrid smoke pouring from it and into the air. A skiff was parked next to it, and who should be standing there outside it, surrounded my several bodies, but Wedge, Fel, and Jado.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jado leaps at one of the remaining thugs, his lightsaber slicing a deep gash into him, but not killing him. The thug lets out a piggish squeal and it stumbles backwards, grasping at the deep cut. Fel quickly finishes him off with a blaster shot through the heart.
Wedge picks off a few shots at the last standing thug, who looked like he was just about to take off running through the desert. They all hit home. With his last few breaths he curses violently, the falls silent to the sand, leaving them alone outside the smoking hut.
That is, until a speeder pulls up a moment later, smoke billowing out behind it. Its taken a lot of damage somewhere, as the entire hood is ripped off. A second speeder is following close behind.
No sooner does that first one stop, then Jade--clad in a new gray outfit--jumps out with a blaster in hand. She aims it toward Jado, who's still wielding an active lightsaber. "What have you done to General Kenobi's hut?" she demands.
*(That's not actually Jade, but Kara–not that Wedge, Fel, or Jado know that. The haze in the air and the little time they've actually seen Jade don't help.
Anyway, Jado's attack did only 6 points of damage, but Fel killed the first thug with 13 more. Wedge did 14, which was enough to kill the second. The Krayt missed the one attack it got against Galen's speeder before it escaped.)

"Huh, seems youÂ´ve been busy then"
As Wedge moved away, Galen turned to Fel.
"I found the resident of this hut, Master Kenobi, as well as the man we were searching for"
He made a slight movement towards the Jedi Master, and then towards Calrissian. Feeling that it was time to get to buissness, he started moving towards the latter. With his eyes he tracked the woman resembling Jade with his eyes, knowing she wouldnÂ´t be too pleased with what was coming. He kept a reserved spot of his attention on Kenobi as well. He didnÂ´t believe the Jedi would go as far as to physically assault him - which he suspected she might - but he might not be too happy.
"Lando Calrissian, you should know that I have been sent by the highest Imperial authority to track you down, as well as retrieve the property you have stolen from the Empire. My orders doesnÂ´t specify whether you need to be alive or not, but I would prefer it if you didnÂ´t struggle"
He hoped he wasnÂ´t putting on a too hard facade, but he had to make it seem legit. There were too many witnesses now, and he didnÂ´t think he could eradicate them all, even if he wanted to. At least he had Calrissian within his reach now, which meant he could move his plan forward. In an casual motion, he slipped one hand inside his robes and felt the wrapped piece of cloth still remaining there. He hoped it would serve its purpose.

Han gripped his side as he slipped out from under the skiff. "Good to see that someone remembers I'm alive." He grimaces, clearly in pain.
Now that you have a spare second to study him, you can see just how badly he was burned by the explosion. His skin is red and peeling, especially on his face. His hair has been burned short, but it is, at least, all present. He doesn't have any fire-induced bald spots.
Han pushes himself to his feet. "So, what's next? Please tell me we can get off this planet."
Lando, meanwhile, gives Galen a surprised look-over. "I don't know where you got your information, but I haven't stolen anything. I was hired as a courier to bring a package to Ben Kenobi." He flashes Galen a toothy grin. "And fire whiskey is cheap enough that I don't think it was stolen."

Galen doesnÂ´t move an inch at the mans flashy smile or cover story. Of course something like that had been expected, and he wasnÂ´t at all surprised. In fact, he had counted on it. Now was the time to act. Crossing his hands across his chest, he continued.
"Now that would be most unfortunate. If you indeed were carrying stolen contraband, I could have retrieved it, letting you run, and my superiors might still have been satisfied. But now, it seems, I will have to bring you back to them for further questioning. And let me assure you, that is not something you will *not* like"
Unfolding a hand he pointed towards the remains of the hut, and then looked at first Kenobi and then Calrissian.
"Perhaps we could have a word in private, to see if your mind clears up. And since you say you came to see master Kenobi, perhaps he would like to join us as well"
Galen had never been good at influencing other through the Force. His trademark style had always been more straightforward. But he hoped that he had at least made the two men feel safe enough for the moment, or at least curious enough so that they would hear him out.

Jade remained seating in the damaged speeder, before finally standing up. She flipped the switch reactivating C-3PO, "Go help the injured." She ordered the droid, sounding defeated. She then turned her attention to Artoo, "Repair the speeder as best you can."
She then stands up and moved to follow Galen, Lando and Kenobi into the hut. "Technically, Callrisian was already in MY Custody, and was going to be turned over to the Imperial Forces In the city."

A second Jade appears from the speeder, one who much more resembles the Jade they saw earlier. The first one, holding the blaster, smirks at Jado's threat. "You should be more concerned with losing your head than I am with losing an arm."
Following Fel's comment about Talmont, Jade One straightens up and holsters her blaster. "I'd believe it. The man's a coward--would rather blow something up than face it directly, given the option. My name's Vell, Kara Vell." She backed away from the speeder, while also keeping some distance between her and Jado. "And you'll have to tell me if the speeder came from him or not. Wait . . . how do you know it was the good Prefect who blew the speeders up?"
A pillar of flame shoots from the top of the hut as something else inside it explodes. The flames, which have completely engulfed the hut by now, make it difficult to enter, and that explosion underscores how unwise it would be to try. Lando crosses his arms over his chest as he leans against the skiff. "If you want a word in private, you're going to have to do a better job of picking a location." Kenobi, meanwhile,
Wedge is able to get Han into some shade on the other side of the skiff, away from the sun. Han grimaces as he settles back to sitting in the sand. "That was some explosion, wasn't it?"
Wedge takes Fel's medpac and is able to treat some of the wounds, and ease some of the man's pain. He doesn't have experience to do much, but he can help some. And Han looks much better for it. Threepio, meanwhile, finds Wedge after he uses the medpac. The droid heaves a very organic-sounding sigh. "I am familiar with over six thousand types of burns and their treatment methods. If only I had a medical kit, I could treat them."

Galen looks at Calrissian, making no sign of his irritation at the manÂ´s uncooperative nature seen.
"You donÂ´t have to go inside, just behind. Either way, I can assure you that you will want to hear what I have to say"
Looking around, he looked first at Kenobi, then at Jade.
"That might have been the case, but things changes. I have my suspicions about who you work for, and I can assure you that my work does not interfere with your orders. And in all fairness, I do believe you owe me one. So if you would follow me and Calrissian, maybe the *three* of us can talk"
It was a bit of a stretch, he knew, as he really had no good clue as to who she was working for. But from what he had seen of her, she had to be working for someone high up, and since she was a Force user, he became even more certain of that. There were only a few people in the Imperial command chain that ordered Force users around, especially ones with some skill, as she appeared to have.

Fel nods at Han, glad to see the man is feeling well enough to make light of their situation, before turning his attention to the Jade look-alike, "You are correct Vell, technically I do not know. But, we received these speeders from Talmont so he is ultimately responsible for them, at least until he delivered them to us."
Fel glances at Galen, "I am not sure we have time for private discussions. That sandstorm could hit at anytime and good cover is no longer readily available. Perhaps we should continue with the mission."

Obi-Wan joined Lando by the speeder. "He's right. There's no sandstorm coming. Where did you get that information?"
Vell offered a wry smile to the group. "Let me guess . . . Talmont."

Galen wrapped his hand back into his cloak, seemingly careless about whether Talmont was trying to sabotage their mission, or even kill them. It didnÂ´t matter to him, the Imperial captain was a minor nuisance only. One that would be killed if he stood in GalenÂ´s way, but otherwise he could go on doing whatever he pleased. There were very few things that really mattered to Galen anymore. To accomplish his first goal, he would need the help of Calrissian and the Alliance. To reach the second, he would stop at nothing, but he suspected Kenobi could help him.
However, he knew, in order to be able to request the help of either one of them, he would need to reveal his story to them, and he wasnÂ´t sure how they would react. He was pretty certain he wouldnÂ´t be attacked on sight by either one of them, but he might shatter any hope of earning their trust. He wished he had someone at his side to turn to for advice, but right now he could only call upon the only thing that was always by his side: The Force.
He closed his eyes, and tried to reach into the future, searching for answers.

Kara yanked her arm free from Jade's grip. "You!" she exclaimed, surprised. She backpedaled away from Jade, slipping some on the sand. "It's her!" she called to the others. "She's working with him. With Talmont!" She leapt over the nose of speeder and slid to a stop not far from Lando. "She just ordered a strike here, on us."
There are only two effective means of escape from the area--only two that would get you any distance away and aren't smoking heavily, anyway. One is the speeder Jade and the droids are heading toward, though Threepio is lagging behind. The other is the skiff the thugs came on.

When Galen searched for answers in the Force, he comes to one realization. Telling them who he was and what he'd once done for the Rebellion . . . it gave him a far better chance than the alternative. Only darkness lay down that path.
And when he reached out to Lando through the Force, he found a mind willing to accept him. Lando's head whipped around from watching Kara to staring at Galen. "All right. I'll trust you. For the moment. If you try to pull anything, I have a Jedi who can take off your head," he said, jerking a thumb in Obi-wan's direction.
When no one else answered Wedge's question, Kara did as she headed for the skiff. "I don't think those thug's were Talmont's. If he needs foot soldiers, he has hundreds of stromtroopers available. No, they have to belong to someone else" And, with that, she disappeared into the skiff.

"Perhaps...I do not wish to test that. But please, come with me. There are things that I must tell you...things you will want to hear..."
He wrapped his cloak tighter around him, and inside it, and one hand clutched the piece of cloth he kept there. He started to move aside, passing Fel with a look that would tell the man that he did not wish to be disturbed. As he passed Jade, he merely looked at her. He decided that it would not be worth the effort to try and talk her out of following if that was still what she intended to do. But unless he could be certain that she would not endanger her plan, he now considered her life forfeit.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-12 16:28:35)

As he moved aside from the rest of the group with Obi-Wan and Lando, Galen drew in a deep breath.
"Before I tell you my proposal, there is something else that you must know. Please listen to my story before saying anything"
Letting his gaze slide over Kenobi and Calrissian, Galen began to talk.
"As you might be aware of, shortly after the end of the war, Imperial forces invaded the Wookie world of Kashyyk. Present during this invasion was Palpatine´s newly appointed warlord, Darth Vader, but not because the troops needed his leadership. Imperial spies had tracked a fugitive Jedi by the name of Kento Marek there, and Vader traveled there to silence him. However, as he looked down upon the Jedi´s corpse, Vader found something he had not expected. A boy, strong enough in the Force to tear the lightsaber from Vader´s hand, and brave enough to threaten him with it. In secret, Vader took the boy from Kashyyk, and began to raise him as his apprentice, and train him in the ways of the Sith and the Dark Side. In time, the boy would become a man, and Vader would send him to bring the enemies of the Empire to justice. In time, he would send him to hunt Jedi. But something went wrong, and the Emperor discovered that Vader had secretly been raising an apprentice to help him ascend to power. Vader dispatched his apprentice and told him to gather the enemies of the Empire, and use them as a distraction so that they would be able to strike. With the aid of a former Jedi Master named Rahm Kota, the apprentice and his pilot, Juno Eclipse rounded up three Imperial senators, willing to take action against Palpatine. Their names was Bail Organa, Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis"
As he looked around the two men again, his gaze and face grew heavier and he looked to the ground.
"But it was all a lie. Everything had been plotted by Vader and his master from the beginning. They had lured the apprentice into gathering the enemies of the Empire so that they could be eliminated in a single swift strike. Their gathering was ambushed, the senators and Kota taken, and the apprentice left for dead. But he survived, and tracked Vader to the construction site of the new superweapon - the Death Star. There he challenged Vader to a duel, and defeated him. He even went against Palpatine, and nearly brought the Emperor to his knees. But his heart betrayed him, and instead of finishing the evil off once and for all, he sacrificed himself to save his friends and let them escape. But he did not die. He was brought back to life by Palpatine and the Dark Side of the Force, now sentenced to serve the Emperor´s bidding as his hunter, or feel the pain of his friends dying"
He raised his gaze, and looked at them with eyes of steel.
"My name is Galen Marek, and I was once Darth Vader´s apprentice. And I need your help, Lando Calrissian, and that of the Rebel Alliance. I need you to find Rahm Kota and Juno Eclipse, and keep them out of the Emperor´s reach. If you do this, when they are safe, I shall join your cause once again, and bring the Empire down"
He produced a tattered piece of cloth from his robes, and handed it to Lando, revealing the rebel insignia on it.
"This will verify my existence to the senators, as they all saw it the day the Alliance was formed. My family emblem. I will let you get back to them alive, but in exchange you must return that which you stole from the Empire, or else I will be discovered. If possible, I can produce the data at a later opportunity"
He turned to Kenobi.
"I never knew you were here master Kenobi, but I would ask you to assist Calrissian in finding my friends. And...I will need someone to help me regain the strength that I´ve lost, so that I can destroy Vader once and for all. But I cannot leave the Emperor´s side before they are safe"
As a cool desert wind caught his robes, he waited for their reaction in silence.

On the far side of the hut, well out of earshot from the others, Obi-Wan and Lando stood quietly for a few seconds, absorbing Galen's speech. Lando looked down at the insignia, in his hands. "You're Galen Marek? You've got a lot of guts, facing the Emperor like that." He paused for a second, as he tucked the insignia into a pocket. "I can't give you the information we have. You've seen the Death Star; you have to know why I can't do it."
Obi-Wan nodded. "You must come with us. Abandon the Empire, Galen. Break free of the Emperor's grasp. Nothing lies down the path of the Dark Side except pain and suffering. The Rebellion needs you now. They need someone like you."
Suddenly, Obi-Wan drew in a sharp breath. "We need to continue this elsewhere. We need to move now."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jade ignored Wedge except to cast him a withering glance, daring him to shoot her. She helped her droid, R2, into her chosen speeder, then followed him in. In a few seconds--once Threepio had reached the speeder--she would gun that engine and be gone to the Force knew where.
The Force provided no insight to Jado. Both courses of action had the good and bad, but neither was immediately dangerous. Staying here was, though, as he heard the all-too-familiar whine of the TIE Fighter on the approach. They were coming from the south, toward Mos Eisely. Talmont was many things--quick was apparently one of them.
Fel heard them, too. He helped Han to his feet and gestured toward the others to hurry for the skiff. "Let's go! Let's go! We've got company coming!"
(Okay, I made a Persuasion check for Galen, with modifiers thanks to his spectacular speech. They believe him to be who he says he is, though Lando's a little wary still.
Galen, Lando, and Obi-Wan need three Move Actions to get on the skiff, everyone else needs only one. Threepio is still a full-round away from joining Jade, and three moves from Wedge, though he can reach him with a Run, if he chooses.
No body has spotted the TIES yet, and no one can tell their approximate distance, either.)

Fel has an uneasy feeling, and it's not just from the incoming TIEs. In fact, under normal circumstances the whine of an ion engine would be comforting, making Talmont's betrayal all the more keenly felt. With the rogue's gallery of "companions" they've picked up it felt like Han, Wedge, and Fel were quickly losing control of this mission. And now their mysterious fourth member, Galen, was having private discussions with their quarry, a known criminal. Perhaps he'd have been better off just sticking to a TIE fighter.
All of these thoughts flash through Fel's head in the few seconds it takes him to reach the skiff, before he reminds himself to focus on their immediate situation. Seeing Wedge approach the protocol droid Fel points his blaster at Jade. She could go about her business but as far as he was concerned that droid now belongs to the Empire. As willful as she proved earlier he doubts she'll go along with this news peacefully.

Jado has to push past Kara to get to the pilot's seat, but she let's it slide. HE starts the engine, and it rumbles smoothly to life, like any well-maintained machine.
Kara settles into the co-pilot's seat and aids him with the warm-up, paying close attention to the sensor readouts. "Looks like our friends are three kilometers out. At the speeds they're moving, we have about fifteen seconds before they glass us. I hope this thing has weapons."
If Jado looks around the small cockpit, he can immediately tell there are no weapons controls there. If they did have weapons, he wasn't going to be able to fire them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Fel and Wedge move to secure the droid, Jade's glare turns venemous. They know that she knows she's in no condition to fight them. With a deep, guttural growl, she turns away and floors the accelerator, disappearing in a flurry of sand. Wedge and Fel can see the sand cloud as it turns back toward the Waste and disappears into a canyon.
"Oh dear," Threepio sighs, as he watches it go. "It looks like I've lost Artoo again. Blast these metal legs! They didn't move fast enough! You might as well just scrap me now."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Of course not," Lando mutters under his breath as he jogs toward the skiff. "Why would you make things easy for us?"
Obi-Wan follows close behind Galen. "I will do what I can to aid your friends."
The whine of the TIEs has grown loud enough for everyone to hear clearly, though only faintly. It's obvious to everyone that that they don't have much time.
*(You have three rounds until the TIEs arrive–if Kara's correct. It'll take at least two rounds for everyone to get aboard, unless you can convince Threepio to run. Fel is standing outside the ramp. Galen, Obi-Wan, and Lando are four squares away, and can use the last two squares of any movement to move around inside. Wedge and Threepio are 16 squares away.)*

Galen spots a ladder at the skiff's rear, leading up. The hatch above it is unlocked.

Though Wedge looks for weapons, the only one he finds is a vibro axe left behind by one of the thugs before they exited the skiff. There are power cables running into the ceiling, though, and Wedge knows enough about weapons to know there must be some serious weaponry up above.
Galen does find those weapons: four blaster cannons, two positioned to each side of the skiff. The only other thing up there is the dead body of one thug, a smoking hole just below his neck. His stench--not a stench of death but just unwashed combined with burnt flesh--permeates the air up there.
Threepio finally scrambles aboard, and Jado guns the engine. Smoothly, it accelerates away from the TIEs, but its speed is no match for them. They'll still catch up, but he delayed the inevitable for a while.
Fel looks over the controls, but doesn't see anything that could immediately help them. No weapons controls, and certainly no shields. Then his eyes settled on the engine readouts. For some reason, they weren't operating at full capacity. If they were it might give them a speed boost--or there might be a good reason the thugs didn't have them operating at full power. The engines are accessible from inside the skiff, at the back.
(Thanks to Jado's speed, you still have two rounds until the TIEs arrive.)

A grin spread across Wedge's face; he made a mental note to grab the Vibroax before leaving the skiff. Silently complying with the command Galen had given, he ascends to the top of the skiff. His grin widens as he takes one of the guns and prepares for the arrival of the TIE fighters.

Though few would have thought it possible Fel's face grows even grimmer than normal at the thought of shooting down TIEs. The pilots were just doing their jobs, he doubted they knew the Prefect had targeted Imperials. Still, the mission was more important and its success, not to mention their own survival, might depend on shooting the flyboys down.
Fel rushes to the back of the skiff, ignoring Galen for now. He quickly looks over the engines, trying to determine why they aren't operating at full capacity and if it would be dangerous to restore them.

Han follows Wedge onto the second level, and they power up the weapons alongside Galen. The controls vibrate slightly in their hands as the power courses through it. In the distance, they can see the specks that are the TIEs--three of them--form into more distinct shapes. A few seconds later, they entered firing range.
Down below, Fel fiddled with the engines. The patchwork system the thugs used was wildly inefficient. With a few tweaks, Fel was certain he could work more power from the engines. There was a small danger of explosion--but it was very small and, as long as he didn't slip, he should be fine.
Jado guides the skiff along the desert, whipping up clouds of sand behind them. With his current maneuvering, he wasn't kicking up much sand but he might be able to shield them with it a bit if he tried some really fancy maneuvering.
*(On any round Jado does not use all-out movement, he can spend a move action to kick up a cloud of dust. For every +2 he chooses to add to Reflex Defense, the skiff's gunners suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls.
Valheru, I assumed you wanted to spend the FP on your Mechanics roll to fix the engines, not just diagnose them, so I didn't add it in this time and you didn't need it. So you still have it if you want to do it in the next round.
The TIEs fell last in Initiative, excluding Han, so everyone can act before they fire.)*

Searching for the TIEs in the horizon, Galen swings the weapon to match their trajectory, letting the Force guide his hand. When he feels the timing is right, he squeezes the trigger.

Jado does a few rapid S curves kicking up some dust and keep trying to out pace the Tie fighters though it is likely not to happen. Jado starts keeping an eye out for cover like a canyon.

## Re: Chapter 1: The Sands of Tatooine

### **Anonymous** (2009-09-06 23:42:02)

Just before Jado kicks up the cloud of dust, he spots an opening in the canyon wall. It's narrow, but the skiff should easily make it. Then the sand clouds everything and he loses sight of it.
As the sand blows up into their faces, it becomes more difficult to hit the incoming TIEs, and Galen's and Wedge's shot both miss, and by a considerable margin. The TIEs, though, fare no better, melting the sand beside the skiff into rippled sheets of glass. They were close, though, and they certainly couldn't count on the TIEs missing again. Han repositions his gun to follow the source of the shots, but his goes wide as well.
Down below, Fel continues to work on the engines, trying to boost their power. He just needs more time. Lando comes up beside him and flinches when a panel sparks. "What do you need?"
(Okay, the skiff's weapons add +2 to the attack rolls, which was negated this round by the Defense bonus Jado gave the speeder--and that was the only reason one of the TIEs missed. Fel needs three more rounds to complete his modifications of the engines and Lando is now aiding him.)

As the sand blew into his face, Galen found it hard to concentrate on firing and the shots went wide. Drawing a deep breath, he expanded outwards in the Force to try and sense, rather than see the opponent, hoping for better luck as he fires again.

### **Anonymous** (2009-09-16 23:21:41)

Jado's deft maneuvering keeps the TIE's off them, certainly, but he's not making it easy for Fel to work on the engines, either. At least he has Lando, and is able to maintain the progress. The panel harmlessly sparks. He's so close, just a few more seconds . . .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jado spins around the nose of the skiff coming out of the dust cloud. Kara points sharply left. "There! The canyon!"
Jado glimpses it briefly before the cloud envelopes them again. He just may be able to make it . . . if the TIEs don't blow them back to Coruscant first.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Galen, Wedge, and Han continue their assault on the TIEs, firing away in rapid bursts. Wedge's shot goes wild, and Han nearly hits his target, missing by less than three meters. Reaching out with the Force, Galen is not able to get a clear picture of the TIEs, but he catches enough of a glimpse to help his shot hit home. The leftmost TIE wobbles a bit to the right--not enough to crash it into the middle of their formation, but almost. A dark burn is left along the wing and the TIE is still clearly suffering.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The TIEs fire back in a wild pattern, hoping to maybe just hit something. Unfortunately, one of those shots connected with the skiff's hull. Everyone is knocked violently to the side, though Jado, Wedge, Fel, and Obi-Wan are able to stay in place. Galen goes sliding backward across the deck, slamming hard into a railing but otherwise unhurt. Lando and Kara end up on the deck.
*(Galen did 38 damage to the TIE (after DR) and moved it one step down the condition track. The middle TIE's shot did 27 points of damage to the skiff after DR.
Jado spotted the canyon and can get to it in the next round, but only if he uses two move actions and doesn't kick up dust. If he makes it in, he may or may not get cover this round. If he kicks up dust, he'll need to wait at least one more round in the open, but with a guaranteed cover bonus.
Galen can use Sense Surroundings every round to look for the TIEs negating half the cover bonus provided by the sand and he can negate that extra point if he beats the DC by 5 or more. However, because of difficulty concentrating with sand blowing into his face, he suffers a -2 penalty to the check.
Fel needs two more rounds to complete his modifications. As long as Lando stays with him, he'll receive a +2 bonus on his Mechanics check.)*

"Nice shot," Wedge calls over to Galen, before feeling the voilent jerking of the skiff being hit.

The cloud of dust gives them some cover as Jado makes for the canyon. He can't get the skiff quite to it, but it's close. Fel, too, is nearly finished with his modifications.
The three on the roof fire again, following one shot with another and another. Galen's shot clips his target's wing, and sends it careening down to the desert floor, where it vanishs in a fireball and a rolling wall of sand and heat. Wedge blasts a shot directly through the forward viewport of the center TIE, killing the pilot while leaving the ship otherwise intact--that is, until it hit the ground.
The other TIE tries to avenge his comrades' deaths, but his wild shots come nowhere close to the skiff. Han fires at it, but his shot barely glances off, leaving nothing more than a scorch mark as a reminder.
*(Galen did 26 points of damage after DR, finishing it off. Han did a whole 8 points of damage after DR. Wedge, however, scored a crit, doing a whopping 94 points of damage after DR was applied.
Fel needs one round to complete his modifications/repairs and Jado needs the same amount of time to reach the canyon.)*

As Jado guides the skiff between the canyon walls, Wedge and Galen pick off a few more shots. As Galen's suppressive fire keeps the TIE from leaving, Wedge peppers it with shots, punching holes into it hull. Smoke pouring from it, it crashes into the canyon rim, unable to maneuver in its narrow walls.
Just then, Fel finishes his engine work. The engines receive a sudden burst of power, and the skiff surges forward. It takes every ounce of Jado's skill to keep the skiff from smashing into the canyon walls and becoming like that last TIE.
Jado guides the skiff through the narrow canyon, winding and twisting their way back to the city of Mos Eisley, at first in the canyon and then out in the open desert. The heat only grows more oppressive as time wears on. It takes a few oddly calm hours but once again they find themselves approaching the walls of that wretched hive of scum and villainy--as Obi-wan so poetically called it.
The place is crawling with stormtroopers: stormtroopers in desert gear, stormtroopers on dewbacks, and stormtroopers in AT-ST's. It seems as if Talmont brought out the big guns--and that he's looking for something.
*(Wedge did 56 points of damage after DR, nearly enough to destroy it, and moved it one step down the condition track. It then failed its Pilot check to follow you into the canyon, so it blew itself up that way. Galen's action was pretty much pointless, then, but I included a version of it for dramatic effect. Fel also successfully boosted the engines, adding 2 squares to its Speed, for now.
I brought you back to Mos Eisely, assuming that's where Jado is headed. If not, I can edit the post.)*

Galen was a bit worried. Not about the abundance of stormtroopers present, he had deal with far worse when serving as Vader´s assassin. And not about being able to get away unseen, stormtroopers were about as easy to fool as they were numerous. But what he was worried about was the fact that it seems to become very difficult to allow Calrissian and Kenobi to "slip away" from custody without the others getting suspicious.

The Imperial troops let the skiff pass by unhindered, as they were clearly looking for something else--that was, until they reached a check point set up around the docking bays. The stormtroopers were checking every vehicle going in and out of the area, and they dragged more than a few people away in binders, including a particularly irate Devaronian. Going by unnoticed in the skiff would be impossible.
The suns are hanging low in the west, about a hour from setting. If they follow standard Imperial procedure--and with Talmont in charge there is little doubt that will happen--the patrols will increase for the first three hours after sunset. After that, they'll cut back a little. With less people moving about though, the odds will still be greatly in favor of Talmont's troops. Obi-Wan is quick to remind you of these facts, as if he had spent far too much time in the presence of Imperial soldiers.

At first, Jado doesn't spot anything as he laps the docking bays, but then he spots it--a high wall joining two adjacent buildings. The wall--made of sandstone and nearly four meters high--is unpatrolled by any guards, though getting up and over it without attracting notice won't be easy.
A stormtrooper commander, though, noticed the suspicious circling of the area. He jogged over with two of his associates--the only three in the visible area, about twenty meters out from the wall.
Kara glared at Jado. "That was great work you did there, nerfherder."
Lando shrugged. "What do you expect, Kara? They're Imperials, they don't have brains." Before anyone could take him to task for his remark, he held up his hands in surrender. "I'm not looking for a fight."

The *Tempest Blade* sits right where it was left, in the center of Docking Bay 91, a fine coating of dust dulling its previously shining, white exterior. The moment the skiff comes to a rest inside the bay, Han and Fel head to the ship , unlocking it and preparing it for departure. Wedge, Jado, and Galen seem to be left with guarding the prisoners for the moment.
Obi-Wan draws Galen aside and looks him in the eyes. He whispers quietly, to avoid Jado's or Wedge's prying ears. "It seems our destinies now lie along the same path, unless you have a plan. But unless you have another ship, your allies will continue to pursue us across the planet's surface."

Wedge points Lando out the door, and the Rebel reluctantly follows the unspoken order. "Bring the woman. The Empire will pay something for a second Rebel."
He follows Lando out the door, keeping his blaster trained on him, and both head into the ship. Kara shakes her head and follows, resigned to her fate for the time being. It was odd, how quickly she went from being so strong-willed to being somber.
That left Galen and Obi-Wan up top, and Jado below. Obi-Wan glanced down as he felt the hate rolling off of the Inquisitor. "Don't give into your hate, young one. It leads to the dark side." Obi-Wan then looked at Galen. "Watch him carefully. He's in a dangerous spot right now, on the precipice of the dark side. He hasn't fallen, not yet, but he isn't far. He reminds me much of my old apprentice . . . "
Something caught the old man's eyes then, and he glanced at Jado's hands, and the saber in them. A flicker of something . . . recognition, maybe? . . . flashed across them, but was gone. Obi-Wan was quick to follow. Just like that, in a burst of speed, the aged Jedi master was out of sight.

No one bothered chasing after Obi-Wan--no one needed to. They knew, as a Jedi Master, he would be very difficult to catch. After all, he'd survived this long against the Empire.
It didn't matter anyway. They had Lando and Kara, and that's really who they needed. And Lando had the plans on him, on a datastick that Han found when patting him down. While he tried to fight for it, he really had no defense against the others.
As the *Tempest Blade* lifted off of Tatooine's surface, alarms blared at the spaceport. By the time Talmont had launched his fighters, though, there was no hope they'd ever catch the *Blade*. They were simply too far away.
All they needed now was a destination for the navcomputer to calculate. Tarkin had given orders to contact him once Lando was in their custody . . . but things had changed since they'd landed on the dustball that was Tatooine. Was this really their best course of action?

Wedge watched the surface of the planet recede away from him through a window as they took off. Once past the fighters and confident they would not be attacked, he joined the rest of the group. He could feel tension in the room, and ironically for him, decided to be the first to break the silence.
"So, where are we going with these two?" Wedge asks.
"It seems we've made an enemy of at least someone in the Empire, and I'd rather not get shot or executed when we land."
The tone of his voice and his body language suggests that he has no strong feelings either way as far as a sollution goes.

"What´s this Wedge, getting jumpy? I though you guys served the most powerful warlord in the Empire. I would say you are pretty safe from anything a garrison commander on a backwater world like this can do"

"I just don't like leaving things like this to chance. In my experience, when things can go wrong, they will."

"Do what you will then Wedge, but I just thought I should remind you who you´d be crossing should you decide to abandon your post. You guys were the ones tasked with this mission though, so you should be the ones to report its success. I was just sent along to assisst, and my presence in this operation is to remain completely unnoticed, ok? I will be returning back to my master to receive further instructions"

With that final thought, they contacted the Empire. Grand Moff Tarkin himself took the transmission in his office.
"Bring Calrissian to Ralltiir. I will be arriving with the Emperor's battlestation in two days. Bring Calrissian and the girl aboard. Lord Vader will interrogate them himself. We will find the location of their hidden base, and we will destroy them."
And with that, the transmission ends.

Remaining out of sight and hearing for the duration of the transmission, Galen wondered what would follow now. He doubted the Emperor wanted him around for the questioning of Calrissian. No, he thought it more likely that he would be sent to find and destroy the newly-surfaced Jedi Master, Kenobi. However, something in the back of his head told him that perhaps he would not be sent on such an assignment. If Vader learned of Kenobi´s survival, he´d surely want to lead the hunt himself, and if so, the risk would be great indeed for them to cross paths. Only time would reveal what secrets the future held though, so he settled down in a quiet and comfortable section of the ship, and fell into deep meditation.

On hearing the transmission punched in the coordinated to raltiir into his navi computer and made the jump. Wondering where the force would lead his path.
