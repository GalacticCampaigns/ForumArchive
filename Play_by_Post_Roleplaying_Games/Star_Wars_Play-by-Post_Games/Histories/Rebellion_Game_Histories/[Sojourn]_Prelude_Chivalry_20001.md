Six months aboard the Blood hawk is not so bad, boring if anything. Captain Torin Crow under the advice of his first mate Zet Mao hired you on as cabin boy, the ships maid. The pay is poor but the work is honest and the food is included. Most of the crew are good folk though lately the ships mood has been changing.
At first the runs where good, pick up cargo in port A drop it off in port B. Then the empire started stopping more and more traffic for random searches, a monumental task to uncover these rebel agents who have opposed them. Business began to slow down and to keep this ship going Captain Crow has been taken the Blood Hawk further and further for work.
The employers have become more and more questionable as well, and they are getting worse as the months go by. As Master Garet would say the force is with you, Captain Crow has not fired you yet the ship still needs a cleaner. SO you continue your work on this Wayfarer-class transport.
Working the back hallways you are passed by Zet, the tall lanky Twi`lek looks down at you and spits on the floor. The same floor you are cleaning. That one has never liked you. As you continue your duties you round the corner Zet passed, But no Zet.

â€œSix months and Iâ€™m still cleaning cabins.â€ Chase said softly under his breath. He looked up and down the hall way he was working in as he silently chastised himself for saying that out loud. The last thing he needed was for the first mate Zet to hear him say that. He might get the idea that Chase wasnâ€™t happy. *Thatâ€™s the last thing I need, him on my case, again.*  He said to himself careful of possible listening ears.
The last few months have been different. Jobs were becoming sparse and the ones the crew did take were quite questionable in legality. He had no problem with bending rules here and there which was good. In this business bending rules was part of your everyday existence. At least he still had a job but it didnâ€™t feel right. How long could he hide here with this ship? He could hear his former masters voice in his head *â€œBe grateful my young student you are still needed here. The Force is with you.â€* The memory of his now gone Master brought a smile to his face as he moved the mop back and forth across the hall.
He continued to work on cleaning the hall as he remembered a lesson from Master Garet. *"Chase, relax and let go of your feelings. Let the Force flow through you as you attempt to use it."*  The lesson of the day was to sense others in the rooms next to them, a simple task for the teacher, a difficult one for Chase. *"All living things are connected through the Force you and I, the plant in the corner and all the others in this establishment. A Jedi can sense things that canâ€™t be seen through the Force."* In the end he told his Master what he had sensed in the room next to him. Garet smiled at him and nodded. *"Well done Chase you have just taken a step into a larger world."* 
The sound of boot steps brought him back to the present. When the person rounded the corner Chase saw that it was Zet. As the Twiâ€™lek walked up he looked down upon Chase, as he happened to do most of the time, and spit on the floor as he passed.
Chase began a Jedi relaxation technique as the alien rounded the corner few feet away. A couple of years ago he would have taken issue with the man for something like that. That was then. Now he let it go. Garet would have been happy. Chase moved around the corner to see which way the first mate went. To his surprise Zet was no where to be found. *Where? How did he just disappear?*  He wondered.
Intrigued as to where Zet went Chase found a reason to practice. He began to focus as he clean near the corner.
With breathing and focus he attempted to feel for anyoneâ€™s presence in his vicinity to either side of the hall way Zet went down. He wasnâ€™t sure he could do it. Just then another lesson came back to him as Garetâ€™s voice sounded in his head. *"There is no try Chase. Do or do not."*
Chase reached out with his senses.
OOC: Tru I know I dont have UtF yet but you mentioned rp'ing out stuff like that for next level so I did.

You continue your duties, your connection to the force has made the time pass much more smoothly. Your progress has taken you through the back hall and into the cargo hold. Much emptier then normal you have high doubts that this run will even come close to even on the ships books.
The hold itself over half empty makes cleaning a little easier. So lost in your limited focus in the force that you almost missed Rasen. The short furry Bimm? You think that`s what they are called, the first of his race you have ever heard of.
Rasen waves at you as he passes by you. He checks a few consoles then exits continuing along his routine. Friendly that one but very skittish and not one for conversations.
Alone in the hold again you are left to your duties, to your thoughts, to your focus one the force. Your thoughts drift back to Master Garet the lessons he taught you and the lessons you are sure he was trying to teach you.
"There is evil in this galaxy all around us. It takes on many forms, it has many reasons. Not always will you recognize it. Clouds your judgment it will." One of the last things he had ever said to you, why did he have to talk in riddles? Where all jedi like that?
Interrupting your focus Zet give you a shove. Again your focus has prevented you from seeing the present, something Master Garet has warned you of. Something you will have to work on.
"Hey this is it you should be done by now, this whole hold should be clean top to bottom." Zet is yelling at you with a finger in your face. "When I come back I want to be able to eat off these floors. Or should we look for another cabin BOY!"

Chase continued cleaning the hallway and finally made his way into the cargo hold. Time passed quickly as he cleaned and practiced the Jedi training techniques that he knew. His connection to the Force was continuing to grow as it was becoming easier to sense it.
Lost in focus he nearly missed Rasen. Chase had never heard of Rasenâ€™s race before but it didnâ€™t surprise him as there were many races he still hadnâ€™t heard of.
â€œHi Rasen.â€ Chase smiled and waved a hand. He didnâ€™t answer as normal. *At least I didnâ€™t scare him this time* He chuckled to himself as the Bimm left the cargo hold.
Alone again he continued his duties. Thoughts and memories came back to him. Another of Master Garetâ€™s lessons popped into his head. *There is evil in this galaxy all around us. It takes on many forms, it has many reasons. Not always will you recognize it. Clouds your judgment it will.* Fitting lesson it was as Zet shoved him back into the present. Chase stood tall and faced the first mate as Zet yelled, a finger inches from his face. He took a deep calming breath. Zet was beginning to get to him.
"When I come back I want to be able to eat off these floors. Or should we look for another cabin BOY!" Zet yelled.
Chase shook his head. â€œNo first mate Zet. But if you were to look, find you will not, a better worker.â€
He began to move to his cart of supplies.

You continue cleaning the hold. This also gives you the quite time needed to practice your focus within meditation. Around halfway done you spot a robed figure standing in the back hallway.
Wearing a simple brown robe, his or her (you can not tell) face is covered in shadow. Staring at the individual its hard to tell at first if you are still in meditation or if its real. You blink and shake your head clear in an attempt to regain some focus. The hallway is empty again the individual gone. You can not help but to feel some level of familiarity with the robed figure.

## Re: Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-10-29 12:52:26)

Zet left him alone to finish cleaning the hold. Which was fine by Chase. More often now the first mate seemed to come down on him. Maybe it was the state of the business, or lack of it, for the ship and crew. Either way it was getting worse. Chase knew he would not start a confrontation with Zet but if push came to shove he would stand up to the Twi'lek. *I just hope it doesn't come to that. I have a good thing here. I'm relatively safe here and no one asks any questions that I don't want to answer.* He thought.
He continued with the hold and his assigned task to clean it. It was a big hold. It would have been better if it had been full, there would have been less to clean. *Such is the way of things. Not everything can go my way.* He thought to himself as he began his focus. Time passed and as usual he lost track of time. Halfway finished he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. Lookin gin the direction of the back hallway he spotted something. A solitary figure stood there in simple brown robes. The persons face was unrecognizable since it was covered in shadow. He stared trying to make sure what he was seeing was real. *Am I really seeing this or am I still meditating?* The thought crossed his mind.
He looked away and shook his head trying to recapture his focus. When he looked back the hallway was again empty as before. "Great now I'm seeing things." He said as he stood up and walked towards the back hallway. Something was odd was the Force showing him something? The sense of familiarity with the robed figure that was or wasn't there was remarkable. As if he knew who it was.
Shaking his head again he went back to work. "I need to learn to keep my situational awareness while doing that." He said out loud remembering when Zet had just walked up on him a little while ago and surprised him. "I can't let that happen again." Chase said quietly as he went back to work. He was half done, it shouldn't take long to finish up the hold.

## Re: Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-30 09:51:30)

You finish cleaning the cargo hold more or less uninterrupted. Only the odd crew member coming through to check the hold or avoid work bothers your meditation practices. You begin to pack up your cart alone again within the ships hold.
â€œHelp me â€¦ â€œa voice but from where? So meek you barely register it. To low to determine gender, race, or age.
â€œHelpâ€¦ â€œ again you hear the voice. You have just been through the hold and know it is empty save the cargo. You begin to move around stopping to listen for the little cry of help. Stopping just before the back hall you hear it again. â€œHelp me â€¦â€¦â€ itâ€™s a little louder this time. Looking down the hall you can see a dim light. The light is on the floor near the end of the hall. There is nothing down there but bulkheads.

### **Yogi** (2008-10-30 12:35:17)

"Finally It's done" Chase said out loud glad to be finished. He was also thankful for not being interrupted much. Looking around he was satisfied with the cleanliness of the hold. Wiping his hands on the somewhat clean rag he held he walked back to his cleaning cart.
*"Help me…"* Chase stopped instantly at the sound of the voice. The can of cleaner he was about to place onto the cart held still in his hand inches from it. It was so soft he could not distinguish anything about it. He stood up and looked around the hold. *It's empty I must be hearing things.* He thought as he set the cleaner down. Getting ready to move the cart he heard it again.
*"Help…"* he looked around seeing the empty hold. *I know it's empty, I've just been through it. The only thing here is cargo.* He left the cart and walked towards the the containers that held the little bit of cargo in the hold. He focused on trying to hear the voice again. Not hearing anything he finally came to a stop near the back hallway.
*"Help me…"* Chase heard it again this time a little louder. He looked down the hall only to see a dim light on the floor where there should only be bulkheads.
"This is really strange." He said softly looking around to see if anyone was near. Before he realized it he was walking down the hall towards the light. He brought his focus to bear and tried to search out for anyone around. *I know I heard a voice but why down here?* He didn't know but something was going on.
OCC: Perception +8 and trying to sense any living thing in the area.

Reaching out with your feelings you can sense the crew onboard. They seem content most likely going about their daily routines. Your focus changes as you turn to searching for the little voice. You look down and the light that you saw earlier is gone. Disappointed you sense nothing but confusion beyond the bulkhead walls. You are reminded of another lesson from your master â€œMuch is the future in motion. Constantly changing the future is. Clouded it can seam.â€

## Re: Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-10-31 11:22:13)

Focusing Chase was able to sense the crew aboard. He was elated that he was actually able to do so. It meant he had been getting better at practicing that skill. They all seemed content. *That's good for me. Maybe I'll be finished for the day.* He walked down the hallway and his focus changed. When he arrived where he saw the light it was now gone. *Just like the robed figure earlier. What could the Force be trying to tell me? If only I has had more time to train with Master Garet I would not be in this situation.* He was a bit frustrated. There was so much to learn about his connection to the force and he had so little time with someone who had the ability and knowledge to train him. It was then he remembered another lesson from Master Garet. *â€œMuch is the future in motion. Constantly changing the future is. Clouded it can seam.â€* He smiled at the way Garet spoke in riddles at times. "Well it can't get much cloudier than it is now." He said out loud to himself.
Sighing he turned around and went back to the hold knowing that the Force would tell him in time what it wanted him to do.
He finished packing his cart and went off to out it away. After securing it he made his way to where the Captain would be. He arrived there quickly and upon seeing the Captain busy he waited till called in. A moment passed and with a wave he was called in. Chase stood straight, "Captain I am finished with the cleaning duty that was assigned to me. Will there be anything else?" He made an attempt to get a feel for the Captain. He reached out with his senses wondering if he would be able to sense anything this time.

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-31 12:02:01)

On the bridge Captain Torin Crow sits in his central chair with his chin resting in his hand. At the helm Zebo keg sits with his feet resting on the console. The Duros pilot has made it very clear how easy it is to run this ship. Everyone else must be on break or sleeping. Which reminds you of how late it is getting.
Captain Crow stirs as you address him â€œWhat? No Chase its late, head to bed. We will need your help unloading the hold. Big day in the morn we will meet our contacts and conclude this run.â€ The captain goes back to his half rest, through the ships portals you can see the stars streaking by through light speed.
The messhall is vacant everyone must be resting for the morn. Not a bad idea you have been working all day. In your quarters Rasen your bunk mate sleeps soundly. Soon you find slumber as well.
Sometime later you are awakened by screaming. At first it is just noise. But as you clear your mind you can pick out multiple voices all screaming out. Your quarters are empty. You open the door to an empty corridor. The screaming persists, its coming from the hold.
Inside the hold you find it has been emptied. Inside the back hallway are several beings. Mostly aliens, they are faceless and crying out in horror.
Inside your quarters you awake with a start covered in sweat from the experience.

---

## Re: Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-10-31 13:23:25)

The bridge was practically empty. Only the Captain and Zebo the Duros pilot were at stations. *I guess Zebo wasn't joking at how easy it is to run the ship.* His question to the Captain was quickly answered. He nodded. "Thank you Captain, I'll see yo in the morning." He turn and left the bridge.
It was late, the emptiness of the messhall was evidence to the retaliative time on the ship. He walked straight away to his cabin where Rasen was already asleep. "Goodnight Rasen. Looks like we will have a busy day tomorrow." he whispered so he didn't disturb the sleeping Bimm. Within moments Chase closed his eyes and fell into a comfortable sleep.
Chase sat up instantly awake due to the screaming he heard. After a second of focus he could tell it was more than one voice. Looking for Rasen to see if he had heard it he saw that the quarters were empty. Hurrying to the door he opened it. "Stang what is going on?" he said loudly. Exiting into the deserted corridor he could tell that the screaming was coming from the hold and it sounded as if it was becoming worse as if they were scared and fearful of something. He broke into a run surprised that no one else on board could hear the loud screams. He found himself heading to the hold. The incidents from earlier make sense now. *Why didn't I hear them before!* he chastised himself for earlier.
Rounding the corner to the hold at a run he noticed it was empty. "What!" He yelled and ran to the hallway where he spied several beings. They were mostly aliens, faceless as they cried out in horror . "Who are y..." He began to yell.
He sat up instantly awake. He was still in his quarters covered in sweat from his dream. He laid back down on his bunk the dream still disturbing him. *What is going on?* He thought. Sleep did not come easily.
In the morning Chase cleaned up and was ready to start the day. The dream still playing itself over in his head.

## Re: Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-05 11:11:23)

Morning could not come sooner. The nightmares continue throughout the night, though less intense. Sleep did not come easy for you.
You awaken to Rasen shaking you. â€œHey â€¦ Chase wake up! You slept in. We are here time to unload the cargo.â€ Rasen notices your eyes open and decides thatâ€™s good enough for him. He heads out the door stopping only to say â€œHurry up I do not want to haul your load and mine.â€
You head for the hold still rubbing the sleep from your eyes. Day light shins from the hold and the noise of the crew working indicates that the ship has landed.
Everyone is currently hauling cargo crates off the ship. Zet glares at you but then continues a hushed conversation with the captain. Grabbing the last repulsor lift you begin your day. Outside the crates are neatly piled awaiting pickup.
You notice the landscape, a barren brown planet. Scattered hills dot the area and very little vegetation grows in the area. The air is warm and dry, with the sun blazing down on your backs.
Rasen begins to joke with you â€˜Ah welcome to Sarron home to no one.â€ Giggling he continues â€œTo your left you will notice the visitors center.â€
Zet pipes up long enough to shout out â€œBack to work!â€ Which ends Rasens joking.
The only other foreign feature other then the Bloodhawk is a large frigate. It must have just landed as the thrusters are still steaming from cool down and the ramp is closed. The ship is bristling with weapons even a few turbo laser cannons.

## Re: Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-11-05 12:21:06)

The rest of Chase's sleep was filled with vivid dreams or nightmares, take your pick. Either way it was not restful. He didn't remember any of the other dreams which was just as well.
If it hadn't been for Rasen he would have slept right through. With Rasen shaking him and the light urgency in his voice Chase opened his eyes. He lifted his head up only to see him leaving the door. â€œHurry up I do not want to haul your load and mine.â€ He heard as Rasen exited.
He laid his head back for a moment and then stared awake again. He'd fallen asleep again for a few minutes. "Stang!" He swore. "Zet will have my hide for this." He lifted his feet and set them on the floor. Remembering his dream he stood and headed for the cargo hold.
The daylight on his eyes makes him rub them. It had been awhile since he had last felt the sun on his face. *Too long.* He thought as he finally realizes that the ship has already landed. *Wake up Chase!* He yelled to himself as he caught the stare from Zet but the first mate was too busy in conversation with the Captain. Quickly he grabbed the last repulsor lift and began the day.
It was hot. Hot and boring. The landscape was plain and nothing of interest marked it. Chase figured it was just another backwater world on the butt of some Hutt.
Rasen saw him looking around and began his joking. "Ah welcome to Sarron home to no one.â€ He giggled. â€œTo your left you will notice the visitors center.â€
Jake smiled. "Yeah real busy they are. I wonder what the sights are?"
As he was about to add more Zet shut them up with a "Get back to work."
Chase exited the hold again with another load of crates. This time he noticed the other ship. A frigate by the size of it. Well armed too. *Interesting for a ship like that to be here on this forsaken piece of rock.* He relaxed and reached out to the ship with his senses in an attempt to gleam anything form it.
When he finished the exercise he found Rasen getting another load of crates. Chase moved up along side with his own lift. "Hey Rasen what's the other ship out there? Are they the buyers of the cargo?"

---

## Re: Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-06 14:00:37)

Rasen gives the frigate a sideways glance â€œYea they are our buyers. Though I have a bad feeling about this. Something is not right about meeting on an uninhabited planet.â€ Rasen pushes his empty lift up the ramp for another run.
Inside the hold Captain Crow calls you over. â€œChase there are some crates in the back hall, some of the crew missed. Could you grab them and bring them outside them and stack them with the other crates outside?â€
The back corridor is jammed with rectangular crates about one forth meter thick two meters long and one meter wide. The crates are dull grey in color but not metallic. The corridor is blocked with the crates they are stacked to the ceiling just outside the bulkheads in this section of the ship.

## Re: Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-11-06 16:35:29)

Chase shrugs at Rasen's statement. "Maybe. Maybe they are just trying to keep interested parties from finding out. Who knows. As long as they pay." He followed Rasen up the ramp for another load. He spotted the Captain waving him over. He nodded put his lift out of the way and went to see what he wanted.
â€œChase there are some crates in the back hall, some of the crew missed. Could you grab them and bring them outside them and stack them with the other crates outside?â€
He nodded. "Sure Captain. I'll get right on it." He made his way back to his lift and then made his way to the back corridor.
When he rounded the corner his jaw dropped. The crates blocked the entire corridor. Jammed tighter than a huts credit account. "Well isn't this great. No wonder the others missed them. It's a mess back here."
He brought the lift up near the stacked crates. They looked a bit odd upon closer inspection Chase noticed that were not metal and gray in color. "Odd I didn't notice this before." He ran his hand over the surface of the closest crate. "Maybe Rasen can give me a hand in a little bit?"
He began to load his lift with the cargo.

---

## Re: Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-10 10:37:34)

Alone the work is slow going. The awkward crates and the narrow corridor add to the task. When you pass Rasen you notice he is struggling with his own lift. With his diminutive stature he is forced to stop several times to acquire his destination. Even a few crates will completely block his view.
Most of the hold has been unloaded. You have just unloaded your first crate and you are heading back for your second. The lights on your lift begin to flicker on and off. Rasen must have missed the check on this one. Unfortunately all the other lifts are still being used, maybe one will free up shortly.
Outside the frigate has its ramp lowered. The captain is in negotiations with a heavy set Trandosian who seems very uninterested in most of the cargo. Two Trandosians stand watch one beside the merchant the other on a hill overseeing the whole operation. All including the merchant are armed with rifles.
Bringing the second crate around you line it up next to the first. Again the lights flicker. You will have to get Rasen over to run a diagnostic, this will free up his lift to you.
â€œBang!â€ the second crate crashes down as the lift fails completely. In a blur of motion the merchant and his guard have rifles aimed at you. The guard on the hill takes aim at the crew.
Zet flyâ€™s into a torrent of anger towards you, though you cannot make out what he is yelling.
The crate itself has cracked open. Inside you see a yellow and red light blinking. The contents inside look like nothing more then a solid grey slab of stone.

## Re:Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-11-10 12:49:10)

The task of moving the cargo was painful. Not in the physical sense but in that it was taking too long to get anything done. *Could they have packed them in here any tighter?* On his way out he saw Rasen having his own problems. *Doesn't look like I'll be getting any help from him for a while.*
With the first crate unloaded under the watchful eyes of the employer Jake shook his head. He wasn't expecting to see armed Trandosians. If half the rumors he had heard about them were true he was surprised that the Captain took their job. *Finding work has been tough though. while the trandos are bad company it is work.* He thought. Looking back at the crate Chase wondered just what was in it.
He was brought out of the inquisitive thought when the lift began to act up. "Great just what I need. As if moving this cargo wasn't hard enough." Continuing on he loaded up another crate. The lift seemed ok now. *Maybe it's just a short.*
Outside he brought the lift up next to the first crate and lined up. again the life began to act up. Looking around for Rasen he didn't see the little Bimm. "Maybe he can look at mine which will free up his for me." He said to no one on particular. Moving the lift in it quit. The loud bang it made probably could have been heard in both ships with the ramps up. Instantly all three Trandosians have weapons aimed at Chase. Zet is screaming in a language He doesn't understand. He backed away from the lift with his hands out to the side looking around. *Oh no!*
He looked at the crate that had cracked open from the fall. Two colored lights blinked on what looked like a slab of solid stone.
When Zet closed Chase looked at the first mate. He saw the fury on the Twi'lek's face. Chase this time stood his ground. It wasn't his fault. There was no way he was going to be punished for this. "The lift malfunctioned!" He made a gesture at it. "Look at it, it's malfunctioning!" He kept his eyes on Zet. The first mate had never struck him before but this time Chase wasn't so sure.
OOC: Chase will be prepared just in case Zet decides to knock him one. He wont hit him back but try to deflect the blow if possible.

## Re:Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-11 11:13:17)

In the commotion Rasen runs over to the lift. The little Bimm begins to check over the crate pulling it open to ensure the contents are secure. The Captain tryâ€™s to calm the situation. He raises his hands and slowly talks to the Trandosian merchant. â€œEverything thing is fine â€¦.. your merchandise is safe â€¦. There is no need to get rash.â€
Zet rushes over to the fallen crate shoving Rasen aside â€œEchuta!â€ Reaching his hands inside you can hear a series of clicks as Zet taps at a control panel inside.
Most of the crew have their hands in the air. Those that do not stand motionless holding cargo crates.
Rasen looks up to obviously upset. Tears form up within his little black eyes. Rasen stands and begins shouting at the Captain. An anger erupts from him you did not know existed within the shy little Bimm. In his rage about half his words revert to his native language, but enough of his words are clearly made out. â€œI did @#! %^& for this! 9*&^ dare #5^*9! 9*&^ could $%^ #$*( in slaves!â€ The little Bimm runs into the ships hold. The crew all look shocked.
Looking down at the crate you notice that Rasen had removed enough of the casing to look inside. The solid grey stone slab inside has a lighted control panel embedded into the side. The top of the slab is smooth except for the stone hand gripping the air in fear. A cold realization hits as you examine the crate and remember the number of other crates inside the back corridor.

## Re:Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-11-11 12:05:35)

Time seems to stand still Chase can hear the Captain talking to the Trandosian. Rasen huurried over to look at the fallen crate to see if all is in order. "Does the cargo look secure Rasen?" But Rasen wasn't able to able to answer as Zet shoved the little Bimm aside. Chase watched the first mate as he reached his hands inside. Clicks could be heard as Zet tapped the control panel.
*What's going on here. Why is Zet messing with their cargo. How would he even know what to do with it?* He looked around. Most of the crew was still either holding crates or hands in the air.
Looking to the Bimm Chase was surprised to see the anger on his face despite the tears in his eyes. His rage was expressed at the Captain. Many of the words he couldn't understand but enough were. Rasen ran back into the ship. Chase stood there shocked as did many of the others.
*Slaves. Apparently the rumors of the employers race weren't all untrue. They did deal in slaves.* Looking at the crate for a better look he saw all he needed to see. A small control panel blinked. The smooth surface was marked only with a hand gripping for something. Chase looked back at the ship and remembered the hallway and how many were left. It was then that his shock turned to anger. *Slavery…SLAVERY! We took part in slavery!* He shouted to himself. His anger surprised him and he remembered a lesson from Master Garet.
*"Calm yourself Chase, let go your anger. The Darkside it will lead you. Rule your emotions it can. Only calm, the right decission will you make."* The riddle and lesson forced him to control his breathing. He could feel the anger leaving him. It was going to take a bit to get it fully under control.
He looked back to Zet and the Captain, disdain evident in his voice. He had never spoken to either in this fashion before. "Did you know about this? If you did how could you willingly participate in slavery? How could you deal with this kind of scum ?" He stood there facing them hands balled into fists.
*Get a hold of yourself Chase.* He took a long calming breath.

## Re:Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-14 15:00:31)

Still in shock and in an almost hostage situation the crew merely stands and watches. The Captain turns away at your questions and looks to the ground. â€œI â€¦ I had no choice. I did not â€¦. want to.â€
The Trandosian merchant fires a shoot into the air. Shouting in broken basic the Trandosian orders â€œTss donâ€™t caress for yoursss drama. Unloadssss your ship nowssss!â€
Slowly the crew starts to move, reluctantly stacking the cargo. The Captain remains standing his back towards you his head down. Zet begins to shout orders of his own â€œCome on come on move it we have a job to do here!â€
From the hold Rasen emerges with a blaster pistol in both hands. The blaster recoils heavily as he fires. His shoot screams through the air hitting the Trandosian on the hill. The Trandosian falls and rolls out of sight down the other side of the hill.
Rasens surprise attack sets the remaining Transdosians off as they unleash a rain of fire on the little Bimm. Through the blaster shoots the little Bimm`s body collapses to the ramp floor.
Zet rushes your position, vibro blade in hand. He clearly intends you harm as he thrusts his blade in your direction. The blade harmlessly meets air as you easily side step the attack.

He questions cause the Captain to stop in his tracks. His head lowered as he turns away his gaze on the sandy surface. "I â€¦ I had no choice. I did not â€¦. want to." His voice was low and Chase barely heard him. Seeing and hearing the regret in the Captains voice most of the steam he had built up released. The practiced calming exercises took hold and he found himself calming down. *Who am I to judge? How many times have I had to do things that I didn't want to do? But still dealing with slavers…*
His head turned in the direction of the Trando merchant at the sound of its blaster fires into the air. "Tss donâ€™t caress for yoursss drama. Unloadssss your ship nowssss!" Emphasis was indicated with the leveling of his weapon in the direction of everyone.
He looked around still a little shocked about this situation. Chase knew that he was going to talk with the captain and his answer would decide weather he would stay on board or not. The others began to mill around resuming their tasks of unloading cargo. Looking at the Captain he saw that his head was still hung low. *what would have made him take a job like this? I never got that impression from him before.* He began to walk towards the man and crossed half the distance as Zet began barking orders. He looked at the first mate with an impassive face betraying no emotion. He was focused, calm. As in tune with the Force as he could be.
From the corner of his vision he saw Rasen emerge from the hold. Held in his hands a blaster pistol. It seemed too big for the little Bimm. The recoil brings Rasen's hands up high. His aim was true as the Trando on the hill fell over and rolled out of sight. "Rasen no!" Chase yelled. Too late. The return fire from the Trandosian's converge on the little Bimm and he fell hard to the unforgiving ramp floor.
Seeing his friend collapse Chase began to go to him but something told him to hold up. Odd as it was it seemed to be telling him danger was approaching. With a glance to his left he saw Zet advance on him. Vibro blabe his his hand. Training took over and he easily sidestepped the attack as he entered a combat stance.
Then a few things clicked. The captain saying he had no choice. Zet's operation of the control pad on the cargo. *How would he even know how to make sure that it was operation properly?* Was Zet in league with the Trandos? Was the Captain forced into this job? It didn't matter now not till this was over one way or another.
"Attacking a man from behind Zet. Somehow that doesn't surprise me. You've always been the sneaky, type hiding behind the power of your position as first mate. Now it's just you and me." He said calmly. If the Twi'lek was looking for any inclination of fear or anger he saw none. All he saw the the grim determination that Chase was going pound him.
Chase circled the blade wielding first mate. Training taught him to wait. The Force he knew would guide him. *"When needed Chase, guide you the Force will. Listen to it. It will guide your actions."* Fitting words of wisdom from his former master.
When he saw an opening he struck.

The clang of Rasens blaster can be heard as it bounces down the ramp. Many of the crew drop their cargo as the commotion begins. Some take up arms to defend themselves others jump for cover between the crates.
You return Zets swing with a backward thrust with your fist. Zet gracefully moves his upper body back. Your blow never comes close to landing.
The merchant yells out but in his native tounge you can not understand him. You can here the blasts of the trandosians rifles as they fire stun blasts at the crew. Two members fall as the weapons send energy through their bodies. Confused and betrayed many of the crew are helpless to find an answer.
Zet in his anger makes a two handed side swing. The blade goes wildly over your head as you duck in for an upward thrust of your own.
The crew shouts out to anyone at first then to the captain "What do we do, what the hell is happening here?"
Your upward thrust comes in much faster then the Twi`lek anticipated. Forced to jump back Zet grunts out loud as the action saved him from possible finishing blow.
Coming to his senses the Captain shouts out "Defend yourselves or be taken as slaves. Mert Jentren get those two crates into the ship. Prep for launch." You can here the Trandos firing on them as the Captain and crew rush them.

Chase circled Zet. The melee life and death melee has his total focus now. He could hear the crew yelling and the Captain telling them what to do but it was as if he wasn't there. Zet was his focus and would be till the fight was over. He remembered another lesson from Master Garet. *"Focus is all well and good Chase but do not let it consume you to the extent that it blocks out everything else."* It was a painful but lasting memory.
With the first exchange over and neither connecting the continued. Chase waiting for an attack saw the telegraphed strike Zet was making. The first mate over extended himself. He ducked and came in on the Twi'lek. He could hear the words of the Captain telling them to fight back. Moving quicker than Zet excepted Chase was able to land a glancing blow with his fist. It was only the Twi'lek's reflexes that prevented it from being a knockout hit.
Sounds of combat could now be heard around. From the rough language of the slavers to the crew rushing them. Chase drew his stun baton and twirled twirled it with his hand. "Was this whole slavery run your idea Zet. How could any being condone slavery?" Not really expecting an answer he found an opening and attacked with the stun baton.

The Captain and crew close the distance on the Trandosians. Jumping over then in unarmed combat trying to even the odds against armed slavers. The Trandosians fire several more shots and you can here the zap as stun blasts hit more of your crew mates. The Captains yelling can be heard above it all "Quickly dammit before the call in for reinforcements!"
Zet circles your movements stalking your for an opening. His slender frame and agile stance give him a predatory look. Anger flares in his eyes at your questions "I would have sold you out cheap but now I think you would make better mulch for this planet." Zet circles around spins and follows through with a back swing with his blade. The blade strikes out forcing you to hoop backwards. The blow would have opened you up had it not been for your quick reaction, though he did take a cut into your shirt.
Continuing you dance you manage to return his swing but Zets previous attack had thrown off your balance and your thrust only meets with air. Zet laughs at your clumsy attack.
The Captain and crew continue their assault on the slavers. The Captain manages to force the merchants weapon away from him. While two others try to pin the rather large guard.
The guard clubs a crewman with the butt of his gun you can hear the smack as he connects with the mans jaw. The merchant begins to yell out in his native tougne. The Captain yells back "Move people move! There will be more soon."
Still circling you now with a satisfied grin on his face Zet boasts out "Cabin boy ... oh cabin boy. You should run or stand and make this easy for me. I am going to enjoy spilling out your innards cabin boy!" Zet makes a rush forward thrust but slips on the ground forcing his blow far to the side. Regaining his composure Zet steadies himself for the next attack.

The personal combat between Zet and Chase was heating up. Both had managed to land blows but neither was decisive in ending the conflict. The two combatants circled. Their quick footsteps made small dust clouds that were caught by the wind and swept away.
He could hear the yells of the Merchant and the Captains rally to hurry. Chase never took his eyes off of Zet. the Twi'lek wore a grin on his face that could make most shudder with uneasiness. His words were made in an attempt to draw Chase out to make a foolish move.
"Cabin boy ... oh cabin boy. You should run or stand and make this easy for me. I am going to enjoy spilling out your innards cabin boy!"
Chase grinned back. "Why would I want to make things easy for you? Maybe this will be my way of taking your place on the ship." Chase lied as all he wants is to find someplace safe.
Zet sneered as he lunged forward his thrust going wide.
Chase watched as Zet regained his footing from his slip. Seeing an opening he struck with his stun baton.

Zet laughs as you taunt him. â€œYouâ€™re a fool like everyone else on board. Soon I will collect and you will all be slaves the Bloodhawk will be mine!â€ In his boasting he has left himself open. Training mixed with reflexes allow you to strike quickly. You regain your footing and spring up into an uppercut blow connecting the baton with Zets lower jaw
With ever ounce of strength you can muster your blow lifts Zet off his feet. The electric ping of the stun pulse chimes and Zets crashes motionless to the ground.
The captain unloads a series of shots into the merchant and his guard. â€œRun to the ship! Go go go â€¦. Thatâ€™s an order!â€
You can see that the cryo slaves have been loaded onto the ramp. The guard and merchant are down, shots from more trandosians come in from the direction of their ships ramp. Several more Trandosians are racing down their ships ramp blasters blazing. (No one has been hit yet). The remaining crew are on or running to the ramp some dragging fellow crew members.

Zet laughed at Chase's words. "Youâ€™re a fool like everyone else on board. Soon I will collect and you will all be slaves the Bloodhawk will be mine!" His bravado would prove to be his downfall. Chase saw an opening. Training and instinct took over and he struck quickly. the upward blow connected with Zet's lower jaw. A subdued "pufft" from the baton releasing a charge proved to be too much as Zet left his feat and fell on his back unconscious.
The speed of time seemed to go back to normal for Chase. His fight for imminent survival was over. Looking around he took in the situation. the Captain was calling for a retreat. *Good idea. Too many of them to tangle with. We have to blast off this rock and make a run for it.* the thought ran through his head. He looked back at Zet. The dust could his body made from impacting the ground was slowly drifting off. "So long First Mate. Maybe your dreams of slavery will come true. Though maybe not in the way you thought it would."
"Lets go. Move, move!" He yelled as he ran towards a crew member who was helping another and took the man's other arm. Together the two of them made quicker time. When they reached the ramp Chase saw Rasen's blaster that had fallen down the ramp.
He looked at the two he was with. "Go get inside get the ship ready to go and be quick about it unless you want to spend the rest of your lives as slaves or worse" The urgency in his voice was clear.
He went and retrieved Rasen's blaster and then went to Rasen. With one hand he dragged his little friend to the top of the ramp.
As others boarded he gave quick words to get the ship going. He went halfway down the ramp to see how the Captain was doing. Seeing the Captain running for his life he raised the borrowed blaster and fired at the slavers. he had some cover here on the boarding ramp which was more than the Captain had out in the open.
"Let's go Captain!" His blaster provided cover.

## Re:Chivalry

As you head for Rasen another hail of blaster bolts fly by. Your shot goes wild and hits their ship adding to the numerous carbon scores along her hull. The captain takes a knee and begins firing on the slavers. â€œGo now! Get out of here you fool, save the crew sell the ship and split the funds.â€ The captain continues firing above the noise you can barley hear him say â€œItâ€™s the least I can do.â€
You can hear the Bloodhawk begin a cold start. The engine grumble to life and the thrusters fire creating gusts of wind and dust.
Reaching down to Rasen you can feel his life force slipping away. You can almost see it like a soft pulsating glow that is diminishing with each beat. Sputtering Rasen struggles with his words. â€œGo â€¦ do my friend. Take this to â€¦.. my wife on Tat â€¦.. Tatooine. Mos Es â€¦. Find her â€¦ find Dosenna. Give this to â€¦. Her â€¦. It will take care of â€¦ them â€¦. You â€¦ thank â€¦. My friend.â€
You can see that it is too late for him now. Slowly his life force fades everything around you slows as you experience this moment. With his last ounce of strength Rosen manages to put a small box into your hand before he fades completely.

## Re:Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-12-01 13:08:59)

Chase ran all out for the ship. As blaster bolt flew by he ducked a bit and ran even faster. *We have to get out of here. The Captain better get a move on.* He thought as he fired behind him in an attempt to keep the slavers heads down.
He reached Rasen and bent down next to the fallen Bimm. He looked back to where the Captain had taken a knee and was firing on the Trandos that were exiting the ship. Chase could hear him yell to him. "Go now! Get out of here you fool, save the crew sell the ship and split the funds." With the rifle on auto-fire he could barely hear him. "Itâ€™s the least I can do."
The ship rumbles and shook as the engines were put through a cold start. The thrusters were kicking up large amounts of dust that blew by.
Chase looked back to who was probably his only friend on the ship. As he placed his hand on Rasen's chest he could feel the little bimm's life force slipping away. As if his beating heart pulsed within the Force and grew weaker as each second passed.
Sadness took hold. As he watched. He got himself moving. "Come on Ras. Lets get you to the sick bay." He was stopped short as Rasen struggled to speak.
"Go â€¦ do my friend. Take this to â€¦.. my wife on Tat â€¦.. Tatooine. Mos Es â€¦. Find her â€¦ find Dosenna. Give this to â€¦. Her â€¦. It will take care of â€¦ them â€¦. You â€¦ thank â€¦. My friend."
Through his connection to the Force he can see that nothing can be done to save him. His life force fades and time seems to slow as it happens. Watching chase is surprised to feel a small box placed into his hand as Rasen's life fades into oblivion.
"I'm sorry Ras. I'll get it to her. I swear my life on it."
The sounds of battle outside remind him of the situation they are in. He grabbed Rasen under the arm and hauled him up the ramp far enough so that he would not fall back out. Seeing another crew member near the controls he yelled to him. "Close the ramp now! We have to get out of here. The captain is holding them at bay but he won't last long."
As the ramp closed and Rasen was inside the ramp bay chase left him down and then ran for the bridge tucking the small box on one of the oversized cargo pouches in his pants and then butting it down. Coming to a sliding stop inside he saw crew at their stations. "Lets get going. The Captain is holding them off. Giving his life so that we can escape. Lets not have his sacrifice be in vain." He felt the ship lurch into the air on its way for space.
He looked around and sought his focus the calm place he could reach out and use the Force. He had only done this once before. A lesson from Master Garet came to mind. "*Talk to others through the Force you can. Hear your thought they will."* He sought out the Captain within the Force. Hoping he had it right he let his thoughts go to the Man that was giving his life for them. *We're on our way Captian. Thank you, may the Force be with you.* He hoped that his thoughts were received.
Chase walked to the navigator. "Plot a quick micro jump out of here. and then set coordinates for Tatooine. We don't want them following us." Seeing the navigator begin the calculations Chase relaxed a bit. "We're not out of this yet. But when we are the Captain wanted us to sell the ship and split the funds. After all this the ship will be marked and sought after. I want nothing to do with it anymore."
He reached down to the pocket that held Rasen's box. *Besides I have promise to keep to a friend.*
OOC: When and or if they do escape Chase will ask for ideas on how to help get the slave cargo out of their prisons. It may not be a good idea but he would not want them to be in there any longer than they had to. Does the ship have enough space and food for them?

## Re:Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-03 10:30:25)

The near-human at the helm nods and begins to tap the controls. Orus Lylon you think is his name. The crews looks worried and has no intention of becoming slaves and are already working to get off the planet. The ships engines rumble and groan at the pressure of a cold start.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On the ground Captain Torin Crow struggles against mounting odds. From the slave ships ramp a pile of dead slavers has formed but several others have managed to flank his position. Several shots hit the captain forcing him to the ground.
Looking up the Captain smiles, as he watches the Bloodyhawk disappear into the cloud cover. A flash of light from a slavers rifle brings only darkness to the captain.
Groggily Zet forces himself to his feet and waves to the slavers. â€œAh my friends.â€ His smile is quickly replaced by a frown when one of the slavers raises a weapon towards the former first mate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Entering space Orus points to the sensors, which indicate the slaver ship is powering up. Slamming the ship into hyperspace Orus forces the ship into a short jump. As the stars stream by the crew the crew breaths a sigh of relief.
After a quick recalculation the ship is underway toward Tatooine. Unsure of the next course of action the crews mood is somber. You can even feel it as a slight frigid aura. The ships rations would never extend far beyond the crews needs for the journey. Looking at the cryo-cargo containers the controls are simple enough and could easily be unlocked.

## Re:Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-12-03 17:12:43)

The stars elongated for a second time and now they were on their way to Tatooine. Chase could feel the sense of relief from the crew as they put light years between them and the slavers. Unaccustomed to being on the bridge he looked around. the sense of relief that he felt was beginning to turn into something else. *They don't know what to do. This may be the first time that they have not had either Zet or the Captain on board to direct them.*
Chase knew how they felt. He felt the same way when Garet was killed. The man, his former master, had taught him a lot about himself. That even though he was on his own he had the tools and knowledge to get by. as did the crew of the *Bloodhawk.*
He walked over to Orus. At least Chase thought that was his name. "How long till we reach Tatooine?"
The near-human looked to his left at Chase. "Two, three days at least. But what are we going to do when we get there?"
He looked around at the others. All eyes were on him. *Why look at me I don't have the answers?* He thought. He shrugged. "I'dont know but I know that I am through being a member of this crew. The last words the Captain said to me as he held the Trandos at bay was for us to sell the ship and split the credits between the crew. which is probably a good idea and the Slavers and any other of their kind will be looking for it. Staying with the *Bloodhawk* might be a death sentence."
He sighed. "But that should be decided upon by us all as it affects all of us. On another subject we have a hold full of people who were about to become slaves. What do we do about them?"
No one said anything till Jensen the systems operator spoke up. "Should we do anything? Are they our responsibility?"
Chase looked at the man. *He has a point. We can't support all of them there isn't enough food to feed them all. but we can't just leave them like that. I would not want to be left like that.*
He leaned against the bulkhead. "They're someones responsibility. And if we sell the ship they cant stay on board. Not to mention if we're caught with them on board." He saw the last words sink in. Get caught slaving and the spice mines of Kessel might become your new home.
"Ok so what do we do?" Jensen said looking around in an attempt that an answer might just appear out of no where.
"Maybe we should open up one or two of the containers and talk with the persons inside. Maybe we can find out some answers and come up with a plan." Chase said. "We are down several crew," Chase saw a couple of heads hang when he said the words. "We would have enough room and food for that many at least."
Orus was nodding in agreement. "Why not. Things can't be much worse."
"Ok then." Chase said. "Grab a medkit and the best person at treating people and lets go."
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chase entered the Cargo hold and saw all of the Cryo containers and the sadness of what they represented hit him again.
He looked them over. "The question is which one?" He didn't know. It was then that the familiar voice in the back of his head spoke to him. *Guide you the Force can. All you have to do is let it.* Chase smiled as saw Orus walk towards a crate. "Hold on a second."
He walked to the stacked crates and let his hand run across them as he walked by. He fought to get focused. It wasn't easy. It took him several passes to find it. He attempted to let the Force guide him to the best one that would help them out.
OOC:
Chase will try to let the Force guide him to the best crate. I know that he doesn't have UtF yet but I'm trying to rp it out that he workning on bettering his training.
Tru I also know that I took some liberty with crew and their actions. I hope that was ok. I was trying to figure out how to get form one point to another. Like I said I hope it's ok, I figure it wasn't anything game impacting. Just trying to create some dialogue amongst the crew.

## Re:Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2008-12-05 11:47:44)

Your question of which to open is meet by shrugs from the crew. Walking throughout the hold you have passed by each and every cryo-pod. Running your hand over everyone of them.
Another of your masters lessons comes to mind. â€œthe force guides you when you are calm at peace, focused. Chase you must clear your emotions to see what is already there.â€
Jensen paces â€œHow are we to determine which to open? What if they are sick or injured?â€
Oorus wrinkles his nose at that â€œHey man I donâ€™t want to leave them in there but what if they are sick.â€
Sensing nothing from the crates and no guidance from the force you find yourself missing your masterâ€™s lessons. Slightly frustrated with your own lack of knowledge in the force, you have choices to make. Jensen and Oorus both watch you looking for answers.

## Re:Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-12-05 12:24:25)

Chase walked back and forth. Fighting to find the calm and inner peace that he needs to reach for the guidance that might come from the Force. *Come on focus. You know what Garet would say to you. Yes you do. "The force guides you when you are calm at peace, focused. Chase you must clear your emotions to see what is already there."*
He was trying hard to do so but what if he made the wrong choice. He could see Jensen now pacing as he and Oorus traded questions. *Wrong choice or not we need to open one of them*
He came to a stop near the other two. Frustrated with his lack of ability in the Force. When he looked Jensen and Oorus he could see the questions upon their faces.
He shook his head trying to keep his own confusion and uncertainty hidden as well as he could. His eyes fell on to the crate that had fallen and broken open. The one that clued them into what had been going on and placed them in their current situation. He pointed to it.
"How about that one? If it wasn't for that one falling and opening up we would not be here." *Maybe that's the clue I have been looking for? Then again I have no better ideas.* He thought
He looked to the other two. Oorus shrugged and Jensen nodded. "Sure makes sense in a convoluted way." The systems operator said as he hoisted the medkit.
Oorus added in again. "I just hope that they aren't sick." he wrinkled his nose again.
Chase hid a small smile at Oorus's fear of them being sick.
"I don't think so." Chase quickly added. "Not that I would know but I don't think anyone would want to buy sick slaves. We should be ok." He added in for reassurance.
He went to grab the tool that was used for opening crates and walked over to the busted crate and finished the job the fall had began. Finally getting it open and having access to the controls he saw that they were simple and entered the sequence to release the person from their forced cryo sleep. "May the Force be with us." Chase said softly.

Jensen nods in agreement â€œThat makes sense, I guess they wouldnâ€™t have use for sickly slaves.â€ Oorus merely nods his conformation.
The two watch as you open the crate. Inside the frozen visage of a human woman grasping in horror at her last moment before imprisonment. Tapping the control panel the pods internal heaters ignite setting off a soft yellow glow around the woman.
Jensen and Oorus both give you side ways looks. Unfamiliar with the phrase â€œmay the force be with you.â€ It only reminds you of how different others can be. Master Garet had always said that the force flows though us all but our understanding of that would vary. The two stand silently as the pod releases its prisoner.
With a deep gasp the woman intakes air as if for the first time. Shivering the woman lets out a scream and flails her arms wildly trying to fend off some unknown assailant.
Jensen and Oorus unsure of what to do back off a few steps. Its obvious by the way her eyes are closed so tightly that she has not regained her vision. So the former slave woman blindly lashes out.

## Re:Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2008-12-11 16:53:30)

Any reservations he had about awakening this woman were going to have to wait as he hit the last number on the control panel. His almost silent request for the Force to be with them was noticed and Chase saw Jensen and Oorus give him odd looks. He didn't care. Let them know he was different. That he followed the way of the lost and almost forgotten Jedi Order. Only with the help of the Force could the Galaxy ever hope of throwing off the shackles of the Empire and it's Emperor.
The soft yellow grew and Chase looked back at the woman. *I wonder how she got into this situation and how she will react when she comes out?*
A deep sudden gasp the woman takes a breath of air, sweet life giving air. Her body was then wracked with intense shivers followed my a scream filled with fear. Which is evidence as she flails her arms in an attempt to fend off something.
Chase as well as the other two notice that her eyes are closed tightly. Chase notices that Jensen and Oorus back up a few steps unsure of themselves. It was then with his attention off the woman that he was hit across the face by the woman. Knocked to the side a little bit Chase righted himself and attempted to get the woman's arms under control so he wasn't hit again. He attempted to try and calm her.
Oorus looked worried. "Hey do you think she's ok? She looks sick."
"Shhh. It's ok. You're out. You're no longer imprisoned. Shhh. Calm down I won't hurt you. No one will now."
He looked over at Jensen. "Bring over the Medkit." He looked at Oorus. "Go get a blanket or anything that can help warm her up and hurry." He sent Oorus as chase could tell that the man was nervous.
He went back to talking to her and finally got her into a hold so that she could not hurt herself or anyone else. "Shhh it's ok. You're out now. My name is Chase. I've released you from whatever you were in. It's ok. I wont let anyone hurt you." He kept talking trying to calm her down. When she finally did subside.
He looked at Jensen who was beside him. "Got anything in there for her that might help?"
He went back to talking to the woman with reassuring words and tones.

Still struggling the woman slows at the mention of aid. She stops lashing out but remains frightened. She shivers and begins to sob. "What do you want with me. I have nothing to offer."
Jensen throws a blanket over her. She is startled at first but calms down a little more with your soothing words. Oorus standing there watching the whole thing "Umm I guess I could get her some food. be right back."
The woman continues to struggle still unable to see. Reaching feeling around with her hands she tugs the blanket close. "I can not see what has happened to me?"

Clearly in distress the woman is scared but then again who wouldn't be after what she had gone through. "You'll be ok." Chase said to her as she seemed to calm down a bit.
Shivering from she managed to ask a question though her sobbing. "What do you want from me? I have nothing to offer."
Saddened Chase rubbed her back. *What was it that happened to her that forced her to end up here?*
"There is nothing we want from you. You were going to be traded to some Trando's as slaves. When we found out what was going on we resisted and got you and the others who were imprisoned like you off the planet and ran." Jensen had retrieved a blanket and threw it over her. she was startled by the action. "It's ok it's just a blanket to help you warm up." His words seemed to calm he a bit. Oorus dismissed himself as he went to grab some food.
She tugged the blanket close in an attempt to protect herself. "I can not see what has happened to me."
Chase sat next to her ready to catch her if her strength should fail. "You were just released from some sort of Cryo sleep. I'm not sure what it really is." He said looking at her former prison. Somehow your body was placed in a stasis and kept regulated. Other than that I don't know. AS for you being awake right now. We did not know what to do with all of you. So I thought that reviving one of you to find out some information might help us figure out what to do with you and the others."
He stopped for a few seconds before going on letting what he said sink in. "What do you remember from before now?"

Shivering and still sobbing a little the woman struggles with the cargo bay lights. â€œItâ€™s so bright in here.â€ Using the blanket to shield her eyes she is able to find some comfort. â€œMy name is calla I am from a farming planet in the outer rim called Danboolia.â€ Tears run down her checks as she relives the moment. â€œPirates came out of the sky, they â€¦. They took everyone. I tried to run tried to hide but they where everywhere. It all happened so fast and now its all gone.â€
Oorus returns with a steaming mug. â€œIt not much just some ration stew but it should warm you up some.â€ Oorus begins to pass Calla the mug then thinks twice about it. â€œAH here Chase you better giver her the mug.â€

Jake listened as the woman talked and noticed how she used the blanket to protect her eyes. *What has she been through? It's hard to believe that slavery still goes on. I always heard the rumors but never really believed.* 
He words were shaky. â€œMy name is calla I am from a farming planet in the outer rim called Danboolia.â€ He noticed the tears that ran down her cheeks. â€œPirates came out of the sky, they â€¦. They took everyone. I tried to run tried to hide but they where everywhere. It all happened so fast and now its all gone.â€
Jake nodded his head. Through the Force he could almost see the sorrow that emulated from her "When did this happen and what about the others? Are the rest of them also from Danboolia? We might be able to take you all back."
Oorus returned with a mug of ration stew. He passed it to Chase with the suggestion that he give it to her. Nodding he reached out and took the offered mug. "Here Calla it's some food. It's not much but it will warm you up." He placed the mug in her hands. "When you finish we'll get you to our medical bay. It isn't much but we should be able to check you out better than here in the cargo hold"

Calla try`s to make sense out of all your questions then shakes her head and lifts the cup. Unable to see you reach out again this time to guide the cup so she can drink. "Than ... thank you." She takes another drink and slowly regains her warmth.
"I am not sure who the others are. How many are here? I do not even know how long I was .... taken. The last time I remember anytime of Danboolia was just before harvest season, Danbon month year 34." Calla puts her head down and begins to sob again "I wish I could be of more help. I am only a farmer ... I have lost ... everything why?"
After some time you are able to bring her to the medical bay. She checks out fine and you are told her eye sight will return in time.
-Oorus "What are we to do? We can not feed the rest of them not in this ship."
-Jensen "We should free them all when we reach port try to give them a better start."

### **Yogi** (2009-01-14 10:57:56)

Jake was saddened as he watched Calla break down into tears.  There wasn't much they could do at the moment.  He sighed as he placed his hand on her shoulder. 
"Calla," he started.  "We'll figure something out.  I don't know what right now but I'll figure something out."  He patted her shoulder and stood.  When she had finished the food she was given the three of them got her to the med bay with out too much trouble. 
While "Doc" looked her over, Doc was the crewmate that just happened to have the most medical training aboard, the three of them stepped outside.  Oorus and Jensen both had something to say about the situation.  Jake nodded with each of them. 
He wasn't sure what to do.  Not knowing what to do wasn't like him.  *Maybe it's because so many other lives depends on what we decide to do with them.  Master Garet I wish you were here to help guide me.  I could really use it now.*  chase thought to himself.  Lost in the thought he looked back to Oorus and Jensen.
"We can't feed them all you're right about that Oorus.  And freeing them all at port sounds good at first but not when you really look at it.  First they will all be like Calla in there."  he pointed into the med bay.  "Blind as a baby mynok and not able to take care of themselves.  Letting them loose like that will either get them killed or back into the same situation they are in now.  Not to mention all the questions thay will come when the port is flooded with refugees." 
He leaned back against the wall.  Doc came out as he did that.  "She'll be ok in a little bit.  The blindness will go away in a few days to a week I think.  She's in good shape considering." 
Chase turned his head to look at Doc.  "Thanks make sure has what she needs.  If she's willing to talk see what else you can find out."  Doc nodded andwent back into the med bay. 
He looked back at his two shipmates.  "I just don't know.  But one thing I do know is that I'm done with this ship.  when we make port and do whatever we are going to do with these people I'm out.  If we sell the ship and split the payoff I'll do what I can with my cut to help as many as I can but I have a feeling that it won't be enough." 
"Maybe someone can help us?" Jensen adde. 
"Who would want to help us get rid of a bunch of people were going to be sold as slaves."  Oorus added back. 
Chase shook his head.  "I dont know."  He paused for a second.  "Remember the guy I came across back on Ord Mantell a while back.  The one who was looking for people to join up with him..."  Chase saw Oorus's facial expression.  "Yeah I know the rebel guy but the rebellion is really the only group who is opposing the Empire.  We all know that the Empire is only watching out for themselves and no one else and anyone else who isn't with them ends up on Kessel or worse."  He craned his neck and looked at the ceiling. 
Jensen cleared his throat.  "I don't know Chase, dealing with the Rebels can bing down some bad things.  We all know what happened to old Captain Jack when he and his crew started to run equipment for the rebels."
"Yeah I do but it can't hurt to talk with him. If the rebels can help get these people back home all the better.  Besides I need to do something else.  Something that will matter, maybe make a difference.  I'm not doing that here." 
The silence between the three lingered for a moment.  "I'm beat as I'm sure that the two of you are also.  Lets get some rest and then I'll try to make contact with the rebels."  The two of them nodded and they departed for the crew quarters. 
Arriving at his door he remembered that Rasen his bunkmate wasn't in there.  Anger rose and he quickly got it under control with a calming technique.  He entered and look around.  He took a seet on his bunk.  He grabbed his carry bag and reached in.  Digging deep he reacehed in and took out his lightsaber, the one given to him by Master Garet.  He then hid it in a large pocket where he normally kept his stun baton.  As they were about the same size it wouldn't draw much thought from others. 
"It's time to stop running Chase"  He said to himself.  He settled in and began a meditative tracne.  Maybe the Force could help direct him.  Maybe.

Your master had said that answers would come to those who knew where to look for them. He also said that patients would reveal the way. More lessons that where easier spoken then practiced. Your hours of quite meditation are interrupted by the doors chime.
Stretching out to answer the door you find â€œDocâ€ as the crew likes to call her. Called so mostly out of jest towards her cooking skills, or lack there of. Pooja Sinaa the ships medic and cook looks around the corridor nervously still wearing her apron.
Looking up at you with her large dark eyes the light green skinned Rodian begins â€œUmm â€¦ah sorry to bother you.â€ Usually quite itâ€™s unusual for the shy little woman to approach anyone on board. â€œI overheard your conversation with Jenson and Oorus before. She blushes slightly at the mention of the latter. â€œIt was not my place to say so but â€¦.The rebels would help us but I doubt they have the means to. What I mean to say is that it might be next to impossible to find any legitimate rebels.â€ Not use to giving her opinion Pooja speaks quickly while looking at the floor. â€œA hospital would be better equipped to handle our passengers. But I do not think you will find any on Tatooine.â€
Pooja steps back then spins fully around before finding her direction. â€œItâ€™s just a thought.â€ The ships Doc then starts down the corridor towards the kitchen. You wrinkle your nose at the smell of breakfast. Many of the other quarters are open and you can hear the chatter from much of the crew within the mess hall.

No answers came as Chase relaxed and meditated.  Lessons fomr his master came and went.  All were easier spoken than actually practiced.  The door chime brought him out of his meditative state. 
*No answers but I'm not surprised.  Nothing is ever that easy.  At least I'm rested now and have a clearer head about me.*  He thought to himself as he reached for the door. 
He was surprised to see Doc, the light green skined Rodian, standing there.  For as shy as she was she rarely spoke to anyone on board. 
Chase noticed her uneasiness and motioned for her to talk.  Doc didn't enter, instead she spoke from the doorway. "Umm â€¦ah sorry to bother you.  "I overheard your conversation with Jenson and Oorus."  Chase niticed she blushed a bit at Oorus's name.  He gave a slight smile.  "It was not my place to say so but â€¦.The rebels would help us but I doubt they have the means to. What I mean to say is that it might be next to impossible to find any legitimate rebels."  She paused but not being used to giving her opinion she quickly continues.  "A hospital would be better equipped to handle our passengers. But I do not think you will find any on Tatooine."  With a full spin before getting her bearings.  "Itâ€™s just a thought."  And with that she made her way down the corridor towards the kitchen. 
Chase sat back on his bunk.  Doc made sense.  Tatooine was their destination but the planet was unlikely to help their human cargo.  This meant staying with the ship longer.  Then again maybe not.  If there was another planet close by with the proper medical facilities they could go there. 
*That might work.  Maybe we cold also sell the ship there.  That would give me the credits I need to get to Tatooine and deliver the package to Dosenna.*   Chase thoguht of his friend Rasen.  The news of his death would likely hurt Dosenna but she needed to know how and where.  It was a promise he intended to keep.
-------------------------
Dressed and cleaned up Chase entered the kitchen.  The smell of cooked food and conversation penetrated the air.  A few nods were directed his way that were returned with a smile and a nod of his own.  Grabbing some food she made his was over to where Jensen, and a few others were sitting. 
"How is everyone?"  The response was middle of the road.  He ate a few bites as the others spoke. 
"I did some thinking last night and also had a suggestion made to me this morning.  Tatooine isn't really equiped to handle our cargo.  Meaning that there is no real medical facility.  Which I aggre would probably be the best thing for them all as they would unlikely turn them away."
Jensen spoke up. "So whats your idea Chase?"
Chase gave a hslf smile.  "Well I know that were are a day into Tatooine but are there any othere planets within a decent distance to us that would have the medical facilities to handle Calla and the others?"  He looked to the others sitting there with them.  "I have a bad feeling that if let them loose on Tatooine their fate could be just as bad if not worse than if we let the slavers take them." 
The look on his face was determined.  He wanted these people safe.  "I'm looking for suggestions I haven't been at this as long as some of you.  And the sum of your experiences are greater than mine.  Where else can we take them?  Somewhere out here in the outerrim or will he have to head coreward?  Maybe somewhere Midrim?  We know we need to help them it's just a matter of where."

The entire room halts to a brief hush as everyone turns to each other. The silence is short lived as the room quickly erupts into a series of personal choices.
-Hojal a rather large Ithorian loudly protests â€œNo! I say Roon. We go to Roon the drink is much cheaper.â€
-Tac the tiny Xexto blurts out â€œWhat no way there is much more shipping traffic on Kalous. Much easier for us to find work.â€
-Jensen laughs â€œTac Kalous is crawling with imperial customs patrols. We would be in security forever.â€
-Pooja pokes her head out of the kitchen just far enough to watch the mess hall.
-Oorus continues to shovel his breakfast into his mouth.
-Taza Skii a dark skinned Zabrak woman with a very short temper announces â€œWell I believe Jendorn is the way to go. You can just drop me off there.â€ Folding her arms over her chest she sits back down.
-Jensen finishes his blue juice â€œChase lets check the nav computer. Maybe something will strike us there.â€
After the bustle of morning breakfast you make your way to the cockpit. Jensen waves you over from the navigation station. â€œHey over here I have pulled up nav charts on the surrounding four sectors.â€ In front of you Jensen has a display screen ready. Star charts are listed through the tabs. The ships position and destination are also marked.

### **Yogi** (2009-01-23 15:05:15)

Nobody spoke after chase asked his question.  The silence was a over quickly as many voices began offering up opinions.  Chase looked at Jensen as the disorganized chaos continued.  He listened to them as they spoke.  Everyone wanted to go someplace different.  with no captain to give out orders the discipline, or what counted for it was rapidly slipping. 
Chase looked down at his tray.  The muddy brown "soup" looked even less appealing now.  smirking he pushed his tray away.  After it had died down Jensen had the best idea.  Meet up with him later to check the nav computer. 
Chase nodded.  "Good Idea.  I'll meet you there in a little bit." 
Taking care to remember all the suggestions chase left the mess hall and made his way to the cockpit.  Looking around he spots Jensen waving him over.  "Hey over here I have pulled up nav charts on the surrounding four sectors." 
He looked at the chart and the nearby planets.  They were close to the Corellian Run.  Which was good and bad.  Lots of planets but Imperial Navy.
"Ok," he said pointing at the map where a ship was blinking.  "Here we are right?" Chase saw Jensen's head nod.  "Ok looks like we're between Tatooine and Kalarba with several planets near by to choose from."  Chase looked them over.  "Lets see.  Ryloth, Falleen, Rodia, Kalarba.  I don't know much about any of those planets.  Is there anything we can pull up on any of those planets.?  Maybe our answer lies somewhere else."
OOC:  Chase and Jensen will try and find some info.  If chase can aid Jensen that would be great if not its a +3 to chase's roll

## Re: Chivalry

Within the cockpit the fracas of the crew diminishes. Space streams the view ports, thousands of tiny stars thousands of people and places. With Jensen`s Knowledge you go through the near by charts. Several planets with several more that meet the many needs of the crew. Hospital service for the â€œcargo,â€ shipping traffic to get lost within the possibility of future work, and transport to Tatooine. No small list to meet.
-Jensen â€œLook Naboo is not really that bad far off course. Donâ€™t look at me like that. What planet is not crawling with imperials these days.â€ Sometime has passed and it is obvious that Jensen is becoming frustrated as he randomly picks planets. â€œHow about Druckenwell. Its only a day away, populated and a former separatist world. The empire is there but the people have no love of them.â€
Druckenwell:
Entering orbit around Druckenwell your ship enters in with one of the many lines of visiting traffic. Ships of all makes and models teem throughout this area all congesting in an attempt for a speedy business transaction. Two star destroyers maintain patrol over the lines of waiting ships as do small wings of Tie fighters.
After several hours the Bloodhawk is given permission to land planet side. Traveling the pre-route flight path provided the surface is even more over crowded then the skies above. Flying into the overpopulated city speeders of all designs add to the local traffic. The ship touches down softly within the landing bay.
Everyone meets in the cargo bay Jensen speaks up â€œOk folks me and Oorus will look for a buyer. We need you prints on the ships manifest this will allow us to evenly split the sale of the ship.â€ The crew lines up and one by one give there signature. â€œWe should be back in a few hours, take that time to find work or book passage off world.â€
Jensen and Oorus leave the crew begin to disperse going in their own direction. You can not help but think this will be the last time you see many of them. Pooja approaches you â€œUmm â€¦ Chase. Wwould you help me with the â€¦. A the cargo? I have found a local hospital that is government funded. They should be able to help us.â€

**Aboard the *Bloodhawk***
Jake raised his eyebrow when Jensen mentioned Naboo.  "...Donâ€™t look at me like that. What planet is not crawling with imperials these days."  The navigator says with frustration. 
Chase smiles and holds up a hand.  "Hey you know what you're doing.  What does your gut say?"  Chase watched Jensen as the man fought within himself. 
He wasn't sure if it was Jensen's gut or frustration but his friend placed his finger on Druckenwell.   "How about Druckenwell. Its only a day away, populated and a former separatist world. The empire is there but the people have no love of them."  Jensen said. 
"No love for the Imps huh?  That will work.  Lets hope this goes off with out a hitch." 
With the decision made the *Bloodhawk* dropped out from hyperspace laid in new coordinates and headed for Druckenwell.  The quietness of the cockpit was noticeable.  They were on their way to sell the ship and part ways.  Part of him was happy but also saddened.  He's be away from this ship and on finally on his way to the rebellion but he would be leaving some friends behind.  People he had come to trust. 
He patted Jensen shoulder.  "Thanks Jensen." 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chase made his way to sickbay.  Inside Calla was resting quietly.  Seeing Pooja he slowly walks towards her.  "How is she?"  Chase looked back at the young woman.  Cleaned up she looked to be about his age.  He shook his head as he remembered her situation only days before.
"She'll be ok Chase.  They all will.  Druckenwell isn't a bad place.  I may be able to help in finding a place for them.  I'll now more once we arrive in system."   
A sense of relief came over him as he nodded.  "Thanks Pooja."  He turned and went to Calla.  "Calla."  He said softly.  He repeated her name again and her eyes opened. 
"Chase is that you?" She said quietly. 
"Yes I have some good news."  He took a breath.  "We're now headed for Druckenwell.  There's medical facilities there for you and the others.  I'll help you out as much as possible.  Maybe give you enough credits to get back home.  It's the least I can do." 
When she started to object he held her hand.  "At least think about it.  I have to go to make sure the others are ready to be offloaded."  He gave her hand a squeeze and left. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Druckenwell**
The spacelanes were busy.  Ships leaving and arriving at the planet.  The Imperial presence was noticed right off as two Star Destroyers and its accompanying Tie fighters were ever present. 
It took several hours for them to finally touch down planetside.  Chase was relieved to finally be on the ground.  "Well that's one thing going for us."  He said from the back of the cockpit.  Seeing the smiles from the others he saw that they felt the same way as they all made way to the cargo bay. 
Once there and assembled Jensen took over.  "Ok folks me and Oorus will look for a buyer. We need you prints on the ships manifest this will allow us to evenly split the sale of the ship."  One by one they all gave there signature.   "We should be back in a few hours, take that time to find work or book passage off world." 
Chase caught Jensen's attention.  "Stay safe you two.  See you both in a little bit."  Jensen nodded and Oorus gave a thumbs up as they turned and left. 
He stood there and watched them leave.  As he looked around he sighed.  *I wonder if I'll ever see any of them again?  It's a big galaxy but the Force can act in strange ways making people cross paths.*  Chase smiled as the lesson from Master Garet came to mind. 
Pooja approached and Chase turned to face her.  "Umm â€¦ Chase. Would you help me with the â€¦. A the cargo? I have found a local hospital that is government funded. They should be able to help us." 
The smile returned as this was good news.  "That's great Pooja.  I'd be happy to help.  Actually I would not have it any other way.  Where do we start and who do we contact?" 
He had the feeling that today would be a good day.

Pooja smiles â€œI have already contacted the local hospital. We are to meet Lau Na at the near by hospital. She has asked that we bring our passengers as is.â€ Pooja turns a slight shade of red when she notices the others listening in on your conversation.
As you talk to Pooja more of the crew departs waving their last farewells. The ship seems so empty now. Pooja helps with the passengers and Calla waits inside the hold. â€œI wish I could be of more help. I feel so useless.â€ Calla blinks repeatedly. â€œAT least now I can see a white blur not just blackness. Better then nothing I guess.â€
Outside a transport is waiting sent by the hospital. A large cargo speeder with a fixed blue droid pilot waits to be loaded. â€œI am D8-M here for your transportation needs. Please be careful while loading cargo and watch your step.â€ The droid is part of the plain white transport and is unable to help with the cargo.
Outside the cities streets are overcrowded. Streams of ships transports and speeders clog the airways. While pedestrians cram the sideways and lifts. No Coruscant Druckwell is as close to it as one could find this far away from the core worlds. Already several floors up the multi-level city stretches well out of eye sight. Lights and holo-advertisements pollute the cities buildings. The city also hums with a low constant roar of the entire mix. The odd stormtrooper patrol can be spotted in pairs here and there among the crowds.
Landing on one of the many platforms a small assembly greets you at the hospital. Several orderlies push lifts towards the transport and begin unloading. One tends to Calla escorting her inside for examination.
Dressed in white a tall Kaminoan steps towards you and Pooja. Her movements are fluidic and her voice low and soft. â€œWelcome to Druckenwell. I am Lau Na. Thank you so very much for the rescue of so many innocent peoples. There are many who would like to meet with you and your crew.â€
For the next several hours you and Pooja are given the royal treatment. Shuttled off to a nearby restaurant where various officials, business people, politicians, doctors and locals treat you to a heroes welcome. No reward is ever offered but for a few hours you are both well feed and entertained. A local establishment offers free room and board to the entire crew for the next few days.
Jensen finally contacts you some time later over the comm. â€œWe have found a buyer unfortunately we are not getting full price for the ship. I was wondering what you would like to do with your share. Where would you like it sent?â€

## Re: Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2009-01-30 16:10:08)

Chase gave Pooja a half grin as she mentions that the hospital has already been contacted.  He noticed that she spotted that others listening in on their conversation.  And a slight shade of crimson came across her cheeks.  *Interesting I didnâ€™t know that Rodians could blush like that.*  He thought.
He looked her straight in the face his expression was one of seriousness.   â€œPay no attention to what they think.  Someone once taught me that if you are doing something and you know it to be right, it matters not what others think.  Only that you know it is the right thing to do.â€     
She seemed to brighten and stand a bit straighter and Chase nodded.  â€œYou are an odd one Chase Davion I am glad to have met you.â€ 
Chase nodded.  â€œThe feelings are mutual Pooja.â€ He said with a genuine smile on his face as he took a breath.  â€œYou know I was ready to hide for the rest of my life and just let the galaxy go on in the direction it has been going.  What has happened the last few days has finally opened my eyes.  I canâ€™t stand by and watch it go by anymore.  I have to do something.â€  The looks she gave him was one of understanding.
---------
The crew was departing around them.  Farewell, waves and handshakes were traded.  Chase spotted Calla at the top of the ramp that lead down from the hold.  He walked over to her.  â€œWeâ€™re here Calla.  How are do holding up.?â€ 
She looked around and then to the direction of his face.  He could tell that she was still blind. She shrugged.  â€œI wish I could be of more help. I feel so useless.â€  She blinked repeatedly.  â€œAT least now I can see a white blur not just blackness. Better then nothing I guess.â€
He laid a hand on her shoulder.  â€œItâ€™s not much to look at.  If youâ€™ve been to one major port they all look the same after a while.â€  The sounds of the area seemed to dispute what he was saying.  Load lifters and people were all around doing their assigned duties. 
â€œWell the transport from the hospital is here.  Lets get you and the others loaded.  It shouldnâ€™t be far to the hospital.â€  Pooja helped Calla into the speeder.
Jake looked the speeder over, â€œLooks like weâ€™ll have to load it up ourselves.    He posted two other crew members and waved them over.  With a quick word and an agreement the three of them they loaded the cargo onto the speeder.  With everything strapped down and secure they were ready to go. 
Chase locked up the ship and made sure that it was secure.  With all of his belongings and the package for Rasenâ€™s wife he left the ship.  While the ship had some bad memories to go with it there were also some good things that came from being one of its crew.  One of those things was his new sense of direction.  He climbed aboard the speeder and they left heading for the hospital. 
The trip was fairly quick.  The busy airways reminded him of Corellia and brought back memories, some good, and some bad.  The three of them made small talk on the way.  Calla talked of her home and what she was planning.  Chase mentioned he was going to Tatooine to deliver the package that Rasen wanted him to deliver to his wife.  Pooja didnâ€™t get the chance to talk as they landed at the hospitals platform. 
Staff began to exit the hospital entrance pushing lifts and begin the process of unloading the cargo.  One of the orderlies took Calla and escorted her inside.  Case called out saying that heâ€™s see her before he left. 
With a warm reception from Lau Na and an invite the two are whisked off to meet all sorts of people.  They were being given a heroes welcome.  Many times Chase repeated the phrase.  â€œNo sir/madam we were just doing what we thought was right.  No heroics were involved.â€   He did not mention the fight with the slavers as it wasnâ€™t important.  What was important was that the people were tended to. 
Either was for several hours they were treated well.  Things looked even better when a local establishment offered free room and board for the whole crew.  Chase made sure to do the meet and greet.  After all contacts made here on Druckenwell might come into use in the future.  Some may even have ties to the Rebellion. 
-----------
A while later Chaseâ€™s comlink rings.   Answering he was pleased to hear Jensenâ€™s voice.  â€œWe have found a buyer unfortunately we are not getting full price for the ship. I was wondering what you would like to do with your share. Where would you like it sent?â€
â€œWell how about you meet us here at the Imperium hotel.  They have offered to put up the entire crew for a few days in thanks for the great deed we did.  I know sounds funny.   But you can transfer my share to my credit chip here.  Is there a share for Rasen?  Iâ€™m going to meet his wife on Tatooine and deliver the package he wanted her to get.â€ 
Chase finished his conversation with Jensen.  Happy that he was going to have some credits, enough to help calla out a bit and get to Tatooine to fulfill his promise to his friends wife.
He still had a few things to do tomorrow.  Get his and maybe rasen's share. Give some to Calla and get a ticket to Tatooine.  There wasn't really any reason to stay any longer.   
He sat down on the bed eased back and brought his feet up.  Its silk sheets were a rare treat.  Probably the first and last time Iâ€™ll ever get this kind of treatment.  He took a deep breath and began his Force exercises.  It was time to get serious and get to work on getting better. 
As he drifted off to sleep a realization came to him.  It was a good day after all.

Daylight comes quickly with the excitement of the previous night still running through your mind. You awake with a slender bronze maintenance droid cleaning your room. It wheels around and directs a series of beeps as you rise out of bed, the droid obviously has no vocabulator. A modest breakfast sits on a tray beside your bed. Local brown fruit surrounding a large purple egg makes for a tasty meal.
A knock on your door brings your friend Jensen. â€œMorning Chase, sorry to bother you so early.â€ Pooja stands behind Jensen, they both wait for an invitation before entering your room. â€œItâ€™s just us now most have found work. Oorus is already off world on a passenger liner.â€
Pooja looks around the room side stepping the droid who determines now is not the best time to clean. With another series of beeps the droid wheels out of the room. â€œI â€¦. Umm I will stay here on Drunkwell. Lau Na has offered me a position at the local hospital.â€ Pooja smiles it is a very good offer for her to take.
Jensen steals a bite of fruit off your plate, a common occurrence on board the Bloodhawk. â€œI have a job as first mate on a cargo hauler. I will be shipping out again soon. I have talked to captain Felan of the Port Bound, she has agreed to take you to Tatooine in exchange for labor.â€ Jensen bites into the fruit and continues with his mouth full. â€œThe crew agreed to share the profits with the survivors. This unfortunately means a much lesser share.â€ Jensen passes you a small box with your share. â€œI hope this will be enough, some of us added a little to it but your share is mixed with Rasens.â€
Pooja takes this opportunity to order more food. The three of you eat one last meal together. In this large galaxy it is well accepted that many may never meet again when they part ways. Jensen informs you on the docking bay and departure time for the Port Bound if you are to accept the offer for the free trip to Tatooine. He advises not to be late as Captain Felan will want to depart on time. This gives you only four more hours on Drunkwell.

He wanted to keep sleeping.  The bed was comfortable.  Probably the most comfortable one he had ever slept in.  The smoothness of the silk sheets begged him to stay.    Rolling over he groaned as he stretched his arms over his head. 
The slight whirring brought his eyes open quickly.  To his relief it was only the maintenance droid carrying out its duties.  It beeped at him as he rose out of the bed.  He figured that it must not have a vocabulator so it would not be able to disturb the guests. 
Turning his head towards the delicious smell he noticed the tray that was set out.  Despite the rather large meal he had the evening before he was hungry.  â€œWell that was certainly nice.  I better not get used to this kind of treatment.â€ He said to himself as he raised the glass of local juice to the cleaning droid in salute.  Not noticing the droid kept working. 
Taking off the rest of his clothes he headed for the fresher.  A few relaxing minutes in there and he would be a new man.  â€œI really need this.  I wonder what Master Garet would think about this turn of events.â€  He said to no one. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All cleaned up and ready to go find the others he was interrupted by someone knocking on the door.  Looking out the spyhole he sees Jensen.  He opened up the door and smiled.  Pooja was also with him. 
â€œJensen, Pooja come on in.â€  He stood aside to allow them to enter. 
â€œMorning Chase, sorry to bother you so early,â€ Jensen apologized as Pooja followed behind.  â€œItâ€™s just us now most have found work. Oorus is already off world on a passenger liner.â€
â€œGood I hope he finds something to do.  Please sit.â€  He gestured to the synthwood table where the remains of breakfast is on the tray. 
The droid finally noticing that there were now more people in the room finally wheeled itself out of the room.  Its beeps finally quieted as the door shut. 
Pooja broke the silence. â€œI â€¦. Umm I will stay here on Druckenwell. Lau Na has offered me a position at the local hospital.â€  The smile she wore was the biggest Chase had ever seen her face.  He could feel it in the Force as well.  For some reason he was able to feel it easily.  Maybe it was because he was calm and relaxed just like Master Garet had always told him. 
â€œPooja Iâ€™m happy for you.â€  He smiled.  â€œThatâ€™s good to know.  If Iâ€™m ever out this way Iâ€™ll make sure to look you up.â€
He was about to say something but Jensen swiped a piece of fruit of his plate.  A common occurrence aboard ship was one he was going to miss.  Jensen cleared his throat after swallowing. â€œI have a job as first mate on a cargo hauler. I will be shipping out again soon. I have talked to captain Felan of the Port Bound, she has agreed to take you to Tatooine in exchange for labor.â€
Chase nodded as that was a good deal.  Free passage in exchange for working during the trip was like old times on the *Bloodhawk*.   
Jensen took another bite and continued talking with his mouth full and handed Chase a small box.  â€œThe crew agreed to share the profits with the survivors. This unfortunately means a much lesser share. I hope this will be enough, some of us added a little to it but your share is mixed with Rasens.â€
Chase looked in the box and smiled and looked at the two across from him.  â€œIt will be more than enough.  What the crew did in sharing with the survivors is great.  To be honest I though a few might balk at the notion.â€ 
Jensen nodded.  â€œThey did but when the others started making the offer they came onboard pretty easily. â€œ 
Pooja ordered some more food.  The three of them talked for two hours.  Sharing stories of times past and what lies ahead.  They were a bit surprised when he talked about the rebellion and his intention to join them.  His reasoning was the events of the last week.  Granted they werenâ€™t the only reasons but he wasnâ€™t going to go into that with them here in the hotel room. 
He remembered the stories that Garet told him about the Jedi Order.  How it stood as guardians and protectors of the galaxy.  He was not a Jedi in any sense of the word.  Merely a beginning student but it was time to act and help those that stood against the Empire. 
The time passed and the conversation drifted.  The three of them looked at each other.  It seemed that they all realized that this may be the last time the may ever see each other.  Itâ€™s a commonality in this large galaxy.  When Friends part ways itâ€™s often for good. 
â€œListen you two.  Stay safe.  With the Empire out there things will always dangerous.â€  Pooja nodded, as did Jensen.   
â€œYou too Chase running with the rebels can be dangerous.  Iâ€™d try and talk you out of itâ€¦â€  Jensen saw the look in Chaseâ€™s eye.  â€œBut I know I would not succeed.   If anyone can be a thorn in someoneâ€™s side itâ€™s you.
Jensen looked at his Chrono.  â€œI got to be going.  I have a few things to take care of on the *Port Bound*.  Be at docking bay 498 East side.  Itâ€™s not far from where we put the *Bloodhawk* down.  The captain is leaving at 15:00 hours.  And he wonâ€™t wait. 
Nodding Chase answered.  â€œGot it 15:00 hours.  Iâ€™ll be there.â€  With a quick handshake Jensen turned and left the room. 
Pooja, not wanting to intrude, as she felt a bit uncomfortable being here alone also stood.  â€œI should go also Chase.  Thank you for everything.  If you re ever back here please stop in.  I would like to know how things are. â€œ 
Standing he gave her a small hug she was stiff at first but relaxed a bit.  â€œI will do that.â€  He said as she stood back and walked to the door opening it for her.  He watched her walk through the door.  Letting go of the handle the door slowly closed.  He wished it would go slower.  For he knew that when it was finally shut this part of his life would be over.  The friends he had made in the short time he was with them might just be gone forever. 
He took a deep breath.  He was calm, relaxed.  He could feel the two people on the other side of the wall in the room next to his.  They could tell that they were happy.  The feeling he got was of something new.  He smiled.  Like them he was off to something new. 
Looking at his own chrono he saw that he had 4 hours till the ship left.  He had some investigation to do.  He activated the roomâ€™s computer access and brought up the planet Tatooine.  Rasen had given him his wifeâ€™s name and a location.
â€œLets see Mos Es something, name of Dosenna.  There canâ€™t be that many matches.â€  For good measure he added Rasenâ€™s last name to the search.  â€œThereâ€™s only so many people on that planet.
The computer beeped a moment later a it had some info for him.  Weather it was useful or not time would tell when he got to Tatooine.  He still had more than three hours to kill.  He packed up his belongings and left the hotel.  Flagging down a taxi speeder he gave the droid driver directions to the docking bay.    â€œI might as well be early and start earning my keep for the trip.â€œ  With a jolt the taxi lifted off and joined the busy skyline.

## Re: Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-06 12:29:55)

The taxi zips in and out of traffic, cutting more then a few travelers off on route. Setting down near docking bay 498 the droid responds â€œNo charge sir, complements of the Imperium hotel. Enjoy your stay on Drunckwell.â€ The droid nods then zips away.
Inside the hanger bay waits a new YT-2400 with the markings The Port Bound. Looking over the ship it is in really good condition with only a few dings here and there. You see stacks of crates in front of the access ramp, you also see Jensen loading a hover cart. He stops to greet you â€œChase glad you made it.â€ Smiling he grabs you for a hug. â€œHow have you been buddy? Or should I say hero. Hey Captain Chase is here.â€
Now closer to the ship you can see sparks flying. Captain Felan stands up from the roof of the ship and waves. Dressed in various colors of yellows oranges and reds the woman stands out. Yelling down to you â€œHello there welcome to the Port Bound. She has a lot of character I have personally made several modifications myself. You can put me down but not my ship.â€ As she talks you can see her skin tone changes colors slightly but not out of emotion but rather her near human origins. â€œYou can stow your gear later for now we have food stuff and moisture vaporator parts bound for Tatooine.â€
The Captain goes back to her work while Jensen waves you over. â€œHey help me out here.â€ Several hours later the ship is in orbit running nav calculations for Tatooine. Jensen invites you to a few holo games â€œA little down time between ports. I am betting you can not beat me in a game or two.â€

### **Yogi** (2009-02-07 23:51:58)

More than once did Chase think he was going to die on the trip to *Port Bound*  Fortunately the Force was with him and the trip was short.  â€œGood I can get out now, how much?â€  He asked the droid driver.
â€œNo charge sir, complements of the Imperium hotel. Enjoy your stay on Drunckwell.â€ 
â€œThanks.â€  White knuckled he exited the taxi and pulled his bag out after him.  The bag had barely cleared the vehicle when it took off and Chase pulled on the bags strap to make sure it was clear.  â€œIâ€™ll never get used to droid drivers.â€  He muttered.  As he watch the taxi nearly collide with a cargo hauler as it merged back into traffic. 
Hoisting his bag onto his shoulder he turned and walked into the hanger bay.  As he came to a stop his foot scraped the ferocrete.  Before him was a YT-2400 one that was in pretty good shape.  Markings of the *Port Bound* on its hull furthered confirmed that he was in the right place.  Several dozen crates were stacked near the ships access ramp along with a hover cart that was operated by Jensen. 
He walked closer to the ship.  â€œHey Jensen Iâ€™m here.â€ 
His friend turned â€œChase glad you made it.â€ And then grabbed him into a hug.  â€œHow have you been buddy? Or should I say hero. Hey Captain Chase is here.â€
Chase smiled back and held up a hand.  â€œHey now you had just as much to so with that as I did.  And stop all that hero stuff.  It was the right thing to doâ€ He said as he clapped him on the back.   
Chase saw a woman stand up from the top of the YT.  Dressed in an outfit that would make her stand out anywhere she yelled down.  â€œHello there welcome to the *Port Bound*  She has a lot of character I have personally made several modifications myself. You can put me down but not my ship.â€
â€œYes Captain.â€  Chase answered falling back into a ships routine.  A smile crossed his face.  Being aboard ship wasnâ€™t a bad life.  Maybe when all this was over he might just get a ship and just fly the Galaxy.
He noticed her near human origins as her skin changed tones.  â€œYou can stow your gear later for now we have food stuff and moisture vaporator parts bound for Tatooine.â€
â€œSure thing Captain.  Jensen and I will have them loaded in no time.â€  He set his bag down near the access ramp and walked over to Jensen as he asked for some help. 
Grabbing a crate with Jensen Chase helped him lift it onto the hover cart.  As they set it down Chase rubbed his hands.  â€œJust like old times huh Chase.â€ 
â€œYes it is.â€ Chase smiled back.  â€œYes it is.  And you know what.  I think Iâ€™m going to miss it more than I thought.â€
Laughing the two of them grabbed another.   
Some hard work and several hours later that were in orbit around Druckenwell as nav calculations were being worked out.  With the calculations set the stars elongated and they were on their way.  Chase could feel the hyperdrive activate from his room.  With his gear safely stowed away he mad his way to the ships common area.  Jensen waved him over.  â€œA little down time between ports. I am betting you can not beat me in a game or two.â€  He said. 
Chase sat.  â€œIâ€™m betting your right.  Iâ€™ve see plenty on the *Bloodhawk* loose their fair share of credits to you.â€  He grinned.  â€œI guess putting up fifty credits wonâ€™t hurt me too much.  Besides if I do win Iâ€™ll throw it in with Rasenâ€™s share for his wife.â€

## Re: Chivalry

### **master_Tru** (2009-02-10 11:07:45)

You and Jensen spend much of the night playing various holo-games, though you only manage to break even. With so little to do on route you are happy to take turns in the cockpit watching over the auto-pilot. It is on one of your shifts that the Port Bound reaches Tatooine. The backwater planet is a far cry from Drunckwell. It sports a fair amount of traffic but no where near Drunckwells volume.
In high orbit above the desert planet an imperial star destroyer lays waste to a private liner. The transport is merely a shell now but the destroyer continues to fire its massive turbo lasers on the hulk of dura steel. Captain Felen mutters under her breath as she enters the cockpit â€œI hope that is just target practice. Take us in but stay clear of that in case they mistake my ship for more target practice.â€
Jensen enters in just after the captain â€œBy the stars â€¦â€¦ I hope there was no one on board.â€ Jensen lowers his head in thought.
Captain Felen takes the co-pilots seat and readies the shields â€œJensen take the cannon, Chase set course for the city of Bestine there is a moisture farm just outside city limits thatâ€™s our buyer.â€
Thankfully the star destroyer ignores your ship, without even a general hail. The ship is fairly easy to pilot and with the Captains help that much easier. You bring the ship down onto the desert floor just outside a fair size farm house. Moisture towers randomly dot the area and a few farm hands shield their faces as the engines stir up clouds of dust. The captain pats you on the back after a soft landing â€œGood job Chase! Help us unload I will bargain with the owner and try to get you a ride into town.â€
The farm hands stand waiting at the end of the ramp both eager to help unload the ship and converse with anyone from the outside world.
-A tall lanky human with dirty upkeep hair announces â€œHi I am Gant Varik! Where are you all from? What planets have you seen?â€
-The other a squat Sullustan with a badly burned scalp adds â€œWelcome to the sore spot of the galaxy. My name is Sallo. I hope you have news of the outside world, have you been to Sullest?â€
Captain Felen begins negotiations with the farm owner over the price of the cargo. She also points in your direction at one point. By the time the ships hold is unloaded the Captain and an aging human approach you. â€œChase meet Raddi Thane the local land owner. He has agreed to take you in until the next trip into Bestine.â€
The frail old man smiles â€œHello there Chase, so how is your working hands?â€

## Re: Chivalry

### **Yogi** (2009-02-10 17:14:58)

Chase and Jensen laughed into the night.  The various holo-games kept them up till the early morning hours.  It was nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything.  No slavers, no running just relaxing.  Some of the time was spent with Captain Felan.  The two of them relived some of the times aboard the *Bloodhawk* for the Captain.  Most of the times were good.  Some were bad.  How chase was treated by Zet the former Twiâ€™lek first mate of the *Bloodhawk* and the involvement of the slaves was foremost on their mind.  The battle with the slavers and Zetâ€™s downfall at Chaseâ€™s hands brought a smile to all of their faces. 
â€œI just hope he got what he deserved when he woke up.â€ Chase said to the other two.  â€œFate has a funny way of working both ways.â€  The three of them nodded and fell silent for a bit.   Soon after that they called it a night and prepared to go off to quarters.   
It was decided that they would take shifts in the cockpit watching the auto-pilot.  â€œSure Iâ€™d be happy to.  Iâ€™m not much of a pilot but I can sure sit and watch.â€ 
With the plans made Chase drew the last shift.  With some time till he had to work he decided that some down time was in order.  So he went off to his bunk for the trip.  Sleep found him quickly as he didnâ€™t realize that he was that tired. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
His dreams were vivid. 
Chase saw twin suns that bathed a tan planet with their light and blistering heat.  The planet looked peaceful as if it hadn't been disturbed.  Rolling sand dunes could be seen for as far as the naked eye could see.  The bones from a large creature, made pearly white from the blazing suns, lay off in the distance.  It was quiet save for the wind that blew. 
His vision faded and he saw the coldness of space.  In orbit around the planet it was chaos.  A large ship opens up with its batteries on an unsuspecting ship.  From the distance he saw pieces of durasteel, flames, vented gasses along with bodies escape from the dying vessel. Escape pods rocket violently away from the doomed ship.  They lit up the atmosphere as they entered.
Again his vision faded and came back into view.  Like a disembodied ghost he hung there.  Their voiceless screams evident on their faces as they knew death was about to come. 
The ship exploded.  It was the *Bloodhawk*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chase sat up quickly as he screamed in anguish knowing he was powerless to do anything to stop it.  Breathing hard he looks around and realized he is on the *Port Bound*.  Laying back down he catches his breath as he brings up his hands and presses his palms against his eyes in an attempt to rim the images form his mind. 
â€œItâ€™s just a dream Chase.  Itâ€™s just a dream.  It didnâ€™t happen.â€  He said quietly to himself as he looked at the chrono.  It was thirty minutes till his shift.  Sighing he got up and went to the fresher for a quick clean up.   He walked into the cockpit so see Jensen there. 
â€œHey buddy ready for a break?â€ He asked.
â€œYeah Chase.  You really donâ€™t have to do much just sit here and watch things.  The ship will drop out of orbit on its own.  So no worries ok?â€  As the two exchanged places Jensen noticed the pained look in chaseâ€™s eyes.  â€œYou all right Chase?â€
He shrugged and waved his hand in dismissal.  â€œYeah bad dream, an Imp Star Destroyer laid waste to a passenger liner.â€  When he saw the look on Jensenâ€™s face Chase nodded.  â€œYeah like I said it was a bad dream.  Go get some rest.  Iâ€™ll be ok.â€
With a wave Jensen left him alone in the cockpit.  Looking out he saw the ship passing through hyperspace.  Trying to relax he just couldnâ€™t shake the image of the passenger liner going up in flames.  He closed his eyes and began a relaxing exercise.  He was getting better as he felt himself relax almost instantly.  Taking deep breaths he found his focus and reached out.  He could sense the Captain sleeping and Jensen falling off into slumber. 
--
Four hours passed chase called back to the Captain and Jensen that they would be arriving soon.  Twenty minutes later as the Captain and Jensen arrived in the cockpit the ship dropped out of hyperspace.   There wasnâ€™t much for space traffic as the planet was in the middle of nowhere.  And the fact that there wasnâ€™t much to do on Tatooine meant it wasnâ€™t a tourist attraction. 
When they turned towards the planet chase saw it.  The same Imperial Star Destroyer from his dream.  It was still firing its batteries into the burnt out shell of a ship.  The Captain muttered under her breath and Jensen added to her comment.  â€œBy the stars â€¦â€¦ I hope there was no one on board.â€ Jensen lowers his head in thought.
Chase sat back in shock.  He could feel that there had been a terrible occurrence in the Force here  â€œThere were people on board, many people.â€  His voice sent a shiver up their spines.  Jensen looked at Chase remembering what his friend had said a few hours ago. 
Felen slid into the other seat.  â€œJensen take the cannon, Chase set course for the city of Bestine there is a moisture farm just outside city limits thatâ€™s our buyer.â€
Shaking his head in an attempt to shake the sickening feeling that had settled into the pit of his stomach Chase manipulated the controls and set course for Bestnie.  He made sure to give the Imperial capital ship a wide berth.  The Force must have been with them as the imps left them alone and they arrived at their location unmolested. 
Chase was actually fairly surprised that that the chip was so easy to fly.  With some guidance and help from Captain Felen he was able to set the ship down fairly gently just outside the farm.  â€œWell weâ€™re here and in one piece.  Thanks Captain.â€ Chase said with a smile. 
Felen patted him on the back, â€œGood job Chase! Help us unload I will bargain with the owner and try to get you a ride into town.â€ 
â€œYou got it Captain.â€  Chase took another look out of the viewport towards space.  He didnâ€™t see the Star Destroyer but he knew it was still there.  Shaking his head at the senseless brutality inflicted on the liner he felt his anger rise.  A lesson from Master Garet came to mind.  *Mind your anger young Chase.  Lead you to the Darkside it can.  Only at peace is a Jedi in control.*  He quickly caught up and left the ship with the Captain.
The bright sun made him shield his eyes.  The barrenness of the surrounding area was quite shocking.  Nothing but sand for as far as the eye could see.  He had heard it mentioned that Tatooine was the armpit of the galaxy.  Now he could see why. 
The welcoming committee wasnâ€™t much as it consisted of a Human and a Sullustan.  The two introduced themselves.  Gant Varik and Sallo.  Both had questions about happenings off world. 
Chase shook both of their hands.  â€œIâ€™m Chase he said to Gant.  Iâ€™m from Corellia but weâ€™ve just come in from Druckenwell. 
He looked at Sallo.  â€œIâ€™ve heard others say worse about this planet.â€  He chuckled.  â€œIâ€™ve never been to Sullest sorry.  As far as news, well if it doesnâ€™t come from the empire itâ€™s probably true.  Iâ€™d like to talk more but I have to help unload the cargo.â€  With a quick wave he joined up with Jensen and began the process of unloading the cargo.  Chase saw Felen talking with who Chase assumed was his buyer.  One of the times he was looking her way he saw her pointing at him.  He wasnâ€™t able continue watching as the cargo lift began to give him some problems and he had to fight with it to keep it and its cargo contents safe. 
Chase and Jensen had finished with the cargo and were talking a bit when the Captain and an older human approached.  They stopped talking as Felen introduced old man to them.  â€œChase, meet Raddi Thane the local land owner. He has agreed to take you in until the next trip into Bestine.â€ 
He smiled.  â€œGreat.  Thank you.â€
The old man smiled.  â€œHello there Chase, so how is your working hands?â€ 
The smile never left his face.  â€œWell sir my hands are no stranger to work.  Iâ€™d be happy to help out till the next trip in to Bestine.  Any idea how long that may be?  And what do you all do for fun out here?â€
The conversation was quick and Chase retrieved his gear from the ship.  Making sure he had all of his possessions he headed for the gang plank and disembarked from the *Port Bound*   
He met Jensen just outside the ship.  â€œTake care of yourself buddy.  Stay out of the Imps way.  If you ever need help let me know and Iâ€™ll see what I can do.â€  He shook his friends hand. 
â€œSame goes for you Chase.  Good luck my friend.â€  Jensen said his farewells and entered the ship. 
Captain Felen also came by.  â€œYouâ€™re a good man Chase and a good worker.  I could use another one like you around.  This galaxy can be a dangerous place.â€ 
â€œThanks Captain,â€ Chase said.  â€œBut there are things that I need to do, things that I should have started doing long ago.â€ 
Felen nodded.  â€œI know.  There comes a time when we all have to make a decision Chase.  If you ever see the *Port Bound* docked somewhere stop by.  Youâ€™re always welcome.â€
With the goodbyes said chase backed away from the freighter.  With a whine from the engines it took off and headed away.  He hoped that this would not be the last time he would see his friend but it was a big galaxy and the odds were against that happening. 
Looking back to Raddi he knew it was time to earn his keep.  â€œWell I guess itâ€™s time to get to workâ€

Raddi squints in your direction. â€œWell I recon we could make a trip into town in the morn. Come with me I will show you around.â€ Raddi waits for you to say good bye then walks you around the compound. The mans pace is slowed by a leg injury. Raddi limps along as he shows you the common area storage areas and living area. Raddi points out your temporary bunk then points over to Sallo and Gant, who are loading a speeder. â€œYou can sleep here tonight but for now I need you to go with Sallo and Gant. They will need an extra set of eyes while they check on the moisture vaporators. One can never bee too careful out thereâ€
Raddi slowly walks away heading of to another area of the compound. Sallo waves you over â€œHey lets get started. The work is more boring then anything but easy enough.â€ Sallo and Gant finish loading the speeder which has two seats and an open cargo area in the front. They ask you to sit up front while they drive.
Much of the day is spent driving from moisture tower to tower running diagnostics and keeping a watchful eye out for possible danger. Water is considered a precious commodity on Tatooine valued higher then the slave trade on the planet. Many of the locals are either moisture farmers or slaves. Most of Tatooine peoples are poor if not destitute, though Raddi seams to treat his workers better then most according to Gant and Sallo.
After the days work the farm hands all gather for the nightâ€™s meal in the common area. Raddi`s wife dieses out a mixture stew. Cold and hardy the meal is well received as many dig into the meal. Most find there bunks after dinner tired from the long days work schedule while others converse or sing songs around a central fire as darkness sets in.
Raddi wakes you in the morn the old man looks wide eyed and ready for the day. Though he wakes you far earlier then you are use to you get the feeling the man already put in half a days work. â€œLetâ€™s go son. Time to get supplies in town. The speeder is ready.â€
You and old man Raddi make the short trip into the city of Bestine. The city itself is rough many of the buildings are cobbled together from random parts and local stone. Many of the locals look rough as well most keep to them selves as you pass them and many walk with their eyes to the ground. A few patrols of storm troopers pass you and wave you through after checking the speeder over.
-â€œHalt there!â€ the trooper holds a hand up requesting a stop as his fellow troopers surround the craft searching but finding nothing of interest.
-â€œOk move along, move along.â€ The first trooper motions his hand then looks for the next vehicle to check.
Raddi stops in front of a general store. Inside you can see many other local farmers haggling over various wares. Raddi steps down and starts for the store â€œYouâ€™re a good worker but your young and full of adventure. I can see it in your eyes. I would ask you to stay on the farm house but I know the answer. So I will say good luck to you in your travels, and be smart donâ€™t go losing your head.â€ Raddi turns and disappears into the crowd inside leaving you outside.
Throughout the street merchants of all kinds all races shout out there deals. Water food arms everything and anything. Beside you a Gran eyes you then pokes you. â€œYou look like you be needing a ride. Walk everywhere you can not. Deal for you have I.â€ The Gran motions to a small stable setup in the alley between two buildings where a number of Dewbacks wait sale.

Raddi Gave Chase the grand tour of the compound.  It wasnâ€™t much but they called it home.  It was explained to him that the trip into town would be in the morning.  The short trip, made longer by Radiâ€™s limp, ended up near the sleeping quarters.  He raised his hand and pointed to the building and then back to Sallo and Gant. 
â€œYou can sleep here tonight but for now I need you to go with Sallo and Gant. They will need an extra set of eyes while they check on the moisture vaporators. One can never bee too careful out thereâ€
â€œExtra set of eyes?â€ Chase asked.  â€œWhatâ€™s out there?â€  He let his duffle bag off his shoulder.  As it hit the ground it raised a small dust cloud. 
Raddi looked at Chase and saw the muscles on the young mans frame.  â€œSand People mostly.  But that have been quiet as of late so there shouldnâ€™t be too much of a problem out there.â€ 
â€œSand People huh?â€  Chase repeated having no idea what a Sand Person was.  â€œOk let me stow my stuff and grab some gear.â€  He went into the building and placed his duffel on the bed that creaked.  Opening it up he grabbed out his belt and heavy blaster.  If he was to be out there as an extra set of eyes and protection he might as well be able to defend someone.
He exited the small building back into the bright sunlight that was provided by the two suns.  He fastens his blaster to his side and heads in the direction of Sallo who is waving him over.  The Sullustian eyed his blaster.  â€œHey lets get started. The work is more boring then anything but easy enough.â€  Gant said.
Sallo and Gant finished loading the last box on board.  â€œSit up front Chase weâ€™ll drive.â€  Gant directed.  Chase nodded as he tied the strings to secure the bottom of the holster to his leg and hopped into the speeder. 
With the repulsors engaged the three of them headed out.  The first vaporator wasnâ€™t too far and they were there in about twenty minutes.  As the two worked Chase walked off a bit to have a look around.  When he crested a dune about a hundred meters from Gant and Sallo all he saw were rolling sand dunes.  *What a desolate place.  Nothing but sand for as far as I can see.*  He dug his toe into the sand and looked off to his right.  Off in the distance he could barely make out what appeared to be the bones of some large animal that gleamed white in the blazing sun.  He remembered his dream and shook his head.  Deciding that he had had enough of looking at sand he turned and went back to the two. 
They were just finishing up when he arrived back at the speeder.  He grabbed one of the tool kits and heaved it back onto the speeder.  â€œThereâ€™s not much out here is there?â€  he said with a bit of a grunt from lifting the bag. 
Gant smiled.  â€œNo there isnâ€™t, nothing but sand which is probably why not many come here.â€  He said with a chuckle. 
Sallo looked at him again and then to his blaster that hung there.  Chase wondered if it made him feel uncomfortable.  He wasnâ€™t sure why as there was a long barrel blaster clipped to the speeder. 
â€œChase,â€ Sallo asked.  â€œYou ever use that blaster, it looks well used?â€ 
Chase looked down to the weapon at his side.  It looked well used because it was.  He took a breath and nodded.  â€œI have used it to protect myself or others. Why?â€
Sallo almost looks embarrassed.  â€œNo reason and no offense but you just didnâ€™t seem to be the sort to carry a weapon like that.  Most that do are looking for trouble.â€
Chase smiled.  And patted the shorter Sullustian on the back.  â€œSallo there is a lot about me that you will never know.  But Iâ€™ll tell you one thing. Iâ€™m not like most people.â€ His answer seemed to quell any misgivings that Sallo may have had.  At least Chase hoped it did.  â€œBesides Raddi said I was to be an extra pair of eyes out here for you two.â€ 
The rest of the workday went by like normal.  At least that was what Gant had said.  Chase found out a lot about them, Raddi and Tatooine in the time they were out.  Raddi treated those that worked for him pretty well.  Better than most the two agreed readily.  It was mentioned that they knew of others that worked longer for less pay than they did.  He could tell that they were happy with Raddi. 
After the long hot day all the hands came together for mealtime in the common area.  Raddiâ€™s wife handed out the stew.  While not what he was used to it was filing and tasted better than it smelled. 
Tired from the days work in the hot draining sun Chase sought out his bed.  And settled down for a well-earned nightâ€™s rest.  Fortunately his dreams were noting like the night before. 
--
Chase awoke and saw Raddi in his room.  The man looked like he had already been up for hours.  Itâ€™s still mostly dark out but Chase could make it out that sunrise wasnâ€™t far off.  â€œLetâ€™s go son. Time to get supplies in town. The speeder is ready.â€
He sat up and rubbed his eyes.  â€œIâ€™ll be right out just let me gather my things.â€  Chase put his boot back on and the rest of his clothes.  Making sure that all was still packed away he left his blaster on.  But pulled out his all temp cloak.  It would help protect him from the sun if needed and also help hide the fact that he carried a weapon.  Besided it was still pretty chilly from the night air. 
The trip into Bestine was short.  The city wasnâ€™t much cobbled buildings for the most part.  The locals looked as if they kept to themselves with their heads down and eyes on the ground.  He was about to ask why but he found his answer.  A patrol of storm troopers had a checkpoint set up.  They were waved through after a quick check over. 
He believed they were all set when a trooper called out.  â€œHalt there!â€  The trooper in charge, designated by the orange shoulder plate, along with a few others check the speeder over.  Chase was holding his breath.  He was still a wanted man.  He was sure the Empire hadnâ€™t forgotten.  But maybe way out here on the Outer Rim looking for wanted men wasnâ€™t so high up on the list. 
â€œOk move along, move along.â€  The first trooper said and waved his hand.  Chase relaxed and Raddi saw it as Chase moved his hand from his blaster that was hidden under the cloak.  The old man simply nodded to Chase and continued to drive till they came to a stop in front of a general store.  Looking inside from the street he saw other local farmers haggling over various items. 
The two of them get out of the speeder and Raddi walks slowly around the speeder to stand in front of Chase.  â€œYouâ€™re a good worker but your young and full of adventure. I can see it in your eyes. I would ask you to stay on the farmhouse but I know the answer. So I will say good luck to you in your travels, and be smart donâ€™t go losing your head.â€ With that he turned and walked into the store leaving him outside.
Chase smiled when Raddi said that he was full of adventure.  He had learned form the beginning that a Jedi does not seek out adventure.  *They may not seek adventure but it sure does seem to find them.*   He thought. 
He looked around not exactly sure on where to go but he knew what he needed to do.  Find Rasenâ€™s wife.  The computer search on Druckenwell didnâ€™t give him much info.  Maybe now that he was on the planet his searching might prove more fruitful. 
Walking through the streets he makes sure to keep an eye out and keep track of his stuff.  This is the last place he wants to have something stolen.  He hears venders calling out for all sorts of wares.  Water, arms, practically anything one could think of.  He kept walking till he was poked.  Turning quickly he spies a Gran.  â€œYou look like you be needing a ride. Walk everywhere you can not. Deal for you have I.â€  Chase looks past the Gran to where he indicated.  Several dewbacks were tethered in the alley. 
He shook his head.  â€œNo thank you.  I do not have need for transportation.â€  He saw the Granâ€™s expression fall a bit.  He continued quickly.  â€œNo need for transportation yet.  What I need to find is a computer terminal so I can look someone up locally.  After that I may need transportation.â€  The Granâ€™s expression returned to one of a possible sale.
The Gran pointed down the street.  â€œDown there the larger building.  It is what passes as the city administration building in there a terminal you will find.  Remember to come back I have six younglings to feed and they are hungry.  Business as been slow.â€ 
Chase nodded in thanks and walked towards the building making sure to keep his cloak around him covering his blaster.  When he arrived at the building the Gran pointed out he stopped.  Looking up the building was nothing special.  It was larger than most but it did say the cities name across the archway.  Raising an eyebrow he ascended the few steps to the doors. 
Inside was nondescript.  The ever-present dust form the planet was everywhere.  Spying a terminal he activated it and began the search for Rasenâ€™s wife.  He set his bag down and placed it between him and the terminal.  Tapping the keys he entered the info he had,  Rasen and his wife first and last names along with their race.  Hopefully it would give him something useful this time.  â€œThis better work.â€ He said quietly. 
OOC:
Computer use check I guess for finding Rasenâ€™s family.  +7 to the roll.

Surprisingly or not the local administration building is sparely populated. Behind a single desk sleeps a Rodian â€œclerkâ€ and of the four computer terminals only two look to be functional. Few others come in but when they do they do not stay long. A few leave grumbling about the lack of service. The computer itself is fairly rudimentary and the data within nothing less then chaotic.
You spend some time trying to make sense of the data base, not due to lack of skill but rather a much disorganized filing system. It becomes obvious early in your search that few of Tatooine`s residents actually register maybe because they want no part with the empire others who would rather not draw unwanted attention from the Hutts. Many entries for births and deaths are marked unknown and the various population counts dating back years contradict each other.
After another hour you stumble across an employment manifest for a small farm outside Mos Eisley. You would have passed by it except for one name on the short list â€œRasen race unknown.â€ Mos Eisley is a local space port city not too far from Bestine, though you will need transport to get across the desert sea.

the heat was beginning to rise as Chase tapped away on the terminal. Looking up he took in his surroundings. It wasn't much though by the planets standards it's possible it could be a step up from most. Noticing the other patron leaving and muttering something about service he shakes his head and realizes that is not the case. Bestine is a dive. The two flickering terminals, the signified their current working state, confirmed his thought.
After spending an bit of time at the terminal he was beginning to feel that it was a fruitless effort he was putting forth. the lack of entries and missing files was making finding anything pertinent difficult or almost impossible. He noticed two "cities" that began with Mos Es. Mos Eisley and Mos Espa.
An hour later he found something. An employment manifest for a small farm had Rasen's name on it. His race was marked as "unknown" *Makes sense out here. Stang I didn't even know his race when I first met him.* He smiled at the thought. Rasen had been shy at first but then opened up a bit more when Chase has been aboard the *Bloodhawk* for a job or two.
"Mos Eisley it is then" he said under his breath as he looked around. Only two other beings had been in since he began looking. This building was clearly not a place of major importance. With a few more taps of the keys he found the farms name.
He left the building and held a hand just over his eyes long enough to let them adjust. "Now I just need a way to get there." Looking back up the road he saw where the Gran was perched still pushing his "transportation". From this distance he could swear that he heard the calls from the aliens animals. *Maybe I can find another way to Mos Eisley? Speeder maybe."*
Hoisting his bag back on his shoulder he set out. He walked a bit towards the Gran not really wanting to. Seeing a kid walking towards him chase stopped him. "Excuse me," When the kid turned to him He saw that it was more of a young teen maybe fourteen-fifteen years old. He was about to walk off again but he spoke again quickly. "I need to get to Mos Eisley. Any place I can get a speeder ride there?"
the kid looks around and points back to where the Gran is. Chase shook his head. "No, I need a speeder. I can pay for the services." Wanting to be going the kid pointed off in the other direction towards the edge of town. With out a word being spoken the boy was off again at a quicker pace.
Chase shrugged. *Maybe it's this place or the Imperial presence. That is causing this aversion.* Repositioning his bag he set off in the second direction the kid pointed to. Hopefully he would find what he needed. Maybe today would meet Rasen's wife, Dosenna and tell her the news of her husband. He wasn't looking forward to it but he made the promise to his friend.

With some direction provided from an extensive computer search you head back out into the market streets. The crowds continue to shop and sell. Imperial troopers pass by scanning the crowds, they even stop a few individuals for no apparent reason. You begin to scan the area yourself not exactly sure of your next move. Looking for some kind of an answer you look over the people in the street the merchantâ€™s speeders beasts of burden, you need transportation but something feels out of place.
Trying to shake the feeling you spot a robed figure down the street. He looks familiar but you do not place it until he motions with his hand. The man continues to wave his hand until you realize he is motioning for you. You begin to walk towards the man and catch a glimpse of his face. Rubbing your eyes you can not believe the sight before you. Its master Garet, aged a little from when you last saw him but it is your old master.
Pushing your way through the crowded street you make your to his last position. Franticly you swing around looking for your old master. Walking down a little further you scan the area looking for the man a task made very difficult with the growing crowds. Looking down an alley you catch a glimpse of a robe disappearing down the alley and around a corner. Afraid you might loss him again you rush after him, though the alley and around the corner. You run straight into a male Duros who seams shocked at the abrupt introduction.
Looking at the man you realize that master Garet may have lead you to him perhaps a manifestation of the force itself. Such an occurrence should not be ignored. The man looks as though he is hiding, no running from something. The Duros lowers his head as a trio of troopers march by.
