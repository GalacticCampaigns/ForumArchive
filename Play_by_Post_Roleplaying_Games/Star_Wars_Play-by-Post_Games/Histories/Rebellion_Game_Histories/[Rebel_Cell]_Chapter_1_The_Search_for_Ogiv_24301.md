# [Rebel Cell] Chapter 1: The Search for Ogiv

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-30 15:17:18)

> Taris
> An ecumenopolis on par with Coruscant and Nar Shadda.
> At least, it **was**, millennia ago. Before the Jedi Civil War so long ago, the planet was covered by one giant city, which spared only the ocean in its quest for dominance. Its populace had been deeply divided between the wealthy human nobles and the lower class aliens, with the two classes rarely meeting. Then, the Jedi abandoned the city, allowing it to fall into chaos. Soon after that, Darth Malak and the Sith Fleet bombarded the city from above, killing millions. And thus the city remained for centuries, with few inhabitants.
> That changed, however, when a group of human colonists landed on the planet and began to rebuild the planet as a trading post, especially for the ships that the colonists built. While many of the cities are still in ruins, many of them are now rebuilt and flourishing. Because of that economic boom, the Emperor in his wisdom has sent a Star Destroyer to protect our skies, and a garrison of troops to protect our cities. It is because of this that Taris is now, once again, a center for trade.

As you watch, the hologram showing the planet of Taris pans out, showing the orbiting Star Destroyer, before finally replacing the image with that of the Imperial Crest. These motivating messages seem to come across the planetary holo-net on a regular basis, reminding everyone of the benefits of having the Empire watching over. As the publicity commercial fades and the holo-show named "Keri Coyls" resumes its episode entitled, "I married a Wookie. So the frak what?", showing humans who have married Wookies, breaking the news to their parents on the planetary holo-net. Their parents are being shown to cry and weep, chairs are being thrown, and someone already lost an arm when they slapped their daughter and her husband got a little carried away. Various security personnel were currently in the process of trying to pry a female Wookie from a female human, the human screaming the entire time, **"He loves me! He loves me! What've you got to give him? Huh? I make him happy!"**. The show is considered one of the examples that holo-shows have become horrible cess pools for the uneducated.
It's also rated number one on the planet.
As you sit around the cantina in the lower section of Taris City, the main capital of the planet, Kira and Ganner, sitting next to each other and watching the door, notice a human wearing worn trousers and a faded shirt walk in and look them directly in the eye. Kira and Ganner immediately recognize the human male as Captain Verana of Rebel Insurgency Forces Command, of which the team is a cell. Walking purposely away from the group, Verana makes for a private room in the back, looking over his shoulder at the group one last time before walking in and shutting the door.
It's obvious that your next mission has arrived.

Shaking his head and nearly feeling nauseated at the quality of todayÂ´s holoshows, Ganner gets up from his chair.
"Well, IÂ´m done with eroding what remains of my intellect, so I guess IÂ´ll go and find me something more productive to do"
Waiting a few moments not to seem suspicious, Ganner walks over to the same private room that Verana had entered, casually slipping in and closing the door behind him.

Kira watches the holonet program with the same fasination one has with a terrible accident: one wants to look away, but it is so terrible one can't.
"This is one of the reasons I don't understand people," she says to herself, turning away from the bizzare specticle before her to watch Ganner walk away. She then scans the rest of the room in order to make sure no one else appears to be paying them any undo attention.

Darren nods at the others' comments, agreeing with their opinions on the program. He taps his knuckle on the table a few times, keeping his good eye on the other patrons of the cantina. "Right then. Looks like we're on." After a reasonable wait, he motions to Kira, saying, "Come on. Two of us this time. Last two follow afterwards." With that he stands and makes his way casually to the private room, not waiting for Kira to follow.

"Oh, wait up!" Kira says, putting on Cute Little Girl Voice #5. It would help to divert suspicion if she seemed less intelligent. She follows Darren into the private room, and as soon as she is out of sight, reverts right back to her usual, more mature state.

An empty glass hit the bar almost too hard as Kip lowered his metallic arm quickly releasing his vice like grip. He leaned over his shoulder as the other cell members entered the backroom. And flipping a credit to the barman, he followed a few moments later. His cyborg leg punctuating each step as it collided with the hard floor.

As the group walks into the room and shuts the door behind them, Captain Verana, places a moderately sized disc on the table. The disc is about the size of a dinner plate. Before anyone can say anything, he holds his finger to his lips and then presses a button on the plate-shaped disc. A series of buttons light up along one side. Finally, Verana lowers his hand and nods to the group.
> **Verana wrote:**

> It&#39;s ok now. This sound sponge will ensure that no one and nothing outside a meter radius will here us. So, make sure that you don&#39;t get away from the table, or you&#39;ll miss something.

Drawing his blaster pistol, Verana places it on the table, stock facing away from himself and towards the group. This is normal, or course, in the Rebellion. A tradition dating back to the founding of the organization by Organa, Iblis, and Mon Mothma. Any member of the Rebellion had to be so sure of his comrades that he'd trust his weapon, and thus his life, to them. It is tradition for each person at the meeting to do the same.
Once everyone else has placed their sidearms on the table, Verana takes another small disc out, this one easily recognizable as a holo-projector, Verana places it on the table and activates it. A small image of a thin human male, wearing Imperial gray, hovers over the table.
> **Verana wrote:**

> We&#39;ve received word that a highly-skilled Imperial technician has disappeared among the population of Taris. This technician, a former employee of Sienar Fleet Systems, is rumored to have worked on a new Imperial fighter design, but he went into hiding after apparently discovering something that Sienar would rather not have known to the galaxy at large. Rebel agents were able to track the technician here, where they lost his trail. I would like for you four to track him down and recruit him to join our organization. The technicianâ€™s name is Ogiv Sonmorten. He booked passage to Corellia on a freighter captained by a friend of the Senator Organa. Captain Farstander contacted the Senator after docking on Corellia, but he will not be able to remain on Corellia for long due to previous arrangements. He is willing to meet with you and give you a local contact that might be able to help, but that is the extent to which he is able to help you at this time.
> I&#39;m sure that I don&#39;t need to impress on any of you the importance of a mission like this. The Empire continues to hound our fighters with more and more advanced fighters in greater numbers. While there&#39;s no doubt that our boys are of superior stock, that only gets us so far. If this man has information on a new starfighter design, then we need that information. And, if he&#39;s as great a technician as we think he is, then we need him as well.
> Captain Farstander is currently docked at the space dock in Majoria, several hundred kilometers north of here. Here, take this data disk. When you find Sonmorten, give it to him. Then, do everything in your power to get him to join our cause. If he does, he&#39;ll have to be gotten off world as soon as possible. There&#39;s a small transport ship waiting at the edge of the system. If you can convince him to join us, and get him to that ship, then we&#39;ll have recruited ourselves a great asset in the war against the Empire.

As Captain Farstander finishes, he picks the holo-emitter back up and pockets it. Retrieving his pistol and re-holstering it, Verana looks at each member of the cell and nods his head. Finally, he retrieves his sound sponge and leaves the room. From the main room of the cantina, Keri Coyls can still be heard from the main holo-projector, talking about how families should accept each other, but that people should stick to their own kind as well.
As the group waits a few moments to make sure they aren't seen to all come out together, it occurs to both Darren and Ganner that meeting up with a potential contact in Majoria would be difficult. It was no more than thirty kilometers from the Imperial Garrison on Taris. While pistols and folding rifles were allowed, heavy weapons were not. Being caught with one would mean jail time. Also, the stormtrooper patrols in the area made it hard to sneak around. Not impossible, just difficult. Also, the troopers were known for hassling people, especially non-humans, especially **armed** non-humans.

Darren rubs his temples, groaning slightly. "Who the kriff picked Majoria as a meeting place? I need to fill his or her face full of plasma." Shaking his head, he stands, looking around their small group. "Right, first things first. Getting to the meeting place. We need something fast and low-profile. Ideas?"

"Well, I did install a fake transponder on the *Return* so we could move around undisturbed. As far as I know, thereÂ´s no warrant out for the Corulag-origined freighter *Renegade*. And I suppose thereÂ´s some kind of docking bay or landing platform over there, so getting there should be no problem"
He looked around at the others, showing that he really didnÂ´t think transport would be a problem.
"What I am a little concerned about is the proximity to the Imperial garrison. Stormtroopers might be dumb as rocks, but there is a lot of them, especially near their own turf"

### **zenkatarn** (2009-08-02 19:05:35)

Darren nods, smiling at Kira's comment. "Correct. If we don't give them a reason to suspect us, we should get through fine." He turns to face Ganner as he says, "It seems transport won't be a problem then. Unless anyone has any objections, we move now. Time is a factor here, so let's not waste any." He pauses to make sure no one else wants to add anything before leading the way out of the cantina.

"Sounds good to me. I´ll prep the ship for launch then. Swing by when you´ve picked up anything you might need"
Getting up from his chair, Ganner headed out of the cantina, and started off for the hangar where he kept the *Return* docked.

Ganner makes it to his ship without incident and begins the prep work for lift off, talking to the dock management, etc.

The quick flight to Majoria goes off without incident and the ship lands at the spaceport at docking bay 49. After landing the ship, Ganner handles the docking procedures, including getting his voucher chit from one of the deck hands who tells Ganner that the spaceport charges 20 credits a day in docking fees, payable before being allowed back onto the ship.

It's rather obvious that this deck hand's dealt with these conversational topics before.
Question is, how to find Captain Farstander?
(Also, make sure that you include what weaponry you're taking with you from the ship. You know, in case stormies see you or something. >:D )

"Right, now we move to step two: Finding the good captain Farstander." Darren grabs and holsters his heavy blaster pistol, the only weapon in his possession, before disembarking from the vessel. "I guess we start by just asking around." That said, he begins asking people he sees if they've heard of captain Farstander before, and if they might happen to know where he is.

Making sure her vibrodagger and hold out blaster are hidden properly, Kira finishes by holstering her Bryar pistol. Looking in the mirror, she practises a couple of innocent smiles before leaving the ship, ready to get some information on the good Captain they were looking for.

"Well, we can´t have that, now can we?"
Paying the deposit, Ganner looks around inside the space port.
"Hey, you wouldn´t happen to know where I can find an information terminal, would you?"
At his side hangs his trusty DT-12, fully visible, with no effort made to conceal it. Before departing the ship, he had made sure that the integrated hold-out blaster in his computer bracer was functional, and the same for the small switchblade hidden in his code cylinder.

The deck hand dismissively nods at Ganner and points him to a standard public terminal located on a nearby wall. As Ganner begins searching the data-stream, Kira and Darren both start working the crowds, each in their own way.
Kira notices that quite a lot of men are willing to stop and offer her a hand, trying to encourage her to let them escort her to whatever location she would want. Such helpful gents.
Darren's natural leadership skills get him words with a few of the older pilots, the ones that respect hard work.
Either way, Kira and Darren both find out that Farstander is located in docking bay 27. Ganner also discovers that he's packing his ship to leave within a couple of hours.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-08-06 10:32:17)

Darren returns to the group with the information. "Listen up, people. Our contact's in docking bay 27. Get whatever else you need together from the ship and lets go."

"Oh, look at that," Kira says to the man she's talking too not far from the rest of the group.
"One of my friends *already* found it out for me! I'm *so* sorry for wasting your time! Thank you *so* much!"
One she sends the man away, she returns to the rest of the group, dropping the little girl act.
"Okay, so lets get going."

Kip nodded as he walked down the ship's ramp, discarding a used ciggara with a flick. His arms hung at his side as he walked through the group and towards Docking bay 27. He didn't have to make any effort to conceal his weapon, if an enemy was close enough to notice the flechette launcher, they were well within range for a deadly shot.

## Re: Rebel Cell: Chapter 1: The Search for Ogiv

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-06 19:35:08)

Acknowledging that the others were moving, Ganner left the terminal and started to make his way towards bay 27. While moving, he pulled up his comlink.
"Lets move it, it appears as if we are on the clock here"

As the lot of you reach docking bay 27, you find your typical freighter captain overseeing the loading of merchandise by labor droids.
> **Farstander wrote:**
>
> Come on you rust buckets! Get a move on!

As you enter, Kip accidentally bumped into one of the crates, causing a hydrospanner to fall on the ground, making a clacking sound. The captain turns around at the noise, drawing his blaster and training it on Kip.
> **Farstander wrote:**
>
> Who are you? What business do you have here?

You can tell that he's not necessarily a violent person, he's just surprised to see four armed people entering the docking bay and is a little alarmed.

Farstander cocks his head to the side at the mention of Organa. Relaxing his grip on his pistol, but not putting it away, just yet, Farstander offers a smile.

"Well, sir," Kira says plainly, "We are looking for a passenger you might have ferried recently. A man by the name of Ogiv."
As this man already appeared to be an ally, Kira felt no need to put on any act, and so remained her usual, stoic self.

### **zenkatarn** (2009-08-11 12:59:09)

Darren smiles, making a great show of *not* reaching for his blaster. "Indeed, we were told to meet with one Captain Farstander here. I suppose that would make you him, yes?" With a nod towards Kira, he says, "As my associate said, we're looking for Ogiv Sonmorten. Know where he might have gone off to?"

He said he needed to talk to someone about selling some information that he&#39;d found. If he&#39;s gone to sell information, the person to check with would be Kuunjo. He&#39;s an information broker. Actually, he&#39;s **the** information broker on Tarus. If there&#39;s any secret being moved around for credits, he&#39;d know about it. Of course, finding Kuunjo&#39;s not the easiest thing in the universe, you understand. He&#39;s rather secretive. Probably the side effect of selling everyone else&#39;s secrets. But, I&#39;m sure that you could find him if you started looking around. Either that or he&#39;ll find you, but I think you&#39;d rather find him than the other way around.

Darren nods, saying, "Thank you for the information. We'll leave immediately." As he leaves the hanger and hears Farstander's mutter, he smiles. "As it is with all of us," he says under his breath, too quiet for anyone not standing right beside him to hear.

## Re: Rebel Cell: Chapter 1: The Search for Ogiv

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-14 07:11:43)

As they left captain Farstander, Ganner looked to the others.
"Well, better get to work then. If we´re going to contact an information broker, I suppose it couldn´t hurt to have some kind of juicy information to barter with, wouldn´t you agree? I was thinking that maybe I should head over to the Imperial Outpost and dig around a bit inside their network"
While he talked, a smile formed on his face. If there was something he really loved, it was messing around with Imperial networks, causing all kinds of havoc.
