# Chapter 1: A Twist of Fate and Destiny

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-12 22:01:18)

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic
Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station
with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home
aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The
tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone structure
centered in an opening of rocky hills putting a dusk look upon the sky.
A light wind whips above the ricky hills which seemingly protect
the structure from even the worst of any sandstorm that may come.
The sound of a Voice comes from a medium homestead consisting of
three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall
moisture vaporators and one large adobe block house.
A small figure appears out of the the stairs from the Largest of
the holes, Ala Solari a 8 Year little girl that despite her harsh
environment is quite the sweetheart with her blonde hair and blue eyes.
She looks around with her hand on her forehead blocking the sun light from
her eyes.
Ala: "Repal! Aiden! Where are you! Mama says to come in it's getting late!"
Ala waits and looks around for them.
(GM) Ok guys if you don't mind describe yourself and feel free to go)

Qur'aiden mumbled to himself as he gave the lug on the clutch plate assembly one last affirming twist. He remained crouching, shuffling around to tinker with something else on the speeder that didn't appear to need tinkering with.
The young Miralukan squatted in the minimal shade that the old Flare-S provided. His lanky white hair fluttered in the small dust storm created by the swoop, causing him to intermittently sweep a hand up to move wayward strands of hair from the cloth covering his eyes.
"Come in it's gettin' late! Fleh! Come out here and make me come in, why don'tcha! Kriffin'..." Qur'aiden continued to grumble under his breath, sucking on a finger tenderly when his expletive-laden rant causes him to pinch his pinky with a tool.

It had been some time since he felt the heat from TatooineÂ´s twin suns, but it but it didnÂ´t bother him too much. It just felt like he was home. Neeman smiled as he approached the small settlement. Even though he was still a while away, he could still make out the identity of the voice he had just heard. It had to be the little girl, Ala. He mused at the memory of how she used to beg him to tell stories of what he had been doing in the time between his visits to the orphanage.
Adjusting the rifle on his shoulder, he continued his walk towards the settlement.

Ala sees the figure in the distance heading towards her. Her eyes focus on the figure and she starting jumping with a smile. She begins to shout with Joy.
Ala: "MAMA!!! MAMA!! Neeman is coming!!! MAMA Come see Neeman is here!!"
As the Ala jumps for joy and in her thoughts the wondrous stories of other worlds, a Taller Figure Emerges from the stair of the Main Structure. A Woman with brunette hair with streaks of gray as her hand moves the hair from her face showing her green eyes and kind face looks towards the approaching Gran she knows and loves as Neeman. She is Viqi Starfire. Viqi puts her hand on Ala's head to calm her a bit.
Viqi: "Yes Ala I know, he will be here in a bit now go along inside and help Jett with setting another place for dinner and wait till we finish to ask him about his adventure ok?"
Viqi looks down at Ala with a smile as she looks back up at her with a look of joy and runs back down the stairs. Viqi looks out towards Neeman with a wave then as her hand goes down she look over towards the speeder bike with a grin.
Viqi: "Qur'aiden if you don't get inside and wash up you might wake up tomorrow in the refresher again for a surprise bath and the water might be cold this time."
Viqi looks around some more trying to notice where Repal might have gone off too as she waits for Neeman.

Repal breaks into a run when he hears the voice of Ala. He had completely lost track of the time between wandering and his visit with Tebb.
As he comes closer, he stops to catch his breath. He then moves forward at a more relaxed pace with one hand over his eyes, as though he is trying to block out the sun.
In reality, however, he is making a rather poor attempt to hide a rather impressive black eye, made all the more noticeable by his almost bleach white complextion.
"Sorry I'm so late," he says quietly, while trying to make it inside fast enough for no one to notice.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-13 19:25:10)

Neeman canÂ´t stop himself from breaking into laughter when he hears AlaÂ´s outcries. SheÂ´d be thrilled about what he had to tell this time. And soon "mama" appeared. She seemes well enough from the distance, and Neeman offered a wave at the sight of the woman who had taken care of him so long ago when he had ended up on tatooine after the terror on Kinyen. He also catches sight of some of the other children, Repal and the Aiden. He still canÂ´t really come to terms with where that kid comes from. He has travelled a lot in his days, and never seen anyone else like him. It doesnÂ´t matter though, as long as they stay with Viqi theyÂ´ll be fine.
He walks casually into the settlement, puts his rifle aside, and gives the woman a big hug and breaks out a big smile.
"So, hiw have you been?"
((Btw, itÂ´s a *Gran*, not a *Gand*. Totally different species : ))

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-13 19:45:18)

Viqi smiles back at Neeman.
Viqi: "Well I'm still getting old but with these Younglings around I never get time to feel old."
Viqi look back as Repal heads down the Stairs
Viqi: "Even if I was to lose my sight Repal, I would still know you have a black eye or a bruise from a fight, go wash up for dinner and I will tend to it later as I am sure you will tell me all about it."
She looks back at Neeman shaking her head with a smile.
Viqi: "With him and Aiden I will never get to feel old. They both are so much alike but I suppose they are just anxious to see the galaxy like you. Come inside and tell me how the galaxy has been treating you."
She gestures for him to walk with her inside to the main area below the Opening in the the Structure where the Table has been set. Ala sits anxiously awaiting for them to eat.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-13 19:53:02)

Neeman follows behind Viqi, giving a big smile to Ala as he sees her.
"Well, you know how things are these days. The Empire is not at all fond of anyone who is not human, so jobs have become scarcer and scarcer out there. But I get by"
He takes a seat at the table.
"But who knows, maybe things will change now"

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-13 20:10:44)

Viqi shows sadness in her face for a moment then seemingly catching herself smiles.
Viqi: "I'm sure things will Nee..."
Jett: "HEY! When did Neeman get here, nobody told me!"
A young Twi'lek walking out from the kitchen interrupts Viqi. Jett Narson the 17 Year old Twi'lek who's Green Skin and Yellow Eyes make him stand out in the dusk lighting as the sun goes down.
Ala: "If you hadn't been hacking Mama's Droids you would have heard me."
Ala states as she always has never been one to be honest, even if she get herself or others in trouble. Jett get a sudden shock on his face as if he had just seen a Rancor in front of him.
Jett: "I...I...I..ummm Sorry...I will work in the shop and make up for it...."
Viqi Smiles at Jett and Ala
Viqi: "You have always had a thing for Droids, I can't change that but please tell me they won't go Jury Rig Aidens speeder bike or lock Repal in the Refresher again..."
Jett: "No I promise....well...I will go make sure it won't..."
Jett hurries back off before Viqi can say a word.

"Sorry," Repal said timidly as he went in. He could stare down some of the toughest brutes in Mos Entha, but a single word from Viqi could send him packing like a dog with its tail between its legs.
After washing up and doing a quick examination of his eye, he slowly emigrates to the table.
"Hi, Neeman," he says, smiling from his seat.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-12-13 23:35:31)

Aiden slams his hydrospanner into a loop on his tool belt, taking a long moment to rise to his feet and stretch in obvious defiance of Viqi. He turns, catching sight of Viqi, and shoves his hands into his pockets as he scurries into the house.
"Wash me... I'ma wash you one of these days... There will be a reckonin', just you wait and see! We won't always suffer' under such tyranny!"
The young Miralukan waggles an bony finger in the air as he continues to mutter, but still he doesn't break stride or slow down any further.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-14 14:40:20)

"Jett, Repal, good to see you are still giving Viqi something to do"
Upon seeing Aiden in his still defiant way, he canÂ´t help but worry a bit for the kid.
*If you think this tyrrany kid, then I hope you get to stay here forever…*

After a Night of stories and of some lectures about fighting, stealing from the local junkyard and reprogramming customers droids to pull pranks, everyone heads off to sleep. During the night however there comes a rumble as if something is coming and as some stir from this everyone awakens to a large crash. It sounds as if the sky has fallen on you all as smoke and sand fill the air with an intense heat.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-14 22:09:46)

Repal awoke with a start. Instinctively, he reached out for his medical kit, knowing a sound that loud could very well be accompanied by an injury.
"What's going on?" he coughs through the smoke and sand.
"Viqi! Aiden! Is everyone okay?"

---

### **Anazider** (2008-12-15 21:48:13)

"Who-what?!"
Qur'aiden jumps up from his sleep, laying about for his staff and rolling to his feet once he finds it.
"So they've finally come, huh? Well, they'll never take Qur the Quick alive, no sir!"
Moving to a nearby view port, Aiden peers out, using a hand to shield his cloth-covered eyes.
(Sense Surroundings to take a look)

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-15 22:17:25)

The area had been deafened by the initial impact but you can hear a voice coming from the other side of the main are, where the Viqi and Ala sleep.
Viqi: "We are fine Repal, is Aiden and Jett with you?"
You notice Aiden in the room with you Repal, but Jett doesn't seem to be around and as far as you know Neeman is in the guest room.
Aiden senses his surroundings and knows where most everyone is, though Jett is somewhere outside, not sure where though but you also sense two energies, they are not Organic and you can't tell where they are.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-15 23:49:27)

"Aiden's here," Repal answered, worry evident in his voice, "But I don't see Jett anywhere!"

---

### **Anazider** (2008-12-15 23:49:50)

Qur'aiden fully shakes himself to wakefulness. Tapping his staff against the ground, he cocks an ear as if listening intently to something outside the viewport.
"Jett's out there somehow, probably getting blown up by whatever the kriff that was..."
The miralukan boy frowns to himself, idly twirling the staff from one hand to the other.
"...And whatever'n it is, sounds like there's two of'm. Definitely not made of squishy bits, that's for certain."
Kicking his staff up over a shoulder, Aiden turns for the backdoor while whistling.
"Well Viqi, it was a nice run, shame its gotta end like this. I say we all lightspeed it outta here 'fore Jett's creations compact us into cubes, 'er somethin' else!"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-16 04:51:44)

Woken by the heavy crash, Neeman almost jumps out of bed. Just for precaution, he grabs his rifle before moving out into the larger area. With the smoka and dust covering the area, he canÂ´t see very well, so he cries out to the others.
"Viqi? Kids? you OK?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-16 19:16:32)

Viqi: " We are fine Neeman but the sand and dust makes it rather unpleasant in here, we are going to head outside and meet are new guests."
The sand and dust has settled some more but there is still a slight haze, but you see Viqi leading Ala to the stair that head up and outside the structure.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-16 19:57:34)

"Wait!" Repal calls out after Viqi and Ala, going up the stairs after them.
"It could be dangerous."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-16 22:18:00)

Viqi heads up the stairs and Ala looks back as Repal chases them and yawns, its quite obvious she is unaware of whats going on and she is not quite awake.
Ala: "Repal...don't be so lound....*Yawns* are you in trouble again?"
As they head up Viqi, Ala and Repal are the next to see an escape pod having crashed close to the edge of the Opening above the center area.
It appears to have come down at the side of the shop and slid to the edge. The wall facing facing towards you all has crumbled over from the impact and it appears there maybe something under the debris.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-17 04:01:22)

Following the others up the stairs, Neeman looks suprised when he sees the crashed pod and the wrecked wall. Carefully moving out among the debris, he calls out.
"Anybody here?"

---

### **Anazider** (2008-12-17 09:53:35)

"And if you're all dead, can we have your stuff?"
Aiden calls out just after Neeman, following the rest up the stairs and out to the scene of the fallen escape pod. He walks around the pod and near the crumbled wall, tapping bits of the wreckage as he goes.
"We've got a spice mine here! Gotta hurry up and salvage this thing 'for the stinkin' Jawas or Imps get word of what's goin' on!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-17 14:22:04)

Repal looks around and does a head count. Ala, Viqi, Neeman, Aiden...
No Jett.
Worry starts to form in Repal as he searches for the last member of their, for lack of a better term, family.
"Where's Jett? I thought you said he was out here Aiden!"
((*Perception+8 to find Jett*))

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-17 16:59:18)

"Aiden, get away from there"
Neeman pulls the kid away from the debris, not really wanting the thing to blow up in the his face, or possibly have the wall fall down over him.
Hearing Repal cry out, he looks around for Jett.
((Perception +7, Darkvision))

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-17 23:49:06)

From the gape in the now crumbled wall, Repal and Neeman see Jett inside the shop who happens to wave at you two and heads out quickly through the front door of the shop, behind him are the two droids.
Jett: "Hey guys sorry about not being out here when you came out, but I wanted to see if we could get Aiden's Speeder Bike from under the Busted Wall."
The Protocal Droid bows a bit and acknowledges you all.
C-3PO: "Oh my we are quite sorry for landing on your home, I for one thought we we're doomed and we're going to crash into the rocks, oh my manners I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is
my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
R2-D2's head spins about looking at you all.
R2-D2 " Dwooo!" Binary "Hi"
Viqi stand off by herself and seems deep in thought about something. Ala however walks over to the C-3PO and grabs his hand.
Ala: "I like you, you should stay away from Aiden though he might try to sell you for credits...he isn't very nice to droids..."
C-3PO: "OH Dear..."
Ala: " I won't let him, don't worry, do you want to go play?"

---

### **Anazider** (2008-12-19 17:04:13)

"You're kriffin' right Aiden'll sell you- wait whose bike is underwhere now?"
Qur'aiden nimbly bounds over debris and bits of wreckage to get to where his swoop resides buried.
"Sweet Palpy's Beard Hairs! Look what they did to the Nebula Blazer!"
Crouching down, the boy strokes the swoop's fairing, as if soothing a wounded warhorse.
"Don't worry old girl, it'll be all right... Daddy's here..."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-19 18:44:43)

Repal smiles and chuckles quietly, partly from Aiden's antics, but also out of relief that no one was hurt.
He then turns his attention to the vessel which had crashed into their home. It wasn't what Repal thought a space ship should look like. Too small, for one thing.
"What happened?" he asked 3PO, hoping to catch him before Ala ran off too far with him.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-19 19:16:30)

Although he had been through some weird thing in his travels, this was new to Neeman. An escape pod with two droids crashing through the roof. If only this had happended when he was away from Tatooine, how little Ala would have loved such a story. Walking a little closer to the pod to check it out, he looked over the two droids.
The protocol droid looked harmless enough, and the other one - an astromech droid if he wasnÂ´t mistaken - looked the same. Still, he wondered why such a couple would end up in an escape pod.
"Yeah, IÂ´d like to know how you two wound uo here as well"

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-20 20:28:27)

C-3PO manages to get Ala to slow a bit as he looks back to you all.
C-3PO: "Oh My it was quite stressful our ship came under attack by Imperials, R2 managed to get me into that escape pod...."
R2-D2 seems to whistle and beep about something important, but none of you have any idea what the little droid is saying except for Jett and 3PO.
Jett: "Obi-Wan Kenobi? Is that your owner?"
C-3PO: "I have no idea who that is, I think he has fried his Processor from the landing."
Viqi seems startled by the name, though none of you have ever seen Viqi even jump when surprised. Viqi walks quickly over to R2 with a concern in her face.
Viqi: "I don't know how you know that name but...it doesn't matter...You will be escorted in the morning to where he lives..."
Viqi with a stern look on her face looks to Neeman then looks at the rest of you.
Viqi: "All of you go inside now and rest, Neeman I need to speak with you in private."

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-21 02:54:14)

Repal was still curious, but he saw the face Viqi was making and heard the voice she used. It would do no good arguing.
"Alright. Goodnight," he said, knowing his buzzing mind would probably keep him up for the rest of the night. Oh well, at least he'd have a new story for Tebb.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-12-21 10:33:54)

Aiden furrows his brow in a squint at Viqi, as if attempting to comprehend her words, while continuing to pat the swoop. But the young boy is familiar with that tone, and before he mopes off back towards the recessed stairwell leading into the house.
...But he doesn't mope too far, taking a detour away from the others to loop back around towards the open space, intent on eavesdropping on the caretaker and the Gran.
(Stealth +14, boy howdy)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-23 07:41:08)

*Obi-Wan Kenobi…I know I have heard that name somewhere…*
Not able to ge the familarity of the name Jett just mentioned out of his head, Neeman ushers the kids inside. Once done, he moves to Viqi.
"So, whatÂ´s going on?"
((Knowledge(Galactic Lore) +7 to identify the name of Obi-Wan Kenobi. If I can take 10 IÂ´ll do that, Neeman should have travelled around in an era where tales of the Clone Wars and the Jedi Generals should still be common))

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-30 19:51:23)

Aiden becomes oblique to that of being able to hide from the shadows but as he watches and listens he feels something telling him he has found his path.... (ooc: Lucky Roll *Shakes Fist*) (Destiny Bonus +1 to Defenses for 24 Hours to Aiden and Close Allies)
Neeman thoughts bring him to a General Kenobi he heard of during the Clone Wars...Some sort of Hero Jedi but he was suppose to be dead like most all Jedi as they were branded as traitors before the end of the war by the Emperor and Senate.
Viqi: "I need you to take Aiden and the Droids beyond the dune sea and Obi-Wan will tell you where to go from there...."
Viqi reaches into the little bag she has always carried with her on her backside, though you never recall her ever pulling anything from there or using it for that matter. She takes out a cylinder like object and hands it to Neeman.
Viqi: "Give this to Obi-Wan and tell him Aiden may not be ready for it but he may have no choice....he will know the meaning..."
Viqi show a great sadness one that neither of you have seen before and it seems as if she could shatter but knowing her she would not let you see that happen.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-12-31 18:56:26)

As the conversation between Viqi and Neeman progresses, the young Miralukan boy becomes increasingly upset, the thought of separating from Viqi causing him more hurt then he cared to admit.
"So that's how it is, ya old mynock?! Just ship me off to some Old Ben Kenobber in the middle of the Wastes without a blink?"
Qur'aiden strides from his hiding place, shaking an accusatory finger at the older woman. The gesture would be somewhat intimidating if not for the boy's small stature and the tearful quaver to his voice. He scrubs tears from the bandage covering his eyes with the back of his hand.
"Well that suits me just fine! Qur the Quick don't need nobody what don't want him neither!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-01 02:22:56)

Viqi walks over to the tearfully upset Aiden and kneels down to hold him. She softly talks into his ear.
Viqi: "Aiden I need you to promise me, a promise you have to keep to me no matter what, you must not give into your anger and pain when you find out why I sent you away....but you will leave tomorrow you will find out why....so promise me and I will no longer treat you as a child..."
Viqi stands up from the Aiden and walks out to face the endless view of dunes.
Viqi: "Neeman...Aiden...please head inside you only have a couple hours till sunrise, I will have the speeder ready for you...."

---

### **Anazider** (2009-01-04 17:28:20)

The miralukan lad sobers up with a noisy sniffle. He puts on his cockiest grin, which likely hasn't its usual effect, given the circumstances.
"Qur the Quick don't get mad; he gets even! And ya should treat me like a man, 'cause that's what the nerf I am!"
Aiden puffs out his chest, much like a peacock, but the feigned bravado soon evaporates and his shoulders slump.
"...But I promise. I know I ain't been one much for doing like ya ask, but... I'll make a concession this *one* time."
With that he darts in for a quick hug on the woman, just as quickly stepping back and studiously adjusting the tatters that serve as his clothing, looking embarrassed for himself. Soon he turns around and marches back into the sunken den, making for bed.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-06 08:37:17)

Waiting until Aiden was back inside the house before speaking, Neeman looks to the small cylinder object Viqi gave to him.
"General Kenobi, Jedi hero during the Clone Wars, and presumed dead in the same war. IÂ´ve heard the stories about him. And you are telling me that he is alive?"
Taking a deep breath, and pocketing the item.
"WeÂ´ll leave first thing in the morning, you take care of your children now"
Giving the old woman a hug, he moves over to the two droids.
"Go inside, and be ready to depart in the morning"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-06 22:13:36)

C-3PO: " Of course Sir, I am quite sorry we have cause your friend such distress...C'mon R2 lets go.."
The Two Droids head inside. Viqi watches as everyone heads in then looks over at the Debri covering Aiden's Speeder Bike.
Viqi smiles and as the others are out of sight she waves her over the debris and the stones rise and seem to pile into a mound. As the stones settle the Speeder Bike seems to move inside the Workshop by it's self. Viqi follows it inside and disappears into the workshop for the night.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-11 15:10:59)

After sending the droids inside, Neeman starts to walk away from the building. He probably wonÂ´t be able to get much sleep a night like this anyway, so he might as well sit outside and think a bit. As he has walked a bit away from the place, he hears the sound of moving stone. He takes a few steps back, and sees how the stones that had covered the speeder seems to move away almost of their own will. He raises an eyebrow as the bike itself lifts from the ground and moves inside the workshop. All the time, Viqi just stands there, her back towards him.
Deciding not to press matters in the night, he moves to a small sand dune just outside of ViqiÂ´s place and sits down. Things just took a very large turn from how they used to be. He pulls out the small cylinder Viqi gave him and looks it over. He had heard stories in his travels of course, and there were only a few people in the Galaxy who could make things move of their own. And with that knowledge, he could only guess what the item he was holding was.
Suddenly, the woman he had known as his closest friend and family all his life seemed like so much more. And he was sure the weirdness wouldnÂ´t end tonight. After all, she had just sent him to talk to a Jedi Knight who served in the Clone Wars...one who was supposed to be dead.
He wrapped his cloak tighter around him, placed his rifle where he could reach it, and looked out into the Tatooine night.
((Perception +7, Darkvision and no penalty for the first 50 squares. I took the liberty of saying that I autosucceeded on any Knowledge(Galactic Lore) check required to know those things. I figured theyÂ´d be DC 15 tops, and I have a result of 17 when taking 10))

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-11 19:04:35)

The Night is silents, Neeman sitting atop the his dune only sees a  couple of womprats running of in the distance, most like they were disturbed by the Escape Pods crash.
The nigh slowly becomes day and from the workshop Neeman can see from the side that Viqi has taken out her Land Speeder for them to travel on their trip. She leaves it running as she heads over to Neeman.
Viqi: " It's time.....please see if Aiden and the Droids are ready to go....and tell Repal I need to speak with him."

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-11 19:16:21)

Having barely gotten any sleep, Neeman yawns and rises as Viqi approaches him.
"Sure. Droids can usually be trusted to do as theyÂ´re told, and I suppose Aiden will stick to his word as well"
Moving closer to Viqi, he reveals the cylinder objects he has been looking at on and off during the night.
"I had no idea...is it yours?"

---

### **Anazider** (2009-01-11 22:50:33)

Aiden comes straggling up the stairs and out of the recessed home. He loudly smacks his lips, interrupting Viqi and Neeman's conversation as he slugs about, leaning on his staff.
"Ain't been up this early since... Well since somethin' I ain't gonna incriminate myself over."
He shuffles over to where his swoop resides, patting it gently and brushing away left over bits of dust and debris from the events the night before.
"Don't know how ya did it, but... much obliged ol' gal!" The youth bows mockingly to Viqi before nimbly climbing into the saddle of the overworked vehicle.
"All right, lets kick this Reek!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-12 14:43:56)

Repal shambled out of the building after Aiden.  He'd barely managed to sleep after all the exitement the night before.  Hearing the landspeeder running, he went to investigate, unaware of the events that took place after he had went inside.
"Are you leaving already, Neeman?" he asked, still not completely awake.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-12 16:33:41)

"Just going for a little ride Repal"
Looking over at Viqi again, he smiled at her.
"No matter who you have been, i know who you *are*. WeÂ´ll be back soon"
Moving to get Aiden and the droids loaded up and ready to go, he cries back towards Repal.
"Repal, your mother wants to talk to you!"

The grumpy youth swats Neeman away, shooing him and the droids towards Viqi's landspeeder while maintaining his perch upon the powerful swoop bike. Indeed, the repulsor craft looks massive in comparison to Qur'Aiden, but he doesn't look daunted in the least bit.
"Yeah Repal, gonna part out them droids and get me a new accelerator coil for the Nebula Blazer. See how ya like that!" Showing his immaturity, the Miralukan sticks his tongue out at Repal, but it lacks his usual zeal.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-14 17:54:38)

Neeman just shakes his head at Aiden. But, he supposes, he is still a kid.
*At least for now…but who knows what will happen when we reach Obi-Wan*
Ushing the two droids up on the speeder, he jumps in at the pilots seat, and waits to see if Viqi has any final words before they take off.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-14 22:02:09)

The droids loaded up on the speeder seem silent but ready to go. Viqi walks over to Neeman and speaks softly to him.
Viqi: "Neeman I know he maybe a troublesome child but please watch out for him....I will miss you both greatly and hope you both will remember me, as I will never forget you all..."
Viqi hands Neeman a Datapad
Viqi: " This is very important but you mustn't read it until after Obi-Wan has decided what best to do next.....you'd best be on your way before a storm comes along."
Viqi smiles as she steps back with Repal and the others.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-14 22:06:45)

Neeman takes the datapad and nods.
"We wonÂ´t be gone long, weÂ´ll be back here pretty soon"
Saying goodbye to all the others, Neeman looks over to Aiden.
"Are you ready kid? DonÂ´t fall behind"
He kicks in the accelerator, and the speeder takes off.

---

### **Anazider** (2009-01-14 22:39:39)

"Don't fall behind... Well ain't that cute... Kriffin' smart-mouthy..."
Aiden reaches into a saddlebag haphazardly strapped to the swoop bike, coming up with a leather flight cap with a pair of weather-worn goggles attached to them. The youth crams the cap onto his head, taking a moment to adjust the fit of the rather-useless goggles (even more so given the rags covering his eyes), before gunning the throttle, easy catching up with the more mundane-sounding landspeeder.

Coming over the crest of a dune, Kaleb finally made out the house in the distance. The previous day, Kaleb had gone into town to visit with Nyyv, and old Sullustan trader who sometimes had new datacards for him. Kaleb had spent the majority of the day helping old Nyyv fix up some of his labor droids. When he'd been about ready to leave, he caught sight of Ariq and his gang. Ariq was a big human. Dumb too (from Kaleb's point of view). Normally, Kaleb walked around with Repal to make sure that Ariq didn't cause him trouble. But, Kaleb had spent so much time helping out Nyyv and getting his new datacard, he'd completely lost track of time and not noticed when Repal left to go home.
Kaleb had managed to avoid the bullies, but hiding from them had cost him precious travel time out of town and he knew better than to walk the dunes at night. So, Kaleb had spent the night at Nyyv's place (he had long since copied Nyyv's access key) and set out first thing in the morning.
Coming over the hill, Kaleb fingered the new datacard in his hand. Nyyv had said that it was supposed to have the blueprints for an Incom T-43 on it. While that wasn't as cool as the newer T-47s, Kaleb valued his newest treasure. He just imagined how much the others would love to have an actual airspeeder. Of course, there was the problem of finding sufficient materials to build the thing, but that was merely details. Another detail was getting Viqi to give him back his datapad after that detonite incident. Maybe he should let her know that he needed his datapad to read the blueprints of an airspeeder that Aiden was no doubt going to use to endanger his and the other's lives. Maybe not.
As he continued thinking about these things, he realized that, in the distance next to the house, were two speeders with people on them, seemingly ready to go. He thought one of them might be the Nebula Blazer, but it was hard to tell.
(Perception +8 at 50 squares [ie. -25 penalty])
But, where would Aiden be going at this hour? He never got up this early. And, who was that in Viqi's speeder?
Kaleb doubled his speed, determined to find out what was going on.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-15 19:26:55)

Repal waved lazily as Aiden and Neeman left, and then noticed in the distance Kaleb.  He sluggishly shifted from waving goodbye to waving hello.
After he was finished, he turned to Viqi.
"Neeman said you wanted me.  What for?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-15 22:49:52)

Viqi: "Repal I contacted Diego and Tebb about a matter I needed taken care of, if you wouldn't mind I need you and Kaleb to  take Ala and Jett with you, Diego should be here shortly."
Kaleb can't quite make out who was in the Land Speeder but notices Aiden on the Nebula Blazer. In the distance to Kaleb's right side he hears another speeder approaching.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-15 23:50:54)

*That has to be Aiden.* Kaleb thinks to himself. *That's obviously the Nebula Blazer, and Aiden doesn't let anyone drive his swoop except him. But, who's taking Viqi's land speeder?*
Kaleb tries waving, but he doesn't know if Aiden even sees him as he flies off. He turns back towards the house and returns Repal's wave.
After a couple more steps, Kaleb stops and turns to the right as he hears a speeder approaching.
*First, Aiden leaves with somebody at an unseemly hour, and now someone's coming to visit? Who'd come visit us?*
(Perception +8)
Kaleb hurries to reach the house.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-17 00:21:51)

"Alright," Repal says, though there is some doubt as to whether he consciously registered it; he was still very tired from lack of sleep.
"Can I get something to eat first?"

Coroo yawned, as she dragged her booted feet thought the dust and sand that covered the street. Her twin heavy blaster pistols slapped against her hips as she moved gracefully towards the home she shared with the other strays that Vigi had picked up over the years.
The female Zabrak had been working the night shift at the local spaceport, which had been fairly boring, Until the Imperials decided to commandeer it for they're operations. She didn't know what was so important even though she had seen some of the footage of the battle that took place over head.
"Now, what the heck is going on!?" she cries out, just before walking into the back of the Airspeeder.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 21:13:31)

The Land Speeder that had arrived at Viqi's engines hum. Diego opens the door to his expensive speeder.
Diego: "Hey Coroo, help me load the kids we ain't got a lot of time."
Diego seems quite rushed and worried
Diego: "Repal, Kaleb, Ala and Jett get in the speeder on the double!"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 21:41:08)

Kaleb finishes his trot up to the house as Diego gets out of his speeder. He heard Diego saying something to Coroo about loading the kids up.
*Well,* Kaleb thinks. *If I'm going to be riding somewhere for awhile, maybe Viqi'll let me have my datapad back so I can read my datacard.*
"Morning Coroo," Kaleb says cheerfully as he jogs past her towards Viqi.
"Viqi. Any chance I might get my datapad back? You know, so I don't get bored on whatever outing we're going on?"
Kaleb tries to look as sweet and innocent as he can.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 22:00:32)

Viqi looks down at Kaleb and smiles.
Viqi: "I am sorry Kaleb I lent your Datapad to Neeman, he will give it to you later.....I think you better hurry along."
Viqiq puts her hand on top of Kalebs head.
Viqi:" Please try not to blow yourself up or the others....I won't be around to help you fix it any.."
Viqi pauses and sighs
Viqi: "I have your things packed up Jett is coming with them now."
Jett Appears from the Living Area of the Underground dome with some bags, struggling with them as he walks over.
Jett: "Hey somebody help me with these I'm not as strong as Repal you all know!"

---

### **Avarna** (2009-01-18 22:07:26)

Coroo scratched her neck, just below the ear, before letting out another yawn. She shrugged when she noticed the others already coming out of the house. She waved lazily to Diego, "Sure, just let me go get the shock prod."
"Good night, Keleb." She replied, slipping past the others. She didn't know when it was decided to go on a field trip, but at the moment she only wanted to spend some quality time in her bed.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 22:14:27)

Kaleb's face falls as he hears that his datapad is elsewhere.
*This is going to be a boring trip.* Kaleb thinks as he turns towards Jett walking out of the house.
"Here Jett. Let me help you with those." Kaleb walks over to help his often partner in sabotage with the luggage.
(Perception +8 to realize that there was more to the situation than Viqi's saying)

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 22:19:45)

Viqi: "Coroo, Jett is also carrying your luggage....you won't be sleeping here."
Viqi says this with a stern look, not letting on the real reason of why but she cared for her and did not want her to stay.
Diego: " C'mon you rug-rats we don't have time for this, we have to get you to the transport....the Captain isn't exactly patient!"

---

### **Avarna** (2009-01-18 22:34:25)

Coroo's heart sank, was the kindly Matron simply kicking them all out? For what other reason would there be such a mass exodus from the only home many of them had ever know. She looked Viqi in the eyes, and tried to memorize every detail of her face. For some reason she got the feeling she'd never see the woman again.
"Very well." Without another word, She climbed into the speeder. And tried to push her lethargy aside.
(UTF +8 Force Trance)

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 22:42:38)

Repal recognizes the urgency in the air.  He grabs what luggage he could and jumped into the speeder.
"What's going on, Viqi?" he asked, "Why are we in such a rush?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 22:59:26)

Kaleb finishes helping Jett with his share of the luggage and hops in the back seat of the speeder.
*So, from sleeping at Nyyv's to not sleeping at home.* Kaleb wants to ask more questions, but he knows better than to argue with Viqi while she's wearing that stern of a face.
After climbing into the speeder, Kaleb waves to Viqi through the window.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-18 23:13:19)

Sitting in the speeder, Neeman watches Aiden blast by him. He doesnÂ´t react though, choosing to let the youngster do as he pleases. Instead he turns to the two droids with him.
"So, really, what happended to you two before you crashed over at Viqis place? And whatÂ´s this with you seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi. You know him?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-18 23:48:46)

C-3PO: " I am sorry Master Neeman but I have no idea who this Obi-Wan is, but R2 simply insists that he has an urgent message for him, but then I think R2 thinks far too much for a simple Mechanic."
R2-D2 whistles a bit, most likely a few insults to C-3PO as they ride along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Ala and Jett hop into the Speeder they seems to be under the impression Viqi is sending them on a vacation.
Deigo starts the speeder and heads towards the city with a turn of the wheel.
Ala: "So why is Momma not coming on the trip with us? Does she not like to travel?"
Diego seems worried and doesn't respond to Ala's Question.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-19 00:06:50)

"Well, if he indeed is alive, we should be with him shortly. But you still havenÂ´t answered my first question, who are you really, and how come you crashed an escape pod on our home?"

---

### **Anazider** (2009-01-19 16:52:57)

Aiden spends much of the trip playing with the overly-aspirated swoop bike, the repulsorcraft's engine singing despite the battered appearance. He intermittently guns the throttle in low gear, sending the bike into a near vertical stand on its rear lift, kicking up small sand clouds. The youth holds the lift-stand for as long as he can before expertly setting the nose of the craft down.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-01-21 08:22:29)

"Ala," Coroo says patting the seat next to her in the back of the speeder. When the young girl complied with the silent request, the Zabrak wrapped her arms around her in a hug. Taking a deep breath as she tries to figure out what to say. "Viqi loves us all very much. That's why Neeman and I keep coming back. But this time is different, This time we won't be able to come back. But "mother" needs to stay, so she can take in other lost children."

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-21 09:59:39)

Repal watches the landscape go by for a while, but eventually turns to Deigo.
"Viqi said something about Tebb.  What's going on here, Deigo?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-21 15:55:58)

Diego: "Yeah, Tebb has some friends that are gonna be taking you all in for awhile..."
In the Speeder, Diego Security Comm Link starts to click as an incoming message.
??? : " Diego the Imperials are heading out, I assume you know where they are going since you asked me to let you know.....they were asking about Viqi and something about some Droids...you better watch yourself kid."
Diego answered the Com
Diego: " Keep me informed...."

Kaleb perks up at the mention of Viqi and imperials. Kaleb tries to think what imperials would want with Viqi.
(Knowledge [Bureaucracy] +9)
He sits up and looks at Diego.
"What's going on, Diego?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-21 23:27:13)

Diego: "The Imperials want those Droids that crashed out at your place...."
Diego sighs as if he knows he is gonna regret something.
Diego: "....Viqi was afraid that they would "remove" anyone who might know too much about them..."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile R2 signals Neeman and C-3PO
C-3PO: "Pardon Master Neeman but R2 says we have arrived close to the location, I advise we stop and look before he does something dramatic."
The Landscape is Rocky and nothing but sand and some bones among them. There appears to be a small Canyon not to far from you but the terrain gives off a vibe that the bones are there for a reason.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-22 05:34:25)

Kaleb realizes what Diego's sentence really means.
"Then, we have to go back! We have to get her out of there!"

### **Avarna** (2009-01-22 09:52:31)

"And do what Kaleb?" Coroo replied from her spot in the back seat. Hugging Ala a little tighter, the Zabrak woman seemed to sink into her seat. It wasn't easy playing the Big Sister to a group of children as diverse as the ones taken in by Viqi, but someone has to.
"All we'd end up doing at this point, is handing the droids over to the Empire. Deigo if you turn this speeder around, you might as well put a bow on them." When the speeder comes to a stop, Coroo is one of the first out the door.
(Perception +7, w/ reroll)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-22 11:52:58)

"Dramatic? HeÂ´s an astromech droid. Just relax, if we are close to Obi-Wan, he will know it, and will hopefully contact us"
He looks around, scanning the area.
"Off course, if we are getting close, it might be a good idea to bring that blasted kid in. Aiden! get over here, now!"
((Perecption +7, Target Awareness))

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-22 18:52:32)

Kaleb sits dejected in his seat. He know's Coroo is right. What good would a couple of kids be?
*I wish I had my datapad and a computer terminal. Maybe then I could reroute the troopers somewhere else. Like over the side of Begger's Canyon.* Kaleb thinks to himself.

---

### **Anazider** (2009-01-22 19:32:25)

Qur'aiden ranges a bit further away from where Neeman has stopped before looping back around, making sure to stop abruptly enough that the Gran and the droids are dusted in a light coating of sand.
"Viqi always said Please and Thank You were the keys to gettin' what you want, not Now. Ain't you learn nothin' growing up?" Seeming rather pleased with himself, Aiden spins a circle in the sand as if looking around at the surroundings.
"And I don't see no Old Ben Kenobber! You sure this is the right place?!" The youth shoots an accusatory glance at both Neeman and the two droids.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-23 05:43:25)

"Well kid, when you grow up youÂ´ll find that the world outside of Tatooine plays by somewhat different rules than Viqi has taught you. Besides, donÂ´t she use to tell you to be nice to your elders?"
He turns to look at R2 in the back of the speeder.
"The little droid says weÂ´re getting close to where heÂ´s supposed to be, so I figured weÂ´d slow down a bit and see if we couldnÂ´t find him"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-23 20:47:07)

Kaleb starts to get agitated.
"Hey, Diego. How much longer is this ride?"

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-24 18:09:40)

As Diego ignores the question and time rolls by you notice your in a city environment, it appears to be Mos Eisley.
Diego: "Ok kids we are here, we are gonna drop you all off at a safe house, while I go look for Tebb so we can go meet up with this Captain."
Diego takes the Speeder to a far end of the city, he pull up to a building which look as if it is need of major repair.
Diego: "Ok kids here it is.....kinda reminds me Aiden for some reason..."

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-24 18:32:24)

Kaleb gets out and looks at the crumbling building.
"Well, maybe I can busy myself making some improvements on this place. Do they have a computer in here?"

### **Anazider** (2009-01-24 18:46:53)

"Nice is for suckers and people what can afford it!" Aiden pipes up, sloughing his way through the heavy sand towards the Canyon. He flips up the goggles of his flight cap, using a hand to shield where his eyes would be with an exaggerated gesture.
"What're you think these bones are from?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-24 20:51:59)

Repal exits the speeder, a look of worry over his face.  He says nothing, but he is actually quite concerned.  Things seemed to be happening, and somehow Tebb had become involved.  The Bothan wasn't exactly young, and Repal wondered if he could even manage a trip from his house anymore.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-25 02:28:26)

"I donÂ´t know really, but IÂ´m guessing maybe a Krayt Dragon or some other native predator of Tatooine"
Moving the speeder slowly forward, Neeman looks around, trying to find some place where a man would live.
"R2, you wouldnÂ´t happen to have more exact details, would you?"

---

### **Avarna** (2009-01-27 17:01:27)

"Deigo, its far to dangerous here to go alone. I'm going with you to meet this Captain." Coroo tells the him with a scowl, and proceeds to climb back into the Speeder. Honestly, Who in they're right mind would wander Mos Eisley alone. By habit she double checked that her heavy blasters were still on her belt.

R2 whistles and heads off into the small canyon. Neeman notices along with the bones recent tracks but they seem to be old...but their don't seem to be track heading out.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Diego sighs unsure of whether he should take Coroo or leave her with the kids.
Deigo: " Its your choice Coroo but if you go I suggest we don't take too long the kids might get into trouble....as usual..."

---

### **Avarna** (2009-01-27 21:46:40)

Coroo took a deep breath, only now noticing that Neeman and Aiden had disappeared. Once more climbing out of the speeder, she places a hand on Kaleb's shoulder. She then turned her attention back to Diego, and flashes him a smile. "Then I suggest you step on it."

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-28 23:31:00)

Kaleb's head jerks up at the mention of "trouble".
"What!?" Kaleb puts an innocent smile on his face. "One small crater and they NEVER trust you again!" He throws his hands up in the air to emphasize his point.
"And look! I'm not even carrying any explosives this time." Kaleb points at his obviously detonator-less belt.

---

### **Anazider** (2009-01-29 00:25:18)

Aiden continues to kick up clouds of sand as he shuffles after the diminutive astromech droid. He walks the swoop bike along next to him, but he finds it difficult to do as he has to stand on his toes while constantly sinking into the dunes.
"You sure you know where you're going, lunchbox?" The brash miralukan calls out to R2, his voice carrying over the endless desert wastes.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-31 22:35:35)

As R2 spins his head around to answer a loud yelling comes from further in, the yelling however is not human....
Aidens sensed some life from the valley but couldn't tell how much of it was possibly wild life.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diego turns the speeder around and heads back into town, leaving all of you in front of the two story building. The aliens and traders around looking at you are not sure of why your their and some don't seem to care as the others just go back to their business some however seem to continue watching you all.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-01 08:28:08)

Seeing the speeder head off in the distance, Kaleb sighs and turns to the building.
"Well, I guess we go inside and wait."
(muttered under his breath)
"I bet they don't even have a dataport."

### **Avarna** (2009-02-01 17:30:17)

"I'll believe your not carrying explosives, about the same time I'm taking a swim." Coroo replies sarcastically, as she herds the younger children inside.
"Kaleb, why don't you tell Jett and Ala a story. Like the time Aiden road his swoop too close to the Sarlacc." The female zabrak asked, hoping to keep them all distracted long enough for her to resume napping.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-01 21:17:45)

Repal chuckled as he walked inside.
"I haven't thought about that one in a while," he says.
"You know, with all the things that poor bike's been through, I'm surprised its still in one piece."

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-02 05:42:15)

"Hey!" Kaleb put on an insulted look. "Aiden and I keep that swoop in pristine condition, thank you very much! Besides, with all the extra power we've given that thing, no way a nerfin' sarlac's gonna get its jaws around Aiden. And that's on top of Aiden being one of the best swoop pilots around!"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-02 11:31:32)

"Oh, great, you had to leave the speeder hadnÂ´t you?"
Neeman mutters under his breath as he grabs his rifle in one hand and jumps out of the speeder. Before moving after the small astromech, he turns around to C-3PO.
"Now at least *you* stay in the speeder, okay?"
Taking a jogging pace, he moves up towards R2.

### **Anazider** (2009-02-02 17:25:17)

Qur'aiden sneezes loudly and then wipes his nose with the back of his hand, grumbling the whole while about people talking about him.
He frowns at the valley and is about to speak when the inhuman yell causes him to pull up short.
"I knew it, that garbage pail was sent here to get us in an Ambush! C'mon Neeman, lets go back. Whatever that was, it probably already ate Old Ben Kenobber as an appetizer, and I don't feel like being the main course!"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-02 18:14:42)

"Stay here if you wish Aiden, IÂ´ll have a look"
Moving up to R2, Neeman snuck(sp?) forward to try and see what was making the sound.

---

### **Anazider** (2009-02-06 23:07:46)

"Viqi'd never forgive me if I just let you get ate..."
Qur'aiden grumbled and applied the swoop's brakes, bringing the bike to a standstill. He activated the crafts minor security system, them tromped after the Gran.
"...Still don't mean *I'ma* get ate. I'll be sure to scream real convincin' like when I jet out of here to tell the old shrew what happened."

As Neeman moves up to R2 he seems to disappear from Aiden's senses.
As Neeman comes up to R2, who is edging himself over the hill to peer down the path, Neeman and R2 see a group of 3 Sand People seeming unaware of the two of them.
As Aiden approaches to R2 he suddenly feels a presence behind him and C-3PO yells out to him
C-3PO " OH DEAR LOOK OUT MASTER AIDEN!!"

Reaching up to the droid, Neeman steps in front of it to slow it down.
"And where do you think youÂ´re going?"
He drops into a crouch as he spots three Sand People on the path down below. Motioning for R2 to get back towards the speeder, he is interrupted by 3POÂ´s scream, and as he swings around and almost on instinct raises his rifle and fires a single shot as h screams.
"Aiden!"

Aiden attempts to fend the Tusken Raider off with a wild swing of his walking stave, stumbling and rolling backwards over the sand dune as he scampers for his swoop bike
Once back at the repulsorcraft, he leaps onto the saddle and begins the ignition sequence, the tricky starter giving him trouble at a most inopportune moment.
"Of all the kriffin' times... C'mon, damn you!"

In Mos Eisley
Repal looks around the first floor, the buildings interior was ravaged the floor had stains which most likely was long dried blood, the walls had seemingly deteriorated due to the lack of up keeping. As Repal notices a unique floor pattern....it almost appears to be a Hatch of some kind.
Kaleb looks around and finds a terminal in the back room.....along with two force cages which one of them appears to be in use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Sand Dunes
ooc: I assume you took the Surprise Round DA?
The Large and Lanky Tusken Raider takes the shot in the chest but is still standing though anyone could tell he is badly wounded.
Two of the Tusken Raiders have made it half way up the hill to Neeman, as they are aware of his presence.
Aiden barely avoids the Tusken Raider swing his Gaffi Stick at him, but manages to get to his bike.
The last Tusken Raider in the Valley tries to take a shot towards Neeman and R2 but due to luck or the Tuskens horrible skill, he misses and simply shoots the ridge.
R2 whistles at Neeman in distress as the other Two Tuskens are getting closer.
The Tusken Raider that Aiden managed to slip by seems to have lost his courage and runs the best he can out into the Dunes.

Kaleb walks into the back room and almost shouts for joy as he sees the computer terminal. As he walks towards it, he notices the force cage humming in the corner. Turning to the side, he walks a little closer to the cage to see if anyone is inside.
"Hello? Is anyone in there? Do you speak Basic? <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Huttese?

Jawa?

(Perception check +8 to see if anyone is inside the force cage. If so, what species?)

In Mose Eisley
Kaleb notices that the prisoner is a Both, an elderly one at that, sitting in the Force Cage.
The Old Bothan looks up towards you but his eyes don't seem right to you (Kaleb)
Old Bothan: " My names is Tebb Fallon and yes I can Speak most all those languages, but lets keep it at Basic shall we?"
Tebb: "Is Repal with you by chance?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-14 23:58:09)

Kaleb looks down at the old Bothan in surprise.
"**You're Tebb?**" turning towards the doors, Kaleb hollers back out of the room. "REPAL! COROO! I THINK I FOUND TEBB!"
Turning back towards the Bothan, "Don't worry old man, we'll get you out of there in a second." Kaleb starts searching for the remote.
(Perception check +8 to look for the remote. Figured with Know (tech) +9, he'd know about a force cage, but it could be rolled if you want.)

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-15 00:09:33)

Kaleb can't find any remote in the room, but however due to his Tech Knowledge he thinks that the Terminal in the room maybe linked to them in some fashion, if maybe as a relay of some sort.
Tebb: " I think the more pressing issue is that your all in as much trouble as I am young one....which by the way which child of Viqi's are you?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-15 00:14:46)

Kaleb looks at the old Bothan in the cage. Deciding that since he knew Repal by name, he'd probably be trustworthy."
"I'm the one that can get you out of there. Name's Kaleb. I'm the one that helps Aiden keep his swoop in order."
Moving to the computer (as Kaleb has a feeling he should check it out), Kaleb activates it and tries to find a way to turn off the force cage.
(Use computer +14 to disable the force cage)

"Tebb?" Coroo asked, as she stood up. Walking directly to the Force Cages she saw the bothan. "Kark!"
Drawing both her blasters, she dashed to the doorway, and started keeping a look out for trouble. "Kaleb, Repal break down those Force Cages, we can sell them for good Cred. "We're all Viqi's charges, that's enough for now."
(Perception +7 with reroll)

Still typing furiously away at the entry pad on the terminal, Kaleb shouts over his shoulder:
"Still got to get that one turned off first, oh great one!"

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-15 00:34:39)

Despite the Terminal treating Kaleb as an Unauthorized user, Kaleb seeming finds a backdoor into the program and disables the program that give the terminal access to the Force Cages and also Kaleb notices that it disabled an alarm to notify use: Diego06, possibly giving you an element of surprise.
Coroo peers out the (ooc: I assume that Main Doorway into the Building?) door and watches as smalls crowds go by about their business, however a sentry droid seems to be patrolling back and forth on the street.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-15 00:40:23)

Kaleb jumps up as the force cage powers down.
"That's right you dumb ol' machine! No one and no thing stands up against Kaleb the Great!"
Looking down at the screen, Kaleb's smile spreads even further.
"I even bi-passed the lame security program set to alert..." Kaleb's smile disappears in an instant.
"Oh frak! OH FRAK! **OH FRAK! COROO! REPAL! WE GOTTA GO! NOW!**"

---

### **Avarna** (2009-02-15 00:49:24)

Coroo watched the sentry droid for a few moments. "Kaleb, calm down. Shouting isn't going to help us."
"The front door is being monitored. Some explaining would be nice about now, Tebb." She waited for the droid to reach the closest point in its pattern, before firing a single blaster bolt at it.

Aiden holds the break but gasses the engine, the swoop bikes powerful repulsors kicking up a large cloud of sand and creating an awful racket; the youngster's intent.
**"You kriffin' dust suckers get away from Tri-ball!"**
Releasing the break, the swoop catapults across the sands, raising a long dust curtain in its wake. He expertly maneuvers the speeder-bike towards the Gran, seemingly gunning straight for him.
**"Jump on damn it!"**

Kaleb turns as he hears the blaster bolt ring out. He runs over towards Coroo, being careful to stay far enough back so he doesn't get in her way.
"Coroo, what's going on? What are you shooting at?"
Looking over at the deactivated force cages, Kaleb has an idea.
(Knowledge (technology) +9 to see if it's possible to dismantle the cages and turn them into electrified barricades for the door(s).)
(If that is true, then the following statement:)
"Coroo, would it help if I dismantled the cages and jury rigged them so sat at the door and blocked entrance to the building?"
(Mechanics +14 to dismantle the cages and turn them into barricades)

(Man I've been busy today... look how much I've missed)
Repal was inspecting what appeared to be a hatch when he heard Kaleb call out.  He rushed into the room, a look of shock on his face at seeing Tebb in a cage.
Once the elderly Bothan was out, he went to make sure he was okay.
"What happened Tebb?  Who put you in there?"
Turning his head suddenly in response to the shot fired by Coroo, he calls to the others, "I think I found a hatch if we need a back door.

### **Avarna** (2009-02-15 22:16:02)

"No. I'm not going to get trapped in some underground tunnel, if its not just a cellar." Corro tells Repal as he comments about the hatch in the floor.  "Nor am I going to wait for someone to come back here with a squad of Stormies."
"We head to the spaceport. I have the access codes to any number of docking bays, and Kaleb can hack any navcomputer. We find something space worthy, and we take off. And I'm ready to shoot anyone trying to stop us."

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-15 22:23:34)

Kaleb turns to the computer terminal (assuming it's now friendly towards him) and tries to access the net to find out trooper movement patterns, thus plotting a path carefully to the spaceport. He also tries to get a heads up as to what's in port.

Watching the Tusken rock visibly from the impact, Neeman hears the grunt and howls of the two raiders behind him. Swinging around he drops into a crouching stance, and focuses his three eyes together, pinpointing the exact location of the opponents and pressing the trigger. Hearing the roar of AidenÂ´s swoop rushing for him, he makes a jump for it trying get onto the speeder.
