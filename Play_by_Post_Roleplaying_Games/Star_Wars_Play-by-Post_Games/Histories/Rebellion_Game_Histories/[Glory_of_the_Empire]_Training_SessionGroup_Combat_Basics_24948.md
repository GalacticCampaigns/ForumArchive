# [Glory of the Empire] Training Session:Group Combat Basics

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-18 18:56:22)

*The last few months have been hard on Theta squad. In response to their performance on Barab I, they have been made to rehearse the basics of group combat, training on coordination, supporting fire, and movement formations. The drills have been hard and tedious, but are in essence the core of the military tactics used by the Empire, and command wants them to be learned by heart.
Now, though, finally it seems like the training is coming to an end. An applied exercise has been prepared, that will put all you have learned the last few months to the test. Hopefully, after this, command will have an assignment for you that does not involve the Carida Academy.* 
It is late dusk, and Theta squad is assembled at the foot of one of two massive ridges making the walls of a long canyon. Almost the entire squad is assembled, Chaz recovered from the injuries sustained on Barab I. Beksus is still in recovery, however, which brings the squad to 7 troopers. A new recruit has been requested for transfer, but has yet to arrive.
Your commander, Jack, is standing off to the side, receiving orders via comlink from command.
((
Updates on NPCs, ranks, etc will follow soon, as will specific gear assignment for this mission.

After a couple of minutes, the sergeant rejoins the squad. He calls for all of you to gather around. Once everyone is gathered, he speaks, emphasizing his words with gestures.
**"Alright squad, listen up. At the peak of this ridge is located a small outpost held by the enemy. Intel provided designates it as primarily a lookout post, but even if they lack the weaponry, they likely won´t surrender, so we should expect a fight. We know there could be up to a dozen men manning the outpost at the same time, but fortunately they regularly sends out patrol into the surrounding areas, which should decrease the opposition quite a bit.
In about 1 standard hour, an enemy transport will pass through the canyon below the ridge. It will be an enemy prison transport, and it will hold two ISB agents that holds information vital to the Empire. Our objective is to seize the outpost, and stage an ambush of the transport to rescue the captive agents. Once they have been secured, we are to call for evac and extract from the area.
Any questions?"**
((
OK, for this assignment, you are given the exact gear from the stormtroopers in the SECR: Blaster Rifle, Stormtrooper Armor, Utility Belt(fully loaded) and a Frag Grenade. Other than that you will have to do with your wits and cunning for this one.

Nikki slaps a fresh power pack into his rifle and throws the switch to make it active and says, **"Sure. What are we waiting for?"** The cockiness in his voice is evident, he feels amazing. He'd always been in good shape but with his redoubled training during his downtime he has begun to feel even better. He'd had to adjust the fitting of his armor to make room for small bulk he had amassed, but even an eighth of an inch mattered amongst the best of the best. *Lets get this done, I'm ready for this training to be over, ready to get back to the action,* he thinks as he looks around the rest of squad, specifically at the newcomer.

**"Glad to see you so eager, ninety-nine. Let´s hope you remain that way. I would like to remind all of you, that even though this is an exercise, it is to be treated as the real deal. I know some of you are eager to get away from the training grounds, and on to a real assignment, but even though they´re not lethal, the weapons used in the training can mess you up something serious. And believe me, that will keep you away from active duty for an even longer period of time"**
Taking a moment to look around the squad to judge their status, the Sergeant seems pleased and points to Mal.
**"Form up. I want a single line, keeping at least 2 meters between each soldier, with you on the left flank. That´s the side where we don´t have the canyon, and the side where the enemy is most likely to come from. Keep your eyes open, or they could very well take us by surprise. Following from the left, I want Nikki, myself, Cam, Kirnos and Gavin. You´ll be keeping the right flank Chaz, and even though we don´t expect anything to come from there, I´ll throw you down myself if we are surprised from there. Everybody clear? Then let´s go"**
((
That´s that for the post. I´ll try to update the character sheet thread, rank thread, etc soon, and unless anyone has any comments on this post, I´ll move it forward tomorrow.

Without further questions, you spread out into the designated formation, and starts to move ahead, closing in on the peak of he ridge. You understands that this is not a covert operation but rather a full-scale assault. However, stealth still has many advantages, and the fact remains that you are going up against perhaps less armed and well-trained soldiers than yourself, but who still have the advantage of a prepared defensive position. So getting the jump on them would probably be rather useful.
You move carefully through the forest covering the most part of the ridge, with Mal cautiously spying to his left, keeping an eye out for any possible returning patrols heading up the ridge that way. The undergrowth is not very thick, and you can move pretty uninhibited. Thanks to the internal commlinks in your helmets, you can talk rather freely, though the Sergeant has ordered a comm silence on anything not related to the mission. As you move deeper through the forest, he orders a halt and calls you down into kneeling positions. In the distance, you can see the forest edge, and the gray duracrete walls of the outpost.
**"All right, target spotted. Estimated distance: 200 meters. Seems like they have cleared out a section of the forest outside the walls. Mal, I want you to move ahead towards the forest edge. Take your time to avoid notice, and find a good place to dig yourself in, where you can see both the outpost clearly and keep an eye on the path leading up to it"**
Waving a signal for Mal to get going he signaled the rest of the squad to stand put.
**"The rest of you, try to find yourselves a good spot where you can see the walls clearly, and stay put until further commanded. Be ready to advance or fire, depending on situation"**
((
Tell me if you think you´ll want a map, and I´ll see what I can do.

Nikki does as ordered and drops to his belly, crawling forward, making his way from cover to cover, looking for a good spot to watch from. Once he finds one, he sets up camp, laying out his rifle and grenade so they are with in easy reach.

Following orders, Mal moves forward, sneaking through the vegetation to find a good vantage spot that will allow him to keep track of both movements on the wall, and anyone approaching on the nearby path. As he gets closer, he spots a pair of guards moving atop the wall, blaster rifles in their hands. At the wall, he can spot a massive duracrete door of rather solid make, as the only breaks in the otherwise solid wall. About 30 meters ahead, he spots what would appear to be a good position for him. Although the vegetation seems to be breaking up a bit, making it more likely that he will be discovered.
As Mal reports back what he has discovered, the Sergeant signals the rest of you to move forward, to halt just at the end of the thicker vegetation, and take up firing positions there.
((
OK, some quick distances here. There is about 50 meters of empty space between the outpost and the forest edge. The first 50 meters of vegetation is rather light, but characters crouching or crawling can have Concealment, and there are a few trees to grant cover. Mal is just on the border of this area. The forest behind this (where the rest of you are), is covered in thicker forest which grants Total Concealment to all in it, and has plenty of trees to grant cover as well.
Any questions, just ask them

Nikki takes up his rifle and grenade and begins to move forward, staying in a low roadie run all the way to his appointed spot. As he reaches it he puts the grenade back in his utility belt and checks his rifle's charge for the third time. He sits down and puts his back to the tree with him facing the fortress. Elbows on knees, he lifts his rifle and checks that the stock is locked back, then sets it to his shoulder and checks his ranges and lines of fire, ready for what comes.
