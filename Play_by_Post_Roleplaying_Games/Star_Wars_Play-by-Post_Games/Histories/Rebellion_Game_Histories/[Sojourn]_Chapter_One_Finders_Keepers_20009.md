The last few days pass by as if in dream. The children Lyn`aris and Lahelas have never seemed happier then now. The two have even enrolled in a few on site courses provided by the farms protocol droid SBC-54. At the top of their class these children will now stand a chance after the horrific exodus they suffered.
The motherly Dosennaa spent the first day to herself in quite mourning over the loss of her husband. After a small funeral to which all where in attendance Dosennaa managed to keep her spirits high and continue on with the wonderful work at the orphanage, itâ€™s what Rasen would have wanted.
Bandous has stepped up to help out with the daily cores around the farm. Over the next few days his recovery is rapid and his skill with a moisture vaporator unparallel. You yourselves are given a lot of freedom around the farm to come and go as you please. The odd chore is handed your way, help prepare the meals, farm maintenance, and the random errand into town nothing to strenuous.
Though itâ€™s never been said both Deidra and Tar`ja realize the benefits of this small modest farm house. For the two girls Lyn`aris and Lahelas this could be the haven you could never provide. For the first day Dosennaa refuses to talk to anyone until after the funeral. On the second day she approaches Chase and asks about his time with Rasen. The pair sit on the edge of the farms roof feet hanging over the courtyard discussing the good times with Rasen. This effort towards Dosennaa goes a long way towards bringing back her spirits, once more she seems happy again. It is also on that day that Dosennaa mentions Kirn to Kasga, telling him of how the brave pilot helped her with some ruffians in town one day. She has helped him and his boys ever since a meal here place to rest, she has hopes to see them again and is very glad to meet Kirns little brother.
((If there is anything you want your characters doing during these few days write it in your post. This does not mean you finish your goals that will depend on what they are. You all gain one level for the prelude. I need PMs with your changes before you update your character sheets. If you wish to talk about your characters advancement by all means lets do so. Great job all on the prelude we have a very good story so far lets keep this going. ))

You find yourselves in the melt Down cafÃ© awaiting an associate of Dosennaa`s. Over the last few days you have been asked to run errands them almost always lead to this one cantina. Early this morning Dosennaa approached your group worried and unsure if she should ask such a favor of you all. â€œYou have helped out so much the last few days. I really hate to ask more of you but â€¦. we are in desperate need.â€ Dosennaa looked so worried but how could you say no to her. â€œYou will be approached by a friend at the Melt Down cafÃ© with further instructions. This errand will take you away from us. I do hope you find your way back â€¦ find your way home.â€
The Melt Down cafÃ© a small cantina favored for its edge of town location. Outside speeders park randomly in front and to the side of the building at times creating a haphazard obstacle to the entryway. Above the arched entryway the sign rests half hung and tilted. Energy pulses throughout the sign in constant glow, it also showers sparks into the nearby alley. Even from the street various alcoholic odors and soft music emit adding to the establishments advertising. Inside the small cantina has a rounded bar in the middle of the common room. Tables of randomly assembled materials are spread out around the bar. To the sides of the circular room individual semi private booths are build into the stone wall, all with sheer crimson drapes for partition.
The patrons themselves resemble the establishment. Most locals and many of them regulars to the side Tomaw sleeps soundly. Around the rather bulky Ithorian flyâ€™s buzz around his head if it where not for his snoring you would never no he was asleep as his eyes reveal a glazed stare into nothingness.
Close by a trio of obviously underage local teens with fake ID`s sit giggling. The bar tender a near human with six arms never cared much for ID legal drinking age only credits. The trio toss spit balls at Tomaw as they have created a rather large pile on his back they have found this game very amusing.
At the far and of the common room Gartug sits drinking alone as usual. The scared Gammorean continues to chug down drink after drink. No one bothers to mediate his drinking no one ever attempts to converse with the seasoned pit fighter. Few sit close to him and those that are keep a nervous watch on the brute.
Within one of the private booths a rapid game of Sabacc continues into its second hour. Down to three a local Bothan card shark named Tav Ab`loon a Quarren land owner named Seggen and a visiting transport captain of Sullustan decent named Syan Teb battle each other for both winnings and a little prestige.
The last occupied table caters to a pair of visiting Trandosians. One thin for their race but wiry looking, the other lager with a single fang over bite. Both are well armed but keep to themselves as they nurse a few drinks. The pair have been using this cantina to meet with contacts.
On the single stage set within the common area a band of Cereans play a variety of instruments on a repeating rhythmic pattern. They are not very good but set the area up for the day time entertainment. The cantina has three waiters/waitress, the bar tender who pours multiple drinks simultaneously with his many arms. A lazy local girl who spends most of her time flirting with the customers and a silver protocol droid who only recently began work here.
With Dosennaa`s connections to the cantinas owner your group is always provided with a side booth for free, though you are expected to pay for your own consumption. Dosennaa`s instructions where vague which is unusual for the Bimm woman. You where told only to sit for a while someone would approach you when the time was right. You where also told to bring all of your belongings and so you sit together sharing a few quite glances while sipping your drinks awaiting a possible visit.
((Write your posts in some ways I have given you a lot to work with in other ways not much. Post what you can while you wait and we will continue.))

Tar'ja sits in the booth among the others in the odd band of people, she wasn't sure yet if she could completely trust the only other woman and the only one of whom shared some common ground with her in that of a little one on the farm, as she she had chosen a seat beside the human.
Leaving the farm for the newest errand had been difficult, developing a bond with her little Lyn that she hadn't wanted to leave. She had held her little one tightly, telling her to do well and be strong and to play as often as she could after getting her work done; she didn't want to leave her, but at least she was in good hands and in a life that would allow her to be the best she could be.
Entering the bar had been different for lack of better words, how often was it seen of a twi'lek of her coloring walking into a bar free? She didn't show it, after her life, she'd never show something as simple as that to bother her. No, she simply ignored them and continued with the group, granted she did stick closer to them than she would have liked. Bad experiences with her old 'family' coming to mind more often then she would have liked, though this one was leaving a better impression after the time spent working, eating, and sleeping near them; she'd even admitted to herself the human male was fairly attractive, for a human.
Now at the table she simply leans her head against her hand and watches the people, looking for any that would approach them as their contact.
*Perception +8, I'm at work right now and unable to update my sheet or see if that changed any, so um forgive me ^^;*

Dexter sets with the rest of his new friends. Waiting to hear from the someone, he passes the time watching the sabac game and checking stuff out onhis data pad. His life has brought him to alot of different places. This would have to be one of the moe colorful places he has been and so far the friendlius. He looks though some the holonet now as he waits seeing what is going on at home and though out the galaxy. Most of it is the same old stuff paryzine the glory of the empire and that there are enemys everywhere. He had heard allthis before. His training had made him look for enemys everywhere he went and he had made a few here and there. Looking up at the Tar'ja seeing that she was on edge about something. "I am sure she will be fine with Dosennaa at the farm. There shouldn't be to much to worry about. If you want I can see about setting up away to keepin touch with them if you like?" He understands her conserns. He has come to think of he little farm house as a home over the last few days. helping out with repairs on stuff and the taking care of the childern was something Dexter had come to enjoy.

**Outside Mos Eisley: Dosennaâ€™s farm house**
The next few days pass quickly. Chase spent his time around the farm staying busy either with the odd job or playing a game or two with the children when time allowed. The squeals and laughter as they chased each other playing tag or hide and seek made him smile. As did the pleas of continued playing when he said he had to stop for the moment to take care of some adult things. The time with the children hardened his resolve to take the fight to the Empire so that these children and other across the galaxy had a chance to grow up without fear and terror.
He had made an effort to get to know the others. Like him they did not divulge much about themselves. But for some reason Chase had the feeling that they all ended up her for some reason. The Force had lead him to Kasga. Maybe it had lead all of them here to Dosennaaâ€™s farm. If that was the case something was in store for them.
The relaxed atmosphere has put Chase into a good mood despite the heartbreaking news he had to deliver to Dosennaa. Like her husband she was resilient and strong. It took a couple of days for her to come around to talking to him but the after the funeral she approached him for an opportunity to talk.
They sat on the farm roof, legs hanging into the courtyard as the children played below them. Sitting quietly for a moment. He wasnâ€™t sure what to say. When Dosennaa asked him a question he found that the words came pretty easily.
â€œSo Chase tell me of your time with my husband. How long did you know him.â€ She asked as she looked up at him. Even sitting there was a noticeable size difference.
Chase smiled at the good memories. **â€œOnly about seven months. Hard to believe I know. I was looking for a way off the planet. A quick way with out any Imperial entanglements if you get my meaning. The *Bloodhawk* was looking for hired hands and I was able to secure a spot on the crew.â€** He looked out across the desert. Sand as far as one could see. He looked as he was seeing what he was remembering
**â€Turns out I was basically a cabin boy at the Mercy of the first mate, Zet.â€**
At the mention of Zet Dosennaa nods, â€œAh yes I remember Rasen mentioning him.â€
**â€Probably nothing good to say about him either?â€**  He smiled as he continued. **Well being the new crewmate I didnâ€™t know anyone, Rasen ended up talking to me first thing. We ended up sharing quarters on the ship. He was quiet most of the time with the others but we had a good friendship. Itâ€™s one that I will always remember. Most of the time was spent loading and unloading cargo and traveling from place to place. Till we ended up on the forsaken planet.â€**  His hands balled up into fists for a moment till he quickly let a breath go and tried to relax. A Jedi relaxing technique that could be quickly used to calm themselves almost always worked and it did this time.
**â€As I mentioned the other night. We found out the cargo was people. Frozen in carbonite as I later found out. Rasen discovered it when one of the crates broke open by accident. I had never seen him so enraged before. There must have been three-dozen of the crates. Rasen yelled at the Captain and then ran into the ships hold.â€** Chase brought his right leg up and bent it as he shifted his position to face Dosennaa better. She was quiet and he thought he could see tears in her eyes. He thought about stopping but a nod from her told him to continue.
**â€I began asking the captain about what was going on. He looked ashamed for what he did. He said that he had no choice. Weather that was true or not Iâ€™m not sure. He had always been fair to me and the others I really have no reason to not believe him. In that time Rasen exited the ship with a blaster. He shot and killed one of the Trandos. It was then all hell broke loose. They fired on Rasen and he fell to the ground. The Captain and the rest of us fought back against them and Zet. He had plans on taking the ship for himself. I knocked Zet out and left him there as the captain gave his life so that the rest of us, and the ship could get away.â€** He paused for a moment.
**â€His last words were of you. He told me to find you. And to bring you that box. It took me more three weeks to finally do so. Oh one more thing.â€** He reached into thecaargo pocket on his left pant leg and pulled out the box that Jensen gave him on Druckenwell. It held 1250 credits. Chase had taken his share out already.
**â€This is also for you. We sold the ship on Druckenwell and split it between the crew and those we rescued from the slavers. Itâ€™s Rasenâ€™s share plus a little extra thrown in by the crew. It isnâ€™t much but I hope it helps a little.â€** The smile on Dosennaaâ€™s furry face made him feel good. She gave him a quick hug as she took the box.
â€œThank you so much Chase. Thank you for telling me your story and about your time with Rasen. The fact that he befriended you so easily speaks volumes about you and the kind of person you are. Even though we have met under these unfortunate circumstances I am glad to have met you.â€
Their conversation continued for another thirty minutes, each of them trading stories about Rasen. Some good laughs followed that were shared by both. It was as if sharing what they each knew of Rasen lifted their spirits and his loss was did not hurt as much now. For that Chase was happy.
----------------------------------------------------------
Dosennaa had asked the five of them to head to the Melt Down CafÃ©. It was the same place she had sent them a couple of times before. But this time it seemed different. She was worried about something. Chase assured her that all would be ok.
The melt Down CafÃ© was like a lot of other Cantinas Chase had been in over the last few years. Even the patrons seemed similar to others he had been in. They all seemed to have their regulars, loners, wanabees, and gamblers. When Chase saw the Trandos, dregs of the galaxy came to mind. He kept an eye on the pair. They took the side booth that had always been offered to them for free. But that was all that was free as the drinks were not.
Chase sat next to the Twiâ€™lek. In a cantina such as this one like her working the floor was not an uncommon sight. As beautiful as she was Chase had gotten the feeling that there was a lot more to Tarâ€™ja than met the eye. She was loving and caring that much he knew. For it was easy to see in her dealing with the little one she had left back on the farm. She cared a lot about the little one. She had a hard side yet a soft one that seemed to want to come out.
He looked at the other woman with them, a human by the name of Diedra. There was rigidity about her. That was obvious. Chase had seen her relax a bit when she was with the little girl that was with her. But as soon as she noticed someone seeing her show some affection the rigidity was back quickly. With dark hair and intense blue eyes, that reminded him of his other weapon that he carried, she tried hard to hide her looks.
Looking at Kasga the one he met in Bestine. The one Master Garet had led him to. Chase trusted him more so than any of the others at the moment. Maybe it was because of how they met. Either way it was good that he was with them. He had been dependable when they were trying to get where they were going Chase saw no reason why he would not continue to be dependable.
His gaze finally fell on Dexter the little Bothan. Chase had never met a Bothan before. He seemed to be friendly enough, quick to talk and share a quick story. He seemed that if pushed into a fight he would be tenacious.
The five of them sat around the booth, not friends not strangers either, but an awkward balance of the two.
He looked at Traâ€™ja. **â€We should probably order something while we wait so we donâ€™t look too out of place here. I wonder who it is were meeting?â€**  He said quietly enough so that only those at the table could hear.
He waved for the local girl to come over. Disinterested she finally sauntered over. And looked at they all and waited.
**â€Iâ€™ll have a Corellian ale.â€**  He pushed a few credits onto the table to cover the coat of the ale.
He looked over the cantina and focused on the Force. It was beginning to come easier to him lately. He could see how the Force interlaced with the patrons and those at his table. It was a beautiful thing to see. He could see the beauty of those around him. It still fascinated him that he could do this.

Kasga has a lot of trouble fitting in with the farm and orphange. He attends the funeral, looking worn and worried. He helps out with the chores fairly reasonably, but prefers those that keep him indoors during the day. He a good help with broken down equipment and the like. But when ever he goes outside, it's only for a brief period. He's tense and uneasy the entire time.
In stark contrast, he seems to prefer being outside at night. He spends a little time tinkering with the speeder bike he and Chase rode in on, using small spotlights to see as he works. During these times, he relaxes a bit and can be seen watching the sky and horizon. He clearly ready to be up and away.
He's cordial to everyone, but does not relax completely around anyone even Chase. There seems to be too much unsaid that's Kasga has not yet let go of. When Dosennaa talks to him about his brother and his antics, he joins in the conversation fondly passing along an anecdote or two.
Kasga turns the conversation quickly serious, wanting to know about Kirn's commanding officer and his last mission. He's not sure how much Dosennaa knows or how much danger she could be in if he confides in her. Since the safehouse coordinates are here, she's his only link to what his brother was involved in before their last mission.
----------------------------------------------------------
When Dosennaa asks them all to meet a contact in the Melt Down cafe, Kasga jumps at the chance. His duffle is packed and ready well ahead of the meeting time. Once they all get to the cafe, Kasga slides his duffle under the table and takes a seat next to Dexter. Kasga seems far less nervy than he has the past few days, now that there's something he can do. Hopefully, the contact can help him connect to the Rebellion his brother spoke to him about. If Kirn got out, he'd go back to them.

Tar'ja glances back to the human male and nods her head, she didn't really care what she had to drink just so long as it was strong. She straightens up and looks to the waitress "something with the name whiskey it, I don't care what." she passes a few credits to cover whatever was brought to her and leans back in her seat looking over the others.
They truly were an odd bunch, no one was truly relaxed..a glance at the human male beside her had her amending that thought to maybe HE was relaxed but the rest didn't seem to be. Strange-friends..maybe that's what she should start to call them, she supposed one day they'd all have to get it out in the open their stories; a glance to the woman had her lekku twitching, she wasn't sure she wanted to her that ones story. Till then though...strange-friends would have to suffice.
"What do you suppose this job will require of us?" she whispers to the human beside her, turning pale blue eyes to him.

### **Yogi** (2009-03-11 14:50:39)

Chase pushed his credits forward to the waitress and nodded. He wasn't sure how long they were gong to have to wait. As he looked around the bar things seemed normal. Nothing seemed amiss.
Tar'ja leaned slightly closer as she whispered to him. "What do you suppose this job will require of us?"
He sat there for a second not turning towards her as he thought. He wasn't sure. When he turned to look at her he saw her eyes up close for the first time. He had never see their like before. He started to speak, stopped, then continued quickly. The others most likely didn't notice but he was sure Tar'ja did. ***Well if she didn't catch that I'd be lucky. Keep your mind on the task at hand Chase.*** he thought to himself.
He kept his voice low as he shrugged and answered her question. **"I don't know. Could be anything I suppose. Whatever it is, it's something to do. And if it's something against the Empire all the better."** The last part was said matter-of-fact tone.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-03-11 15:06:09)

Tar'ja tilted her head slightly at his pause before speaking, did she have something on her face or did he not know what to say? **"I don't know. Could be anything I suppose. Whatever it is, it's something to do. And if it's something against the Empire all the better."** hm...must have not known what to say. She nods her head in agreement, taking down the empire meant making things a better place for everyone, and would avenge Lyn's real mother; something she wanted to make sure was done.
She watches the human for a few minutes before sighing, curiosity giving in "we've worked together for a few days and I do not know your name. I hope you will forgive me for being rude."

---

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-11 17:13:28)

Chase watched her nod in agreement. That was a good thing. It seamed that all of them had some sort of dislike for the Empire. They went back to waiting for who ever was to show up. Not all of the impulsivness had been trained out of him my Master Garet and he was starting to fidget. He began a relaxition technique that always worked well and seconds later he was focused and calm again. ***Stay focused Chase. Loose your focus and loose the edge you might have.*** He thought.
He heard Tar'ja sigh next to him. He looked at her again, this time he didn't falter when he looked into her eyes, he was prepared for it. "We've worked together for a few days and I do not know your name. I hope you will forgive me for being rude." She said.
He smiled at her. **"Rude no, cautious yes."**  He said and continued. **"My name is Chase Davion"** he leaned back into the booth. **"I do know your name. I heard it from the little one that was with you during one of the times I was playing with the children. Nice to finally meet you Tar'ja."** He finished with a half smile and a nod.
He looked at the others. **"I wonder how long we're going to have to wait?"**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-03-11 20:11:43)

A hint of a smile brushes across her lips at the mention of knowing her name from her little Lyn. "She is a wonder, my little one..." she sighs softly and looks back to him, the smile gone for the time, replaced with her more watchful self "It is good to meet you Chase Davion." another hint of a smile with a slight twitch of her lekku.
Her head turns to look around the Cantina, the hint of smile falling again as she studies the room "We can hope not long to be kept waiting." she leans back into the booth and crosses her arms over her chest. A glance over to him showed his breathing changing, what was he doing? "you keep breathing oddly.."

---

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-11 23:38:30)

At the mention of the young Twi'lek girl Lyn, a smile quickly adorns Tar'ja's face. The smile looks much better that the stoic expression that is commonly there. It seemed like it was hard to express happiness for her. Chase wondered why. What could have caused her to become withdrawn? ***I'm sure that we all have our shaded past. Things we did that we're not happy about.*** He thought. With the current state of the galaxy a hard life was more common than not. Still the past was the past. He had a new beginning here or do it seamed. As did the others. Chase still had a goal though, make contact with the Rebellion.
When she looked back at him the smile was gone. It was replaced with the one that was normally there. "It is good to meet you Chase Davion." Another hint of a smile broke through, He wasn't sure be he thought he also saw her lekku twitch. Having only dealt with one Twi'lek before, one that was always angry at something, his knowledge was limited at best.
Regardless her smile was met with one of his own as they both went to looking across the cantina. She mentioned about not being kept waiting. He nodded in agreement. How long were they being expected to wait. He felt his impatience rise again and chided himself for it as he began the technique again.
"You keep breathing oddly.." Tar'ja says to him. He looked at her. ***Stang, I need to work on that so its not as noticeable.*** He shrugged slightly. **"Impatient a bit I guess, I shouldn't be. The controlled breathing is a way to calm myself, find my focus.** It sounded hokey. He knew how it sounded as he thought the same when Garet first taught it to him. It took him a while to get the hang of it but one he did he could almost instantly calm himself from just about anything that was happening. It had saved his life on at least one occasion.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-03-11 23:55:45)

Tar'ja continues to watch the breathing, relaxation? focus? she gives him a look that clearly stated just how hokey that sounded "..right..." she chuckles softly, this was...nice...relaxing, laughing..smiling; she wasn't so sure why she was doing it more but it wasn't bad at least...no it felt...nice.
She leans back a tad more and sighs softly, even going so far as to subtly and unconsciously scoot closer to the human in a form of trying to gain comfort she hadn't really had in a long...long time.
"You're pretty nice...for a human..." she looks to him with a slight smirk "no offense..haven't dealt with too many good humans." her fingers idly finger the broken chain choker around her neck.

---

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-12 00:39:38)

Chase see the look on Tar'ja's face and he knew instantly what she was thinking. She thought he was a bit crazy. She confirmed it when she chuckled out a . "..right..." Chase just shrugged again and smiled as he leaned forward and looked at the entrance. No one had entered since they took the booth. ***I wonder when?*** 
Chase leaned back again and looked at Tar'ja. He wasn't sure as he didn't notice her move but he would have sworn that she was a tad bit closer than a moment ago. That thought escaped his mind when she spoke, a slight smirk across her face. "You're pretty nice...for a human..." This time his head tilted a bit to the side with an eyebrow raised. Noticing his reaction she continued. "...no offense..haven't dealt with too many good humans." He saw her fingers absently play with the chain choker that was around her neck.
It was then a realization hit him. A young Twi'lek woman, one that was very attractive. It was not uncommon to hear of such things. He had heard his share aboard the *Bloodhawk* when they had delivered cargo and had a day or two in port. A couple of the crew had a thing for Twi'lek slave girls. The stories they came back with could unsettle even the hardest of people.
**"No offense taken Tar'ja. I can't pretend to understand things that haven't happened to me. There are good humans out there. But with the propaganda the Empire puts out it seems like they are in short supply now. In my travels I've seen most go along with it because they don't want to be singled out for thinking differently than the Imps. That doesn't make it right by any means. They are just a bunch of nerfs in a herd. A few bad encounters can jade a persons view of something easily and it's not always easy to turn things back around, unfortunately."** He was looking her in the eyes. They were an inviting shade of blue.
He broke the look and looked to see where the waitress was that was supposed to be getting their drinks.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-03-12 00:58:05)

Did he really understand? looking into those blue eyes so inviting and calm...he understood..she hadn't said much of anything. He only noticed her choker..the one thing she really kept from her time with 'family' and he understood. A smile returns to her lips, her features softening as her lekku twitch a few times.
Even when he looked away she still watched him, someone that understood and seemed to even care, and a human at that...maybe they weren't so bad after all, *at least…this one isn't so bad…* Turning her head to look for the waitress the smile doesn't leave her this time "maybe someday I'll tell you a story." she says softly, letting her head tilt to look at him.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-03-12 09:45:03)

As the Tar'ja and Chase get to know each other, Kasga finds himself wondering as well about their contact. *We're here, I wonder when the contact would be comfortable enough to approach them.* Following his mental trail, Kasga speaks quietly, **"The sort of person we're meeting is usually cautious and nervy. They might not even try today. We just have to wait. Relax, get some food. There may not be time for it after."**
Kasga pulls his comlink into his lap. He turns the volume low and dials in the local Imperial frequency. If they're operating in town, he should be able to hear it, though it'll probably be encrypted. He slips it back into a pocket so he can hear it just a little bit.

Dexter continues to check things over on his data pad. "If anyone wants to float me untill I get some creds it would be great. I kind blew though my funds trying to get away from the my latest scam." He looks up at the others. "Long story. I'll tell you sometime. Anyway as far as I can tell from the holonet there doesn't seem to be anythign happening out of the ordinary. Just the useall popaganda about the Empire and how it is bring law and order to the galaxy. Of coruse if I was to get access to a better computer I could find out more." They might think Dexter is being conseeded about his abilitys but he has been doing this for alittle while now and has had some success with it. "A bantha burger would be nice and a galatic cola Thank you."

Naryens time on the farm was spent working herself to exhaustion at both the physical and mental tasks she could find. When she wasn't reviewing the propaganda on the Imperial controlled holonet and the limited library she was working herself beyond reasonable limits whenever she was given a task. During the day she stayed where she could observe or help with the children, trying hard not to reminisce though mostly failing. At night she would sit outside reading, letting the cool air help relax her mind until she was barely able to walk to her cot. The nightmares kept her from sleeping through the night unless she was exhausted.
She was dressed in used farmhand gear, gloves on her belt and sand/sun goggles around her neck, in various combinations of browns and beiges. Rugged and functional doesn't sound comfortable to some but to Naryen it was a welcome change to her stiff uniform, that was a second skin to her for a long time, or the uncomfortable mechanics overalls. She manages to find a standard holster but not a replacement for her sidearm, unfortunately.
On the night before they left for town Naryen caught herself nodding off outside, a scratching sound startled her awake. A winged reptile/insectoid was molting near her. It ate its discarded skin while its wings settled then it disappeared into the night with a hiss. Naryen smiled after it.
That morning Naryen bids farewell and, given Dossannas vague instructions, tells Lahela that she doesnâ€™t know how long she will be gone but that she will try to visit when and if she can. Lahela hugs her, hard, for a long time before theyâ€™re able to leave but eventually says farewell with a rather disturbing amount of understanding for someone so young. Naryen wonders after that for most of the trip into town. Perhaps this will give her the opportunity she needsâ€¦
**The Melt Down cafÃ©**
Dossannas parting words tumble around in her mind, distracting her, long after theyâ€™ve left. The cantina and its occupants are familiar and as theyâ€™ve been, except for that new protocol droid. Naryen off-handedly wonders how that could have been afforded. Naryen further contemplates all that sheâ€™s learned, the various Imperial propaganda and rhetoric she reviewed before coming here has expanded upon her new point of view. Having been quite overloaded by the experience, over the past few days, she keeps mainly to herself with a thoughtful expression.
Naryen was listening idly to the conversations when Tar'jas laughter startled her. She stares for a moment before noticing the Twiâ€™lek fondling her collar while looking at Chase. ***Ah, I see.*** There was some vague mention about Twiâ€™lek culture and their selling of themselves to various extents. As the shift in tone and body language finds context Naryen decides to take a sudden notice in the patrons so as to show Tarâ€™ja and Chase a little discretion.

Sitting at the table your group awaits the unknown. Dexter shudders as he recalls the imperial propaganda video that was repeated on the holo-net. It showed the treachery of the rebellion and how they single handedly assaulted an imperial world. The video went on to blame the wavering resolve of lesser ranking imperial officers and stressed the importance of imperial doctrine. The video ended with a view of the streets on Varlbrindal its peoples slaughtered no survivors.
Kasga attempts to tune into an imperial frequency. His efforts are meet only by static. Judging by the patrols of the way in and the check point it is obvious that after recent events they are scrambling their frequency. As you wait and converse none of you preserve any danger from the local patrons, some of them can be dangerous given the right circumstances but no one here today has been know to cause trouble.
Chase waves the waitress over and Tar`ja begins her order only to have the waitress ignore her completely. The waitress continues to flirt with the Sullustan captain and his pile of credits. The protocol droid does however step up as it had been doing so all day and approaches your booth. â€œGreetings I am SBC-54 at your service.â€ The droid polity takes your order and returns promptly with your order in tray. The droid leaves the drinks and continues its duties.
The serving droid SBC-54 returns after only a few minutes entering your booth. â€œWill there be anything else today?â€ The droid nods as you all politely decline noting your previous order barley touched. â€œI will be near by if needed again.â€ The droid bows slightly and places his tray on the table. â€œYour change masters and thank you.â€ The protocol droid exits the booth and walking towards the side door of the establishment. SBC-54 exits the cantina through the side door leaving his tray behind.
On the tray rests a blinking data pad. Curiously you all exchange glances as the data pad blinks over and over again. Around the cantina no one seams to notice the exchange and they continue their daily routine. The data pad itself a common model for the storage of data, not exactly what one would call change.

Tar'ja had idly sipped at her drink, wincing at the strong taste but it was a welcome one. She sets it down as the droid returns, declining with a shake of her head and begins to settle back against her new...friend? could she call him that? When the data pad catches her eye.
Looking to the others, she reaches for it to see what it would say. It seemed to her that the contact was either the droid, or had been told to deliver it.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-03-12 22:08:17)

When the droid delivers the datapad, Kasga looks at it in dismay. Of course it made sense to do it this way because it limits exposure.
As Tar'ja reaches for the datapad, Kasga murmers tensely,**"Has anyone considered that might be a bomb?"**

### **Yogi** (2009-03-12 22:54:29)

When he looked away Chase was pleased to see that she was smiling and that her features softened. He wondered if her life had been that rough before now. Being a non-Human in a galaxy ruled by the Empire, especially that they had no love for alien species, was a difficult thing to deal with. He had seen it plenty of times in the past. He almost felt sorry but he caught himself. ***No donâ€™t feel sorry for her. Somehow I have a feeling that she would not tolerate anyone feeling sorry for her. Though she is quiet, she seems proud of who she is. Sheâ€™s stronger than she looks.***
Even though he wasnâ€™t looking at her he could picture her eyes and their particular shade of blue. When he was thinking that he heard her soft voice. "Maybe someday I'll tell you a story." She said it so softly that he was pretty sure no one else heard. The right corner of his mouth turned up as he looked at her. He was surprised to see that she was already looking at him.
**â€Iâ€™d like thatâ€** He found himself saying before he even thought it through. He took a breath. **â€And my story, I will share with you.â€**
The five of them sat a bit longer. After being ignored by the waitress the droid finally came over and took the order and returned quickly. Taking his Corellian Ale he took a good taste. It was good, not as good as if he was back on Corellia but it would do. A slight moan of appreciation escaped him as he swallowed the ale. **â€Ahh now that is pretty good.â€** He said to those at the booth.
Tarâ€™ja also took a sip of her drink as the droid came back. â€œWill there be anything else today?â€ When they all declined further service the droid continued and bowed. â€œI will be near by if needed again.â€ It set the tray it was carrying on the table. â€œYour change masters and thank you.â€
Chase watched the droid leave the booth and walk towards the side exit of the cantina. It was then he noticed that Tarâ€™ja was leaning against him slightly. Her shoulder was gently touching his upper arm. Though he wasn't expecting it was a feeling he enjoyed. His perception was torn between the droid who left through the side door and Tarâ€™ja. ***I wonder why the droid left?*** He thought as the side door closed tight.
He noticed that the others were looking at the table. Shifting his eyes he saw the data pad sitting there on the tray its blinking light beckoning them. As Tarâ€™ja reached for it Kasga voiced a thought. "Has anyone considered that might be a bomb?"
Chase looked at the others. **â€Well considering that the droid just left through the side exit it could be a possibility. But given the fact that Dosennaa sent us hereâ€¦â€** He let the sentence drift off. **â€She has no reason to betray any of us. Go ahead Tarâ€™ja, what does it say.â€**

---

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-03-13 11:25:34)

Kasga raises his hand quickly,**"Wait!"**
Continuing more slowly, he lowers his voice**"It's nice that you're so optimistic, Chase. I agree, there is little reason for Dosennaa to betray us, but someone connected to her has already betrayed me and some of my friends. I don't know yet how far that betrayal extends. I'm just saying we should check some before we proceed."**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-03-13 11:48:35)

Tar'ja's hand stops just short of actually touching it, rather simply hovering there as the others stated their cases on whether to trust the stranger or not...rather whether to trust it not to be a bomb or not. She sighs as she looks from one person to the next finally landing on Chase "well...I suppose for their peace of mind maybe it would be best to atleast check it. We've waited this long already, what's a few more minutes." Her lekku twitch low, she was irritated, wanted to know what the job was so they could get to it; though by staying she would get to sit beside the human..no..Chase a bit longer. Her hand retreats, leaning back into her previous position with her shoulder touching his arm. She motions to the pad "check to your hearts content."
*Never said I had picked up the pad in my post for the record.*

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-03-13 12:27:48)

To Tar'ja's casual comment, Kasga grumbles,**"Content? Hah!"**
Kasga reaches over and picks up the serving tray very gently. He then moves it carefully over in front of himself.
Leaning down over the trap, Kasga looks carefully at the edges of the datapad for signs of tampering. Once satisfied that it is not obviously tampered with, he will slowly lift up a edge of the datapad and perform the same inspection underneath. Eventually, he will turn it over and examine the underside thoroughly.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-13 12:45:04)

Chase looked to Kasga as he exclaimed for them to wait. Tar'ja's hand hovered next to the datapad. He continued with his voice lowered.
"It's nice that you're so optimistic, Chase. I agree, there is little reason for Dosennaa to betray us, but someone connected to her has already betrayed me and some of my friends. I don't know yet how far that betrayal extends. I'm just saying we should check some before we proceed."
Chase raised an eyebrow. Several thoughts went through his head. He remembered that Kasga mentioned helping out a friend to do something against the Empire. Did that thing not go as planned? Were they betrayed? Was it someone Dosennaa knew? Troublesome this was.
Tar'ja looked around the table finally landing on him. "Well...I suppose for their peace of mind maybe it would be best to at least check it. We've waited this long already, what's a few more minutes." He hadn't known her long but he thought he saw a sign of frustration. ***But I could be wrong.*** He thought as she resumed her position with her shoulder softly touching his arm and giving the go ahead to check to Kasga's "hearts content"
Which was just what he did. Chase watched him meticulously examining the tray and datapad thoroughly. He was impressed. **"I get the feeling Kasga that tinkering with swoops isn't your only skill."** He said with a smile. They were learning about each other as they watched each other operate. If they were to work well together they were going to need that knowledge.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-03-13 13:25:42)

Holding his face near the datapad, so his scent glands could pick up any chemical taint, Kasga responded warmly, **"If it flys, floats or hyperspace jumps, I've probably piloted it, fixed it or shot at it. You can learn a lot of things fast when the alternative is breathing hard vaccuum."**
Pausing for a moment to gather his audience, Kasga continues, **"When I was doing convoy guard work out Bestine way, the Devorian pirates used to like sabotaging outgoing ships by bombing their hyperdrives midway down the Corellian Trade Spine. We used to have to crawl the engineering section of the haulers trying to see or smell their devices. We found a couple of them that way. Just another day in the Corps."**

<strong>The Melt Down cafÃ©</strong>
Naryen watched the droid drop off the pad then leave out the side door and continued to observe the patrons. Usually terrorists used droids as delivery methods for various means of death and destruction. She looked down at the pad and wondered if this was how she would meet her end.
Watching Tar'ja's reaction to Kasga warning she couldnâ€™t help but casually smile and in a conversational tone **â€œIt could be an explosive or a vaporized nerve agent, an airborne retro-virus or aerosoled dermal solvent coupled with a delay triggered accelerant. Either way weâ€™re already dead, may as well see what it says.â€** she gestures to the pad. **â€œIâ€™d go after that droid but if itâ€™s an explosive it could be set remotely if we look to not be cooperating.â€** She swallows down a worm of terror. ***Survival may come from a clear head here.***
She turned to Kasga with her elbows on the table and her chin in her hands. **â€If there is any relevant experiences we need to know Iâ€™d be interested in hearing them, but this could also be simply a data pad with a wireless listening bug installed. May be best to discuss them later should we get out of here aliveâ€¦ but I *will* want to discuss them.â€** the last part was intended to be subtle but Naryen winced slightly that it came out too harsh but looked back at Kasga hopeful that he understood. ***Later!***

"Bless the maker, Let me see that." Dexter reaches over and grabs the data pad as if there was nothing to fear from it at all. "Frist year of training for Spynet they did this very thing and if they wanted us dead they could have done that by now. Besides there wouldn't be enuff explosives in here to kill but maybe one of us at best." Dexter activates the Data pad to see what is on it.
((OCC: computer use +13 to activate the data pad.))

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **master_Tru** (2009-03-14 10:29:15)

Kasga checks over the data pad as it continues to blink. Finding no signs of tampering he flips it over and continues the investigation. Beyond the booth the cantina progresses as normal the patrons drink the band plays none seam to notice your current situation.
Dexter grabs the data pad examining it for himself. Flipping it over the Bothan is satisfied that the device has not been tampered with and activates it. The blinking stops and the screen begins to play a prerecorded message. A single male voice begins to talk in a low tone that can easily be heard throughout the booth. On the screen a single Neimoidian dress in a tan brown uniform with no rank insignia relays a message. The Neimoidian looks aged, a single scar across his wrinkled face breaks his otherwise hairless features. Beside him a familiar looking droid stands obediently SBC-54, and behind them an unmarked durasteel wall.
â€œGreetings and well meet travelers.â€ The Neimoidian cracks a smile, which gives him a friendly appearance. â€œI represent an organization with several galactic interests both large and small. Recently it has come to my attention that we all share a similar interest. A mutual friend who we will keep anonymous under the circumstances owns a small farm not too far from your current location.â€ It is obvious he is referring to Dosennnaa`s farm you all exchange knowing glances towards each other. â€œIt was our friend who brought your group to my interest. I was told that you where individuals who could be trusted and who could get a job done. Together we can make a difference.â€
SBC-54 bows to the Neimoidain and walks out of view of the message. â€œI am sending my personal droid with this message. He will act as our mutual point of contact. He awaits you in the side alley as you listen to this message. We also have a military channel in which the empire has not cracked â€¦.. yet. We will be using this to co-ordinate our efforts should you choose to be a part of something much larger then yourselves. For those who need more encouragement I can offer a commission.â€ The Neimoidain is passed a cylinder which he holds up. â€œKasga has the frequency for the military channel it should only be used in emergencies. Please I implore you to make a difference go into the alley and speck to SBC-54 he will relay the mission briefing. Good luck and may the force be with you.â€ The message ends leaving the pad with a blank dark screen.

"Well now that is interesting. I guess we have made a good showing of ourselves. Now if this is on the up and up we have a chance at some solid creds and to make a difference or there is several heavly armed troopers awaiting for us. I for one am going to do as requested cause it is not a trap if you know about it." Dexter Smiles and makes his way out of the both. "You guys comming or not this could be fun." Dexter is not one to go into this lightly but he douted that Dosennnaa would want them dead. Unless of course she was better of an actor then he thought then they where more then likely on there way to there deaths or a trip to Kessel, either way they where dead.

Tar'ja looks to the others as the message plays, when it was finished she smirks and looks over to Chase first, then the others, though the smirk drops once her head turns from the human male at her side "Well, I'm certainly in. Anyone else? we don't want to keep them waiting."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-14 17:34:16)

Chase smiles as Dexter grabs the data pad and activates i. He also caught the mention of the Spynet training. Maybe the rumors of Bothan spies were true after all. It was a piece of information that he tucked away for future reference. ***Perhaps he might be able to find out some information on other Jedi on the run form the Empire. Later when I have no choice to reveal just who I am.*** He thought.
The message began to play a single non-descript figure, a Neimoidian from the looks of it was on the screen. Next to the alien stood the droid that had just dropped of the data pad. The Neimoidian began speaking about Dosennaa and them all sharing a similar interest. Chase looked at the others his gaze stopping last on Tar'ja for an quick instant before looking back at the image.
â€œIt was our friend who brought your group to my interest. I was told that you where individuals who could be trusted and who could get a job done. Together we can make a difference.â€ The Neimoidian said. For some reason Chase had reason to believe he was listening to a soldier in the Rebellion. It was just a gut feeling he had.
The droid left the screen. â€œI am sending my personal droid with this message. He will act as our mutual point of contact. He awaits you in the side alley as you listen to this message. We also have a military channel in which the empire has not cracked â€¦.. yet. We will be using this to co-ordinate our efforts should you choose to be a part of something much larger then yourselves. For those who need more encouragement I can offer a commission.â€
At the mention of a military channel Chase raised an eyebrow and a smile came to his face. ***Finally maybe I…no we all can do something to affect the Empire.*** His thought was interrupted when it was mentioned that Kasga already has the military channel. He looked at the Duro a faint look of surprise on his face. ***Stirred up trouble with the Imps huh. I bet you did."*** He thought.
"Please I implore you to make a difference go into the alley and speak to SBC-54 he will relay the mission briefing. Good luck and may the force be with you.â€ The message ended and screen went blank. The cantina seemed quieter now than before.
Chase sat back and let out an exhale surprised that he had been holding his breath. He met the gaze of the others trying to read what they were thinking. He felt the touch to Tar'ja's shoulder against his arm. It was odd but it felt reassuring that she was there next to him. This was what he wanted for awhile now. He was sure that this was his way into the Rebellion. All he had to do was step out the side door into the alley way.
He Took a drink of the Corellian ale in front of him and set it down as Dexter spoke. What the Bothan said made him smile. ***Just because you know what's happening doesn't mean it's not a trap.*** He thought but also agreed and doubted that Dosennaa wanted them dead. He had known Rasen pretty well even though it was only for a short time. He had never heard the little Bimm say anythig good about the Empire. Quite the opposite as a matter of fact.
When Tar'ja said she was going also he nodded looked at her. The right side of his mouth turning up into a lopsided grin. Deep down, even thought he didn't realize it, he was glad she accepted the request put forth to them. Hopefully they would all accept.
He looked at Dexter and Tar'ja. **"I'm going also. I've been wanting this for some time now. It's something I should have done long before this."** Chase said with a serious tone. It was the most serious he had been in front of them since the night they all met.

Naryen notes the species and his apparent age, complete with scar, after noting a tan uniform without insignia. ***Interesting, and with a disarmingly friendly behavior, looks like a recruiter already.*** she continues to listen to the sales pitch. "Together we can make a difference.â€, "...part of something much larger then yourselves." She's heard this talk before and it now sounds hollow and bitter. Her smile immediately looks forced as her stomach twists slightly. ***Again with the promises.***
â€œKasga has the frequency for the military channel it should only be used in emergencies.â€ At this she looks at Kasga, clearly considering him. ***Indeed! We will need to talk later.***
â€œâ€¦and may the force be with you.â€ At this her smile vanishes and she turns back to the pan, staring intently. There were intelligence reports she was provided with (discreetly) that some of the terrorists were directed by religious fanatics that elicited zealotry in their followers by invoking a mystical power referred to as The Force. Painful memories echoed in her mind and sheâ€™s wearing it plainly on her face. ***Iâ€™ve been lied to so much. Are these people going to be any different?***
She listens to the others talking plainly and openly about walking into the ally and watches Dexter declare to the room openly his intentions. ***Are they planning on holding hands when they walk out? Dexter seems close to breaking into song! "Lead them to slaughter with promises of glory and they will go willingly."***
Sitting tense, with her hands folded tightly in front of her, staring at the pad, she is the poster child for hesitation and green around the gills.

He sat there for a minute watching the two who hadn't said anything yet. Deidra and Kasga. Chase was pretty sure that Kasga was going to be in on this but when he looked Deidra in the eyes he sensed a feeling of uncertainty. Something was bothering her immensely it was as plain as the twin suns int eh sky that were outside the small cantina.
He reached out to touch the Force. It came easier as each day passed the exercises were working as Master Garet said they would. he looked at Deidra through the Force. It was confusing to him what he was seeing. He felt several different emotions emanating from her. Disbelief, distrust, uncertainty, he wasn't quite sure. But something was holding her back from agreeing.
He looked at Deidra ***What is she thinking? Stang, I wish I had more training so I could read her better.***
He figured asking her was the best approach. **"Deidra what are you thinking? Do you not believe the message. Like you said before if they wanted us dead we already would be. We all ended up on that farm at the same time for a reason. Was it a coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. But I'll tell you this. I don't believe it was a coincidence. We're here for a reason. Maybe not all for the same reasons but were here none the less."**

Tar'ja looks with intent to the other woman at the table, listening to Chase's atempt to reasure her. A sigh escapes her lips, her lekku rising and falling slightly with her breath, alright...somethings needed to be said. Reaching over, the twi'lek rests a hand on the womans arm "Are you going to let your past beliefs hold you from doing something better. We were both there." Her tone is even, soft, but imploring her to remember.
"They almost shot Lyn and I at point blank, for orders. That...That kid had hesitated for a just a minute at the thought of killing a little girl and was going to go through with it anyway because of orders. The people, citizans, running and being shot at by the ones that were supposed to protect them for orders." She pauses a minute, letting the words sink, she knew, she remembered that woman in the uniform had no doubt that she had those same orders.
"Do you want them..all the little ones, -your- little one to grow up in a time when at a moments notice, that order can be given again and she'd be dead for no reason. Or do you want to make sure you have done, -everything- possible to make sure she can grow up in a world, in a galaxy better then what we have grown up in." There's more emotion in her voice now, ancients help her she wasn't going to let her Lyn ever go through life like she did "I don't want my girl to grow up thinking the only thing anyone will see her for is as a slave to men of any species. We can stop this, we have a chance to stop it all. Help us to stop it."
Her voice was nearing frantic, memories she'd burried starting to resurfice, she wasn't going to let Lyn have to steal to live, or sell herself just to get by if she could help it, there was something better for all non-humans and this was going to help them gain it.

Dexter's impatience was unknown to Kasga, so he is surprised when Dexter takes over the datapad. Kasga looks resigned as Dexter activates the recorded message. At least Kasga was pretty much done with his inspection.
As the message plays, Kasga listens agast. *A Neimoidian! Why would they send him? It's not like they were hiring mercenaries. No wonder he sent the droid. His cowardace is appalling. Still I need this connection. It is currently my best link to figuring out Kirn's fate.*
Chase's impassioned plea to....Deidra breaks him out of his morbidity. Tar'ja revelation is a surprise, but only in that it has happened to someone he knew. He'd already heard about the Atravis Sector Massacres.
He looked over at Deidra. Kasga speaks quietly, **"Orders are orders. But no soldier should be required to execute criminal orders. What I've seen of the Empire is a group working to control as much as possible. They have few qualms about how they do so, criminal or not. I don't know if we really can make a difference, but I know that it can never get better if we all give up without trying to help. Thinking the Empire is impossible to stop is just more propaganda. Another way of control. From what I've seen you're a very competent person. It would be a shame for you to waste all that in the criminal sector."**

Dexter starts to head for the door and maybe his end of his life. He has never really been one to really worry about his own life just the lives of his friends so if he walked to the alley frist and it was a trap, they might make it away and to safety. He walks out of the cantaina and heads for the alley. "I will head in frist and make contact, if everything is ok then the rest follow. If not we take as many of them with us as we can."

Naryen listens patiently to the reassurances and tries to take them in the spirit of good intentions. For some reason she wants to trust that what is being said by these people is genuine. Perhaps itâ€™s because they are such a disparate group yet all seem to have common motivations. Perhaps itâ€™s just that they arenâ€™t wearing Imperial uniforms. She recalls how she and Lahela interacted on that point and Naryen discards that idea. She becomes acutely conscious of her uniform in her pack, like a weight holding her down, holding her back.
As Tar'ja speaks, opens up to her in fact, Naryens undercurrent of insecurity and doubt resurface with a vengeance. Hearing what seems to be genuine emotion in the voice of someone that was so cold, distant, and even hostile with her before reminds her again how much sheâ€™s been through. She feels the soft but firm reassurance conveyed through the hand on her arm and finds that she canâ€™t look at anything else.
â€œâ€¦make a difference.â€ â€œâ€¦be part of something greater than yourself.â€ The Nemoidians voice echoes in her mind.
Staring at Tar'jas hand, eyes wide and face tense, Naryensâ€™ eyes tear up as ripples of tension war through the muscles on her forearm. A small voice speaks in hope that she doesnâ€™t misinterpret the reaction as wanting Tar'jas to let go. ((OCC: The muscles on her forearm are trembling and though what she is wearing doesnâ€™t show it sheâ€™s likely trembling underneath. Rage. Fear.))
**â€We all need some time to talk more.â€** almost to herself, then she licks her lips and pitches her voice for the small booth. **â€œWhether I believe what heâ€™s saying or he believes, it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™ve heard the words heâ€™s used before.â€** She nods to the pad as she recalls the naval university recruitersâ€™ enthusiasm and energy and his use of almost identical language. â€œMake a difference!â€ â€œBring stability and order to a chaotic and dangerous galaxy!â€ â€œBe part of something greater than yourself!â€ â€œEnsure prosperity and security for all Imperial citizens.â€ such a wonderful image of diversity and harmony that man painted in her mind. For a moment his smiling face is a chimerical mix of the recruiter features, the Nemoidian and the scenes from Varbrindal that then congeals into Admiral Satos face as he issues General Order 21.
Her expression becomes twisted with disgust and hatred as she recalls all that she has been a part of.
A lifetime.
Her lifetime on a dedicated Imperial Planet covered in universities populated by young people devoting every day to furthering their self-improvement and therefore the improvement of the Empire through there contribution.
**â€I *canâ€™t* be used again.â€** Though the words come out somewhere between a hiss and a snarl, the emphasis on the word â€œcanâ€™tâ€ echoes the turmoil in her mind and comes out like something is tearing at her insides. She pulls her forearm, slowly but firmly, away from Tar'jas hand.

Tar'ja holds firm to the arm, eyes narrowing. She couldn't be used?? Used??? "You Chose that life. You *Let* yourself be used." Her grip would tighten on the arm, her lekku shaking in anger and the thoughts of how anyone could stand by after doing what she'd done and not try and make up for it.
"You heard why that...that soldier tried to kill us. You heard the screams of the dying. You held and protected a survior, and I'm *sure* you are guilty of more." she didn't say it, she would respect and not out her right now, but it was implied; that order had been given to all of them, as far as the twi'lek knew, she'd shot at civilians as well.
"You want to walk the rest of your life with the guilt?" *The dead walking beside you* "You want to watch her grow up and die at their hands or worse." *Become what you were* "Are you going to just sit back and do nothing? What would your parents say to that?" *How do you know they aren't dead from a simlier order* "You.can.stop.this. You can do what the others can't." *You can be the voice of those you killed, you can avenge them.*
Tar'ja's voice and words are careful as she watches the woman, making sure the underlying meaning behind them are heard loud and clear for her. "Stop This." She hadn't lost her cool like this since....back then when she first started, but this...she'd done horrible things in her past, hell she killed her own 'family' but at least...at least she wanted to change..and to do something good. "You and I have done...horrible things in the past. We have the chance to make amends for those deeds, to change, to prove we aren't those murderers and crooks that we once were. There's more out there then what the bastards-" Imperials was the word not used "are telling us. I'm tired of being told what to think, that I'm not as good as you because you are simply a different species. We're equal, and that's what needs to be brought back. Equality, Happiness, Life."
Tar'ja's life hadn't been easy, but at least she knew how to read people, and how to use what she knew to her advantage...and to never give up.

As Tar'ja talked to Deidra he was surprised by the conversation thought he did his best to not show it. Even if he didn't he doubted that others would notice as they were all watching the two. His surprise did show when Dexter rose and stated he was going to check outside the side door. Disbelief was more like it when he looked at the Bothan. ***Doesn't he understand that if Deidra doesn't agree to go along the implications this could have for those that have already helped and contacted us?*** He thougt incrediously.
He shook his head at Dexter and gave a hand motion for him to wait. If the Bothan did, he did. If not then he was pretty much on his own for the moment.
Chase focused back on the two women in time to here Deidra state that they needed to talk more, she's heard it all before and that she would not be used again. ***Used by who and to what purpose?*** He thought. He knew thay all had a past. Some were probably a lot more shady than his. His was different to say the least. Never impoverished or alone, always having someone to rely upon. His past was probably very different than the others. And that didn't even take into consideration his ability in the Force. When that is finally revieled to the others it would probably be a big hurdle.
Chase listened as Tar'ja continued with Deidra. The emotion was surprising to watch. In their short conversation before he felt a feeling for her. She was very different than him somethign drew him and it made him want to know her better. It wasn't just her physical appearance as she was beautiful but it was the differences, the experiences she had gone through. Maybe they could learn form each other. Chase knew he trusted to easily, he could sense in Tar'ja that it was very hard for her to put trust into someone other than herself.
He waited for Deidra to respond to Tar'ja.

Kasga is startled by the emotion expressed by the Twilek woman. Kasga speaks in a conciliatory manner, **"Tar'ja, not everyone makes amends for their past the same way. No one else can choose your path. They will each have to choose their own path."**
Turning to Deirdra, Kasga tries to convince her further,**"Deirdra, you will be used again. You cannot prevent that, it is the way of the galaxy. That is true if you are in the Empire, or Corporate Sector or Hutt space. The thing you can prevent is not to be used AGAINST YOUR WILL.
The Rebellion I was introduced to, says it seeks to put more control into the hands of the individual. It is a military organization, so there will be limit on how far that extends. Hopefully, it will extend to not taking military action against civilians or other criminal acts. The Empire has shown itself to be willing to commit such acts. Organized crime also sees fit to act against civilians with impunity. If you chose to join us, I hope you will find the Rebellion can apply your skills in a manner consitant with your ideaology."**

**The Melt Down cafÃ©**
Naryen shrinks away from Tar'ja as the grip on her arm tightens, the tension there matching the tension in the voice delivering the accusations "You Chose that life. You Let yourself be used." Naryen feels the tremors of anger through the hand squeezing her arm. Her gut twists and she averts her eyes from the hand on her arm, not able to even look there, let alone into the ownersâ€™ eyes.
The doubts that she tortured herself with the past few months raged with new life, charged from the energy of an ally, and lay into Naryen with renewed vigor. ***How didnâ€™t you know? You helped to subjugate one whole planet and kill people from your own! Why werenâ€™t you stronger! Why didnâ€™t you stay and stop them! Why didnâ€™t you save your people!*** Something there doesnâ€™t align and tries to be heard but the turmoil in her mind drowns it out as she listens further, torturing herself.
"You heard â€¦ the screams of the dying. â€¦ you are guilty of more..â€ she shrinks away again at that as that exact thing rages in her mind once more. â€œWhat would your parents say to that?" the image of their corpses, staring at her with dead eyes, mouth and their voices answer in her mind ***Why did you let them kill us?***
Naryen sobs as Tar'ja & Kasga continues. She lifts her head, when he's done, and, facing the wall with a far-away look on her face, says **â€œWe devoted ourselves to the Republic but it never seemed like we achieved what we were capable of. When the Emperor took control everything changed. We shifted our infrastructure to the Military and suddenly we were building and expanding and creating and achieving."** expression and tone are both full of pride **"Our officers, our troops, our ships, everything was some of the best in the Empire. Everything we did became part of the Imperial Military and we did it well!â€** She takes a shuddering breath, defeated **â€I just want to go home.â€** She recalls days spent with her parents touring the shipyards, playing on the southern glacier, project work with her instructors and teams throughout her university life, graduating at the top of her class, the pride on her parents faces. **â€to Varbrindal.â€** The name is spoken with longing and love and closed eyes that let a tear go down her cheek.

Dexter makes his way over to the side door before he realizes the others are still talking. Around the table the conversation becomes heated many have invested emotions with the recent events. Chase pauses during the conversation staring off into space, it becomes obvious that he is under some kind of stress as beads of sweat line his brow.
Nearby the closest table of patrons continues with their routine of drinking. They do not hear the conversation or have no interest with the people within your booth.
SBC-54 has not returned most likely still outside waiting for your group. Though only a few minutes have passed since the data pad video it is likely the droid is not even aware of the current dilemma within your group. It would even be considered that the droid would have been ordered to wait. Such a request to near strangers would not normally be taking lightly. As the tension mounts our heroâ€™s face real life concerns to work out.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-18 11:31:28)

Chase sat there watching Deidra and Tar'ja. Emotions were running high. From the sound of it Chase wondered if Deidra was going back out. Clearly something was stressing her greatly. He looked at the two of them and controled his breathing his focus slid into place and he reached out to touch the Force.
Raw emotions assulted him coming off from both of them. Unknown to him he began to stare off to the side. His lack of training was evident. Visions flashed before him. They were fragmented and he had trouble making sense of them. Time continued on an accelerated pace.
He could feel the stress on his body as he tried to interpret what was beig shown to him. In an instant he was flooded with the thought and emotions of both women. One and the same they were. So intertwined the two were it was as if they had lived through the same experience. ***What does it mean?*** He pleaded and the Force answered. in a way Chase could not imagine.
Screaming, the kind of screaming that makes the hairs on one's neck raise with fear. unmeasurable pain hit him from all directions. As smoke cleared he could detect the smell of death. Death that left no one untouched. Men, women and children that were clutched to a parents breast in an effort to save them fom a horrible ghastly end. Those that were not dead were running in a vain attempt to flee. Though they did not get far as deaths hand reached out and felled them where they were.
As quick as it began it was over. Chase sat there. A saddness washed over him as he looked back to the two. He had seen what they went through. ***Both of them. Is that right? Could they have both witnessed what happened. That would explain how Tar'ja knows what she does.*** He thought. It was still very confusing to him. He could still hear the screams and detect teh smell of burnt flesh. ***why not? the Force lead Kasga and I together. Why could it not lead Deidra and Tar'ja together. All of us for that matter?***
Running his hand over his face to wipe the sweat he felt on his face off he cleared his throat. **"You two were there together."**  He said. It wasn't a question, he stated it as fact. His voice grew stronger but kept low to the confines of the booth **"The chaos, screaming, people running. Dying, bodies everywhere. Men, women, children…none were spared. Crying. Trying to flee and being cut down. Nothing could be done to stop it."** He was looking at the two of them as he spoke. The vision of what he saw was evident on his face.
He took a deep breath. **"Nothing could be done to stop it."** Sweat still dotted his face. He looked like he was tired.

Dexter stops when he realizes there is no one behind him. "This is why I like to work alone." He turns around to look at his new friends he guesses is the term he could use. "My freinds I realize some of you have been though alot, but we have stuff that needs attending to and I would hate to miss that heavnly dinner that will more likly be waiting for us when the our work is done. So if we could please continue this some where else." Dexter doesn't want to be rude to his freinds but there is a time and place for everything and this is not it.

Kasga watches the human torment herself with ghastly memories. Her excavation of her past leaves her shaken and bordering on emotional collapse.
Having focused on Deirdra, Kasga had assumed that the others at the table were as well. Chase's monologue started in a normal fashion, but it's revelations were startling, leaving Kasga unsure and confused.
Grasping for Chase's last statement like a lifeline, Kasga continues speaking to Deirdra, **"You have experienced the Empire's brutality directly. It does not have to continue. It can't be fixed quickly, but incremental change is possible. It takes subtlety and careful planning, but the Empire can be opposed. With a sufficient organization, it can be overthrown. Entities like us who have had enough of the Empire's oppression can form resistance cells and act to counter the Empire as opportunities present themselves."**
Speaking aside, Kasga reveals some of his own uncertainty,**"The Rebellion may not be large enough to prevent other atrocities soon, but we can become so."**
Kasga returns to his own convictions,**"I know that if we do nothing, the Empire will have already succeeded. With no one opposing them, they are free to take more actions against civilian populations. You have skills that could help the Rebellion overthrow the Empire. I urge you not to give up on your feelings and despoil the sacrifices you have already made."**
The conversation seems so focused, that Dexter's attempt to interject passes by unnoticed.

**The Melt Down cafÃ©.**
Naryenâ€™s training and experience pulled her from her reverie, triggered by Chases change in breathing pattern and other outwardly observable behaviors, and she focused on him. All her doubts and fears slipped to one side suddenly, leaving them scrambling to fight from the background, as she took in everything that she could. She noted his wide-eyed expression of fearâ€¦ no, shock, like heâ€™s experiencing some horrible sights for the first time, the instability in his breathing, facial expressions even his skin tone. ***â€œWhatâ€¦?â€***
She watched Chase wipe the sweat from his face as he began to compose himself, noting the tear drying rapidly on her own cheek as he did, "You two were there together." he stated it with conviction as strength returned to his voice and he looked between herself & Tarâ€™ja. "The chaos, screaming, people running. Dying, bodies everywhere. Men, women, children...none were spared. Crying. Trying to flee and being cut down. Nothing could be done to stop it." He looked shaken from his ordeal. With a deep breath he spoke with more conviction, as the rest of his sweat dried on his face "Nothing could be done to stop it."
An entire chorus of frantic voices, in her mind, simply ceased to exist.
His conviction echoed the conviction in her mind, that she couldnâ€™t hear before, as she cleared her mind. General Order 21 was an executive order issued by the Emperor to a hierarchy of indoctrinated or oblivious people. A giant machine thatâ€™s purpose is only to do his bidding.
***â€œâ€¦for my toys to break so none of the other kids can useâ€™emâ€¦â€***
She closed her eyes, taking in a breath to steady herself, just as what she had witnessed registered. Her eyes snapped open and looked intensely into Chases face, ***He didnâ€™t speak from his own memory! He experienced it just nowâ€¦ fromâ€¦ fromâ€¦*** she had to consciously prevent her mouth from falling open ***â€¦ MY memory!?*** Training related to displays liked this surged with ferocity and she wrestled it back with effort. Instructor references to General Order 66, and mentions of behavior like this, echoed in her mind as she actively dismissed the impulse to draw on him.
Her free hand twitched. Once.
***No. I'm not one of his toys anymore.***
She just started to consider the violation of something so personal to her as her own memories when newly found and bolstered strength reached forward and focused on Kasgasâ€™ mentioning resistance cells and overthrowing the Empire. She cast her eyes down and closed them as she collected and composed herself.  ***Easy. One fight at a time … should we really shouldnâ€™t be talking about THAT here!?***
"The Rebellion may not be large enough to prevent other atrocities soon, but we can become so." Naryen looks, now, to the Duros sitting with them with widened eyes, perhaps even really seeing him for the first time. ***â€¦ â€œweâ€?*** Naryen finds her sensibilities assaulted from a new direction as she listens to the convictions from Kasga. "I know that if we do nothing, the Empire will have already succeeded. With no one opposing them, they are free to take more actions against civilian populations. You have skills that could help the Rebellion overthrow the Empire. I urge you not to give up on your feelings and despoil the sacrifices you have already made."
Naryen recalls her parents attending her graduation. The look of pride on their faces. ***And others.***
Her expression resolves itself to match her body language, of strengthening resolve, as she places a hand on Tarâ€™jasâ€™ still gripping her arm.
She looks at Tar'ja and speaks with a conviction her expression hasn't quite caught up to yet. **"I agree"** Her eyes soften with appreciation that she shares with quick glances to Chase and Kasga but pours out to Tar'ja as she squeeze her hand. ***Thank you.***
With another breath, this one sounding steadier, Naryen releases Tar'jas hand and wipes her own face.
**"I think we have someone waiting for us outside."**
***We.***

The voices of the others at the table were fairly distant to the Twi'lek whose focus was on to the human female that she was staring at. Vaguely she knew that they were helping, vaguely her hearing registered that Chase's breathing had changed again; her lekku twitching slightly in concern though his words did break through enough to startle her.
How did he know? how could he say that as though he had been there? how... Clearly there was more to him than what was seen on the outside, what that was though she wasn't sure, but she would find out. The Duros spoke up and again her mind trained to the human woman that she was clutching to. She had to realize that to stop the old memories was to do this right thing.
And then..the breakthrough as it were, "I agree" that was all she had said to start with and in it, in that gaze she could hear the 'Thank you' deep down. Tar'ja nods her head slowly and releases her arm, sitting back and against Chase's arm a tad more than she had prior.
"I think we have someone waiting for us outside." the human woman said and the Twi'lek had to agree, a slight nodding of her head "We don't want to keep them waiting anymore than they kept us." a Dry excuse for a joke but at least it was an attempt.

Though his strength was coming back Chase still felt a bit drained. He had never done that before. Perhaps his ability to use the Force was changing. Still without a master his training would be slow and arduous. ***Master Garet always said that training in the Force was never an easy thing. Why would it be any different now.*** 
He remembered the look on Deidra's face when she reflected on what she heard him say. The shock was there as she figured that he was talking about experience she and Tar'ja had together. If his current direction of thinking on where she came from was right, he might have trouble with her in the future. The fact that her hand twitched was indication of that. ***Better be careful Chase. You barely know these people. Your ability if known by the wrong people is a death sentence. Vader or his underlings will find you like before.*** He took a deep breath, ran a hand over his short hair and sat back as Kasga spoke. Chase figured that he'd make a good politician based on what he said. He had a way with words as did Tar'ja.
Watching Deidra Chase sees the shift in perception wash over her. A strength that was always there resurfaces. Looking into the Force he sees that the turmoil that was there moments ago has calmed down. It almost looks like an inner peace but he wasn't quite sure. Either way she didn;t look like she was torn anymore.
"I agree." She said. She looked at Kasga and Chase. He didn't need the Force to know what appreciation looked like.
Chase smiled. ***Good. Looks like the Force is with us after all. I should not have doubted.*** He thought as he felt Tar'ja lean back against his arm. A little more so than before. The thought of being careful was fleeting.
Deidra wiped her face with one hand as she spoke steadily. "I think we have someone waiting for us outside."
He looked at Deidra and nodded an affirmative. He gazed shifted to Tar'ja who sat close to him. She made an attempt at a joke and one corner of his mouth turned up in the half grin that was common for him to do. Looking into her eyes he knew he was gong to have some explaining to do. Question was how much to tell? He would have to wait and see. Besides they needed to be going.
**"Shall we go?"** He said to Tar'ja and then looked to Dexter and the others. **"I think we're finally ready."**

"Finally someone agrees with me on something. I shall right this down some where. If I live that long." Dexter moves thought the door way and starts to move around to the alley. "You know I saw this once in a holovid. The Hero dashing hero went to meet someone in an alley much ike this one, then out of no where the assians strock. Of course he defeated all of them in a glorious battle. Of course that would never happen in real life they would just pull out blasters and fill the area with blaster fire, but that won't happen here i think." Dexter rambles on alittle while longer not really careing if anyone is listening, he is just talking. Smileing while doing it.

Deirdra finally relaxed and agreed to join their group. Still other questions linger but they can be handled later. Dexter is clearly anxious to get moving.

Dexter trys to stay ahead of the group. making sure he is the frist to reach the alley way incase it is a trap. "And don't go asking Bandous about our last adventure together.

Next to him Kasga answers Dexter. "Great, you can take point. Who wants to make the run around the block to the other entrance?"
**"Well since we only have access to two exits, the front and side, we can only go two ways. If you want to go with Dexter maybe Deidra, Tar'ja and I can go out the side door. Is that ok with you two."**  He says to the table, the last being directed at the two women.

I stick out easily."**  He lowered his voice a bit for her. **"But it would be nice to stay together a bit longer."**  A corner of his mouth turned up a bit. He surprised himself with what he had said as he was never one to be *that* forward. The surprise showed on his face a bit

**The Melt Down cafÃ©.**
â€œWe don't want to keep them waiting anymore than they kept us." Naryen looks at Tarâ€™ja and displays a brief smile of appreciation for the humor, badly needed given the circumstances. ***â€â€¦weâ€¦â€***
Looking that the pair across from her she notes the body language and expressions. ***Ah, perhaps more than it initially seemed.*** An all too familiar hollow feeling expresses itself and for some reason various vague impressions of Thomas Lars added flavor to it. A look of introspection and a puzzled scowl flash across her face just as Chase speaks to Tarâ€™ja, "Shall we go?" then to the group at the booth "I think we're finally ready." Naryens blinks away the thought and expression, just before it starts to sour, allowing a little smile to return with a nod of agreement. ***â€â€¦weâ€¦â€***
Kasga looks around and comments "Yeah, we're ready to go, but that doesn't mean we have to have to be foolish about it. Why don't we look around a bit on our way? Maybe approach from a couple different directions." Naryen quickly recalls the layout of the cafÃ© and the block it sits in and considers approaches and bottlenecks and opens her mouth to voice her agreementâ€¦ just as she turns to look for Dexter and sees, instead, the front door swinging closed behind him. ***â€â€¦weâ€¦â€***
((OCC: If we are going ahead: ))
***He went in without back-up!*** Naryens expression calms, her face almost expressionless, and her eyes narrow, as she stands, checking the position and stability of her gear at the same time.

Kasga knew the group still has some coordination to do, but Dexter went running off too quickly. On the other hand Deirdra seemed to not hold back once her decision was made. At her command, Kasga jerked to obey, before making his movements more subtle. He would have to recommend more gentle manners of command when under cover.
Regardless, he slings his duffle bag over his shoulder, and follows her, keeping his hand near his Travotti service pistol and his eyes open.

Chase noticed Deidra's composure when they all realize that Dexter left the cantina without any of them. He shifted the bag slightly and felt the presence of his blaster pistol at his side and his lightsaber that was hidden on his person. Hopefully he would not have to use either of them.
Deidra stood her face was all business. With a commanding presence, one that Chase was surprised to see, she gave out orders to them like it was second nature. ***Some obvious military training there, officer maybe.*** He thought.
He nodded. **"Roger that, side door it is."** He walked beside Tar'ja to the door. He remembered what she had said about sneaking around. **"I'll go out first. This way you can cover me and stay unseen if need be. If I try and sneak around I'll just stick out even more."**  He said with a shrug. There was no attempt to protect her. He was relying on her to protect him in case the poodoo hit the turbofan. Chase hoped he had conveyed that meaning to her.
He put his hand on the door and opened it. ***Here we go.***

That brief pause of surprise on his face at his own words had her near laughing when all hell broke out. Sighing Tar'ja follows the others, nodding to Chase and stepping into the shadows of the door her hand moving to her blaster.

A few of the cantina patrons pause what they are doing to look up when Dexter yells across the room "My freinds I realize some of you have been though alot, but we have stuff that needs attending to and I would hate to miss that heavnly dinner that will more likly be waiting for us when the our work is done. So if we could please continue this some where else." Though the patrons quickly return to their drinks not wanting involvement in the affairs of outsiders. With talk of the empire and the rebellion you can not be sure if any one is listening in. Your senses tell you they are not.
With Dexter taking point he enters the alley through the side door. The rest of the group follows shortly after. Inside the alley scattered rubble and refuse wrinkle your noses. From this side of the cantina the sign pulses with energy sending sparks flying over the front entrance of the alley. Just as you open the door the silver protocol droid stands waiting.
â€œOh my, well welcome and thank you for coming. I trust you found your change?â€ The droids question is obviously a probing question to determine your stance on the situation.
A small patrol of troopers can be heard marching through the street. Noticing the group of troopers SBC-54 changes the subject. â€œSo twice a day you will tidy up out here.â€
The group of troopers passes by, one trooper pauses o look down the alley then moves on. Satisfied the patrol is gone SBC-54 resumes the topic. â€œSo how do you want to continue? Are you in or out?â€ The droids domineer has changed no longer the diligent servant, now more confident if thatâ€™s possible for a droid.

**OOC:** Ok with what we had planned and what Tru posted is a bit different so I'm trying to follow both ways as best as I can.
**IC:**
Standing door he hears Tar'ja off to his left. "I have your back..." Still looking at the door he gave a single nod. To be honest he was glad to have someone there. For too long he had been on his own. Even though he barely knew them he already felt safer if that was even possible.
"Nice view by the by." He barely heard the comment that was laced with a bit of humor. Deep down he hoped there was a bit of truth there as well. He cocked his head is if to turn and look at her but stopped and followed the others out with a smile on his face. ***Now isn't the time for that Chase.***
The smell of the alley assaulted his senses. Garbage lay scattered about their feet and up against the walls. Almost as if it was tossed out with the hope it would find it's way to the garbage cans. Ahead of them the same droid that had given them the datapad stood there.
â€œOh my, well welcome and thank you for coming. I trust you found your change?â€ Chase gave a single nod, his hand hovering near his blaster pistol.
Before any of them could speak a Imperial patrol passed by the opening of the alley. He pretended not to notice as the droid begain speaking again. â€œSo twice a day you will tidy up out here.â€ The patrol passed by with out giving them much of a thought. One paused to look but quickly left to join up with it's fellow troopers.
A moment passed and the droid spoke again with a different domineer. ***Interesting, there's more to this droid than I first thought.*** â€œSo how do you want to continue? Are you in or out?â€
chase felt Tar'ja's presence next to him. It was reassuring. **"I am in. The others will have to speak for themselves. I am also sure that there will be questions asked before we leave."**
He waited for the others to voice their intent. Even though it was decided inside when it was time to lay the cards on the table not everyone followed through.

***Dexterâ€™s behavior as a show-boater will either need to be reigned in or utilized. We shall see.*** Naryen recalls the terms used by the military for that. ***Bait. Target Drones. Casualties.*** The list continues.
Stepping into the alley Naryen is assaulted by the smell. Rot. Decay. Reminded her of crispy Wookie. Her nose curls slightly at the memory, not the smell. â€œOh my, well welcome and thank you for coming. I trust you found your change?â€ The droid is there to meet them. ***Kept you waiting?***
Naryen was just about to mention being short changed when the droidâ€™s behaviour shifted.

Recalling games played in the officers mess and demeanor showed at some officers dinner, Naryen tilts her head to one side, smirks and with a hand on her other hip says **â€œIâ€™m confident that weâ€™re *All-In*.â€** then pauses to widen her smile for a moment **â€œbut we have some questions and other matters that *will* be addressed first.â€** Looks to the street where troopers just passed then back to the droid to flesh out the ***Yeah, we are going to talk before we get any deeper.*** emphasis she put on â€œwillâ€. ***Should I mention the information I have?…*** **â€We need a little more information on what we are doing and whatâ€™s involved.

Kagsa follows Dierdra out toward the alley entrance. As they walk briskly along, Kasga casually does a perimeter scan looking for watchers or other droids. Satisfied no person or droid holds undue interest in the group, he continues down the alley. The oily smell of discarded petrochemicals fills the air. All organic pollutants have long since dissipated in the heat. Kasga recognizes several of them, but otherwise is unconcerned.
Once everyone gathers around the droid, Kasga leans back on the wall, keeping the clasp to his duffle at hand. The droid's questions are interrupted by the Imperial patrol, but the droid continues once they pass by.
As Deirdra speaks to the droid for everyone, Kasga just nods casually. She goes on to try and get more information from the droid. Kasga speaks up, **"Perhaps we should try to move this somewhere we can speak more freely."**

As the troopers pass by and they are unnoticed. Dexter again switches gears. "That was close. So what do you have for us or would you like to go somewhere where we would not be seen?"

Tar'ja sticks close to the shadows and Chase, making sure he was in her line of sight while still being able to see the droid and the exits. The droid's speech is typical of most droids, especially ones trying not to be careful of what is said.
The troops that walk by cause her hand to shift to her blaster, waiting for them to move on, only half listening to whatever it was the droid was saying as a reason for them all to be there; only when the last trooper passes does her hand relax slightly away from the blaster and her focus return to the droid â€œSo how do you want to continue? Are you in or out?â€ *That was new* her features shift to surprise, *maybe he's not a simple protocol droid.*
She lets the others speak, content to stay in the shadows and keep an eye out, yes eventually she'd need to show herself but for now...until they new more this would be fine. A thought strikes her as she shifts forward slightly, just enough to be heard by Chase "Kasga's right, this is too open for this type of conversation we need someplace quieter and far more private."

### **Yogi** (2009-03-23 16:39:10)

Chase stood there as the others spoke to the droid. He agreed with what the others had said. They needed more information and they needed to get it someplace other than out in the open alleyway. He reached out slightly with the Force. He could feel the presence of the others. The droid was there empty in the Force. To the best of his knowledge he felt no others nearby. He felt Tar'ja come a bit closer and heard her speak. "Kasga's right, this is too open for this type of conversation we need someplace quieter and far more private."
He simply nodded an affirmative and spoke to the droid again.
**"My friends make two good points. We have questions and a need to ask them in a place…"** Chase looked to both sides. **"…not so public. Can that be arranged?"**

### **master_Tru** (2009-03-24 08:12:08)

SBC-54 crosses his hands behind his back and paces a few steps as if in thought as your questions come through. Most likely a computational processing habit the droid picked up to fit in better with its designed focus group. As you examine the droid closer you notice the lack of restraining bolt. SBC-54 nods at the last few comments then stops pacing and looks at Dexter. The droid pauses a moment then with its metal hand pushes the Bothans data pad down. â€œI would rather not leave a trail, no notes for this mission if you please.â€
SBC-54 then turns and takes a few steps down the alley. Stopping at another side door the droid scans over the door then satisfied pulls off a patch of mess tape that was on the door seal. Opening the door SBC-54 looks inside moves a few carefully placed items from just inside the door to the side then turns back to your group. â€œInside if you would the maintenance closet has been undisturbed and should prove a safe area to continue our negotiations.â€
The droid steps to the side allowing everyone to enter the small room. Inside the maintenance closet its standing room only, along the walls selves hold cleaning supplies and replacement parts. The room has no windows only the one door and a small air duct from which you can hear its fan, the noise from it creates a constant low whine.
Once inside the droid closes the door behind him and nods to the group. â€œOn behalf of my employer I thank you for your time. I apologize for the subterfuge but in my line of business it is a necessity.â€ Looking to Deidra SBC continues â€œThe mission is one of peace though like many job offers one could take these days one not without an amount of danger. My employer will compensate you all for your time and skill but more importantly future employment would follow a successful mission. Of course there is also the satisfaction of doing the right thing.â€
The droid pauses again most likely programmed to allow some amounts of conversation to sink in. The droid scans your group as if looking for tell tale signs to continue. â€œI have been authorized to allow you some funds to purchase hyperspace capable transportation. I am afraid the amount will not be enough to outright buy a ship I am sure your groups combined skills will allows us to over come this first obstacle. I have also have the authorization to provide a brief explanation to outline the mission itself. In short a transport has recently crashed on Tatooine. I will provide general coordinates, the ships cargo is of great importance to our efforts. Our secondary objective will be to rescue any possible survivors.â€
SBC-54 lowers his head slightly â€œThough at this point its doubtful there would be any.â€ Curious that a droid would have so many mannerisms in common to humanoids. â€œI will accompany you for some of this mission including leaving Tatooine. I alone have the authorization to carry the coordinates for our departure destination. If you have any questions now is the time for them. Our time is short and if you are in please keep that in mind.â€ SBC stands scanning your group again. The closet is cramped though you do not see Chase and Tar`ja complaining as they each blush a new shade when they find themselves much closer then needed. As Chase mentally scans the group he notes a few surface emotions from the group and though the droid is a dead zone of the force it does hold a tinge of aura the force has or will play a part in this droid.

SBC-54's breif description set Kasga's mind a whirl. His expression betrays elation and hope. *A transport! I could get off this dust ball. We'd have to fix it. Then get fake permitting to allow us to deceive the Imperial fleet. It would need to be made combat ready in case we have to fight our way out.* Having run down his revelry, his expression returns to the more serious matter at hand.
Kasga talks cautiously, **"Why is the Empire not interested in the downed transport? Since they are not actively searching for it, why is our time frame so tight?"**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Rebaav** (2009-03-24 12:17:22)

**Just outside The Melt Down cafÃ©â€¦ in a closet with a droid.**
Naryen watches the droids behaviorisms and wonders if sheâ€™ll get to meet the person itâ€™s emulating. ***No restraining bolt? The people around here are really are apathetic!*** Naryens watches the droid physically lower Dexters PDA, impeding his efforts. Her eyes widen and she succeeds in not snickering, though not in keeping the smile from her face. She clears her throat with a fist over her mouth to stifle a cough and smooth her face, somewhat.
SBC-54 then moves to, and opens, a door requesting the group enter. Listening to the air system she wonders what acoustics algorithm sheâ€™d use to filter the conversation from a recording. She clears her head slightly with a mental sigh.
The droid closed the door behind the last of the group and then dispenses some pleasantry â€œOn behalf of my employer I thank you for your time. I apologize for the subterfuge but in my line of business it is a necessity.â€ she was not expecting and admission at all! She feels the attention of the droid focus on her and its tone shifts slightly â€œâ€¦Of course there is also the satisfaction of doing the right thing.â€ She grimaces at this familiar persuasive language and tries unsuccessfully to keep sarcasm from her thoughts. She nods for the droid to continue.
â€œâ€¦In short a transport has recently crashed on Tatooine. I will provide general coordinates, the ships cargo is of great importance to our efforts. Our secondary objective will be to rescue any possible survivors.â€ She considers how long it will take troopers attached to the Illustrious to hunt down fugitives. Not long enough to have this conversation. ***Just how common are crashes on this dust-ball anyway?*** SBC-54 lowers his head slightly â€œThough at this point its doubtful there would be any.â€ Naryens eyes narrow at this display by the droid. ***Was that added to help emotionally manipulate recruits?*** Sheâ€™s begins to look less receptive as this droid goes on.
â€œI will accompany you for some of this mission including leaving Tatooine. I alone have the authorization to carry the coordinates for our departure destination. If you have any questions now is the time for them. Our time is short, if you are in, please keep that in mind.â€
Naryen takes a breath and sets herself. ***â€â€¦ time is short,â€¦â€ Very well.*** Kasga asks "Why is the Empire not interested in the downed transport? Since they are not actively searching for it, why is our time frame so tight?" She acknowledges Kagas with a nod **â€Cargo important to his employer is likely just as if not more important to the Empire. If the crash was caused by Imperial military action then, with standard retrieval, weâ€™re already too late. This suggests the crash was caused by something else and we need to act before the local detachment is made aware of the nature of the cargo and moves to retrieve it. If local â€¦ privateers, obtain it then it becomes compromised, hence â€˜time is shortâ€™. This relegates us to a delivery service with added security.â€** Naryen regards the droid **â€I am relatively new to this line of work so Iâ€™ll have to default to your, admitted, experience as to how close I am, but Iâ€™ll confirm for myself that Iâ€™m interested and Iâ€™m in.â€**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-24 12:47:57)

The droid seems to contemplate their questions as it paces back and forth. The actions were odd especially for a droid. One thing he did notice was the lack of a restraining bolt. ***Interesting this droid must have complete confidence of whoever owns it.*** It nodded at the last couple questions then with a quick word to Dexter to put away his datapad.
Moments later they found themselves entering a cramped Maintenance closet. SBC-54 was apparently satisfied that the room had not been tampered with. looking around Chase saw what was standard for a closet such as this. When he was as far back as he could go he turned around only to see Tar'ja coming close with the others right behind her. He turned to the side to make a bit more room as she was forced to step close to make room for them. Trying to take a step back, to make a little room, his heel caught a can of some sort. Reaching out to keep from falling over his right hand shot out and grasped her around the waist. The movement caused the two of them to become even closer. His face reddened a bit as he recovered and tried to let go in the cramped quarters. He was almost successful. **"Excuse me."** He said quietly to her as he tried to find more room. There was none. He took a breath.
SBC-54 began to talk again as Chase tried to focus on the droid. It wasn't as easy as it should have been. The slight shade of red still hadn't left his face, anyone in the room could see it easily if they looked. It almost made him blush more as his hand moved against her back as he tried to rearrange his position a bit. He finally gave up on moving. ***Give up chase you're only going to make it worse.*** He thought as he closed his eyes for a second when he heard the droid. "...doing the right thing" ***Wrong time to hear those words.*** He thought as he opened his eyes and found himself looking down into Tar'ja's blue eyes. ***Definitely the wrong time.*** He held his breath.
In an effort to actually concentrate on the droid he turned his head to look to the side. The whole time SBC-54 spoke he was listening but he was acutely aware of how close Tar'ja was. The mission was somewhat straight forward. A downed transport, cargo and possibly survivors to be recovered. SBC-54 would accompany them for part of the mission as it carried the coordinates for departure.
"If you have any questions now is the time for them. Our time is short and if you are in please keep that in mind.â€ SBC-54 said looking them over.
Kasga and Deidra both spoke up. Deidra made a good point about the crash and may have answered Kasga's question. What was important what that she was in.
He reached out to the others with the Force. Surface emotions was all he got mostly. he could feel that Kasga was happy at the thought of a ship. Deidra seemed like she just wanted to get going with things. Dexter he wasn't sure. Tar'ja he didn't even try to read. He didn't have to. He could tell by the matching shade of red she wore.
Chase looked at the droid and spoke from the back of the closet. **"Count me in. Where did this transport go down? Are we going to need a ship to get there because getting one quickly might not be easy."**
Close they were quite close.

### **zerah** (2009-03-24 13:09:37)

Tar'ja had continued to stick to the shadows as the droid moved to the door furthur down to check it out if it was safe enough she suppossed. Although craming into the small closet wasn't great for most she wasn't about to complain when she was so close to Chase she could actually feel him breathing.
He trips at that point and *oh stars he's holding my waist* Nope, wasn't going to complain one bit, though she did -try- to give him some space...it's not as though she was trying to get as close to him as possible when she half shifted and ended up leaning on him more...really. Her lekku twitch with emotion that matches the red on her cheeks.
*A transport..so this was a rescue mission? well, a rescue cargo mission.* She shifts slightly in an attempt to get the things on the shelves to stop poking her lekku and back, causing her to shift cloaser to Chase, again. "Sorry.." she says softly, a blush to her cheeks and something akin to not completely being sorry in her tone.
"Count me in. Where did this transport go down? Are we going to need a ship to get there because getting one quickly might not be easy." oh stars she could actually feel very breath he took for that...was he breathing awkwardly or was that her?
They were so close, *focus..* really really close, *focus Tar'ja* who knew her heart would ever beat this fast when she wasn't on a job, the briefing was indeed the hardest thing she had ever had to focus on in her life...*oh Tar'ja…that was bad wording..* she looks up to those striking blue eyes and gulps *very bad wording*

### **galenbd** (2009-03-24 22:14:01)

Deirdra's ideas made sense, but the droid had not confirmed it. Kasga suspected that the droid's handler wanted them to go after this "cargo" without really knowing it's purpose. Kagsa decided he would try and figure that out when they got there. Preferably with space between himself and the droid. Not in this closet.
Kasga speaks to Deirdra, nodding toward the droid, **"His owner doesn't want to provide transport himself, and folks won't rent to a droid. There's another problem of permitting. We'd have to find a black market dealer to buy or rent from. That's what Chase and I did to get to Dosenna's farm. I just don't know where to find that guy in Mos Eisley yet."**
Looking toward the droid, Kasga asks, **"What's our bankroll for the retrieval?"**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **master_Tru** (2009-03-25 08:14:05)

SBC stands looking to each of you as your questions are posed. Turning to Kasga SBC replies â€œI did mention dangers though I am sure a member of the Reapers would have little to fear from the empire. Unfortunately Admiral Saycho is very thorough itâ€™s only a matter of time before his troops locate the downed transport.
At Deidra`s comment SBC turns to the human woman to answer â€œThough it is true the empire can be efficient I have found that leadership within the empires ranks varies greatly. Up until recently the local detachment has carried out the search in failure. Added to the complexity of the mission the ship is in a dangerous area of the great dune sea which is prone to sand storms.â€
As Chase fumbles through a response SBC raises a metal hand as if to emphasize a point. SBC lowers its hand when it notices the humanoid interaction between Chase and Tar`ja. The droid shakes its head â€œA ship will be needed to leave the planet. Most any form of transportation will get you to the crash site. Finding it will be another matter. â€œ
SBC-54 nods as your group begins to acknowledge agreement of the mission pausing the look at Tar`ja then Dexter in turn both who have not agreed as of yet. Holding its hand out to the group SBC asks â€œThe data pad if you please.â€ Deidra hesitates then hands the droid the pad. Entering a long series of code the droid accesses a map stored of the pad. The map shows an area of the great dune sea outlined in a red dotted line covering a fairly large area. â€œOur intelligence has the transport somewhere in this location.â€ With another series of code the droid overlays a blue dotted line similar to the red but only marginally crossing through one section. â€œOur intelligence also shows the local imperial search grid which as you can see can be avoided.â€
SBC pauses and looks to Deidra â€œYour entire group has yet to agree to the mission. Do you speak for this group?â€ At Kasga`s next question SBC states â€œThe funds are still on route if you are all in you will know soon.â€

When SBC speaks to Kasga, Naryen doesnâ€™t even try to look disinterested. â€œI did mention dangers though I am sure a member of the Reapers would have little to fear from the empire. Unfortunately Admiral Saycho is very thorough itâ€™s only a matter of time before his troops locate the downed transport.â€ ***So, Kasga is already attached to the terror â€¦ Rebellion, as part of a named cell even, and Admiral Saycho is involved.*** At the mention of his name Naryens face blanks but her eyes glitter with restrained anger. Her right hand curls into a fist and tenses. She forces the hand to uncurl and she looks at the droid as it now addresses her. ***What else do you and â€˜your employerâ€™ know?***
â€œThough it is true the empire can be efficient I have found that leadership within the empires ranks varies greatly.â€ Naryen recalls her experience in the command and control tower during the Varbrindal massacre and a bitter expression flashes across her face. ***Well, arenâ€™t you well informed.*** â€œUp until recently the local detachment has carried out the search in failure. Added to the complexity of the mission the ship is in a dangerous area of the great dune sea which is prone to sand storms.â€ ***Well informed indeed!*** Naryen is trying hard not to stare as her opinion of the â€¦ Rebels, propagandized by the Empire, is reevaluatedâ€¦ again.
â€œâ€¦Finding it will be another matter. â€œ ***Ah, finally something he doesnâ€™t know.***
â€œThe data pad if you please.â€ Naryen swings her pack around and removes the droids pad, pausing as she considers her own and the information it contains, then hands droid itâ€™s pad. She watches, impressed, as it handles the technology and the intelligence. ***Line of work indeed.***
â€œYour entire group has yet to agree to the mission. Do you speak for this group?â€ The question causes her pause. Naryen clears her throat. **â€œFor the moment, at least, I canâ€™t speak for anyone here but myself. I will assist anyone that agrees to take part in this.â€**

The briefing continued there in the cramped closet. Despite the closeness to Tar'ja, which he would swear that she actually leaned against him a bit more, he managed to stay on topic despite the pace at which his heart was beating. He noticed the shaking of SBC's head when it looked at the two of them. ***What is with this droid It's almost human in its manners.*** He thought. It was highly unusual but it did answer him. â€œA ship will be needed to leave the planet. Most any form of transportation will get you to the crash site. Finding it will be another matter.â€œ
He then realized the picture that he and Tar'ja must be painting. He managed to find a place to place his left foot and actually shifted to the left a bit. It took a good portion of his body away from her but they were still together at the hips. His hand didn't leave her though. Despite the situation and the briefing his hand on her waist and the contact they had was having an effect on him. Something that he hadn't experienced in some time, since before he met Master Garet. ***What a time fort this to happen. Get a grip.***
SBC continued when he got the datapad. â€œOur intelligence has the transport somewhere in this location.â€ With another series of code the droid overlays a blue dotted line similar to the red but only marginally crossing through one section. â€œOur intelligence also shows the local imperial search grid which as you can see can be avoided.â€
Chase nodded he was surprised as to how well informed their potential employer was. This was good as bad information ofter lead to trouble.
SBC posed a question to Deidra and answered one from Kasga before the Formal Imperial had a chance to answer. He waited to hear her response which came after a slight pause. â€œFor the moment, at least, I canâ€™t speak for anyone here but myself. I will assist anyone that agrees to take part in this.â€
She is a leader that much he could tell. He also noticed that she had some trepidation about stepping up to take the lead.
***This has got to be hard for her. Changing sides like this. Her whole world is upside down. Much like mine was a few years ago when I met Master Garet.*** The thought of Master Garet made him think about what was happening right now with Tar'ja. Garet would have strong words for him right now. Especially how a Jedi has to control his emotions. ***Easier said than done.*** He thought as his hand was touching her slim waist. ***Easier said than done.***
He looked at Dexter and then back to Tar'ja with her blue eyes wondering what both had to say about joining the mission.

Deep breathes and focusing on words and sounds were the only things keeping her mind in one place and not on Chase..well not completely on Chase. Inside her mind she had begun to berate herself on the actions, and more so the emotions going on. She'd been alone and working alone since she was a teen she knew better than to get so attached, especially so quickly. Still there was just something about him...
The movement of the droids hand caught her eye and her attention, glaring at it when it shook it's head at the sight of them *what's wrong, too human for you?*
â€œYour entire group has yet to agree to the mission..." something else that had her mind twitching, she wasn't stupid, and if there's one thing that had been drilled into her over the years it was don't agree to anything until you know as much as possible. What the mission is..easy, a rescue and salvage. Where the mission is, again easy it was in the sand planet. How would the mission be carried out, a ship we would have to find, can't buy a ship which would put others in danger if there's another pilot and another share down. That brought up the last question, how much was the pay; and that was still not determined.
She looks over the group, they wouldn't all be getting much...then again this wasn't the old days, she needed to half ignore that rule. They would get paid she hoped, but this was for a greater cause, something she had wanted to do, be something better then what she was, and now..make the world a better place for Lyn...she glances up to those blue eyes as her thoughts add in that it would be nice to make the world safe for someone else, and maybe a few others to come; before those thoughts were shoved into the deep corners of her mind, this wasn't the time *and you don't fully know him to be having those thoughts* her mind supplied.
Still...."I'm in." she says simply, looking to the droid with a glint before again looking up to Chase, he may have moved but it still felt like she was against him...yes...it would be nice for things to come.

Still listening to the others SBC processes the data unsure of its importance for the time being. The droid nods to each of you as you all give your in vote to the mission at hand. "Excellent my employer will be very pleased. If you are successful more opportunities for such employment would be promised, my employer has no love for the empire something I think you all have in common."
SBC then notes Kasga`s tension tilting his head to the side the droid studies the behavior for a moment. "You sir only need to agree once and I thank you for your co-operation. In fact the rebellion thanks you all." SBC passes the data pad back to Deidra "Take this for the information, I have already deleted the video file but the map remains. We should split up at this point. I will see to the funds and the rest of you should begin shopping for a ship capable of hyper space travel. I am not sure how much I will be able to acquire the source changes from time to time. We should meet back here at your both in one hour. From there I will inspect the ship then the mission can begin."
SBC opens the door and steps out already one route the droid slows and turns back. "If you have no further need of me I will proceed to my part of the arrangement?"

Chase looked at Tarja as she gave her response for joining the mission. "I'm in." She said as she looked at SBC for a second. When she looked up ay him he met her gaze with the half smile he had given her several times already. He gave here a simple nod. He was glad that she had said yes. The look on his face was easy to read.
She made his heart race there was no question in that and judging by the way she had also been blushing figured he may have had the same effect on her. Yet they had just met. ***One day at a time Chase. This is all real quick. You donâ€™t even know her, nor she you.*** He thought but when he looked into her eyes he quickly forgot about just meeting her.
Looking Dexters way when he echoed Tarâ€™jaâ€™s statement of agreeing they all finally knew that they were all in on this, all in on taking action against the Empire. His mentioning of poking around to find out some info sent alarms off in his head. If he went around like he was in the cantina they were doomed to fail before they even got started.
"Excellent,â€ SBC said. â€œmy employer will be very pleased. If you are successful more opportunities for such employment would be promised, my employer has no love for the empire something I think you all have in common."
Reacting to Kasgaâ€™s comment the droid continued on cool as always. You sir, only need to agree once and I thank you for your co-operation. In fact the rebellion thanks you all." Chase watched the Droid pas the datapad back to Deidra. "Take this for the information, I have already deleted the video file but the map remains. We should split up at this point. I will see to the funds and the rest of you should begin shopping for a ship capable of hyperspace travel. I am not sure how much I will be able to acquire the source changes from time to time. We should meet back here at your both in one hour. From there I will inspect the ship then the mission can begin."
***One hour. Not much time to work with.***
SBC then opened the door and stepped out. Before taking another step it turned back. "If you have no further need of me I will proceed to my part of the arrangement?"
Chase shook his head no and waited for the others to either ask any questions or wait and let the droid go. When it was gone he looked around.
**â€That is no ordinary droid.â€** He said not really expecting a response as he was sure that they all noticed its almost human like quirks. **â€One hour doesnâ€™t give us a lot of time to find a ship. Especially if we donâ€™t know what we have to work with for credits. Ship dealer or something less reputable might get us what we need. Anyone been on this dustball long enough to know their way around?â€**
He stood there, still close Tarâ€™ja even though there was a bit more room since the droid left, he picked up on their scattered emotions but there wasnâ€™t enough to sense anything. He waited to see what the others had for ideas on acquiring a ship. ***Now weâ€™re going to see how well we can work together. It ought to be interesting.***

*He has such lovely eyes…* in all the commotion of getting a new mission the only thing she could think about were how nice his eyes are. Only really snapping out of things when the droid left and Chase spoke.
"Yes...odd that it had such human emotions, rather curious how it was programed. I do wonder what it's full purpose is, something like that can't possibly be a simple messenger."
Tar'ja hums in thought of where to go to get a pilot and a ship, maybe the best course was the easiest. "perhaps we should ask in the Cantina if anyone knows of a pilot and work from there?"

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-30 14:47:48)

Chase listened as Tar'ja commented on the droid. She made a good point. It wasn't just a messenger droid as its programming was far to advanced.
He listened to her hum as she seemed to be in thought. "Perhaps we should ask in the Cantina if anyone knows of a pilot and work from there?"
The Cantina was a good idea for finding a ship but not a pilot. **"That might work for a ship Tar'ja. We already have a pilot."** He nodded towards Kasga. **"Besides I doubt that we can bring in someone else. Too much of a security risk for the job and our employer."**
Either way time was ticking. From what he had heard at Dosennaa'a farm Dexter had been on Tatooine for a while. Maybe her had some knowledge of Mos Eisley and where to find a ship. The only bad thing about getting going was that they would have to leave the closet.

Naryen patiently watches the droid go through its motions. "If you have no further need of me I will proceed to my part of the arrangement?"
***On this dustball that you seem to know like the back of your hand, you bet I do!*** **â€Iâ€™m curious, since we are pressed for time and Iâ€™m new to this area, do you have any contact information you could provide us with?

### **galenbd** (2009-03-30 17:50:42)

The droid response is ludicrous in the extreme. *An hour to find a ship that will pass the droid's inspection.* His mind reels from the suggestion. At least Chase knows he can fly whatever they find. Still any ship they find has to be able to fool the Imperials. That's not going to be easy with that Admiral around.
Kasga speaks up, **"The ship you are asking for has very specific characteristics. Us just getting that ship will expose our intentions. We would have to would build it to stay under the radar. Succeeding in the longer term mission will require time. An hour to find that is unreasonable."**

### **ganthet** (2009-03-31 10:54:03)

"Agreed trying to find a ship in an hour is kind of unreasonable but we don't have much choice in the matter." Dexter goes over in his head what they might need to find the ship fast and get away with what ever it is they where after. "Ok frist we are going to transport out to the site, speeder truck would be nice. Second I need to find a way to go get into some kind of security network if there is anything to know about a downed ship the locals or ISB will have something on it. Other wise we can ask around and see what we come up but that is going to take time, and we don't have alot of that." Dexter smiles at his friends. "Piece of spice cake. Now anyone have a ship we can use?"

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **master_Tru** (2009-03-31 11:21:27)

The droid pauses to calculate its response to Deidra`s question. Then states matter of factually "I have only recently landed on this planet as well. There are many vendors of all sorts both honest and not who provide services and products in the form of transportation."
As Kasga makes his statement SBC turns and continues. "Then we will have already failed. In my experience one is doomed to fail if one does not even try." The droid turns and begins to walk away. "I will meet back here with you in one hour, successful or not."
A moment later the droid is gone leaving your group stuffed inside a maintenance closet. The soft rhythmic music can be heard inside the cantina as can the pulsing sign outside sending sparks to the ground. On the streets vehicles can be heard traveling through daily routines as locals attempt an honest living on a chaotic dust ball.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-03-31 12:07:15)

SBC answered Deidra's question unfortunately it was not the answer that they had wanted to hear. ***Stang what does this droid expect from us? Miracles?***
Kasga soon followed stating that they would need more time in find such a ship. The droid in a human like nature answered. "Then we will have already failed. In my experience one is doomed to fail if one does not even try." The droid turns and begins to walk away. "I will meet back here with you in one hour, successful or not." the droid left leaving them standing in the closet.
As Dexter spoke Chase cocked his head a bit something SBC said made him think. ***'Then we will have already failed. In my experience one is doomed to fail if one does not even try.' I've heard that before. I know it.*** He thought as he ran a hand through his short hair. He had heard those words before but he had no recollection of when or where. He racked his brain over them. ***Then we will have already failed. In my experience one is doomed to fail if one does not even try.*** It bothered him that he could not remember.
He repeated them out loud. **"Then we will have already failed. In my experience one is doomed to fail if one does not even try."** He looked at the others. Despite being so close to Tar'ja he was now thinking clearly. **"I've heard those words before but I can't remember where. It's familiar that much I know."**
He sighed as he thought about the situation and the last words that Dexter had said about acquiring ship. He wondered if Dosennaa might have any idea on where to find one. It was then that he remembered the ship that was at the farm. He snapped the fingers on his right hand and pointed at Deidra.
**"The ship at the farm, what about that one? It's a transport and hyperspace capable. The owner is dead right? It's not like the little children will be flying it. We might be able to buy it. What do you think?"** He looked around the small closet at the others. ***I don't know why didn't think about that ship before?*** He thought.

Kasga is again stunned from the droid's answer. That droid has no understanding of what is involved in running this blockade. Licensing and passenger manifest are needed. Weapons in case the scam doesn't pan out. That droid's mission will still fail if we get blasted to ions in our attempt.
Kasga thinks backs to the farm. Incredulious, Kasga says, **"That thing? I thought it was a derilict. Let's go check it out."**

### **zerah** (2009-04-01 13:48:39)

Tar'ja nods her head at the mention of the ship "It flies well, it got us here without any trouble, granted I don't know how it handles to fly since it was pre-programed but if it was a smooth fly on auto it should be smooth on manual.
She looks up to Chase then the others, at least they did have an option of a ship if they could take it, and a few pilots already in the group.

"Well we have a ship to use. Now all we need is transport to the site and the location of the site itself. IfI could get to a terminal I might beable to locate that. Anyone want help me with that part. The others can get the transport and ready the ship." Dexter pulls out his data pad and starts to go over a few things. "We need to get moving people there is not alot of time for use to debate this." Dexter starts to walk out of the alley turning a direction and heading further away from the group. He has found something that he can do and he has set his mindon doing it.
((OCC: Dexter needs actess to a terminal to get any info he can from the ISB or the local Authoritys. Even gangsters would be great.))

**Just outside The Melt Down cafÃ©â€¦ in a closet with a droid.**
â€œThere are many vendors of all sorts both honest and not who provide services and products in the form of transportation.â€ A nicely preprogrammed answer if ever there was one. ***Now thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d expect from a droid.***
Naryen, still holding out the pad & failing to keep the smirk off her face, takes in the reactions of the group. Lowering her arm she watches Chaseâ€™s expressions change as he wrestles with, and fails to pin down, a memory. The contrast to this display reminds her of the incident in the booth ***What was he doingâ€¦***
"That thing? I thought it was a derilict. Let's go check it out." ***Task-at-hand to the rescue!***
She looks then at Tar'ja as she voices her impression of the ship. ***So thatâ€™s how you got here.***
**â€I wish we had more than one option. Iâ€™d prefer to leave that ship where it is, should Dossanna need to evacuate her farmâ€¦â€** A flurry of grotesque, some imagined some not, scenarios flash through her mind invoking a flinch **â€â€¦but without investing the time to firm up contacts around here I expect the only thing we would succeed in obtaining is unwanted attention.â€** Being new to this kind of thing she pauses and looks around the room to take in any cues from the people around her, hopefully more experienced. **â€I donâ€™t know if the people here are accustomed to out-of-towners looking for transport off-world or not and finding out the hard way would likely be fatalâ€¦ or Imperial in nature.â€** Her gaze rests upon Tar'ja, appealing to someone eles with 1st hand knowledge, to illustrate the point.
**â€Perhaps splitting up would work best for this? A pilot to evaluate the ship could accompany Tarâ€™ja, who is already somewhat familiar with it, and the rest of us could â€¦â€** She looks at Dexter with an oddly blank expression. **â€â€¦ make some *subtle* inquiries just in case something else can be arranged.â€** She then continues to look around as she speaks. **â€As long as you could check it out and get back here within the hour weâ€™ll try not to arrange a running firefight.â€** What was meant to be something lighthearted falls flat from her mouth. ***Unless Saycho is picking off anything that moves off-worldâ€¦*** 
"We need to get moving people there is not alot of time for use to debate this." Dexter starts to walk out of the alley turning a direction and heading further away from the group.
Naryen nearly gapes after him.

As Dexter walks off, Kasga just shakes his head. He turns and looks to Deirdra, **"I agree, I'd rather not take it if it leaves the innocents more exposed. The droid has not really given us much choice. We should try and explain that to the droid. I doubt it'll understand. I'll be happy to go over the ship and report back."**
Turning toward Chase, Kasga mentions, **"On our way in, you mentioned you weren't real good at the tech thing. Perhaps you should go with Deirdra to help look after.."** He nods towards Dexter's retreating form. **"our problem child."**

---

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-04-01 17:02:35)

**In the maintenance closet at the Melt Down cafe**
Chase listened to the others as they talked about the ship. Kasga was all for it but had some doubts as to its age but Tar'ja backed up the notion with what she knew of it. He nodded as he remembered the kids talking about arriving in the ship when he was playing with them. ***Kids, they are always so honest. Too bad everyone could not be that way.*** It was a nice wish but with the way things were sometimes the less that was known about you the better.
It seemed liked they all wished the ship could stay at the farm for the people there but the reality of finding a ship in an hour was slim to none. Deidra suggested splitting up. Tar'ja to go to the ship with a pilot, Kasga, and the three of them do some snooping around. It wasn't a bad idea as they could cover more ground that way. Dexter seemed to have an idea and just started to walk off again. Chase watched the reaction of Deidra and Kasga and just smiled and gave a shrug. ***There he goes again.***
Kasga looked at him. "On our way in, you mentioned you weren't real good at the tech thing. Perhaps you should go with Deirdra to help look after..." He looked at Dexter's direction. "...our problem child."
He nodded. **"Works for me. Let me give you my comm frequency. It's only a short range comm but it's encrypted.** He gave it to the three that were there as Dexter was already off saving the galaxy.
He looked at Deidra, ***This ought to be interesting.*** He thought before he spoke. **"We should catch up to him."** Dexter off by himself was kinda scary but maybe he was good at what he does.
He looked to Kasga and then to Tar'ja, as he did his features softened as he looked into her blue eyes. ***She's beautiful, plain and simple. Face it Chase you're going to have to sooner or later.*** He would have liked to have gone with her to the farm but like Kasga said he wasn't too good with tech or piloting for that matter. **"Be careful both of you. I'd hate to see this all end before we even get started.** Though the words were for both of them he hoped Tar'ja caught their subtle meaning.
He gave the Twi'lek a smile and then looked back to Deidra. **"Shall we head after him."** He grabbed his gear and made himself ready.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-04-01 17:45:16)

Tar'ja listens quietly, something training and long hours in a cramped space had taught her. Listen to everything and stay quite while others were finalizing a plan.
Dexter's voice was next addressing Chase, "On our way in, you mentioned you weren't real good at the tech thing. Perhaps you should go with Deirdra to help look after...our problem child." Looking up to him as he answers with a confirmation of the good idea, Tar'ja's lekku rose and fell with her breath of a sigh
*Shame really….would have been nice to have a little time with him without the others, interesting that one is..though..there will be other times.*
"Be careful both of you. I'd hate to see this all end before we even get started." Looking to those eyes, *so beautiful*, she could understand, double meanings, hidden words, things you say when you can't say. She nods and smiles softly, another rare true smile "Be careful out there."
Looking over to her new partner in crime as it were she smirks "Well shall we get going then? We can hope all we like that the others will find a ship, but till then the one back at the farm is the only one we have. Maybe they even have another means of escape we don't know about."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-04-01 21:48:12)

Chase gives out his com frequency. Kasga dials it in, but responds, **"That should work around town. You'll have to disable the encryption. Mine is only citizen rated so I can't decode it."**
Chase and Tar'ja say goodbye, and Tar'ja talks optimistally about their task.
**"Yeah, let's go. We'll see what we see."**, Kasga replies. He steps out of the maintainence shed and hikes his duffle up on his shoulder a bit more. As Tar'ja catches up, he questions, **"You wouldn't happen to know of a more cautious route back to the farm? We should take some care to hide our movements."**

Tar'ja blinks at him "Well, shadow-walking as always worked well for me. Considering the suns..." she looks up and hums "there should be plenty of shadows from here to at least the end of town, from there I'm not sure."
Looking back to the male beside her raises a brow "how is your shadow-walking?"

### **master_Tru** (2009-04-02 08:20:52)

Heading off in separate directions your two groups nod to each other as you begin your trips. Tar`ja and Kasga heading back to he farm house and the rest wondering around the city`s market center. The droid SBC is already clear out of site lost in the crowd with its mechanical determination to complete its task with calculated precision.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tar`ja takes the lead while Kasga follows her skilled lead. The side streets and alleys prove to hold the few shadows under the twin suns. With a little extra time the duo weave between the city`s streets bypassing a few storm trooper patrols and check points. At the city`s limit a short climb gets you outside and on the desert floor.
Out on the desert floor there is little to conceal ones movements except for the endless sea of dunes. Traffic in the desert is light with only the odd transport barreling into the desert. With a brisk pace you are able to traverse the distance to Dossanna`s farm in only a short twenty minutes.
Looking over the farm house from a near by dune you can see that the place is as much as you left it. Children play near to the farm while others sit in class learning the daily schedule. Even from here you can see that the Not To Shabby is gone. Scanning the surrounding area its no where to be seen.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chase and Deidra rush after Dexter to catch up to the sometimes rash Bothan. Dexter had made it out on to the street and was looking around for the best direction to go. On the ground and in the air various transports make there way through. The make shift buildings line the streets many of which serve as private landing bays for off world and local ships alike.
The merchants along the streets sell most anything from food stuffs to weapons. As you make your way through trying to figure out the best course of action many merchants ply their wares:
- From the back of a large Ronto two Jawa`s trade scrap metal and a few droids, both older model labour droids. "Utinni utinni!" One yells as it motions to the pile of scrap laid out around the ronto.
- Under the shade of an over hanging balcony a Toong merchant bellows "Come one come all I have the finest Rill dogs around. Or if you prefer I also have a large supply of Funnel juice wet your lips with some of the best pricing around."
- Hovering over a speeder and standing before a large open lot a Toydarin shouts his wares "I`ve got speeders carts parts and more. Not enough you say well I say no. You wants it I gots it and if I don`t gots it I gits it just for you." In the lot the Toydarian has piles of random parts scrap a few speeders and even a ship, under a pile of scrap metal. "Come on over I Fosso`s will treat you to a deal."
Throughout the streets locals and visitors shop the market street with only the odd storm trooper patrol giving a random shake down. It has been about twenty minutes since your group split up and you have passed by dozens of merchants selling mostly similar wares.

**DOSENNAA's FARM**
Kasga kicks sand in frustration. **"Well, that was a wild bantha chase."**
He turns away from the farm, looking up toward the sky. His right hand, sheilded from the view of the children, draws his blaster, thumbs the switch to stun, then reholsters it. Turning back and walking toward the farm, Kasga sighs, **"Lets go see if Dosennaa knows why or when that ship left."**

<strong>In a closet with a handful of near strangers just outside a barâ€¦ yeah, just like it sounds.</strong>
Naryen, rather stunned by Dexters display, cues into Kasga, "â€¦I'll be happy to go over the ship and report back." ***The self identified pilot, good.***
Turning to Chase, Kasga suggests "On our way in, you mentioned you weren't real good at the tech thing. Perhaps you should go with Deirdra to help look after.." He nods towards Dexter's retreating form. "our problem child." ***A problem child that may get us all killed!*** Recalling whatâ€™s done to Imperial officers within the Navy, that act like that, Naryen shows a smiles that is quickly washed away with a bitter grimace. Chase nodded in answer. "Works for me. Let me give you my comm frequency. It's only a short range comm but it's encrypted.â€ Naryen noted the comm freq then realized sheâ€™ll need to either obtain a civilian comm or get hers hacked so as not to be tracked on Imperial systems.
Chase addressed her next "We should catch up to him." then "Shall we head after him." With a nod Naryen looked around, sensing consensus and walked to the door. Stopping there she turned, looking like she wanted to say something then settling for something spoke with a conveyed sense of confidence **â€œLuck to us all.â€** then walked after Dexter as quickly as she felt would draw the least attention.
**In bustling downtown Mos Eisley&#8230; I think.**
Naryen, assuming her best â€œjust another civilianâ€ posture as they peruse the locals. The layout is ramshackle, to be polite, but the appearance of private landing bays implied just what SBC had mentioned: could be anything but possibly paying attention to those that seem to be doing modestly well would yield modest results. Too well implies favours behind the scenes and not well implies unreliability and desperation. ***I am so out of my element here and I wish I had a concealed comm.!!***
Upon noticing the storm troopers attention to the locals she stops to one side of the street & motioned for others attention to step aside with her. As soon as they do, without preamble, she curls up to Chase and imitates the kind of behaviors sheâ€™s seen joy-girls, among others, display towards troops on leave. Her tone switches between nearly harsh clinical detachment to drunkard schoolgirl with a side of rampaging hormones. Flashing a glittering smile punctuated by the occasional pout and fluttering eyes with undulating vocalizing that match the gyrations of her hips against Chase leg, does provide some interesting contrasts as she switches gears.
In a conversational volume pitched just enough for the people immediately around the trio: **â€œOh do we have to leave so soon? *giggle* Câ€™mon just one more night puleeeze?â€** Grabs Chases tunic and pulls him in tight to her. (((OOC: Though she does dress androgynously there is *nothing* andro about the firm curves from this pocket sized woman being rubbed against Chase which, now pressed, overcome the clothing without any problems at all. ))) She, rather histrionically, lays her head on Chases shoulder and heaves a moaning sigh, shivering a little, and faces Dexter. With her voice now pitched for just them, and barely moving her mouth beyond the dreamy smile, she says **â€I suggest we look for a supplier that seems to have enough stock for transports, theyâ€™d know who we should talk to for transport off-world.â€** She lets out another giggle and squirms again.
(((OCC: >:D )))

**Mos Eisley: Merchant row.**
They separated Chase gave them a wave and a smile to Tar'ja. ***May the Force be with both of you.*** He thought as he turned around and walked beside Deidra. Looking ahead there was no sign of the droid.
**"Lets hurry up so he doesn't get too far ahead."** He quickened his pace to match his words. They quickly found Dex in the street as he was looking for the best way to go. Chase looked around, it was busy. Vehicles of all types make their way around weaving in and out od merchants that have set up their wares.
**"I don't know what we'll find in the way of a ship but we should look just in case they come up empty."** He was watching Deidra as he walked. She seemed out of place as he was having a problem trying to fit in and not walk like an Imperial officer. He was wondering when the questions were going to start coming. What he did at the booth even surprised him. It was only a matter of time till he was going to have to explain it. He just wished that Tar'ja would be there for the conversation also. He looked back in the direction that she and Kasga had went. Seeing no sign of them he turned back and continued walking among the merchants.
Just about anything and everything was available. Sad thing is that they needed a ship and maybe a load lifter depending on the cargo. He wished he would have asked how big the cargo was. Too late for that now.
When the troopers were spotted shaking down a person on the street Deidra motions for the two of them to step off to the side with her. Without warning Deidra's demeanor changed drastically and shockingly. ***Oh man.***
She had curled up to him in the same way he had seen many joy-girls do in the past. the pouting, fluttering eyes, change in voice tone surprised him. But they weren't as surprising as when she started gyrating her hips against his leg. The look of surprise was obvious but he recovered pretty quickly as he put his arm around her in an attempt to keep up the "act".
â€œOh do we have to leave so soon? *giggle* Câ€™mon just one more night puleeeze?â€ She said seductively. Chase just closed his eyes. ***She's not right*** He thought as she pulled his shirt and draws him in close. So close that he has no trouble noticing the curves that are all wrapped up in her small frame. With her head on his shoulder and his arm around her she heaved a moaning sigh. One that anyone near them would have heard.
He couldn't see her face for which he was glad. but he heard her speak softly. â€I suggest we look for a supplier that seems to have enough stock for transports, theyâ€™d know who we should talk to for transport off-world.â€ She giggled and squirmed again against his body.
Chase looked around. He felt like he was sticking out like a sore thumb with Deidra clinging to him. He looked at Dex and shrugged. He noticed the Toydarin across the street calling out his wares. looking over the scrap yard he thought he saw what appeared to be a ship under a pile of scrap metal.
He rubbed his hand on Deidra's back to keep up the act. **"Sure thing girl I can stay another night. But lets check out that merchant first before we get to our fun. I think there's a ship over there."**

Tar'ja frowns, about as annoyed by the lack of large ship where she had left it as he was. "Is it really wise to simply return to the others without even looking first or asking where it had gone?" Not that getting back to the others didn't sound like a great plan. She wanted to get this over with quickly if only to get back to Ch-to get back to the others.
*Oh you've gotten quite smitten haven't you..* She shakes her head, lekku shifting on her shoulders and down her back as she does. Crossing her arms she looks to the male with her, waiting for a decision.

Dexter stops in the street figuring out which way would be best when his friends come up behind him. "About time. If I can get access to a terminal I might be able to pull the info we need. And before you ask yes I could have easily lost you in this crowd. Put of my training." Dexter looks down at his data pad he searches thought information on where the ISB office might be and a map of any buildings the might be close to it.

**OOC:** Ganthet, Deidra and Chase have already moved down the street looking at merchants. I'll incoroprate what you said in my post.
**IC:**
Chase keep up with the act of a soldier on leave with his temporary joy-ride hanging on him. With is arm around Deidra and hers up around his shoulders she was able to tell that he was somewhat muscular, evidence of a life that involved physical labor, which the cloak tended to hide fairely well. He looked down at her and gave her a smile. Despite haveing an attractive, curvy, compact, acting somewhat feral woman hanging on him he still thought of Tar'ja. He hoped that she and Kasga were able to get the *Not to Shabby* at the farm. A thought came to him.
***You're in trouble Chase. A attractive woman is hanging all over you and you're thinking of another.*** He took a deep breath and gave a sigh. As he looked to Dexter who wanted to find a terminal.
He stepped closer to Dex as he held on to Deidra. **"I know were also looking for a terminal to use maybe the Toydarin might be able to head us in the right direction."**  He lowered his voice for just the three of them where thay stood off to the side of the passing crowds. **"I understand the need to look for info on what were looking for but if it was able to be found on this planets network wouldn't they…"** Chase shifted his eyes to some Imps down the road. **"…have found it also? The contact gave us a general area. Isn't that enough?"** He looked at the Bothan waiting for an reply.
Chase understood that Dexter had some skills. Slicing and computer skills he figured. The bothan spynet was known for its ability to find and locate things. The last thing he wanted to do was not let him do his thing but if his poking around got them noticed the mission could end quicker than they wanted to.

**Making like a tart in Mos Eisley: Merchant rowâ€¦ thatâ€™s not sounding as safe spelled out like thatâ€¦ argh!**
***Iâ€™d almost be more comfortable if Chase was injured. How do the joy-girls make this look so easy?*** Shifts slightly from the awkwardness of his arm around behind her and having to twist herself into his side.
Naryen looks around at their surroundings, as Dexter seems to explain that heâ€™s had formal training of some sort, while periodically nuzzling back into Chases chest with her right arm around his back and her left had occasionally playing up and down his stomach. ***Is there a public net access point around this place?*** ((OCC: Galactic Lore & Knowledge:Tech or anything else that appliesâ€¦)) She notices a physique hardened with physical labor, given the build.
As much as she is providing physical attention, in appearance, her focus is very much on her surroundings, not even looking up at Chase. ***Thatâ€™s right, just some harlot thatâ€™s so incapacitated she canâ€™t even look up at her latest source of funding.*** She feels Chase take a deep breath and sigh, so looks up to see whatâ€™s wrong and hears him speak in a low voice: "I know were also looking for a terminal to use maybe the Toydarin might be able to head us in the right direction.â€ Naryen looks to that booth as Chase seems to address Dexter.
She tenses slightly at what she notices, now, in the disordered pile ***Is that an actual ship in that pile of debris!?*** Naryen tugs on Chaseâ€™s shirt to indicate he lower his head so she can do something with the side of his head. When he lowers/turns his head Naryen takes his head and pulls it to her, while biting her lower lip until his head obscures her face, then whispers in his ear. **â€I think I see a ship in a that pile. It doesnâ€™t look like its being well taken care of so perhaps we can arrange something?â€** She pinches his chest lightly, **â€You donâ€™t seem interested enough.â€** then pulls back and looks intently at the ship, speaking openly but with an overly melodic pitch to her voice **â€Whatâ€™s that over there?â€** She pulls Chase's shirt in that direction.

With Deidra hanging off of him he was waiting or Dex to answer his question. While she was making it very obvious to others that she was his girl he noticed how she was watching taking in every detail. He was impressed. She was good at what she did. He doubted that little ever got by the former Imperial. ***Former Imp or not she's good at what she does.***
With a tug on his shirt she indicated for him to drop his head. Being more than half a foot taller than the woman he brings his head down with her help as she pulls it towards her face. At the last minute she moved her mouth around to his ear. â€I think I see a ship in a that pile. It doesnâ€™t look like its being well taken care of so perhaps we can arrange something?â€ He nodded slightly and smiled as if she was telling what elicit things she was going to do to him later. ***I just said that didn't you hear me.*** He thought as he felt her pinch her chest lightly. â€You donâ€™t seem interested enough.â€ She pulled back to look over at the yard her voice was overly girlish. â€Whatâ€™s that over there?â€ She pulled on his shirt in the direction of the Toydarin.
He eyed her slightly and looked at Dexter who was standing close. ***Not into it huh.*** As she walked in front of him pulling his shirt he took a big step to her right and let his left hand fall back. With a semi loud *whack* His hand smacked her on he backside. From the stinging in his hand he knew it must have stung and surprised her as it moved her quickly ahead a few inches. He grabbed her by the waist and pulled her close again. **"That Babe was the ship i mentioned. Didn't I promise you a way off this forsaken planet? Lets go see what he wants for it."**
Looking over his shoulder the answer to his question to Dex would have to wait. **"Lets go partner and see if we can get out of here."** Quickly they crossed the street and walked up to the Todyarin. **"Merchant. I promised my lady friend here…"** He smirked and chuckled a bit as he gave her another smack on the behind but not as hard this time. **"That I'd get her off this planet. Do you know where I can get a ship to get to get out of here?"**

Dexter looks up from his data pad. "Sorry I get alittle too focused sometimes on what I am doing." Dexter looks over at the junk dealer. "You might be right you guys keep him busy and I will make use of his terminal if he has one." Dex smiles he loves using things that he is not supposed to be using. "See if he has got any good computer stuff will you never know what you might need along the way."

Kasga starts to head toward the farm as Tar'ja suggests the obvious.
Pausing, he says, **Yeah, that's what I meant. Let's go see what Dodennaa knows"**
Kasga walks off slow toward the farm waiting for Tar'ja to match pace to speed up. His eyes wander about the place looking for any other unusual signs wary of the Empire appearing at any time.

**Making like a tart in Mos Eisley: Merchant row.**
Naryen shifted as Chase repositioned. Just as she began to wonder why a firm impact fell across her buttocks mid-step served as an answer. If not for her swaying balance, she hoped portraying herself as loose and easy, she would have gone careening forward into the dirt. Her expression blanked as memories of some of her experiences in the officers clubs and officers mess flashed through her mind and what she did in answer.
She stepped to maintain her balance as her hand slid towards her hip and she recalled the look on one particular officer in trainings face when she climbed into his bunk and gently placed the muzzle against what he cherished so much. A small smile drifted back as she recalled the change in expression as she undid the safety. The humiliation he caused her was well worth the reprimand for inflicting grievous injury to a fellow officer. When the investigation, later, showed what he had done to her it was deemed internal and resolved. Nice choice of words there
She started to shake her head clear as Chase stepped up to her and slid an arm around her waist. "That Babe was the ship i mentioned. Didn't I promise you a way off this forsaken planet? Lets go see what he wants for it." She blinked up at him for a moment then smiled and nuzzled back into his side. ***Wow that was risky.*** She placed her hand on her hip, where her pistol holster used to be kept.
Chase called over his shoulder to Dexter "Lets go partner and see if we can get out of here." Quickly they crossed the street and walked up to the Todyarin. "Merchant. I promised my lady friend here..." Chase smacked her backside again, more playfully. Naryen pulled him closer and half hid a smile and moaned into his shirt."That I'd get her off this planet. Do you know where I can get a ship to get to get out of here?"
From behind Chase she hears Dexter talk about trying to use their terminal. ***Ah so heâ€™s a slicer of one sort or another. Interesting.***

Dosennaa waves as you walk down the dune towards the small farm house. Children run and play behind the little Bimm woman a few of the kids even take a second to notice you, briefly slowing to wave. "Ah welcome back though I was not expecting you back so soon." Dosennaa smiles then gives a raised furry eyebrow. "Where are the others?"
Lyn`aris and Lahelas can be seen down in the common court yard seated with some of the other children in class as the farms protocol droid lectures. Deep in their study they do not notice your return to the farm.
Looking around the only sign of the ship Not Too Shabby are the landing imprints left in the desert sand. Dosennaa notices the two of you looking around searching. "What is it are you all ok?"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dexter runs through the limited information on his data pad. Limited only due to the nature of or lack of record keeping on this planet. Records only bring unwanted attention on Tatooine something even honest folk want to avoid here. After a few key searches Dexter is able to locate the ISB office in the center of the city, currently stationed within the cities communications array and small barracks.
As you approach the Toydarian merchant you notice he like so many others on this planet in this city is armed. Dexters takes note of a pair of retro fitted labour droids turned makeshift security droid laying in two piles of rubble. The Bothans keen eyes notice that they are active and most likely programed to play dead unless needed. Their positioning gives them an excellent view of most of the Toydarians merchandise and the merchant himself.
The merchant nods to your group while hovering in place grants your group a slight bow while maintaining eye contact. The Toydarian circles around your group sizing you all up then stopping in front of Chase in a hover. "Ah call me Fosso and a ship I have for you. Most importantly contacts I haves as well."
Dexter looks around the merchants layout some more but does not find a terminal, if he has one its hidden or in the small building off to the side of his lot. Fosso scratches his stubbly chin "What type of ship you be you looking for?"

Dexter is kind of disapointed at the fact that sneaking into the Imperial Hq was going to take longer then they had. But on a better note there might a terminal in an out building on the junk dealers properity. Dexter looks to see if the he is watching or paying attention to him. Then he starts to move slowly towards the out building making it look like he was just looking around at his wares. He also notices the two driods guarding the front of the out building. He walks around the building looking for any signs if there is anything in the buiding that might be of interest.
He slowly makes hi way back to his friends keeping mind to check out the building that was being gruaded. Looking at the juck dealer he bows out of repect. "Good day my friend. I couldn't help but over hear that you might be able to helps out with some information we need? We are looking for a ship to use and transport off planet if we need use of it? The galaxy is not a friendly place and i was hopeing that we might have a generus soul who might be able to help us out? Dexter trys to make himself friendly and willing to discuss an exchange for information. "We would be willing to pay you for your trouble of course."

The Toydarian merchant nods, circles around, then stops to hover in front of Chase. "Ah call me Fosso and a ship I have for you. Most importantly contacts I haves as well." ***Thatâ€™s right, focus on the male and ignore the female thatâ€™s apparently selling her body.*** While keeping her ears keyed on the conversation Naryen looks to see if Dexter picked up the reference to offered contacts, absently tracing the contours of Chases stomach with her fingers. If the Imperial reports were to be believed it should have caught his interest.
She flinches mentally and physically at the racial reference as she chastises herself. ***Wow Iâ€™ve been doing that a lot today! That is correct, all Twiâ€™Leks are prostitues and all Bothans are spies for someone else.*** Fosso scratches his stubbly chin "What type of you be you looking for?" Naryen grips Chases lower stomach and hisses **â€One with locks on the doors!â€** her apparent idle musings stop and her gaze focuses on the ship in the merchants pile. **â€What about that one?â€** She, hopefully, expresses a sense of particular urgency as she shivers slightly.

Chase watched the armed merchant size them up. The winged alien circled them as chase looked around the lot. The fact that it was armed wasn't lost on him. Deridra kept up the act much to his indifference. Outwardly he showed the typical responses to her behavior but she was right he wasn't into it but he wasn't going to blow it because of that. He ran his hand up and down Deidra's back as the Toydarian hovered in front on them. It finally bowed and Chase grinned. "Ah call me Fosso and a ship I have for you. Most importantly contacts I haves as well." Chase looked around the lot in the direction of the one they had spotted from across the street. "What type of ship you be you looking for?"
Before he could respond he felt Deidra's hand grip his stomach and he heard her altered voice. â€One with locks on the doors!â€ It was funny and Chase had a hard time to not start chuckling. Her musings stop short as she continued. â€What about that one?â€ She mentioned as she looked in the ships direction that was under the scrap pile. His gaze followed hers.
Chase smiled as he held Deidra close and rubbed her small of her back. ***I wonder if Imperial training involved acting like a prostitute. If it did she was probably at the top of her class.*** Looking back to the Toydarian he nodded. **"A transport with a decent cargo capacity, working hyperdrive and locks on the doors."** He added in last for the sake of his companion. He looked at the ship that was pointed out. **"I have promised her a life of trading and adventure and I aim to give her just that. Nothing is too good for my little pooka. Can we see that one."** Chase pointed out the one Deidra did.

Gesturing toward Tar'ja, he continues,**"She came in on one called Not Too Shabby. We were going to look it over, but it's not here. Do you know when it left and who was flying it?"**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

Tar'ja couldn't help looking over to her little Lyn studying away inside the court yard. Such a different life then that one she led, but then this is why she was doing what she was doing now. To make sure Lyn would have that better life; maybe she'd even get a respectable job...a soft smile reaches her eyes though doesn't touch her lips; maybe someday.
Attention returning to the conversation at had she waits for the response on the where-abouts of the ship.

Dosennaa smiles noting that nothing is wrong, she did seem a concerned that something bad might have happend. Behind her you notice the two Dewbacks and carts where your group left them. Its obvious that Dosennaa has no use for them, they look as though they had been recently prepared for departure.
"Bandous left not too long ago. He has attracted some unwanted attention and did not want to endanger the farm. He did say he was sorry and wanted to say good bye to Dexter before he left." Dosennaa motions to the empty spot where the Not Too Shabby was landed. "He would not say where he went only that it was in the best interests to those he calls friends."
Dexter had mentioned that events leading up to his meeting with your group where exciting to say the least. This just adds to the mystery of what exactly he was up to or involved in.
Dosennaa continues "I have your carts ready, we have no need of them here on the farm and to feed them would just add another drain we can not afford." Dosennaa smiles noticing Tar`ja focus "She will do fine and is already one of the top students, come back and visit her when ever you want to .... need to."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fosso turns to look at Dexter his wings fluttering to keep his hovering altitude. "Yes yes the galaxy is dangerous and a group like yourselves would need a fine ship indead." Again Dexter notices the modified labour droids maintaining a constant watch on the area. Near by shoppers continue about their daily routine and the storm trooper patrol passes by your group without so much as a second glance only to shake down yet another individual down the road.
Turning back to answer Chase Fosso pauses to look the flirty human up and down. With a smile Fosso eventually turns to look at Chase then looks back to the half buried ship at the back of his lot. "Ah that is used for parts and an office. I do have a ship in working order beyond in my personal hanger. I have been working on it personally and for the price you will find no better ship. Come come I take you."
The Toydarian lets out a whistle and a small Jawa exits the ship. The little Jawa squeals out "Ilana!"
Fosso answers "Watch the lot for me I have potential clients."
The little Jawa nods then moves to stand on the speeder hood. Yelling out to the crowd "Yukusu kenza keena. Etee uwanna waa!"
Satisfied that the Jawa is watching his operation Fosso motions for you all to follow "This way." The Toydarian leads you to the end of his lot behind a scrap pile to a single durasteel door. Inside Fosso turns on the lighting system illuminating a large single hanger bay. Only a few tools scattered here and there share the room with a worn Gysnor-2 Freighter.
Smiling Fosso bows as if presenting his most valuable commodity. "So lets talk business shall we."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-04-13 13:01:15)

Fosso answered Dexter question and then turned his attention back to him. Before he speaks thought he gives Deidra a once over. ***Yeah that's right she's just a joy-girl hanging onto the man of the day.*** A smile appeared and he looked back to chase and then the ship in question. "Ah that is used for parts and an office. I do have a ship in working order beyond in my personal hanger. I have been working on it personally and for the price you will find no better ship. Come come I take you."
With a whistle from Fosso a little Jawa exited the scraped ship. Instructions were given and they were motioned to follow. "This way." Chase followed behind the winged alien. It's wings hummed from their motion and sent up little swirls of dust as he passed things. they stood before a single durasteel door. Upon entering the hanger the lighting system came to life and relieved a single ship.
It looked old. ***Some of those are still kicking around? I wonder when it last flew?***
Fosso bowed and smiled big. It seemed to Chase that this was his most valued possession and judging from what he had seen so far it probably was. Which wasn't saying much.
"So lets talk business shall we."
Chase looked the ship over from where he was. **"I didn't think those were around anymore."** He smiled and looked at Deidra as he pulled he in a little tighter. **"Good news sweetie, these old ships had locks on the doors. We won't be disturbed at all."**
He looked over to Dex.**"What do you think?"** He waited for Dex's answer before he spoke again this time to Fosso. **"Can we take a look at it maybe check it over?"**

<strong>Making like an intelligent growth off some poor shmucks hip in Mos Eisley: Merchant row.</strong>
As the troopers move past Chase will fee some amount of tension from Naryens grip. Thanks to her background with Chase he easily perceives them correctly as something other than tremors of arousal. Fear and anxiety easily conveyed to Chase from being pressed so tightly to Chase.
"Yukusu kenza keena. Etee uwanna waa!" ***So much for having ready access to an Imperial Protocol droid.*** **Kewoot!** (((OCC: see: Girlish pronunciations for â€œcuteâ€.))) A look of distain will flash across her face which could be misinterpreted as disgust for Jawas. Itâ€™s directed at the sound of her own voice. ***I sound like a cooing skirt-beast. Ugh.***
She follows Chases hips to the hanger where she sees a few tools here and there and a worn Gysnor-2 Freighter. ***A museum piece.***
Merchant: "So letâ€™s talk business shall we." Chase: "I didn't think those were around anymore." Naryen felt Chase pull her to him and heard him say. "Good news sweetie, these old ships had locks on the doors. We won't be disturbed at all.â€ To this she buries her face in his chest and squeals (((OCC: so to hide her frustration at having to act like this, but it could be interpreted another wayâ€¦, Chase just got teeth marks. >:D )))
â€œCan we take a look at it maybe check it over?â€ Naryen turns to the merchant and saying **â€œCan I look at it while you two talk? Puleeez?â€** A seriously emphasized pouty face showing here with big blinking eyes pulling Chase to her here and staring up in his face. Her eyes, however, show a calculating expression for Chases eyes alone.

Chase ran his hand up to where Deidra had bit him. He took a deep breath as he rubbed the spot. ***Back off. This was your idea. If you're not comfortable acting this out then you should have thought of something else.*** He wanted to tell that to her but it was too late now for that. It would have to wait.
She pulled his face close and he looked into the cold blue eyes. ***With eyes like that I can see why she made good Imp material.*** â€œCan I look at it while you two talk? Puleeez?â€ He got the implied message that she wanted to look around at the ship. He nodded. **"I don't see why not."** He looked at Fooso. **"Would it be all right if she looked around?"** Chase kept his breathing even as he reached out with the Force. He wasn't sure if could do it but he wanted to get a sense of the merchant. He let go of Deidra and felt a wave of relief roll off of him. At that moment he thought of Tar'ja with her blue eyes, that were a stark contrast to Deidra's. He mentally shook his head to keep on topic.
**"Perhaps you can give us some details about the ship like cargo capacity, drives, any thing that might be note worthy. I need to make sure that this fine ship will be suitable for out needs."** He let go Deidra to let her do her looking around. He looked at Dex. **"Any questions for Fosso here?"**

Turning to Tar'ja, Kasga says, **"Well, let's get back to the others."** as he walks away from the farm.

"You also mentioned some contacts that you had. I would be every interesting talking with them if they are willing. Could you put us into contact with them?" Dexter keep the same friend air. He is just looking for the ship and the info on the contacts that the junk dealer has.

The twin suns beat down onto the desert floor creating a low haze of smoldering heat at the ground level. The day was starting out hot with an orange glow on the horizon.
Dosennaa waves her short furry Bimm arms farewell as the two of you walk off trying to decide your next best course of action. The woman is interrupted in mid wave when a few of the children bump into her.
The two Dewbacks grunt in protest against the heat. Though native to Tatooine most animals have little tolerance for the direct blaze of this worlds twin suns.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The rotund Toydarian eyes the human girl once more, smiling with its answer. "Oh sure take all the times you need to look her over. The beds are on the insides though." Chuckling Fosso nods to Chase "look her over my friend yes enjoy yourselves."
Fosso turns in mid air to face Dexter. Its wings beating rapidly Fosso lets out a snort. "No no yous be taking my business, you try to take the moisture farm from Fosso. I be your contact, whats you needs Fosso gets."
Chase takes a step towards the ship and closes his eyes for a moment. Reaching out with his feelings the human male shakes his head. Today the force is silent with its secrets.
Scanning over the hull you notice more then a few blast marks. As your group continues the inspection Fosso begins to point out key features. "Her hull is solid that I am sure of, engines are in good order as well." You notice the ship lacks a cannon.
Dexter moves inside and towards the cockpit. Powering up the ship the Bothan notes how well the computer functions. Dexter begins a systems check while the others explore the rest of the ship.
Fosso continues to mark the ships attributes. "She has a large hold eighty plus tons. She can take four passengers comfortably, more in a hurry if needed. You will notice the lack of call sign, I left it that way for potential buyers."
Inside the ships grey interior is clean and open. The few doors are unmarked and functional. At key intersections where ships components overlap the bulkheads its obvious that many of the parts have been scavenged from non-stock sources. Most of the service panels are left open showing recent signs of service
Finishing the systems check Dexter frowns at the read out.
-engines green
-life support green
-hull green
-computer core green
-hyperdrive N/A
-shields N/A
-weapons N/A
Fosso enters the cockpit and notices the readout of the systems check. "Oh of course I have reduced the price for the unfinished work. I can get most any part you would need for the ship, but it will cost more. " The Toydarian smiles "so lets talk a deal!"
Chases comm sparks to life and Kasga`s voice can be heard over it. "Our lead was gone when we got there. We're heading back your way. Where should we meet you?"

Chase watched Fosso. The Toydarian was eying Derdra with a smile on his face. "Oh sure take all the times you need to look her over. The beds are on the insides though." Chase chuckled along with the winged merchant. "Look her over my friend yes enjoy yourselves." ***Don't worry I don't plan on having that type of fun.*** He didn't show it though as he looked at Deidra who stood next to him.
He began to walk towards the ship as Fosso began to talk with Dexter. Halfway to the ship he stopped for a moment pretending to look over the hull he reached out with the Force. His effort was for naught as the Force provided no insight for him. Walking under the cockpit he was surprised to find that the hull was actually in decent shape. At least to his untrained eye. ***Doesn't look bad from the outside but I have a feeling it's what we find inside is what will concern us.***
Entering the ship Chase felt like he was stepping back into time. This series of transports were old back in the time of the Clone Wars. It was practically ancient now. Fosso's voice rang out behind him as he rattled off it's features. "She has a large hold eighty plus tons. She can take four passengers comfortably, more in a hurry if needed. You will notice the lack of call sign, I left it that way for potential buyers."
The ship began to power up and Fosso turned away from him and went forward. Chase continued walking and came across Deidra who came out of a room. He lowered his voice a bit. **"It doesn't look too bad. Oh one more thing."** He leaned in a bit more and spoke softly. **"Don't bit me again, that wasn't nice."** He gave her a sarcastic smirk.
His comlink beeped. Taking it off his belt he brought it up and lowered the volume for just him and Deidra. The voice was Kasga's "Our lead was gone when we got there. We're heading back your way. Where should we meet you?"
Chase shook his head at the news. **"That's ok. We have a lead here."** He motioned to Deidra to follow and walked farther back from the cockpit. He relayed where they were and that they would probably still be here negotiating. **"Just don't be surprised by what you see."** Another hidden meaning. He disconnected the transmission and looked at Deidra. As he did he thought of Tar'ja and the feelings that he was beginning to have for the beautiful Twi'lek. He spoke softly and sighed. **"This ought to be interesting. You coming?"**
Chase walked towards the cockpit not waiting for Deidra. He wanted to see what Dexter had found out from powering thing up. He entered the cockpit all smiles. **"The ship looks fine Fosso. Even the rooms and they do lock."** He said with a chuckle. He looked to Dex. **"How do the systems check out, sublight, hyperdrive?"**

Tar'ja continued to walk beside her companion for the trip, a hand moving to wipe her forehead "Now i remember why I like shadows..." she mumbles under her breath, glaring at the sky. Her ears perk at Chases voice, her stomach doing some odd sort of flutter that she pretended never happened, too many strange things going on and she needed her attention on walking else she trip and eat sand.
"Just don't be surprised by what you see." Chase said last, causing confusion to run over the twi'leks features "don't be surprised? wonder what they could have found that would be surprising...come on, lets hurry back." She picks up her pace, the notion of shadows, cover from the sun, and Chase spurned her on to get back to the city.

Kasga ambled along listening for Chase's response.
Chase came on over the com, **"That's ok. We have a lead here."** He then gave a location and directions.
Satisfied, Kasga replaced the comlink on his belt. Tar'ja picks up the pace a bit moving the two of the back into the city bypassing Imperial patrol corridors with subtle ease.

"Very well my friend. I would be happy to exchange inforamtion with you and I can maybe send bussiness your way. I have friends that are in the information bussiness and a good contact is always a good thing." Dexter pulls out his data pad. " So what price for the ship and how soon can you have it ready for us to use? We are pressed for time and we need to sucre a ship. My friends and I for coures would be willing to help if it would be needed. I could also forward your name to some other friends of mine and direct more bussiness your way possabliy." Dexter still keeping his friendly air hopes that the extar bussiness might lower the price on the ship and parts some.
Looking back at Chase as he walks up. "Well it is fine. No hyperdrive and weapons, and no shield generateor either. Everything else is fine. Not that I am an expert pilot." He looks down at his data pad. "I was just discussing with our friend here on the price and an estimate on the time it will take to do the work. So friend what are you thinking might be a good price?" Looking at Chase then the Junk dealer.

**Mos Eisley: Merchant Row: Fosso&#39;s hanger. Inside an antiquity.**
Naryen felt Fossoâ€™s attention on her. "Oh sure take all the times you need to look her over. The beds are on the insides though." Naryen shivered, with a giggle, as was now expected of her. "Look her over my friend yes enjoy yourselves." ***Such an improper being.*** Now a little more conscious of the kind of person who would behave as she has been she begins to act impatient. ***I want to get out of here.***
When Chase stops walking towards the ship, Naryen looks up at his face. As pressed close to him as she is, she notices subtle changes in his poise and certainly his expression. ***Thatâ€™s a little familiarâ€¦ back at the cafÃ©?…*** She dismisses the thought, intending to continue to play along with the scenario she started, when Chase then released her and seemed to relax. ***Ah he must be feeling the same as me; Iâ€™ll give him some space and look around.***
Naryen walks inside the ship, swaying her hips and humming to herself trying hard to look part sheâ€™s layed out for herself, when someone powers the boat up. Once sheâ€™s inside there is enough to see for her to get a feeling for its age and its unfamiliarity. ***Old reliable better be how this is referred to.*** Listening to the sales pitch, echoing through the corridors, Naryen felt even less at ease. ***I must have been spoiledâ€¦ Fattened for the slaughter.*** The thought causes her to jerk lightly and her demeanor changes. She sighs, sets herself, and continues the self tour eventually meeting Chase "It doesn't look too bad. Oh one more thing." He says then leans in slightly and speaks softer. "Don't bit me again, that wasn't nice." She immediately averts her eyes at that comment and opens her mouth to apologize when his comlink beeps.
She observes and notes with disappointment the other ship not being available. Chases closing stands out, "Just don't be surprised by what you see." ***Subtle. I wonder if sheâ€™ll understand the reference if she sees us acting this farce further.*** ending his transmit then to Naryen "This ought to be interesting. You coming?" and walks off towards the cockpit, not waiting for her. Naryen stands there, briefly wondering if that was a dismissal, then smiles and slinks after him. "How do the systems check out, sublight, hyperdrive?" She looks at the display in front Dexter and notes the status showing in bright colors. ***No shields?***
She uncomfortably notes the similarities in command style between Chase and some recruits from her now dead home. Being led around like this is so very much against everything about her and itâ€™s starting to show. Listening to Dexters exchange with Fasso then his report to Chase she curls up to Chaseâ€™s side, like before. Her bahaviour is the same as but somewhat distracted. Trying to appear somewhat less interested (not that hard to do currently) she still tries to maintain the role. Only seen and heard in her capacity. ***Iâ€™m going have to remember this so I donâ€™t pull a stunt like this again!*** She displays an interest in the others conversation but keeping quiet like a good joy-girl when the mark is talking business.

### **Yogi** (2009-04-17 16:08:56)

Chase listened as Dex gave the run down of what he had found out. He sighed at the mention of the missing systems. the corner of his mouth turned up in frustration. ***No hyperdrive. What the hell are we going to do with no hyperdrive?*** He began to wonder how long it would take to get it working and if it would be fast enough for the droid, SBC.
He felt Deidra's presence next to him and she fell into the rool of his joy-girl again. He wasn't sure but this time it felt as if she wasn't as enthused as when they first began the ruse. He remembered the averted eyes when he mention the bite and he wondered if she was regrettnig the course of action she took in the street. ***I'm almost dreading the conversation after this is over.***  He thought. To take some of the pressure of Deidra he placed his arm around her as before but this time not as low and he didn't hold her in as tight as before. He hoped that she would understand his intentions.
He looked back and forth from Dexter and Fosso reacquiring his focus. **"No hyperdrive. That's not good."** he looked at Fosso. **"We will need to be able to leave the system. Shields would also be nice."** Ganthet followed up with asking Fosso how long it would take. He waited for Fosso to answer. He just hoped the answer was what he wanted to hear.

Leaving the farm, the children, Dosennaa and the carts behind you make your way back to the city. Trying to get back inside the city unnoticed is made easier without the cumbersome carts. Overhead no less then four trios of Ties patrol the sky. Those with the two other patrols you saw on the way in hints that the empire is up to something.
The other thing you notice is the lack of any traffic in the skies other then imperial ships. In the desert you managed to evade a small trooper patrol with Tar`ja`s lead, and now inside more foot patrols roam the city.
Jumping down from the city wall into a side alley everything becomes erie something is out of place. Up ahead you can hear several bangs and voices. "This one is locked move along check the next one." You can hear the low rhythmic roar of marching, with the echo its hard to tell what direction they are going.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Toydarian smiles and rubs his chin while hovering. Fosso begins to pace back and forth mumbling calculations under his breath. As Dexter speaks Fosso smiles. " I can gets a hyper drive but it will take time and credits. For the ship a fair price would be 14,000 me`s thinks."
From outside the ship you hear a sudden knock on the on the hanger bay door. The knock repeats "Open the door in the name of the empire!" The voice is stern and to the point.
Fosso frowns "Always, its becoming harder to Fosso for an honest living." FOsso turns then stops. "They have been running random searches the last few days. No one knows why .... is there anything you`s need to be telling Fosso?"

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-04-21 12:26:05)

Chase watched as Fosso as the Toydarian smiled and rubbed his chin as Dexter spoke. He didn't like the look on the merchants face. Chase made sure to keep his demeanor the same as it had been. ***I wonder if he thinks he be able to take us for?*** He thought as he stood there with Deidra next to him. Neither one of them really into the act anymore. ***If the merchant asks I can always say there was a disagreement in the back. Believable and plausible it should work.***
"I can gets a hyper drive but it will take time and credits. For the ship a fair price would be 14,000 me`s thinks."
***Fourteen thousand. I wonder if SBC can come up with that amount?*** He was fairly certain the price would not be an issue.
**"Fosso does that price include the hyperdrive or not."**
His question went unanswered as they were interrupted by a loud knock on the hanger door. It was repeated again. "Open the door in the name of the empire!" His hand pulled Deidra in a bit tighter then loosened his hold on her so that if she had to move he would not restrict her movements.
Chase looked at the alien as it frowned "Always, its becoming harder to Fosso for an honest living." It started for the door but stopped and turned. "They have been running random searches the last few days. No one knows why .... is there anything you`s need to be telling Fosso?"
Chase shook his head at the question. ***I bet their looking for the same thing we are.*** 
**"We're just looking for a transport so we can make some credits. Be our own bosses. Seems like its getting harder to do with each passing day.**
When Fosso turned back around chase searched for his focus. Being close to Deidra he knew that she would sense the subtle change. Taking a breath he was calm and ready. If anything was to happen the Force should let him know, should. ***I wish I had had more time with Master Garet.*** But he remembered that Garet had said he would be most alert and ready when he was calm and centered. Either way, with only one exit, this hanger was a bad place for things to go down.
He waited for the door to open.

Tar'ja looks back to her companion with a frown, they were searching the entire city? Looking back to the alley she sighs, this wasn't going to be easy if they didn't know which direction it was going.
Still it was better to keep moving then to stay in one place. Motioning to him wordlessly the twi'lek moves to the shadows, keeping low and out of the light. She would look around each corner before running to the next set of shadows doing her best to lead them to the others while not being caught.
What exactly were they searching for though..

Dexter's ears perk up when he hears the price of the ship. *"Maybe that will be with the parts we need as well."* Then he is some what disappointed when he hears that there bussiness was going to be intueruped by the Empire. "Like My friend said we are in the market for a ship to do some cargo hauling, passager that sort of thing." Dexter looks around at the controls somemore. "As far as why they are here, it could be as simple as you said just a routine check. we have nothing to hide."
After Fosso leaves to see what the Stromtroopers want. Dexter looks over at Chase. "I should warn you that I was in the middle of a battle between the Empire and this local crimelord that I was scaming before I hooked up with you guys. As far as I know they didn't see me but there is no way to know for sure." Dexter looks back to the controls. "Of course I should be able to myself clear if i have to. Been doing it for awhile now." Dexter smiles at the statement it was true he had been one step ahead of the Empire nd the Crimelords for quite sometime now.
((OCC: Deception +4, Persuasion +4, Precption +9. The frist ones are to reasure the Fosso that we arw nothing but what we say we are. The preception check is to make sure he buys it. Will spend a force point if I have to to make it work. Mainly for the frist buy the way.))

<strong>In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.</strong>
"I can gets a hyper drive but it will take time and credits. For the ship a fair price would be 14,000 me`s thinks." ***Wow thatâ€™s better than I was expecting but no HDrive is no good.*** Naryen feels a lack of conviction in Chases movements. ***All-in or not at all, so be it.***
A sudden knock on the on the hanger bay door followed by a stern voice makes the skin on the back of her neck strain with goose bumps. "Open the door in the name of the empire!" Her body immediately ripples and tenses then Chase pulls at her, which at that moment does exactly nothing. She takes the hint and steps closer to him to notice his more slack posture and change in his breathing again. ***Interesting.*** She looks in the direction of the hanger door as her focus increases manifold. The tension she's feeling is manifested in a placid expression and eyes like shards of blue ice.
Fosso frowns "Always, its becoming harder to Fosso for an honest living." Fosso turns then stops. "They have been running random searches the last few days. No one knows why .... is there anything you`s need to be telling Fosso?"
Chase shakes his head. "We're just looking for a transport so we can make some credits. Be our own bosses. Seems like its getting harder to do with each passing day.â€
Dexter adds "Like My friend said we are in the market for a ship to do some cargo hauling, passager that sort of thing." Dexter looks around. "As far as why they are here, it could be as simple as you said just a routine check. we have nothing to hide."
After Fosso leaves, Dexter looks over at Chase and explains what he has to hide then presents what could be a reassuring smile to some people, but not to Naryen.
Pitching her voice for the 3 of them:**â€We donâ€™t have time for this nor, likely, for Fasso to arrange for an HDrive. Perhaps we should arrange passage with someone already going out-system?â€** This is all said without looking at either Dexter or Chase. Naryens focus is obvious to them both.
**"I don't want a confrontation with troopers right now."**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-04-21 23:55:47)

Chase listened to Dex as Fosso left them to go and deal with the troopers. They all have had their run ins with the Empire. For for and against. The position they were in was bad. Trapped so to speak if things went bad. If they were forced to fight their way out the whole Imperial garrison in Mos Eisley would be on notice. No mater how good they were the numbers simply overwhelming.
Deidra whom he had pulled close again spoke softly so only the two of them would hear. â€We donâ€™t have time for this nor, likely, for Fasso to arrange for an HDrive. Perhaps we should arrange passage with someone already going out-system?â€ She paused for a second. "I don't want a confrontation with troopers right now."
Chase showed a genuine smile. Despite the circumstances his limited Jedi training has suited him well. He was calm, well as calm as one could be anyways. **"Me either. Problem is they look into you or I very much Deidra and they will find out who we are. Something neither of us wants."** He kept his voice low but both heard him as he shifted gears to the ship. **"Thing is with the ship is that we don't know how long it would take him to get the HDrive. Maybe a little extra credits and he can get it done quickly. It's a long shot I know."**  He looked around at the old cockpit. **"As far as arranging passage with someone else we need to get to the crash site and out of here. Bringing in someone else leads to more problems."**
He got her attention and looked at her. **"I know neither one os us is into this act anymore but we're gong to have to keep it up especially for the troopers outside. The more they think we're no trouble the quicker they should leave us alone. That work for you?"**
He waited for her to answer and then looked to Dex. **"Nice work talking to Fosso just a little bit ago. If the Imps leave us alone maybe a few extra credits can quicken the work on this pile of junk."**
***It's worth a shot anyways.*** He thought
**"Hey if they are picking up on their patrols I wonder if Tar'ja and Kasga will have any problems getting back to us?"** Splitting up seemed a good idea. Now he wasn't so sure.

"It has been my experiance that most people responed to credits. It just depends on the amount and how you ask." Dex looks down at the controls . "And Thank you. My intructors always said I had a sliver tounge, It usally got me into more trouble then you think it would." Dex smiles remebering his days at the acadmey. " So what do you thnk they are looking for, I mean i think we cover are tracks fairky well. Non of use are wanted by the Empire as far as we know. And i don't think they should have to much trouble gettong back here as long as they are carefull."

### **Yogi** (2009-04-22 21:54:13)

"Non of use are wanted by the Empire as far as we know... " Chase smiled at the comment. What followed held truth. If they were careful they should not have any problems. As far as none of them being wanted by the empire, he looked at Deidra and then back to Dexter. Memories came back to him as he looked out the view port.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wanted by the Empire.
Four little words that meant so much. Even since he had met Master Garet he had been on the run from the Empire. Vader and his bounty hunters will always be looking for him. They found him and Garet on Moorja, a planet on the Corellian Trade Spine on the outer edge of the inner rim. He never wanted to go back there. They had been herded there. They knew it but couldn't avoid it. It was going to come down to a fight one way or another. Several skirmishes were had and each time they managed to get away but not off planet. It had been the first time Chase had been forced to take a life. Even though it was in defense for his own life it still affected him in a way he could not foresee. Even though he had only been training for a little over two years he could still fell the life force leave each that he had killed. It was unsettling.
They had split up at Garet's urging. Chase wasn't real keen on the idea but it had made sense. Maybe alone they could shake their pursuers. It worked for a bit as Chase had managed to throw off the bounty hunter that was following him. Maybe it was luck, maybe the will of the Force. He wasn't sure but for the moment he was on is own as he made his way to the rendezvous with Master Garet.
Chase had gotten a feeling from the Force. Looking back on it now he realized it was telling him of danger. Something was happening. Hurrying along he made his way to the meeting place. He made it to a vantage point only to see Garet facing down almost a dozen bounty hunters. Garet stood there defiant light saber in hand, unlit. The group was armed, detonators, repeating blaster rifles, sidearms. They weren't taking any chances. Chase was ready to help. A moment before he stood he felt his Masters presence. Garet was urging him to run and get away. He wasn't able to move.
He blinked. In that instant fury erupted below him. Two bounty hunters were down from a gesture Garet made. Both were blown backwards. Blaster fire was herd as well as the activation of a lightsaber that began to deflect the shots aimed at him. The detonators were thrown. One was caught and thrown back. The other, found its mark. The blast from the two thermal detonators threw both Garet and bounty hunter alike. He was stunned but had made it back to one knee. He was able to block several shots but the repeaters opened up and there was simply too much to parry. Garet fell to blaster fire.
Chase stood there hidden by the containers that lined the docking port. He felt Garet's presence again. "Run Chase. Find a way from here. Run!" Encompassed by his presence Chase did somethig he had never done before. He ran away from those that were looking for him. The familiar presence that was his master faded. He was alone.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chase shivered only a few seconds had passed. He could still see Fosso making his way to the door mechanism that would open the hanger doors. He looked back to Dex his voice still low and very serious. **"You may not be wanted by the Empire my friend but others may not be so lucky."**

Ahead the marching gets louder, closer. A large column of white armored storm troopers in full assault gear. Every step in unison every movement orchestrated they are one practiced unit. The few remaining locals on the street scurry out of the way only to meet with a trooper or two.
One trooper pauses to look down your alley. Turning his helm sideways slightly the trooper stares down the cramped side way then opens his com. "TK-571 check out the alley take TK-931 with you and report back."
Two troopers salute simultaneously "Sir yes sir!"
The two troopers begin to search the alley walking slowly with rifles in hand. "You see those new E-webs?"
The second slightly behind the first in a duo cover formation responds. "Yea can`t wait to get certified training on those."
The first stops and raises his weapon. "Hey did you hear that?" The second instinctively raises his weapon as well. Both are about ten meters from your shadow concealed position, and both are scanning the alley depths in your direction.
-----------------------------------------------------
Fosso flaps away you notice he leaves the ships ramp open. A short moment later you hear the large hanger bay door squeal open enough for Fosso to answer the door. "Hello can Fosso help you today?"
"You are ordered to stand aside, we will search the area. Only your cooperation will ensure your safety." You can hear the hanger door forced open further.
Then Fosso complains as he is obviously being pushed aside. "Hey not so rough."
"Be silent alien scum." A short to the point response that quites the Toydarian. For another moment you hear the troopers throwing items around as they search. "Are you alone alien?"
Unsure of how to answer Fosso`s voice is low at first."I have some potential buyers inside. They are only locals looking to make a living."
Steps on the ships ramp can be heard they quickly scale the ramp and begin searching the ships interior. With the ships limited design it takes only seconds for the troopers to notice your group.
Weapons raised the two troopers close the distance to your group. Deidra takes notice of the standard duo cover formation the troopers are using. "Halt identify yourselves!" Staring through their tinted helms the two troopers wait for your compliance.

Tar'ja stops dead in her tracks, motioning to the Duro to keep silent. What to do...she could fire from the shadows and hope that they can get both before alerting the others, but then they might come looking if the two don't return.
Alien's aren't exactly looked upon greatly and might even just shoot them before asking questions of why they were in the alley...then again she could try something...would it work though? Last time she tried to play a part it didn't go very well...then again would it be better this time if the part she played was something her kind were known to do in slavery?
She had to think, first try first, stay low and in the shadows. She signals with a hand for him to do the same, moving slowly closer to help him stay hidden.

Chase watched as the troopers entered the hanger somewhat forcefully. He watched as they pushed their way past Fosso. Their questions were answered and they moved towards the ship looking for the merchants potential buyers. The armored boots were soon heard on the ships deck plates. It didn't take long for the troopers to find them. Two Imps closed on them weapons raised. "Halt identify yourselves!" The lead one commanded.
Chase stood there with his arm around Deidra back into the role of the guy with his joy-girl. He pretended to look startled and afraid to see the weapons leveled at him. It wasn't much of an act as it was always startling to have the business end of a weapon pointed at you. He raised his left hand and took his right, which was low on Deidra's hip, off as well.
**"We don't want any trouble sir. We're just looking at this old ship, we were thinking of buying it. My name is Wedge, has the merchant done something wrong?"** Chase gave the name that he took on Moorja that he used to buy forged papers that allowed him to get off planet. the papers that he had weren't the best. They would stand up to some scrutiny but any deep searching and they would be known to be fake.

Kasga slides closer to the wall, crouching slowly. He did not expect to be able to bluff the stormtroopers. The Empire is too well connected to not have shown the fugatives pictures to all their searching squads. His only hope was for them to past them by. Staying quiet and still, Kasga opens his awareness for the beginning of the battle.

In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.
"Problem is they look into you or I very much Deidra and they will find out who we are. Something neither of us wants." A little nod. ***Well thatâ€™s interesting. What would the Empire want with you Chase?*** Naryen then recalls the odd, near meditative, behaviour. ***Oh.***
"I know neither one os us is into this act anymore but we're gong to have to keep it up especially for the troopers outside. The more they think we're no trouble the quicker they should leave us alone. That work for you?" Naryen nuzzles into Chase inappropriately, again, and smiles up at him a little more relaxed, just to be a pest.
"Hey if they are picking up on their patrols I wonder if Tar'ja and Kasga will have any problems getting back to us?" Naryens eyes widen at this. ***Troopers performing inspections and Tarâ€™ja and Kasga have no human with them. I should have thought of that! Theyâ€™re searching for people from the crash so they will be paying attention to anyone who is investigating means off-world.***
Naryen listens to the words and pace of the troopers. "I have some potential buyers inside. They are only locals looking to make a living." ***And thereâ€™s their search profile. Oh no!***
With confident steps echoing through the hanger and the ship Naryen witnesses something she never expected to feel: her reaction to that which she devoted her life to.
Fear.
Before this moment itâ€™s been rationalized and redirected, but no longer. With the sight and sound of the troopers Naryen turns her head into Chases chest and starts to shake with fully realized fear. Her hands grip, hard, and she pull him towards her as she begins to tremble and her form shrank into his. ***This is what the Empire does with the Galaxy. Fear and force used to undermine rights and freedoms.*** Her perspective provides a clarity that glares painfully in her mind and, with a suddenness that Iâ€™m sure will come to worry her later, the tremors of fear became tremors of rage and the force on Chases body doubles. Her breath begins to quicken and shallow. Rage directed within and without.
She felt Chases hands come away. "We don't want any trouble sir. We're just looking at this old ship, we were thinking of buying it. My name is Wedge, has the merchant done something wrong?" ***Wedge huh?*** She tried hard to regulate her breathing but only managed squeeze a whimper from her throat.

Dexter looks at the guards entering the hanger and after they talk to and harass Fosso. They move toward the ship. Hearing Chase talking to the troopers. Dex decides to stay where he was in the pilots seat of the ship. He produces he ID and waits for his turn to be ask a million questions by someone who would rather shot them then talk to them. Thinking to himself.*"Just another day in the life of the unfriendly galatic regime. Got to love fate sometimes."*

Your hearts sink as you see the extent of their search. They have only progressed a few meters but they are checking every crate, shadow and door. Quietly the pair of troopers continue rifles ready as they move to search the alley inch by inch.
As the realization sets in so does the fear that they will eventually reach your position. Not even the shadows will conceal you then. Your minds race as you watch the troopers give each other silent hands signals. These troopers are well trained not like the local barracks who have only basic trooper training.
-----------------------------------------------------
The lead trooper motions to the cock pit with his blaster " There is another in the cockpit. Hey you hands where I can see them. Move over here with your friends." Though you have not been together long the mention of the word friends lends you all comfort in this situation, at the very least you are not in this alone.
The second trooper stares blankly at Deidra. The lead trooper meets Chase face to helm as Chase makes his plea. The trooper stands motionless and responds abruptly cutting Chase off. "I didn`t ask for your life story just your ID`s!"
Still the second trooper focuses on Deidra and no one else. The cold stare gives you all a very uncomfortable feeling. With her head buried in Chases chest Deidra can still feel the troopers gaze burning into the back of her head.

**In Fosso's Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.**
FEAR.
He could sense it though his connection with the Force. What surprised him was who it was coming from, Deidra. The troopers were doing their job well this time. They were different than the others he had working the streets days ago, more militant and aggressive. ***It must be unsettling for her. To be treated like this. To have been the one giving the orders to do acts like this. Funny how things work.*** Still she wasn't that person anymore. To judge her wouldn't be right. she was trying to work against the Empire now. that had to account for something. He rubbed his hand on her hip in an effort to reassure her. As he did so he felt the fear turn. Turn into something dark, anger and rage. Her grip on him increases. Hopefully the troopers will just take it for blind fear due to their presence. Regardless he stood there next to her. Someone for her to draw strength from.
The lead trooper calls and motions for Dexter to come out from the cockpit. He raised his hands and began to talk to the trooper. **"We don't want any trouble sir. We're just looking at this old ship, we were thinking of buying it. My name is Wedge, has the merchant done something wrong…?"** The trooper advance to stand with his helmet a mere foot from Chase's. Thankfully to his Jedi studies he didn't flinch and was surprisingly still calm as he was cut off in mid sentence. "I didn't ask for your life story just your ID`s!"
Chase simply nodded. **"Of course, my apologies let me get it. It's on my person back left pocket."** Chase made the extra effort of moving the cloak back so the troopers saw that he had nothing there as he reached for his credentials and produces them handing them over. He noitced the other trooper intently staring at Deidra who was doing her best to play the scared joy-girl. ***This isn't going well.*** He thought.
--------
**OOC:** Tru I'm not sure if the following is possible but if you read the SW books at all we see Jedi do this all the time. I thought rp wise it would be interesting. If not let me know an I'll nuke this part from the post.
**IC:**
He knew his lightsaber was only an instant away and could be in his hand in a flash, but a memory came to mind quicker than his hand could move the slightest towards his Jedi weapon.
*"Remeber the saber is not the only tool to a Jedi. The Jedi`s most powerful weapon is his mind. With it he one can do almost anything and against the weaker willed avoid unnessisary bloodshed. Now Chase, meditate on what you have learned today ….. "*  Garet's voice echoed in his memory.
Chase remembered a teaching from Garet. Sending out emotions good or bad could have an effect on someone if they weren't strong willed. Either way he tried it a few times he wasn't good at it but it was worth a try. As the trooper took his ID he simply stood there focused as much as he could without being obvious about it. If they did notice he could try and play it off as being nervous. He sent feelings that there were other places that they had to be. That there was nothing here for them to be mindful of. They needed to continue their sweep. He drew upon the Force to make it more impelling.
As he focused on what he wanted to accomplish the strain of imposing his will on the two troopers was beginning to show. His hand fell again to Deidra's hip where he in a sense held on for strength. The situation was almost desperate. It was almost unperceptive but his hand began to shake against her hip. A shaking that one might take for fear. The feelings of leaving and moving on were not having any effect. Sweat began to form on his brow from his exertion.
He had to do something else. He searched and dug deep into his being to find that connection that linked him to the Force. His left hand that was still up moved slightly from left to right. The fingers moved slightly as the hand moved. Deidra heard him speak softly under his breath. **"We don't need to see their ID's. Everything checks out. Lets move on."** His hand that was on her hip actually gripped her somewhat hard due to the exertion. He wasn't even aware he was doing so till he finished his attempt to influence the troopers. He relaxed ever so slightly as he watched the two in front of him to see if his try at this had worked.
Another memory popped into his head. *"Do or do not, there is no try."* If only it were so easy.

So much for being hidden, they needed to move...or start a fight. *If we only had a human we'd be in a lot better condition.* She thinks in annoyance, what to do...what were they looking for? anyone or people from the crash? she'd had too many aliases..they couldn't figure out who she was right? then again how many twi'leks of her coloring were there that used to run with a human gang?
they were in trouble..a lot of trouble..well...*then again on the brighter side..* she draws her weapon as quietly as she could and takes aim, only to stop with another idea, turning her head, she looks around for anything that might be small enough to pick up but would still work for her plan.

Dexter rasise his hands and moves out of the cocpit making sure his ID was with him. He moves over to the others keeping an eye on the troopers andhis friends. "Hello my good sir Dexter is the name Sabacc is my game. I am sure this is some miss understanding,my friends and I or just in the market for a ship and this fine gentle men was nice enuff to show us what he had on hand." Dexter hands over his Id and stands with his hands rasied. "So what seems to be the trouble here? Looking for Sumglers or something interesting? Would hate to think they would wasted a man of your talents on something like as trival as harassing the locals or anything." Dexter has no love for Stromtroopers after that night so long ago.

**In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.**
Naryen could feel the troopersâ€™ presence as he stepped up to Chase, totally violating the personal space of a Galactic Citizen this trooper should be sworn to protect. She would have assumed, in the past, that this trooper was of the local stock and thusly had been allowed to become lax in his training and principles but the crispness of their movements suggests clearly otherwise. This caused her hackles, thankfully covered by her attire, to try to leap off her bones in anger now, thankfully, coming under control. ***Donâ€™t focus on them, focus on Chaseâ€¦ Wedge.***
With effort she calmed and brought focus to bear manifesting in the start of a breath, which is then when she noticed the change in Chase as he said "Of course, my apologies let me get it. It's on my person back left pocket." She found herself holding her breath as she wondered at his even tone and especially his posture, reminiscent of someone with divided attention. Naryen immediately started to feel self conscious ***Is he worried about me?***
She felt his hand fall her hip and once again her being pressed to him was provided insights that would never have been available to her otherwise. ***No. Not meâ€¦ the other trooper?*** Her eyes widened against his chest while still being turned away from the troopers, head down and hair falling across her face. ***The second is focused on me then, since the first is addressing â€¦ Wedge, and heâ€™s trying to protect me!***
His change in poise, breathing, tone and movements were simply unmistakable, being wrapped around him like another set of clothes allowed her to feel every movement of nearly every muscle and tendon. Naryen found herself holding that breath as he spoke, perceiving Chase/Wedge as welcome distraction from her turmoil. ***The cafÃ©, then earlier and now again.*** Now that hers were far more under control she felt small tremors from his hand as he held out his papers.
His calm voice, pitched slightly different, tickled at her ears so close to his chest. "We don't need to see their ID's. Everything checks out. Lets move on." His hand squeezed her much harder as he spoke this time then he relaxed. She took it as her cue.
Tilting her head up to Chaseâ€™s face, still with her back mostly to the troopers and her hair falling down to obscure the side of her face the second trooper would have seen. With her eyes closed, steeling herself, using the held breath, she played her part as best she could, letting the anger she felt add a waver to her voice and a final tremor to her body. With a little luck it should be indistinguishable from a fearful reaction. She opened her eyes and looking into his, revealing the hardness and conviction there, to show Chase her support. When she spoke she layered her voice with the conviction of the truth of her words as she pitches her voice so that the troopers can overhear but still kept low so that the sense of closeness with Chase is conveyed.
**â€Wedge, we arenâ€™t important to them. Why are they still here?â€**
Naryen notes Dexters attempt to be distracting and tilts her head back down and closes her eyes mouthing soundlessly her thoughts ***Please let that be the distraction needed for this to work. I can always treat his concussion later.*** Naryen is expecting the troopers to butt Dexters face for talking out of turn.
((OOC: So for whatever may apply hereâ€™s a chunk of my stat blockâ€¦ which is still labeled as incompleteâ€¦? Could yâ€™all look that over please? Is it ok? Deception: +8(cha), Gather Info: +8(cha), Perception: +9(wis), Persuasion: +8(cha) A Force point to reinforce the attempt is quite acceptable and perhaps take this as an standard action to demoralize Mr Intensitiy.

Huddled within the shadows you wait and watch the troopers search the alley. With the shadows embrace covering your movements Tar`ja reaches around the ground for a distraction, anything. Satisfied the woman grabs a small rock, then begins to formulate a plan for distraction.
The two troopers begin to poke their rifle barrels into a half empty dumpster. with their attention focused Tar`ja throws the rock down the alley. Behind you current position 2 meters down is another alley, ahead of you 6 meters are the troopers and another 4 meters past them is the open street.
The rock sails through the air, its course masked by the shadows. Knocking off a the far wall the rock falls to the ground. In a flash of movement from the troopers rifle fire opens on the fallen rocks position.
Blaster shots echo throughout the alley as the two troopers unload on the alley floor. The distraction will not last long and briefly you look into each others eyes with a similar question. Fight or flight?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Time stands still for a moment the lead trooper stares at Chase as the human tries to convince him of your groups legitimacy as the second trooper stares at Deidra. Deidra notices Chase wave his hand and whisper under his breath "We don`t need to see their ID`s. Everything checks out. Lets move on."
For a second the trooper pauses to consider the situation, as he ignores the Bothans words. Then unexpectedly the lead trooper states "We don`t need to see their ID`s. Everything checks out. Lets move on." The trooper simply turns and motions to the second trooper.
The two march out of the ship where you can still hear the other trooper searching the hanger. After a few minutes the troopers leave the hanger all together.
Fosso flaps his way back into the ship looking a little roughed up. The Toydarian readjusts him green vest and sarcastically says "Fosso`s sorry for that, it is one of the benefits of operating on the hind end of space."

### **Yogi** (2009-04-30 12:32:11)

Chase stood there watching for some sort of reaction form the trooper. Nothing happened. He felt Deidra's head move from off his chest where she seemed to be biding from the gaze of the second trooper. ***Could this trooper possibly recognize her.*** He looked down at her. He looked into her blue eyes. In them he saw a strength that didn't show through before. Softly she spoke to him keeping up the ruse.
â€Wedge, we arenâ€™t important to them. Why are they still here?â€
It was then that Dex spoke. Chase back up to the trooper and almost cringing. He half expected the trooper to send the Bothan to the deck the hard way.
Time stood still for Chase. The sense of his own will that he had exerted through the Force towards the trooper has caused sweat to bead on his forehead. When the trooper spoke he barely kept the surprise out of his eyes. "We don`t need to see their ID`s. Everything checks out. Lets move on." With the words repeated the trooper turned and motioned for the other to follow.
When they had turned out of sight Chase relaxed as he leaned back against the bulkhead of the cockpit with his arm still around Deidra. His left hand that still held his fake credentials slid them back into his pocket. The the hand went to his head and wiped away the sweat that had accumulated there. ***It worked. It actually worked.*** A smile came to his face. One that conveyed that he was happy with himself. Never had it worked out that way before. He really was becoming more in tune with the Force. A sense of accomplishment and confidence filled him. ***You may not be here anymore Master but I'm still learning.*** He looked out the cockpit window to see the other trooper still giving Fosso a hard time. Soon they would be gone.
He looked at Dex and then down to Deidra. **"Everyone ok? We were lucky. Any idea why that one trooper was so intent on you."** The last was directed at Deidra. It would only be a few moments till Fosso returned to them. So they would have to speak quickly. And if he could deflect any questions about what he just did all the better.
------
Chase was standing now the effects of using the Force were almost subsided. Using it the way he did was much different that when he used his lightsaber. It was something to ponder. He was still close to Deidra. The act was still ongoing.
Fosso flew back into the ship. He had been roughed up a bit but he looked alright as he straightened his clothing. "Fosso`s sorry for that, it is one of the benefits of operating on the hind end of space."
Smiling Chase nodded. If only Fosso knew how close he was to being in some real trouble. **"We like the ship but the lack of a hyperdrive is a deal closer for us…"** He looked at the merchant for a second letting what he had said sink in a bit. **"But if it could be made hyperdrive capable we'd take it. Given what we just went through here the quicker the better. It might be possible to pay more for quicker service."** Chase hoped that the merchant would understand wanting to be away from here with the increasing Imperial presence causing strife for the local populace.

Tar'ja grabs the Duros' arm, moving as quick as she could while pulling someone and staying in the shadows. Her eyes are trained to the troopers as she moves them away from them and, stars help them, to another alley that would get them to the others.
Her Lekku twitch as familiar nerves and adrenaline rush into her system, it hadn't been long since the last time she had gotten into a tough spot, but it still gave her quite a rush. She's careful to make sure they don't touch anything or trip, well...she's careful on her part but with pulling the Duro along she wasn't sure he would keep his footing.
*If that wasn't clear I'm dragging him after him, along the wall, and away from the troopers.*

**In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.**
The pregnant pause that follows Chaseâ€™s words stretches to a point where Naryen is convinced it failed. She slowly reached, from Chases back, to her hip pouch where her pistol is stowed. Just as her fingertips brush the clasp she hears the trooper echo his words and pace. "We donâ€™t need to see their ID`s. Everything checks out. Lets move on." Itâ€™s everything she could do not to gasp out in relief, or simply gape, and instead releases the breath steady between pursed lips. Her eyes were wide with amazement that something like that could actually happen. The training she was provided with at the Imperial Academy only touched on some behaviors to look for but this is totally off the grid.
The two troopers turn and march out of the ship with all the precision and determination of before.
Before the troopers were off the gang-plank Chase leans back against the bulkhead, still holding onto Naryen, clearing taxed from the ordeal. He returned the papers to his person then wiped away sweat from his brow. A tired yet self satisfied smile came to his fatigued features. He looked out the cockpit window to watch the troopers further harass Fosso. Naryen, however, was watching Chase intently.
As her body and mind begin to steady themselves a thought jumps to the front of her mind. Recalling the cafÃ©, her eyes narrow as it comes into focus. ***He could have done that to me.*** She steadies herself further, with effort. ***Focus! There will be time for that later. Heâ€™s seems to have been upfront about his motivations. Doubting them now could undermine everything.*** She quickly looks Chase over, taking his pulse and testing various reactions to stimulus (eye focus, breathing, etc.). ((OOC: Assess condition using Treat Injury.))
Chase glances at Dexter and then Naryen. "Everyone ok? We were lucky. Any idea why that one trooper was so intent on you." Naryen noticed clearly that last part was directed at her. She smiled and nodded once then mouthed ***Later.*** as she helped Chase back to vertical watching him regain his composure. Still holding her close Naryen understood he was ready to get back to the roles they had adopted.
A slightly ruffled Fosso flaps back into the ship, adjusts his green vest and sarcastically says "Fosso`s sorry for that, it is one of the benefits of operating on the hind end of space."
Chase spoke "We like the ship but the lack of a hyperdrive is a deal closer for us..." paused, then "But if it could be made hyperdrive capable we'd take it. Given what we just went through here the quicker the better. It might be possible to pay more for quicker service."
Naryen looks past Fosso to the hanger, pouting, and in the best girlish tone. **â€I donâ€™t like those troopers.â€** She pulls herself closer to Chase and looks up at his face. **â€I *really* want to leave.â€** The emphasis is expressed via an moaning tone through gritted teeth and a certain gyration against Chase.

**Running down an alleyway in Mos Eisley**
Kasga saw Tar'ja look toward the rock and realized her plan. Kasga was already moving by the time she grabbed his arm. Once they round the corner, Kasga moves toward the center of the alley to avoid crunching sand under foot and revealing their presence. Additionally, he flicks his thumb slowly over the off switch to his comlink turning it off quietly. As they roll down the side alley, Kasga looks around for a door to hide in. Those troopers were not breaking down locks. If they could get inside and lock the door, they might could wait out the patrol.

Quickly you rush into the side alley, shadows play across its length. Garbage lay scattered throughout the 15m long stretch between the desert cities buildings. A few doors randomly line the buildings, at 10m and 15 meters the alley splits off into more side ways both in the direction of the open street.
Behind you the troopers end their assault on the alleyway floor with a few more shots. "Hey someone just ran off!"
You hear the distinctive click of a com activating as the second trooper speaks "lead this is TK-571 in pursuit of unknown suspect, over." You can hear the troopers coming closer.
Kasga frantically tries the closest of the doors smiling as the first door opens freely. Inside is an empty corridor with stairs leading up and down. You can see on the floor above and bellow hallways with doors on both sides. The door behind you does not lock and the layout of the building suggests a communal residence.
Scratched into the tan stone walls are the names Grumbo`s and Jabba. Both have been written over and over and many times over each other. The odd carbon score blast mark can be seen on a wall or the floor. Still not far behind you the troopers close in on this alley.

Fosso snorts at Chase then dexter. "Fosso has no hyper drive as of yet. I can get one yes." Fosso eyes the Bothan at the offer to continues negotiations alone then looks back to the pair of hormone driven humans. "So it is you to deal the credits? Fosso can be working with you. Though a hyper drive will take some time to get, not that you will be needing one any time soon the empire has made sure of that Fosso says."
Fosso motions for Dexter to follow "Come Fosso show you the ship and leave them`s alone." Finally finished readjusting his green vest after his encounter the Toydarian flaps towards the cargo hold. "This ship has some character Fosso knows this but she has it where it counts." The Toydarian continues down the corridor pausing only to look back towards dexter to make sure he is following.

**Fosso's shop: In the cockpit with Deidra.**
Chase stayed observant there in the cockpit. This deal was important. They needed this ship. Fosso spoke. "Fosso has no hyper drive as of yet. I can get one yes." Dex spoke up about continuing the negotiations alone. Chase nodded as he gave Deidra a little squeeze as if to emphasize the point. The little winged merchant continued. "So it is you to deal the credits? Fosso can be working with you. Though a hyper drive will take some time to get, not that you will be needing one any time soon the empire has made sure of that Fosso says." Fosso turned and motioned for Dexter to follow. Chase could hear his talk about the ship as he hovered towards the cargo hold.
When the two of them were out of sight and hearing range Chase relaxed his hold on Deidra. He looked down at the shorter former Imperial Agent. The look in her eyes said that she had questions. Questions she would want answered. He sensed several emotions coming off her. Uncertainty, suspicion and maybe a certain level of distrust but he wasn't sure of the last one. ***I might as well get to it. After what I just managed to pull off there's really no point in hiding it anymore.*** He returned her look with his own. One that conveyed that he knew he had been found out.
He lead Deidra farther into the cockpit. He let go of her and faced the woman in front of him. He kept his voice low so that it would not carry past the confines of the small area. He gave her a small smile. Not like the one he had given Tar'ja earlier but one of friendship none the less. **"I imagine that you have a question or two for me. Twice now I've done something that I'm sure have raised your suspicions. That much I can feel."**
He had opened the door. One that could not be shut. Someone would know who he really was and why he was on the run form the Empire. He waited for her question. He was sure that there would be more then one.

Fosso snorts at Chase then Dexter. "Fosso has no hyper drive as of yet. I can get one yes." Fosso eyes the Bothan then looks back to the pair of hormone driven humans. "So it is you to deal the credits? Fosso can be working with you. Though a hyper drive will take some time to get, not that you will be needing one any time soon the empire has made sure of that Fosso says." Naryen tenses against Chase and turns fully to his chest when Fosso says this. Her eyes harden noticeably then she looks up into Chases face with a concerned expression and mouths the word ***â€What?â€*** then thinking to herself ***Has the Empire made HDrives illegal equipment or is he talking about a blockade?***
Fosso motions for Dexter to follow "Come Fosso show you the ship and leave them`s alone." The Toydarian flaps towards the cargo hold, checking to see that Dexter is following, "This ship has some character Fosso knows this but she has it where it counts." Once they had gone some distance Naryen felt Chase relax and look down at her. She looked up in response and used a slight frown to show her question. ***Heâ€™s up to something, letâ€™s see where this goes.***
She let him lead her farther into the command pod then released and turned to face her. He gave a reassuring but somewhat tired smile, which seemed genuine enough, then spoke in a lowered voice "I imagine that you have a question or two for me. Twice now I've done something that I'm sure have raised your suspicions. That much I can feel." ***Twice?***
Naryen considers him for a moment then with a sigh she slants her head to one side and pitches her voice for close converse. In spite of the tone and approach Chase is using, blocking in a former Imperial Officer in close quarters like this, she finds herself smiling. Perhaps welcoming the respite of the roles theyâ€™d adopted to get past the troopers on the street. ***It seems that youâ€™ve gotten some way of detecting and affecting the presence and intent of others.* â€œYour intent seem genuine but Iâ€™m a little concerned with yourâ€¦ manners with those you seem to consider allies.â€** She paused briefly to let that set in, without the smile now. Her posture is a relaxed version of what sheâ€™s been accustomed but may come across rather severe to those not familiar with military protocol.
**â€ And by my count thatâ€™s three times.â€** She holds up her left hand and raises a finger for each as she goes. Index finger and her tone is rather cold and harsh. **â€Once in the CafÃ©,â€** middle finger and much softer and actually approvingly **â€again when we were approaching this shipâ€** thinking ***Iâ€™m assuming to detect an ambush*** ring finger and rather impressed **â€œand once more when the troopers, the intent and result there was rather obvious and would be to anyone watching the recording if their gear was outfitted with Active Duty Recorders.â€** She looks, worriedly, at her hand with that last one ***I hope not!*** then shakes her head and looks at Chase. **â€Nevermind that for all we know this ship is tied into a security net and weâ€™re being recorded, right now my concern is the episode in the CafÃ©. There are things in here that could get you killed.â€** Eye contact and a deadly serious tone contrast somewhat to the action of pointing at her head. Somewhat.
Pausing very briefly again, she lowers her hand and sighs again with a head hung for a moment, her hair falling across her face. She looked up but this time to the side, like looking away to somewhere distant **â€And now, having witnessed it so very closely, I know things that may result in your death should the wrong people find out. Iâ€™ll have to trust your judgment and discretion and you mineâ€** ***And here we go.*** assuming a lot, based on what she's witnessed and her seminars in the Academy, she takes a breath and runs her fingers through her hair to move it back from her face and looks Chase in the eyes.
**â€Especially if someone can witness your talents without being as close to you as I have been.â€** She looks back to him with a calm almost blank expression, colored slightly with a hopeful look. ***Assuming there are others like you out there and likely more skilled and not interested in competion.*** **â€I could use an ally I can trust, at least so far.â€** Recalling Thomas Lars for a moment her eyes soften considerably and her eyes drop for a moment. She takes a quick breath to steady her mind and looks back at Chase with a more resolved expression. ***Please let me be right about someone and something for a change!***

Tar'ja grabs the opening to the door to pull herself in, else she go skidding past it a few inches and that would just waste precious time. Getting in she looks quickly around, the words on the wall catch her attention for a minute before looking to the stairs, up they can go to the rooftops but there's like to be no shadows to hide in there and the air search will find them, down and they could be trapped.
"Down it is." she grabs the Duro's arm and takes the stairs two at a time, skipping the last three to simply jump down them and continue to run, looking around for anywhere they could hide or use for cover.
"Any ideas? I'm running low on some."

<strong>In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.</strong>
Chase watched Derida looking for any signs of trouble. Her former Imperial training may just take over. She let go of a semi big sigh and tilted her head to the side and then smiles. ***Is this good or bad?*** He thought quickly as she spoke.
â€œYour intent seem genuine but Iâ€™m a little concerned with yourâ€¦ manners with those you seem to consider allies.â€ He raised an eyebrow at that. ***What does she mean by that? That I hid my ability from people that I barely know. Try living in my shoes for a bit Deidra. It's not what you might think.***  She relaxed slightly but her form still held some of that Imperial rigidness that was common in its officers.
â€And by my count thatâ€™s three times.â€ He smiled at that. ***Perceptive this one is. Not that hard thought when she been draped all over me.*** He leaned against the chair that was behind him as he had a feeling that this might take a bit.
She went through the three times when she had detected him using the Force. The Cafe, in the hanger and just recently the incident with the two troopers. She made a good point with the active recorders on the troopers armor. â€Nevermind that for all we know this ship is tied into a security net and weâ€™re being recorded, right now my concern is the episode in the CafÃ©. There are things in here that could get you killed.â€ She said with a serious tone with her hand pointed at her head. ***I didn't mean to pry Deidra but the emotions radiating off of you and Tar'ja were overpowering.*** What had happened back in the cafe mush have freaked her out good. Then again if I was on the other end I probably would be also.
She paused briefly and this time she looked off to the side a distant look in her eyes. â€And now, having witnessed it so very closely, I know things that may result in your death should the wrong people find out. Iâ€™ll have to trust your judgment and discretion and you mine.â€ Running her hand through her hair she looked up into his eyes talking about others that would recognize my talents with out being as close as she was to me. He nodded as she spoke for she was right. He did take a big risk in doing what he just did. Finally with as much hope he had ever heard in her voice she finished. â€I could use an ally I can trust, at least so far.â€ Her head fell for a second then raised with a look of resolve she looked him in the eyes.
He nodded and smiled his voice was low but still friendly. **"Three times. I was hoping that I was getting better. Though the last one required a bit more effort. The Cafe I had no control over. The emotions coming off you and Tar'ja…"**  He stopped for a second when mentioning the beautiful Twi'lwk. He hoped that she and Kasga were ok. **"…were so strong anyone who is attuned like I am would have felt it. For some reason I had a glimpse, saw events that happened on your home planet. Of what happened not just to you but Tar'ja also."** He let that sink in for a second before continuing. **"I can't read your mind. I can perceive a persons emotions, intent but not read your thoughts. Even with what training I have had I've been known to get it wrong. Here in the hanger yes I did it again. I can tell if beings are about. Sometimes it good to know if someone is waiting around the corner for you with the intent for malice."** He gave her a smile.
He ran his hand through his short hair. **"And just a moment ago. Let me tell you that was the first time I was able to get that to work. If it hadn't we'd be in a big mess right now. Luckily for us the weak minded can be affected more than others. That is the closest I've come to a fight with troopers in a while. I've been on the run for almost three years now. Trying not to get noticed by anyone. The last thing I need is an Imperial Inquisitor or worse yet Vader looking for me."** The last sentence was said with a cold seriousness.
**"You talk about allies. I need them also. I finally decided to stop running and use my abilities to fight the Empire. The Force lead me here to you four just like it lead the four of you to where we met."** He didn't mention the farm just in case. **"You speak of trust. I trust you as I hope you trust me. I have an ability that must scream out to you that I must be evil. It's what you have been taught, taught a one sided story for the victor writes the history books. I am not evil. I just want to live my life with out the fear of being hunted down for what I am."** He swallowed hard and ran his hand through his hair again as he tried to regain his focus. He wanted allies and friends. He thought of Tar'ja and what might be. All he wanted was a chance to be free of the Empire. And for some reason being with these four was his way to achieve that.

Dexter listens to Fosso talk about the ship and it's history. "My friends quoted you I belive it was 14,000 for the ship. I am sure we could go higher if you could secure us a hyperdrive for it. I would like to make this deal profittable for both partys." Dexter continues his charming dameaner all the while talking to Fosso about the ship. "And of coures I would be able to give you access to some associetys of mine that could use more contacts and safe places to do bussiness. This could be even more profitable for you in the long run." Of course Dexter would pass Fosso name and location along to his suppiors and they would decide how best to use Fosso and any iformation he had. "What would be a fair price to you my friend, for the ship and the hyperdrive?" Dex trys to figure out what Fosso thinks of what he has offered so far.

Kasga shrugs off Tar'ja's grasp, then reaches down and scoops a double handful of sand. He flings it down the alley toward the closest corner trying to make it look like the sand was recently disturbed. He drags his foot across the area he scooped sand from and slid into the building closing the door quickly and quietly. He hopes the troopers will think they ran on past.
Worried about making noise going down the stairs, Kasga just steps back in the stairwell, drawing his Travotti Service pistol. He waits to see if his ruse works

**In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.**
Naryen took in Chases acknowledging nods and other indicators as she spoke. ***Looks good so far, he seems open and forthcoming.*** Naryen wondered why she was noting his posture so intently as he leaned against the swivel bridge seat behind him.
A smile showed on his face and in his voice, still pitched low. "Three times. I was hoping that I was getting better, though the last one required a bit more effort.â€ Naryen found herself sharing the smile in spite of her trepidation over his displays and her training, which is starting to tire her. ***Am I starting to trust this man?*** The word â€œtrustâ€ still rang hollow but perhaps a little less. â€œThe Cafe I had no control over. The emotions coming off you and Tar'ja..." His reaction as he said her name stood out. Desire? Worry? Yes to both it looked like and Naryen realized she was a little worried herself. Knowing the capabilities of people under her command was one thing but she really didnâ€™t know those two and she started to realize it. He paused then continued "...were so strong anyone who is attuned like I am would have felt it.â€
Naryens smile vanished. ***â€attunedâ€? Wait! What are you doing? This ship hasnâ€™t been swept!*** â€œFor some reason I had a glimpseâ€¦â€ ***No!*** The meaning behind the word â€œglimpseâ€ dove through her senses as his earlier reaction played back in her memory. His recounting with such confidence, as if he was there, which he wasnâ€™t. She had to act, now or they would be compromised. Her training has served her well in the past and the coiled spring posture and behaviors, once again, snaps her to action.
Crossing the short distance between them in a single step she focused her entire body-weight and directs it into Chaseâ€™s center of mass. With both hands open, and the focused momentum, she shoves him into the chair behind him. The chair turns to one side letting him fall, having been taken almost completely off his feet, and he goes to the deck to the left of him.
As soon as his center of mass moves off her hands her left goes up to his throat and her right to her hip pouch where she has her pistol. With a hop, off her step, she brings her legs to either side of his chest and follows him to the floor. Her eyes are focused, cold, and distant and if not for the intensity one might have said empty. Looking into his eyes just as her hand touches her pistol; the confrontation with the troopers plays back. The crispness of their movements, their forceful tones as they resisted the trained urge to shoot the nonhumans that resisted their authority. The imagined expression on their faces looking like the reflection she sees in Chaseâ€™s eyes.
Naryens eyes widen and begin to wet with tears. Her expression twists with pain, frustration, fear. Both her hands come up to either side of Chase head, balled into fists and rest, white-knuckled, on the deck She tilts her head down on his collarbone lays closer to him. Feeling the vibrations coming from Chases chest, Naryen realizes that her heart is pounding against her ribcage and his and had been pounding since the troopers had walked in.
She sits up, looking down at him and actually blushes lightly across her pale complexion for a moment as she wipes the tears off her face. Wiping the tears off with a look of naked embarrassment and a whisper of **â€œSorryâ€** she finds she suddenly canâ€™t look at the man she is currently straddling on the floor of some random tramp freighter and looks away, more self conscious of her display of emotions and perceived weakness than the fact that they may as well not have worn clothes for the last 10 minutes or so.
**â€œThat episode with the troopers really bothered me.â€** an admission to herself as much to him, her face twists as she suppresses tears, again. A quick glance back to his face showing an apologetic look and, finding she still canâ€™t look at him, she looks away again.

### **Yogi** (2009-05-06 22:33:22)

**â€œFor some reason I had a glimpseâ€¦â€** Chase never noticed that her smile vanished. In the instant that it took him to blink Deidra had collided with him. If he had been standing it probably wouldn't have knocked him off balance. As it was he was already leaning back against the chair which turned to the side. He left his feet and was beginning to descend into what would be an unwelcome contact with the floor. The hand on his throat was unmistakable. **"Karking hell!"** He managed to growl out through clenched teeth. He kept his teeth together so that he didn't bight off his tongue when his body impacted with the hard deck plate. Luckily for both of them due to his angle he didn't see her reach for what might be a weapon or this incident might have played out differently. ***What the hell is she doing? Why is she doing this.*** He thought as he could feel the pent up emotions that had been released from the pint sized woman. His initial surprise was now turning into fight or flight.
She followed him down quickly to the floor both legs are on either side of his chest just above his diaphragm. He looked up into her eyes as she straddled him. They were cold, focused He wasn't sure what he was reading in them. Something was going on, an inner struggle?. Something had finally snapped in the woman and she looked as if she was ready to kill him right here and now. Several defenses went through his mind quickly on how to recover from this position of relative weakness.
Since his arms weren't pinned his fists balled up he was about ready to strike her when he looked in her eyes again. They were wide and wet with tears. The almost feral expression she wore a fraction of a second ago was changing. He didn't so much see the emotion but felt it. It wasn't hard. They were as strong as they were in the cafe. The hand on his throat slid off to the right. The right hand was now to the left side of his head. He looked at her almost not believing what he was seeing and feeling. He had lost his focus and now he wasn't sure what Deidra was feeling. What the Force couldn't tell him his eyes could. Her head tilted and rested on his collarbone. Her body also fell and pressed up against him. Almost like before with their act but this time it was different. This time she was vulnerable. Perhaps the first time in a long time that she had ever let herself be this vulnerable in the presence of someone. He took a deep breath to calm himself as he unclenched his hands and brought them up to her back. He gave her a hug and held her there for a moment. ***What has she been through. I've seen some of it but there must be more to it all.*** He still want sure what and more importantly why this just happened but at least with his hands already on her he could better defend himself.
**"Shhh, It's ok. It's ok. Relax."** His right hand rubbed her back gently. When he felt he begin to rise he let go allowing her to sit up and wipe her eyes. Her pale complexion was enhanced buy he redness in her cheeks. "Sorry" she whispered. He simply nodded a he let his arms fall back and bend at the elbows. She looked away embarrassed. â€œThat episode with the troopers really bothered me.â€
He wasn't sure if it was the truth or part of the truth. The troopers bothered her that was true but it wasn't till he began talking about what had happened and what he had glimpsed from her. A realization came to him as he watched her attempt to suppress more tears. Looking at him again she quickly looked away. **"It's ok. Look at me.** He said a little more forceful. **"It's ok."** He let his hands fall to her thighs that were on either side and patted them. **"It might be easier to talk if you weren't sitting on my chest."** He gave a slight chuckle that made her move slightly as she sat there.
Another look of embarrassment crossed her face as she stood. She took a step forward and began to offer him her hand. It was then she realized what she was doing and stopped and retreated a half step. Lying on the floor next to her he saw her fighting with herself. He wondered if she would offer the help. From what he knew of her helping others like this probably wasn't high up on the scale. Finally a few seconds later she stepped forward again and shyly offered Chase a hand up.
Once on his feet he held on to her hand and drew Deidra in close and put his arms around her to give her some sort of comfort. He let his head fall till it was close to her ear and spoke softly do that only she could hear. **"Deidra I'm not your enemy. I don't know what you have been taught about people like me. Whatever it was it has been a one sided story. As the victors of wars write the history books. Omitting or changing the events so that they, the victors, don't seem so bad."**
He pulled his head back and separated a bit from her his hands on her hips. The position reminded him of the moment in the closet with Tar'ja. The closeness and feeling of a connection he felt with the Tei'lek. He hoped she was ok.
He focused again on Deidra and looked into her blue eyes his voice still low so only she could hear. **"I am not your enemy and neither are the others. You are going to have to trust us. If not them then at least me. But for now maybe we should wait to talk about what I've done till later. Good idea?"** He nodded his head a bit and smiled.
Edit: edited for grammer
Edit again: Tru after talking with Reb we thought it would be worth while to show her initial reluctance to help chase to his feet. Former military training, showing weakness and all that. Hope that's ok.

**In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.**
Naryen had wanted to throw him in an apparent fit of playful passion, have to maintain appearances and all that. Being so close to Chase as he fell, as the emotional effect of the encounter with the troopers and memory of what he had done in the CafÃ© played through her mind, changed that. For the briefest fraction of time all she saw was an enemy she had an advantage over and one massive dose of adrenaline riding a wave of betrayal and misery. She barely felt his rubbing her back or his reassurances that accompanied the attention.
***Oh how the mighty have fallen.*** Alone with someone able to violate her mind seemingly at will, and having shown him now so much of herself freely, she hadnâ€™t felt this self conscious since the Academy. ***Why worry about his ability to read your mind? Youâ€™ll give him everything anyway. Joy-girls have nothing on you. What good is selling the body when the spark is offered for free?***
"It's ok. Look at me.â€ he spoke with some force in his voice to get her attention, which worked. "It's ok." His hands fell to his sides, therefore her thighs, and patted them. "It might be easier to talk if you weren't sitting on my chest." He gave a slight chuckle that made her move slightly as she sat there.
Naryen felt her face warm with a blush as she stared at his face for a moment, which showed a genuine smile seemingly as an attempt to lighten the awkwardness of the moment. ***No, he's not mocking you.*** She quickly stood and abruptly stepped back from him. She opened her mouth to apologize, again, but simply closed her mouth and hung her head slightly finding she couldnâ€™t look him in the face. She extended a hand to help him up as another attempt to apologize. The hand to hand instructor that she trained with at the Academy would have laughed so hard at this and she imagined his mocking tone saying ***If only youâ€™d tried to mount me youâ€™d have been able to accomplish a pin! Ha!*** Then memories from protocol training and the extra effort she had to put in there to overcome her gender.
She flinched back. Helping out like this would also be seen as weakness but the indecision would be worse. ***No need to give him a chance to mock me too and he is on the floor because of me after all.*** She, almost meekly, offers the hand again, which Chase thankfully didnâ€™t wait to take it, and helps him to his feet. Naryen once again tries to word an apology but he stops her efforts by stepping forward and putting his arms around her. No animosity or threat, just a slow embrace which she doesnâ€™t resist. Her body tenses closed as she fights back a wave of tremors.
Close to her ear she hears him speak low and sofly to her "Deidra I'm not your enemy. I don't know what you have been taught about people like me. Whatever it was it has been a one sided story as the victors of wars write the history books. Omitting or changing the events so that they, the victors, don't seem so bad." The meaning and wisdom behind the words resonates with her and the tremors threaten to boil to the surface again. She shivers slightly.
He pulled his head back and separated a bit from her his hands on her hips. Naryen looks up, thankful that he didnâ€™t hold her longer, as looks over his face as he speaks again, his voice still low. "I am not your enemy and neither are the others. You are going to have to trust us. If not them then at least me. But for now maybe we should wait to talk about what I've done till later. Good idea?" He nodded his head a bit and smiled.
Tilting her head forward slightly she closes her eyes and takes a single shivering breath. **â€I wish it was that simple and I agree we need to talk more, later.â€** ***Where last I placed my trust didnâ€™t treat it very well and I donâ€™t trust myself very much.*** She feels more under control as the two of them stand there, together, for minute or so. In a small voice she mutters **â€Weâ€™ve been lied to so much.â€** The weight of the word â€œWeâ€ is overwhelming as she considers the scope of the thought she expressed. We. The people of Varbrindal. Herself. Her parents. Whole star systems and how many others? How many in the Empire thought as she did? How many think as she does now?
How can she make a difference?
She thought about her parents, again, their energy and enthusiasm this time. The values they instilled in her and the values she took from her time in the Empire, the real ones that mattered to her.
***One friend at a time, slowly, thatâ€™s how I can make a difference.***
Naryen looked up at him again and, with a smile that looked more full than she felt, considered him again. ***One at a time.*** Her smile changes, this time seeming more genuine, and whispers **â€Thank-you.â€** as she stands on her toes, placing a light kiss Chases cheek then squeezing him with the side of her head to his chest. A sigh steadies her now that her heart stops trying to bust out through her ribs.
She pulls away, a little, with the same smile then reaches up behind Chases head and roughly messes up his hair this time expressing a small light-hearted giggle. A sound with sharp contrast to what she has been doing up to now and a brief look of wonder flashes across her face. ***When did I really laugh last?*** She smiled again, this time with more energy. She slides her body into her previous role and in a mock husky voice, laden thick with desire, says **â€Letâ€™s go lover, our audience awaits.â€** She pulls him to the door with pressure from her hips and legs and a barely suppressed giggle thatâ€™s less of an act than it had been.
***One at a time. Starting with me.***

**"I am not your enemy and neither are the others. You are going to have to trust us. If not them then at least me. But for now maybe we should wait to talk about what I've done till later. Good idea?"** He nodded his head a bit and smiled.
She stood there before him as he watched her head tilt forward and witnessed the shaky breath she took in. He hoped that she was going to be ok but with all that she had been through he wasn't sure. Any fixing she needed had to come from her. She had to want to change. â€I wish it was that simple and I agree we need to talk more, later.â€
She seemed to gather some strength which surprised Chase a bit. ***So tiny she is but there is no denying that there is a hidden strength deep within her. If only she realized she possessed it.*** He thought to himself as they stood there for a moment. Softly she spoke again. â€Weâ€™ve been lied to so much.â€ He nodded hoping that maybe she had come to realize something. Only time would tell.
Surprisingly she looked up at him again. This time with a smile. looking at her he notices the smile change and possibly a change in attitude or perception as the smile seems to become more genuine. With a whisper of thanks she surprised him my placing a light kiss on his cheek. He gave the same half smile that he had already used several times today only the smile was used for Tar'ja. She gave him another hug this time with her head against his chest. He felt the rewarding sigh that heaved against his chest. He patted her back again. ***Oh boy***
Pulling away she quickly reached up and tussles his hair that was accompanied by a giggle. One that sounded different that the others she had given before. With a voice filled with renewed vigor, not to mention husky sounding with a heavy hint of desire she spoke. â€Letâ€™s go lover, our audience awaits.â€ He body language matched the voice as she lead him towards the door. A giggle told him that she may be enjoying the act now.
Smiling big now next to her he held her close. **"Who am I to argue with a woman and a friend? Lead on."** He gave her a squeeze realizing that he may be her first friend in a long time. It was a good feeling. ***This act certainly didn't turn out how I was expecting. Master Garet was right. The Force can sometimes lead to strange revelations.***
They left the cockpit to go find Dexter and Fosso somewhere in the ship.

**Trouble in the streets of sand**
The sounds of the troopers confusion is short lived as they quickly decide to give chase after your duo. he troopers are heavily armed and armored which makes them difficult to defeat but provides you with an audible clanking of armor to mark their position.
Kasga pauses and waits for Tar`ja to burst through the door way. Throwing a handful of sand to the ground the Duro`s follows the rushed Twi`lek woman inside. Where Tar`ja heads downstairs Kasga closes the door and takes position inside and waits blaster in hand.
((Int trooper: 8, Kasga moves to 13 with a hold, Tar`ja 13))
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Fosso`s Hanger**
Fosso flaps his way through the ships corridor slightly ahead of Dexter. The ships interior is devoid of decoration the ships supplies on minimal reserve. Fosso smiles to the Bothan "Fosso likes contacts maybe this deal be getting better then even the shade." At Dexters mention of more credits the Toydarian`s eyes widen, Fosso scratches his chin when asked to provide a hyper drive. "Fosso be ordering one for you. If I had it I could price it now, hyper drives don`t grow on moisture vaporators you know."
Fosso pauses to consider the request contemplating a plan of action. Behind you a loud thump then a yell "Karkin hell!" can be heard. Fosso smiles then laughs his round belly poking out from his stained shirt. "She be wasting no time that one. You be lucky Fosso not charging for the .... room." Fosso continues to chuckle as your negotiations resume.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Trouble in the streets of sand**
Tar`ja quickly scales down the stairs into a vacant hall which clearly leads to the other side of the building with another set of stair leading up at the end. Finding herself alone Tar`ja pauses o look back for Kasga. The hallway has four closed doors spaced evenly through its length.
Kasga stands with his back to the wall blaster in hand, held tightly for the small amount of security it provides. Over the sound of his own breathing the Duro`s pilot can hear the troopers outside. Seconds later the distinctive clanking of storm trooper armor marches past, then out or hearing range.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Fosso`s Hanger**
Standing in the ships empty hold Dexter and Fosso turn to see Deidra and Chase walk in. Fosso takes one look at the couple then breaks out into a barrel laugh which almost rolls him over as he floats in the air. "Back so soon!" Stated rather then asked the Toydarian calms himself "So you do business with Fosso? I hold the ship for 1000 credits down a small price to pay Fosso thinks to hold the sale rights."

**In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys merchant row.**
"Who am I to argue with a woman and a friend? Lead on." ***As comfortable as I am leading it feels like I have been lead my whole life.*** They walked out of the command deck to the hold, more in step than before it seemed. When they walked into the hold Naryen noticed the look of amusement on Fossos face. The aerial display elicits a smile on Naryens face in spite of the tension of the last few minutes. "Back so soon!" chuckles "So you do business with Fosso? I hold the ship for 1000 credits down a small price to pay Fosso thinks to hold the sale rights."
Naryen stretches along and against Chaseâ€™s side with a moan and a smile that she shows off to Fosso. With the same drawl to Fosso as before: **â€œAs skilled as I amâ€œ** the grin widens with a wink **â€we need more time than we have.â€** she turns back to Chase with a smirk **â€If you guys are gonna talk cash Iâ€™ll go outside.â€** She pinches Chases left buttock and walks out. As she passes Dexter she snags a small amount of neck-hair between her fingers and tugs playfully humming as she goes outside the ship.
***That should establish my place with them to Fosso. I donâ€™t have any cash on me anyway.***
Just as she leaves she yells back. **â€Just remember we have other rides to look at.â€** ***I hope that helps the negotiations.***

Deidra seemed more at ease, more relaxed with the act they had started not so long ago. She lead him through the ship to the cargo hold. He looked down at her and noticed the smile was still there. This time it seemed more genuine than before. ***Maybe I got through to her. Maybe she understands I'm not the enemy.*** He remember the way she just took him down in the cockpit. ***Then again maybe more time will be needed.***
His thought was put on the back burner as they entered the hold. Chase saw Dec and Fosso there talking. Upon noticing the pair Fosso's breaks out laughing. "Back so soon!" Chase realized what was meant and looked to Deidra as the Toydarian continued. "So you do business with Fosso? I hold the ship for 1000 credits down a small price to pay Fosso thinks to hold the sale rights."
***Excellent we may just have a ship to work with. All we need is a hdrive and well be good to go.*** Again he thought breaks down as Deidra basically rubs him down with her body in a way that would make most women blush. A slight moan accompanied the movements as she looks at Fosso. â€œAs skilled as I am...we need more time than we have.â€ Chase didn't see the wink due to his vantage point. But he did see the look on the merchants face and smiled back. Turning back to him she smirked. â€If you guys are gonna talk cash Iâ€™ll go outside.â€ As she turned away her right hand pinched his left buttock. The pinch, which was unexpected, made him jump a bit. He watched her play with some of Dex's neck fur as she walked out. He chuckled slightly. ***Joy-girls have nothing on her.***
From the boarding ramp he head he voice again. â€Just remember we have other rides to look at.â€ He smiled and nodded. ***That's the way to do it Deidra. Work the man and get what you want.*** He remembered the pinch she had just gave him and suddenly wondered who was getting worked.
Chase looked back to Fosso. **"One Thousand credits to hold the ship."** He thought about it for a second and looked to Dexter. As he continued to talk. **"We could give you 750 credits as a holding fee. We have other friends who may want to also look the ship over before it is purchased."** He looked to and then back to Dex. **"Anything else you can think of?"**
Edited for grammar.

Hearing the noise from trooper's passage fade as they move away, Kasga moves toward the stairs, quietly walking down to the hallway below.
Speaking in whisper, Kasga asks, **"They won't be fooled for long. They haven't been breaking down locked doors yet. If we can get inside, we should be able to wait until the patrol moves on. Do you know how to get one of these doors open without breaking the lock?"**

Tar'ja had been about to check the stairs and see where the led in regards to 'up' when she noticed she was alone in the hallway. Sighing she moves quietly back to the stairs only to find the Duro coming down them. "They won't be fooled for long. They haven't been breaking down locked doors yet." reasonable assumption, perhaps they'll even believe they imagined a shadow moving. "If we can get inside, we should be able to wait until the patrol moves on." while the thought didn't sit well with her about staying in one place she could see the logic in that. Her arms cross as she thinks on his words. "Do you know how to get one of these doors open without breaking the lock?"
Her lekku and eye twitch, what did she look like a mechanic?? "I'm a scout. Not a mechanic." she said through clenched teeth, she couldn't help the bursts of temper, she wasn't use to working with an amateur. She turns and points down the hall "there's another set of stairs that lead back up, I don't know where they go but I personally would rather get away from this area then stay. We need to meet up with the others, if you can get a door open, great. But I believe finding a way out would be better."

Dexter listens to Chase and Fosso. "Surely that is reasonable to hold the shi for us. That and my ability to bring you extra bussiness from my contacts that would find your services usefull to say the least. We can give you the credits, and i can contact my supiuors and set eveything in motion." Dexter smiles his warmest smile and trys to convay that is was a good deal. "And if ours freinds agree we can continue our disscustion or price for the ship possiabaly a Hyerdrive if that can be aranged." Dexter hoes that this deal can be arranged so that they can move on with there mission. He looks over at Chase to see if he agrees that this would work for them.

Chase listen to Dexter sweeten the offer with promises of contacts. ***If he can offer what he promises then Fosso might make out better than he thought. and maybe a potential contact for us here in Mos Eisley.***
"And if our friends agree we can continue our discussion or price for the ship possibly a hyperdrive if that can be arranged." Chase nodded as Dexter spoke and looked at him. **"Yes I have the 750 credits right here."** He reached into his bag and opened up the inside pouch and withdrew his credit chip. He looked at the chip. 750 credits was all that it held. It was all that he had left from his time aboard the *Bloodhawk*. Hopefully the droid would pay him back for this. **"There is 750 credits on this. Hopefully this will be enough for the holding fee. We'll go find our other friends and let them know what we found here. How soon would it take for it to be ready to use on planet that is?"** He remembered seeing the systems that were green on the status board. Hopefully the ship was good to go.

**Trouble in the streets** 
Quietly checking a few of the doors in the hall you both notice they are locked. A safe precaution with the current trooper sweep over the city. Behind you are no signs no sounds of pursuit from the two troopers in the alley. Ahead you can hear the normal sounds of the market street slowly coming back to life. Shouts of sales deals and even better sales begin to fill the air. The low mummer of the crowds and the roar of traffic picks up as well.
Up the stair on the other side of the building you open the front entry way door. Outside the locals are returning to the street mixed with only a few pairs of imperial troopers maintaining order. Only the scowls on the faces of the emerging citizens shows any sign of the recent chaos of the imperial martial search.
Realizing how much time has pass Kasga and Tar`ja share knowing looks that their meeting with SBC-54 will be soon. If you are to head left on the street you will meet up with Chase and the others. To the right the Melt Down Cafe and the upcoming meeting with the protocol droid.
--------------------------------------
**Fosso`s Hanger**
Fosso hovers in place shaking his head back and forth almost turning himself completely around. "No`s Fosso be needing the wholes amount. Fosso can sell this ship to anyone but Fosso has a feeling you`s be taking care of her." Fosso smiles at the Bothan and pulls a small data pad out of his vest pocket motioning Dexter to take a look at it. "This is my com signal. I be your Tatooine contact and you be given me your signal too."
Fosso rubs the stubble on his chin in thought. "I tell you what if no one else comes for the ship and you can come up with the remaining credits we can start our deal." Fosso quickly swipes the credits from Chases hand his smile widens. "I will be waiting for your signal but do not make Fosso wait to long others be wanting passage off world."
Your group realizes the passage of time since you group separated from Kasga Tar`ja and SBC-54. The meeting with the droid at the Melt Down Cafe will be soon.

Looking over toward Tar'ja as he returns his pistol to it's holster, Kasga says, **"It's about time to meet the droid again. I think we can mix with the crowd. I hope the others had better luck than we did. You ready to go?"**

### **Yogi** (2009-05-12 12:39:44)

**Fosso's Hanger**
Chase began to become worried as he watched Fosso. He believed that he sensed frustration coming from the winged alien but he wasn't so sure. Besides the facial expressions of the alien weren't the easiest to read. His heart sank a bit as Fosso spoke. "No`s Fosso be needing the wholes amount. Fosso can sell this ship to anyone but Fosso has a feeling you`s be taking care of her." A data pad was produced and show to Dexter. "This is my com signal. I be your Tatooine contact and you be given me your signal too."
**"Does this…"** Chase began but he was cut off my the quick talking merchant who was rubbing his chin. "I tell you what if no one else comes for the ship and you can come up with the remaining credits we can start our deal." A quick swipe and the credits were gone from his hand. Chase gave the merchant a look as Fosso's smile widened. "I will be waiting for your signal but do not make Fosso wait to long others be wanting passage off world."
Chase nodded. **"If we can come up with the 250 I'll be back. It will be soon if I do."**  He looked at his chrono and realized that time was getting close to meet back with SBC-54. Hopefully Kasga and Tar'ja would be there. He hope that they were all right since they had not met up with them here at Fosso's. He looked over his shoulder towards the exit. Deidra was outside probably looking around. Shifting his gaze back to Dex he nodded. **"We should get going and meet up with the others and see what they have found. I think we found a good deal here and we should let them know."**
With a wave to Fosso he turned and left the cargo hold. He stopped at the bottom of the lift just in case Dex was finishing up. He walked towards Deidra and slid his arm around her the act on again for Fosso. He smiled at her as he did so. **"You ready to go love. We need to find the others for extra 250 in credits to hold the ship for us."** He checked his comlink. **"They haven't contacted us since the last time. I hope she…they are alright. If they had the same type of run in we did it might turn out differently than ours."** Chase's slip about Tar'ja's well being was obvious and slight reddening of his cheeks along with a slight stiffness in his body language confirmed it.
He waited till they were all together again before leaving for the meeting with SBC-54. Once out of sight from Fosso's chase looked down at Deidra. The act had been fun yet draining for the both of them. Both Deidra and he had found out some things about each other. The important one being that maybe they can trust the one who used to be the enemy, time would tell. He smiled as he looked into her eyes he saw some measure of trust that wasn't there when they began this. He looked behind him. **"I think we can stop the act now we're out of sight. Sound good to you?"**

Dexter takes the datapad from Fosso and copys the information to his datapad and then puts his comm signal down for Fosso. "I will forward this information to my superiors and I am sure they will be in contact with you." Dexter looks over at Chase. "Is this statifactory my friend. At least he is willing to hold the ship for us and I have a feeling that he is a being of his word." Dexter hopes that Chase will agree to this and they can move to what ever other bussiness they had here.

### **Rebaav** (2009-05-13 10:54:48)

**In Fossos Hanger in Mos Eisleys Merchant Row.**
Naryen stood outside the ship, at the base of the gang-plank, arms crossed and frowning in thought. Her head is titled down slightly and she is leaning against a hydraulic arm that lowers the plank from the ship. ***Iâ€™m better than this. Iâ€™ve been in stressful situations before and have always risenâ€¦ no, thrived on the challenge!*** She wondered if the drug of the thrill, sheâ€™d lived with most of her life, was finally being rejected by her.
She was so lost in thought that she didnâ€™t fully notice Chases approach until he slid his arm around her side to her hip. The pace and position of the touch was familiar and so not intrusive. Naryen didnâ€™t leap to arms this time, simply smiled and leaned into him, relaxed. She closed her eyes then opened then, wider, without the smile. ***Do I just trust too easily?*** She shook the thought away and slipped into the behavior role they had established.
"You ready to go love. We need to find the others for extra 250 in credits to hold the ship for us." He checked his comlink. "They haven't contacted us since the last time. I hope she... they are alright.â€ His posture shifted slightly at this. Naryen considered that she would have noticed the slip even without the added help. She looked up to see him blushing noticeably. She couldnâ€™t help but smile. ***So the true measure of trust is of how vulnerable, to those you place you trust in, you allow yourself to be? On some level he felt he could share that with me otherwise he wouldnâ€™t have reacted like that.*** â€œIf they had the same type of run in we did it might turn out differently than ours."
Naryen pitches her voice low, for the two of them, but acts as they have been; nuzzled into Chases chest with a near-feral smile and pressing the rest of herself to his side. **â€Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re fine. Iâ€™ve witnessed myself how capable Tarâ€™ja seems to be. If Kasga is a small measure as capable as he seems to be they should be alright.â€** Naryen considered how hearing herself say that out loud made her feel better just then. ***Looks like Iâ€™ve been worried too.*** The light clawing/neading of his stomach changed, for a moment, soft but firm grip intending to convey some reassurance to Chase.
They walked together, from Fossos, into Merchant Row. Naryen started looking for Trooper patrols when Chase asked "I think we can stop the act now we're out of sight. Sound good to you?" Naryen barely paused before answering with the same low voice. **â€In case we come across troopers again I think we should remain this way so that there isnâ€™t a sudden shift that they would notice.â€** She smiled and gave his ass a squeeze, easily viewed from behind, then did her best impression of Chases voice, **â€Just a joy-girl and her mark, nothing to see here.â€** which turned out much closer than she expected. She jolted slightly, startled as to how close that was and nearly bursts out laughing. It stifles into a teary gasp and she wipes her eyes. ***No, not ready to laugh like that just yet.*** She cuddles closer to Chase drawing on him for some small amount of comfort.
The irony of a â€¦ former citizen of the Empire seeking refuge with a... Jedi? was not lost on her.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-05-13 14:16:56)

With Deidra nuzzling into his chest and her voice pitched low she spoke to him. â€Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re fine. Iâ€™ve witnessed myself how capable Tarâ€™ja seems to be. If Kasga is a small measure as capable as he seems to be they should be alright.â€ He simply nodded as he continued to walk with her. Something she said stayed with him. 'Iâ€™ve witnessed myself how capable Tarâ€™ja seems to be'.
***Interesting. There seems to be much more to it than what I glimpsed from the two of them back in the cantina. Deidra an officer in charge and Tar'ja a non-human on an Imperial undergoing lock down. I wonder.*** He felt the soft but reassuring grip of her hand on his stomach. It seems that she was trying to show him some reassurance. ***Maybe I'm wearing off on her.***
His question to her about dropping the act was met with some resistance. â€In case we come across troopers again I think we should remain this way so that there isnâ€™t a sudden shift that they would notice.â€ He had to agree with her thinking. His head did a sudden turn as he looked at her when she gave his ass a squeeze. Then in her best impression of him she mimicked what he did to the troopers back at Fosso's. â€Just a joy-girl and her mark, nothing to see here.â€ He smiled big has he nearly watched her burst with laughter. ***So you can loosen up a bit. Good.*** He thought as he felt her nuzzle in closer. He gave her a squeeze with the arm that was around her.
His head was slightly above Deidra's as she spoke again not ashamed for anyone to hear him. **"Just so you know you're getting way to comfortable having your hand there."** He said with a chuckle that she felt since she was on him again like a second skin.

Tar'ja had taken to staring off into space to the left, Chase and the others were over there...hopefully they had secured them a ship, and hopefully he and the others didn't have a run in like they did.
"...You ready to go?" her head snaps back to the Duro, blinking once as her mind repeated quickly what was said. The Twi'lek nods her head and takes another look to the left "Yea..I'm ready." Shifting thoughts of certain roguishly handsome human men, namely one, to the back of her mind she takes a few glances around the alleyway before stepping out and motioning to the Duro the Twi'lek moves to the shadows and sighs "well...it's either sneak around to the cantina again, or pretend like we live here and going for a drink."
Glancing to the Duro she gives him a once over and sighs as she moves to his side, sliding her arm in his and glances at him "Hope this works. Just..be natural, you're a normal Duro who caught an oddly colored Twi'lek and likes to show her off." she scowls at the thought, she hated these kinds of things but, she was getting a bit tired and after the last shadow walk she didn't really trust him to keep from kicking a rock.
She sighs and rolls her shoulders before, dropping them slightly, pulling herself tall but keeping her head slightly down, not enough to be submissive in appearance but enough to look like she knows her place "For the record.." she mumbles to him "you touch me in anyway I don't like, I'm taking your hand off." With that lovely little warning she tugs his arm to get going towards the Cantina. All the while muttering in her head to stop looking death at people.

Kasga is bit surprised when she takes his arm. He stumbles along as she leads him away, trying his best to look like he does this every day. Her idea of a con seems a bit exposed. He's further shocked by her warning. Not trusting himself to speak, he walks along in silence trying not to look shocked.
After a bit, he murmers, **"I'm surprised to find that you live in a galaxy in which you would expect that of me."**

**Mos Eisleys Merchant row**
Fosso flaps his way out of the hanger escorting potential buyers. With the promise of a sale so near the stub Toydarians attitude has become even more friendly towards your group. Out side in the scrap yard the Jawa is still watching over the business though not as diligently as when you left him. The little Jawa jumps to his feet at the sight of Fosso and hastily begins wiping down the side of a parts speeder. "Mambay mambay, nekkel juuvar obwegadada."
The market streets are beginning to fill again with only a few pairs or troopers and the local scowls to so signs of the recent incursion into their daily routines. On the horizon a large storm can be seen, even from so far away the local winds have picked up as has the market pace to get in a few last sales in case the worst was to happen. Your group starts off for the Melt Down Cafe to meet up with SBC-54 and hopefully your other .... friends.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Melt Down Cafe**
Entering the streets you easily mix into the growing crowds and begin for the Melt Down Cafe. On the horizon a large storm is forming, darkness spreads and sand is blown around making the planet that much more uncomfortable.
The small cantina has not changed much since you left it. Inside the same locals sit nursing drinks or passed out, the same band plays the same three songs over and over. Along the walls the few working monitors play an important imperial broadcast.
Smoking ruins half collapsed buildings and dead scattered throughout. Smoke and destruction are captured throughout the entire city. The city looks like it had been well populated possibly a mid rim worlds judging from the level of comfort once enjoyed there. The sound is off but the words stream across the words "Rebel attack on Varbrindal! No survivors." The message plays a few more times then is replaced by a droid contact sport game.
Your booth waits empty for your group and you see no signs of SBC-54 or the others. The multi armed bar tender nods to you then motions to the booth where you take your seats and wait.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Reunion**
Tar`ja and Kasga wait is not long as Dexter Chase and Deidra walking in. Chase and Deidra standing close to each other separate as soon as they are inside. The trio notice the booth and take their seats. Chase and Deidra go to sit side by side then seem to change their minds last second and sit opposite of each other. Dexter takes a seat his head buried in a data pad with schematics of an old Gysnor-2 freighter.
Before your group has much time to get reacquired the droid SBC-54 walks in through the side entrance. With a try in hand the droid sets drinks at your table, drinks that where not ordered. In a low voice SBC states matter of factually "What has been your progress?"

**Mos Eisley, Merchant row**
The three of them walked along as life began to come back to Merchant row. With the passing of the troopers the locals found the courage to retake the streets to find or pedal their wares. Only a few pairs of troopers could be seen now which suited chase just fine. Chase was sure that Deidra, even though she was playing her part of the joy-girl, was keeping a careful eye out as well. Looking to the right over Deidra he saw Dexter keeping an eye out as well. ***Good the more alert we all are the better.*** Looking to the sky Chase couldn't help but notice the approaching storm. **"We better hurry up."** He said to both of them. **"That storm is coming and who knows how long it will take to get here."** He increased his pace slightly as he held onto Deidra. His long legs forcing the shorter woman to quicken her steps even more. With the storm coming he doubted they wold look out of place hurrying along to someplace safe.
**Melt Down Cafe**
As They approached the entrance to the *Melt Down Cafe* Chase looks around. **"I hope they made it back all right. With all that's happened it seems like it's been more than an hour since we split up."**  He took the few steps to the door and entered. The light was simmer in here than outside. Even though the storm was coming it was still bright outside. He figured it would stay that way till the storm rolled over Mos Eisley. Upon entering he let go of Deidra and smiled. **"Finally we can stop."**  He said as he brushed down his shirt. Looking around the saw the table they had been at before. And to his delight he saw them there, Tar'ja and Kasga. Both looked alright. Tar'ja looked just as she did when the group separated. ***Come on Chase it wasn't even an hour ago.*** He thought as he walked up to the table with the others.
He motioned for Deidra to sit and almost sat down next to her. He looked at her and he could see Tar'ja in his peripheral vision. Having been so close to the former Imperial for the past hour he almost kept up with the act again. Realizing that he didn't have to he took a step to the left and sat down. He slid over to make room not sure if Dex was going to sit next to him or Deidra. As he slid over he came closer to Tar'ja, all thought of Dexter has been forgotten when he looked into her blue eyes. ***You barely know her and already your thinking about her more than the last one you had a relationship with.*** He gave her the same smile he did when he left. **"How was your outing? Run into any unwanted friends like we did?"** He looked to Kasga quickly and then back to Tar'ja waiting for a response.
-------
**OOC:** leaving a bit of space for some conversation.

**IC:**
The groups time to catch up was cut short. As much as he wanted to talk about what had happened with their little trip SBC-54 entered from the side entrance try in hand that was laden with drinks. Seeing the drinks he realized how thirsty he was and reached for the one closest. It was a Corellian ale like he had had last time they were here. The droid wasted no time in getting down to business.
"What has been your progress?"
Chase nodded to Dexter Data pad still in his hand Chase kept his voice low.**"Dex has the schematics of a ship we found. It's old and missing a hyperdrive but It's pretty sound and ready to go. But since we're blockaded right now the hdrive doesn't matter much. 14k for the ship. The seller wanted 1k down to hold it. All we had was 750 so he still needs the rest to consider it held and he wants it soon. Other than not having some other non-essential systems it's probably the best were gong to find on such short notice."** He made it a point to not point out that it was also missing a shield generator and a weapon system. If they wanted to know they would ask and he figured they would.
Chase looked to Deidra and then to Dexter to see if either of them had anything more to add.

Tar'ja glances up to the sky slightly as they make they're way into the cantina "Storm brewing." she mumbles to him as they finally enter the safety of the Cantina, once inside she drops the Duro's arm and walks further ahead, nodding to the bartender as she takes a seat with a sigh.
It didn't take long before Chase was in her peripheral vision. A faint glimmer of a smile crosses her lips at the sight of him, glad that he was alright. She did catch the odd movement of him moving to sit next to the imperial but seemed to have changed his mind; for which she was very thankful. She couldn't help the odd flush as he sat close to her, though a frown crosses her features at the mention of 'unwanted friends.'
She rests her hand on his leg glaring at the table then up to him "I am not letting you out of my sight again." The whole ordeal would have been much easier and far more enjoyable had Chase been with them, never mind the fact that having *any* human would have made the ordeal easier.

Dexter doesn't even take his eyes off the datapad when he specks. "We where able to also make a contact out of our new friend. With alittle promise of bring him more bussiness from my associates and he seem interested in doing bussiness with us." Dexter keeps pooring over the plans for the ship that he was hopeing they would be getting. "All we need is the credits and we have what we need."

**Melt Down Cafe, before SBC arrives**
At the mention of 'unwanted friends' he noticed her frown. He also picked up on her body language. Se seemed happy that he was sitting close to her again. He smiled when he felt her hand rest gently on his leg as her gaze shifted from the table to him. "I am not letting you out of my sight again." He raised an eyebrow at that as he looked into her eyes. Her touch was soft.
His smile never left as he placed his left hand over hers and gave it a slight squeeze. **"That Tar'ja, is not an unwelcome idea."** He took a breath and let it out. ***Not an unwelcome idea at all.***

### **zerah** (2009-05-18 16:15:05)

Tar'ja's expression softens slightly with the reassurance that he didn't seem to mind the idea. That soft light smile that had graced her features before they had split up, returned as she looked to him; it seemed almost as though that particular expression was reserved for the human, but was that simple arrogance or truth?
"Good." she says softly, his hand on hers made her stomach flip and her lekku twitch along her back, though the moment seemed so short lived when the droid arrived. The smile faded back to her typical expression as she watched the droid then Chase, taking in the events.
They had a ship then, just needed to come up with the rest to hold it and they would have a ship "It's better than what we have, Kasga and I made it to the farm alright but the ship was gone. Your find is the only option it seems." She nods to Chase, it seemed best, maybe they could steal a hyperdrive later.

*A ship!* Kasga's spirits lift at Chase's report. Apparently, Chase's group had better luck. The lack of a hyperdrive is a problem. The Imperial presence here would make acquiring one difficult. Turning toward the Bothan, Kasga asks, **"Can I see those?"**, gesturing toward the datapad.

**Mos Eisley: Merchant row. En route to Melt Down CafÃ©** 
"We better hurry up. That storm is coming and who knows how long it will take to get here." ***No argument here.*** The wind was picking up and the dry air was mixed with sand. It snarled at Naryens face and she turned into Chase to shield herself from it as their pace quickened to get out of the street. She was used to moving fast through drills and the hallways in Imperial facilities so keeping pace with Chase was almost normal walking to her. Being wrapped around him and shielding her face from blowing grit was not normal and she stumbled slightly as she wiped some sand, gently, from her face. The radiation burn had started to set-in from earlier in the day and it particularly stung her cheeks and eyes. ***I probably look like I have a permanent blush on my face. A dessert environments, it seems, is not something I like too much.*** as she flinched from the occasional wind blown bits. The few troopers they saw looked to not be interested in them as they went back to meet their contact. ***Just so with a storm coming.***
As They approached the entrance to the *Melt Down Cafe* Chase looks around. "I hope they made it back all right. With all that's happened it seems like it's been more than an hour since we split up." Naryen looked up at Chase briefly with a curious expression on her face. ***Interesting. I thought her independence was something he admired in her. Are all Jedi such chauvinists?*** He said something to her, then, but it barely registered. The wind had blown some tears from her face, that stung her burn now, but her attention was on the viewer as they entered. ***Varbrindal! Rebels? So thatâ€™s the story theyâ€™re going with. Typical scapegoats for an organization thatâ€™s failing in its mandate, itâ€™s those that resist it that are to blame. Never mind that itâ€™s supposedly built to succeed in spite of and indeed because of resistors. Would others be so quick to admit their failing as publicly as news cast as the Empire?*** Naryen stood there, dirty face and all, stunned for a moment at the venom in the cold reasoning that lashed out at the logical failing of the reports.
As an overly gleeful newsbot followed her mood soured. She walked to the table where she saw others familiar to her and, at Chaseâ€™s motions, took a seat. Seeing Chases discomfort at switching behaviors Naryen smiled, even though it stung her face. She took a medicated cream and cleanser from her kit and applied the latter to her face. She looked around the table to see if any of the others needed it then applied it to her own, being in obvious need. ***Iâ€™ll need to update a blocking agent for myself.***
Chase started the discussion with. "How was your outing? Run into any unwanted friends like we did?" He looked to Kasga quickly and then back to Tar'ja waiting for a response. Naryen thought about the confrontation with the troopers and her mood worsened again. ***What are the chances that that trooper recognized meâ€¦ next to zero but thatâ€™s how the universe works. Stillâ€¦*** She almost didnâ€™t hear Tarâ€™ja say to Chase "I am not letting you out of my sight again." ***Ah, the feeling is mutal, so much the better then.*** Naryen smiles for a moment then looks at Dexter with a more business-like expression and pitches her voice for the group **"If someone has pad configured for public terminal access, could I use it a moment please?"**
"What has been your progress?" SBC had not waited and went to their table right away, almost like there was no other business in the place. Naryen shot the droid an annoyed look before she casts her glance down to collect herself. ***Wow. I need to calm down.***
Chase, not wanting to waste time, nodded to Dexter Data pad still in his hand Chase kept his voice low. "Dex has the schematics of a ship we found. It's old and missing a hyperdrive but It's pretty sound and ready to go. But since we're blockaded right now the hdrive doesn't matter much. 14k for the ship. The seller wanted 1k down to hold it. All we had was 750 so he still needs the rest to consider it held and he wants it soon. Other than not having some other non-essential systems it's probably the best were gong to find on such short notice." Chase looked to Deidra and then to Dexter.
Naryen took it as a cue: **"If there is another transport awaiting us outside the blockade ours missing a hyper may be less important than it missing shields and weapons."** She glances at Chase, with a blank look, wondering why he didnâ€™t mention that. **"If we are on our own then it missing a hyper is significant, though it seems to be the best we could get in only an hour."** She didnâ€™t hide the grimace on her face.
Dexter answered without looking up from his pad. "We where able to also make a contact out of our new friend. With a little promise of bring him more bussiness from my associates and he seem interested in doing bussiness with us. All we need is the credits and we have what we need."
Naryen heard the discussion and notices the changes in body language between Tarâ€™ja & Chase. "That Tar'ja, is not an unwelcome idea." He took a breath and let it out. She said back to him "Good." Once again Naryen thought of Thomas and once again she felt her stomach flutter and a puzzled expression come across her face. The burn on her forehead gave a tingling sensation as she scowled slightly and she listened to Tarâ€™ja bring her attention back into the briefing. "It's better than what we have, Kasga and I made it to the farm alright but the ship was gone. Your find is the only option it seems." That disappointed her greatly. At least that ship was a known element with Tarâ€™ja. This ship from Fosso would be unknown to them all. ***Spoiled from having everything you ever needed ready for you, hmm?*** Her thoughts chastised herself. This is becoming a poor habbit.
Kasga's expression brightens at Chase's report, and asks of the Bothan "Can I see those?", while gesturing to Dexters pad. Having heard noone else specify Naryen volunteered: **"We didnâ€™t secure any leads from Fosso on a hyperdrive though he did say he could aquire one for an additional fee."** Her expression was less hopeful than her tone, clearly distracted.

Dexter looks up from his datapad and looks at Kasga. "Sure, here you go. I need the Datapad back it has other stuff on it that I need." Dexter switches gears. "No we couldn't get the hyperdrive but the ship will work for our use." And he starts to look outside at the weather. "We need to be getting back the Fosso's if we are going to close this deal." Dexter starts to get up from the table where they were setting. "So we in agreement then?"

### **Yogi** (2009-05-20 15:20:30)

Chase listened to the others as he sat next to Tar'ja. His hand still held hers that rested on his leg. It was a good feeling that touch inspired in him. Dex caught his attention when he mentioned the storm. "We need to be getting back the Fosso's if we are going to close this deal." It was then that the Bothan started to get up and Chase just looked at him incrediously. "So we in agreement then?"
Chase just shook his head side to side as his amazement continued to show. He leaned forward. A hint of irritation was in his low voice. **"No Dex. We haven't heard from our potential employer on this yet…"** He was surprised at how quick this...spy was to jump into action with out all the information available. **"Because if he can't swing the credits to purchase the ship then we're done here. Think about it a bit, we can't just rush off on a thought right now. Lets her SBC out and then we can make a decision to go back and close the deal."**  He looked at Deidra. His own thoughts were probably matching the former Imperials and she was probably more likely to look harshly upon impulsive team members than he was.
He squeezed Tar'ja's hand slightly as his frustration with the Bothan's ability to just run off showed through yet again. Slowly and calmly he began a relaxation technique. This was going to be a long day. He looked at SBC-54. **"What do you think about what we have found? Will it work for you?"**
EDIT: for grammar and just so a sentence would make sense as I typed it up real quick.

The Bothan's excitement, while endearing, was making the lilac Twi'lek's eye twitch. It was a great relief when Chase spoke up first, as her hand was starting to twitch to her blaster wondering if a shot by his ear would get him to understand they can't move that fast yet.
The hand on hers though, the squeeze showed her just how much Chase felt about the Bothan as she did. Looking to the human she gives him a suffering look in her eyes, her lekku twitching in frustration, was she really surrounded by amateurs? save the imperial and Chase it seemed the others were simple recruits with little to no former training!
She was starting to wonder how those two survived whatever it was that got them here. Choosing to hold her tongue until she was calmer though, Tar'ja says nothing, only grasping Chase's hand to keep her temper.

Dexter stops, Chase was right he needed to be more paitent then he was being. "Sorry, I guess i am letting my excitement get the better of me." Dexter set back down and finds something to keep himself busy. He looks over at Kasga. "Can I borrow your datapad I am going to check the news." He looks around the Cafe. It was the same as anyother premacreat building on this planet. Sure it was decerated differtly then the others. He flags down one of the waitress and orders some Caf. "I realize that sometimes I can seem alittle impatient, but I am good at what I do. Trust me." Dexter smiles. He realizes that non of them belive him but that went with the job.

### **galenbd** (2009-05-21 09:47:38)

As Dexter passed the datapad over, Deirdra spoke up. Kasga caught, **"If there is another transport awaiting us outside the blockade ours missing a hyper may be less important than it missing shields and weapons.**
Kasga looks up, **"Wait, what! no hyper, shields or weapons. Let me see that!"** reaching for the datapad impatiently.
The others talk around him while Kasga absorbs the ship's readout muttering to himself.
Frustrated, Kasga looks up as Dexter asks to look at the datapad again. Kasga passes it back with a frustrated push. Realizing his intemperance, he mumbles an apology. Sitting back, he takes a deep breath and lets it out again.
Trying to speak slowly in spite of his disappointment, he says, **"As it stands, this ship will not escape this blockage. Even if the blockagers are incompetent, the forces that will meet us on the other end of our hyperspace jump will not be. Without shields and weapons, our possible contingencies become unrealistic."**

Tar'ja moves a hand to her belt and produces a data pad, setting it on the table and pushing it towards the ex-imperial. "Here, should be able to access what you need." Looking over to Kasga she nods "True, we need those things, but will it be enough to simply get us to the crash site? If a ship has crashed and unable to run we can simply take the things we need from it."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-05-22 00:01:24)

Chase listened and watched the others. His own frustration got the better of him. He wasn't used to the impulsiveness of others. Especially Dexter who on a whim could just walk off oblivious to what is going on around him. He felt Tar'ja holding his hand. With out even looking at her he could feel the frustration flowing from the beautiful Twi'lek. Kasga was disappointed in the old ship. Chase could understand that. Maybe get a ship only to find out it's a real piece of junk. The emotions he felt were worrisome. They were poised to fail before really even starting the mission.
Chase leaned back and took a drink of the Corellian ale he had in front of him. He thought of Master Garet and what words of insight he may have for him or all of them for that matter. Nothing really stood out till the last second as Tar'ja passed a datapad to Deidra who had requested one.
*"The force will see you through if you believe, that is your power young Chase that is the power of the Jedi."* The voice of Garet floated through his head. He gave a slight half chuckle. The power of belief. In believing that something can be done, it can happen. They had to try. ***Try.*** The word brought back something the droid has said earlier something about not trying. He wracked his brain trying to remember. A quick second later he had it. *'Then we will have already failed. In my experience one is doomed to fail if one does not even try.'* That was it.
He looked at the others the ship wasn't great but it was what they had available. His voice was still low but loud enough for the table. New enthusiasm was evident in his voice. **"Look the ship isn't great I know that, but it *will* get the job done for us. We go get the prize before anyone else and then wait. SBC has the coordinates on where to go and right now and with the blockade that isn't very far. If we have to lie low we can use that time to secure a hdrive and what ever else we can from either the downed ship while we're there or Fosso. The longer we sit around here the more chance we take that someone else will find the prize. We have a lot of talent here. Deidra who knows how the Imps work, protocol and procedure. Dex who has the contacts. Kasga who can fly just about anything. Tar'ja who can work the shadows. And then there's me."** When he mentioned himself he looked at Deidra. He didn't want to mention here what went down in the cockpit. The look he got from Deidra confirmed it. **"What I'm saying is if we set out to do it we can. Faster and better than the others."**
He looked around the Table. **"If we don't try it will be like what SBC said earlier, 'Then we will have already failed. In my experience one is doomed to fail if one does not even try.'"**  As he quoted the droid Chase looked up at their "server". **"Which I must say I have heard that exact quote before. I can't remember where but I have heard it."**

SBC-54 pauses as you continue your conversation. The droid stares blankly at your group with its servos tilted to the side giving his head a slightly sideways position. The droid studies your group and the interactions between each of you as you debate the success of the mission.
Then SBC-54 moves to look at the data pad, over Kasga`s shoulder the droid scans the information. "Corellian a fine choice." The droid continues to scan the pads schematics while listening to your group.
As Chase try`s to boast the groups moral SBC-54 perks up and looks at the human for a moment. "My calculations indicate a fair probability for salvage on this planet. Many native and foreign inhabitants even make a living from this worlds salvage prospects." The droid is matter of factually in his statement. "This Fosso I know of his location, I will complete the arrangement for the transport. Unfortunately the empire has a current blockade in place. Any ship lifting off will be shot down and time is running out. I would request that you continue by land and begin the search before the empire finds our missing ship."
SBC-54 pauses again to allow his words time to reach your group. As usual the locals pay little to no attention to your conversation, and the monitors continue to play a droid combat game while the band begins another round of the same three songs. "Are there any questions?"

Kasga opens his mouth to respond indignantly, when the droid pipes up. **Unfortunately the empire has a current blockade in place. Any ship lifting off will be shot down and time is running out. I would request that you continue by land and begin the search before the empire finds our missing ship.**
Kasga blows out hotly and chomps shut. **"That's exactly the problem. I suggest we use speeders while the hyperdrive gets installed. We do the pickup on the speeders and book it back here for the takeoff. They may not let us out with speeders, but I think the animals will be too slow."**
Kasga turns to SBC-54, **"There's a storm coming. We may have to wait until it passes. You say time is running out. How much time do we really have?"**

**Mos Eisley: Melt Down CafÃ©** 
Naryen, looking a little paler than usual, takes the offered pad, with a smile of appreciation. She nods support to Tarâ€™jas mention of salvage to obtain the needed ship parts. ***Thereâ€™s entire economies based around Imperial refuse why should this place be any different?*** Her focus, however, is clearly on other things as she accesses the pads pub-net display and pulls a history of the current feed. The upload of the local system is ridiculously slow and Naryen finds her patience wearing thin, a clear sign of the stress sheâ€™s experiencing. Chases omission of his skills barely registers, as she looks for the article she had seen on her way in, but she does glance up to him with a small smile that shows more than a trace of being genuine in an attempt to offer some support.
"What I'm saying is if we set out to do it we can. Faster and better than the others." ***That remains to be seen. Refuse of personnel as we are.*** She listens while Chase tries to bolster morale of a group facing such limited prospects. Having been in a leader role for so much of her life, and still very unsure of herself, she welcomes respite.
SBC-54 offers, with some mimicked enthusiasm, agreement with the assessment of salvage potential and Naryen considers that she may not like droids much. "This Fosso I know of his location, I will complete the arrangement for the transport. Unfortunately the empire has a current blockade in place. Any ship lifting off will be shot down and time is running out. I would request that you continue by land and begin the search before the empire finds our missing ship." ***Interesting.***
"Are there any questions?" ***More than we appear to have time for, as youâ€™ve indicated, my autonomous recorder.***
"That's exactly the problem. I suggest we use speeders while the hyperdrive gets installed.â€ ***Splitting up again is certainly an option.*** â€We do the pickup on the speeders and book it back here for the takeoff. They may not let us out with speeders, but I think the animals will be too slow." ***A valid point to be sure.*** Naryen nods with more invested agreement and was about to ask if anyone has looked into speeders when he continued to the droid. "There's a storm coming. We may have to wait until it passes. You say time is running out. How much time do we really have?" ***Would the storm cover us?*** Naryen was just about to voice that idea, and ask SBC for more details, when the query came back and she looked down at the pad. Her stomach followed as the feed loaded and played.
(((OCC: *tosses the ball to Tru* Yes I know she didn't say anything but coming from the Hanger/troopers episode to that news feed she's not that talkative anyway.)))

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-05-22 15:28:41)

Chase wasn't surprised that SBC-54 ignored the coment about hearing the quote before. He listened to the droid talk about finishing up the purchase of the ship. Kasga made a good point. "That's exactly the problem. I suggest we use speeders while the hyperdrive gets installed. We do the pickup on the speeders and book it back here for the takeoff. They may not let us out with speeders, but I think the animals will be too slow."
He nodded at the statement as it was an accurate one. They would need speeders which meant more credits were needed. Chase watched the Duro turn to the droid. "There's a storm coming. We may have to wait until it passes. You say time is running out. How much time do we really have?"
Chase sat back as he waited for the droid to answer. His shoulder rubbed against Tar'j's as he did. Her hand was still in his. Despite the possibility of a hard life her hands were surprisingly soft. It was nice, for lack of a better word, to be close to her. But he knew it wouldn't always be lke this. ***Might as well enjoy it while I can.*** He thought as he gave her hand a small squeeze.
He spoke up about the storm. **"The storm may be just what we need. It may cover out search efforts and give us a head start in finding it. Besides if the storm goes on for any length of time it could cover up the crash site making it that much harder to find it."** He also looked to SBC. **"If we now need a speeder big enough to carry the cargo that means we need more credits. Are you able to cover the cost of a speeder in addition to the transport? Also how big is this cargo? Do we need a speeder truck or will something smaller suffice?**
Edited for grammar.

### **zerah** (2009-05-22 18:00:55)

Tar'ja listens to all that's being said, taking comfort in the feel of Chase's shoulder against hers and his hand in hers. The small part of her mind that wasn't occupied with plans of the hunt and money was enjoying the attention and wondered how long it would last.
"It seems there are many questions that have yet to be answered and many revolve around what we're actually doing and money. It seems safe to say that we need large budget to accommodate everything we need." She looks to the droid "you will be able to provide the money and our own salary." It wasn't so much a question as it was a statement and demand, she'd be damned if they weren't going to get paid simply because the budget wasn't figured correctly.
Glancing to the human beside her she gives his hand a squeeze after he squeezed hers, with a faint tilt of her lip in a smile to him that faded quickly when her attention moved to the droid.

**The Melt Down Cafe**
The droid nods as your group continues to debate the next course of action. Still watching your behaviours as you each share your ideas, even watching Dexter as he uploads files from the cafe`s open interface terminal.
Dexter smiles the systems in this cafe like so many over the planet itself are rudimentary and sluggish, it took longer then the Bothan would have liked but he was easily able to download the most recent events. Taking a seat with the group Dexter holds the data pad stored safely with fresh data. The news cast of Varbrindal has been only recently announced but playing every half hour, a few more warning posters of the empires most wanted, several droid games and warning in the Barrivnor System of pirate activity. The empire has dispatched a small fleet to intercept the issue.
SBC-54 gaze sets on Chase as the human questions the mission. The droid nods "You will need to transport several tons at least. The ship was carrying acidic resistant compounds vital to some of the rebellions missions and more importantly a large stock pile of Bacta. I do not have to tell you of its importance many military and non-military personal alike are in desperate need of those medical supplies."
At Tar`jas statement SBC-54 changes its focus to the Twi`lek "If compensation is your concern then fear not the rebellion has many wealthy supporters. I do not have the authority to discus salary but." The droid produces a small brown leather bag tied tightly at the top. "Consider this an advancement, I will complete your transaction with this Fosso and you will contact me when you have found the missing ship. Unfortunately out there you are on your own we have no army here to back you up."
SBC-54 passes Tar`ja the bag inside is 1000 credits, or 200 each. SBC-54 exchanges com codes with Dexter then turns to exit the establishment. "I would hope that our information of your group is correct and I wish I could be of further assistance." The droid pauses "You will do fine. May the force be with you all." SBC-54 continues out of the cafe and disappears through the main entrance.

### **zerah** (2009-05-26 13:04:57)

Tar'ja takes the bag and waits for the droid to leave before looking inside and counting the sum. Her lekku twitch as she finishes the math "200 apiece as an advance...Somehow I get the feeling the full amount is not going to be a lot." She sighs and looks to the others "we have a grand total of thousand credits in this little bag." she says softly, it was never good to loudly announce matters of coin in a cantina.
She was already hoping to find something of value at the crash site that could be pawned off for a higher amount of credits, be it for herself or for that hyperdrive was yet to be determined in her mind, but life had taught her well when crash sites were involved.
She looks to Chase then to the ex-imperial "so then what will we do? try and find a speeder for this small sum, or return for that cart and animal?"

### **Yogi** (2009-05-26 15:03:26)

**The Melt Down Cafe**
Chase listened as the Droid spoke. When it was mentioned that several tons of equipment would need to be transported he eyebrows shot up. He gave Tar'ja's hand a slight squeeze and let go as he placed his elbows on the table. "...The ship was carrying acidic resistant compounds vital to some of the rebellions missions and more importantly a large stock pile of Bacta. I do not have to tell you of its importance many military and non-military personal alike are in desperate need of those medical supplies."
He simply nodded at the information. ***Bacta. That would be valuable to whoever finds it.***
Whan Tar'ja brought up the subject of pay the droid simply passed a small bag to Tar'ja' as it spoke. "If compensation is your concern then fear not the rebellion has many wealthy supporters. I do not have the authority to discus salary but." At this Chase looked to SBC. At the moment he wished it wasn;t a droid but a live being. Not only so he could read it's face when it said that but to get a read through the Force as well.
With a quick exchange of comm codes SBC addressed them one last time. "I would hope that our information of your group is correct and I wish I could be of further assistance." It paused slightly. "You will do fine. May the force be with you all." At this Chase looked from the droid to Derida with a look of amazement on his face. ***A droid saying that. This droid gets stranger moment by moment.*** Quickly the droid left the bar leaving the five of them to themselves.
Chase couldn't help but smile as the droid left. Now that had to act and quickly as the storm was coming soon. He looked at Tar'ja as she spoke. she was going through the bag left by the droid. He complaint about the money involved was not missed. But then again he had to remember credits is what drives some. He tucked that information into the back of his head for the time being
With looks to him and Deidra the scout posed a question. "So then what will we do? try and find a speeder for this small sum, or return for that cart and animal?"
Chase lookad around tha table. **"I don't think we can purchase a speeder for the sum that was given to us. Might be better to get the cart and beast at the farm and maybe even get another. From what it sounds like there is quite a bit out there that needs to be recovered. One animal and cart may not be enough. Finding another shouldn't be too hard as most corners, from what I've seen, seem to have someone selling one. So another cart and beast with some protective gear for us and we can get going. Slow going but going none the less. What do you all think about that?"** He looked and waited for reactions from the others.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-05-26 19:06:22)

Tar'ja nods her head and hums softly "That does seem the better plan, I think we can haggle for some good gear and a strong beast with this amount along with what little we each have." She looks to the others while she speaks.
It would be best if they could procure another beast to help with the load, even finding a second cart might be a fair idea though perhaps not possible. They would need gear though, weather appropriate clothing would greatly help them for this mission and more so to help care for any injured they may bring in.
"If we can get a good price it might do well to carry on the possibility of spare blankets at the least to protect any injured or living people we may find, as well as hide the goods when we bring them back."

Thinking back to his visit to the farm with Tar'ja, Kasga pipes up, **"The animals were already prepped for travel when we were out at the farm. The repulsors on that speeder still work. I'm not sure for how long. If I had a toolkit and some parts, I could repair it the propulsion system and the guidance array. I'd hate to leave it behind. I get the feeling we'll be needing the mobility. We're probably going to have to wait out the storm. Maybe we can get parts and travelling gear before it gets here. I can try to get the speeder fixed before the storm passes. If not, it could be towed behind the cart while I work on it."**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **ganthet** (2009-05-27 13:12:39)

Consideering that he was almost broke credits sounded good to Dexter. he would have to make a point to ask for his share later. "So I guess that part is done now comes the interesrting part. Figureing out how tofind what we are looking for." Dexter continues to scan the news to see if anything of interest has happened lately. "So what we going to do while we are waiting for the storm to pass? Staying here going to be an option?"Dexter started to think about ideas for finding what they where looking for. If he could get to a computer terminal that had the info he needed finding it could be a piec of spice cake, but that was a big if and that if could get them all killed. Not a pleasant thought. With that thought he finishes off his caf and asks for another.

**Mos Eisley: Melt Down CafÃ©** 
Naryen watched the news feed, in strained silence, as the conversation around her seems to drift. The report was devoid of any meaningful details, clinical and without any inflammation or rhetoric. This surprised her since she expected tight constraints on the media from the Empire. She starts to calm herself, realizing the need to, when she saw that the report had nothing of any value and likely a mistake for it to even have been released.
Dexters voice cut through the jumble of Naryens mind. "So what we going to do while we are waiting for the storm to pass? Staying here going to be an option?" Naryen looked up at Dexter then at Chase where her focus stayed. When she spoke her voice was calm and even, a sharp contrast to the distracted expression still lingering on her face. **â€I recommend we move now. We need to obtain another creature and cart set out at once.â€** She glances back to where SBC left then back. **â€œDroids are good at some things but not others, like conveying genuine urgency or emotion. SBC has said time and again that time is of the essence. My feeling is that time is, in fact, dangerously short, something that glorified recorder has not told us.â€** a flash of annoyance appears but is suppressed as Naryen glances around the table to each person once then back to Chase.
Her expression is now much more even and her tone has layers of urgency as she speaks. **â€My vote, if this is how we are deciding things, is that we move with the storm as cover and with all possible speed. We need gear for the storm and local beasts that favor storms.â€** She then looks to Kasga **â€If the speeder you mentioned is the same one I saw you riding I think, given the smoke, that itâ€™s beyond a few part and time and I doubt youâ€™ll be able to accomplish anything during a sandstorm. If we are to wait then your proposal is worth considering.â€**
She then looks to Tarâ€™ja, as she slides back her pad with the news report showing, her expression and tone is more focused, her eyes showing some intensity. **â€Since we know the Empire is interested we know we need to move quickly. If there are survivors their lives are certainly at risk.â€** The last 2 words carry an added emphasis that Tarâ€™ja should have no problem understanding as *â€dead without our helpâ€*.
She looks back to Chase **"With the resources of an Imperial Garrison and a supporting Star Destroyer likely still in place the storm is all the advantage we'll have."**. She nods once to indicate she is done and sits back looking around the table.

Chase listened as Dexter and Deidra talked. Waiting was an option like Dex mentioned but Deidra made several good arguments as to heading out now. Deidra looked back to him a look of seriousness and motivation in her eyes. "With the resources of an Imperial Garrison and a supporting Star Destroyer likely still in place the storm is all the advantage we'll have."
Chase nodded and brought his focus again to use the Force. Searching within himself to look for answers felt like a fleeting effort. A sense of urgency maybe. He just wasn't sure. For all he knew it could just be the danger of the approaching storm. He sighed as he looked back to Deidra. **"I agree. The storm will be our best chance to search unhindered by any Imperial forces. The sooner we get going the better. I have a feeling that if we don't go soon it will just get worse."** It wasn't a lie per say. Something was tugging at his through the Force. He just didn't know what it was due to the lack of training.
His posture was forward, elbows still on the table. **"A beast, cart and protective gear for the five of us. What we were given should cover that. Along with the beast and cart at the farm we should be ready to go. If we're going to get these things before the storm hit in full force we better get going."** Chase said the last word with a head tilt towards the door. **"We can't wait any longer."** He looked around the table his gaze falling on Tar'ja last. He gave her a smile.

Tar'ja nods her head as she listens to both humans speak though her eyes were on the news report for the moment. Looking up in time to see Chase's smile to her, she returns it with a small one of her own.
With a sigh she looks to the others "no sense waiting then, we seem to be decided in a majority that we need to move, though if you both-" she looks pointedly to Dex and Kasga "want to stay a time and rest here, I say feel free, though I do believe they're cut then should be far less then typical." Though she meant to use the credits promised to scare them into moving with the group, she really didn't mind simply not sharing the pot with them. In her book, if someone didn't pull their weight they got cut out of the deal.
Looking to Chase and Deidra she cheers slightly with a more relaxed air "well then, shall we all go shopping then? I seem to recall some women I...met in passing saying it was a good way to bond." she had paused in saying that she had met the women she spoke of, after all it was in passing they happened by where she was hiding and they were talking of shopping...that counted didn't it?

Kasga looks over at Deirdra perplexed, **"I didn't think that riding out in a sand storm was an option. I'm not especially good with planetside environments, so I don't know if we can travel without getting lost or scoured to bones. I sure wouldn't want to try and fix that speeder in a storm."**
Kasga shrugs getting up from his chair, **"I could fix the speeder under cover, but it would take time and parts. If we need to go now, the delay to find parts might be to much. The cart I saw when Tar'ja and I were at the farm seemed pretty big. Do you really think we need another one?"**

"...The cart I saw when Tar'ja and I were at the farm seemed pretty big. Do you really think we need another one?" Kasga said to them.
Chase remembered the cart. The children would use it to play around and on. It was good sized. During his time on the *Bloodhawk* they had filled up many carts like it. He nodded his head as he thought.
**"We probably don't to be honest. The cart is pretty good sized. We used to load up carts like that when I was on the *Bloodhawk.* We used to load them up. A few tons at least. It should get the job done for us. So all we need now is protective gear and a large tarp to cover the cargo from prying eyes. When we find the cargo where do we go. Can't come back to here. it'll be searched by the troopers. That leaves the farm but I'm reluctant to suggest it as it would place them in more danger. Any ideas?"**

**The Melt Down Cafe**
With the droid long gone and your group still working out the mission the cantina around you continues on much the same. The under aged teens have moved on, after nursing away what little credits they had in pocket. Gartug the local Gammorean pit fighter has awoken upset and thirsty for more spirits "ARRGGHHHHH! Gar need mor NOW!" in response fresh pictures are quickly brought to his table. The sabacc game winds down to an end with a saddened Seggen and Syan Teb frowning their way out of the cantina. The winner Tav Ab`loon walks after them a large grin on his muzzled face, in passing of a fellow Bothan the card shark politely nods.
The Trandosians are gone replaced with four Gran`s drinking heavily after a long haul and a longer awaited payday. The stage is now empty the repeating Cerean band replaced by the local media on the surrounding monitors. (The sound was turned off, and is now on) "Its TB-5599876 to the right ... no no its an intercepted by GT- 557734 ... fumble fumble I can`t believe it there`s is a mad scramble now .... YES! now TB-5599877 recovers and it`s a dash to the finish." Three teams of droids compete in a full contact sports game.
Smoke drifts through the cantina now as the Gran`s puff away on small pipes, laughing and pushing each other around as they play a casual game of dice. Your group continues to discuss the mission as the droid game is abruptly interrupted.
"We interrupt this broadcast to refresh you on current events in the Varlbrindal system." The picture changes to a ruined city scape bodies all over, smoldering buildings and equipment. "Rebel sympathizers have directly attacked an imperial world. Reports are coming in of traitors to the empire and the only lead is a lone assassin female Twi`lek." The image changes to that of Tar`ja with a small child in tow, Tar`ja turns rapidly and blasts the camera away. The screen flashes static then loops into a replay. "You can see the heartless assassin holding a small child like a shield. If you have any information on the where abouts of this individual contact your local imperial authorities. Repeat countless dead on Varlbrindal the empire has dispatched ships of the fleet in retaliation to this ongoing crisis of terrorism."
The broadcast picks up where it left off on the droid games. A few of the local patrons begin to whisper amongst themselves, as Tar`ja herself slinks ever closer to Chase both for comfort and cover.

Before anyone could respond to his question the Droid game that was on the broadcast was interrupted. Chase turned his head to look at the viewer. "We interrupt this broadcast to refresh you on current events in the Varlbrindal system." The picture changed to a ruined city scape bodies all over, smoldering buildings and equipment. chase couldn't believe his eves. It was what he had seen in the Force vision from Deidra and Tar'ja. He had the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. The broadcast continued.
"Rebel sympathizers have directly attacked an imperial world. Reports are coming in of traitors to the empire and the only lead is a lone assassin female Twi`lek."
As the image changed it showed Tar'ja and the little one. The feeling in his stomach turned into a rock. His hand found hers no matter where it was and held it tight.
The commentary continued "You can see the heartless assassin holding a small child like a shield. If you have any information on the where abouts of this individual contact your local imperial authorities. Repeat countless dead on Varlbrindal the empire has dispatched ships of the fleet in retaliation to this ongoing crisis of terrorism."
**"Karking hell!"** Chase said with his voice low. There was an urgency in his voice that wasn't there before. **"We gotta move and now."** He made the move to retrieve his hooded cloak. Grabbing it he handed it to Tar'ja. There was a look of urgency there.**"Put this on. Your coloring is while very alluring is *very* distinctive. Anyone who sees this broadcast will recognize it. And if they do We're all in for an interesting time."** 
He looked to the others. **"We gotta go."** Chase made sure his blaster was ready in it's holster and his lightsaber was in easy reach. Problem was if he needed his lightsaber they would already be in it too deep.

### **zerah** (2009-05-29 14:12:47)

Tar'ja glances to the screens as the broadcast starts. Her eyes widen at the images of her, that damned droid thing had recorded and they were saying she was using her little one as a shield???
Sinking down into the booth and closer to Chase she mutters under her breath. It was a welcome comfort to feel Chase's hand in hers. "We gotta move and now." Chase said and she couldn't agree more, the cloak that was passed to her was quickly tied around her shoulders with the hood up. Her hand moves to her blaster to check it's still there while she speaks "how dare they ever think I would use that little one as a shield; bastards, the whole lot of them." A glance to the ex-imperial "..No offense."
Now that the cloak was on she follows Chase to get out of the booth "suppose this settles the debate on if we're leaving now or later."

Catching the announcement without turning around, Kasga pauses. Keeping his voice low, Kasga growls, **"Nothing like having the options eliminated. Yeah, we need to go. Let's see if we can pick some travelling gear on our way out."**

**Mos Eisley: Melt Down CafÃ©** 
"We interrupt this broadcast to refresh you on current events in the Varlbrindal system." The name of her home world cut through her mind, the mental equivalent of a stinging slap across her face. She shivered slightly with the intensity of her focus as her senses zeroed in on the news brief. Her face blanked and the hardness in her eyes rivaled the diamonds that glisten from the Varlbrindal southern mountains in their summer. Even though the stage was well within her field of vision, she turned, slowly, to give her focus bearing. The sight of corpses, of both people and buildings now robbed of life after being violated and burned empty, flooded Naryens mind with memories of the massacre and her sense of powerlessness which starts to fight and take hold of her again. Her mind starts striking back against the overwhelming fear with cold lances of precision.
â€œRebel sympathizers have directly attacked an imperial world.â€ ***And the great Imperial forces were without power to stop it?*** â€œReports are coming in of traitors to the empire and the only lead is a lone assassin female Twi`lek." ***And thatâ€™s all that Imperial Intelligence could get?***
She watched the replay that she herself had arranged at the communications & control hub. Itâ€™s presence mocking her and how easy, it seemed, she was manipulated by the promises of the now Emperor Palpatine. Rage colored her eyes now, harsh, cold and piercing in its intensity. Possiblities slide into place and she finds she has a mission of her own to complete and SBC will play the tool of opportunity, much as she was for the Emperor. ***No longer.***
"You can see the heartless assassin holding a small child like a shield.â€ A flicker of a different emotion colors her eyes, for an instant, as Naryen recalls how she considered the same possibility herself. Even though it was one of many the sting is not lessened, but the moment passes almost like it was never there. â€œIf you have any information on the whereabouts of this individual contact your local Imperial authorities.â€ ***Iâ€™m sure an award will be offered at some point.*** â€œThe Empire has dispatched ships of the fleet in retaliation to this ongoing crisis of terrorism." ***And the stranglehold on the citizens of the galaxy gets tighter.***
"Karking hell!" she hears from Chase, as she calmly and slowly checks her gear and attire. Whispers drift from the other patrons, not clear from her distance but she could guess at their content. ***â€Rebel sympathizers killed all those people? How awful! Well Iâ€™m not one of them I can tell you! Shamefulâ€¦ I wonder if theyâ€™ll offer a reward soon!â€*** Naryen watches Chase and Tarâ€™ja as they interact then Chase declares "We gotta go." And from Tarâ€™ja, she hears "â€¦bastards, the whole lot of them." Then she glances up to Naryen. "..No offense."
The banter from the rest, as they ready to leave, supports her earlier suggestion, though she wishes it was different. Naryen pitches her voice for just the group ***â€Dexter and Kasga, wait with meâ€*** a glance to each as their names are invoked, ***â€Chase and Tarâ€™ja get out the side doors now. Weâ€™ll count 20 seconds after youâ€™re out the door and leave out the front. Meet at the head of the alley. If we get separated meet at the cart back at Dossanas farm. Com-silent! Go!â€***
Her tone invites no discussion. No argument. She simply sits there.

"Nothing like having the options eliminated. Yeah, we need to go. Let's see if we can pick some travelling gear on our way out." That was from Kasga. Chase nodded once. His once actions carefree demeanor was now set aside. He Jedi training began to take over. He was calm, surprisingly and ready to go.
Still holding Tar'ja's hand he began to move. He looked at Deidra as she spoke to the two of them. â€Chase and Tarâ€™ja get out the side doors now. Weâ€™ll count 20 seconds after youâ€™re out the door and leave out the front. Meet at the head of the alley. If we get separated meet at the cart back at Dossanas farm. Com-silent! Go!â€ A simple nod was all he gave her as he leaned in close to Tar'ja and whispered. **"Keep your hands under wraps. The less they see the better."**
He stood, turned and reached for her arm an act of helping one up. When she was up next to him he put his left arm around and began to walk towards the side door as if nothing was happening. Being close to her again was bringing back the thoughts and emotions of the store room. He smiled slightly as he pushed them farther back into his mind. He gave her what he hoped was a comforting squeeze with his arm as they walked. The cloak didn't do much to hide the contours of her body. He spoke softly so only she could hear. **"I wanted to get some time alone with you but this wasn't what I had in mind."** He looked to the door. **"If anyone other than the others call out to us just keep moving to the door. I'll make sure you get out."** He was calm and reassuring as he spoke.
He kept an look out for any trouble. He opened himself up to the Force hoping that it would alert him of any trouble. They were gong to need all the help they could get. The door was before them and he reached out to open it....
OOC: Tru I hope I didn't go to far. I was going to say they got out to the alley but I wasn't sure if they would be noticed by anyone.
I have to say though my first Force power is going to be Mind Trick.

Tar'ja stood with the help of Chase, briefly allowing herself to enjoy the feeling of his arm around her and as such, moved close to him, nearly leaning on him as they walk. It was a new experience, she hadn't had people actually worry over her in a long time.
"I wanted to get some time alone with you but this wasn't what I had in mind." That made her smile under the cloak, responding with a whisper of her own "while I wouldn't have minded, and this isn't the best way to have that alone time, I can't say I mind how things are going." she laughs lightly, softly, keeping her head forward and slightly down to shade her face.
As he reaches the door she hopes they'll be able to get past any others that they may come across, though..."I wonder how much they'll offer for information on me." she couldn't help to mumble that out loud, really now the more they offer the more of a threat they think you are.

### **Yogi** (2009-05-29 17:59:15)

"...I can't say I mind how things are going." Chase felt her body move from her slight laugh more than he heard it. He noticed that she was keeping her head down. *Good Tar'ja try to act inconspicuous. They don't see you for who you really are.* Those words surprised him as well. For no one has seen him for who he really was in a long time. Except for Deidra who was an Imperial at that.
He heard her speak again as he reached for the door. "I wonder how much they'll offer for information on me." He heard her mumble. He gave a slight shrug. **"I don't know but I don't think one can put a price on you."** He stopped speaking quickly. He looked at her quickly if she saw his face she would have noticed a slight shade of red on his cheeks. He hadn't really meant to say that out loud. **"Come on Chase keep your focus."** He said as he quietly berated himself. *Talk about laying all your sabacc cards on the table.* He pushed the thoughts for a second time to the back of his head as he kept his Force awareness open for any trouble.

Tar'ja smiles genuinely, tilting her head enough to see him "you are quite the charmer you know...I like it." she leans into him again, letting her head rest on his shoulder for a moment, for that brief moment enjoying it, imagining what it would have been like if the situation was different, not having to run quickly and get out before someone recognized her.
"I like it a lot." she says softly.

Naryen sat there with a calm slightly smiling expression on her face, her hands folded in front of her, and her shoulders relaxed. She broadly smiles and nods back at Chase as the pair leaves the booth.
She looks back and forth at Dexter and Kasga trying to appear engaged in conversation with them as Chase and Tarâ€™ja left out the side door. ***Perhaps 20seconds is too longâ€¦ canâ€™t be helped now.* â€œSo did either of you see a dealer in Merchants row that displayed deep desert wear or pack animals? Oh and Dexter, can you pull up that work-up of that ship we were looking at earlier please? Iâ€™d like to look at it again.â€** Her tone is conversational, pitched just for the booth but it cools as she says **â€Weâ€™re leaving in 15.â€** Then changes back to conversational pleasantness as she looks to Dexter and asks **â€How well do you know Tav Ab`loon?â€** but her voice takes a certain edge that should get Dexters attention as *â€œwe may have a problemâ€.*
She looks out at the front door, all nice and casual like, then back to her associates.

"Give me back my Data pad and I will give you the info you want." Dexter getts up and starts to follow the group he was supposed to follow. "I have a cart and Bantha back at the farm. If that maybe of use." Dexter checks to make sure his blaster is handy. He dials though his memory looking for the name he was asked about. *"Hmm. That might be a new one to me. Have to check into it."* He continues to think of the person he was supposed to know.

**The Melt Down Cafe**
With some of your group suddenly getting up to leave you notice a more then a few heads turn. Some go back to their business not in the least concerned others like the table of Gran`s watch your tables movements. As Chase and Tar`ja pass the ran`s table they notice one hide a small data pad rather quickly. Unfortunately his movements where fast enough to hide the data pads contents.
Each Gran has a drink which has barely been touched, they have cards over the table each holding a hand of random numbers. The closest Gran as you pass is wearing fine silks of various colors, you notice he is armed with a heavy blaster pistol, the next is unkempt wearing mix match clothes smiling conterminously this Gran is armed with a blaster rifle. The Gram opposite the first has a crooked snout worn clothing an a large vibro blade on his back, beside him the last Gran is simply dressed but neat as he rubs his ear you can see twin sporting pistols at his sides.
Not wanting to stick around and following Deidra`s Chase and Tar`ja continue towards the side door. At the table Deidra Dexter and Kasga watch and count down for their turn to leave. Chase and Tar`ja make it to the side door with minimal attention from the local patrons but the Gran table seems to be focused on your private booth.
After a few nods to each other two of the Gran`s stand and move towards your booth. Chase reaches out for the side door and for the force at the same time turning the handle. The neatly dressed Gran aprouches flanked by the crooked snout Gran. They stop at the entrance to the booth where they both do a double take on their data pad while looking at your group.
Seeing this causes Chase to pause in his tracks, in the shelter of his arm Tar`ja is forced to halt as well. You both notice the other two Gran have focused their attention on your casual retreat from the cantina.
The lead Gran dressed neatly with twin blaster pistols is the first to breck the silence. Pointing at Dexter first then Kasga "You are Dexter we have a warrant for your arrest if you would come with us for questioning." Looking to Kasga "Your name is not on file but you meet the description of another bounty within our files. We must insist you both follow us." As if to emphasize his partners statement the crooked snout Gran fingers the vibro blade hanging on his back while stretching the fingers of his other hand.

Dexter looks at the Gran and his friends."My good sir. I have no idea what you are talking about I don't know this Dexter you are referring to. Now please me and my friends have bussiness we need to be dealing with. So if you would excuss us." Dexter hopes that they will buy the his story and will leave them alone.
He keeps his attention on the gran looking for any sign that his story had worked.

Chase noticed the table of Grans as he and Tar'ja walked past. The quick hiding of a datapad and the barely touched drinks did not go unnoticed by the human. He also noticed the hardware they were carrying. As he reached for the door to open it for Tar'ja he reached out with the Force for any subtle hints of trouble. He didn't detect any but then again he wasn't fully trained either.
Looking back he noticed that two of the grans had moved to the booths entrance. Chase stopped at the door which also stopped Tar'ja from moving. He looked back to the other two still at the table and he saw that they were being watched as they were leaving. ***probably wondering what our relationship is to the others I imaging. This is not going to be good.*** He didn't have to wait long to find out what was going on as the lead Gran at the table spoke.
"You are Dexter we have a warrant for your arrest if you would come with us for questioning." Chase didn't take his eyes off the two looking at them as the Gran continued. "Your name is not on file but you meet the description of another bounty within our files. We must insist you both follow us."
Chase cocked his head. ***Bounty hunters, just what we needed.*** Chase looked back to Tar'ja and leaned in close. **"Bounty hunters it looks like. Be ready to go out the door if needed. We can't have them see you."** He removed his arm from the beautiful Twi'lek and took a step back and faced the two at the table. **"Is what I heard true? Is there a bounty on two of them? Which ones? Now I'm glad we decided to leave."** Chase kept his posture neutral but let a slight distaste enter his tone when speaking about the others.

*Trying to look at everything all the time means that you will see less than half of everything you look at if you are lucky. Lucky gets you killed.* or so her Tactics instructor was fond of saying. The passionate arguments they had had added a flare the course seemed to have lacked and the frustrating exchanges left her flushed with excitement afterwards and left her anticipating their next exchange. Naryen now wonders, looking at a group of Gran mercenaries, if part of that had to do with her instructorsâ€™ infiltration background and her not getting some of the underlying messages.
Naryen, while trying to keep an even expression, takes in as much details as she can as she contemplates yet another in her impressively long list of failures. ***Weâ€™ve moved to soon and too quickly it seems. I was hoping our remaining at the table would have divided attentionâ€¦***  Her suspicions are confirmed as two of them stand and move towards the booth where the three of them sit discussing their business. ***â€¦ it seems not to have worked.***
A neatly dressed Gran, carrying twin sporting pistols at his sides, flanked by another Gran, with a crooked snout & dressed in worn clothing displaying large vibro-blade on his back, step up to the entrance of the booth. After reviewing his pad Twiny points at Dexter and says "You are Dexter we have a warrant for your arrest if you would come with us for questioning." He then pointes to Kasga "Your name is not on file but you meet the description of another bounty within our files. We must insist you both follow us." Naryen sits the same as she was, hands folded in front of her as she looks at the Gran, she just considers her response when she noticed Bendy rubbing his weapon. ***Iâ€™m wondering if the warrant specifies what condition they are permitted to be in.***
Her time at Dosannas farm allowed her access to a wide range of documents including some examples of fiscal constraints imposed by Imperial doctrines. Looking at the Mercenaries it occurred to her the wonderfully twisted logic and it made her stomach twist in anger. ***Impose restrictive laws and then provide job opportunities for the criminals. Wonderful.*** She becomes acutely aware of how poorly laid out her clothing is, realizing her pistol is out of the question though her bag to the side is providing easy access to her baton, should things go sour.
Her anger gives her focus and she, already in her military pose, looks at Twiny face and pitches her voice cold and *â€œyouâ€™ve stepped out of line soldier and my rapidly diminishing patience is all thatâ€™s keeping you aliveâ€* **â€Iâ€™m discussing business with these gentlemen and I donâ€™t appreciate being interrupted.â€** the weight given to the â€œdonâ€™tâ€ included some display of teeth and a slight hissing accompanied by some pronounced jaw tension. She then looks at Twinysâ€™ pad. **â€œHowever I am always looking for opportunities.â€** her voice purrs somewhat, a distinct contrast intended to keep them off balance **â€œShow me the warrants.â€** She casually extends her hand to Twinysâ€™ pad though her voice is now back to the â€œdonâ€™t argue with meâ€ tone. If Twiny delays in handing over the pad she will sigh and in a more reasonable tone say **â€œI really am pressed for time here. If you want to discuss a counter proposal sit with us and Iâ€™m sure I can accommodate you gentleman.â€** indicating that she is giving ground.

Tar'ja pauses at the door when Chase does, the feel of eyes on them hadn't escaped her but she was doing her best to ignore them. Seems though that things were getting tougher now as time was going on.
"Bounty hunters it looks like. Be ready to go out the door if needed. We can't have them see you." He had said into her ear, great..just perfect. Exactly what they needed, well it seemed at least at some point in their lives those two had managed to do something right in getting into the system.
Keeping her head down, she stays by the door as Chase moves in front of her to speak to the hunters. *Let's think this out…if they try and take those two, Deidra will probably have to stop them, which will bring in Chase, and we just really have trouble missing firefights…though…if we get into a firefight then those still in this bar will see me and we'll have even more trouble.* Glancing slightly to the side she looks to the walls, wondering if there was enough shadow to hide in and take them out.

The Crooked snouted Gran points at Kasga with an outstretched hand "See the scar its the same one same placement, its him alright." The lead Gran nods but maintains focus on your group.
"Yea this is the guy, we will round them both up." The lead Gran smiles and rubs his ear again as Dexter makes his plea at innocents (no force point needed your roll was too low man).
At the table Chase closes the distance a step towards the Grans companions who casually move their hands closer to their weapons. The Gran in silks maintains eye contact with Chase as the smiling Gran focuses on the back door on Tar`ja. At Chase`s Questioning the Gran`s at the table only shrug their shoulders declining to answer the question at all.
When Deidra makes her statement regarding business the lead Gran nodes rubs his ear and smiles. "I too am a business man, of sorts. I am not sure what you propose but I have my doubts that you could match or even beat Grumbo`s price on these two. The crooked snouted Gran begins to focus more on Kasga, while moving a hand to the hilt of his vibro blade. (Force point used Deidra)
Tar`ja looks around for cover not though the cantina is shrouded in smoke there are few shadows. A few obvious possibilities would be the other booths or to exit through the side door and come around the front.
The lead Gran takes a seat as offered, rubbing his ear the Gran casually states. "I would not be much of a business man if I did not at least hear you out."

Naryen watches the intentionally provoking behaviour of Bendy as he points at Kasga "See the scar its the same one same placement, its him alright." Twiny nods in acknowledgment of his partner while showing undisturbed focus ***Detailed descriptions. This isnâ€™t good at all.*** and answers with "Yea this is the guy, we will round them both up." His response to Dexters plea is a smile. ***Iâ€™m not sure if I like that smile.***
Twiny nods, seemingly conceding Naryens point, rubs his ear ***Nervous tick?*** and smiles again. ***No, I donâ€™t like that smile.*** "I too am a business man, of sorts. I am not sure what you propose but I have my doubts that you could match or even beat Grumbo`s price on these two.â€ ***Grumbo is it?*** Naryen makes no display of hiding her genuine expression of inquisitive confusion and looks, briefly, to Dexter and Kasga to see if they find the name familiar. ***Great! What did these two do?***
Naryen smiles and nods to Twiny and returns her extended hand to fold with its mate on the table. **â€œNow lets not be hasty.

We're all good business beings here.*** Her expression changes to one of irritation as she continues. **â€And the increased Imperial scrutiny has been a real hassle.â€** The end of her statement sits right in the area of frustration and she looks to gauge Twiny and Bendys reactions.
She shrugs and smiles again. **â€But thatâ€™s the nature of business and one needs to be flexible.â€** the smile changes to something nearly feral **â€and Iâ€™m flexible.â€** She glances to Bendy and offers him a wink and a smirk before she looks back to Twiny. **â€Iâ€™m confident we can arrange something but Iâ€™ll want to see their warrants."** She glances at Dexter and Kasga and the look she gives them should make them feel uncomfortable. **"I'm sure you'll agree that's that's not an unreasonable request.â€** She lets a little "doe-eye" filter into her expression with her chin down slightly and fixing Twiny with a look that says Naryen is thinking a little dirty.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Meltdown Cafe**</span>
Chase stood there as the Two Gran's simply looked at him as he spoke. One thing he did not miss was their hands moving closer to their weapons. The fancy dressed on was watching him. Looking at the other he saw the alien looking behind him at Tar'ja. Neither Gran answered his question. All he got for his effort was a pair of shrugs. ***Great we're now effectively split up again. We're going to have to go out the side and wait around to see what happens.***
Chase gave his own shrug and waved a dismissive hand at the table. **"Figures can't trust anyone these days without something going on."** Chase turned and walked towards Tar'ja. **"Lets go honey. Best to get undercover before the storm hit full force.** When he reached her he slipped his arm around her again. He looked back at the table not sure if Deidra would see him. **"Good riddance"** he said just loud enough for the Grans to hear. He hoped that he was believable that he had no friendly overtones for the three at the table.
He reached out with the Force to Deidra. Master Garet had taught him how to reach out to people. It was a way to make them feel comforted. To know that they weren't alone. Chase sent feelings of being protected, and watched to the former Imperial. He kept himself open to the Force so he could try and gauge the feelings of Deidra and the others left in the Cafe. Hopefully he would pick up on something if it went wrong.
He bent close to Tar'ja again as he lead her out the door **"Any ideas? I'm thinking we wait outside, see what happens. If they take 'em their as good as dead."** He said softly for Tar'ja to hear.
Being open to the Force and being so close to Tar'ja he was having a hard time filtering out what was coming off of the beautiful Twi'lek that he held in his arm and what he was trying to get from inside. It was a little obvious that his focus was a bit divided though he felt that he was getting better at acting normal when using the Force.

There were those eyes again, was it really possible to feel a hole being burned into someone? Didn't that thing ever blink?
"Lets go honey..." she couldn't help the slight start at the words and the arm that was put around her, looking up to him quickly as she forced herself to simply take up leaning against him again, "..Best to get undercover before the storm hit full force." She nods her head and curls into him, glancing over his shoulder slightly to the others. "Good riddance" He said, odd that even knowing at playing that they didn't know the others she felt an odd sense of guilt at leaving the ex-imperial, maybe she was starting to grow slightly attached to the woman....or maybe she was just tired, yes, probably just tired.
His arm and hand around and on her was making her warm, she knew she was blushing and thanking everything in the sky for the cloak on her to cover the fact. Did he know how much he was effecting her? that she had been thinking about him since they had parted? how nice..and right it seemed to be in this position with him.
"Any ideas?" Right, she needed to focus on what was going on! what was going on again? "I'm thinking we wait outside, see what happens. If they take 'em their as good as dead." Right, of course! what was wrong with her? she'd never been this unfocused in years...
Leaning close to him she whispers in his ear while making light movements of subtle nuzzling against his cheek "It might be best to wait outside..if they do take them, we can ambush them."

OOC: Tru I guessing that the two grans let him go as they didn't seem to interested in him.
IC:
Chase with his arm around Tar'ja reached for the door. He would have sworn that it had gotten warmer but when he looked down and saw the eyes hidden beneath the hood he knew the reason. He simply liked being close to her. No there was more to it than that. To say it was merely a liking would be a understatement.
Opening the door he wasn't getting anything alarming at the moment from behind him which he figured was a good thing. He then picked up on a feeling of comfort. Of something that was...more than a liking? He looked at Tar'ja and realized it was coming from her. In an effort to get some sort of focus back he asked her a question. There was another but that one would have to wait till another time.
It almost seemed that she had trouble answering him. As if her mind was somewhere else. She leaned in close, her body up against his and whispered in his ear as they stepped outside. "It might be best to wait outside..if they do take them, we can ambush them." He nodded as the door close behind them. It was then he realized she was nuzzling lightly against his cheek. Two breathless words escaped his lips. **"That's…nice."** His arm held her a bit tighter as his breath was felt along her neck.
He exhaled again as the Force was flowing through him but he didn't move **"Yeah, ambush, good idea."** He paused for a second coming to grips with himself. **"I need to focus. If I don't I won't be able to tell if the poodoo hit the fan in there."** He slipped. As soon as he said it he knew it. A question might be asked and he knew he wouldn't lie to her when she did.

*"Well I thought that the one was behind the fool must have lived through the bombing.

On top of it his back up seemed to be walking out on him well at least one of his friends was still there. "Gentlemen there is no need of weapons here I mean you no harm. we can allbe friends here the strom is coming why can't we be civil about this." Dexter smiles and has his hands out infront of him without moving them anywhere near his blaster. "So what has old Grumbo offered for my hide? Last time I saw him his place was getting bombed into little pieces by the Empire. How is he going to pay you? Suerly he has to rebuild his bussiness so he can't have alot of credits setting around to spend on Bounty hunters such as yourselves."

Her mind was many miles away with the sensation of his breath on his neck was he feeling this as well? this..this feeling of connection? this want to be near, want to be close, what was it again? liking someone...more than liking, did she dare ever though use the word she thought of? "That's...nice." His words were breathless, maybe..he did feel the same.
With his arm holding her tighter she had no where else to move but closer to him, tilting her head up to turn pale blue hues on him, search his eyes. Deep down she kept telling herself there were so many better places then this to be having these thoughts and more so the discussions that were bound to happen, but seemed this was the time and place they would take place regardless.
"I need to focus. If I don't I won't be able to tell if the poodoo hit the fan in there." Tar'ja had to smile at that, that rare genuine smile that seemed to be reserved for him as of late, strange they would have the same thoughts...though for the moment she couldn't bring herself to care.
"And what is it that has you so out of focus hm...?" *Is it the same as me?*

As he pulled her closer she gave no resistance. She looked up at him and he looked into her pale blue eyes. They were as beautiful as the rest of her. They were the first thing he really noticed about her. ***Does she feel the same? Could she feel the same?*** This wasn't the place to do this and he knew it. But being so close to her, a bantha hair wouldn't have been able to get between them, it didn't seem like it mattered. In the back of his mind though it did. The others would be counting on them to pull their butts out of the fire with the bounty hunters.
He told her that he need to to focus. She gave him the smile that he has seen only a couple of times. It was as if she only used it for him. He found himself smiling back at her as his other arm moved up and completed the embrace. It wasn't like the one in the closet earlier. The was a look in his eyes this time. One of wanting or maybe a need but then the need of the others flashed again. There was still no warning from the Force but it had only been a matter of seconds since they had walked out the door.
What focus he had gained back was almost gone again when she spoke. "And what is it that has you so out of focus hm...?" Chase would have sworn that she managed to get closer to him. He would have bet all he had on it. Face to face, centimeters apart he looked at her. It was her that had him so unfocused. This hadn't happened to him before. Not like this. Master Garet would have had words for him right now.
**"It's you Tar'ja. You are what has me so unfocused. When I'm near you like this I want to say to hell with the whatever is going on and just stay like this with you."** He looked into her eyes again. If things were gong to become more involved between them he was going to have to tell her sooner or later. **"Despite what I want to focus on right here, right now.** With both arms he held her a bit tighter as if to emphasize his point. **"I need to be focused on what's happening in there. It sounds odd I know but I might be able to tell when things go bad before they do. It will be the one edge we have right now.** Is this what it feels like to care for someone? Maybe even...

The more he kept pulling her closer to him the more she was starting to blush, and wonder if it wasn't the dessert air that was making this feeling of heat. Was this then what the old family had been trying to explain? She had been far too young for any such talks of feelings for boys and what it can do but still they had tried, this...this must be what it was right?
She could feel his breath on her face when he spoke, his arm completing the circle around her while her own hands moved to encircle his neck; "It's you Tar'ja. You are what has me so unfocused. When I'm near you like this I want to say to hell with the whatever is going on and just stay like this with you." her eyes had widened slightly, he did feel the same then. She smiled at him again, he felt the same as her.
"Despite what I want to focus on right here, right now." He hugged her tighter making that stubborn blush return full force after just trying to keep it in check. "I need to be focused on what's happening in there. It sounds odd I know but I might be able to tell when things go bad before they do. It will be the one edge we have right now." She nods her head, as the thought of their friends...well...friend and two nuisances that can't seem to keep out of trouble.
"We, need to focus. You're right." She looks to the door that was only just behind them "Maybe then we should continue this later, when we are all safe and sound." She looks to him again, her heart giving an odd sort of leap she hadn't felt before. "And, I feel the same as you do." A faint pink returns to her cheeks at her words, she was going to say something more but then part of what he had said came back to her, how could he know when things would go bad from out here just by being focused?
She frowns slightly and looks to him with calculating eyes "what did you mean by might be able to tell when things go bad before they go bad? How could you know that without seeing or hearing them?"

Chase's own smiling and blushing was keeping pace with Tar'ja's. With her arms around his neck it would be easy to just lean forward and kiss her. What he felt inside was begging him to do it. But he fought it and spoke of being focused because. If he didn't he may not notice the subtle changes of emotion's from inside the Cafe. He wondered if she would pick up on what he said. ***She's smart and quick she'll pick up on it.*** He thought.
He saw her nod her head in agreement. "We, need to focus. You're right." He watched her look back to the door. "Maybe then we should continue this later, when we are all safe and sound." She looked at him again and that wanting to kiss her came back again. "And, I feel the same as you do." He didn't need the Force to see that she had meant it. He could see it in her pale blue eyes. He saw the blush rise up in her cheeks again as he felt the warmth in his.
She then frowned he eyes became calculating. He felt a shift in her emotions though she did not move away from him. He knew what the next question was going to be. He knew he shouldn't be but he almost dreaded to answer it. "What did you mean by might be able to tell when things go bad before they go bad? How could you know that without seeing or hearing them?"
Chase took a breath and looked at the door then back to her. He motioned with his head to move away from the door. About ten feet form the side door. Chase stopped near the wall. He held her hand in his. Just that simple touch of her hand would have been enough to keep him warm on a chilly night. He looked into her eyes, this wasn't going to be easy and it showed in his eyes.
**"Remember inside before we split up you said that maybe you would tell me a story and I said I would tell you mine?"** He saw her nod, unsure of what he was gong to say. **"Eight months ago my Master died."** When he said it he knew he started wrong and tried to correct it when he saw the look in her eyes. He lowered his voice for her. **"No not a master like that. He was a Jedi master."** He sighed as his thoughts ran back to the times they had shared and the lessons he had taught him. **"He found me on Corellia three years ago. That was when my training began to become a Jedi."** He was speaking quickly with an urgency in his voice. Just hoping that she would understand and accept what he was saying. **"If I focus I can pick up on changes in people emotions. The stronger the emotions the easier it it to sense. If it goes bad in there all the occupants emotions will skyrocket. I should be able to sense it.** He looked to the wall, he still didn't fell anything out of the ordinary. **"Like I said before I know it sounds hokey. But the Force lead me here to yo all. The fact that I met you and have begun to feel this way about you can't be a coincidence. From what I've learned there is no such thing as a coincidence."**
He continued to look at her the emotion that was in his eyes earlier was still there. But now he had exposed his biggest secret to her. He wasn't sure if she knew anything about Jedi. If she did, he could only imaging what it was.

"Remember inside before we split up you said that maybe you would tell me a story and I said I would tell you mine?" Tar'ja nodded her head, she still had to think of someway to tell her story to him, strange that one wants to hear a story that one would rather forget.
"Eight months ago my Master died." Master??? He was a slave? a human slave?? Her eyes widened she wanted to speak about finding this pigs grave and spitting on it, but he must have seen that in her eyes for his words were quick after "No not a master like that. He was a Jedi master." "Jedi..?" she all but whispered that word, looking at him as though he was from another planet...well...nevermind he was still talking.
"He found me on Corellia three years ago. That was when my training began to become a Jedi..." *Jedi…he..he is a Jedi?* "Force lead me here to yo all..." *Force? so that thing really existed?* "The fact that I met you and have begun to feel this way about you can't be a coincidence. From what I've learned there is no such thing as a coincidence." Well that part she did agree with, coincidence could get you killed.
Her thoughts were everywhere, stories from the family about the evils of Jedi, stories from other children that she was to observe to practice her stealth idolizing them as heroes, she had begun to think they were simply myth, but..."you're...a Jedi?" She said softly, half of her still in check was aware that this was serious and needed to be kept quiet "I thought Jedi were myths..." She looks him over slowly before looking again to his eyes confused "you don't look like you could trick someone with a simple gaze..I know you aren't evil so far...but..you aren't twenty feet tall and I don't think you could wave your hand and rid the world of ill will."
She frowns as one consistent thing did come back to her "but the glow sword...I've never seen you with one, isn't that what shows one is Jedi?" She hadn't stepped away, hadn't moved really save her head, she wouldn't either. She had stopped believing her family long ago, and had never really listened to the stories of the children, so she was fairly free to make her own mind on this "are..you truly jedi?"

Chase watched her as he spoke. He could see the changes in her thoughts and feel the slight confusion with her emotions. He wasn't sure if he was getting better at reading emotions or if it was the simple fact that his own connection with the Twi'lek was making it easier.
"Jedi..?" he heard her whisper as he kept talking. He saw her nodding her head slightly when he spoke of coincidence. He hoped she could understand. His ability with the Force was a part of him. Something he would never want to be without now that he knew about it. But as he looked at Tar'ja he wondered what he would do if she rejected it, or he was lying? He took a breath. It didn't matter now It was out there. She would have to accept him for who he is just as he was ready to accept her.
"You're...a Jedi?" She said again softly.
Chase nodded slightly as he brought up his other hand to hold her other one as she continued. "I thought Jedi were myths..." He watched her look him over slowly. She looked into his eyes again and he could see as well as feel the confusion that was behind them. "You don't look like you could trick someone with a simple gaze..I know you aren't evil so far...but..you aren't twenty feet tall and I don't think you could wave your hand and rid the world of ill will."
He smiled at that. Not a condescending smile but a true smile that he had given her before. **"Evil no. Twenty feet tall, no. Tricking someone with a gaze…well ask Deidra about our run in with the troopers we had a little bit ago but Dexter doesn't know yet. But I imaging before long the whole group will know."**
He saw her frown as she must have thought of something. "But the glow sword...I've never seen you with one, isn't that what shows one is Jedi?" She hadn't moved away. Chase hoped that this was a good sign. He nodded at the question. **Yes I have one. And *believe* me if things would have progressed here in this alleyway between us you would have found it."** Chase realizing he implication he was inferring couldn't stop the blush that entered his cheeks.
She looked at him searching his eyes. "Are..you truly Jedi?" Chase nodded again. **"Yes, but not fully trained. Before the Empire someone my age would have been training since they were a little child. I have a lot of catching up to do."** Holding both of her hands he stepped a bit closer. **"Believe me I would like nothing more than to continue that embrace we just shared but I would be focused completely on you and not in there."** He indicated with his head the Cafe. He eyes searched hers. **"I'm sorry. I now this is a lot to take in."**
As he waited for her to respond he reached out with the Force to the others inside the Cafe.

"Evil no. Twenty feet tall, no. Tricking someone with a gaze...well ask Deidra about our run in with the troopers we had a little bit ago but Dexter doesn't know yet. But I imaging before long the whole group will know." He said with a smile, she liked that smile, yes she really did like that smile.
*So, at least that part of the stories then are true..* Her thoughts return to him when he spoke of the glow sword..was that really what it was called? not a very fearsome name..."Yes I have one. And believe me if things would have progressed here in this alleyway between us you would have found it." She blushes just as he does with the implications of that simple sentence. She had to wonder, did he realize what he said before or after he said it.
He took her hands after that, mentioning again the need for concentration and she had to agree, they needed to concentrate. She nods her head and smiles to him "You're right, we can talk more about this later...more so after I've done some reading of what's available." She chuckles faintly at the prospect of doing homework like her little one would be doing now.
"It is a lot to take in yes, but of all the things that I have learned through the years with the family and on my own, it is that one should simply accept what can be and ignore what can't be. I can accept this." She looks to the door and nods to it "do you sense anything?"

Still talking quietly they stood there holding hands as he laid it all out for her. Thankfully he saw understanding in her eyes. "It is a lot to take in yes, but of all the things that I have learned through the years with the family and on my own, it is that one should simply accept what can be and ignore what can't be. I can accept this." He smiled and nodded as he let go a sigh of relief. "Do you sense anything?"
He shook his head. "No." He was still speaking softly. **"Nothing from in there and I've been trying since before we left. But I've been a bit preoccupied, with good reason."** He gave her the half smile he was used to giving. He was trying to get her to smile as it was one of the most beautiful smiles he had seen. **"Keep watch behind me, I'll watch behind you and on the inside."**
He quietly continued talking as he left himself open to the Force. It was good practice to do the two together. **"If it does go bad in there what do you want to do? Stay out here or try and help out in side and risk exposure? If I use my lightsaber all eyes will be on me and it might allow you some freedom to move.

**The Melt Down Cafe**
The lead Gran sits rubbing his left ear as he listens to Deidra`s proposal. Staring intently into Deidra`s eyes as she talks. For a few moments the Gran considers Deidra`s words.
Kasga sit watching the whole interaction, as the Duros feels the weight of his loaded blaster the crooked nose Gran stands watching with on hand on the hilt of his vibro blade.
Everyone in your group suddenly gets a feeling of comfort. The feeling is short but obvious. Each of you remember something comforting from you past. Kasga sitting on fathers lap learning at an early age how to fly the Juupar 3. Chase of the day he meet Garet for the first time, thinking back on it it seemed so natural so rehearsed. Tar`ja running through the family court yard excited about a new toy and tripping over her still growing legs. Deidra in the imperial headquarters on Corusant receiving her officer promotion. Dexter back on Bothawui in training under his mentors tutelage. You all feel a sense of warmth and comfort.
Both Chase and Tar`ja set off for the side exit, as the two Gran at the table continue to watch their every move. Outside the normal blaring light from the twin suns has been shaded in the approaching storm. The winds have steadily picked up blowing debris throughout the alley and visibility has been significantly reduced.
Still reaching out with the force Chase feels a tinge of darkness. Nothing outright evil but evil in intent. Searching through his emotions Chase is able to narrow in on this feeling. There is another out here working with the Gran`s inside. With the conversation with Tar`ja it takes a moment for Chase to focus his feelings. This one is up high and watching over both of the cantinas entrances.
The lead Gran breaks eye contact for a moment when Dexter boasts on Grumbo`s condition. About to reply the Gran opens his mouth only to close it abruptly all three of his eyes widening in realization as he looks back to Deidra. "A warrant you say." The Gran punches a few keys on his data pad and then passes it to the woman. "I think you would be most interested in this warrant." The Gran then stands and snaps his fingers. The Gran at the other table all stand hands on their weapons.

Just after he spoke he got a feeling from the force. The change in his demeanor would have been obvious to Tar'ja who stood close to him. Maybe it was because of the emotions he was having and expressing to Tar'ja that he didn't feel it before. Now that he was actually concentrating he felt that slight tell tale nudge that something wasn't right. He held on to the feeling and search for where it was coming from. He found it a moment later up high and judging from its intent it didn't bode well for the group.
He looked at Tar'ja. He could have been sucked back into their blue depths but now the situation was more serious. There was another watching. **"The Grans have another watching from out here. Up high from somewhere over there."** Chase indicated behind Tar'ja with a slight movement of his head. **"Things just got more serious. They may need help in there but there's the one out here who could be waiting."**

**Mos Eisley: The Melt Down CafÃ© â€“ Pre firefight** 
Naryen doesnâ€™t get much time to absorb how many things were wrong with what Dexter said, even to someone inexperienced in criminal or even organizational circles as her, before she sees recognition ripple across Twinys features. She may not be that familiar with non humans but thereâ€™s no mistaking that reaction. Dexter had provided the distraction Twiny needed to focus on her rather than what she was saying. ***So much for flexibility.***
"A warrant you say." After tapping a few keys he passes the pad to her, which she takes with a feeling of dread creeping into her reality,"I think you would be most interested in this warrant." He stands, all casual and business-like, summoning his support. At the other table the Gran stand, as summoned and ready to go, and approach their booth.
Her ability to absorb information quickly serves her well as she looks upon an Imperial Warrant for her neutralization. The list of baseless and trumped up charges was impressive and Naryen considers, sourly, that she found where the inflammatory rhetoric had gone from the news short shown earlier. The scenario looked grim, four armed, ready, and apparently trained mercenaries against an Officer commanding a crack team consisting of a Hot-shot pilot and an apparent Halfwit. (((OOC: She just got quite upset.)))
Naryen looks up from the pad to Kasga and Dexter. Her eyes are cold, hard, and curled with a feral edge as she looks at them from a down-turned face. Hopefully sheâ€™s able to convey a *NOW* Hopefully Dexter will take advantage of being shown the Grans back like that. It *could* happen.
A dark coil of rage twitched in her mind. It was more than anything that had happened to her before. This time it came from deep and it turned within giving her a clarity that would frighten her if she wasnâ€™t so supremely incensed. The episode in the Fossos hanger and now looking at the warrant that spells out accusations, including the genocide of her own people, complete with the Empire apparently not caring to question her. ***Corpses can say anything they want them to when the right spin is applied.***
She focuses upon her emotions and transmutes them as her years of conditioning allow her. She has an impulse of reaching to her ear to simulate using a com as she imagines Chase picking up on her feelings. ***Dead or alive and dead doesnâ€™t argue or resist. Weâ€™re corpses.***. Something occurs to her and she glances intently at Twinys ear looking for a concealed com but plods along with her only remaining course. ***As long as the guns arenâ€™t shooting thereâ€™s always another option and even then sometimesâ€¦*** While she does that she puts the pad into her bag, right next to her stun baton as she inhales slowly and deeply. She then projects with such force and enthusiasm she surprises herself with the power of it.
With her free hand open in front of her, to draw attention from her hand with the pad, she looks fully at the Gran that gave her the pad and bursts into riotous, insane belly laughter.
The scream that comes out hurts even her ears as itâ€™s projected at Twiny. **â€GARTUG THESE GRAN ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR DRINK FROM YOU!â€** Drawing then engaging the stun baton and swinging at the nearest Gran (I expect thatâ€™s Bendy). The look on her face, her eyes in particular, of total submit to crazed bloodlust, would scare her in another situation.

Tar'ja sensed the change in him and nodded her head slightly, just barely but enough for him to know she understood, so it was getting worse already and they had company on the outside. With a hum she looks to him and smiles, moving him towards the wall in, to what an outsider looking in might think was a turn in whatever conversation had happened to something more intimate, nothing to see here really.
Once at the wall she would tug at his clothes to turn them so her back was to the wall and he was leaning against her. "Sorry but...if I can see the person you sense maybe I can get a shot at them, best way to conceal this I think.." She flushes at him briefly before looking up to where he had indicated, hoping she could see something.

Dexter looks at the bounty hunters they are getting nervous about something, surely not him his fight almost cost him is life. "My friends please there is no need for hostileitys. I mean you no harm. As you can most of my friends have left me here anyway. What can someone like me do agianst beings such as yourselves." Dexter keeps talking hopeing that someone would do something soon. As he is talking he looks around trying to find something that might at least take a fewblaster bolts before it went to pieces, trying to distract and keep them off balance.

**The Melt Down Cafe**
Ever alert these Gran thugs always ready and wanting a fight watch over the negotiations between their leader and the human woman now called Deidra. From outside Chase hears Deidra`s scream but in his head before she voices it. Both Tar`ja and Chase hear Deidra scream out "GARTUG THESE GRAN ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR DRINK FROM YOU!" Inside this grabs the cantina`s attention, everyone turns to see the comotion everyone but Gartug that is who has found a small measure of peace face down at his table snoring his latest match away.
Sensing the incoming attack bendy or Aak-Yees as his parents had named him produces his weapon in a flash holding it in front of himself. With a simple nod from their leader Vean who shouts out "To arms brothers its pay day."
I a flash Vean has both of his blasters in his hands aiming one at Deidra he fires. With Deidra`s current launch towards bendy the shot impacts into the wall passing over her back. The shot dissipates into the wall in an arc of blue energy.
Aak otherwise known as bendy spins his blade to the right coming into a downward thrust at Deidra. The blade misses the intended mark cutting deep into the cushioned padding on the bench seat. So close to the bade Deidra can feel it shimmer and vibrate throughout her body. Aak violently yanks the blade from the bench holding it ready for the next swing.
Aks and Vee teh other two Gran at their original table stand ready weapons in hand. Vee with his rifle kneels behind the table aiming at the side door. Aks turns and fires on the both area , his shot goes wild leaving a fresh carbon score on the wall above Kasga the intended target.

**Outside the Meltdown Cafe**
Right after He told Tar'ja about the other Gran that was outside she moved into action. Chase felt himself being pulled and his clothed being tugged at. At first he wasn't sure what she was doing but then he got the idea. She was trying to spot the other Gran in the direction that he had felt him. Still he felt nothing through the Force from inside the Cafe. "Sorry but...if I can see the person you sense maybe I can get a shot at them, best way to conceal this I think.." He saw her blush slightly.
He didn't complain because as before they were close with him leaning against her. Her head was close as he brought his arms up again and held her sides. He stepped a bit closer, even though it was almost impossible, as his hands met at the small of her back. He looked down and saw her neck. Part of it was exposed and not covered by the hooded cloak due to their movements against the wall. It wasn't the right place but he gave in and bent his head down and gave her a soft kiss on the neck where it met the shoulder. Her skin was smooth against his lips. At the moment of the kiss he held a bit tighter.
His head snapped back quick as he heard Deidra scream. A scream not heard with his ears but within his head. His eyes were wide as he looked at Tar'ja. **"It's starting. I have to go in."** He said quickly almost out of breath. What he had heard in his head was quickly followed by Deidra's scream from inside. He backed away from Tar'ja and reached for his lightsaber. From the concealed holster he produced a cylindrical object that was about twelve inches long. The cool metal of its casing felt good in his hands. It had been a long time since he had last used it but the training was still there and he had had a good instructor.
He knew that they would be waiting for them. Call it intuition or the fact that maybe the other Gran on the outside was calling in information. It's what he would have done. Chase looked at Tar'ja and there was a look of calmness in his eyes as he moved towards the door aware that the other Gran had a view of it. **"Coming in with me or staying out here with the fifth?â€** He said with a slight smile on his face.
When he reached the door he opened it but didnâ€™t go through still cautious of the one that was watching the doors from somewhere.
OOC:
Move to draw lightsaber
Move to move to door
Swift to open door
Actions for round two, of you need them, will be to move in and charge the nearest gran he can find upon entering while igniting his lightsaber.

Finally, the waiting is over. This firefight is going to bring the Empire down on us. The bounty hunters don't have to worry about the attention. This needs to end quickly. Kasga shouts **"Rifle on side door."**

Tar'ja's eyes narrow as she searches the rooftops, but to no avail, she couldn't see the person that he was sensing. *There goes that idea..* she mutters in her mind, though it soon trails off to the notion of his lips against her neck, her eyes fluttering at the feel of it; if she just tilted her head down just a little...
"It's starting. I have to go in." He said just seconds before the scream of their comrade-of-an-ex-imperial broke through the evening sky. Her gaze snaps open at the scream and turns to the door over his shoulder then to him, she could feel his breath on her skin and oh how she didn't want him to go, he backed away from her, taking the...what the hell was that thing?
Her attention wavered to the object in his hands, was he going to club them or something? She watches him move to the door, pausing there to speak to her again "Coming in with me or staying out here with the fifth?â€ he says with a smile that had her grinning as well.
It seemed he was willing to expose himself for their comrade, and she didn't want to let him have all the fun..but..that fifth was going to be a problem for them if it wasn't taken care of now. Though, how could she taken care of it if she couldn't see it...She bites her lip and shakes her head, moving to him and running her fingers through his hair faintly, was she keeping up the act or using it as a way to do these sweet gestures?
"If it's not taken care of now...it will become more of a problem. I'll join you when it's taken care of if I can." She smiles lightly and makes to move away but pauses, well..."Just in case.." she says softly before pressing her lips to his in a quick kiss, pulling away and moving before he could put together what had just happened. She was going to find this person, end them and get back to Chase.

**Mos Eisley: The Melt Down CafÃ© â€“ *looks around for the source of the Star Trek duel music*** 
***Genocide.***
Naryens eyes were wide, almost pleading against the indefinable reality that is her mind-space, strained with an introverted look seemingly to distraction. The sound of the blaster shot rang in her ear as the vibroblade cut the air where her skull was only an instant before, though she only noticed it with a clinical detachment. ***Balance risk assessment.*** The coil of rage took on the qualities of a Varbrindian Ice bore as it reached out with cold tendrils searching for a heat source. Where they reached vengeance warred with fear and the battle raged with a ferocity that swallowed her sense of self. With the exception of her eyes, her face is a near-featureless void.
***Genocide.***
Her movements are trained responses, almost on remote, as she is maneuvering around him using her movements to keep him at bay. She looks at Bendy her eyes empty, almost like sheâ€™s looking through him to something far away. **â€Theyâ€™re all dead. I killed everyone.â€** Her voice is small, quiet. Yet carries with an eeriness some would associate with ghosts.
***Genocide.***
She looks in his face with that same pleading look, disconnected from her body that is fighting for itâ€™s life, like she wants him to explain that itâ€™s a mistake.
**â€Everyone is dead.â€**
***Genocide.***
((OOC: Iâ€™m sure this is a little unorthodox but Iâ€™m going with it: use of Persuasion as a Standard Action to deprive Bendy of his DEX bonus. Iâ€™m hoping it affects him as a demoralizing attack, whether reflected by game mechanics or otherwise. Swift and Move remain so perhaps the Move put to defensive actions or positioning so that Kasga or Dexter get a flanking bonus as well? I apologize for posting a Â½ post but Iâ€™m not clear how this works so assistance with this would be appreciated. Kasga and Dexter should see the effects on the Gran and move accordingly if it works. Burning what points are appropriate but there's a few bogies here to tend to.))

The Cantina erupts all around you, patrons dive behind tables for cover, the multi armed bartender ducks under his counter, and the serving girl so expertly disappears yet again. With practiced easy the cantina locals find cover while still holding their drinks, outside the crowds continue to walk past the door.
Chase rushes into the room kicking the door open with his foot and holding only a small metal tube. The Gran Aks squeezes the trigger to his rifle firing off a shot towards the interruption. The Grans shot falls short spraying carbon score across the cantina floor at Chases feet.
Shouting at the blade wielding Gran Deidra pushes herself into the bench using the table for cover from the attacks. Unsure of what to make of the human woman the Gran Aak stares at Deidra for a moment all three eyes open wide.
Kasga take hold of his weapon, aiming it at the rifle wielding Gran who just fired on Chase. With a quick shot Kasga misses, his blast goes wide hitting a bottle at the bar counter which sprays its liquid over the floor.
Not use to combat and out of his element Dexter try's to hold his pistol steady for a shot. Eyes half shut and pistol shaken Dexter fires off a shot at the lead Gran, Vean. Vean is forced to move his head back quickly to avoid taking a shot to the head. The Gran lets out a grunt at his rapid action to avoid the blast.
Outside Tar`ja scans the area looking all over for Chases fifth gunner. The storm has gotten closer stirring up the sand in the streets. Tar`ja shakes her head as she try`s to scan the roof tops despite the reduced visibility. So far the wind and sand are working against the Twi`lek woman.
Winded by Dexters attack but not losing focus on the big prize the lead Gran Vean takes aim at Deidra again. Both pistols leveled at the woman the Gran fires. The second shot a clear miss hitting the wall behind Deidra the first catches the human woman square in the chest. Blue energy surges through Deidra`s body.
Aak moves with his sights now set on Kasga. With a two handed over head swing Aak slices down hard then into a side ways slash. The air in front of the Duro`s pilot is blown into his face as the Gran over swings cutting deep into the side wall of the booth. Aak curses as he yanks the blade from the wall.
At the table Vee turns to the new threat to his gun man and takes aim at the booth. With a flash from his blaster he fires hitting the wall beside Dexter who is still in a little disbelief with his own shot on the lead Gran.
Seeing the danger from the table Chase begins to rush the two gunners. Still focused on Chase Aks takes aim with his rifle again at Chase squeezing off another shot. Chase rapidly closes the distance between himself and the Gran at the table, Aks shot goes high knocking out a light on the ceiling. The entire room stands still as Chases metal tube ignits into pure blue energy, Chase can almost feel the stares of the local patrons. Using his forward momentum Chase transfers that energy into his backwards saber thrust cutting deep across the Grans upper torso.

Seeing the Gran move near him, Kasga jerks back feeling the air move in front of his face. He siddles out of the booth as the Gran curses his blade embedded in the wall. Moving quickly across the aisle into another booth, he fires his Travotti Service Pistol quickly back at the Gran that just tried to cut him.

Chase stood there at the door as Tar'ja moved towards him. For a moment he thought she was going to rush in with him. He saw her bite her lower lip as if she was thinking on what to do. He looked at the beautiful Twi'lek that was covered by his cloak as she reached up and ran her fingers through his hair. The gesture sent a shiver down his spine. "If it's not taken care of now...it will become more of a problem. I'll join you when it's taken care of if I can."
He gave her a quick nod. **"You better because if you…."** He stopped talking as she came in close. "Just in case.." She interrupted softly, maybe even suggestively, as she pressed her lips against his. Before he could really register what she had done she had pulled away as was moving down the alley towards the fifth Gran. He smile widened as he finished his sentence. **"…don't, I'll find you and finish that kiss"** He said loud enough for her to hear.
With the noise of a table crashing from inside just a second later Chase stood away from the wall and planted his foot on the door kicking it wide as he entered with lightsaber in hand. His action caused a response as he saw the blaster shot score the floor at his feet. The smile from Tar'ja's kiss was still on his face as he saw the rifle wielding Gran and his companion taking aim at his friends at the booth.
His training kicked in as he knew he had to close the distance. His smile was now gone but it had appeared on the Grans face. At least what would pass for a smile from a Gran when he saw Chase charge him with a small cylindrical tube. Another shot from the Gran went high and hit the light above and behind the charging Jedi. The shower of sparks brighten the area briefly but them dimmed into a new level of darkness that the now destroyed light provided.
Half way to the Gran Chase hit the activation stud on his lightsaber. The tell-tale *snap-hiss* and a bright blue blade sprang to life from the hilt of his weapon illuminating the darkened area. The smile on the Gran seemed to disappear as a split second hush fell over the cafe. If Chase had had eyes in the back of his head he would have see all the patrons, not involved in the fight, looking at him. His momentum carried him close as Chase used it to make a more effective strike on the mercenary. His tactic proved sound as his backwards saber slash cut deep across the upper torso of the Gran.
Chase kept the pressure on as he reversed his swing and brought it back around with both hands still gripping the weapon. The hum it created almost made it sound alive as it arced back towards the Gran.
OOC:
Standard action : Attack the same Gran - Lightsaber +7 to hit 2d8+9 damage
for round four if Chase succeeds in dropping the gran he will move on the other one near him using martial arts (kick) if he is close enough. Unarmed +6 (1d8+5)
If he's not down a kick on same Gran
Any questions let me know.

Dexter keeps moving for cover of anything, table counter something. *"I am not made for this.

He standy his hand and fires off another shot at the lead Gran Bounty Hunter. "I guess "alive" is not going to be an option this time boys. The only way you are going to take back to your Slimo boss is feet frist." Dexter trys to sound like he is not phased by the combat but it is hard for him.

She moves slowly, her hand finding her blaster and fingering it, taking it from it's holster to keep it at the ready. She moves carefully, keeping her face as protected as she could while still letting her eyes search

**Mos Eisley: The Melt Down CafÃ© â€“ *looks around for the source of the Star Trek duel music*** 
The flash of pain, from the blast to the chest, washed over her. A ripple of anti-thought cascading over her senses as the screams of the dying filled her mind and choked out all else. A ripple of calm introduced to a pool of churning chaos. Memories dove to the front of her mind to fill the void that remained. Screams. Looks of betrayal on the faces of her kin. Officers and storm troopers, sworn to protect the Empire turning on the true resource of the Empire: its citizens. These people reduced to mere puppets of the Emperor who clearly is bent on domination and self destruction.
And taking them all with him.
***Genocide is it? Accused, by the Empire, of the very crime it committed against my people?***
Some distant part of her lineage calls forth berserker fury as she looks upon the Gran with the weapon that just shot her. Naryens face sets in a rigor of bared teeth and feral eyes as the shock of the blast is reflected in her eyes. Her gaze bores into the Gran, no small trace of madness here, as she projects her voice at him first, as she looks beyond him to the combat ready Jedi charging into the CafÃ© ***Why did you abandon Tarâ€™ja? I hope sheâ€™s hiding somewhere.*** Aloud to Twiny: **â€You are outmatched and outmaneuvered.â€** then to the people around her. **â€Get this puppet of the Emperor off me *now*!â€** Her speech comes out snarled, especially the second comment.
((OOC: Her projected personality should be keeping people off-balance. Hold initiative until the blade wielding Gran getâ€™s shot at then proceed with defensive stance/maneuver to provide any flanking benefit etc. Same attack form this time: Presence @ the one that shot Naryen then defensive action. **Tru: what does â€œBorn Leaderâ€ do? I see you mentioned that from Vean (Twiny?) & Naryen has it. Iâ€™d expect the effect would cancel out if itâ€™s a group effect but please let me know if itâ€™s an action I need to declare to use it.**
EDIT: Was just reminded, thank you Yogi, of something Naryen would have known to do so I'm declaring the Born Leader for her Swift Action and tying it to the **â€Get this puppet of the Emperor off me *now*!â€** for RP effect in this instance. That means Standard as the Presence, Swift as the Born Leader and the Move as either Defensive or positioning to provide flanking, whichever provides the most net benifit to the group. ))

Deidra makes a bold statement aimed as much at the Gran mercs as it is at her party. "You are outmatched and outmaneuvered.â€ followed by â€Get this puppet of the Emperor off me now!â€ Something about the determination in her voice bring renewed energy to you actions. Deidra continues to maneuver the table between herself and her attackers.
Kasga jolts for the next booth taking some cover within. Aiming at the vibro blade wielding Gran Kasga fires a volley. The blue energy hits the surprised Gran in the right shoulder, Ask grits his teeth as the energy surges through out his body. With a vocal protest of pain Aak slums noticeably but retains his footing.
Dexter follows Kasga`s move out of the booth and into the now shared booth. Blaster in hand Dexter squeezes off another shot at Vean. The shot goes wild hitting a far wall at the back of the cantina.
Meanwhile outside Tar`ja continues her scans of the area now focusing more on the roof tops. Within seconds she spots a figure shrouded by the growing sand storm but unmistakably a figure wielding a rifle aimed at the cantina`s main entrance. The figure is using the building as cover from the street and is about 20 meters away from your current position.

Outside Tar`ja has spotted the lone sniper who`s identity has been concealed within the building sand storm. Positive the snipers attention is focused on the main entrance Tar`ja moves in for a closer shot. Pistol ready Tar`ja fires but with the blowing sand manages only to hit the side of the building. The blast alerts the sniper who rushes for the full cover of the roof top.
Inside The lead Gran, Vean yells out to his comrades "This fight will have to wait. Regroup we will hit them again when we have the advantage. Move move move!" Vean rushes for the door clearing the distance to the main entrance. The Gran exits the room.
Vean is quickly followed by two of his Gran merc`s. Vee taking advantage of Chase`s preoccupation with Aks runs full tilt to the main door and outside with Vean. Aak aka bendy, grunts in protest to the move obviously wanting to even the score but follows quickly after his partners.
Aks always one to follow orders does not hesitate to fall back, though the light saber wielding human might have something to do with the Grans desire to exit this battle. Without hesitation the Gran bolts for the door.
Chase with his light saber in mid swing for his next strike connects with the retreating Gran. Aks stops suddenly as the saber connects with his abdomen. Aks crashes to the cantina floor as the light saber exits the Grans body.

**Mos Eisley: The Melt Down CafÃ© â€“ *Enter the tense commercial break*** 
Naryen watches Kasgasâ€™ blast take a toll on the Gran with the bent nose, the vibro blade and the attitude problem. His almost staggering form betrayed the effect, that she noted, as the ballet of greed fueled death continued. ***Where my currency was the ideals sold us, are we so different?***
The lead Gran, with his twin blasters, calls the retreat "This fight will have to wait. Regroup we will hit them again when we have the advantage. Move move move!" ***A promise of future engagements even more to their advantage! Indeed.*** She then observes his movements, using the injured Gran as a distraction to get around Chase, as he leaves the engagement. ***Heâ€™s using his ally to secure his escape? Is he abandoning him?*** His unimpeded exit, as Naryen runs to close the distance to keep them engaged with her, is embarrassingly complete.
She starts after them, the word â€œStopâ€ on her lips but itâ€™s then, thanks to the wonderful distraction of getting shot, that she notices the line of plasmic energy in the hands of a stranger at the door. Itâ€™s cool indifference casting an eerie glow throughout the room. Itâ€™s pulsing making the shadows twitch slightly in morbid anticipation of death and its tone irritating her ears. Her insides quake as she wrenches her focus from the weapon to the wielder desperately trying to look for something familiar as the already wounded Gran bolts for the door. ***â€No!â€***.
It happens with all the smoothness and inevitability of the best Imperial tactical training systems, which sheâ€™s used, showing the execution of a perfectly planned offensive. The back-swing met with the Grans abdomen without resistance. The boiling and cauterizing of his insides cast a sharp tang of burnt flesh in the air and with it the sound of meat on a skillet. Naryens senses erupted violently with the accompanying memories and as the Gran collapsed to, the dusty ground, like so much butchers discard. She could almost see her parents falling under the weapons of Imperial Troopers as if she was the one holding the weapon.
Almost.
**â€No!â€**
Desperation. Fear. Rage. All erupt from her in that one word as she looks up from the Gran to Chase. Naryen is close to him, but still outside the reach of his blade, as she stares at his face searching for some sign of his further intent. Her eyes pleading, more for herself then to him, as she looks for something she can grab from her mind other than the trained responses this called for.
She, instead, acts upon a whole other set of trained responses as her eyes resolve and harden as she reaches into her pack.
With a cool tone, voice cast for Chase, she steps forward and asks of him **â€I hope Tarâ€™ja is safe from them.â€** casting her vision out the door after the retreating mercenaries as she steps past him with a medkit in hand and kneels to the downed Gran.
***The engagement ended too abruptly! Ruse or not this being may die without my aid.*** She sets to work assessing and treating the Grans wounds.

The image of that night creeps back into his mind. He can hear the sound of there boots over and over , the sound of his parents screaming out. He freezes and slums to the floor sitting there he stairs off into nothing as the memory plays in his mind. Anyone looking at him would have thought he wasa scared child cowering in the corner.

As Chase was bringing his humming blade back around as the lead Gran called out for a retreat. From the corner of his eyes he saw the others bolt and leave. From the Gran he faced he saw the look of an obeyed order from the Grans eyes as the alien moved. His sudden movement brought him more into contact with the fast moving lightsaber that was coming for him.
It happened too quickly for Chase to just draw the weapon back an inch or two. Instead of the quick sweeping strike he had hoped for Chase's strike instead bit deeper than he wished. The bright blue blade passed through the Gran's abdomen effortlessly as it moved. Chase watched as the Gran crumpled to the floor, his middle basically cut into two. Wisps of smoke along with the smell of cauterized flesh rose from the fallen mercenary.
Chase turned to follow the last of the Mercs that were leaving the door his lightsaber still held in a guard position. The blue light came from the blade cast a erie glow over himself and surrounding area.
â€No!â€ He heard a scream as he looked a who to see who did it. When he saw who it was he lowered his guard his face softened as he looked at his friend. It seemed odd to be considering a former Imperial a friend.
He saw Deidra who just outside his weapons reach. Emotions both seen on her face and felt through the Force were strong, raw and unhinged. Nothing was held back. The look was reminiscent of the one she had in the cockpit back at Fosso's. The "enemy Jedi" was in front of her. She seemed to be fighting with her training. He lowered his guard even more to her. Trying to showing her that he was no threat to the former Imperial.
She seemed to get some composure as her expression changed to somewhere near normal as she stepped forward towards him and the Gran. Her hand reached into her bag. ***what's she reaching for?*** He relaxed slightly when she produced a med kit instead of her blaster.
â€I hope Tarâ€™ja is safe from them.â€ She said in he cool tone as she looked at the doorway.
His eyes widen as he looks at her. **"She isn't. She was going after their sniper that was watching the front entrance."**  A feeling of dread, that showed on his face, came over him as he realized that she could be trapped between them. He looked at Kasga and Dexter. The latter was now slumped on the floor muttering to himself.
He switched off the his weapon and the blade disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. Looking at Kasga and Dex he motioned to the door as he moved in its direction. **"Come on she's outside going after their fifth member. She could get trapped between them."** He didn't wait he was fairly sure that Kasga would follow. He'd seen his type before combat hardened and a steady resolve. Dex on the other hand sat there like a child. ***Not everyone handles combat the same Chase. Some aren't cut out for it.*** He moved to the main door, that the Gran had left from, drawing his blaster as he did so and looked for the way they went.
He'd find Tar'ja. He promised he would. The Gran would not stop him from that.
OOC:
Swift: for the conversation
One move to follow
Standard or move to sense where Tar'ja is. UtF +9
Hopefully Kasga and maybe Dex will follow.
Also are we still in combat? If not than I will edit the post about Chase drawing his blaster.

Tar'ja couldn't help the stream of curses that fell from her lips, figured, it just would figure that the sand would blow right at that moment into her line of sight and prevent her from hitting the target.
She lets out a sigh of air, her attention moving to the door as it opens and the grans begin to file out. Well that was rather nice of them to file out like that. She lifts her blaster again and aims at the first one to exit, well as that old saying goes when the world closes a window they open a door....or was it the other way around?
Her little grin stays on her lips as she fires off a shot.

Naryen watches the realization on Chases face as the implications of her question take hold. With widened eyes he admits "She isn't. She was going after their sniper that was watching the front entrance." then looks to Kasga and Dexter. ***A sniper covering the frontâ€¦*** She recalls the street layout and the surrounding area and buildings ***â€¦of course! Itâ€™s so basic!***
â€˜Sheathingâ€™ his â€¦ lightsaber? Chase called to Kasga and Dex, motioned to the door as he moved in its direction and called for allies. "Come on she's outside going after their fifth member. She could get trapped between them." He drew his blaster as he approached the door. Naryen glances at the other two, quickly assessing their states. She barked at them, in her best drill sergeant voice, in particular at Dexter once she saw him. **â€œGo with him. Move!â€** then turns her attention back to the Gran, now that she has the kit opened and is within reach of his vitals. She moves his blade from his reach but keeps it in view.

After the Gran falls, Deirdra surges forward to his side. Cursing to himself, Kasga considers, *Not now. We're still in a firefight.* Chase seems to recover himself, then hares off to help Tar'ja. Kasga pelts after him. **"Sniper! Did I hear that right."**, Kasga gasps as he blows past him into the street.

Seeing the Gran go down Deidra rushes over to give some form of aid, anything to help. The last few days have been so chaotic to say the least it has the human woman running on instinct. Sliding down to the Gran`s side Deidra looks around for anything that could be used to tend to the fallen Gran mercenary.
Kasga hearing Deidra`s words rushes the cantina front doors. The Duro`s easily covers the distance to the doors and barges through them. Finding himself almost rushing head first into the backs of the retreating Gran merc`s. Kasga comes to a halt just before the vibro wielding Gran.
Dexter unsure of what to do and not use to such a action packed afternoon waits for orders, a sign anything that would give The Bothan the next best course of action.
From outside Tar`ja see`s the Gran merc`s crash through the cantina doors follow by Kasga who almost runs into them. Blaster in hand Tar`ja squeezes off a shot at the lead Gran. Vean lets out a low yelp as Tar`ja`s shot grazes his arm.
From the roof another blast can be heard. The sniper has repositioned himself and has taken aim at Tar`ja. With years of training as her guild Tar`ja is barley able to turn with the shot lessening the actual impact but taking a grazing wound instead.
Angered Vean yelps out "Run you fools run, regroup we will reorganize." With a hand on his shoulder Vean runs across the streat and into a nearby alley. At full speed his remaining Gran companions follow Vean into the alley disappearing around a corner.
Chase dashes for the cantina door after Kasga not wanting his friend to run out there alone with a group of Gran merc`s. With a look over to Dexter Chase then exits the cantina, several patrons maintain their cover behind the tables as Chase passes them. Outside Chase meets up with Kasga and off to the side Tar`ja who has obviously just been shot. Kasga focus is on the alley directly across the street though you see no signs of the Gran merc`s.

Tar'ja grips her arm where the shot had grazed her, wincing at the sting of pain. She should have been able to dodge that,seemed maybe she was getting rusty. Glancing up at the grans as they run off she sighs, so much for hitting them while they were still in view.
Her gaze travels briefly to the two that had exited the cantina, lowering her blaster slightly as her gaze falls on Chase, a sigh of relief escapes her, she had been concerned about him exposing himself but it seemed he was fine. Her gaze then travels up to the building, was the sniper still there? did it run off with the others?

Dexter still hearing the sound of the that night in his head, is jared back into reality by the sounds of some one yelling at him. He stands up and heads where he is told. His blaster still in hand and following who Chase had told him to. *"This is crazy. I shouldn't be like this I have been in situations like this before. What is wrong with me."* Thinking to himself. He seems to not be paying attention to what is around him with is not a good thing given the situation.

Kasga blew by him has he looked at Deidra tending to the fallen Gran. Her words of motivation obviously heard by the pilot. Dex on the other hand seems to be finally coming around. Shaking his head as he couldn't wait for the con man as two of the team were already outside with the mercs.
Turning he passed several patrons who were still behind cover. Chase paid them no mind as he hurried for the door with both weapons in his hand. Exiting the door he came up along side of Kasga. To the extreme right of his vision he picked up the sight of Tar'ja. He smiled as he saw that she was alright but then noticed that she was holding her arm.
***Is she hurt, was she shot?*** The thought ran through his mind as he looked at Kasga who was focused on the alley. He took a step toward Tar'ja as if he was going to run towards her but then looked back to the alley he assumed the Grans had went. Cursing he changed direction and ran in the direction that Kasga had been looking. The Grans needed to be stopped so they couldn't regroup and come after them.

As Chase runs for the alley following the Gran's, Kasga yells out, **"Chase, stop! We need to get out of here."**
In keeping with that plan, Kasga looked up at the sniper targeting his freinds. Not having enough time to aim well, he squeezes off a shot a little higher than usual. Hopefully, he'll get above the cover being used and make the shot count, otherwise, he might make the sniper keep his head down. Not waiting to see if his shot counts, Kasga sprints for one of the ripples in the cantina's wall squeezing in behind it hoping the sniper doesn't get a good firing solution

She looks at the Gran, dying in front of her, and feels utterly powerless. ***I have no resources, no-one to call for support. Weâ€™re it!***

In the Cantina Deidra kneels over the fallen Grans body using her hands to apply pressure to the wound the human is running out of options. Around Deidra the local patrons sensing the worst is over return to their tables and continue to drink away their day while the multi armed bar keep frowns at Deidra as he over looks the recently made mess.
The patrons begin hushed conversations amongst themselves "This will surely bring storm troopers this way." "Oh boy more imperial questioning." "Not if I am too drunk to answer them." Through the entire event Gartug the Gammorrea pit fighter never lost a wink of sleep never lost a beat with his rhythmic snoring.
Deidra closes her eyes still kneeling over the Gran merc she can feel his life slipping away his life pulse slowly growing weaker. The woman`s hands slip away from the Gran`s wound as she feels the last of his life slip away. Knowing there was nothing she could do the woman's head still lowers just a little more defeated.
Outside the chaos continues, Kasga takes this opportunity to fire on the sniper sensing his eminent retreat. The angle over cover provided by the building the sniper only increases the difficulty of the shot. Taking aim Kasga fire but manages only to scare the building itself with a fresh carbon score.
Just outside the cantina Dexter holds his head in his hands still in shock at not only the current events around him but suffering through recent events that lead him here. Shaking his head the Bothan knows hesitation could take him out of the game permanently, something his former mentors had on many occasions warned him of.
Tar`ja scans the area as she looks to find comfort beside Chase. The human is determined and is already pulling away still in chase of the Gran merc`s. On the roof top the unknown sniper pulls back and disappears using the roof top as cover. Tar`ja continues to scan the area but is unable to see the sniper or the retreating merc`s current location or destination.
Chase still in pursuit still in singular focus clears the street and enters the alley. At full speed the human runs to the end of the alley only to come to a four way intersection between the buildings. At the end of each intersection could be the escape route of the Gran merc`s or they could have entered one of the many buildings through the alley entrances.

<strong>Mos Eisley: The Melt Down CafÃ© aka the tomb of the damned.</strong>
Images swirl of a planet of death, her home, the smug smile partially shaded by a black hood forms in her mind looking over it. The mouth twisted by unatural age and eyes yellowed by some further unatural energy. The image is familar somehow yet she cannot yet place it. The face flashes to that of the passive uncaring expression, topped with blond hair, and the light blue of some pulsing energy reflected in equally uncaring eyes.
***Death is your companion my dear.*** speaks an imagined voice in her mind. So it seems.
Sitting next to a corpse, watching the life leave him, Naryen realizes how incomplete her military experiences were and how unprepared she is for the galaxy as it really is. Life is hard and a premature death is, apparantly, the very frequent end a hard life meets.
The weight this adds cause her shoulders to slump in a genuine expression of a being feeling a crushing defeat. Her head hung forward over the now expired Gran. Her hands gripping the tops of her thighs, fists twisting her clothing painfully. Sitting on her ankles, her knees in the dirt, some distant part of her mind tries desperately to keep her from curling forward into a ball. She succeeds in not sucumbing to the impulse.
Mostly.
Abandoned by her allies, with no safe way to contact them, perhaps the lone survivor of a dead planet and a corpse remain behind and seekers of further death pursue each other to that end. He hand wanders to her pistol, seemily of it's own accord, and holds it gingerly. Somehow the instrument of death feels comforting in her hand, like the security of a warm bed after a hard day offers rest to the weary.
((OOC: For this round she remains where she is, as is.))

**OOC:**
I'm going to assume that we're out of combat now so I won't worry about stating actions now. I hope that's good with you Tru since Chase isn't going to continue chasing the Gran's.
**IC:**
Kasga's shout falls on deaf ears for the moment as the Jedi ran in pursuit of the retreating Grans. Running all out down the alley way was his only way to catch them. The track that would have been visable under normal contitions were already gone due to the amount of dust and sand that teh storm had picked up. As it was the alley afforded his some protection form the increasing winds that surely weren't at their stongest yet.
Chase slid to a stop at the intersection. Looking in the other three directions that they could have went he silently cursed to himself. He should have been reaching out to find them as he ran. He knew how to do it but for some reason it just the idea just didn't come to him. It was another glaring aspect that his training was not yet complete. With a quick look behind him he saw no backup and he rereated a step. One he could take on by himself. Maybe two but the the whole group. He ran back back to the street holstering his blaster but left the lightsaber in his hand for the moment. This time he did reach out with his Jedi senses to the surrounding area. At least he could tell if they were near or had really run off to regroup.
He exited the alley and stood the street across from the cafe as the sand blew. Covering his eyes as best as he can he looked around he saw Tar'ja and Kasga. A smile and a sense of relief came over Chase as he saw that the two of them were alright. With a wave he motioned for them to come back to the cafe. He really wanted to go to Tar'ja and make sure she was alright but other things needed to be taken care of first. With that thought he looked at the front door of the cafe to which he quickly made his way over to.
Pushing the door open he entered lightsaber still in hand. The establishment, for the most part looked the same. Patrons continued to sit at their places despite the overturned tables, shot out lights, and a dead Gran who had nearly been cut in half. The pungant smell of a burn wound still hung in the air as he looked at Deidra who was still kneeling beside the fallen merc. Insted of a medpac she held her blaster in a death grip.
Remembering the look she gave him before he ran out after the merc's he quickly turned to the side and left the hand holding his Jedi weapon behind his leg. He didn't know what to think or what she would do. Would she snap like in the cockpit? The difference now was that she held a weapon. As did he.
In his calmest voice he spoke to her as he reached out with the Forec to her. **"Come on we have to go before the Imperials or those Gran's come back. We don't have a lot of time."** As he spoke feelings of comfort and friendship flowed out from the Jedi to the former Imperial. He knew that this might not be a good idea but he had to make her realize that he isn't the enemy. **"Lets grab our gear and check him for anything useful before we leave."** Even though he spoken, he hadn't yet moved.
**OOC:**
Tru, I guess Chase would ready an action to ignite his lightsaber in an attempt to deflect the shot that may or may not come. Not sure how you would want handle that. I'm planning on taking Jedi as my next level and taking deflect.
Edited for grammar and cleaned up a sentence or two.

Tar'ja had been waiting outside, she didn't think running was a grand idea as it would only aggravate the wound, much to her dismay. She was still berating herself slightly for not taking more time in her aiming, she could have gotten that sniper if she had just been more patient.
Sighing to herself she see's the Jedi returning from his run, gladness fills her that he was alright They had a job still to do, more so they needed to get as far from the cantina as possible. With her hand still wrapped around her arm to hold the wound, a vague attempt to make it feel better as well as to stop the bleeding.
Pushing off the wall with her foot she follows him into the cantina, looking to the other to see if he would follow. She uses her shoulder, the good one, to push the door open and allow her entrance, and a look to the scene. "wow...I missed a hell of a party..." a bit of humor..though probably not the best nor the best time, but something to alivate the situational tension that seemed to be coming off of Chase.

Kasga's shout is ignored by Chase as he runs on down the alley. Kasga hunkers down next to the wall, waiting for the sniper to show his face again. Chase came back out of the alley and signalled an all clear then slid back across the street and through the cantina door. Kasga held his position covering Tar'ja as she followed Chase back through the door. After the street was clear, Kasga stepped back through the door and waiting just inside it for the group to organize itself. It wouldn't do to let one of the bar patrons take a pot shot at them while the were regrouping.

<strong>Mos Eisley: The Melt Down CafÃ© aka the tomb of the damned.</strong>
Naryen heard people the casual shuffling of feet entering the CafÃ© in front of her. The sound of sand and grit under-foot was a comforting irritant; it didn't sound like people looking for a fight.
At first.
She looked up to see Tar'ja and Chase followed by the prudent Kasga and cautious Dexter. ((OOC:Per Ganthets last post Dexter is still, as far as I'm aware, "following Chase" at this point.))
Her expression was, at first, strained with her eyes noticably moist. Her body both tense and yet somehow yeilding, like the strong trunk of a major flora broken by a storm. When she looked up to Tar'ja the expression changed to freindly recognition, like a wave accross a pool, softening and relaxing considerably. Her body followed her expression as a weary smile started on her face.
***She's ok, good!*** Her eyes close and she lower head slightly with a small relieved sigh. Naryen considers, for a moment, how worried she was for Tar'ja and thankful that the brightly colored Twi'Lek still has her features covered in case more mercs in the CafÃ© were feeling greedy.
She then heard Chase speaking to her in a calming voice. "Come on we have to go before the Imperials or those Gran's come back. We don't have a lot of time." Naryen noted quickly that her reaction was more than his tone would explain. ***He's not that persuasive…*** "Lets grab our gear and check him for anything useful before we leave." Her eyes widened in realization then flashed to him, feral and hostile, as her hand tightended on her pistol. ***He's trying to manipulate me!*** Naryen recalled how he affected the troopers and the similarities to what he was doing. ***Am I next you callous arrogant…!?***
It's then that her observations of Tar'ja register and her expression changes, yet again, to wide eyed concern and she looks back to her... friend?
Tar'ja was holding one of her shoulders differently and the opposing arm was wrapped around and supporting the arm for that shoulder, as evident by her posture showing a change in her center of mass and a flinching around her neck. There was also a noticable scoring to that side of her clothing. ***She's been shot!***
A smirk comes to Twi'leks face as looks around the CafÃ© "wow...I missed a hell of a party..."
Naryen nearly beamed at her then relaxed her grip, returning her pistol to it's place as she stands and strides towards her friend. Halfway there she looks to Chase and pierces him with a determined look colored with anger, disgust and admonition. With an open and extended empty hand to the still warm corpse on the ground, her tone is nothing to be debated with: **"That was unnecessary."** Her voice is pitched and projected such that it echoes off the walls all around the room but is somehow not overly loud. Her nose curls in revolsion just before she closes her eyes a moment as she puposefully wipes the expression from her features to then look at Tar'ja, now in front of her.
With uncertain warmth and a welcoming smile Naryen speaks with a voice that seems somehow not as practiced but no less genuine. **"Looks like you've had a party of your own."** She motions to the door. **"We need to get moving, now, but I want to look at you when there aren't so many observers."**
((OOC: Good thing Tar'ja is playing body guard!))

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-07-22 15:12:20)

Tar'ja had been watching the woman that had somehow recently lost the title of ex-imperial and simply become woman, or as her thoughts were shifting on her Deidra. Since when had the woman garnered a name in her mind? Did this mean then that the woman had earned trust? she hadn't killed the others at least, she seemed to have held up her own and in her book competence was looked more upon then personality and past faults.
Granted being an Imperial was a fault but now...now the lilac twi'lek felt she could overlook that little mistake. Maybe it was the smile sent her way, the look of relaxing, had she been worried? Strange...when was the last time someone had worried about her well being? Not the family, that was for sure, only worried if the information they had earned and gained would be lost with the body.
Still, this...sense of worry in her demeanor was comforting, a smile would find itself flitting over her features though not the same one that was gifted to the human Jedi, no no, that one was different but this...this maybe could be called a blossom for friendship. Yes, she could be friends with this one.
"That was unnecessary." Tar'ja's musing come to a stop as she realizes things had been happening while she had been lost in her own thoughts, thankfully part of her mind had been keeping notes and relays what had happened. So the merc on the ground had been the doing of Chase? or was it the comment of looting the body so to speak? hm..
No time left to ponder as the woman...as Deidra was again looking to her, the eyes warm, another odd thing for the twi'lek to see, well from a woman at least, Chase was different. The smile though on her face was infectious, causing a faint smile to flit to the twi'lek's features as well; she turns to the door to leave with the group but couldn't help to answer "This? it's nothing, flesh wound really." to Illistrate her point, the twi'lek removes her hand to roll her shoulder, her eyes nearly rolling into her head with a faint stagger from pain, alright; so maybe that wasn't the best idea, figuring out where her feet were and how to get them moving again seemed to be more trouble after that spike of pain, her hand returning to the wound as though to contain said pain. "Then again. Maybe a quick look couldn't hurt." She offers a weak grin as to lighten the mood.

### **Yogi** (2009-07-22 15:12:47)

**Mos Eisley: The Melt Down CafÃ© - Has she lost all of her screws?**
Chase stood there as he watched Deidra go through a range of emotions. All of them powerful even more so to him as he sould not only see them but feel them through his connection with the Force. As he spoke to her he tried to reinforce a calmness to her through the Force but it didn't work out as planned. ***Karking hell.*** He thought as he saw her tighten her grip on the blaster that was still in her hand. The look in her eyes was a dangerous one and those behind him, if they were looking, saw his grip tighten on his lightsaber hilt. ***Don't do it Deidra. Not here not now.***
She looked pased him at Tar'ja who had entered right after he did. He didn't turn as he knew where she was, behind and off to the side a bit. Emotions also flowed from the Twi'lek, pain that the would was causing and maybe concern were the ones he felt the most. Tar'ja's take on the events that happened inside the cafe were an understatement. But it was those words that made Deidra come back from that feral state she had almost succumbed to.
As Deidra stood and holstered he weapon he looked to Tar'ja and smiled. It was the smile that he had used for only her since they met. He was glad that she was ok and that the wound was not serious. The sound of the Imperials boot on the cafe floor caught his attention as he looked back at Deidra. The look on her face was one that would have fozen water. He didnt need the Force to know what she was feeling as it was written across her face plain as the sand outside. "That was unnecessary."
He looked to the body that laid there. Still basically still in the same position as when it fell. He quickly looked back to Deidra before she looked away. **"And unfortunate."** He said as she walked past
He watched her face as she spoke to Tar'ja. ***Will she ever understand that I'm not her enemy. Has the indoctrination by the Empire totally wiped away any possibility for her to work with me? Or even understand who and what I am? I didn't ask for this ability. Yet it's a respopnsibility that I now carry with a willingness like never before. If she can't come to grips with it I may have no option but to continue on.***
The last thought makes him look at Tar'ja. The beautiful Twi'lek stood before Deidra as the Imperial talked to her about her wound. The look in his eyes just then showed the hurt that would rest in his chest if he did decide to leave. He liked these people even though if they were a motley group. He cared enough to throw away his secret to protect them. And in doing so may have caused the groups own destruction. He looked into Tar'j's eyes from where he stood. All he wanted to do right now was take care of her arm and hold her close somewhere safe.
Turning away he advanced a step to the dead Gran and knelt down. with his lightsaber still gripped in one hand he used both to search the Gran for anything that might be of use, comlink, cred-chip, or any information that may help in dealing with them in the future. When finished he stepped up close to Tar'ja as he returned his weapon to its concealed spot. **"You ok?"** The look in his eyes said more but this wasn't the place or time to espress what he was thinking. They needed to move.

The soft voice to her side and slightly behind her brought her head back around to see the eyes of the human that had become dear to her in so short a time, something that made her wonder what more would come from it given the chance? "Are you ok?" was all he asked but his eyes held so much more, His smile, the one she had deemed simply for him crosses her lips and reaches her eyes as she nods slightly "I will be."
She wanted to get off the planet, steal a ship if she had to and set it for someplace quiet and far away where she could just be with him until...well...until the end she supposed. She wondered then, if she felt the emotions for it, could he feel it? could he see it in her eyes? A vague note was checked onto the proverbial datapad of her mind to ask him more about the horse thing....horse? no that wasn't right, force! that was it. yes the force thing.

Despite the cold front that was coming off Deidra, Chase was warm again. It wasn't the Tatooine heat that made him feel like this it was the one he stood next to. Tar'ja. With her response and the smile thst she used for him, he nodded and smiled back. Still wide open to the Force he thought he picked up on something from her. He tilted his head to the side ever so slightly. He wasn't quite sure what it was. Emotions like hate, anger, revenge were easy to pick up. Other emotions weren't so for him it was another reminder of his uncompleted training. Still it was something to ask about later.
He looked to Dexter. The fight had really affected the conman. He was just standing there almost oblivious to his surroundings. **"Hey we have to go. Come on."** He said to the Bothan with a wave to emphasize his point. He thought he saw Dex nod slightly. He sighed. ***Great at the first sign of blasters and he's crawled up into his shell. Maybe the rebellion isn't for you Dex.***
Looking to the door he saw Kasga standing guard. With a nod he acknowledged the effort of watching over them. As it was a good thing to always be covered.
He looked at Tar'ja nas then to Deidra and spoke quietly. **"We have to move now and get to where we need to be. This isn't the best place for conversation anymore."** He looked at Kasga and then the two ladies. With a nod of his head to the side door indicating a possible way to go. He looked at Tar'ja and held out his hand. **"You ready to get out of this place?"**

Tar'ja nods slightly to the question sent her direction, the tilt of his head as he seemed to be thinking deeply was...endearing...cute..yes..cute. Though she didn't allow the hand on her wound to move she did offer the hand from said wounded arm to take this.
"Best we leave now while we can." She glances to the woman beside her "Ready to leave now Deidra?" it was the first time she'd actually said her name to her face, a sign of trust maybe? Still a faint grin was offered to her, though still nothing like the one reserved for Chase.

Kasga keeps scanning the room as the others talk. Watching his companions peripherially, he notices the tense byplay. *God I'm glad I was with Kirn and got all this sorted out before now….I hope he's alright…*
Things seem to be ready to move again. Deirdra again seems to be the deciding factor....

"And unfortunate." The tone and expression from Chase grated her greatly. ***Is he suggesting that he acts like a force of nature free of consequence or conscious? Unfortunate like the weather or other random happenstance!?*** Her anger simmers and though she struggles to conceal it, as she speaks with Tar'ja, she's sure she is is failing. As much as she is trying to direct her focus to her wounded... friend? it keeps drifting to Chase, with darting glances and twists on her expression.
"We have to move now and get to where we need to be. This isn't the best place for conversation anymore." Naryens expression starts to shift to something approaching bewilderment. ***Surely he doesn't see that as insightful or does he expect we aren't intelligent enough to know this already?*** She blinks slowly for a moment and draws a calming breath released through pursed lips. ***Careful Naryen, he could be playing on your emotions again.*** A look of concern back to Tar'ja as Naryen waits for her to indicate what she's comfortable with. ***Can you wait until we are on the move or do we need to look at this wound first?***
"You ready to get out of this place?" She feels his attention on them now and it makes her skin crawl, though Tar'ja provides a needed distraction, again. Not so long ago she thought of this person as a terrorist and now she is a calming influence and as close to a kindred spirit as she's had in, it seems, a very long time.
"Best we leave now while we can." ***Ah, you're ok to travel, very well then.*** She puts a confident expression into her posture and face and makes to stay with Tar'ja in case she is underestimating her condition. "Ready to leave now Deidra?" A flash of scrutiny colors her face at this. ***Covering with bravado by suggesting it's up to me? Are you more injured than you're even letting on?*** She washes the look from her face and discards considerations of the Jedi until later.
**"Of course, just wanting to make sure you're ok for travel. As I said, we need to leave, now."** She steps to Tar'jas side and offers an arm for support. She looks to Dexter, who as far as she can recall was the one with the direction details. **"We're in need of transport so best haste to the beast and cart and from there to our objective, lead the way please."**
She looks one more time at the corpse then back to Chase. The flash of disgust is clear, then, and she turns from him with a grimace to then direct her attention back to Tar'ja intent on using the injured Twi'lek as a distraction for the sake of the ... mission?

I have problems with pitched battles." Dexter follows his friends along tying to muster his courage as best he can. He pushes his fear of that night down as deep as he can.

Recovering from the recent ordeal you gather back inside the cantina with Kasga watching the street from the main entrance. The Gran has not made it alive through the mess and the patrons have gone back to their drinks. The bar keep wipes his table down but shakes his head when h looks down at the mess your group has made on his floor. A few of the patrons share glances towards your group and some finger pointing in Chase`s direction.
At Chase`s suggestion the Gran is searched over. On the Grans body you find a blaster pistol, two extra clips, and 45 credits you also notice the Gran was dressed in fine silks with a heavy odor of perfume.
Deidra`s comm opens while your group decides the next course of action. Answering the hail hesitantly the mono tone voice of SBC-54 comes in "This is human cyborg unit SBC-54, you have troopers incoming on your position. I have concluded the arrangements with Fosso over the purchase of the ship. Report." The droids voice is low but clear, you doubt anyone beyond your groups huddle could have over heard the comm.
From the door way Kasga stops a few figures in the distance. The storm continues to rage with sand and debris swirling throughout the streets reducing visibility. Unable to mak out numbers Kasga is sure they are not mere locals marching towards the cantina. Having spotted a small group of Jawas earlier heading out of the city these new figures are marching side by side and armed with what could be rifles.
Everyone but Kasga has heard the driods message, SBC-54 awaits a reply. With the current hush within your group a few locals make obvious attempts to listening on your group. Kasga doubts that he has been spotted by the incoming group at this point, the storm is reducing visibility though that will change soon with their current pace.

Walking away from the front door, Kasga joins the rest of the group. Speaking low, Kasga hisses, **"Troopers are coming. Let's go out the back way. We have no more time for discussion."** With that, he walks over to the side door pushing it open, Travotti service pistol still in hand. He looks out cautiously looking to avoid another ambush.

Tar'ja sighs, her lekku twitching in agitation, things just went from bad to worse. Looking up to the ceiling as though to ask some higher power, 'why me' she looks to the others as Kasga speaks. The twi'lek nods her head in agreement "He's right we need to move quickly now."
Her arm was still hurting her, but she wouldn't let it stop her, Clutching just a bit more maybe but not stop her. Turning on her heel she looks to the woman then to Chase "out the side and as quick as we can away, the storm should give us some cover but it won't be a lot. If we move quickly and stick to the shadows for more cover we should be ok. If we leave in small groups it would probably be even better, making it look like people simply going home from drinking, taking different routes if necessary but not for long."
Stealth was her specialty, she didn't want to split up but the quicker and safer they did this the higher their probability for success would be. She moves to the side door and waits for them in the alley way outside, making sure her hood is up over her face. She knew Deidra and Chase would follow and the bothan after them rather than be left behind. Once outside they'd be able to make plans easier without risk of being overheard.

Naryen was staring at her comlink trying desperately to to understand what had just happened. She was wondering why her com was powered on, like a broadcast beacon to her movements, when she recalls that she disabled the connection on her Portable but not her comm. She was further baffled as to why she opened the channel! Well, what's done is done. The triangulation, if it was done, was established when she opened the channel to hear SBCs message arrive.
***That Recorder had better explain how he got this comm signal.***
As she was about to respond she notices the efforts of the locals to overhear and considers relocating to the alley to complete her business call. It's then that Kasga walks in covered in a fine layer of wind blown grit, his eyes looking rather irritated by the outside air. "Troopers are coming. Let's go out the back way. We have no more time for discussion." With that, he walks over to the side door pushing it open, Travotti service pistol still in hand.
Naryen, with only the briefest pause as she considers how much she likes that Duros, nods and makes after him with a gesture and a glance to Tar'ja to stay with her. As she crosses the room she responds in the Comm **"Confirmed. Stand-by."** while Tar'ja is speaking to the rest. Naryen waits for Kasgas indication the alley is clear before leaving so she can respond to that blasted automotan.
***Perhaps that trooper, from Fossos hanger, that seemed so interested in me reported back and this is simply a distraction for the troopers to use.***
It's then she hears Tar'ja explain an exit plan, which while seemed sound, was certainly not something to discuss where the patrons can overhear. She glances wide-eyed at Tar'ja, gesturing for silence, then returns her attention Kasga as quickly as she can so as not to miss his sign.

"Great here we go again." Dexter says as he follows the others out the back way. Getting shot at was not his thing. He was the type that snuck in and did what was needed and left. Being a spy he tried to stay out of notice of others and fires fights attract atention that he didn't want. "We will have to it in contact with. SBC- 54 soon as we can."

Chase stood with the two females. Both held his attention but the reasons couldn't be any farther from each other. Looking at Tar'ja he knew that the lilac colored beauty would be alright but he wondered if she wanted anymore help than she was letting on. Help that he would gladly give. With just a shift of his eyes he looked at Deidra who was also helping the Twi'lek. He could tell that she was trying not to look at him. He thought he could feel the mistrust for him that she carried. Chase sighed knowing that this would have to be worked out at a later time.
He was about to ask Tar'ja something when Deidra's comm went off. On the other side was their droid contact. SBC-54. His news was not all good. The ship purchase was finalized but Troopers were coming. The point was emphasized when Kasga came from the front door way with news. "Troopers are coming. Let's go out the back way. We have no more time for discussion." The Duros, who was business as usual, made his way to the side door and opened it.
Chase caught Tar'ja's look to the heavens and smiled. Though injured she was still thinking quickly and elaborated a plan to get away. Together Chase and Tar'ja followed Deidra who motioned for her, not Chase, to follow.
Offering his left arm for Tar'ja, Chase drew his blaster, he walked to the side door. Ever vigilant he focused again on the Force. Using the seriousness of the situation to fuel his determination to make sure he and his friends get out of here without anymore trouble.
He lowered his voice so only the ones at the door could hear. **"Do we go for our purchase and attempt to get where we're going?"** He made sure not to use specifics just in case. He stood there with Tar'ja ready to go on the signal.

At Deidra`s signal for the droid to stand by the comm goes dead, cut off at the droids end. Confused and now with more questions then answer the only thing that is crystal clear is your eminent danger at the hands of the ever closing empire. Without question your group rises and sets for the side door Kasga already holding it open.
Chase pauses slightly just at the side door. Clarity hits the jedi a rarity given his rudimentary training. For a moment Chase gets a powerful insight into the feelings of everyone inside the cantina. Though this is a minor breck through into Chase`s self study he almost wishes it never happened. The patrons are curious, a little excited but mostly fearful. Fear grips them all and they hold to that feeling so strongly as to feel disgust for the human jedi, they would harm you if they thought they could.
With everyone outside a blast of hot blowing wind assaults your group as the storm continues to rage on. You are forced to shield your eyes as the blowing sand attacks every inch of exposed skin. Tar`ja instinctively hugs the far wall gaining some comfort with the shadows provided by the buildings high walls.
Kasga forces the side door closed with a thump, to your sides visibility has been reduced even the streets are hard to make out now. Soon the troopers will be inside the cantina and even the alley will no longer be safe. It is doubtful that the patrons inside would keep to themselves about your recent skirmish with the Gran merc`s, right or wrong the troopers would not care who shoot at who first.

Seemingly at Kasga's unwarranted anger they began to move out the door. As he helped Tar'ja along something forced him to stop and look back. It was only for a second but as he did so the force hit him like a rampaging speeder truck. With that quick look an instant a rare clarity came into being, he clearly saw into the emotions of all the cantina's patrons. It was then that he wished that it hadn't happened.
Curiosity, excitement, and an overwhelming sense of fear. Fear seemingly so strong that it felt as if it swayed those that didn't feel the same. That fear twisted into disgust for him. The foreboding feeling that if he had been alone they would have tried to hurt him or worse
His head hung as he turned about his arm still offered to Tar'ja but right then he didn't even know if she still held on to it. The fear of the patrons was still with him as he looked at Deidra. The feelings that he felt from her were very similar to inside the cantina. ***Is this what I am to face along every step of the way, from strangers and friends alike? Distrust, fear, even hatred towards me for what I am and what I can do?***
The others may not have noticed the change in his demeanor due to the raging winds and stinging sand as hands and arms were used to protect the face and eyes. For the moment he just followed the others wondering just how he would fit into this group. His thoughts still reeling from the tremendous blow that the Force had clued him into. ***Why now? Why show me now?***

At Kasgas admonition to the more vocal of the group Naryen follows him into the alley, stumbling face first into a dirt squall. The sand was blasting away against her hood & face covering as she pulls it into place and positions her goggles but not before some grit gets in her eye, which she imediately removes. Having to change her line of sight she sees Tar'ja taking sensible cover from the storm to one side. She gives her a once-over to see if she is still favouring her injured side. ***If only I had time to see to her properly.***
Thankful for the attire against the storm Naryen was quite consious of the problem with blasting sands and looked for sign of any lightning which could indicate a disruption of comm and sensor resolution. ***Here's hoping some atmosphere and grit friction will make for some static we can use.*** The face covering was starting to chafe with the grit against the sunburn under her eyes.
She moved to stand in front of Kasga moving so he could hear. **"End run out of the alley."** She motioned with her free hand, indicating exiting the end opposite of the troopers then around and out to the connected street to their exit point, as her other hand moved the face guard so she could better articulate against the wind blown debris.
Then, indicating & gesturing for Dexter, **"We need a bearing to the search area. No more delays or killings."** The last word was directed at Chase, both vocally and with body language, before she could wrangle her temper. She flinched then grimaced in frustration for have slipped like that. ***Death, conspiracies, oppressors I once called family and now a storm that will rip the flesh from my bones. The sooner I get to a sterilized ship atmosphere the better!***
She shook it off with a flash of focused determination and looked to the sensible minded Kasga to continue the momentum he established or to see if he wanted her to run with it.

Tar'ja had taken the offered arm with a faint smile, though she clung to it tightly; she was doing what she could to continue to distract her mind from the pain that was still pulsing every so often. Walking with Chase arm in his she was able to allow her mind to imagine doing the same when they're lives weren't in danger and she wasn't covered by a cloak to hide her skin...or holding a wound.
When he takes pause though she stops as well, watching his features as emotions flit over his features and into his eyes. She didn't know what he could be thinking but she had a feeling it had to do with the harsh tone and unspoken words in the body language Deidra was doing...again the woman had a name in her thoughts, strange.
Gently she gives the arm a squeeze, looking up to him to give him the smile she used just for him, hoping in some way maybe it would calm him. She may not have seen what happened, what had made the woman so upset and distrustful of him but she knew, just knew that what he did he did for them. *We all have secrets we aren't proud of…all of us have skills we don't want known, but maybe…maybe he has the better idea, get things out in the open…maybe I'll tell them when we reach the ship.* She thinks vaguely as the exit the cantina, she moving straight to the wall and to the safety and comfort of the shadows, resting herself there so her wounded arm was facing away from the wind though she couldn't stop the grimace of pain as sand bypassed her fingers to find the cracks to her wound. It stung, but she'd live.
Her lekku twitch under the cloak as the wind rushes past, it was hard to hear so she'd have to make due with signals from the others, at least she could hear Chase; well, she hoped she'd be able to. When they got to the ship, she was going to have a talk with the woman while her wound was tended to, a good opportunity now that she thought of it to ensure that she wasn't going to try and kill the Jedi. It wasn't his fault he was what he was, and he was very clearly an asset...or did she not know of the things he could do? *hm..something else to mention..*

"No killings." Chase's head turned quickly to Deidra as the words left her mouth. A look of anger splashed across his face as the words bit deep. Thought with the poor visibility he was doubtful that anyone but maybe Tar'ja would notice the look. He turned away as his mind raced. He wanted to turn around, grab the former Imperial by the arms and tell her he didn't want to kill the Gran. That while she saw the alien die there in front of her he felt it on a totally different level. Through the Force he saw the life of the Gran wink out like a star that suddenly flared brightly and then went dim. A life that he had taken.
He remembered his lessons from Master Garet. That a Jedi tries to preserve life but that some times a Jedi must also take a life to protect others. It didn't change the fact that one life was now no longer connected to the Living Force but in a sense it did. If he had acted out of anger, jealousy, rage he would have taken a step towards the dark side.
His thoughts were torn away when he felt a squeeze on his arm. Looking in that direction he saw Tar'ja looking at him. That special smile that he liked so much was there. He hadn't realized it but they had already started moving. His thought has totally consumed him and that wasn't good. And it was Tar'ja who brought him back to the here and now. Where Imperial storm troopers were advancing on their position and they had to make a quick retreat. **"I'm ok now…thanks."** He said close to Tar'ja's ear that even the raging sand storm would not have drowned his voice out.
In all reality her presence was reassuring to him. He had confided his secret to her and for the moment she had accepted him for who he was. He would have walked through a dozen storms like this for her. ***I just hope that I live through this one.*** He thought.

After everyone is through the door, Kasga forces it shut against the wind. Turning back to the crowd huddled in the alleyway, Kasga hears Deirdra's suggestion and nods quickly.
As he strides past her, he hears her question to Dexter. He calls back over his shoulder, **"We can consider a more precise course once the storm abates. Let's just try get away from here without running into more trouble."**
Following Deirda's suggestion, he leads the group down the alley away from the main street hoping to avoid attention in the warren of back alleys.
After they are some distance away, he pauses and moves back to Tar'ja. Speaking closely to her ear to be heard, he says, **"Can you guide us back to Dosenna's farm?"**

As Kasga moves past her Naryen hears, barely, Kasgas reply over the increasing roar of the wind and hiss of the high velocity sand. "We can consider a more precise course once the storm abates. Let's just try get away from here without running into more trouble."
The realization of what Kasga said hit her, mid step, and her effort to rally caused her to almost slip in the rounded grit on the ground. She caught up to him after he spoke to Tar'ja "Can you guide us back to Dosenna's farm?"
She raised her voice to carry over the increased intensity of the storm: **"Kasga! The storm is the only advantage we have. Without it it's just us against an entire Imperial Garrison and an orbiting and coordinating Star Destroyer. We need to get to the crashsite using the storm as cover or we are as good as dead as so are any survivors at best! The storm is probably why they haven't shot us from orbit already. We need to go NOW!"** She gestures again to Dexter indicating that he needs to provide direction.
Realizing what she said she reaches into her hip pouch with both hands, past her pistol, and while shielded from the sand she removes her Comms power supply. ***If that last message was a trick that should buy us a little more time and SBC can call Chase.***

Helping Tar'ja along, Chase heard the words from both Kasga and Deidra. Despite the howl of the wind and the stinging sand Deidra's words rang true. They needed this storm as cover and to get away from the Gran mercs.
He spoke as they walked. **"She's right. We can't hunker down. This is our chance to get out of here with out leaving any traces. We'd be foolish to pass it up. We need to get to the ship, it's the only way we're getting to the crash site somewhat quickly."** He hoped that clear minds would prevail or else they were going to die here on this dustball.

Tar'ja allowed herself to be walked with the group, distracting her mind with the thoughts of the storm and the sand, and keeping it from getting into her wound. "Can you guide us back to Dosenna's farm?" it was amazing how those simple words caused such a reaction from the woman coming towards her.
Both Deidra and Chase at least were in agreement this time, and not glaring at eachother. Well, Deidra would be glaring, Chase would be upset. The twi'lek shakes her head with a sigh to clear her thoughts and return to the conversation of sorts at hand. Her gaze flicks to Kasga "We need to move now, Chase and Deidra are right, the best course would be to use this storm to our advantage." She looks to the others "The sooner we finish the job, the sooner we can leave orbit and move on."
She nods to Chase to begin moving again "take us to the ship, you and Deidra know the way I hope." She glances to the quiet Dexter, deciding to not ask him as it seemed perhaps he was in shock...or something. She was leaving no room for argument in this, they would move to the ship and that was that. "Keep eyes open, I'd like to not get stuck again.."

Kasga looks confused by the direction the conversation took. Glancing around at the others, he asks,
**"What ship? I thought we were trying to get to that crash site without a ship. Did SBC find a ship that will run that blockade? Are you talking about the transport you found earlier? We'd be able to avoid being shot down because of the storm, we might even be able to run the blockade, but without shields and weapons, we will surely be caught on the other end."**

Chase shook his head as the pilot walked and talked. ***Wasn't he at the same the same meeting I was with the droid?***
**"Yes the same ship that we found at the the merchant while you were where you were. It's the best thing we got here on this planet. As far as running the blockade we'll need the hyperdrive in the ship first but merchant is working on that. So running the blockade is not an issue at the moment. And as for getting caught on the other end, I'm not a hot-shot pilot but even I know that when running from someone you don't make a straight jump to your destination. The ship is the best choice."**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-08-06 20:24:29)

Exasperated, Kasga rails, **"You don't understand. It does not matter where you jump. After you have entered hyperspace, a sensor ship can move to your exit location and find out what your destination is. The Empire can use the Holonet to alert forces near your destination. They can arrive before you and set an ambush. We are so hot, they will surely try this. If we jump again, they will follow again. Whatever ship we have needs to be able to handle the forces that will surely be at the other end."**
Kasga sighs, then continues, **"We can use that ship for the dirtside mission, but significant improvements will need to be done before we try to run that blockage. If SBC has acquired that ship, let's head there."**

While he made perfect sense Chase could tell that the pilot didn't think like the smuggler crew he had spent time with. Micro jumps were the key. Plot a short jump, exit hyperspace. Wash and repeat as many times as necessary. This way it makes it almost impossible to track a ship. It was one of the things Jensen the navigator on the *Bloodhawk* had taught him.
He nodded when Kasga finished speaking. His voice loud to be heard over the blowing winds. **"Yes the droid had acquired the ship we looked at. And yes improvements need to be made. One thing at a time I guess. Lets get to the ship."**
He looked at Tar'ja as he focused again on walking while trying not to get chewed up by the storm. **"Its not to far to the merchants. We'll be there quickly and then we'll get your arm looked at."**
He looked at Deidra. The words she had said still stung a little but it was behind him now. One thing was for sure, he wasn't looking forward to his next conversation with the woman.

Dexter follows along with the others. Still trying to calm his nerves. He remebers back to when he was in training for combat, he was cocky then so sure of himself until it came time for real combat then he froze. *"Why did I freeze up like that? I took on those two thugs before and never froze. Sue I was scared but there was something about this time that triggered that memory."* He rolls the combat over in his head like he was trained to do. He may not have been the best shot in the galaxy but his training was supposed to take over when the time came and it didn't. If he kept up this he would get someone killed, someone he cared about then he couldn't live with himself.
The storm was bad but they would get to Toydarians shop and get the ship then he could put his skills to work on the computer systems of the ship. Start to show them want he was made of. He pull his cloak tite aound him to protect him from the sand and keeps moving.

Just after Kasga closes the side door you can barely hear the mummer of the patrons as they begin to chatter about what just happened. The patrons mummer is cut short as the storm troopers enter the cantina. The cantins becomes quite then a single trooper can be heard barking out demands. "We have reports of blaster fire in the area, report what you know citizens!"
There are a few more mummers that can not be understood through the blowing sand storm. "Sir this Gran is dead sir, cut up good."
"Search the area detain these citizens for questioning!" The voice of the trooper is amplified by his internal helm speaker which adds to the devoid sense of emotion in the troopers orders.
In unison the troopers all reply "Sir yes Sir!"
Not that your group did not already have a reason to move on you enter the next street behind the cantina then turn for Fosso`s hanger. Your progress is slowed as the storm cuts your visibility to only meters ahead of you. The strong winds force your group to huddle together as you walk to keep from becoming separated. If there are others on the street you do not see any of them, in fact until you reach the area thought to be close to Fosso`s you see no one at all.
At the edge of your vision two distorted figures stand as you close in on them you notice on holds a hand out stretched. "Halt citizen this area is off limits as are all hanger ports in the city. Move along now, this is for your own safety." The trooper waves you by indicating that he wants your group to leave the area. Looking behind the two troopers you notice more figures distorted by the sand storm but walking in perfect step to each other. It is very possible they are more troopers, and with the storm it is unclear how many there could be.

*"Damn!"* Dexter thinks to himself. *"This is not one of our better days."* Dexter keeps his cloak pulled tite against the storm. If there was away to get past them without having to fight there way through them. Dexter starts to run through ideas in his head of way to get them through this. If they had areason to leave or something that would give them no other reason but to let them in. Maybe he could put his skills to use here. The sand storm would cover his appearance and he could slip into the hanger and let the others in and they could steal a ship. And blast there way out. It could work. He could pass himself off as a tech easy enuff. He starts to look around for away to sneak in sevice door anything. Also a place to hide would be great.
((Preseption +9 and when I find a place to hide Sealth + 14. Want to try to get in and pass as one of the techs and see if I can make away in for the others.))

<strong>Mos Eisley: Nothing like a good sandblasting to set the mood for a gunfight.</strong>
Naryen hears, and shares, the frustration in Kasgas voice "We've got to get out of this storm." She sees his indication of some measure of shelter "Let's get over to the lee of that building while we figure where we need to go." A nod in acknowledgment to the Duros: ***Agreed, Captain.***
She takes a single bold step towards the trooper, with her face covered by both hand and mask+goggles and bows quite histrionically to the troopers, holding her breath. ***In these conditions a raised hand acknowledging them would likely look like a raised weapon, I hope this works better.*** Standing for a brief moment, regarding them and taking in as much as she can, then moving off with her Duros saviour.
***Once again I'm liking the sense this Duros shows.*** She makes a point of enjoying a smile directed at him as a means of distracting the various emotional turmoils Chase has caused her and others. Some fatally. She smile sours somewhat.
As she walks with the group she comes up close to Dexter so he can hear her over the storm. **"When we get there,"** she indicates where Kasga has directed them **"we need to know where we are going."**

Dexter walks over with his friends to where they where all meeting tying to get some shelter from the storm. He produces the Datapad in question from his pocket and trys to sheild it from the sand. Calling up the info. "This is the general area that we where told the ship would be in." Dexter keeps where Naryen could see it. "We need a ship or some kind of transport to get out there to retrive what we need. The junk dealer has the ship but it lacks the hyperdrive and other systems that we need to make it off planet." "I will let you guys make the call on what we are to do from my actions earlier I am bowing to you on this."
Dexter didn't want to beat himself up over what had happened. They would either undestand or not. He needed to prove himself to them again and make his wroth known. "So where to next?"

Tar'ja follows the other to the small cover a bit away, listening to the others talk while her lekku twitch still beside the Jedi. She didn't like this, things were becoming far more difficult then what it should be. She looks to the others, keeping her hand to her wound to help prevent the storm getting to it.
"I can try...I do have some piloting skills though they may not be the best from this bunch. At least I can try to sneak around and find a way for us all to get to the ship." She shakes her head and sighs "How far is the crash site? I suppose if need be and it's not too far from the farm we could try to take the cart.."

<strong>Mos Eisley: Sunburns and windblown sand sting so lovely.</strong>
Naryen & Dexter, shielded somewhat from the howling sand squalls, review the mapping information. She notices, even over the distraction of the sand and noise, his speed and almost second nature comfort of how he handles the interface and data stream. As easily as someone else would use body language in a conversation or issue orders as part of a well trained combat unit.
"This is the general area that we where told the ship would be in." they adjust slightly for the wind "We need a ship or some kind of transport to get out there to retrive what we need. The junk dealer has the ship but it lacks the hyperdrive and other systems that we need to make it off planet." She nods in response and thinks to herself, ***Yes, I was there for that conversation if you recall.***
She was a little concerned with why he didn't recall her presense or conversations about it afterwards until he next spoke: "I will let you guys make the call on what we are to do from my actions earlier I am bowing to you on this." Her eyes widened as she replayed the horrible intelligence and deployment failure that was the skirmish at The Melt Down. ***He doubts himself! Of course, we are not all combat veterans or had the training to face death like that.*** She recalls how he froze up and how she did what she could to snap him out of it for the sake of the group and the moment. She was harsh but, could she have done better for him?
She finds herself staring at him briefly at a loss for how she had managed to find herself in such a situation. ***How did I, of all people, end up the psychological glue that is to keep this band of miscreants and vagrants working as a resistance cell to a corrupt military regime? Me!***
"So where to next?" His tone of looking for an opportunity to do better is unmistakable. Naryen realized that if he acted with too much enthusiasm, to make up for past mistakes, it could lead him and others to their deaths. ***I need to do something.***
She grips his shoulder to add emphasis, pulling him closer and speaking to him firmly, but cordially, over the storm. **"Sometimes to have survived is the best result one can hope for."** the tone of a smile enters her voice **"We are still here and that makes for a good day."** She adds a slight shake and a pat to the shoulder, like kindred-at-arms, for emphasis as she brings some of her training to bear and tries to make up for how she failed him at the Café. **"We're alive so you did well so you will do well again!"** She allows the sincerity to resonate in her voice for him and those around her. She meant it.
Tar'jas movements look to still be bad and, as she speaks up, he voice tilted slightly telltate that her breathing is affected by the wound to her side. "I can try...I do have some piloting skills though they may not be the best from this bunch. At least I can try to sneak around and find a way for us all to get to the ship." ***A brave one, this Twi'lek, to offer aid even though she is clearly injured. I must get a chance to see to that wound!*** Naryen hears her sigh, possibly from the effort of talking over the wind and stressing her breathe muscles around the wound. "How far is the crash site? I suppose if need be and it's not too far from the farm we could try to take the cart..."
Naryen nods to Tar'ja and turns to Chase, the edge in her voice is only partially covered. **"Call SBC, to confirm ship acquisition."** with a curt nod she turns turns, without waiting for an acknowledgement, and looks back at the PDA and judges the distance and parses the times, given what she know of the travel time she experienced with the cart and her guess of how much the beast was exerting itself and possible biomass reserves. She puts aside a mental note to brush up on domestic ecologies whenever she goes dirtside. She then judges flight times given what she knows of ships of a similar class as what they may now have access to. (((OCC: Your turn Tru)))
Something occurs to Naryen then and she turns to her Bothan agent. **"Dexter. Contact Fasso & confirm the transaction with SBC."** She can't help but focus on her breathing then. ***I hope I'm wrong*** **"and Dexter, be discrete"**

Unsure of what to do next your group pauses a moment to consider your options, only to be interrupted by the trooper once again. Waving you through the trooper states again "Move along now, move along."
Using an nearby building as partial cover from the sand storm you huddle together trying to mak esome sense of the situation. AT Deidra`s call chase opens a comm signal to the droid. "This is Chase calling SBC are you there over?"
For a moment only static then garbled but clearly the protocol driod replys." ..... SB. 54 how may I .... to you......."
The storm is affecting communications and even at this close range only part of the message comes through. It is clear that SBC has responded to Chase`s inquiry. "Have you acquired the ship as of yet? Is it ready for flight? Chase over." Dexter attempts to strengthen the signal and clear up some of the interference.
Another moment of silence most likely caused by the droid trying to piece together the gabbled message on its end. " ...... hommin... empire .... can`t lift ...... track .... from orbit .... go by .... means ..... may the forc... with yo ......" Again the message is gabbled leaving your group to try and figure out the entire message with some key fragments left out you can only hope that you get it right.

Dexter smiles at Naryen. He is glad that he is still some what valued. "I will try." He pulls out his comm link and calls Fasso. "Hello my friend has my associety been by to talk to you about that purchase we where disscussing earlier." He hides himself under his cloak sheilding himself from the sand and wind. Hopeing that eveything was ok and his friend was in good health. Waiting for Fasso's responce he stats to think about something maybe the going by gound was the best way it would be had to fly a ship in the storm and gound travel would be easier. "What if we go back to the farm and use the cart I came in to get out there. Thee beast of this world are used to the storms and there would be less to worry about breaking down on the way there." It seemed reasonable. He looks at the map he had to see if it might be posiable.

<strong>What Chase wouldn&#39;t give for a shower. Sand can get in the worst of places.</strong>
Chase Ignored the coldness of Deidra's tone as he called SBC and got the reply from the droid. Listening to the incoming message from SBC-54 as he used the building for as much cover as possible. It was pretty garbled but he believed that he got the overall meaning. He frowned a bit as he looked at the others while putting the comlink away. **"Well that pretty much settles using the ship to get to the crash site. I think SBC was saying that the orbiting empire ships will be able to track the transport from orbit and that we will have to use other means to get there."** He left out the "May the Force be with you" for Derida's sake but he was sure that she heard it.
As he spoke he did his best to lend support for his wounded friend, Tar'ja. His concern for her was growing. The wound didn't seem so bad but not being able to get it looked at and tended to could lead to other problems. Add in the fact that there was a raging sand storm just added another factor that wasn't good. He put his arm around Tar'ja. An offer to lend her some help from the buffeting winds. Not so much in support of her but for him also. They all would need each other to get out of this situation in one piece.
He looked to Dexter. **"It looks like it will have to be the beast and cart for the moment. Lets hope that Dosdenna has what we will need for protection form the storm while we travel, heavy tarps for the cart and protective gear for ourselves. We're not going to last much longer in this storm much less get there alive with out that gear. We should be able to use the data pad for the farms location in the storm so we don't get lost. It's now or never."**

With the confirmation by SBC, Kasga wastes no time, **"Well, lets get going. This storm will only get worse. I expect we want to limit our contact with Dosenna as much as possible."**
With that, he starts heading back the way the group came fighting the storm.

Dexter puts his comm link as close to where he could hear it beep and starts to follow Kasga. "We are still going to need some way to get out there. On foot is not the best idea. We might beable to use the storm to our advantage in getting the transport we need." Dexter pulls his cloak around him as tite as he can and fights the storm try to keep Kasga in site. *"This is not exactlly what I had in mind when I front got here. My insturctors are having a good laugh at my expence."* He thnks to himself as move forward.

### **master_Tru** (2009-08-19 14:29:24)

Dexter huddles within the alley and makes the call to Fosso. After another moment his comm crackles in response "Yes yes .... sell .... price very good .... bargain .... to bad ... off .... ships ..... grounded ....ave..... mor.... ell."The signal is suddenly lost in the mix of sand and wind.
Your group starts for te edge of town the streets are empty and the raging storm forces you to stay close together. At the edge of town a lone guard maintains watch over a series of monitoring systems within a dura glass booth. The sand blasts in all directions as the storm takes hold over the city without doubt hampering the effectiveness of the guards sensor array.
Chase`s comm sparks to life the droid SBC can barely be heard above the wind. "Ok .... meet you ... signal ... te ship ... look is .... Horizon Bound ... stay ... repairs ... soon." Another signal cut off and gabbled by the storm.
Out on the endless sea of sand the storm seems to have calmed some. The limited respite in the torrent of sand blast winds makes the trek to the farm house much easier. Dosenna must have been expecting your group, the farm lights are on guiding you in. As you approach the small home you can see Dosennaa herself welcoming you wit open arms. "Ah welcome back." Behind her you can tell that the orphanage is in quite mode the children put to sleep out the storm. Beside the short furry woman is a pile of supplies, a skin tent, food water, a few glow rods and some animal feed. Behind her the cart sits ready to go.
"Please be careful in the sand waste many creatures use these storms to hunt. Very dangerous to be out in them, do come back safely." The little Bimm seems very concerned for all of you.

<strong>Mos Eisley: Sunburns and windblown sand sting so lovely.</strong>
Naryens face is starting to burn. As much as she's tried to keep the grit from her face, and her unfamiliarity with the gear, it's still managing to irritate her sunburn. ***Oh what I wouldn't give for a little time on the southern glacier back home!*** She coughs, lightly, from the grit behind her facemask. She tried removing a small amount earlier but the wind increased it's volume ten fold and she has no doubt it would happen again if she tried. The mask seems to be removing it on it's own but slowly. Annoyingly.
She hears SBC echo her warning about Imperial force effectiveness. She wasn't familiar with the storm composition here but drawing on the droids experience it seems that it's not enough to get in the way of Imperial efficiency & determination. ***Irony.***
Naryen hears Chase provide his opinion over the howling winds and hiss of the sand "Well that pretty much settles using the ship to get to the crash site. I think SBC was saying that the orbiting empire ships will be able to track the transport from orbit and that we will have to use other means to get there." Her eyes bulge. Did he not recall her saying virtually the same thing earlier? Naryens mouth tightens as she turns away from Dexter to look at Chase again.
"It looks like it will have to be the beast and cart for the moment. Lets hope that Dosdenna has what we will need for protection form the storm while we travel, heavy tarps for the cart and protective gear for ourselves. We're not going to last much longer in this storm much less get there alive with out that gear. We should be able to use the data pad for the farms location in the storm so we don't get lost. It's now or never." Naryen blinks at him at a loss.
Kasga speaks up with his typical directness, a welcome "Well, lets get going. This storm will only get worse. I expect we want to limit our contact with Dosenna as much as possible." With that, he starts heading back the way they came. As Naryen falls in line with Kasga she looks back to Tar'ja, without a word in response to Chase. ***I hope that his view of her will be other than disposable like that of the Gran at the bar.*** Her sight lingers for a moment on Tar'ja. Seeing the two of them covering each other she looks back to Dexter.
"... still going to need some way to get out there. On foot is not the best idea. We might beable to use the storm to our advantage in getting the transport we need." Naryen blinks ***…Did he call Fasso?*** She shrugs and considers that there's not much to do now. Losing each other under these conditions would likely be fatal. She makes whatever final adjustments she can think of with her attire and sets in stride next to the determined Durros. She considers in silence ***Is the only cart and gear we have access to at the farm?*** She considers as much as she'd like to see Lahela again her desire to see that wonderous little person seems selfish and risky to the child. A ray of hope that the Galaxy can endure the Empire.
As they pass a guard post, at the edge of town, Naryen sees a lone operator struggle with garbled displays. ***Not Imperial standard.*** She has a smug feeling enter then exit her mind like an unwanted guest, leaving a bitter sentiment in its wake.
Chase`s comm sparks to life the droid SBC can barely be heard above the wind. "Ok .... meet you ... signal ... te ship ... look is .... Horizon Bound ... stay ... repairs ... soon." Another signal cut off and gabbled by the storm. ***Seems that he's staying with the ship but the mention of repairs seems off. The ship looked to be in working order.***
The storm lightens enough to make out a guide light at the farm. A nice gesture for wanderers in this mess as we are. Naryen is suprised to see Dosennaa herself seemingly waiting for them "Ah welcome back." Behind her Naryen sees that the farm is closed down, likely to wait out the storm. Beside the short furry woman is a pile of supplies, a skin tent, food water, a few glow rods and some animal feed. Behind her the cart sits ready to go. "Please be careful in the sand waste many creatures use these storms to hunt. Very dangerous to be out i them, do come back safely." The little Bimm seems very concerned. ***She was expecting us?***
Naryen looks thoughtfully at the gear then to Kasga and Dexter, a glance to indicate *you should get started on that*, then steps up to Dosennaa, moving her mask and goggles to give her face a much needed and enjoyed cleaning. **"We are grateful for this and so much more."** Her voice and expression resonate sincerity to the generous little woman. **"Tar'ja has been injured, can you see to her quickly while we prep the cart?"** She moves some grit from her eyes **"The wound, no doubt, needs to be cleaned and properly covered before she can leave with us."** She looks to the Twi'lek but leans into the Bimms side, resisting the urge to hug her, so as to make like she's confiding but leaves her voice the same so that Tar'ja can overhear. With a smile she says **"She may be more injured than she's letting on."** She finishes adjusting her gear. **"If you could spare a moment to show us use of the gear I'd appreciate it and…"** She suddenly looks very shy and small **"are the children awake?"** She's looking down at the ground, fiddling with her hands she realizes how much she wants to see Lahela.

Tar'ja walked in silence beside Chase, idly listening to the bits of conversations, watching the emotions play out on the woman's face and wonder about the turn of events. True she hadn't see the Jedi fight, but surely whatever it was that he had done shouldn't be so bad as to make the woman so...irritated at him...was it?
Her musings of the relationships of their little band and the trust issues that are apparent make her sigh, she had decided to tell them at least a little of her own past, if only to make Chase feel better, better to have two people share the irritations of others then alone, besides, it would come out sooner or later.
The farm was a welcome sight, her hand clenching against her wound in anticipation, hope oddly filling her at the prospect of seeing her little one again but it cooled when she noticed how quiet it all seemed inside, odd how just the simple thought of not seeing the little one..hurt. Very strange.
The bothan woman was waiting for them, strange, were they expected to come this way? no matter, it seemed things were ready at least. Now that there was something to block the force of the storm even slightly, the twi'lek moves into the cover slightly, enough to remove her hand and still listen to the woman and bothan speak "Tar'ja has been injured, can you see to her quickly while we prep the cart? The wound, no doubt, needs to be cleaned and properly covered before she can leave with us."
Her lekku and eye twitched "I'm fine, I can manage if I bind it at the least." Honestly did she seem to be so fragile that a simple blaster wound, though hurting immensely...it was hurting wasn't it? or had her body tuned the pain out...hm. She looks about for some cloth to tear and make a make-shift covering, treatment honestly, she didn't need it she was fine! "She may be more injured than she's letting on." Again her eye twitched as she looks now to the woman "I'm fine." she mutters through clenched teeth.
She would have continued but the rest caught her attention, the simple question asking if the children were awake was enough to bring that little hope back, maybe she could see her little one again..

Dexter was glad to here from Fasso about the ship. At least that part was going right. As they get to the farm Dexter is surprised that Dosenna had everything ready for them. *"Must have SBC's doing. I guess he is watching out for us."* Dexter thinks to himself. "Well I guess from what I got from Fasso that everything is fine, and they should have everything ready when we need it." Dexter shakes himself trying to get what sand he can out of his fur. "So I guess we head out and see if our luck holds out." He did like the idea of head out into the storm again but it was what was needed and that was the mission need all of them to do there part. He pulls out his blaster and checks it to make sure it is ready in case he needs it again. "Man I really starting to dislike sand. It will take me forever to get it out of my fur." Dexter smiles as he says it. The rest where probably getting just as tried of it.

Standing out in the storm was getting irritating and it wasn't just the sand as Deidra continued to be curt with him. Not to mention the stares of disbelief when he now spoke. He simply shook his head as a second message came over his comm from SBC. This one further cemented that they were now doing the search without the ship. This time he kept his opinion to himself in an attempt to not provoke any more stares of disbelief from Nayren. When Kasga, the ever pragmatic one, spoke on moving out Deidra's look was almost one of relief. like she just didn't hear what he had just said moments before. This whole trust issue was getting out of hand. Something had to be done about it and soon.
Despite the wickedness of the storm Chase took comport in being close to Tar'ja. If he had known how he would have healed her like he'd seen Master Garet perform on others before. Unfortunately his training hadn't progressed that far. While he was very proficient with the use of a lightsaber, he had no mastery of any of the many different Force powers. ***That would be a good one to know though. Some way I'll figure it out.***
The storm was relentless but as they came closer to the farm he noticed like the others that the farm light was on. They homed in on it like a dung bug on a bantha poodoo. A smile crossed his lips as he saw Dosenna welcome them in. It was eerie quiet and the children must have been sleeping. He spotted the pile of supplies and listened to her words of warning. Looking at the others he saw the surprise on their faces as well as felt it on his own face.
He listened as Deidra went on to explain that Tar'ja had been injured and that she needed to be looked after. Due to his arm being around her he flet her lekku twitch. He had begun to notice that whenever an emotion hit her it often caused her lekku to twitch.
The tone in her voice confirmed it. "I'm fine, I can manage if I bind it at the least." Tar'ja had said and he would have sworn that she stood a little taller when she said it. Deidra continued on about her condition.
"I'm fine." Chase heard the Twi'lek mutter through clenched teeth. He decided to remove his arm from the ever increasingly irritated Twi'lek as he set his duffel down beside him and then brushed what sand he could off his body. He heard Deidra ask if the children were awake which also caught Tar'ja's attention.
He looked at Dex as he spoke again. "Man I really starting to dislike sand. It will take me forever to get it out of my fur." The Bothan said with a smile. Chase smiled back. ***That's the Dexter we know. a little more light hearted.***
He looked back to Tar'ja as he shifted his duffel. Genuine concern was in his eyes and voice. **"Tar'ja I get the feeling that you'd rather just wrap it up and get going but it should be looked at. At least quickly, to clean it and put a proper bandage on. If you let me do it I'll be a quick as possible with no fussing."** He nodded. ***Although a bit of fussing might be fun.*** He thought. After he spoke he realized that he may have let more of how he felt about her slip out with his tone. The truth be told that while he did care about her he wanted to make sure that she wasn't hindered when they went back out into that forsaken sand storm. They would all need to be in top form.

Tar'ja's eye was twitching again as the concern for her arm was brought up and was about to round on the person when recognition kicked in, it was Chase that was asking. Her lips thin into a straight line as she ponders what to do, she didn't want a fuss, she just wanted to get the blasted mission out of the way and that was it.
Her lekku rise then lower as she turns her arm to him "Fine. Just...be quick..." She glances over to the woman, hopefully it would appease the woman and maybe even calm her about the Jedi if he tended the wound. "Just. A bandage. I can manage with just that."
She had been wondering and pondering during their walk how best to breach what she wanted to tell them, waiting for the right moment had crossed her mind but was there ever a right moment for that information? She had decided to just say it but when? there? now? what if the little ones entered...that wouldn't be good she wouldn't want them to know. She lets out a sigh as her eyes look away from the wound and treatment to ponder the wall.

Tar'ja rounded on him quickly as he spoke to her about her arm. He wasn't sure if she was gong to hit him or just stand there looking at him. Her lips were in a straight line across with no hint of a smile. He tucked that expression away into the back of his mind one to remember for the future.
He looked at her as she held out her arm. The sand from the storm was still whipping around thought not as bad. **We'll have to do this inside."** He looked to Dosenna and smiled at teh little Bimm. **"May we go inside so I can look at her arm? We'll be quiet I promise."** He waited for her answer before proceeding.

Walking through town, Kasga grits his teeth against the constant scouring of the sandstorm. *I hate dirtballs, this trip has been just one carbon flush after another. Why can't get back into the big empty where all I have to worry about is whether my hull is leaking*
Kasga makes no comment on the commcalls, but files the ship's identity away with all the others he's known over the years. *Repairs, I wonder what SBC has in mind.*
Speaking aloud, Kasga ponders,**"I wonder if we can salvage it's transponder. That might keep our new ship's transponder in the clear for a bit longer."**
Having arrived at the farm with the others, Kasga's gaze wanders over to the abandoned speeder bike obscured by the blowing sand. Half buried in a drift of sand, it looks like ancient derelict. *It really wasn't that damaged. Blast, what I wouldn't do to be riding that about now.*
As Chase and Tar'ja debate her blaster bolt injury, Kasga interjects, **"We will be away from medical supplies for a while and in very unsanitary conditions. While I feel a sense of urgency, I feel we should do as much as we can before we leave, even if there is more delay."**

"I think the longer we wait the less likely are chances are. The storm is the perfect cover for what we are going to do." Dexter busys himself with finishing what is needed with the cart and supplies. "If we could secure more medical supplies. It might give away what we are doing and atract attention that we don't want or need." Dexter checks over the supplies that had been brought for them. "If we slip out now we have cover and surprise on our side." Dexter hopes that his friends understood what he ment. He and a injuried man made it this far why couldn't they. "So we going or staying, those are the choices."

Chase looked from Kasga to Dexter. Kasga made a good point with no medical supplies and the conditions they would be traveling in seeing to the would would be best. Thay already had Tar'ja's approval now they just needed Dosenna's approval .
He looked back to the little Bimm as Dex started making the cart ready and added in his thoughts also. The Bothan made good points but Chase wasn;t sure that he was following Kasga's line of thought correctly. He shook his head slightly. **"Dexter, I could be wrong but I don't think Kasga's talking about securing medical supplies for the mission. Her wound needs to be treated before it gets infected and becomes a problem that a medkit can't handle. Besides treating it would only take a matter of minutes. Plenty of time to make the cart and supplies ready for travel. A delay of a few minutes isn't going to see the cover of this storm blow away."**
He looked at the Bothan. **"We're going but her arm is getting looked at, before we leave. I would be pushing for this if it was anyone of you who were hurt."** There was a subtle seriousness to his tone that wasn't hard to pick up on.

Dexter looks at Chase then at Dosenna, then to the others. Lowering his head. "Sorry I guess I miss understood what Kasga was saying. Of course we should treat her wounds." Dexter goes back to checking the cart and making sue everything in ready to go. He looks over at Dosenna and smiles. "Thank you for the supplies. I hope we have not cause you or the childern to become wrapped up in all of this. I would hate to see harm come to any of you." He hands her a data card. "This has my comm signal and scrambler code on it. There is also another way to contact me if you need to though my superiors if you need anything please contact me." Deterr quickly returns to readying the cart.

When Chase clarifies his own statement, Kasga murmers, **"That's right."** That task having been picked up by Chase, Kagsa looks after them for a moment before turning toward the preparations for the journey ahead.
*There go the two more competent of us. Ok, at least these two should be able to perform since we're not currently under fire.*
Keeping his thoughts out of his voice, Kasga asks Deirdra and Dexter, **"Do either of you know preparations for deep desert travel? Most of my planetside training was on how to live long enough to get back off."**

*Ah, the plan. Get a ship and burn skies.*
Kasga grimaces against the flying grit of the sandstorm. Speaking loudly, he responds, **"The Empire will resume aerial patrols as soon as they can after the storm breaks. We need to be away from here. When they spot us next, we need to look like a bunch of locals travelling across the desert. It would be good if we could travel on a bearing toward our ultimate goal, but I think dropping off the radar is more critical right now. Once the storm breaks, we can reassess our direction and make it more precise. If we can camoflage the cart a bit, it could help us later."**

Deter thinks over what Kasga has said. "Hmm. Would take much. Not that the cart doesn't look like any other that might be crossing the desert. But a little there it might look like it belongs." Dexter goes to wrok trying to figure out what to do, and what might work. " I should mention that before I arrived here at the farm. I was over flown by some Ties. I don't think they paid attention to us, but might be something to keep in mind." Dexter continues with his work trying to make the cart look it part."

Dosenna gently pushes Tar`ja just inside the farm house door "Oh be quite child with your fussing and let me look at that." The short Bimm woman is firm in her resolve but gentle with her touch. "I told you to be careful, if you women go down who will take care of the men in your group, tell me that will you?" Dosenna checks over the wound then begins to rip strips off her yellow dress. Binding the wound tightly she applies some ointment to the area as well. "This should do so long as you don`t stop anymore blaster shots with your body that is. Please be more careful." ((9hp back))
Together you gather the supplies and load the crude repulsor cart. The dewback protests as the sands blow around it letting out a low roar. Dosenna helps your group as you load the cart, "I would say set the skin tent up on top of the cart to allow so form of protection from the storm. It is not much but better then nothing."
Dexter shakes his mane letting some sand lose from his fur then looks around for more materials to add to the cart finding a few scraps of metal. The worn out speeder bike has some paneling as well that might add some more protection. With the skin tent set up and the supplies protected within Dosenna says her farewells hugging each of you. "The children would have liked to see you all off, but we put them to bed to sleep out the storm. In the morning they will need their strength for the clean up.
Dosenna looks at your group holding back a tear "The children and I would like very much to see you all again, please be careful out there." With a hug to each of you the little Bimm waves good bye as your group heads into the desert.
Around you the storm rages on but the skin tent provides protection from the blasting sands. The twin suns overhead shinning through the raging sand storm give off a slightly orange haze which turns dark as you look towards the city as if the worse of it was hanging directly over town.
With only minimal direction you are able to lead the dewback from inside the skin tent. The cart makes slow but steady progress through the storm. As you continue the storm does not let up, the winds build in strength pushing hard against the cart. After several hours of progress light can be seen in the distance. As you near the lights you begin to worry that you might have circled around back to town or the farm.
With the winds now forcing the cart side to side slowing your progress you begin to think that some shelter might be a good idea if only to allow the dewback a rest. Heading for the lights you notice the lights are coming from two large rectangular sand vehicles. They are parked at the side of a sheer cliff face. You can see that the vehicles are tracked and that more lights can be seen coming from the rock face as well, possibly caves inside.
Again the winds push against the cart tearing a new hole in the animal skin tent. Sand begins to pile inside where the hole has opened. The large vehicles tower overhead, on the sides weather worn and tan. The tracked sand crawlers look ancient the manufacture possible long forgotten.

### **ganthet** (2009-08-25 14:16:57)

Dexter looks at the Sand crawlers they could be the shelter they were needing. Though the lights might mean life. Looking over at the others. "What you think? Good place to stop and make repairs?" Dexter motions to the sand crawlers.

### **galenbd** (2009-08-26 11:05:27)

Things have been quiet during the trek. *Sleep is a weapon. I might as well take a nap.* Kasga gets relatively comfortable and slips into a light doze.
When the others start stirring upon sighting the Sandcrawlers, Kasga rouses. Shielding his eyes, he looks out into the still aggressive storm. Taking in the newly available shelter, he says, **"We've made good progress. I too think we should stop."**
As he settles back into the cart, Kasga gripes, **"I expect we will have to negociate for water and food. I suggest minimal contact and try not to give away out destination or plans again."**

Tar'ja had given minimal fuss when the woman had ushered her inside and tended to her arm. True she had been grumbling about it softly but she had kept it minimal. When it was finally over and the twi'lek was once again able to move her arm more easily and as well have her other hand back her relief was short lived at the news the children were asleep. She hadn't realized how much she had wanted to see her little one again until then.
She had been quiet though the majority of the ride, her thoughts still dwelling on the news she wanted to reveal to the others but still debating on how to go about it. All the same though she leaned against the one that was beside her, namely Chase naturally.
She gave a faint sigh on occasion with her thoughts, her eyes slipping closed and slipping to a light dose, it was a mission though and thus she didn't fall into a full sleep, needing to be somewhat alert still. Thus she was awoken every so often by noises of the wind and sand, shifting against her human pillow to get more comfortable and thus resting more against him, her hands moving slowly to rest one in her lap and the other on his leg.
Again though her sleep was interrupted this time by stirrings of the others, and looking out to the disturbance, having to half lean over the human beside her to do so she see's the dark shapes ahead that had gotten the fuss of the others.
"We've made good progress. I too think we should stop. I expect we will have to negotiate for water and food. I suggest minimal contact and try not to give away out destination or plans again." Kasga's voice broke through the howl of the wind. Turning her head first to look to Chase, now a faint pink at the proximity and returns to her seat beside him looking then to the other "I agree. It would be best to make a few repairs and let the beasts rest a short time. How close are we to the crash site?"

Dexter pulls out the data pad with the map on it and looks to see if he can figure out where they are. "Give me a minute and I will try to figure that out." Looking the map over. "Ya we have made some good time on this trip. It seems the galaxy is with us for now. Of course considering recent events, I would say it was about time." Dexter smiles at his last statement. He hopes that storm would not interfere with the information that was needed to figure out where they where at.

### **Yogi** (2009-08-27 13:11:37)

Chase gave a little smile as Dosenna took Tar'ja by the arm and gently led her into the farm house all the while telling her not to fuss. The look on the Twi'leks face showed the underlying grumbling that she wanted to let out but she kept it in. Chase gave her credit for that. Tar'ja was a tough independent person from what he could tell. Being doted on must be something difficult to deal with.
With his friend being taken care of Chase helped out with taking care of the cart and beast. Moments later the two exited the farm house. Chase looked at Tar'ja, even thought she still had that look on her face from being fussed over he still thought she was beautiful. It was with that thought he knew that he was in trouble. With a sigh, that was an unworthy attempt to put that thought out of his mind he looked at her arm. He noticed the yellow strips of cloth that were now bound around the blaster would. Chase realized it was the same fabric and color of Dosenna's dress.
With some direction from Dosenna they got the repulsor cart ready for their trip into the deep desert. With the tent and metal scraps settled in they looked the part of scavengers. Hopefully it would fool any of the over flights that may see them.
With the news of the children all off to bed to sleep out the storm Chase made a grimace. He would have liked to seen some of them. He had had quite a bit if fun playing with them but it was important that they get their sleep. He looked at Tar'ja and saw the look of disappointment on her face. He smiled and said softly to her. **"I'm sure that we'll be able to see her on the way back. Hopefully we won't be too long out there."**
With a quick good bye and a hug from the little Bimm they all loaded in. Chase sat down near the reigns of the beast. **"We can take turns if everyone is fine with that?"**
He had made himself comfortable as Tar'ja sat down next to him. Actually very close to him that it was almost surprising. **"You ok?"** he asked her quietly. She didn't actually answer him with any words. She just sat quietly and leaned against him. With Tar'ja comfortably resting against him he also realized how tired he was. With the quick but intense fight back at the cantina and the successful mind trick on the trooper back at Fosso's he was ready for some down time. As the cart started he looked at the others. **"Wake me in an hour or two and I'll take over the reigns."** He shifted a little as to get more comfortable resulting in Tar'ja shifting as well leaning more into him. He put his left arm around the Twi'lek and dozed off.
Even though his rest was disturbed by the storm, the repulsor cart and the straining of the beast he managed to get some rest. One such time he awoke he felt that Tar'ja had basically snuggled into him and he her. One of her hands rested on his leg. Smiling at the feeling that it rose in him he let his right hand cover hers and held it snugly. It was a nice feeling holding on to her. One that he regretted that would end soon. It did end when he awoke to her half leaning over him. ***This is nice.*** He thought but then came fully awake as he had heard the talking about what they had come up upon. He had fallen into a deeper sleep than he had wanted to and regretted it.
Looking outside he took in what the others had saw and were talking about as Tar'ja sat back down leaning against him again as she spoke. "I agree. It would be best to make a few repairs and let the beasts rest a short time. How close are we to the crash site?"
He had never seen vehicles of this sort before. It was as if they were made for this planet, large and tracked, to make sand wastes easier to travel.
Right on que Dexter had the data pad out. Chase gave a quick nod on the quickness of the Bothan as he looked it over. **"Ya we have made some good time on this trip. It seems the galaxy is with us for now. Of course considering recent events, I would say it was about time."** He said with a grin.
**"Ok then."** Chase said. **"Repairs and rest the beast it is. Who wants to go and greet those that probably know we're here?"** He looked at Deidra. Who seemed to be avoiding his gaze. He could sense the pent up emotions inside the woman. Sooner or later is was going to explode out of her.

### **Rebaav** (2009-08-27 14:59:47)

**Travelling through a desert on Tatooine during a sandstorm&#8230; you heard me.**
Naryen was disapointed to hear that she couldn't see Laehla again but felt it was for the best. She nods in acknowledgement and with a resigned expression watches Dossana skillfully tend to Tar'ja, not hiding her smirk as the Twi'lek accepted help. Naryen smiles at Dossanas request that Tar'ja try not to stop blaster shots with her body in the future.
((OOC: Treat Injury check to watch her expertise and offer any assistance if needed. Since Doessana has been here much longer than her or the rest of her group it didn't occur to Naryen to ask how she knew they would on the way for supplies. Must be contacts & networking well established and secure otherwise they would be dead by now... and so would the PCs.))
She notes, with a smile, the conversation between Dexter and Kasga as they set to the cart. Naryen thinks ***Probably best If I leave them to that.*** as she tends to the creature that she hears one of the others identify as a Dewback. She feeds and strokes it to calm it as the cart it's attached to is worked over, unsure if it should be uncoupled in a storm. Glancing at Chase, as he steps into the the conversation between Dexter and Kasga, Naryen is once again taken aback by her conflicted and intense feelings towards the man. The slight and soft hairs on the back of her neck scratch at the inside of her shirt like a starved animal batting feebly at it's cage. ***I need to watch him more closely for my own peace of mind if nothing else.***
Looking at him, through the now much calmer blown sand, she recalls how casually he ended a life, in front of her, with his Jedi training. Being so clearly a superior force to those he faced, positioned such that his presence was of clearly significant tactical advantage, and to then have used such overwhelming physical and psychological force to subdue then kill a retreating opponent!... The wave of rage threatened to surface again. The feeling of having been manipulated, again, by someone in a position of authority touched upon every part of her mind. Warring with that was the feeling of somehow being personally gulible even in the face of an entire planetary systems population having the same failing.
The dewback made a sound, half grunt half hiss, providing a welcome distraction from her inner turmoil. She jerked slightly at the noise and, speaking soothingly to it, returned her attention to the creature with more focus as much to relax herself as the beast of burden. **"You'd run off and seek shelter from this storm, like a sensible animal, if I uncoupled you from the cart while we worked on it, wouldn't you."** Rubbing it slowly behind it's head and mimics the sounds it makes as best she can **"Shusssh now, we'll be going soon."**
As they finish up the cart and Dossonna bids them a farewell that effects Naryen deeply, the expression plain on her face, they set out with minimal conversation. They settled into a rotations of 1 resting 2 watching for the predators Dossana had mentioned and one at the reins with the PDA held by the 5th as they went. Naryen focussed on her tasks as much as she could, not looking at Chase for the trip. The rocking was starting to irritate more than her sand-chaffed sunburn but she made sure to not sit too close to him but keep him in view when she could. She spared the occasional smile of comraderie where she could to Tar'Ja. ***Perhaps you are more sensible than I and simply take him as he is rather than what he tries to appear to be.***
Eventually a pair of large, back-lit, tracked vehicles show stowed & sheilded from the sand against an excavated cliffside came into view through the sand. Though they seem to have had their share of sand exposure given the errosion on their outer surfaces their construction spoke of rugged durability from the ages ***Now there's a sign of some experience with sandstorms. I wish we could afford the stop to talk with them…*** As if on some pre-arranged cue, a blast of wind opened a tear in the skin cover and the cart rocked far more violently as the coverings acted like chute. ***… or it's time for a break.***
The conversation in the cart, then, suggested the same thing was aparant to the others. Naryen heard "How close are we to the crash site?" and she looked to Dexter for the answer.
"What you think? Good place to stop and make repairs?" Dexter motions to the sand crawlers.
As the howling, now significanty louder in the cart, brought with it a rapidly expanding dune of sand Naryen called back. **"No choice. We can't continue like this."** And motions the Dewback forward towards the end of one of the sand crawling vehicles, looking for shelter where they can assess and repair. The noise made it almost impossbile to hear conversation at a normal volume.
***I hope these people are receptive to suprise guests.*** A feeling itching at the back of her mind, probably related to her experiences in the past few days, suggested likely not. She sets her jaw as she directs the dewback foward to some shelter from the winds where they can get a better view of the cart and where they are.
((OOC I had this already ready earlier but got delayed. Edited for, in some cases a total lack of, grammer.))

### **master_Tru** (2009-08-28 12:18:35)

Dexter checks over the data pad while trying to use the Cliff as a point of reference. After few moments the Bothan smiles realizing that with his best guess they have just entered the imperial search grid as indicated but the dotted lines on the map.
Between the two sand crawlers diminutive brown robed aliens welcome you group in. Though you do not understand their language they make it clear that trade is their game. Inside the two sand crawlers provide much protection from the blowing sand storm. Along the Cliff face you can see a multi leveled networking of caves. Looking in at the ground level you can see dozens of stands many carved into the stone walls. On various tables and hanging from every available spot the Jawas ply their trade. Items of most every make design and purpose can be seen, though most in disrepair.
Jawa`s themselves are known to many travelers. Known for their love of trade, good deals and known for their smell. Even within the drafty tunnels the stories of the Jawa odor is not given justice, and their numbers alone add to that fact.
Rows and rows of Jawa merchants shout their wares with as many Jawa browsing the tables. Dim lights line the tunnel walls but you can see that this Jawa yard sale extends deep into the Cliff rock.
Inside the network of tunnels you are provided ample room to park your cart. The dewback slumps to the sand floor much more exhausted then it let on. It was common knowledge that the beasts could work themselves to death.
Other similar carts and vehicles are also parked within. Most owned by Jawa merchants and scavengers having traveled here for the swap meet. Though a few other traders have come as well.

### **Yogi** (2009-08-31 00:16:53)

Chase watched as the cart and beast entered into a more protective area that is provided bu the two massive tracked vehicles and the cliff face. As visibility became better Chase looked out the flap of the skin tent. The sand wasn't blowing around in the protected area and he had a good view of the area.
He looked at Deidra and saw her advert her gaze again. ***Watching me like a mynock looking at a power coupling.*** He thought as he gave a simple smile in her direction. ***She was already teetering on the edge back at Fosso's. Did the fight at the Cafe send her over?*** He shook his head.
As much as he liked his position next to Tar'ja he shifted to his knees to get a better look. The area was actually busy. From the dozens of stands to the caves that littered the cliff face there was lots of activity from Jawa to other scavengers alike. He looked back into the cart. **"Lots going on here. If we're going to fix this hole in the tent We'll find the way here.** As he spoke a subtle gust of wind blew the area fragrance into the tent. Chase closed his eyes and looked away from the opening. ***Wow. I remember the crew on the Bloodhawk joking about the smell of a Jawa but I didn't imagine it was really that bad.*** Chase thought to himself.
Once inside the tunnels and parked Chase heard the beast collapse. He sat back down next to Tar'ja again and looked around. **"Ok fix the tent and tend to the beast. Maybe Dosenna packed something in the gear she gave us."** Chase reached for the gear and began to go over it. He spoke as he looked. **"I'll stay here with the cart if that's what's best. After the cafe it might be best if I don't interact much in case word has already gotten out."** It was only hours after the fight but word of a Jedi spreads fast.
It was the first anyone of them had spoken about what had happened in the cafe. A look of disappointment came over his face. The merc was dead. It wasn't murder but in defense of his friends. Would they see it that way? Chase doubted Deidra did or would. He already knew that her indoctrination by the Empire was total. Would she be able to get past what he was? He simply sighed. He should have been able to alter his swing but he didn't expect the Gran to run for the exit like he did. It's path took it right into his return swing. The strike ended up being fatal.

Tar'ja watches the human beside her move to follow the movements outside, looking over his shoulder from her seat as the area came into view, her lekku giving a twitch at the sound of the beast collapsing in a rest, but her eyes cross as her body sways at the smell that wafts into the tent.
She moves a hand to her mouth and nose, covering it as she gives a shudder at the scent. She looks over as the human sits down again and begins to look through the gear that was given to them, "I'll stay here with the cart if that's what's best. After the cafe it might be best if I don't interact much in case word has already gotten out." Tar'ja raises her head and uncovers her mouth and nose "I'll stay with him, moving the cloak from her arm to remind them all of her coloring "after that broadcast of my picture I shouldn't be seen."

As the cart comes in closer to the sandcrawlers, Kasga clamped down his olfactory glands. He'd been on Tantooine long enough to know what Jawas smelled like.
Chase and Tar'ja seem inclined to hide in the cart. *Frankly, we all should. Still, we need food*
Kasga speaks up. **All of us are known. But we need supplies, so I'll go. At least then I don't have to worry about giving away information. I know we need food and water. What else do we need to try and find? A toolkit?**

I don't think credits are going to do use a lot of good out here." Dexter puts away the data pad and looks over the cart. "I can start working on the cart if you guys want to figure out the next move." Pulling out his tool kit he beings trying to make what ever repairs he can to the cart and the tent on top of it.

When Tar'ja mentioned staying behind also a sudden hope of being alone with the beautiful Twi'lek, even if it was only going to be for a short time, on a repulsor cart that was in some smelly cave, swept through his mind. That hope was wiped away when Dexter began to work on the cart.
Chase was surprised when Dexter seemed to pull out his toolkit right after Kasga mentioned if they needed one and set to work on the tent. He caught the language comment just after Kasga did. He knew he didn't speak the language and wondered if any of the others did. Kasga's confirmation made it three out of five.
Chase shook his head. **"I don't but I don't think it would be too hard. If we see something we want we can offer something for it. Yes and no shouldn't be too hard to figure out. A couple of you must have heard those words before."** 
Chase looked over the items again. **"You know Dex some mesh tape would work well for that tear in the tent. Maybe she packed some in here."**
He then looked at Kasga. **"All my credits went for the ship's holding fee. I don't have much but I can offer this."** He reached into his bag and a second later pulled free his stun baton. **"It isn't much but we might be able to get something for it."**
OOC: Looking over the goods Dosenna packed for anything useful. ie. mesh tape and such. Perception +9 if needed.

Kasga looks skeptical. He says, **"Maybe. I guess we can try with gestures and the like."**
Chase brings out his stun baton. Kasga quips,**"I still owe you a hundred for fronting the speeder bike we came in on."**
Kasga thinks a moment, then says,**"Everything else I had was taken, but we might already have what we need. Dexter has a toolkit which we'll need. Does anyone have food or water? Did Dosenna pack any in the cart?"**

### **master_Tru** (2009-09-02 21:38:56)

Checking through the supplies provided by Dosenna inside the tent you find: 5 blankets, 2 glow rods, 1 weeks rations each (salted lizard meat), 1 weeks water each, 1 week of feed for the dewback, and some scrap metal from the speeder.
Many of the Jawa begin and continue to sell their wares. Some even walk the floor trying to set a deal or two. One such Jawa points to your dewback and then to his scrap filled cart "Bargain, ysas ysas!"
As you step off the cart small rodent like creature scurry about your feet. Nearby a Jawa sells a strange cooked meat on a string which resembles the local rodents. Throughout the Jawa market you see that sales are not limited to the tables. Merchants shout their wares from every available corner.
Beside you a local moisture vaporator farmer loads his speeder. Giving your group a polite nod the farmer states "By the dune you have to respect the Jawa. They have little care who pays them or where the credits came from."
The assortment of salvage on display is bewildering to behold. Unlike many typical shops even those on Tattoine these Jawa merchants have no concern with what they sell or the order in which their wares are displayed. Droids, scrap metal, various parts, trinkets, food and more are piled together.

***The calm before the sandstorm happens when it's not even over… or begun.***
Guiding the cart helped distract her but Naryen is reminded of her failing, again, as she sees how unreserved Tar'ja is around Chase that she started to feel less defensive around him as well. The thought crosses her mind **I need to talk with her at some point.** as she recalls what he did at the Melt Down, just as their eyes nearly meet. Catching herself actually looking at him she turns away in disgust, at both him and herself, as she has the feeling that she actually misses the structure of the Imperial Navy over this relying on random strangers in the night of uncertainty.
Chases and he exposing himself, and therefore the rest of them, to now escalated threat angered her deeply. ***He should have know better than to reveal himself like that.*** She then recalls her own failing of not having better secured her officers sidearm as she escaped Varbrindaal. She should have known better.
**I'll go with you, Kasga, and see if there is anything useful here that we could arrange barter for. Thank you for working on the cart Dexter.** She turns to Tar'ja with a nod she hopes is of understanding between them. **We will remain in sight and won't be gone for long.**

Chase was happy to see what Dosenna had packed for them. Water and food, thought the food wasn't the best it would keep their strength up. The rations along with what was packed for the beast would keep them going for a week at least. maybe a few days more if they rationed well. He turned to the others to say what had been packed for them but stopped quickly. He saw a slight movement of Deidra's head turning away and the strong feeling eminate from the small woman. He wasn't able to place it exactly but it was one he had felt from her before. Simular to the one in the cafe after the Gran had died in the fight.
He took a breath and related the rations to the others. The whole time he did so he went over the battle in the cafe. Did he do the wrong thing? Was using his lightsaber a poor judgement call on his behalf? He considered these four here with him his friends despite the short time they have been together. They wouldn't understand or even believe it but Destiny brought them here together. He wasn't even sure he did but then again he has seen and experienced some strange things since meeting Master Garet almost three years ago. Through strength of will he squashed the feelings of uncertainty and sent them away. ***My friends were in danger with the odds practically 2 to 1 with Dexter frozen from the unexpected combat. I did what I had to do the best way I knew how to. Would I do it again? Yes. If not anyone of them could have been hurt or killed.*** He sighed inwardly. ***Master Garet I wish you were here. I still need some guidance from you.***
He was broken out of his thoughts by Deidra's voice. "I'll go with you, Kasga, and see if there is anything useful here that we could arrange barter for. Thank you for working on the cart Dexter." Chase watched her give Tar'ja a nod and continued. "We will remain in sight and won't be gone for long." She didn't even look at him as she left. He could still feel the same emotions coming from the former Imperial.
**"We'll keep an eye out also."** Chese replied matter of factly.
When Deidra and Kasga had left Chase reached for the beasts feed. **"I'll go out and feed the beast and look it over. If she dies we wont be far behind it.**  He looked at Tar'ja and gave ger a smile and a wink. **"I'll be back in here in quickly."** He looked at Dex. **"Dex when you finish if you want to go and meet up with the others to barter for things go ahead. We're not going anywhere."** With that Chase took the feed and went to tend to the beast and cart.

### **zerah** (2009-09-03 20:33:21)

Tar'ja shrugged a shoulder to the mentions of food "I have a few rations still stored in my belt, they aren't much but they keep hunger at bay." Idly she watches Chase rummage through the things given to them, glancing over his shoulder casually to take inventory mentally, granted though it also allowed her an excuse to be nearer to him.
"I'll go with you, Kasga, and see if there is anything useful here that we could arrange barter for. Thank you for working on the cart Dexter." The woman's voice caught her attention as she turns in time to see a nod her way, her lekku twitching faintly in response "We will remain in sight and won't be gone for long."
Tar'ja nods her head as the woman leaves, followed shortly by Chase to feed the beast; a faint whisper of the smile that was for him crosses her lips as she pulls his cloak over her features once more, holding the ends tightly as she moves to the front of the cart to watch him.

Kasga takes Chase's stun baton. He insures his Travotti service pistol is set on stun and the safety is set. Then he climbs out of the wagon releasing a shower of sand.
Grimly Kasga speaks aside to Deirdra, **"I doubt we'll find anything useful here. But we should check anyway."**, before walking toward the traders.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **master_Tru** (2009-09-09 12:16:49)

Chase begins to feed the dewback a mixture of meaty leftovers in broth. The beasts hide has turned tan with sand caked over its body. Taking a moment to brush off the thick layer of sand the animals spirits begin to pick up.
Kasga and deidra head into the swarmed market place, while Dexter repairs the tent and Tar`ja keeps a watch over everyone mostly Chase. Dexters hasty repairs are more then enough to stand up to normal desert conditions, but its the best the Bothan can do with the supplies at hand. Jumping down off the cart Dexter follows after his friends in the market, another set of eyes will help rummage through the Jawa yard sale.
Most of the merchandise is old and worn from use, with much of it only scrap. The tables look more like an archaeological spread then a yard sale. With items of every known, unknown origin and age its more like a historical find of Tatooines past and present. For an out of the way back water world Tatooine has had more then its share of visitors, judging from the assortment of merchandise.
Many merchants sell food and water though they seem unwilling to part with the water, not for anything your group has to offer. Much of the food is local rodents though the odd ration bar can be found. Some of the food is cooked most is live, at least you know its fresh.
As your group scavenges through the tables Kasga notices within a pile of scarp a carbon beating metal panel. It sticks out to Kasga for two reasons, one its obviously part of a star ship (well obvious to the pilot) and two it has the words "Horizon Bound" written in red across it.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2009-09-09 13:23:51)

Kasga wanders through the chaos of the marketplace. Realizing quickly the dealers would be cautious providing supplies, Kasga stops asking about them. *They'll cost way more than we can afford.* 
After that, he looks for other supplies. *That rifle scope would be useful. Uggghh, too high. There are a couple of energy packs. Whew, those are old. I wonder if they charge at all. There's a recharge unit. That looks servicable. If only I had more creds. Hey, what's that?*
Kasga gestures to Dexter, **"Hey Dexter, look at this!"**, pointing out the metal panel.
**"That's hull grade material. You're better with the scrap dealers. Can you find out where he got this?"**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-09-09 20:45:17)

With what was provides by Dosenna Chase set about taking care of the dewback. At the smell of food the beast seemed to respond well as it rose back to all four legs. The smell of the "stew" was atrocious to his senses but when set in front of the dewback it attacked the meal as if it hadn't been fed in a long while. Chase nodded ***Must be due to the exertion that it had to face from the sand storm.*** He gave the creature a lot of credit.
Looking over the beast it's normally green body was caked with sand. the high winds of the storm had caked on and wedged sand into its hide Taking several moments he brushed and slapped off as much of the irritating sand as he could. He looked back to where all the trading was going on. Kasga, Deidra were looking over things. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. At least for the moment. He looked back to the cart and saw Tar'ja looking out at him. He gave her that smile that he had only been using for her since he had met the beautiful Twi'lek. He wasn't sure exactly what to say so he talked about the animal. **"It's doing better after some food and grooming."** He made a gesture to the dewback. **"I have to say I never thought I'd be taking care of an animal like this."**
Just as he was about finished Dexter emerged from the tent. Looking up at where the damage was Chase saw that the Bothan had repaired the damaged section rather well. At least the best he could have under the conditions and materials at hand. ***He's good with his hands that's for sure. Now if we can just work on his combat ability a bit he's be a all around asset to the group.*** Chase thought to himself.
**"Nice work on the tear. Looks like it should hold up to normal conditions."**  Chase said as the spy walked pass.
Finishing up his animal tending he looked back to where Dex was meeting up with Kasga and Deidra. Seeing the three of them link up Chase was satisfied that they were relatively safe for now. ***Well as safe as one can be in the middle of a desert during a raging sand storm.*** Making his way back to the head of the animal he retrieved the bucket that he used to feed the dewback. Upon inspection it had been pretty much licked clean. With a nod of satisfaction he carried it back to the cart and stowed it away as securely as it had been during the storm. Then with a push up from his arms he leaped easily back onto the top of the cart and made his way to the tent. Checking one more time the others looked to be still rummaging through what ever they were looking at.
Reaching for the tent opening he entered brushing sand out of his hair. **"I'm not sure what they are looking at but it doesn't look like much."** He paused for just a second. **"And the sooner we're off this planet where I can enjoy a hot shower can't happen soon enough. This sand gets everywhere"** He said to Tar'ja as he took a few steps and sat down next to where she was looking after the others. Taking up the same position as she did facing the front of the cart. He sat close to her like before his leg touching hers. Despite the cloak that covered her Chase had no problem noticing the curvature of her body. **"You see anything worth noting?"**

### **zerah** (2009-09-10 02:39:29)

Tar'ja felt odd as the sudden urge to sigh and rest her head on her hand came over her. She was starting to think she may have fallen harder then she anticipated for the human, not that it seemed to really bother her too much, it wasn't interfering with the mission, or their duties so...what was the harm? Maybe her 'father' had been wrong about relationships, they weren't just for getting a job done, after all he kept 'mother' around and she didn't seem to do much of anything really...
She shakes her thoughts and smiles back at the human, glancing over as the other leaves to go after the other two, well that left the dewback, the jedi, and herself...now that was something she was looking forward to. "It's doing better after some food and grooming. I have to say I never thought I'd be taking care of an animal like this." He says to her and she chuckles nodding her head "Aye, seems to be a fairly tough beast, I must say I have a respect for it to be able to withstand this storm."
She watches him move around the carriage and then inside and over to her, his leg brushing hers "I'm not sure what they are looking at but it doesn't look like much. And the sooner we're off this planet where I can enjoy a hot shower can't happen soon enough. This sand gets everywhere" She chuckles but nods her head "mmm a nice hot shower does sound good..." "You see anything worth noting?" he asks, her leg moving faintly to brush against his while scooting closer slightly and looking out though not really paying attention "not yet...wonder what they'll find."

Dexter looks over his job on the tent that covered the cart they were using as away to get to the crash site. He was pretty proud of his work considering it was first time he had done anything like it. He followed the rest through the market area of sorts, junk dealer mostly you could find stuff of all sorts here. Some of it might be useful to if he had the time to spend working on it. He digs through some of the bends looking to see if there was anything of interest that might help them on there trip. "You guys find anything interesting? Don't know what we have to trade with but if we find something interesting might not hurt to pick it up." He continues to dig to see what there is.
As Dexter is looking around he hears one of his friends ask him to check something out. He moves over to Kasga to see what he wants. He looks at the dealer. "How much for this piece here my good sir? My friend and I are interested." Dex smiles at the dealer hopeing that this one piece was not going to all they could come away with.

Chase smiled as she echoed the thought of a hot shower. He pushed the thought from his mind or the thought of the hot shower was going to turn into a cold one. It didn't help that he leg was faintly brushing his as she moved closer. "Not yet...wonder what they'll find." she said almost absently.
He didn't know. But scavengers had a way of finding things. **"Who knows? Probably junk whatever it is."**
Chase liked being this close to Tar'ja. It was the way he felt being next to her that made him feel like he was 14 again standing next to the girl he liked back on Corellia. He brought his arm up behind her and let it rest on her back as he gently bumped her good arm and shoulder with his. **"How's the blaster wound? I have to say that I'm glad the Dosenna took care of it. I was worried that I might get slugged if I started to see to it."** He was smiling at her with a teasing look in his eyes. As he looked at her he couldn't help but notice again the lovely blue eyes that she had.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **zerah** (2009-09-10 13:00:37)

Tar'ja gave a faint, and unnoticeable she hoped, sigh at the arm that moved to her back. Muscles relaxing at just the faintest touch from him, it was really strange when she thought about it, who knew anyone could have so much power over her like that; to be able to relax her with a touch and convince her to stop a moment and tend to a wound.
She'd never met anyone like that before and if she was honest with herself she'd admit that the whole thing as terrifying. "How's the blaster wound?" his voice breaks her thoughts, then again it seemed it always did that, either breaking them or putting her into some thought process she didn't know she'd want to think on...strange. "I have to say that I'm glad the Dosenna took care of it." *I'm not, I was rather hoping you would tend it* "I was worried that I might get slugged if I started to see to it." She smirks and chuckles softly as she looks back at him "Slug you? Maybe one of the others but I don't think I'd slug you, if anything I think you'd have been the better person."
She flushes pink, thankful for once, her coloring actually hid most of it; she hadn't meant for him to know that. "Not...that I'm not thankful and great full for Dosenna taking care of it...it probably needed more care then I thought it would." She smiles that smile to him "Thank you...for convincing me it needed to be done."

**Shopping at a flea market&#8230; looking to see if they are actually selling fleas&#8230; ick**
The wind still howled, hungry with teeth of sand, but it seemed farther away, not breathing down their collective neck like it was doing. It seemed weaker where they are, though she thought that that may not be entirely a good thing, as she found some comfort from the cover it provided.
Naryen walked with Kasga to and around the tables with the occasional glance to the cart, showing Dexters efforts there, then to Chase watching him feed the... dewback? then later moving to Tar'ja.
She looked around her, trying to look every bit the engaged shopper she thought the ... Jawas? were looking for. She felt distracted by the events of late and seeing the closeness that Tar'ja and Chase were sharing was now bothering her a great deal more than she'd like. Her experience is that distractions can be fatal when timing is not in your favour. The forms for Imperial Tactical Loss Reports were not short.
She found her gaze, then, lingering on their forms, their motions suggesting their further indulging their apparant attraction. A quote from one of her xenobiology instructors flickered in her mind, something about life just wanting to "get busy" and procreation was simply a side-benifit, but she paid more attention to the coursework than the winks he sent her way. Some small part of her regretted not responding differently then and seeing those two surrendering more and more to their impulses increased Naryens feeling of regret, loss and ... envy?
Her expression changed as something new stepped into focus in her mind. ***Am I jealous of them both or one of them or is it simply that I wish I could live my life with such abandon?*** She started for a moment, with wider eyes as her mind raced through accessing that disturbing thought. She considered her emerging feelings of kinship for Tar'ja and the almost violent reaction, in her mind, to Chases carelessness.
***Next to Laehla, Tar'ja could be the last thing I have to family in this life.*** Her face tightened around her eyes at this thought of primal familial preservation. She started thinking of all the training she was exposed to for tactics on containing a Jedi.
She flinched away with a grimace splitting her expression, which had her facing Dexter as he drew attention to a piece of metal. At first she could see what was imprinted on it but a few blinks cleared her teary eyes somewhat.
***Horrizon Bound?***
Her eyes widened, this time for a very different reason. Through some applied control she pointed to that piece and raised her voice more than the storm sounds would have required. Her voice echoing from the walls around her told her she succeeded in projecting. **We are very interested in that piece and anything that was collected with it originally. Component parts would be of interest to us in particular.**
She dropped her voice for Dexter in particular and hoped that he understood she meant more than just noticing the piece of scrap. **Well done.**
She looked back to the scrap and wondered at the combination of fate traces could have them seeing slag from a ship they may come to rely on in the future. ***The Force with us?*** She looked up at the attendant of the pile with a hopeful expression.

Chase felt Tar'ja relax at his touch. The muscles in her back that had been tense seemed to turn to jelly.
His attempt at teasing her brought forth a chuckle in which made chase smile even bigger. It was nice to hear her laugh. It was something that she should do more often. "Slug you? Maybe one of the others but I don't think I'd slug you, if anything I think you'd have been the better person." She had said in response to him. She seemed stopped quickly it was then when he noticed the slight reddening of her a lilac coloring which he thought was pretty. "Not...that I'm not thankful and great full for Dosenna taking care of it...it probably needed more care then I thought it would."
Chase nodded as she spoke realizing that coming forth with that probably wasn't easy for her to admit. Upon reflex he slowly let his hand fall as he began to rub her back letting her know that it was ok. she gave him that smile that he liked so much. "Thank you...for convincing me it needed to be done."
He smile back at her. He seemed to have turned more towards her, coming closer, not even realizing it. His other hand taking the hand of the wounded arm. **"I'm glad I could do that and be there for you Tar'ja."** He took a steadying breath and squeezed her hand slightly. **"I'm not sure what's happening between us, but the way I feel right now I would not want to be anywhere else or with anyone else in the galaxy."**

"I'm glad I could do that and be there for you Tar'ja." she knew he was speaking, though the words weren't entirely going through to her brain, to preoccupied with how much closer he was getting and the warmth from his hand on her back. She was in trouble and she knew it and yet she couldn't bring herself to care. For the moment atleast they weren't in danger, they were on a break, for the most part they were hidden, what was the harm in letting her guard down just a little?
"I'm not sure what's happening between us, but the way I feel right now I would not want to be anywhere else or with anyone else in the galaxy." She gulped, oh how she felt the same "I..know how you feel.." gah that horrible! she couldn't even think well, but again..what was the harm?
**'You should never let your guard down, ever. If I even find out for a second you've let your guard down, you'll pay for it.'** *'What about sleep?'* **'Especially in sleep!'**  *'That's not fair! What am I to do? not sleep??'*
She flinches physically snapping her head away and gasping as though she had been hit, the proximity of the human and her guard letting down had brought a memory she had hoped had died all those years ago. She gulps and looks away with a faint frown.

Chase could feel the warmth coming from Tar'ja. Even though they were on a desert planet and she was wearing a cloak he had hoped the heat wasn't all from the weather conditions. Then she spoke 5 words and he knew that she was feeling the same as he was. "I..know how you feel.."
The smile stayed on his face as he looked deep into her blue eyes. All he wanted to do was close the gap of a few inches and kiss the lilac skinned beauty in front of him. Except the unexpected flinching of her head to the side stopped him. To Chase it looked as if she had been physically slapped. The emotions he had felt coming from her had changed. No longer were they like his. Now they were laced with anger and possibly fright. ***Did I do something wrong?*** He thought as he pulled away a little to look at her.
**"Tar'ja."** He said gently as he cocked his head a little while raising his hand from hers and gently touching her chin turning her face towards him. Concern was written across his face as he saw the frown that marred her other wise perfect face. **"Whats wrong? Did I offend or presume too much in that I thought you felt the same as I do?"**

Tar'ja shakes her thoughts and her head at the human "no no...no..it.." she sighs and shakes her head again "Memories...thought those were long gone.." She frowns again, taking his hand from her cheek though briefly allows herself to nuzzle the palm faintly.
"Father...something he had said...this..had just reminded me.." There was no love in the term of father, it sounded as though it was only a name to her and nothing else. "Don't let your guard down...not even in sleep..." she said faintly, "it was training. Never let your guard down ever, or he'd..." she sighs and shakes her head "wasn't just him."

When asked the Jawa merchant nods his head acknowledging he would like to trade. "Ikee bom`loo gomjam. Buse Tom`eepa ibana, upezzo upezzo!"
beside you two Jawa argue over pricing, and several other Jawa seem to be cheering a good day of trading. "Utinni utinni!" It was not obvious at first but you begin to realize that this swap meet is made up of several different Jawa clans.
Looking over this merchants table you do not see anything else that matches the panel. The jawa allows your group to examine the panel but watches you intently. It is not clear what part of the ship the panel came from.

Chase listened as she explained about memories. Memories from long ago. For a quick moment she held his palm against her face. Gently he rubbed his thumb across her cheek as she nuzzled it briefly before removing it. Their hands fell to her lap as she continued speaking. It was then that he realized that she had had a much different childhood than he had, much different. ***That would explain the way she acts. The reluctance to show that she may need help.*** Chase nodded the situation back at the farm with her blaster wound made more sense now.
"Father...something he had said...this..had just reminded me.." The lack of emotion with the word father struck a cord within him. Not having a family was one thing but having a family that had no love for a child was one that rose to a terrible new level. "Don't let your guard down...not even in sleep..." She said softly. "It was training. Never let your guard down ever, or he'd..." The sigh was unmistakable. "Wasn't just him."
Chase didn't know what to say. Memories especially strong one like these were hard to let go which he knew. The memory of Master Garet would always be with him. The image still made him angry though not like before. Now he could see Garet's sacrifice for what it was. It gave him a chance to escape.
**"I didn't know. I'm sorry."** He said softly to her. **"I'll tell you something that you already know. They aren't here. It's just us. You are with friends now. With people who care about you."** He took a short breath. **"I care about you Tar'ja. It's alright to let your guard down a bit. You don't have to let it all the way down but you can relax."** He gave her hand a gentle squeeze again. It was the only way he knew how at the moment to comfort her with out being overbearing. **"I would never treat you like they did."** He said with genuine affection as he looked at her.

Tar'ja offers a faint smirk to another thought i her head, her eyes taking on a stone look as she remembers something after her words to the human, she would need to tell him that part...but later, with the others, it'd be best they knew she supposed. "I didn't know. I'm sorry." she shakes her head with a humorless laugh "no one knows, you're the only one I've ever..." she frowns then "ever told..."
"I'll tell you something that you already know. They aren't here. It's just us. You are with friends now. With people who care about you." He took a breath there, but she knew the truth, they were always there, even now she could hear them like they were right beside her waiting for her guard to drop again..
"I care about you Tar'ja." *what?…* She looked genuinely surprised at this, at him, she knew that she had begun to develop something for him but...he cared about her, and he didn't say it like the family had...he meant that.. "It's alright to let your guard down a bit. You don't have to let it all the way down but you can relax." She continues to just stare at him, unsure of what to say.. "I would never treat you like they did." Her lips were parted slightly in shock as she looks to his eyes "do...you mean that?"

As he spoke Chase saw her just stare at him. It was as if she didn't know what to say. **"I would never treat you like they did."** His last words drew a soft response as her lips parted slightly. "Do...you mean that?" She asked as she looked into his eyes.
Chase gave her a soft smile and nodded. **"Yes Tar'ja I do mean that. I don't know what they did to you. From the look in your eyes and the anger and fear I felt from you when you mentioned your family, I can see why it's hard for you to let your guard down. You don't want to be hurt again."** He said the last as if he knew it was a fact. **"I wouldn't hurt you Tar'ja. I wouldn't take advantage. I would not treat you like they did."** He reached out for her other hand and held both them gently. His eyes never left hers as he spoke as the blueness of them drew him in again.

Tar'ja wasn't sure what to say, it had been years since then, since the incident and the last time she saw them she hadn't trusted anyone more then she absolutely had to...and she made sure that wasn't a lot. Now though, now...somehow these people had gotten under her skin and before she realized it she had somehow trusted them, well, two at least the other two were still something to watch.
You don't want to be hurt again. That's what he said, said it like fact, did she? She didn't let anyone get that close anymore so she'd never had to think about it before. She didn't want something like that again though, she remembered when she was little and still learning out to be the spy they wanted, they had sent her to practice on an officials family, listening and learning information; she'd spent longer then necessary there, just watching the way that family had treated each other, acted around each other. It was so different...they had loved each other, respected each other; she stayed just to pretend she was part of that, wondering how it felt. It was worth every hit she got just to have those memories in her head that she could revisit at night.
Don't want to be hurt again....yes...she supposed that was true...it didn't mean though that she was ready to trust people and take up a family with this group no, but...Chase..yes...maybe even the woman...if she ever stopped looking so hostile towards the Jedi. "I wouldn't hurt you Tar'ja. I wouldn't take advantage. I would not treat you like they did." Could she really trust him to keep those words?
She turns her pale eyes to his searching for the deception there but found none, yes...she could trust him. Idly she brushes her fingers along the skin of his palms "I..will hold you to it." She offers that smile, that one for him, locking her gaze with his "there's..more to the story.." she says softly "but I'd rather tell it...with the others there, I think it to be something they should know too.."

Chase saw the emotions and the thoughts race across her eyes. He tried to not be perceptive in the force to pick up on what she was feeling. It was hard though to shut down draw inward upon himself but he was somewhat successful in the attempt. She locked eyes with him again and he felt her fingers brush softly against the palms of his hands. He closed his eyes for a second at the touch and her words brought them back open. "I..will hold you to it." She said with that smile he liked so much. "there's..more to the story..bbut I'd rather tell it...with the others there, I think it to be something they should know too.." She spoke softly to him.
Chase nodded in understanding. **"I would expect nothing less from you Tar'ja. Stories about family and friends have a habit of being complicated. It's even more difficult when they are hard to talk about."** He shifted his weight as he sat in front of her, his gaze fell remembering his own past. **"We all have stories that can be hard to tell to others regardless what they are. It's not easy showing a possible weakness to others, even friends. Or even to those that may become…"** He paused for a second and looked at her. **"more than friends."** Her fingers still brushed softly against the palms of his hands.

Tar'ja watches him as he talks of the stories of people and nods her head "you seem to have a few to tell as well.." she was able to say before his next words hit her ears Or even to those that may become...more than friends." A blush moves over her cheeks at that, her eyes lowering to his hands then back up to him from beneath her lashes "and..how would one know if someone wished for them to be...more than friends..."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-09-13 15:52:24)

Tar'ja blushed again at his words. The redness added to her already pretty lilac color. He watched her eyes fall as he hung himself out on a limb. Only to see them raise again this time looking upon him from beneath her lashes. ***Chase you never stood a chance.*** He thought as he looked at her. Even covered up with his thick cloak she was still the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
"And..how would one know if someone wished for them to be...more than friends..." Her look and words made him smile. Since the conversation at the table in the *Meltdown Cafe* he had been drawn to her. At first it was her looks that caught his attention he couldn't lie about that. Now he was drawn in by more than what she looked like on the outside.
**"I seem to recall you starting something in the alley outside the cafe."** He leaned in closer to her as he spoke. He stopped when he was just an inches from her face. Her blue eyes stood out like the Tatooine sky from being so close to them. His hands held hers softly. **"I also remember promising to finish what you started."** His voice held a slight tone of teasing in it.
Despite how calm he looked to be, his heart was skipping beats. Being so close to her he would have sworn she could have heard it.

Looking the panel over, Kasga is convinced this is from the ship they are looking for. Turning to the Jawa merchant , he says slowly, **"This is good hull plating, but I notice you do not have more. Was there more where you found this? We're looking to upgrade some of our ship's armor."**

Tar'ja's heart was going wild, she thought she'd pass out if not be caught with how her heart beat. He was so close to her now and she was leaning all the more closer to him, smiling that smile to him, remaining calm as best she could. "I seem to recall you starting something in the alley outside the cafe." oh she remembered quite well about that, and now they were alone and no one was shooting at them, "I also remember promising to finish what you started." She grins and leans forward more, eyes slipping shut as her lips lean in to brush against his slowly "so I did..." she whispers against his lips.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-09-13 19:26:28)

He saw her grin as she came closer. At that moment he swore her heart rate doubled. Her eyes slowly closed as her lips gently brushed against his. At their touch he took in a breath. "So I did..." He heard her whisper, the words were even warmer than the hot desert air.
His lips met hers. This time though, their lips did not part as he shared the moment with her. The heat in the tent seemed to rise as his kiss became more passionate and his arms found the opening in the cloak as he moved to embrace her. Time seemed to stand still as he kissed. A few moments later he gently and softly broke the kiss. As he looked into her eyes a smile crossed his lips.
**"I think that hot shower is going to turn into a cold one."** He chuckled, halfheartedly joking with her as he rubbed her back with one of his hands.

The Jawa looks up to Kasga and nods "Bom`loo bom`loo. Ikee bom`loo gomjam. Buse tom eepa ibana upezzo upezzo!" as he points to the stun baton. The Jawa speaks no more but stands with his hand out palm facing up. The little Jawa seems to want to trade and is obviously excited about it.
Around you the crowds of Jawa push their way through in a constant struggle to find the best deal. Pushing their way past your group another clan of Jawa enter the market and spread out. The chatter of trade negotiations, animals and droids limit your hearing to the immediate area not that it matters no one in your group speaks Jawanese.
Back at the cart Tar`ja and Chase continue their conversation while the dewback slumps into a well deserved rest. The storm continues outside but has begun to lessen. The roar of the sand blasting winds start to wind down to a low rumble in the back ground. Soon it will be safe enough to travel the open sands again to continue the search bot for your team and the empire.

Tar'ja sighed against his lips when they met hers, her heart beats skipping as her hands slide up his arms. One rests still on his arm while the other moves to gently cradle his cheek; a shiver running over her form as his arms encircle her. It felt too soon before his lips parted from hers "I think that hot shower is going to turn into a cold one." She laughs, genuinly laughs softly and nods her head "I think you might be right...nice..cold shower.." She looks up to him from beneath her lashes again, this...this was nice...

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-09-15 00:57:23)

Her unexpected laughter brings forth his own laugh as she agreed with his assessment on the cold shower. She looked up at him again from beneath her lashes. The smile on her face told him that she was happy as was he. If he would have asked himself a month ago that he'd be in the arms of a beautiful Twi'lek on a backwater desert planet he would have simply laughed and then silently wished it was true. Just to make sure he gave her a gentle kiss and held her in his arms.
**"I could do this for the rest of the day…"** He said quietly into her ear as one hand softly rubbed her back again. This time he felt one of her lekku that was covered up by the cloak that was now somewhat disheveled. As one of his fingers drew a line down it he felt the softness of her skin and the straps of intertwining leather that wrapped it. **"but they will be back soon."** He took a deep breath and held her close not really wanting this short but special time to end knowing all to well that it would when the others returned.

Watching what the Jawa and Kasga. Dexter looks to where the trader was pointing. "I think he wants your stun baton in trade for the ship haul." Dexter looks around in the Jawa's bins some more looking for the pocket scamblers that help them out on this mission.

### **zerah** (2009-09-15 23:03:43)

Tar'ja's lekku twitch along his hand as he reaches them, "I could do this for the rest of the day..." he whispers into her ear, a faint shiver running down her spine at the breath and touch to the leather bands around them; she'd never actually had someone touch them before. "but they will be back soon."
Oh she knew he was right, but at the moment she was finding it hard to come up with reasons to care. Her fingertips trail along his arm, she was sitting awkwardly and more instinct had her leg moving to wrap lightly around his ankle, her face close to his allowed her to faintly train her nose along his skin; just savoring the closeness of the moment and hoped it wouldn't be cut short too soon.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-09-15 23:36:18)

The touch of her fingers as they traced a trail up and down his arm causes him to wiggle it a bit. **"Hey that tickles a bit."** He said softly still holding her in his arms. She shifted a bit and they ended up a little closer. He picked up his head slightly and gently kissed her on the neck where it joined with the shoulder. Another calming breath took place as he pulled back to look her in the eyes. Her eyes held him there. They were one of the things that he like the most about her. So much could be read by just looking into their pale blue depths.
He smiled, a more serious look came across his face as he brought up his left hand and ran the back of his fingers down her cheek. **"Not to ruin this special time but we have a mission to do."** He turned his head to look out the flap that Tar'ja had been using to watch him and the others. With his right hand he moved it to the side a little. **"It looks like it's clearing up a bit. Well be heading out soon."** He let the flap fall back as he brought his gaze back to her.

**Shopping at a flea market&#8230; Yep, they&#39;re actually selling fleas.**
Naryen recalls what she read about Jawas at Dossanas farm & smiles as the Jawa asks for money for information about where it was found but not for component parts that were found with it. What she's notices in the market was devoid of useful gear or equipment. **"Perhaps you're right Dexter."**
***The Jawa seems to think it's just the plating we are interested in.*** She opened her mouth to speak when another thought occured to her and she looked to the plating in alarm. ***What if the ship we are procuring is not the Horrizon bound.***
She looked at the part now with a sense of alarm at the rather disturbing stream of consiousness that thought inspired. She held looked at the Jawa with a hessitant smile **"May I examine this plate?"** The Jawa nods and Naryen reaches to & picks up the plate to examine it for interfaces or ID numbers with her gloved hand.
As she looks it over, taking in any available detail, Naryen feels the air change subtly, the sound changing in tone. The hairs on the back of her neck claw at her collar as she looks from the plate to the sky. Getting a feel for the change in the air she looks towards Mos Eisley. To her horror the only tactical advantage they had seems to have diminished signicantly.
Naryen pitches her voice for her companions **"We need to leave very soon or we will be fully exposed to high altitude Imperial aerial support."**
She turns back to the Jawa with a smile and repeats her question. **"I'm sorry, I think you misunderstood, I'm interested in any component parts that were found with this piece please."** She points to the name. **"If this is a valid ship piece then then parts for the ship are of interest to me."**
(((OOC: If she sees anything useful on it it's noted and brought to Kasgas and Dexters attention. If it's simply a plate, then she returns it to the stack and turns to the cart. Coming across this chuck of hull platting will likely be a signpost in her mind for some time. If there is something to bargain with .)))

Kasga's inquiry yeilded a decent response. Since he didn't understand the language, it was hard to be sure what he was negociating for. The Jawa seemed interested in Chase's stun baton. At this rate, the requirements for this mission would beggar them.
Deirdra's commentary takes Kasga by complete surprise. He tries hard to keep his fury off his face. He clenches his fist to keep from backhanding her. *That does it. Once we get on our way again, her runoff mouth will be addressed.*
Trying to interject smoothly, Kasga responds, **"She's right, we're interested in where we can find more components like this. Dexter, can I see the map you acquired?"**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **ganthet** (2009-09-17 20:14:41)

"Ok." Dexter pulls out the data pad that has the map on it,and hands to Kasga. "Might be a bit of a communication problem. And don't trade it, we need it." Dexter goes back to rummaging around in the bins.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **master_Tru** (2009-09-18 09:29:49)

Finding no pocket scramblers Dexter hands Kasga the data pad. With one hand Kasga holds the stun baton out towards the Jawa merchant as an offering of payment, with the other he holds the data pad which currently shows an image of the search zone. After passing over the data pad Dexter resumes his search chances are he could find most anything here the problem is searching through the mass of wares on display, and you have only seen part of the yard sale so far.
The Jawa grabs at the stun baton greedily but finds that Kasga is holding it tightly. Motioning with the data pad Kasga indicates again the map. The Jawa takes the hint and points to the map "Ikee m`tuske juun dooka kee bok umka upeezo. Dooka okka unn wass tonton bepom kova. Hazamuzee! Hunya fou umpee m`tuske waff`mla" The little Jawa merchant puts his finger on the map the runs a line up. Taking the baton the Jawa moves to the next potential customer.
The spot indicated on the map is only a days walk from the Jawa caves though you are confused as to why the Jawa made a line with his finger. Deidra looks over the panel which looks like it took a beating, possibly from a fire fight or from entering the atmosphere in a hard dive.
Back at the cart Tar`ja and Chase finish their short embrace wishing for gentler times, wishing for slightly different circumstances. Looking out side into the market they spot Deidra Dexter and Kasga not far from where they had been before. The group has stopped at on of the traders tables and Deidra has a large object in her hands.

"Well I guess it could be worth checking out." Dexter looks up at Kasga. "What you think?" Dexter picks up the hull plating and gives up looking in this dealers bins. "I want to check out a few other dealers before we leave, we should take this back to the cart and let the others know what we found." Dexter smiles to himself *"Information is life." "That is what was drilled into every young Bothan in trianing and they where right."*  Dexter waits for Kasga to finish his business before taking his prize back to the cart. "I wonder if the others have found anything interesting?"

Kasga watches carefully, memorizing the route the Jawa indicated. *Once I get back to the cart, I'll note it more carefully on the map.* As the Jawa turns away, Kasga thanks him.
When Dexter mentions he wants to keep shopping, Kasga responds, **"I'd like to get back to the so I can make some more precise notes. I'll be happy to come along after that."**

Tar'ja didn't want to move from her position, she didn't him to release her, and right now she didn't want the other to return. What she wanted was a nice ship to themselves, traveling together even, peaceful times, no secrets and no missions. Alas...it was not so, she sighs at his words, she knew he was right; they would be coming back soon and they would have to separate...as much as possible at least.
"It looks like it's clearing up a bit. Well be heading out soon." She glances back through the little curtain and nods her head "so it is..." it was time for business again, though..."we should be heading back out soon before we loose the cover..." she smirks at him and leans close, nearly kissing him with how close her lips were to his "though I do hope we will continue this later..."

He nodded as she leaned in closer to close the gap he had created just seconds before. He smiled when she stopped. Her lips were so close to his. "Though I do hope we will continue this later..."
In response to her suggestion he pulled her closer, back into the embrace that had just shared with that half smile gracing his face**"Just try and stop me."** He emphasized his remark by closing the last two inches and showered her lips with soft gentile kisses as his hands rubbed her back. Her clothing did little to hide the lithe form that was underneath.
Taking a breath he pulled away. **"I have to stop or they are going to catch us red-handed. Not that I really give a dam at the moment but it might be best. I'm a lucky man Tar'ja."** Slowly he moved to stand up from their spot on the cart. He didn't want to but they were going to have to go to work soon. A thought ran across his mind again which was voiced rather quietly though it was loud enough for Tar'ja to hear. **"Definitely going to be a cold shower."** He said with a grin as he stood next to her.
**"I wonder what they're bringing back?"**

Kasgas sudden tension was easily noticed, after she had spoken, especially standing so close to him. Naryen stared at him a moment, blinked, then looked at the Jawa. ***Oh, we don't know the Jawas allegences or what could be being used to observe us. Of course. I'd gotten used to talking aloud.*** Naryen visibly withdrew, looking around rather self-consiously, standing with a much more conservative posture.
Watching the Jawa indicate a path into SBCs search grid, Naryen realized then what was traded for. ***Either avoiding obstacles or perhaps where a debrid field started. Best to start there then.*** Nodding thanks to the Jawa turned without further comment and walked back to the cart leaving the other two to their business.
The walk back to the cart was brief but thoughtful. They needed to leave soon or they would be completely exposed while they searched. If the Jawas had already scavenged the wreck how could there be anything else of value left?
So many questions.

Tar'ja's lekku were twitching again against her back at the kiss, she do this all day. But then...he moved, she knew it was for the best else the continue and never seperate, they needed to think on the mission, more of this could come after they had finished and were off the planet. She had to smile though at the lucky man comment, true though, what did he mean? just being next to her? after all he had made many comments on how beautiful he thought her...or was there more to it?
"Definitely going to be a cold shower." She chuckles softly, slipping back into 'business' mode at the thought of the others arriving at any moment. "I could help with that." she sends a wink to the Jedi and smirks as she hopped to watch the colors change on his cheeks, really making him blush was becoming a favorite pastime.
"I wonder what they're bringing back?" The comment had her looking over her shoulder to find the others were indeed heading back their way, probably then a good thing that Jedi had moved when he did. She looks each over and hums "Doesn't look like they have anything in their hands...maybe this was a loss cause for information?"

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-09-20 01:11:32)

As Chase stood and made his comment about the cold shower he wasn't expecting a response from Tar'ja. He heard her laugh softly which drew a look from him. when his eyes met hers he saw the laughter in her eyes as she winked and gave him a smirk. "I could help with that."
He just stood there and looked at her. He could feel the heat rise up in his cheeks and he knew that he was going through a severe case of blushing. She just sat there with the smirk on her face like she was enjoying getting this kind of response out of him. Jedi in training or not he was only human. He smiled back at her and nodded. **"I don't think…"** He let his voice trail off for a second. **"… I'd fight you on that one. Well not to hard at least."** He tried to say nonchalantly. Yet the look in his eyes was electric.
The conversation had gotten back to the mission at hand. He had hoped that found out something but he wasn't holding out for the lucky break. If they were to find something the Force would see to it.
"Doesn't look like they have anything in their hands...maybe this was a loss cause for information?" He heard Tar'ja say. He shrugged as he stood there standing next to her. The thought of the shower tucked into the back of his mind. A memory from Master Garet came to him this time. It was one that dealt with personal relationships.
***Be mindful of relationships. Especially one that deal in strong emotions. The emotions of relationships could lead to fear, jealousy, anger, hate. Feed upon those emotions and lead yourself down a dark path will you be.***
Chase sighed inwardly as he looked at Tar'ja. He had feelings for her. Strong feelings that were impossible to hide. Not only from himself but from the others as well, especially Tar'ja. This was tricky ground for him. He had learned from Master Garet that the Jedi of old had forgone relationships to better server the Force. That a relationship could interfere with a Jedi's responsibilities. Garet made sure to tell him that not all Jedi had seen it this way. Especially now after the purge this wasn't a black and white matter. ***Be mindful of the Living Force and it will help guide you.*** He remembered the his old Masters advice.
**"Shall we see what they found out?"** He smiled as he held out his hand, an offer to help her to her feet. ***The Force lead me to Kasga and then to the others at the farm. It lead me to her for a reason. In time that reason will be made known. At this moment I'm happy that it has lead me to you.*** He thought as he looked to where the others would be coming from. ***To all of you.***

Tar'ja smiles, his smile, at him and chuckles. Oh she did love to see that blush and the electricity in his eyes...that was an added perk but oh how addictive that could become.
*Relationships cloud the mind and make you screw up in battle and in a mission, and if you screw up, you screw all of us up and it will be your fault if any of us die because of it.* More words of wisdom from her 'father' when she had made the mistake of mentioning she had found a little bothan cute when she was eight. She had to avoid the boy, and told him that she couldn't play with him because her family would die. Needless to say he didn't understand but thought her too weird to be worth his time.
The thought sprout up again at this new juncture in her life, relationships could get you killed, but she'd never had the chance to have one so maybe they weren't so bad. Looking the human up and down she had to admit, she liked this one, really liked this human...maybe a relationship wouldn't be too bad.
"Shall we see what they found out?" she looks up at the now offered hand and takes it, holding it in a loose grip as she pulls herself to a standing position. She kisses his cheek gently "aye...lets go and see then." Her hand doesn't leave his though, continuing to hold it for as long as he'd let her.
She liked the warmth of his hand, the implications it brought that she saw of others, she didn't want him to let go of it, family be damned on what they said, she wanted what they had denied her, and now at least she could attempt to have what she missed most of her life. She liked him..

Frustrated Dexter continues his search table by table looking for a pocket scrambler. Minutes later Dexter finds a small pile of scramblers several tables away. Most are very dated but the Dexter manages to find one still in working order. Three Jawa watch over the table which holds mostly droids, droid parts and a few odd item like the scramblers. One of the merchant Jawa takes notice of Dexters interest in the scrambler "Mum m`aloo bom`loo bom`loo mambayz?"
Kasga makes his way back to the cart without incident and is meet by Tar`ja and a red faced Chase. Ignoring the weird human Kasga completes his task of mapping the line drawn by the Jawa merchant. Kasga takes the time to ensure accuracy the Duros does not stop until he is satisfied his work is done correctly.
The cave entrance where you have parked starts to get a little more crowded as another clan of Jawa arive. Outside a third sand crawler casts its shadow over the caves entrance. As the new Jawa enter they begin shouting:

Dexter looks over his find. *"It will have to do."* He thinks to himself. He pulls the energy cell from his utility belt and shows it to the Trader. *"Hopefully this will be enuff."* he thinks to himself again. He could have tried to trade for another one that he might have been able to repair, but there was not time for that now and this would help if needed. His attention is distracted for amount by the new comers to the market. Another tribe had shown up to do business maybe there might be more information to be had. *"I will have to keep my ear to the ground and see what I can come up with." Translator unit might not be a bad idea to try to come across either."* He smiles at the Jawa. Hopeful that this deal can be concluded easily and he can get to other things that need doing.

Tar'ja took his hand and stood with little help. As an added bonus she raised herdelf on to her toes a bit and softly kissed his cheek which did little in lessening the redness upon his cheeks. He gave her hand a squeeze and continued to hold it as she echoed his intent on finding out what the others had found. He smiled as he looked at her as the cloak was now somewhat disheveled remembering their embrace and the fleeting moments of tenderness they shared. **"We may want to fix that cloak up a bit. It seems to have come a bit…undone."** He said with a smirk as he let go of her hand so she could arrange it so that it covered her telltale lilac coloring.
He reached out again for her hand as he lead her to the tent opening. With his free hand he opened up the flap and let her walk through first following right after. Looking towards the trade show he saw Deidra and Kasga walking towards the cart. Chase noticed that Kasga was holding the datapad that held the mission information and that his stun baton was missing. **"What did you find. Anything useful?"** The Duros took no time and went to work on the data pad Ignoring the two of them there. Chase shrugged as he looked at Tar'ja when his question went unanswered. **"Must be they found something."**
Deidra was just seconds behind Kasga. He started to ask her how it went but thought better of it considering the situation. He gave Tar'ja's hand a gentle squeeze. The long sleeves, of the cloak that was fitted for him, covered the sweet gesture and their hands.

Kasga is intent on getting the map defined correctly. It wouldn't do to come all this way and die in the desert 'cause they got lost. He ignored Chase and Tar'ja and reasoned their discomfort came from waiting for him.
Finally he looks up from his transcription and speaks evasively. **"We got something. I don't know how useful it will be. "** He shuts down the datapad and slides it into a pocket of his ship suit. **"I think we'll be ready to go once Dexter gets back. Is the cart repaired and the beast ready to go on?"**

Tar'ja watches silently as Kasga moves past she and Chase without a word as she fixes the cloak so that it fell around her better, taking a step closer to Chase so that holding his hand was more so hidden. She glanced to his features as she noticed he had begun to speak but stopped himself, looking over to who it was she understood why.
"Have you found anything Deidra." she asked for him, giving his hand a squeeze in reassurance, she wouldn't let the woman yell at him for the rest of the trip, yelling could be done when they had time to argue.
"I think we'll be ready to go once Dexter gets back. Is the cart repaired and the beast ready to go on?" Her head turns to look at Kasga again and nods "yes, we're ready to go."

**OOC:** A lot going on here with characters talking. I hope I don't make it any more confusing.
**IC:**
Chase felt the squeeze on his hand as Tar'ja asked Deidra about what they found out. It was a good feeling having her there with him hand in hand. That feeling of closeness that two people could share was reassuring. That she would "watch his back", so to speak. It was similar to being along side Master Garet for those two years. Chase smiled at that as he looked at her barely able to see her beautiful face that was well hidden from the hood of his cloak. ***Similar but very different.*** He thought as he remembered to just a few moments ago as they held each other. ***Very different indeed.***
He was brought from his thoughts as Kasga spoke, surprised that the Duros finished so quickly. A quick yet uninformative reply to his earlier question was finally delivered by the pilot. "We got something. I don't know how useful it will be. " He said quickly. Chase looked at the pilot. While it was good that they got some information Chase wondered why more wasn't divulged. He reached out with the Force and was glad he wasn't able to sense any deception. Tar'ja answered his question on their sit rep. He nodded in agreement.
**"I don't believe it will stand up to much more than normal weather conditions. Which shouldn't be long from now I imagine."**  He looked at the pilot and continued. **"Any chance you'll elaborate on what you found or are you waiting till we're back out on the wastes?"** He asked his question carefully. He wanted to give Kasga the benefit of the doubt in hoping that when they were out and away from the impromptu Jawa trade center he would release what info they had acquired.

**The unforgiving dunes of Tatooine watching rivals fighting over a location?**
Plodding to the cart Naryen was reflecting on Kasgas flash of anger, when she looked up and noticed the body language conversation happening between Chase and Tar'ja. It occured to her, almost imediately, how disarmed Tar'ja now appeared. The flash of anger towards Chase and herself, for not having dealt with this before, was sharp and suprised her with its intensity. After her nerves being left raw from the unexpected friction with Kasga this seemed to affect her more than she was ready to deal with and stepped to speak with Chase.
Tar'jas voice was softer yet insistant when she spoke "Have you found anything Deidra?" that caused her a brief pause ***Is she running interference for him?*** She looked at her a moment. As she reflected on the Twi'Lek her expression softened. ***Of course, she is rather capable. Still…***
It was then that her emotional momentum was stopped by the shouts of the new band of Jawas.
**"I'm sorry, Kasga can brief you, this may be of concern to us."** She nods an apology to Tar'ja, shoots Chase a warning glance, then sets off purposfully to the Jawas.
She thought the new tracked vehicle was simply business as usual until they started shouting. ***That doesn't seem consistant with a market environment.*** She scowls a little, walked briskly towards the newcomers, and takes out her pad, verifying that the tranciever/transponder unit is still disconnected and secured under her lock code. ***That almost sounds frantic.***
She experiences some measure of relief as she considers that she's probably not ready to deal with Chase right now. His whims, at the moment, seem to want Tar'ja alive so that should hold him for the moment. With a steadying breath, to center herself, she quickly sets up an secured interface partition on the pad then looks to the Jawas. ***I need to look into some translation applications!***
With genuine concern expressed from every feature she holds one hand at her side, beckoning for attention, and with the other holds out the pad in front of her while moving her fingers indicating mock use of it's interface.
Pitching her voice to carry over the still blowing wind: **"Greetings. Is there a problem I can assist with? Can you type it here I'm afraid I don't understand Jawa!"** She turns her shoulder a little to block a gust of wind and grit. ***Better than it's been by far.***

Diedra addresses the first Jaw new comer she meets. Holding the data pad out and speaking to the Jawa Deirda trys to get a translation. The little Jawa looks up to Deidra the responds "Bom`loo bom`loo!" The Jawa produces a small leather bag containing various dried rations, about four weeks worth. "Ysas bom`loo?" The Jawa pauses then reaches for the data pad as if to take it.
Beyond the network of caves the howl of the storm has died down somewhat and is now almost gone. The storm rages on off in the distance but has passed over this area for now.
The market chatter escalate as thee new Jawa enter into the trade frenzy. many Jawa take notice of your group some even approach to take a closer look at the Dewback or cart. The Jawa poke at the dewback while checking its quality. The dewback growls in protest but does little else due to years of domestic training.

### **Yogi** (2009-09-23 16:30:09)

Chase stood on the cart with Tar'ja and Kasga. It was evident that the pilot wasn't going to divulge any information on what they had come up with so he wasn't going to push it at the moment. If it was an issue after that had left that would be a different story.
Looking to where the new arrivals were he saw Deidra trying to converse with one. He saw the Jawa make some hand gestures and show something to the former Imperial. Sensing nothing wrong he looked past the entrance to the network of caves that was providing them the shelter from the storm. It was then that he noted the absence of the howling wind. A sure sign that the storm was passing.
**"Storm is just about passed us. As soon as they come back we should go."** He said to the two that stood with him.
As the newcomers came closer some of the Jawa's took an interest in the cart and the Dewback. One even took a poke at the beast as if looking it over. He smirked. **"I'll shoo them away. Make sure they know nothing is for sale."** With that said he gave Tar'ja hand a quick squeeze and lept down the few feet to the sandy ground. The impact raised a little dust as his feet sunk a inch or two from the landing. He moved towards the closest Jawa and imitated what he had seen back in Mos Eisley. He held out one hand and made a shooing motion. **"Not for sale, not for sale."** He said firmly as another one approached. It seemed to work as it kept most others from attempting the same thing as they saw the others shooed away.
He walked back to the cart. Looking almost directly up he could see Tar'ja face pretty well from this angle. He gave her a smile as he spoke. **"I'll say this, their pretty persistent little buggers."**

**Dried rodent corpses for an encrypted Imperial Portable. Such a suave salesman this rank cloaked munchin is!**
Naryen watches with dismay as the storm seems to leave them. ***Well, that makes things harder.***
When the Jawa seems to offer to trade her pad for some rations she pulls the pad back from the Jawa and moves her free hand, palm out, towards the Jawa. With a firm but friendly voice she then says to the Jawa **"I'm sorry I don't want to trade my pad."**
***I misjudged this. The new ones are anouncing their wares, it seems, not yelling warnings of Imperial patrols.***
Disappointed and pressed for time she straightens and returns her pad to her pack and secures it. **"I'm sorry for the confusion, please have a good day."** she turns and walks back to the cart. As she's turning she hears Kasgas aparant expletive.
"We need to get moving. What ever conflict these tribes have is not ours. Let's go get Dexter and move on." Naryen nodded opened her mouth to respond agreement then stoped, and stared at Kasga a moment. **"You left him alone?** She looked to Dexter at that and says mostly to herself **"So did I I suppose."** She turns back to Kasga, **"I'll get him, please get back to the cart and prep to leave."** Then whrils around and walks back to Dexter.
**"Do you need any help friend?"** She offers Dexter with no shortage of urgency in her voice.

Tar'ja's lekku twitched the moment the woman had decided to help some poor sad species that she felt needed help. Honestly if they needed help it probably wouldn't be from them, outsiders. She was going to go after the woman and drag her back if she had to but the little...things had taken to their cart and ride.
"I'll shoo them away. Make sure they know nothing is for sale." She sighs, thank the stars for that, she didn't know if she had the patience to not be rude. She watches the human move to shoo the others while Kasga seemed to notice the only other female was playing good deed maker and went after her.
Sighing the twi'lek just continues to sit there at the back of the cart, watching the jedi shoo the things away and in the distance the other two seemed to be returning. There was a pause with the woman and she seemed to wander off again...another sigh from her as she runs a hand along her face, what was with that woman. First she can't stand the jedi, then she feels a sudden urge to help others when they're already on a mission to help people, then...what? she has a sudden urge to shop?
"I'll say this, their pretty persistent little buggers." Pale blue eyes glance up to the Jedi a small smile gracing her lips at the sight of him "at least you got rid of them." She nods over to the woman "seems she's got a bit more shopping to do..." she watches the woman a bit more then blinks "ah...she went to get Dexter." The twi'lek sighs "Lets hurry and get the dewback ready so we can get going."

Chase leaned up against the repulsor cart, next to where Tar'ja was sitting, with his arms resting on it. Her blue eyes fell upon him as she graced him with another smile. ***I don't think I could ever get tired of seeing her smile. She should do it more often.*** He thought as he looked up at her. When she mentioned Dexter he looked behind him and saw that Deidra had gone to see the Bothan. He hoped that she would get him to come along and soon as it was time to go.
"Lets hurry and get the dewback ready so we can get going." He heard Tar'ja sigh as she echoed his thoughts.
**"Good idea. I'll get it turned around and ready to move. The sooner we're done here the quicker we're off this dust-ball of a planet."** He turned back around from looking at Dex and Deidra and nodded. He pushed away from the cart and walked to the front of the dewback. Grabbing the reigns he began to coax the beast into standing up and turning itself and the cart around. The whole time he talked gently to it trying to reassure it in what he was doing was the best thing.
As he worked the animal around he looked her way a few times and wondered what would happen to the five of them after this mission for the rebellion was over. Would they be split up? Allowed to stay together? Or a bit of both?
He looked at Tar'ja again and gave her that half smile he used for her. ***I hope they keep us together.*** He thought as he looked at the others. ***All of us together. I think we could work well together if the whole trust thing can be resolved. The Force brought us all here for a reason. Best not to scoff at it with out good reason.***
He did his best to have the cart and beast ready to go by the time the others returned. the sooner they were off the better. Lives depended on it.

Dexter looks at his friend as she walks up to him. "Not really just finishing up some business here." Dexter hands the energy cell to the Jawa trader. "Looking at the pocket scambler. "This should help us out. Maybe we can get lucky and will have an Imperial code on it." Dexter smiles as he walks back to the cart with his friend. "Did Kasga tell you want we found?" "Should be close to what we are looking for."

### **master_Tru** (2009-09-25 07:45:24)

The Jawa pauses for a moment the examines the energy cell closely. Shrugging the Jawa responds "Ysas, bom`loo." Accepting the trade Dexter turns to see Deidra approaching his poition.
Back at the cart chase waves his arms frantically at the Jawa, like rodents they scatter. Though in their very nature it can be assumed some of them will maintain a watchful eye over a potential profit from a distance if need be. Some of the surrounding Jawa nearby take notice but do not react. Many of their race are treated far worse by others.
With Dexter and Deidra back within the group its only a simple matter to rouse the deback. Outside the clouded sand storm can still be seen in the distance hovering its bulk over the city. The winds are still strong but visibility is almost back to normal. Overhead the twin suns blaze down on the desert floor.
With the winds reduced you are able to open the tent to allow for a second watch as you travel. Still using the tent for protection from the twin suns the temperature rises o almost unbearable levels. The sand and dunes seem to meld into one blur making it difficult to visually track your position and destination. Kasgas directions on the data pad allow you to continue onward. Reaching the top of yet another dune Tar`ja is the first to notice the break in a nearby dune. Where the dune would have resembled a sandy wave, now cut at the top in a semi circle. Dexter then points out a glint of light, when your group reaches the dune you find the area littered with small metal fragments. In the distance you can see a faint line through the dunes as if something drew a line almost matching Kasga`s directions.

**Tatooine Dehydrator &amp; Tanning bed combo unit TM! Guarunteed to keep your skin scaley and stiff! All the rage on the outer rim! Order in the next 20 cycles and delivery is free!**
As they walked back to the cart Naryen nodded to Dexter at the mention of a desire for Imperial Codes. ***I saw, map coords right? I hope they yield something useful.*** She made no attempt to sound hopeful.***Perhaps we could discuss codes en route?***
Once situated, and shielded from the sun, Naryen discussed with Dexter the finer points of Imperial comm security. ***I can provide you with some codes but they are likely all revoked at this point and could be easily back traced anyway so they'd be of limited value. I think, however, some work with the core of a code cylinder may yield better results from its fractal encryptor unit.*** Flashing a conspiritorial smile she focussed on Dexter to avoid interacting with Chase for the trip. A shame that the result was also limiting her contact with Tar'ja but she seemed to be providing him enough of a distraction. Naryen ended up feeling thankful for that.
As they travelled, though, it quickly became evident the heat was going to be a problem for her. She missed home so much. Crystal Falls. Ice surfing. Glacier climbing. The lower stress life of living, aparantly, without fully realized free with thanks to Imperial oversight.
The wind bit a little more at that.
When then came across the debris field, what the Jawa was indicated became clear to Naryen. It was a crash path. A more focussed search area and an identification.
***The Horrizon Bound.***
Naryen found herself fiercely alert as they started following the Jawa coordinates and scouring the vista in front of them.
***I suppose now we find out why that trader could only recover a hull fragment.***
She started to consider that this might end up being more than simply a courier run.

"Well I could try to make it work if only use it one way. To listen in and not transmit. Any info I could get about the Imps would be useful." Dexter hoped his friend would not take ofence to he slag he used. He had no love for the Empire, at the same time he did not want to hurt his friend. "Hey Kasga, you still have that datapad? I want to look over the map on it again." Outside he could still here the wind and sand hitting the side of the tent that covered the cart they rode in. Thinking to himself*"I hope my patch holds. We don't need anymore sand in here gumming up the works anymore then it has."* He pulls his cloak titer around his face and upper body to comfort himself and listens to what his friend has to say.

With out much fuss they were underway when Dexter and Deidra returned to the cart. Dex seemed to have picked up a gadget and Deidra resumed the cool almost hostile attitude towards him again.
He sighed as he stood next to Tar'ja when Deirda leveled her gaze at him. To be honest this bothered him. To be distrusted so much. Even though she was an Imperial he thought the brief talk/wrestling match in the cockpit between them might have resolved some of that.
As they left the protection of the caves and the large Jawa crawlers the wind picked up. While still strong it was nothing like before. Very little sand was picked up and blown around now which allowed them to open up the tent.
As the temperature rose it was starting to become unbearable. The twin suns simply beat down upon them. Chase shed jacket that he wore earlier to protect himself from the sand that was whipping around. He undid his shirt a bit and it wasn't long before the heat had caused him to soak it in sweat. Conversations were pretty quiet. It was as if the heat snuffed out the will to converse. Deidra and Dex talked a bit as he sat with Tar'ja. Several times he left the tent to look ahead to where they were heading.
It all seemed to happen at once. Tar'ja spotted a break in the dune. Dex was quick to follow up spotting the sun glinting off of something. Upon reaching the dune they all saw the debris, small metal fragments, littering the area. In the distance on their heading a faint line was drawn in the sand. One matching the directions Kasga had.
**"We're close now. All we have to do is find the wreckage and survivors, if any. Maybe I can help with that."** He stood there and closed his eyes focusing will to use the Force. He was getting stronger each day in its use not to mention easier. Master Garet would have been pleased with his progress.
The Force flowed within him as he reached out with his senses. With the Force he could "see" things others might not find. Sensing a living being was one of them. Out here in the barren wastes of the desert if there was anyone from the crash alive he should be able to sense them.
A bead of sweat rolled down his temple onto this cheek as he exerted his presence in the Force.

"Well unless someone has a scanner finding anything after the storm will be interesting to say the least." Dex looks out at the wreckage. "Well if there are any pieces big enuff to use as shelters, that might be a place to start." Dexter looks over the area of space parts. This was not going to be easy. "So what is our plan of attack on this?"

"Also keep your eyes peeled for other scavagers or Imperials."**

"Ok, sounds simple enuff." "We worried about men in white showing up or are they back at there base sippin caf?" Dexter fights back the image of that night. It still haunted him, but he had to get past it. "There of course is the Sandpeople and Jawas that might show up. Rather fight those two gamoreans I ran into awhile back." Dexter looks at the others and smiles. "Long story. When we are done and off planet I will tell you over a bottle." Dex looks down at the data pad with the map.

Scattered randomly throughout the area are small metal fragments. Much of it has been covered in the recent storm, another storm like that or a few weeks and all evidence would be lost forever. As you search the area the debre found gets larger as you continue down the trial, the same trail marked on the map by the Jawa.
The dewback itself seems to become agitated whipping its tail rapidly and tasting the air with its tongue. As you look closer you can see fragments of glass. At first you discount it as more debre but as you see more and more of it you realize its the sand melted into glass shards. Something very hot blasted this path. A meteor of possibly a ship on fire could have done this.

He stood there as he reached out with the Force. To the others it would seem like he was doing nothing when he was actually putting forth considerable effort when doing this. This aspect of using the force had always been a little harder for him. It has been easier but the effort is still required.
He heard the others talk as he bent his will and focused on the surrounding area he looked for the subtle clues for life. Finding nothing nearby he reached out farther across the desert wastes. As he did so his vision changed. Gone was the harsh desert only to be replaced by a lush and thriving jungle. Life was everywhere he looked. The humidity of the jungle hit him as it was such a contrast to he dry air of the desert.
He looked around and all he could see was the immense life that was there before him. He reached out for a plant that was within arms reach. When his fingers intersected the plant leaf the feeling changed.
Loss.
The sense of loss like one he had never felt before washed over him. The lush jungle faded before him. What caused it he didn't know. opening his eyes he realized he was down to one knee. The surroundings was that of the cart and his friends though the sounds of the jungle remained for a few seconds. He shook his head in an attempt to clear it trying to focus on what he had seen. The details were to hazy. He wasn't able to pick anything out. **"Well that wasn't what I had in mind."** He said through the dryness of his throat which brought forward a small cough.

Tar'ja had been silent, doing her best to focus her ears and eyes on the horizon and anything the wind could tell her. The minute she had spotted something and yelled her findings the others were up and looking. The Jedi beside her had mentioned taking a moment to find life; find life? how? but his eyes closed and he seemed to relax beside her.
Though she continued to search for more signs and information to give to the team she still looked over to the human beside her. It took some time but she thought...no...no it was probably just the suns and the heat playing with her mind. She shakes her head, her lekku twitching under the cloak she hadn't taken off. The dewback was looking nervous, her pale eyes turn to it, watching the movements of it's head and body; maybe...no...no what could make that noise though?
She heard a gasp, one she knew was there as it came from beside her, and turned in time to see the human fall to one knee. Her hand moves to rest on his shoulder "are you alright Chase?" curious..was this normal or abnormal when one was searching for life; how did he search for life though with his eyes closed? Her attention wavers again to the dewback; hallucination or not, it was better to report everything then with-hold information that could save their own lives. She turns back to look to the woman "I hear howling on the wind, the dewback is nervous; I do not know if it is the suns that play with my mind but we should be on guard."

Naryen looked over the scene with clinical detachment with an accellerated sense of urgency. Everything was there that should be there given the evidence thus far, the fortunate coords from the Jawa seemed to have helped a great deal. All that was left now was to follow the ice spore droppings to their nest, so to speak. A slight twinge off loss from her home at that reference would sour her expression and aura but would be put aside rather quickly.
She was watching forward, with Kasga, as they went. **"Onward, it seems."** though she would keep looking to the sides to see if there were survivors defending themselves from scavangers and desert pirates.
Between the irritating noises from the 2 beasts, (Chase & the Dewback) ((OOC: Ha. )) Tar'jas mention of howling was the first indication Naryen had of anything other than standard crash trace.
If the path needed to be cleared or scouted then Naryen would look at Chase with partially feined irritation at the drama and would then ask Tar'ja **"Can you hear from where the howling is coming from?"**

Dexter gets of the and begins searching the wreckage. "Man this thing really came apart. If any one lived through it the desert has claimed them." Dexter picks up random pieces to see if he can figure out what part of the ship they came from. "So I guess we need to find this cargo or whatever we where hired to find. Problem is it could be anywhere." Dexter continues to move toward what he thinks is the center of the crash site. "You guys coming along or what?" Dexter looks back at his friends.

Chase heard Tar'ja's question. The concern in her voice was there as she rested a hand on his shoulder. Taking a breath he stood resting one of his own hands atop of hers. He listened and looked around as the others talked about the uneasiness of the area. He felt it too. Caution was on the wind as they all looked around trying to figure out where the sound, howling, was coming from.
**"Yeah I'm alright. I felt…"** He looked sideways at Deidra not sure if he should say anything but threw that thought out the airlock. **"There was a disturbance in the Force here."**  He looked around at the trail the ship left. **"A great loss of life possibly."** He sighed. **"I'm still pretty new at this. But I also saw a lush jungle teeming with life before the feeling of loss hit me. I can't explain it."**
When Dex hopped down off the cart and started walking along ahead searching wreckage pieces he simply shook his head as he rubbed the back of his neck. He looked at Deidra a crooked smile was on his face as he had seen her reaction before whhe the Bothan had just gone off walking doing his own thing. **"As much as you may dislike me for being a Jedi. We probably agree that he's going to end up getting himself killed if he keeps walking off like that."**
Chase reached down to make sure his heavy DL-44 was ready to go if any problems arose.

"I don't have a death wish my friend just trying to get everything into propestive. I am more then a pretty face and charm." Dexter picks up other pieces of wreckage, looking it over. "Unfortately I am a little out of my element but never hurts to learn new skills." Dex continues looking around.

Tar'ja watches the emotions on the Jedi's features as he looks over to the other human woman before speaking. So this...Force thing..it told him in imagery that a large amount of life was lost? She frowns and looks to the woman to gauge her reaction.
She was lost in thought of the imagery and missed the bothan's leaving; "As much as you may dislike me for being a Jedi. We probably agree that he's going to end up getting himself killed if he keeps walking off like that." She blinks in surprise, that was the first time since the bar that he had actively tried to speak to the woman. Again her eyes travel to the woman ready to run interference should she try to attack him or...something.
She stretches her hearing though to try and find where the howling was coming from.

Kasga looks down at the glazed path the crashing ship took. The dewback gets nervous and Kasga's fear picks up. *Who knows what's out there now. If only I had a scope or some electrobinocs.* Dexter hops down from the cart and walk out onto the debris field chatting amongst himself. Kasga keeps his eyes wandering the horizon looking for threats.
Eventually, his nervousness gets the better of him. His voice quavers as he says, **"Come on back. Let's keep to the cart until we get to the end of the crash path. We can just skirt the edge until we get to the end then venture in on foot. If anyone has a pair of electrobinoculars, we could use that to scope out debris."**

The small shards do not seem to bother the dewback, protected by a thick hide and scales it trudges onward. Continuing to follow the trail everyone keeps a sharp eye on the surrounding. Chase even readies his blaster preparing for the worse. Further down the trial of wreckage the debre gets larger and larger. With Dexter searching the ground you slow the dewback up some to keep the Bothans pace.
All around is evidence of the crash scattered debre, impacted dunes and glass shards all this after a sand storm. Trying to put the though of what this must have looked like before the storm your group continues on in silence. Dexter notices another panel half buried with more writing on it. Motioning to the group Dexter moves to investigate reaching down to pull the panel from the sands.
Again the winds chant with an ere howl both far in the distance and all around making it impossible to determine the source. These desert winds pick up for miles on end traversing boundaries and boarders alike. As the howl winds through the cart you are reminded of the many hostile beasts on this planet and others.
Dexter tugs at the panel releasing it from its sandy prison. The panel and the lettering looks very similar to the panel found back at the market place. Firmly entrenched into the sand the Bothan pulls with both hands.
In an eruption of sand and howling the panel lets go its grip the momentum throwing the Bothan on his rear. Around him the sand continues to burst off the dune showing the surprised Bothan. Within the column for erupting sand a blurred humanoid figure can be seen. Raised above its head a curved club like weapon.
Posed to strike the raider blends into the surrounding sands. The sudden blur of motion catching many of you off guard as the raider bursts out of its hiding place. Its reasonable to guess that its garb is colored to blend into the surrounding sands making it difficult to spot let alone define.
((This is the surprise round :P, only Chase and Kasga have weapons ready. Tar`ja and Kasga are not surprised having been watching Dexter intently when the attack occurred.

Grab your blaster and kill him before he kills you!"* The thought racing throw his mind. His own screaming blocking out any other sounds as he scrambles to grab his blaster. Pushing himself back trying to get out of the reach of his attacker.

**In the Tatooine deep desert, with criminals and outlaws, how far have you come now little girl.**
Naryen watches Dexter hop down and examine the some of the wreckage "Man this thing really came apart. If any one lived through it the desert has claimed them." "So I guess we need to find this cargo or whatever we where hired to find. Problem is it could be anywhere." "You guys coming along or what?" She chuckles, enjoying Dexters humour.
The pause in Chases speach with Tar'ja catches Naryens attention "As much as you may dislike me for being a Jedi." Her eyes widen at this rather surprising challenge. ***You think this is the time?*** "We probably agree that he's going to end up getting himself killed if he keeps walking off like that."
While still looking at Dexter she pitches her voice for Chase, so the others on the cart can hear her easily. **"If you think that's the problem I have with you then we do need to have a talk,"** She turns to Chase and looks him in the eyes, hers cold and hard. **"Later."** Her eyes then look to Tar'ja who is still rather close to him, then to her colar, with a slight scowl. She glances down in quick thought then back up at Chase, eyes even harder as another thought emerges for her to consider. ***Did you…?***
Dexter replies "Gee, Chase I didn't know you cared." Dex chuckles a little. "I don't have a death wish my friend just trying to get everything into propestive. I am more then a pretty face and charm. Unfortately I am a little out of my element but never hurts to learn new skills." Naryen can't help but smile at the welcome distraction and glancing over her shoulder back to Dexter with relief. ***Looks like that will have to wait too.***
She then looks from Tar'jas expression of concentration, as she listens to the howls, to Kasga, his voice betraying some nervousness as he says, "Come on back. Let's keep to the cart until we get to the end of the crash path. We can just skirt the edge until we get to the end then venture in on foot. If anyone has a pair of electrobinoculars, we could use that to scope out debris."
**"Agreed"** Naryen replies as she turns to call Dexter back as another howl drifts over the dunes. That's when she realizes something. ***It's pitched so that it's hard to get a direction on it.*** Her expresion hardens as she does an assessment of the layout and their position quickly looking around with a new perspective. ***It's a coordination call!*** Out of trained reflex her hand quickly goes for her hip holster for her sidearm as she starts to call out to the others **"Amb… "**
Naryen glances down, stymied, and cursing. Her hip pouch was not where her holster would be. She looks up to see sand erupting into the air near Dexter as she pulls her pistol free and setting it to kill too late to take advantage of the Raiders rather dramatic entrance to shoot it. A cloak the same color as the sand, and what could be a moisture capture mask covering its face, it towered over the fallen Dexter as it snarled and wielded a staff of some kind, similar coloring to the mask.
(( OOC: There that should cover your post Tru.

**The problem with women who have daggers for eyes.**
Dexter's humor had them all grinning. Seeing Deidra smiling he decided to breach the ice front. **"As much as you may dislike me for being a Jedi…"** He saw her eyes widen and knew it was the wrong thing to say but he continued anyway. **"We probably agree that he's going to end up getting himself killed if he keeps walking off like that."**
He didn't look at her but the feeling her got from her through the Force and seeing her body language said enough. With her voice seemingly pitched so that all on the cart could hear she addressed him. "If you think that's the problem I have with you then we do need to have a talk," He watched her turn and her blue eyes, cold and hard fell on him.
**"What is your prob…"**
"Later." She said and he didn't get a chance to finish. He was about to have it out with her here an now. The look in his own eyes was equally as hard. He saw her look at Tar'ja who stood close by. A scowl appeared on her face as it lowered only to raise again. This time he saw that look in her eyes, one that preludes an attack. He stood with her off to his right,his six foot plus frame dwarfed her yet she didn't back down. ***What is she thinking in that Imperial brain of hers?*** He thought as he stood relaxed.
Dexter's voice cut the tension and Chase saw Deidra smile at the Bothan's words. Something was off, didn't feel right. It wasn't the Force it was his gut. Looking at the others he could see it in their expressions and in the tone of their voices. Out of instinct he reached down undid the leather snap that held his DL-44 in its holster and rested his hand comfortably on his grip. He was listening to the howls like the others as he raised the weapon from its holster. **"Something isn't right."** He said under his breath.
Not a second later the sand erupts up and out near where Dex is trying to loosen a piece of debris from the sand. The howling that they had heard let itself be known. Dex flew back on to his rear not by an attack do much but by shear surprise. With Dex in such close proximity to the sand person, firing on it would be dangerous. He took one step and leaped off the cart shouting as he did so. **"Watch for others there's bound to be more!"** He made his way for Dex as fast as he could in the sand. ***If he can't get his blaster free in time he won't stand a chance in a melee.*** He thought.
**"Dex back this way!"** He shouted again as he ran for the Bothan who was clearly at a disadvantage.
OOC: double move to Dex if possible. Not sure how far he is away. If I can't reach him on this round then another move or full move till I do. Now if any others pop up in my way then Chase will attempt to blow by them to get to Dex hoping the others with cover him. If I do reach on the second round a charge attack for a +2 to hit and +2 to damage. Melee would be first choice.

"If you think that's the problem I have with you then we do need to have a talk,"

"Later."
Tar'ja rolled her eyes, honestly what was wrong with the two of them; fighting at a time like this. The twi'lek's pale eyes scan the sands while her ears listen for a direction to go off of. Out of the corner of her eye she could see the woman looking to her collar and frowning. What did that mean? a frown draws at the twi'lek's features, did she disapprove? not that it mattered really, but what was that look for? "What..." she had started to say when something just felt...wrong. "Something isn't right." Chase said, the words taken right from her own mind it seemed, another frown as her fingers trail to her blaster, eyes looking at the sand just as a pile erupts into a..person..thing. The woman beside her didn't even have to finish her sentence for them all to know what it was.
She was off, hardly even waiting to see if the other two would follow as she ran for the back of the cart to help their companion, her hand finding comfort with the hilt of her blaster in it.

Kasga had been on lookout as the dewback ambled along. Sometimes paranoia pays off. Gripping his looted rifle, Kasga draws down on the Tuskan. He hesitates worrying about shooting Dexter as he weaves away from his attacker. Waiting for the right moment, Kasga sees it when Dexter seperates from the Tuskan. Relaxed, he squeezes the trigger...

Having erupted out of hiding the Tusken raider catches many of your group by surprise. Still howling the barbaric raider seems to stare intently at Dexter through its protective goggles. Dexter pushes back sliding through the sand to gain some distance from the hostile humanoid.
Seeing the danger to his companion Kasga readies his rifle. The outcome of this encounter look obvious, blood will be spilled today. Checking Dexters position the Bothan was wise enough to lead only a short distance from the cart, only five metres separate the cart from Dexter.
Tar`ja reacts quickly leaping from the cart to aid her friend. Pushing aside thoughts of curiosity as to why she would feel loyalty to a group she had only just meet, Tar`ja then finds herself pushing out thoughts of Chases eyes. With practiced efficiency the woman's facial muscles tighten as she takes on a familiar focus allowed through her training. The sand itself resists her movements as Tar`ja jumps of the cart sinking into the deep dune sands.
With his curved club waving in the air the Tusken raider bellows outs howls of rage. Below the Tusken the startled Dexter scuffles attempting to gain a small amount of comfort. Dexters feeling of comfort is short lived as the raider almost glides through the sands easily keeping pace with the Bothans movements. With surprising speed Dexter reaches for his blaster and fires. The Tusken raider begins his own attack bringing the curved club in a downward ark.
Dexter squeezes off a shot scoring a hit on the Tusken raider. Howling out in pain the Tusken takes a hit full in the chest. A small wisp of smoke smolders from the fresh carbon score on the Tuskens chest. As Dexter squeezes the trigger the raiders curved club races towards the Bothan at break neck speeds, Dexter finds himself cringing at the thought of being struck. The weapon smashes into the ground beside Dexter, spraying fresh sand over the Bothan.
Deidra draws her weapon and holds aim towards Dexters assailant. The two seem to blur in the heat making it difficult to pick out targets. Now with Tar`ja entering the fray and Chase looking to rush in the former imperial holds back watching out over the scene and beyond for other possible threats.
As Tar`ja had done before him Chase jumps off the cart sinking into the sand. Dexter is only five meters away from the cart but the effort of rushing through the sands is much harder then it first looked. Chase reaches Dexters side just after the Tuskens club smashes into the sand next to the Bothan.
Kasga watches the skirmish between Dexter and the Tusken though the sights of his rifle. Seeing that Dexter will be unable to move out of the Tuskens range the Duros steadies his rifle and takes aim. Kasga fires and the blast echos across the dunes. The shoot slams into the Tuskens shoulder spinning the raider around and to the group face first.
Tar`ja draws her blaster but slumps her aim toward the ground. With Dexters attacker face down in the sand Tar`ja moves to investigate the ambushers fate. After the Tusken fell its howls end, but the winds continue to carry the chilling sound.
Uncertain your group looks to each other then back to the Tusken. The dewback continues to whip its tail back and forth snapping out its tongue, so agitated it begins to shake the cart. As if to answer the Tuskens call two large beasts climb over the dune. Obviously domesticated the spiral horned beasts of burden wear harnesses and tan leather sadels over their long shaggy fur. On the backs of each ride twin Tusken warriors wielding long rifles.
The first Tusken directs the movements of the great beasts while the passengers take aim at your group. Diedra reacts to the new comers by taking aim and firing at the hostiles. The two passengers fire booming rifles, taking aim at tar`ja and Chase the closest to their alie.
Diedras shoot goes wide over head. The shoot for Chase falls short impacting the sand between his feet more like an object then a blaster shot. Tar`ja feels a sting on her left leg as something very fast hits her and moves past into the sand.

Chase reached Dex a split second after the Raider missed its strike on the Bothan. Chase heard the curved club digits way into the sand. Despite being shot by the Bothan, the attacker was still in full fight.
With a strong hand Chase grabbed the little spy by the clothes that covered his shoulder and lifted/helped Dex to his feet. **"Come on Dex to your feet."** Barely a second after the words left his mouth Chase saw the raider spin and fall as the report from the blaster rifle wielded by Kasga rang out.
Looking around Chase didn't see anymore. **"Only one? Doesn't make sense."**
Over a dune 4 newcomers arrive riding two beasts. Their long weapons fire and Chase feels the sand kick up from between his legs. **"There."** He says to Tar'ja and points at the new hostiles. A second later he hears Kasga shout about getting cover.
Chase raises his blaster as he yells back. **"Yeah like there's an abundance of it out here."** He says somewhat dryly.
He let his DL-44 answer back to the raiders first volley.

Tar'ja had decided she didn't like sand, it made her sink and it seemed to be gravitating to places on it's own. Yes, she hated sand.
At least the raider fell but something wasn't right, the howl was still in the air and, a glance to the beast, showed it was still agitated. Which further added to her 'something is not right' idea. And low and behold..sometimes she didn't like being right.
Her blaster was up as the raiders came into view but a stinging pain suddenly shot up her leg, she tilted to the ground but forced herself to stay up and keep the blaster at the ready even as the blood began to trail down her leg, another wound to add to her slowly growing list.
"Incoming fire! Scratch for cover!" her eye twitches as she calls back "We Know that Kasga!!" She levels the barrel of her blaster at a raider and fires off a shot before trying to back up to the cart and cover.

Steely eyed and all business she commits herself with practiced ease. With already plenty of chatter to advertise their actions to the raiders, Naryen decides to clam up and just get down to it.
Naryen watches, feeling rather helpless, as 2 mounted raiders stalk over the edge of the dune and use what look to be large bore long muzzled slug coughers on her companions. ***Probably very hearty tools in desert conditions too.***
She looked, once again, around her for any sign of more attackers. Seeing none she takes her cue from Kasga & focusses on the rider closest to her. Dropping to one knee on the back of the cart to steady her shot, and provide a smaller cross section, she lines up and squeezes off a charge @ their attackers.

Dexter scrambles to his feet still a little shaken. Tusken`s bursting out of the sand and riding great beasts it not an average day. Blaster in hand the Bothan fires a the nearest driver. The blast slams into the raiders shoulder, the Tusken visibly shakes his head and howls in anger at the pain.
With the new foes Chase now takes aim at the closest Tusken gunner. Ignoring the fallen Tusken scout Chase takes a steady aim and fires. The shot hits home impacting the Tuskens side. What must be Tusken curses stream out directed at Chase.
Following Chases example Kasga quickly snaps off a shot at the second Tusken gunner. The rifle blast booms across the sands tagging the Tusken in the chest. More Tusken curses follow as both Tuskens sway slightly in the saddle, injured but still in the fight.
Tar`ja takes the opportunity to fire on a wounded Tusken.Her shot blazes past Kasgas target forcing the Tusken to quickly duck. The action almost knocks the Tusken from the beasts back. As quickly as the sands will allow Tar`ja moves towards the cover of the cart.
Deidra comfortable in the cart takes aim at the group of Tusken`s. Hoping to capitalize on both Kasga`s and Tar`ja`s injured target Deidra squeezes off a shot. The shot goes wide missing its target and flying uselessly off into the desert.
Just as Diedra`s shot passes behind her target the closest rider gives the beast a kick. The beast turns and starts back over the dune from where it came with speed one would not expect from a creature its size. The beast with riders disappears behind the dune and out of sight.
The remaining Tusken`s spur their mount on as well. Instead of following their companions these Tusken charge straight at Chase and Dexter. A roar erupts, though it is unclear if its the beast or Tusken`s. Chase`s now tiny form in comparison to the beast becomes shadowed as it bears down on the human. With full force Chase is slammed by the beasts spiral horns. The force knocks Chase back, the jedi uses the momentum turning into a back flip and landing on his feet. The gunner swings its rifle at Dexter, though the Bothan easily side steps the clumsy attack.

The Force was with him as Chase took aim at the raider. Despite being in a life and death situation he was calm. Shots rang out from their group with several scoring hits on the ambushers.
**"Nice shooting."** He said as it looked like the raiders had had enough when one of the creatures turn and moved off over the dune carrying its two riders. Only to Chase's surprise when the other one charged. Having no where to go with his movement limited in the sand he prepared for the hit. With a roaring in his ears from either the beast or the riders he was slammed by the beast. Training took over and instead of being sent sprawling he used the momentum to turn a back flip and land on his feet close to the animal.
As he landed the blue blade of his lightsaber sprang to life with its tell-tale *snap-hiss*. His blaster landed to his left atop the sand, discarded for a weapon that was more suited for a melee. His connection with the Force seemed to increase with his Jedi weapon in hand. Gone was the friction between him and Deridra, gone were the emotions that he was developing for Tar'ja. They were replaced with the here and now determination of life and death for him and his companions.
Instantly he lashed out at the two raiders and their mount. If he couldn't hit the one carrying the slug thrower he'dtake out the mount forcing them to their feet making the odds a bit more even.

The blaster lowers as her leg wanted to give out to the sand below, a sigh escaping the lips of the twi'lek as, at least, they were retreating by the look of the first one, but her pale eyes look with horror as the second raider does not turn, but rather charges for Chase.
She couldn't react fast enough, could only watch as the raider hit the male she had begun to develop something for; it was the most remarkable thing though, he didn't fall, rather flipped in midair to land back on his feet. Another sigh of relief, but then...*snap-hisss* Bright blue light emits from his hand, no...no something -in- his hand..
Was this weapon and the steely calm she could see in his posture and eyes even from her position be what was causing the human female so much hate and distress? It must be the legendary weapon that was all anyone spoke of when speaking of Jedi, the few people she had spied on that spoke of them all said the same things about them; the glow sticks..
This wasn't something to be feared...not when one was on their side but even then this was fascinating and something to be admired!
*Holding for a clear shot*

**In the Tatooine deep desert facing nomadic hunters with outlaws watching her back.**
Naryen was upset she missed her shot while the others were handling themselves so well. Her frustration was stymied as one of the beasted surged forward, driving Chase into the air. With such mass behind the curled horns and the speed of the impact Naryen was suprised, and frankly impressed, to see Chase twist in the air draw and even try a counter the attack with such aparant ease.
Then her senses registered the sound and glow from Chases hand, reflected in his eyes. That blasted blade and the arrogance and carelessness it seems to inspire in it's wielder. She forced the emerging scowl from her face and mind as she grudgingly ceded the point that this is probably an appropriate time to reveal it and moved to take advantage of the opportunity it again presented to bolster her confidence and that of the others.
She stood, rather histrionically, sweeping her cloak around her to in a wide dramatic arc to draw as much attention of the raiders as possible. Pointing to the retreating beast with her pistol while looking intensly at the remaining nomads her voice, pitched to carry, moved across the dunes like a force of nature. A cool breeze cutting through a scorched landscape.
**"They're going for help."** The smile that came across her face, at this, was feral and chilling to an observer. **"Take them out!"** she makes a dismissive gesture of finality and brings her pistol back to bear on the rider.
***Even if they don't understand my words there's no mistaking a show of confidence like that.*** The smile on her face beaming at the riders should complete the performance.

Kasga's target ran off in a hurry. Then the other one charged. *Not at the cart!! How does something that big move so fast?* Turning toward the other Bantha, Kasga searches for another target. *Ferglutz, Chase and Dex are too close. The gunner it is.* Lifting his rifle, Kasga squeezes off two shots in rapid succession toward the other gunner.

Dexter shocked at the sudden wall of bantha blocking his path takes aim at the driver. Letting a shot off the Bothan curses at the Tusken as the blast drives the Tusken forward in his saddle. Winded the Tusken barely avoids a blast to the head.
With his sudden reaction Chase is reminded of his training of his master, it has been some time since the human had to use his skills. Pushing thoughts of his past life aside Chase spins the saber around coming into an upward thrust. Chases blade meets the Tusken`s chest as it was forced forward by Dexters attack. The saber sizzles as it burns through flesh and cloth.
Next Kasga`s rifle booms another blast which echos across the desert floor. The gunner takes a hit to its side, the force of the blast almost knocks the Tusken from the saddle.
Tar`ja holds steady blaster ready she waits for a clear shot, or for the second Bantha to come barreling back over the dune. Scanning the are Tar`ja keeps watch.
Everyone hears Deidra shout out "They`re going for help." and "Take them out!" So firm is her resolve of the situation most likely a result of years of military training the woman`s words give you all focus as a team you all know what to do.
On the Bantha the gunner looks hurt he will not with stand another assault. The rider scans your group and spurs his Bantha on. With full force the Bantha picks up speed following after the first. The Tuskens look as if to retreat.
((Cart 0 meters with Deidra and Kasga
Five meters out Dexter

full retreat ... meters from the cart the bantha rider (other bantha unknown)
Round two:
-dexter attacks
-Chase attacks
-Tar`ja hold action (you can add a move now if you chose)
-Deidra special actions
-bantha riders full move, this does provoke attacks of opportunities let me know in a post if you wish to use it.

When Chase saw the raider lean forward in an effort to avoid the blaster shot from Dexter he saw his opening and sprang. The humming coming from his blade increased as it's movement increased as he spun it. With a slight change of of his grip he brought the blade up, thrusting it. Chase felt it as the blade cleaved through the raider. The smell of brunt flesh and clothing carried on the desert winds.
Kasga's rifle retorts and the other rider falls forward in the saddle. Chase hears Deidra shout from the cart calling for them to take them out. Chase held himself there ready to act if they should keep up the attack. Clearly the raiders had bitten off more than they could chew this time. ***Will they run or stay to the end?*** He thought as he held his humming lightsaber in front if him.
When he saw the beast turn he stepped forward to strike but held off. If they were running all the better. The less blood spilled here in the sandy wastes the better. Besides the less of a body trail they left was a good thing. As the beast sped away Chase relaxed his stance and looked around. Dexter looked alright as did Deidra and Kasga on the cart. When he looked at Tar'ja he saw her favoring her leg. Looking more closely he saw blood trickling down her leg.
Wanting to get to her quickly he extended his hand towards his dropped blaster that was now several meters away due to his tossing it after being hit by the raiders beast. Surprisingly with minimal effort through the Force he brought the weapon to his outstretched hand and then holstered it. Weather it was his current focus or his increasing ability he wasn't sure.
He looked at Dex as he walked to Tar'ja. **"Lets go Dex. We shouldn't stay any longer then needed they could be back anytime and with more numbers."**
Coming up on Tar'ja he closed down his lightsaber but kept it in hand. Concern in his eyes. **"Are you alright? You're bleeding."** He said to his friend. Friend? Was she just a friend? No she wasn't. She was becoming more than that. As he looked at her he realized just how much he cared for her and it showed in his eyes as he looked into hers.

Tar'ja lowers her blaster as the raider rides off, she would have gone after it, just to make sure the job was finished but she didn't exactly feel that her leg would take her far nor that sand was a good way to heal.
She looks back to the voice of the other woman than over to the two others by the cart, everyone seemed alright. Content with her visual apprasal of the others she looks finally to Chase as he comes up to her, catching his blaster flying to his hand from the sand and the saber being extinguished. "Are you alright? You're bleeding." She looks up to his eyes, she was finding she liked those eyes more and more, then his words registered.
The twi'lek's features take on confusion, looking down to see a trickle of blood moving down her pant leg "So I am.." she says and sighs "Another wound to add to the growing list." She offers a smirk, little binding and it would be fine, no need to make too much of a big deal about it, maybe she could hide it from the woman...
She points at the blaster at his side "how did you move it without touching it?" Her hand then takes his that held his saber, examining it though not touching "and where did the light go?" She was fasinated! these things that people spoke of in whispers were real then! but they didn't seem so terrifying when you were not on the receaving end of it.

The other Bantha went running off as well. Kasga heard Deirdra's warning that more Tuskan's could be on the way. *We'll need to be sure to post a guard as we search the wreckage and from high ground.*
Dierdra's attitude about finishing them off the raiders is out of place. *Bluster, I hope.* Kasga eased back into the cart, taking his eyes off the gun sights and scanning the horizon for more raiders.

Dexter looks at his friend. "Right behind you." Dex follows chase back towards the cart. "You know if I didn't know better I would say that the galaxy has it in for me. First the Crimelord and his guards, Bounty hunters, and now Sandpeople. Yep I will be glad to be off this dust ball and have space under me."

### **Rebaav** (2009-10-22 20:05:40)

**In the Tatooine deep desert killing nomadic hunters with outlaws at her side.**
Naryen watched, again, as a Glowing Blade of Death and Chaos is again brought forth to remove a life from the galaxy. For all they know these were simple scavengers that came acrosss mana from the heavens that could be bartered for supplies and medicines.
She turns away, for an instant, as she focuses, upon the source of that bitter rage and calls it out. ***Or they're ravenous canibals and a lightsaber is simply a tool.*** She looks back and wears her mask of bravado that sometimes command has demanded of her to ensure lives are not wasted.
Naryen stands on the cart, beaming confidence and wide challenging eyes, as the rider on the second beast looks over the group. ***That's right size us up & see that we are beyond you!*** She remains that way as the rider directs its beast at a pace their cart critter, even untethered, could likely not match. The combination of a lightsaber, and hopefully her performance directed at the riders, should keep them away.
She then steps forward, and places a hand on Kasgas shoulder. With confidence laced with pride she says **"Well done."** then with a reminicant sigh **"If only we had some grenades we could set off at their heels to show them what they'd face should they return to face us."** she pats his shoulder with an **"Ah well."** and hops down from the cart. **"We should get going so that when they return in larger numbers we are far from here."**. She walks past their dewback, offering it a reasuring pat and rub and looks up to the rest of the group.
... to see Chases sidearm fly from the sand, through the air, to his outstretched hand, with the same casual ease as displayed when he ended the life of a Gran, back in town, that was also just trying to survive in this galaxy.
Naryen stops abruptly in her tracks, back now set and rigid, as she watches at Chases eyes pour into Tar'jas. The look in the Twi'leks eyes, awe and wonder and... *willing* surrender? Naryen looks from her face, following her lines of posture, to the collar, a common Twi'lek accessory refering to their culture of indentured servitude, to her leg, where a color rather out of place was just starting to show.
***A tool of death in the hands of a posturing man-child looking to impress his next conquest right when she's feeling vulnerable!?***
A flood of rage, at herself for trusting again as much as at this Jedi for using his tools of mental manipulation to both impress and kill, as he she recalls his snipe and the look of challenge in his eyes just as they are attacked. Her eyes are wide and wild as her hands lock to fists and begin to tremble at her sides, her mouth set and tense. The rushing sound in her ears is the same from her last day at home; the sound of adernaline and death of those that placed they're trust in others in their time of need.
It lasts but a moment then she turns her head to one side to grab that vicious thought stream, beats it to submission and stuffs it in a box labeled *Later!*.
The expression wipes from her face as she calls on her training and scrubs her emotions from her features and voice. Harnessing her need to protect what little ties to home she has left, she steps forward with an air of projected confidence. **"We need to get going before they return in… larger numbers."** she chokes back the word "force".
Glancing down at Tar'jas leg, with a frown of concern, Naryen looks breifly to Dexter for inspiration that manifests as a smirk, and a nod to him, then says to Tar'ja with her head tilted in a freindly pose **"What is it with you and attracting danger."** with a smile and a shake of the head of "what are we going to do with you" she glances at Chase eyes for the point then barrels on, **"Tar'ja, I understand your wanting to be self reliant but I'd like to get you on that cart and look at that so we can move on."** and extends a hand to Tar'ja.
Turning to look at Chase **"We really need to move on."**. She then considers something, looking towards the retreating riders. **"Could you burn any blood she drops in the sand. Speed may not be the only reason they use those beasts."**

Curiosity came to a slow halt as she turns, the awe and curious expression gone in favor of the usual cool demeanor. The Twi'lek looks again to her leg and rolls her eyes, a faint display that even with the woman she was beginning to relax into the idea of trusting her "It follows me it seems." She shrugs a shoulder and offers a faint chuckle.
"Tar'ja, I understand your wanting to be self reliant but I'd like to get you on that cart and look at that so we can move on." A frown now, that could almost be taken condescendingly, her lekku twitch with her thoughts old memories driving up at the words even if it wasn't the intent.
Her eyes narrow to a hard look, her shoulders roll back as her body sinks slightly to a near fighting posture, her weight shifting to her left leg, oddly the injured one and though it makes the wound bleed a bit more she shows no signs of registering any pain.
The gaze stays on the woman, though whether it was the woman she saw or something else was something only she would know though her thoughts were far from having a tea party and trailed more on the side of what was dripping down her leg from her wound. She stands there, as though in duel waiting for the right moment that she would draw her blaster and fire at whatever demon it was that she saw before her...
...The lilac skinned and leather clad lekku rise slightly off her back but fall as she only turns slowly, watching the woman until her head could no longer keep her within her sights and turns it to go to the cart, her walk as though it hadn't happened.
She would climb into the cart and take a seat, glancing to the wound with a frown her thoughts still on reigning the emotion back

Chase heard Dex's reply and grinned as he walked towards Tar'ja. **"I think you're right Dex the quicker we're off this planet the better."** Nothing further was said till he reached her. His inquiry to her injury brought forth a smirk and a joke from her. It was then that he knew that she was alright.
She then pointed to his blaster that he had re-holstered. "How did you move it without touching it?" She said as she reached for his other hand that still held the hilt of his lightsaber. "And where did the light go?" He saw the wonder in her eyes. Seeing things like this were a thing of the past. Ever since the fall of the Republic when the Emperor solidified his powerful grip on the galaxy, the Jedi have fallen into myth and charlatans. There were others out there like him. And like him they were also hunted.
**"Well you see…"** He was cut off by Deidra That same feeling emanating from her as before.
"We need to get going before they return in... larger numbers."
Chase nodded with the Imperials assessment. She continued on. "What is it with you and attracting danger." At this Chase smiles remembering the joke that Tar'ja had just made a moment ago but his smile fades slightly when he see Deidra looking at him as if to make a point to her words. "Tar'ja, I understand your wanting to be self reliant but I'd like to get you on that cart and look at that so we can move on."
It was with those words that he felt the shift in Tar'ja's emotions and then saw it reflected in her posture. He wasn't sure what set Tar'ja off like this. Something though struck a cord in the Twi'lek. He wanted to reach out to her but held himself in check. She wasn't a kid that needed to be led by the hand. He saw the strong, confident Twi'lek stand there before him. That strength was one of the things that he liked about her. He lekku rose and fell as she turned away from Deidra. He watched her go to the cart guessing that she was gong to get up on her own.
The former Imperial's voice brought his head back to her. "We really need to move on." He follows her gaze to the retreating riders.
**"I agree."** He said sincerely with a nod.
"Could you burn any blood she drops in the sand. Speed may not be the only reason they use those beasts." Deidra finished.
Chase looked to the blood trail that Tar'ja had left. He nodded his head slightly. **"Yeah that would work. It will create pockets of glass though when the blade intersects the sand. But that could be written of as the heat of the crashing ship glassing the sand."** He steps away go go where Tar'ja was shot and with a slight movement of his thumb the blue blade of his weapon springs back into being.
Following the blood path he makes sure to hit all the spots in the sand that were colored with her blood. It didn't take long and as he passed the dead raider Chase heard Kasga ask about searching the body. With a nod he knelt down and went through the dead beings clothing looking for anything of interest or value. When he was finished he went back to destroying the blood trail.
Back on the cart Chase put his weapon away as he went to his pack. He looked at Tar'ja. She hadn't moved from where she sat after climbing back onto the cart. The emotions were still there but she was reigning them back in. Reaching into his pack he pulled forth his medkit. He looked at Deidra and Kasga. **"Back on the path to the ship are we then?"** He said in passing as he took a few steps and offered the kit to Tar'ja. **"Would you like this to take a look at it. I'd hate to see it get infected. From the looks of the blood on your leg it looks like the went through and through."** She she asked for help he would gladly give it. If not then he would keep watch for any other surprises that this forsaken planet had to offer.

While everyone keeps watch over the area Chase sets out to clean up the trail of blood. An easy task which is completed quickly. Checking over the Tusken scout Chase finds a few meager belongings, his weapon the curved club (a gaderffii, but your group does not know that), several dried and salted strips of lizard meat, a necklace made from the spin of a small animal along its length are small carved skulls, and its cloths.
Deidra tends to Tar`ja`s wound though very little compassion is expressed from the woman Tar`ja gets the feeling the aid is offered out of necessity for efficiency. With her wound bandaged and Chase back on the cart Tar`ja sees no reason why the jedi could not check the wound over again, if not for any reason other the to be closer to the human. Strange if this what father warned her of, getting close to anyone is this weakness?
Chase on the other hand feels alive really alive. Every breath brings a flood of energy to his body something he had not felt since training, since he was last with his master. A flicker of sadness or even guilt flashes in the jedi`s eyes but is quickly dismissed with training, "emotion can lead to the dark side control yourself young Chase." The voice runs through his mind as if it was just spoken so clear as if it was aloud.
Deidra begins to wonder this engagement was sloppy storm troopers would have finished it moved to find the Tusken strong hold and eliminated the threat for good. But as sloppy as it was this team worked very well together, minimal damage and even minimal command they easily turned a potential deadly trap an survived, even a few troopers would have fallen in an skirmish like this.
Kasga motions the beast onward which begins to pull the cart slowly at first. A lot has happened in the last few days finding and losing a brother included. Still scanning the area Kasga finds himself wishing for the ease of the pilot seat, of anything a ship a speeder something with controls. Flying is so much easier so natural.
The Bothan chuckles a little at Deidra`s last comment towards him. Dexter does find himself in difficult situations more then most. It always worried the trained spy as much of his life was spent alone but after this group so quickly came to his aid Dexter feels a little safer knowing that life would be easier with others watching out for him. Something the Bothan would not take lightly, he would do his best to watch over their backs.
Kasga brings the cart to the top of the dune, the same dune the Bantha riders retreated to. Looking over the desert floor the dunes rise and fall like violent waves in an ocean storm. In the distance you cane see the Banthas and riders still running though they had picked up a passenger each. The riders head in the same direction with no intention of slowing. From your vantage point you now see what they where defending. At the bottom of the dune half buried in the sand rests a damaged Yt-1300.
Parts of the ship lay scattered about, but most of the sip looks intact. Kasga can not help but to let out a whistle at the fine design of the ship other designs would not have survived such a crash. The rear engines stand out of the sand at a high 50 degree angle. The upper access portal has been opened, probably by the Tusken`s. On the ground about four meters from the ship a lone body lays face down in the sand.

Dexter follows Chase back to the cart. Climbing back inside he smiles at Deidra's statement. "Danger and me are all to often on a first name bases. I find that universe has this interesting idea that my life should be anything but boring." Looking over at Chase. "Our friend with the shiny stick must think that I have some usefulness cause he keep pulling my furry backside out of fire. For that women every where thank you." Dexter bows to Chase. "And my boss back at Spynet would like the pleasure of being the end of me any how."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-10-24 01:19:20)

Back on the cart tensions were running high. He could still feel the icy coldness coming from Deidra. Something greatly was bothering the Former Imperial and Chase had a feeling that he was at the center of it. He didn't totally buy he words from before the attack but he was sure that there was some sort of basis there. He looked at Tar'ja and smiled. Seeing her smile back sent that kind of shiver down his spine. He liked that feeling. What surprised and delighted him was that what he felt seemed to be reciprocated back from the beautiful Twi'lek. Though she also entered into the tension between him and Deidra. How Tar'ja reacted to Deidra after the quick battle with the raiders left him wondering. He just shook his head. ***Women. Even with all the ability I seem to have a female can still make me scratch my head in confusion when it comes right down to it.***
While he had seen to the blood trail Deidra had den to the wounded, namely Tar'ja. Quick and efficiently the would was looked at and bandaged. But when Chase offered Tar'ja his medkit she had asked if he could check it over again. The look on her face may have held a different intention but Chase simply smiled and nodded.
**"Sure but I'm positive that She did a fine job in taking care of it."** He knelt down in front of her and took her leg gently in his hands. Chase noticed right away that black material of her clothing hugged her lithe shapely legs about as closely as possible. Though due to the wound Deidra had to loosen the lower part some to apply the bandage.
Weather it was the recent battle or the simple case of touching Tar'ja's leg and being close to her again was making him feel really alive. His connection to the Force seemed to be growing every day. Jedi senses that used to not be very reliable were becoming more so. He hadn't really felt like this since Master Garet was gone. With the thought of Garet a quick flicker of sadness, maybe even guilt for not trying to do more to save him from the bounty hunters settled in. Yet as he gently ran his fingers over the soft lilac skin of Tar'ja's leg inspecting the good job that Deidra did on it his training kicked in and dismissed the feelings of sadness and guilt. The voice of Garet rang in his head. "emotion can lead to the dark side control yourself young Chase."
Those words bought forth another question in his mind. What about the feelings he was having for Tar'ja. Did the feelings of joy and happiness, even affection apply in the same sense as those of sadness and guilt. With a slight sigh noticeable to Tar'ja, though she wasn't sure why he did that thought one can always assume, he smiled. ***Maybe it comes down to controlling the emotions. It's ok to have emotions, all of them. From happiness to fear, even anger. Maybe its controlling it is what matters. If you control the emotions verses them controlling you the Dark Side can be avoided.*** After all Master Garet said fear was often a natural response as long as it didn't control one's actions.
His smile continued as he looked at her. **"It's fine. Through and through like I said. Deidra did a fine job taking care of it but I am glad you asked me to look it over."** He gave her a wink as his hands gently replaced the loosened leg fabric around the bandage. **You're amassing quite the array of battle scars."** He teased her as he stood up. He was about to say something about comparing battle scars but for the moment thought better of it. Instead he walked to the edge of the cart where Kasga was guiding the cart ever vigilant in watching for more trouble.
**"Nice shooting back there Kasga. It's good to know that there's a steady trigger finger at one's back when things get dicey."**
As the cart continued along the trail of the crash they crested the dune. The raiders were far off in the distance still running. About to make a comment he spotted what the others probably also saw. It was what they were looking for. The downed ship half buried in the sand.
As Kasga urged the beast and cart forward they spotted debris that had been scattered. Seeing the body lying in the sand Chase pointed. **"There!"** He hopped down quickly.
As he ran to the body he hand fell to his blaster and undid the strap that held it in place. The lessons from the Raiders was still fresh on his mind. Arriving at the body he spoke to the being that laid there as he placed is free hand on the body to turn it over gently. **"Hey we're here to help."**

As Dexter is laughing it up he hears Chase point something out to the rest of them. Looking over at the damaged YT-1300 and the body laying in the sand. "Whoa that is one hell of a pilot to bring it with that little of damage. If they had been any less there wouldn't much more then a crater left." Looking over the at the ship. "Anyone want to check out the ship with me? If the computers are still working we might be able to pull some data off of them." Dexter gets rapped up in the thought of slicing a computer that has something on it that might be of interest. He pulls out the Pocket scrambler that he just got and programs in to work with his. "Chase give me your comm link. I am going to try to make it so we can communicate without other listening in."

As everyone gathers back into the cart following the Tuskan attack, Kasga quips, **""I have an idea. Why don't we all stay in the cart until we find the end of the crash path."** His sarcasm falls on uninterested ears as they go about bandaging Tar'ja.
Chase seems quite energized by the fight. I can relate. It's like coming in off a starship combat mission. The mission is done. I did good and I made it back in one piece. I wonder if the others even recognize it.  At Chase's comment, Kasga responds, **"You're welcome. You'd do the same for me."** His expression goes dead as he recalls that it was Kirn that first said those words to him.
As cart crests the dune and Kasga gets a look at the end of the crash path, he allows his attention to wander from the task of guiding the cart. The crash is a study in starship engineering. He lets out a long low whistle. Burning Stars, if only I could get a ship like that. Slim chance now.
As he guides the cart closer to the ship, he looks around for natural terrain that might provide good cover for the cart and dewback as they perform their search. Considering the previous party of Tuskans, Kasga thinks back about something Deirdra said. Maybe she's right, they might be going for reinforcements. We won't have long before a whole tribe shows up. Ok, cover is not as important as convienence.
He continues rolling plans around in his head, as he guides the cart close in to the crashed ship. Once the cart gets parked nearby, he asks, **"We're going to need to set up overwatch, 'cause those Tuskans will be back before long. Does anyone else know ships well?"** He points toward a high dune near the crash, **"I'd rather be up there. 'Course, if anyone had electrobinocs, that'd help a lot."**

**In the Tatooine deep desert with outlaws watching her back. Avians of a plumage&#8230;**
She nods formally to Chase, as he agrees and proceeds with mopping up Tar'jas blood, though her attention is focussed on the direction the raiders took, a direction they will themselves take in moments. ***Dry winds could carry scents far and if they somehow get her mark…*** she cringes at the possibilities.
As Tar'ja situates herself, then moves to the cart, Naryen keeps her eyes averted, so as not to make the Twi'lek feel that she is being critiqued. ***She's sensitive to being seen as vulnerable. I can relate to that.*** A flash of memories of her Imperial service and then a slight frown; ***Chase must have picked up on that… brash, opportunisitic boy…***
Naryen looks to, then chuckles with a nod, Dexters attitude and interjection, again a welcome effort at boosting morale. **"It seems, my friend, then we are all in like company when it comes to the universe keeping our lives interesting."** A flash of pain and longing show on her face but she powers on trying very hard to enjoy this likely fleeting moment of comraderie. **"You are indeed a man of charms, I'm glad to do what I can so the universe can enjoy you for one more day!"** she smiles again, though it seems slightly forced this time.
She lets Tar'ja walk on her own towards the cart. Seeing the poise and overt display of strength, not favouring the injury in the slightest, Naryen can't help but admire the lines of the Twi'leks form. She recalls some of the Leave stories she overheard from the officers from time to time. She had assumed, then, that they were bluster and lies such that some men tell. Looking at Tar'jas behaviour it provides Naryen with some context.
Her eyes harden introspecively as she hustles after Dexter and Tar'ja to the cart. Once there she patiently yet quickly attends to Tar'jas injury being as thorough as she can given the circumstances in cleaning and evaluating & looking for any sign of additional trouble. **"Thank you for letting me help, Tar'ja. I'm confident you could do this yourself, I just haven't been very useful."** Her own voice, rather conversational and relaxed, suprises her. She recalls the failure to shoot a simple moving target. **"Especially now."** Chase hops on as the cart passes and he finishes with the last of the spots and they all head to the break in the dune.
Naryen looks to him then back to her work on Tar'ja. **"Flechettes can be used to deliver many things to a bloodstream or nervous system."** as she attends to the wound **"If you experience anything out of the ordinary, physical, mental, emotional, please …"** Naryen considers the near pleading tone and, nearly choking on the word, pulls back a little and carefully resets her expression and posture back to something more distant. **"… let me know so I can assist."** a quick, small, almost shy smile and she packs the supplies away and diverts her attention back to the front of the cart and moves to give Tar'ja some privacy.
It was then that the cart came over the dune-break and the crash site, and a body, came into view. The heat made it hard to see details but it was clear that the raiders picked up some allies as they fled.
With a snarl Naryen offers her assesment: **"Forget grenades now I want artillary!"** and her fists ball up, tense she's up next to Kasga before she realizes it. With kit still in hand Naryen hops after Chase, taking his lead, to see what help she can offer.
***So SBC, is this your "Bacta"?*** her expressions is grim.

Tar'ja took a few minutes upon entering the cart to calm herself, regain her composure and ensure that the ghosts of the past were not standing in front of her. She had felt the cart move with the addition of the weight of the others, her leg being tended to by the woman, though it took her a long time before even looking at her.
"Flechettes can be used to deliver many things to a bloodstream or nervous system." as she attends to the wound "If you experience anything out of the ordinary, physical, mental, emotional, please let me know so I can assist." The twi'lek looks to the wound, addressing the statement from the jedi that it looked to be a through and through shot, indeed it did and she didn't feel any different, save well...the hostility she had felt a few moments before "I do not feel any different but if you wish I will tell you should something of concern come up." She kept her tone fairly formal, the comment and the ghosts had all placed the woman back upon the list of caution, it would be time and a show of effort from both sides before the female was able to be trusted enough to relax again.
With the woman gone she was pleased that the Jedi had come to her asking for the medkit and now addressed it "seems I didn't get a chance to address it myself..but..would you mind looking it over? just to be safe." Visibly she relaxed in his presence, she trusted him so far at her back and the feelings going with it all were helping that trust and bond. She sighs faintly at his fingers along her skin, doing her best not to blush this time around though that was proving difficult.
"You're amassing quite the array of battle scars." A faint chuckle escapes her lips "Seems that way, it's alright, I think it's quite dashing on me." she offers him a smirk followed by the small smile that had become his.
With both woman and jedi gone to their own devices she took the time to rest and relax a bit, finishing putting the spirits back into the closet in her mind. The outbursts though had her jumping from her seat to view the scene before them; enough so in time to see the Jedi hop off and to the injured person; was that smart though? What if it were a trap. She took no chances, shifting her blaster from her holster she aims towards the body, she would watch his back to be safe.

As your group descends down the dune towards the ship you notice that the howling has stopped. Chase yells out to the lone body face down in the sand but gets no response. Now closer to the ship you can see several carbon marks all in pairs, Kasga and Deidra recognize the pattren as Tie cannon shots.
Dexter sets to work on his communicator while Kasga pulls the cart alongside the ship. Looking around the surrounding dunes create a natural barrier from any ground search, but your group would be totally exposed from the air. Kasga rechecks that data pad search grid, the crash site is well outside the imperial search area which might explain why they have not found it .... yet.
The Duro`s pilot starts up the dune to keep look out as the rest of your group decide what to do next. Chase starts to focus on the body but stops when he gets nothing in return.

### **Yogi** (2009-10-28 09:14:54)

Chase ran towards the body as the cart passed the body that was face down in the sand. From the looks of it it wasn't good. ***It's not covered in sand so it hasn't been out during the storm. Must be fairly recent that it left the ship.*** The Jedi thought as he approached. As he spoke to the body he heard someone coming up behind him. Looking over his shoulder he saw Deidra advancing with a medkit in hand. ***Better a medkit than her blaster.*** Looking back to the body as he moves it and feels for a pulse. He gets nothing. Calming himself he looked with his other sense, the Force. But the energy the encompasses all living things had left this body. Probably for the best as it eased the persons suffering. ***If we would have been quicker maybe he's still be alive.*** He removed his hand from his blaster. A clear sign to all that the body posed no threat.
Chase looked up at Deidra as she came closer with her medkit ready to administer aid. He slowly shook his head. **"It's too late Deidra. This one is already gone."** He looked back to the ship that was not far off. **"If we have the time we can take care of him properly but the cargo and survivors are the priority…not that you don't already know that."** Relaxed he stood up and looked at the blue eyed Officer in front of him not sure what to say. There was much to be said to be sure but now wasn't the time or the place for that.
He looked to the ship and nodded his head. **"Check it out with the others?"**

**In the Tatooine deep desert with outlaws watching her back. Avians of a plumage&#8230;**
As Naryen aproaches the body Chase says "It's too late Deidra. This one is already gone." She proceeds to perform a basic medical diagnostic to see if there is any chance of recovery. As she starts that Naryen responds, without looking up, with a trace of nearly cordial sarcasm **"Is that your professional medical opinion?"**.
OOC: Species? Age? If unrecoverably dead the cause and time of death. Attire? Identifying marks on garment or visible skin?
"If we have the time we can take care of him properly but the cargo and survivors are the priority...not that you don't already know that." Naryen Shrugs @ this as she works. **"Even a corpse is cargo."**
"Check it out with the others?" Naryen nods at this while she's working. **"Your skills applied to searching the ship would be an asset I agree."** there's an emphasis on "skills" that Yogi should easily interpret between them.
OOC: If the potential survivor is indeed an unrecoverable corpse then Naryen will hang her head for a moment with a sigh, as she re-evalutes the efficiency she interpreted in the group, and herself earlier, and search the body. Otherwise focussed on medical aid.
Naryen grumbles about being too damn hot & will probably take a swig of water, looking around, if this is indeed a corpse.

Tar'ja lowers her blaster at the sign from the jedi that the being was gone or no threat as shown by his own hand moving away from his blaster.
Now that the cart was close enough to the wreckage the twi'lek hops out of the cart and over to it, to begin looking for the needed cargo and any survivors "hello!" she calls out "anyone hear me in there?" she moves closer with a frown, would there be anyone else alive? what of the cargo then, would that be gone?
She frowns as she moves closer, looking for an opening with which to either call again or even enter.

Chase could hear the slight level of sarcasm in Deidra's voice as she questions his diagnosis of the body. Since her head is lowered to examine the body she didn't see the half grimace that came across his face.
**"Professional medical opinion, no of course not but I can not sense his presence within the Force.** He went on to explain weather she wanted him to or not. **"The Force encompasses and surrounds all things. All of us, even you. The beast. The sand and that ship."** He said pointed as the crashed ship with one hand while he drew in the sand with a finger form the other.
Her comment about the body being cargo was true. This was a rebel and surely had family somewhere. To give them closure would be a good thing. He nodded as he stood and asked about checking you the ship. Deidra didn't raise her head as she responded. "Your skills applied to searching the ship would be an asset I agree." Chase caught the emphasis on the word "skills"
As he turned he said one last thing. **"I know that you have an opinion of me and I can tell it's not a good one. Weather it was from the first moment you found out what I was or to the incident on the cantina. Or something completely different take your pick. I'm a man who had had just over two years of training, considerably less than you I'm guessing. I'm going to make mistakes. Just like anyone else, pilots, scouts, spies, and even officers. It's not an excuse but what I'm saying is that there are many more ways to look at something than from one angle."** His words weren't spoken with bravado or spite. They just came from they way he saw things at the moment. There was tension between them and it was causing problems. Sooner or later it needed to be resolved.
He continued his turn towards the ship where he could see Tar'ja examining the outer hull of the transport. He picked up his pace into a jog to get there quicker.

Everyone seemed to ignore Kasga's questions and set about checking the body and the ship. Kasga sprints for the ridge of the dune calling back over his shoulder, **"Double-click on the com indicates contact."**
When he reaches the top of the dune, he flops down on the sand looking toward the where the Imperial search grid is. Occasionally, he rolls over being sure to scan all directions.

As Dexter finishes programming the scrambler for the signal of his own and just be for he was ready for Chase's comm link his friend darts away to check on the body. Thinking to himself. *"Ok maybe later."* Walks into the ship looking for the the computer or nav system or something that he could figure out what was going on with this ship. "Ok. I need to find the computer treminal and I can get to work on it. Can some one point thee way please?" Dexter looks around trying to find it but he was not much of a ship hand so it was going to take a bit for him to find.

Turning over the lone body Chase`s suspicions are confirmed the individual is dead. Dressed in plain clothes the human looks battered and bruised, though it is not clear if this was a result of surviving a crash or from events after wards. The human male has an empty holster but no other possessions. After a moment of silence Deidra and Chase carry the body to the cart for transport. Chase notices the mans heavy beard, this man would have easily blended into the streets of Corellia.
Tar`ja yells out seeking survivors with only her own echo as response. Scanning over the ship most of the underside cargo hold doors are buried in the sand. From this vantage you can see that the engines are fragged beyond repair. If there is a way in it must be through one of the top side portals. Tar`ja begins up the sand dune using it as a ramp to gain access to the top side of the ship.
Kasga reaches the top of the dune and begins a full visual scan of the area. Satisfied that the local area is safe the Duros maintains his scanning, while watching over the groups progress. Even the retreating Tusken`s are beyond Kasga`s range.
Dexter climbs the sand dune opposite Tar`ja, both can see that the top hatch has been left open. The angle of the ship forces you to climb in order to reach the portal. Looking down inside the twin suns above shine enough light to see to the bottom of the ladder. At the bottom a darkened corridor is exposed but without the ships systems online you can not see more then the hatches stair well.

Dexter looks into the hatch. There was no light coming from inside which meet the ships systems had gone out in the crash. Looking over at Tar`ja. "Well my dear it appears that we have our work cut out for use. I will go in first and check it out then you can follow." Dexter takes out his glow rod, switching it on he starts to make his way inside the ship. Once he reaches the bottom he draws his blaster and starts to take a look around.

(OOC: I'll make some assumptions here, I can always edit them out later if need be.)
Naryen hangs her head a moment as she confirms Chases report that the human male is, indeed, beyond recovery. ***Another life wasted @ Imperial hands.*** She looks down at her hands. ***and other Imperial hands powerless to save him*** They clench into fists for a moment.
Unable to conclusively determine the cause or time of death Naryen let Chase speak his mind, without interuption, as he helped her move the corpse to the cart. ***Once again his prejudices about Imperials color his mind.*** With bitterness: ***I can't say they're unfounded or that I blame him in that though.*** She looks after him, as he leaves the cart and her behind and proceeds to the wreckage to back-up Dexter and Tar'ja.
Wreckage covered in damage from Imperial weapons fire.
***I guess he thought what he said didn't require a response. Perhaps he's right.***
Naryen looks to see if Kasga had anything to report. Seeing the back of his head as he steadily surveyed the area she decides things appear clear to him.
She nods to herself, at that, and sits with the cart. ***Best to stay comm silent here given the closeness of a patrol.*** She looks over the body again for any sign of concealed equipment or markings or to give another try at determining what killed this poor man.
She considers what SBC said they where here to recover ***Perhaps your callsign is 'Bacta'?***. Naryen then considers something. ***I wonder if bringing this body back will create more problems for us, at least, then letting the desert have it… or the partol***

Tar'ja climbs to the top of the ship, moving to the hatch with the other in front of her. Looking in she frowns, too dark to see much save where the suns allowed, it was going to be hotter in there then it was outside too; if there were survivors or provisions then they would have to work quickly before the heat did too much damage.
"Well my dear it appears that we have our work cut out for us." His dear? she had to give him an odd look at that one, "I will go in first and check it out then you can follow." Well he had the glow rod and seemed determined why bother trying to change his mind.
She motions with her hand for him to continue, waiting for him to clear the hatch before following. The moment her feet hit the bottom she pulls her blaster out to the ready, though she melds to the shadows for added protection "Be careful.." she mumbles to him.

Chase had spoken his mind as he helped Deidra move the body to the cart. Surprisingly she didn't have anything to say about his comments. Setting the body, that had now become cargo, down Chase looked over to the ship that Dex and Tar'ja were now looking over from the outside. He looked back at Deidra who was looking at the body. Chase took his own look at the dead man. With the beard and non-descript looks this could have been someone he walked passed the street back home on Corellia. ***I hope that this cargo is worth it. Sometimes even the loss of only one life is too much based on the outcome.*** Looking at Deidra she looked like she was content on staying with the body.
He looked back to the two at the ship and his eyes fell on Tar'ja as he watched her lithe form as she climbed up on the ship. He sighed slightly as he looked at her as the thought of getting off this dust bowl crossed his mind. Since meeting this group and Tar'ja in particular his secret of him being a Jedi has come out as well as him opening his heart to feelings that he had previously made an effort to keep in check.
The Jedi turned and walked off towards the ship leaving Deidra alone with the body. He saw the spy and scout enter the ship from the top side of the down freighter. He picked up his pace a bit just in case his help might be needed. As he did so he reached out with his Jedi senses in an attempt to sense anyone else other than his two friends in the ship.

Dexter takes the lead and climbs down the ladder his glow rod illuminating the area around him. Tarja follows after but waits on the ladder for the Bothan to clear the base of the ladder. Once at the bottom Dexters glow rod reveals a curved corridor beyond the hatch entry way. The entry way extends one meter before turning into the curved corridor that stretches in both directions. Oppsite the hath entry way is an open door leading off into the darkness of another corridor, this one straight.
The walls are dull grey durasteel panels with no decor. There is no light source anywhere to be seen except from Dexters glow rod and the few panels you see near by show no signs of power. The closest panel looks like the hatch access panel, used to open close and confirm pressure. Beside the open door in front of the opposing corridor another panel, its most likely use would be to access the door control itself.
Outside the rest of the group maintains watch. Deidra attempts to organize the cart for cargo, a short task. Chase reaches out searching his feelings and pushing them outwards towards the ship itself. Sensing no life except that of his group Chase climbs the dune and looks down the hatch.
On forward scout duty Kasga maintains a continuous survey over the area. Satisfied that the immediate area is clear the Duro`s uses the scope on his rifle to scan a further area. At first the pilot`s duty is mundane then on the horizon he spots a dust cloud moving against the wind. The cloud is moving in this direction, its moving fairly fast and seems to be stirred by ground movement. It is unclear at this distance what is causing it or how fast it is moving therefore difficult to know how long your group has before it arrives.

As Chase pushed out with his senses towards the ship he couldn't detect any other life aboard the ship other than his two friends. Sighing he quickened his pace a bit as he came to the dune that the ship was half buried in. ***No survivors it seems. I hope the cargo is intact still or this will have been for nothing.***
His booted feet clanged across the upper hull as he made his way towards the hatch. Getting down to all fours he looked down the hatch. With the bright sun it took a few seconds for his eyes to adjust to the dark interior. **"Might as well."** He said to no one in particular as he began to lower himself into the freighter. With his feet hitting the deck plating he drew his blaster and set it to stun. The darkness was a total contract to the outside sun. What light that did come down from the open hatch was quickly overcome by the darkness. Looking around he could see the retreating light from Tar'ja and Dexter. Using his Jedi senses he was able to tell which way Tar'ja had gone and headed in her direction slowly and carefully.

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his comlink. He triggers a quick double-click into the com, then carefully sets it down in the sand in front of him.

Keeping a low profile, matching Kasgas position and orientation, she comes up beside him in short oder.

Inside the ship Tar`ja and Dexter split up to cover more ground, while Chase makes his way inside the ship climbing down the ladder. Outside Kasga and Deirda examine the incoming dust cloud for possible threats.
Tar`ja continues down the corridor this part of the ship is showing signs of damage. The dura steel panels fractured and buckling on most YT-1300 transports this corridor would lead to the cockpit. It makes sense that in a fire fight this section would be a target. Tar`ja comes to a dead end, the cockpit must have been crushed in the crash as sand and rock block the way. Turning back Tar`ja is meet by Chase who had followed after.
Dexter cautiously makes his way through the interior corridor. Only a few meters away the Bothan enters a recreation room, or what use to be a recreation room. A circular game table sits broken without power on the floor in three pieces, several damaged chairs lay about torn. It looks as though the Tuskens have searched through this room. The room is large extending outside the glow rods reach, though as with many YT-1300 ships there will be a few cargo bays one should lead off the recreation room.
On the sand dune Deirda looks into the scoop with Kasga`s direction she finds the cloud. The pair take turns examining the cloud, it is too far off to be sure what it is. Going against the wind its not a storm and it is coming from the same direction the Tuskens retreated. Its possible with their method of communication they have alerted more to their aid. It will take some time before they reach your position though at least a good 20 minutes or more.
(Tar`ja and chase are in the area marked 5)

Moving away from the hatch Chase's eyes were beginning to adjust to the darkness though spots still appeared in his vision. Sensing the way Tar'ja had gone he had followed her. After only going about a half dozen meters he met up with the Twi'lek. Her glow rod illuminated the area as shadows were cast making her lilac colored skin look even darker. ***If it wasn't for that glowrod I never would have seen her with out help from the Force.*** Chase took note of her skill of hiding in the shadows. Somethign that surely could come in handy in the future.
His half smile showed though as he came up next to her though his tone was all business at the moment. **"I don't sense anyone else here in the transport other than the three of us. I hope the cargo is still intact."** He pointed with his blaster as he looked behind her. **"Nothing that way?"** He said as his gaze fell upon her face.

**In the Tatooine deep desert with outlaws watching her back. Avians of a plumage&#8230;**
Naryen takes the offered rifle. "Look there." and points it in the direction Kasga indicates. "Our Tuskan freinds may have gathered reinforcements. I doubt we'll be able to run away from them."
**"Imperial GEVs can be made to kick sand forward at low speeds, covers approach just like that."** She hands the rifle back. **"Perhaps the Tuskans have a way of hiding their approach like that too, to hide their numbers."**
Moving fairly fast towards the crash site, and seemingly stirred by ground movement, Naryen and Kasga determine an estimate of 20 minutes until it arrives.
**"I'll go tell the others to pick it up."** she shifts her wieght to slide away from the dune, while keeping her head low, when something occurs to her. **"If that is a GEV the com clicks you mentioned would penetrate even sand static. Looking at the ship they'd likely send a drone to investigate & range a missle or better."**
With a pat to Kasgas shoulder she is off to the ship hatch at her best speed. (OOC: Who had the other com again?) When she gets to the hatch Naryen will pitch her voice to carry and, sticking her head in the hatch, says **"Unknown inbound. If we aren't mobile in 10 mikes we'll be in it."** If there isn't a response within a few seconds then she just goes back to help Kasga watch the perimeter.

Tar'ja tsks as she comes to a dead end, checking it briefly before turning back, she hardly gets two feet before another form comes up and the face of the one that has been making new emotions in her appears.
Buisness this was, as so she offers him a nod instead of the smile that was his alone. "I don't sense anyone else here in the transport other than the three of us. I hope the cargo is still intact." She offers him a faint smirk "glad to know that force has some very interesting uses...I didn't know that you could use it to sense lifeforms like that.."
She hums and moves past him, 'accidentally' brushing past him "Nothing that way?" She shakes her head "We should see if we can catch up with Dexter, let him know this way is blocked."
She moves back towards the hallway and looks each way before moving towards the curved, she frowns as she hears the woman and looks back to the Jedi "We must be quick then to find this cargo."

Kasga is again surprised by Deirdra's energy and drive. She was relaxed in the cart. Why does it take a threat to make her take charge. Once she does, she does well.
As she leaves, Kasga remarks, **"Aye Sir"** and goes back to another perimeter scan.
Once she comes back, he says sheepishly, **"I was going to do com clicks to let our guys know there's a problem, but your way works as well."** After a moment, he continues, **"Even if we load fast and get on our way, they'll see our tracks and follow us. I don't think we can run from this fight. If they're Tuskans, we might be able to convince them that the rest of the ship is more valuable than the losses they will incur taking the bacta from us."**

### **Yogi** (2009-11-10 23:46:46)

He stood before her as he spoke about the three of them being alone in the ship. He saw the faint smirk come across her face. "Glad to know that force has some very interesting uses...I didn't know that you could use it to sense lifeforms like that.." He nodded at her statement. **"Well it's also how I knew you came this way and Dexter went the other."**
She began to hum as she moved passed him. Despite there being enough room in the corridor for her to go around she found a way to brush up against him. He smiled as she moved past and me managed to get a few words out. **"Nothing that way?"** He croaked as he watched her shake her head giving him her answer. Her lekku waved back and forth from the movement. "We should see if we can catch up with Dexter, let him know this way is blocked."
**"Roger that, lead the way."** As they came closer to the hatch they both heard Deidra call down. Unknowns incoming. He saw Tar'ja look back at him. "We must be quick then to find this cargo." The scout said.
As chase passed the bend closest to the hatch he yelled out to Deidra. **"Understood, ten minutes."** With a lower voice now he spoke to Tar'ja.
He kept walking past the hatch following Tar'ja. The glow rod she held in front of her provided a good light source but what it also did was silhouetted her lithe body. He remembered to just a moment ago when she brushed past him. He came up behind her and said just loud enough for her to hear. **"I think the view I have now is much better than the one you had back in the cantina."** Chase had brought up the comment she had made to him as she was covering his back. Despite the seriousness of the situation he found that he couldn't resist the chance to tease her back slightly. He wondered if the comment made her blush as the redness on her lilac skin was very flattering.
Coming to the common area he could see the light from Dex's glowrod. **"Dex we have unknowns incoming and about ten minutes to find what were looking for. Got anything?"** The serious tone had come back as Chase fought to move the thoughts about Tar'ja to the back of his mind. He looked around for anything or anywhere to go.

Tar'ja was moving a bit faster as she knew this way to be clear thanks to the other farther ahead;
"I think the view I have now is much better than the one you had back in the cantina."
The twi'lek's eyes widen at the comment a blush tinting her cheeks bright red as he passes her, oh...she was going to get back at him later.
She clears her throat and forces the blush down as best she can though when she comes up to the side of the Jedi she brushes her arm against his faintly before moving farther around the other side of the room to see if there were any other hallways.

**In the Tatooine deep desert with outlaws watching her back. Avians of a plumage&#8230;**
Naryen nods at Chases response, says **"Aff! I'm back on the perimeter with Kasga."** back into the hatch and heads back.
When she arrives Kasga speaks in a tone that Naryen hadn't heard from him before and it catches her by suprise. "I was going to do com clicks to let our guys know there's a problem, but your way works as well." Naryen gets his tone, then, and her eyes widen in suprise. ***He thinks I was being critical of him rather than his tactic!*** Motivation speeches crash through her mind one after another, rejection tossing them just as quickly. Her mouth opens a few times, but what was in mind to say left her as being inadequete before a sound could be expressed.
Her pause lets Kasga continue unanswered. "Even if we load fast and get on our way, they'll see our tracks and follow us. I don't think we can run from this fight. If they're Tuskans, we might be able to convince them that the rest of the ship is more valuable than the losses they will incur taking the bacta from us." Naryen takes the opening gratefully. **"I agree. If we are moving when they get here, and they're Tuskans, then a concentration of resistance would hopefully discourage them."** Her eyes harden as she looks around again. **"If it's Imperials then clustering will just make an easier target for aerial or artillary."**
After a brief pause of looking around again Naryen chances a response. **"Your idea wasn't a bad one but if it's detected by Imperial comspecs it may be seen as survivors trying to repair a comm."** A bitter glance at the ship and a flash of rage as she recalls the ship and pod that got her here, then **"I think the likely reponse is self evident."** Her eyes widened and her mouth fell slack as she suddenly realizes her mis-steps. Her voice becomes almost panicked and her next words tumbled out of her. **"I'm sorry, I'm sounding critical again."** She laughs nervously. **"A life of almost nothing but college and propoganda."** She shakes her head in frustration but speaks firmly. **"You deserve better than what I'm providing."**
She looks to him with visible hope then continues her watch of the surroundings.

Dexter looks around for the door that should lead him to the cargo hold that should be here. Most of the rest that he has found has been striped bare of anything useful. "Man these guy are good. I have Hutts leave more waste then this. They took everything that wasn't bolted to the deck."

Kasga is aware of the tension in Deirdra from his first statement. He tries to diffuse it by returning to the business at hand.
Kasga responds casually, **"I'll have to get you to show me how that comspec trick works if we ever get onto a real ship again. I doubt those are Imperial or we'd have already seen TIE patrols. In Bestine, they weren't frugal with them. I'm worried those are more organized criminals than Tuskans."**
He waits a moment before speaking slowly as if measuring his words, **"I don't mind critical as long as there's an order along with it. You seem to be shy on those. If you really think we deserve better, why aren't you providing better?"**

Outside Deidra moves to warn the others searching the ship while Kasga maintains watch over the surrounding area. So far the area is clear except for the incoming dust cloud. Overhead twin suns beat down on the ground mercilessly.
Inside the ship Dexter, Tar`ja and Chase continue on together. The recreation room is 7.5 meters by 7 meters. At one end cargo transfer hatches lay on the floor smashed in the ships impact, the forward cargo hold blocked by sand and rock. Empty crates lay scattered and smashed across the room and the small maintenance closet sits emptied. Another curved corridor continues on the far end of the room.[attachment=0]<!-- ia0 -->horizonbound3.JPG<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment]

Chase smiles when Tar'ja cleared her throat and then gently brushed her arm against his. He looked at her as she passed and thought he saw her blushing. Yet due to the poor light he wasn't sure.
As she walked away from him on a tangent Chase went the other way. Looking around he saw that the room had been gone over well and echoed Dex's assessment. **"The raiders went through this room well from the looks of it."** He looked at Dex who didn't answer him a minute ago. ***Lost in thought maybe hoping to find riches?*** He thought.
**"Dex we have less than 10 minutes as we have unknowns inbound."** He reminded the Spy as he turned over a crate that had been upturned.
Looking up he saw the hallway bending away at the far end of the room. **"Tar'ja over her, the hallway continues."** He waited for his friend co come over and together they could go down the hall way providing cover for each.

Shifting her glow rod in front of her she walks towards the new hall keeping her eyes open for anything that might show them where their cargo would be or any life forms though it wasn't high on her priorities with the Jedi's senses saying there wasn't anyone alive.

Dexter remains in the recreation room trying to see if he can dug through some of the rock in the forward cargo hold. Chase and Tar`ja continue on through the curved corridor coming to a L intersection. To one side the outer hatch door sits closed, before it on the floor an access panel clearly marked with a yellow checkered border. A few empty canisters and a cleaned out crate rest in this section of the corridor which ends 5 meters to a closed doorway. One of the Tuskens curved clubs sits on the floor in front of the door, its once sharp edge dulled. The door itself is close tight. Without power it could be locked or jammed, it looks as though the Tuskens tried to use the club to gain entry.
Outside Deidra waits on top of the ship while kasga maintains a watch from the near by dune. Still scanning the area the Duros sighs relieved to see the sky`s clear of Tie patrols. Checking again on the incoming dust cloud Kasga notices a smaller group running ahead of the larger group. This group is close enough to make out. The pilot can see six large Bantha`s each with two riders each closing in on your groups position. They will ahead of the main group, it is likely that they are traveling light to make up speed.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2009-11-17 10:50:41)

Chase cotinued on with Tar'ja by his side. He couldn't keep the smile off his face as he did so. Being next to her right now facing uncertainty ahead of them seem right somehow. Was it fate that brought them together or just circumstance.
He remembered a early lesson from Master Garet soon after meeting him when he was questioning the Jedi Master on why they had met and had it been lulck that they came together. Garet's grizzled voice echoed in his mind. *'Young Chase, in my experiences that is no such thing as luck. There is the Force and it can have a effect on how things happen. These things can be within your capacity to affect or not. The Force can work in strange ways but it does so for a reason.'*
He looked over his shoulder to where Dex was. The spy seemed intend on moving away the debris that blocked the forward cargo hold. shrugging he continued on and rounding the corner where he stood with the outside hatch behind him. Ahead of them down a cluttered hallway stood another door. **"Maybe we just got our break."** He said as he looked at Tar'ja with a smile splashed across his face. Advancing on the door the light from the glowrod show signs of the raiders trying to gain access to the door. Holstering his blaster he bent down to pick up the club. Looking it over quickly he saw that the sharp end was now dulled from its use in trying to force open the door. He tossed it down next to hom and it clanged off the deck plating against the wall.
**"Locked and they couldn't get in."** He looked at Tar'ja. **"With no power they might never get in or us for then matter."** He reached for his lightsaber and drew it from its hidden holster. He wished he could just carry it outright hanging from it ring on his belt but today was not that day. *Someday.* He thought to himself.
**"Good thing we have this."** He took a step back and hit the activation stud on the hilt of his lightsaber. With a *snap-hiss* the blue blade came to life and extended to its full length of 1.3 meters out before him. It's blue light cast its glow over the two of them. With a claming breath he stepped forward to the doorway, both hands on the weapon. Gently at first, and then with more strength as he got the feel for the thickness of the door, he pushed the tip of the blue blade throgh the metal. With some effort he began to move the blade around the outside of the door close to the frame. He took care to not push the blade in too far as to not damage anything on the other side. When he was about to finish the cut he took one hand off the hilt and pushed the door inward as he moved the blade through the last inch of metal letting the door fall into the cargo hold. He shut down his lightsaber and the blue glow had gone.
Heat came off the fresh cut he had made and the molten metal was already cooling. Chase held out a hand for Tar'ja indicating the new opening. **"Would you like to go first?"** He smiled and gave the Twi'lek a wink.

### **zerah** (2009-11-17 13:14:35)

Dark cramped hallway, a fight on the way, a cargo that may not even be there anymore, but all of that seemed to just slip away with the Jedi next to her. True this probably wasn't the time nor the place but she was enjoying the company of him, especially with the others away.
Something stirred in her mind as they walked, maybe she should tell him first; now seemed as good a time as any and then she could have someone on her side if things went bad with the others. She had just about made up her mind when "Maybe we just got our break."
The Twi'lek blinks, damn, so much for that thought. But a door, that was at least some development. She frowns as he holds up the club "if they couldn't get in with their clubs how....oh.." she watches him pull his light sword and ignite it. Had she ever mentioned she liked the color blue? *Oh come off it, you'd like any color if he had it for a light sword* Even her subconscious was against her.
The door falls to the floor and the blue light fades, "Would you like to go first?" She couldn't stop staring, that thing was amazing. She moves to his side and looks in, holding the glow rod out to shine some light and get a view of what was to come "It...cut through metal.." she mumbles to him "that's...quite amazing." She looks up to him and smiles slightly, glancing to the bothan that appears and nods "this way." She steps through slowly, checking around before moving any further.

**In the Tatooine deep desert with outlaws watching her back. Avians of a plumage&#8230;**
Naryen flinches at Kasgas simple inquiry.
Hard.
Her mind flashed with the last time she gave her all and felt a sense of pride and accomplishment in a command role. Saving lives and ensuring the security of galactic citizens was something she saw as her calling. Kasgas question shouldn't have fazed her. That much, on some level, she knew. What actually happened, however, was entirely out of normal proportion.
To the Wookies that ended up being the end of their lives or way of life, only they could tell who were the luckier. Their screams, she recalled, twisted into those of her homeworld. Her home. Her identity. All of this flashes through her mind in a small fraction of time, a blink really.
She suddenly looks drained of energy, life even, and her pale skin goes paler under the brim of her sun-shade. If she was standing it's quite clear she would have staggered.
She leans to one side and a somewhat shakey hand reaches for and retrieves her water-bottle. A quick swig to moisten her mouth and a tongue brushes across uncomfortably dry lips. ***Blasted heat!***
She looks to Kasga, again with the same apologetic look as before, but this time with all the appearance of someone having just endured a beating. She then looks to her pack to return her bottle saying in a confident voice totally in contrast to her appearance and body language **"I'm trying. I'm hessitant to step up too far, the fall will likely kill others. I'm sure that sounds arrogant to you but I have my reasons."** She looks back to him. **"This isn't fair to ask of you but, you're not wrong so, I need to ask it."** an equally short measure of time as she rallies herself, and perhaps draws a measure of Kasga, then: **"If I look to need support, and you agree with the direction I'm taking, a backing from you would go a long way."** She smiles a little and some life returns to her face, **"even if you don't agree, your speaking up would also help."**
She looks expectantly and hopeful again.

Dexter rounds the corner where his friends had went. Seeing that Chase has made short work of the door that was in there way. "Wow. I need to get me one of those. Make quick work of doors doesn't it." Dexter walks through the door looking around with his glow rod. " Well considering that this area was locked door there should be something here of use. Any idea what we are looking for here?"

After offering the way to Tar'ja she lcame up beside shown her light into the space that was now accessible. "It...cut through metal...that's...quite amazing." She looked up at him and smiled. He nodded at her assessment.
**The blade gives off no heat till it comes in contact with something. At that time, as you can see, it can be used to cut through practically anything. Even reinforced security doors and bulkheads if given enough time.**
Dex came around the corner just as he finished his explanation. "Hey guys. I think that way is a bust. What have you found?" The spy said in his normal jovial tone.
"This way." Tar'ja said to the Bothan as she carefully stepped through opening. As the Bothan advanced on the makeshift door he saw the Jedi's handiwork. "Wow. I need to get me one of those. Make quick work of doors doesn't it."
Chase nodded. **"Yes, doors and other things."** The Jedi stepped back to let the Dex through the doorway as the little spy continued talking. "Well considering that this area was locked door there should be something here of use. Any idea what we are looking for here?"
Sighing at the Bothan's words Chase followed him through wondering if the Bothan just winged his way though life not bothering to pay attention to the details. In his mind a spy, that didn't pay attention to the details, wasn't one due to have a prolonged life. **"Don't you remember the briefing Dex?" We're here to locate the shipment of bacta for the rebels."** Standing up he looked around the hold. The glowrods from both Tar'ja and Dex gave enough illumination for them to see.

Kasga listens with baited breath for Deirdra's response. When it comes, it seems bit staged. Sighing, he thinks back to trying to keep second Lieutenants alive. **"It's not arrogant, it's overly cautious. In case you haven't noticed, we're all wanted in our own way. Any of us will arouse suspicion for known associates."**
Looking down at the sand, he shakes his head. **"I would not have brought it up if I were not willing to follow you. It has occured to me that we may not have to deal with those,"** He gestures toward the rising dust cloud, **"if we had followed your orders when we first encountered the Tuskans. But we both know that if you need my support for your orders, you aren't in command."**

Chase pushes the light sabar into the dura steel door, the heat from the blade melts the metal away. Hot orange molten metal glows where the blade moves through it, some dripping to the floor. With a thud the door falls to the floor giving you access to the ships rear interior. Stale air and smoke assault your senses this area of the ship was tightly sealed. Dexter rounds the corner just as the door falls to the floor, with the glow from your light source you can see just inside.
Outside Kasga and Deidra continue their conversation while the incoming dust cloud draws nearer. The dewback looks refreshed and ready for travel again, its hardy fortitude to these desert conditions makes it a suitable choice for this type of terrain. From inside the ship Deidra hears a loud thump of metal on metal.
Just inside the door the corridor continues expanding to two meters wide and curving towards the engine room. Debris litter the area, fragments of metal exposed wiring this section of the ship must have sustained heavy assault. Just at the range of the glow rods several containers can be seen. Where the Tuskens might not have gained access to this area of the ship they might be undisturbed.

Chase followed the other two down the expanding corridor that lead them to the engine room. He looked around with the light provided. The room was a mess with debris and exposed wiring easily seen.
**"They really took a pounding from those Imps. I'm surprised that the ship didn't break up upon re-entry or it's crash landing."** As he spoke he ran one hand over a piece of bent wall plating. **"Too bad too this was probably a nice ship."** He gaze swept the room.
**"Hey over there."** He pointed with the hand that still held his lightsaber. He quickly walked closer to the containers and gave them a once over to see what they were and how they were secured to the ship as it didn't seem to the Jedi that they moved much from the crash.

Tar'ja somewhat in the lead with her glow rod and blaster glancing to the Jedi as he passes her for the crates. This had to be a lucky break if they managed to find the cargo with only a few minutes of looking.
She moves after the Jedi, holding her glow rod over the crates to look for the names and to aid Chase how to remove them, while holding it higher to see just what else was in the room.

I'm not in command."** she suppresses a sigh, then **"We can discuss the command structure, or utter lack, another time. Until then it's committee, back my suggestions or not, you're choice."** She looks again at the approaching hostiles. **"If we had eliminated that first group the rest would still likely have arrived looking for them."** She frowns a little as she tries to make out a change in the could but just as she is about to ask Kasga what he sees there is a sharp metallic impact from the ship that jars her.
Naryen turns, abruptly, to the ship and her puzzled look lasts for just a moment as the possibilities register. Her expression changes almost just as quickly. **"No finesse or subtly…"** She turns back to the cloud. ***Busting through barriers like a rampaging beast… or an impatient child.*** Her expression softens as she almost smiles. **"Chase must have found a door."**
She focuses on the cloud again. **"Looks, to me, that something out there has changed. What do you see?"**

Looking around inside the cargo bay, Dex sees the cargo setting there untouched all this time. "Well I guess the door was enuf to keep the Tuskens out but why would the Imperial Troops leave this out here instead of getting it themselves? I mean why not take back the med supplies for there own use? It isn't like they wouldn't have the means." Dexter lends his light to Chase and Tar'ja. He keeps watch on the door as well. "So I guess we get these out of here and head back to what passes for civilization on this planet?" Dex really wanted to get off this planet before it killed him.

Entering the recently opened section of ship Tar`ja leads with Chase and Dexter following. Along the corridor exposed wiring sparks randomly as whats left of the ships power systems pulse through them. A short distance from the doorway a small storage closet containing several crates marked Corrosion resistance extra strength and a few unlabeled barrels. Continuing down the corridor the hallway opens into the engine room but where it would continue back around the ship ends in a mess of collapsed bulkheads panels and wiring.
Inside the engine room a single service driod stands tool in hand trying to repair the hyper drive. The hyper drive looks beyond repair at this point. The droid fails to react to your presence, and as a jolt of electricity surges through its lifeless body where it connects to the hyper drive you soon see why, this droid is off line and a hazard. To the sides of the engine room the only one of the cargo holds are accessible. As with the other door it is closed shut without power Chase would have to cut his way through.
Outside the ship Deidra continues to converse with Kasga while the Duros maintains his watch. Scanning the area Kasga can see a Tie patrol in the far distance, they must have started to expand there search area.

The spark startled her, causing her to side step quickly and into the Jedi, trying to play it off as a...a...she was startled okay, she was allowed one..
Clearing her throat from the embaressment she glances up to the Jedi with a faint smile, his naturally, and continued on. "Good, there's some there. We cou-" she cuts herself off as something else catches her attention, frowning at the droid. She wasn't exactly great with mechanics so she wasn't entirely sure what to do with that thing.
She keeps her voice down to continue "We could start moving them to the others and get the cart loaded." She looks over to Chase then "You can start on that other hold there to see if there's more we can salvage while we do this. Quicker we get this done faster we get out and we're running out of time."

Kasga looks back toward the ship when he hears the thud. A flash above the horizon catches his eye. Rolling over, he uses his scope to reduce the distance toward the flash. Dropping the previous discussion, he comments, "That's trouble! TIE fighters. They must be expanding their search pattern. Your fighting retreat is looking more and more likely. Damn, I wish I had a speeder."

Dexter looks over at the droid that was more then like fired by now. "Well I guess he must have been prestant about getting this ship in the air again." Smiling Dexter walks over looking for something to push the droid out of the way so there was not danger of one of them coming in contact with it.

The three of them entered the room through the hole that he had just cut open. Chase looked around as the Bothan who always seemed to be chatting started up again.
"Well I guess the door was enuf to keep the Tuskens out but why would the Imperial Troops leave this out here instead of getting it themselves? I mean why not take back the med supplies for there own use? It isn't like they wouldn't have the means."
Chase closed his eyes for a brief second. ***Is he for real? Is he really a spy? He was at the same briefing as the rest of us were. Can't he remember anything?*** He thought as his gaze rested on the little Bothan as Dex expressed his wish to get off planet.
**"These bulkheads would have posed no problem for the Imperials. The fact that the cargo is still intact is testament that the Imps are still looking for this ship. Don't you remember the briefing?"** He did well in covering his disbelief that Dex didn't remember the briefing with SBC.
Chase walked side by side with Tar'ja down the corridor. When a panel unexpectedly sent out a shower of sparks Tar'ja side stepped quickly and bumped right into him. He looked at her to see if she was alright only to see some embarrassment in her eyes. **"I don't mind it if you bump into me. You could do that any time you feel like it."** He winked and smiled at her. He saw something grab her attention. The door that lead to the only accessible cargo hold on the ship.
Dex went to the droid and pushed it out of the way as Tar'ja came up with a action plan. "We could start moving them to the others and get the cart loaded." She turned her blue eyes towards him. In the faint illumination of the area he can barely make out the color. "You can start on that other hold there to see if there's more we can salvage while we do this. Quicker we get this done faster we get out and we're running out of time."
He nodded as he looked at the closed door. **"Right, I'll have it open quickly. Dex give her a hand if she needs it."** He said as he turned away from the Twi'lek and went to the door. Thumbing the activation stud on his lightsaber the blue blade sprang back to life and hummed as he crossed the last few feet to the door. Starting in the lower left corner he began to work his way up the door and around. He cut as close to the floor as possible to make it easier for them to carry out whatever was in the hold. Hot orange molten metal from the door added an erie glow in his area. As he made the finishing cut he placed his hand on the door and pushed it forward like the other one he had recently cut through. He stepped through the newly made doorway with his lightsaber still activated using it as his light source. While it wasn't as good as the glowrod it provided enough to get around.

**In the Tatooine deep desert with outlaws watching her back. Avians of a plumage&#8230; and the hounds draw near.**
It looked like just when Kasga was going to answer her question about the dust-cloud he draws her attention in a totally different direction.
"That's trouble! TIE fighters. They must be expanding their search pattern." ***Good eye!*** "Your fighting retreat is looking more and more likely. Damn, I wish I had a speeder."
Naryens expression is grim to match her tone. **"If we're going to deal with a TIE element I'd want a collection of portable SAMs to go with that speeder."** She looks on a bit then in a tone that doesn't imply much hope: **"One possibility in our favor is if they are relying on TIEs, for the search, that implies no orbital assets."** Her tone then returns to the grimness. **"But TIEs or a Star Destroyer if they want us dead it's a simple live fire exercise for them."**
She grins in a rather feral manner **"Quite the optimist aren't I?"** Then her expression & tone returns to that of a clinical evaluator. **"Looks like we've got some confirmed fast movers from that cloud. How long for them to get here do you figure."** There is a clear effort displayed in her word choice throughout, like she's filtering in a way she is not used to.

Tar'ja nods her head to Chase, a faint blush still on her cheeks that she was doing everything in her power to control from his words when she bumped into him. While he works on the door, the twi'lek moves to the barrels but pauses looking to her glow rod. They only needed one to get back and forth and she rather doubted that light sword could throw a lot of light.
Smirking faintly she turns and moves to the Jedi, the door had just fallen open and he had just stepped in when she appears at his side holding her glow rod out with a light smile "I think you might need this more than we will." She chuckles softly as her assessment of the light sword was correct, it wasn't throwing much light.
Passing off the glow rod, she offers a light wink to the Jedi before turning on her heel to get to work, picking up a barrel experimentally and beginning to walk back to the hatch "Come on Dex."

Working intently on the door he smiled when it fell to the floor. Luckily the metal wasn't very thick as time was not on their side.
Stepping through the "doorway" he looked around. The blue glow that came from his weapon did not light up much of the area. Silently he swore to himself. A second later Tar'ja was by his side again. A perfect smile was on her face. "I think you might need this more than we will." She said with a soft chuckle. She handed off the glow rod to him and he accepted it with his left hand. With a wink and a light stepped turn on her heal that showed off the well known graces of the female Twi'lek.
He smiled. **"Thanks for thinking of me."** He said softly so only she could hear.
Chase caught himself looking after her swaying from for longer than needed considering the time frame they were on. **"Back to work Chase."** Bringing the glowrod to bear on the cargo hold Chase took a look around as he switched off his lightsaber.

"Well ya I remember, with all there resources they should have been able to find this ship without much trouble. I mean we found it, and all we had was data pads and a cart." Dex pushes the droid out of the way and looks around the engine and at the droid its self. "I suppose i could try to see if there is anything left of our friend here. All that arcing his vibro brain is probably fried." Dex pulls out his tool pouch and kneels down to kit a closer look at the droid.

Chase looks back out into the engine room and sees Dex knelt down beside the droid with his tool pouch out.
**"Dex!"** He said with some surprise. **"The droid is of no concern right now, the cargo is. While you're looking at the droid you are making Tar'ja move the cargo by herself and we are on a time limit here. Remember the unknowns that Deidra said were inbound? There's no time for the droid. Move the cargo!"** The last bit was said with some emphasis on the word cargo.
***He's going to get us all killed. If he wants to get himself killed fine, but if he's going to put the rest of us in danger that is where I will draw the line.*** The Jedi thought to himself as he looked back into the cargo hold.

"Sorry. I just thought maybe the droid might have some useful info on it or something." He says sheepishly. "Information is life as I have been told." Dex puts away his tools and helps with the cargo. " I wonder what the others are doing?"

### **master_Tru** (2009-12-06 11:10:41)

Chase continues to cut away at the cargo door, the metal melting into a pool on the floor as Dexter talks of imperial resources. A smile crosses the humans face, he had said similar things to his master trying to understand in his early years of padawan training. The Jedi master would only ever respond to such questions with "The force works in mysterious ways, what is ment to be shall come to past. It is the way of the force, when you learn to see past your fears you will understand."
Dexter finds a length of board among the ruble in the corridor, timing his swing to the pulses of the ships failing power systems the Bothan swings. Striking the droid in the chest it falls to the floor with a thud. Dexter begins to scavenge over the droid looking for anything of use. Unfortunately the droid is beyond repair, Dexter opens a few panels on the droid to discover a full fusion of wires and circuits within.
Finishing his task with the cargo door Chase steps aside as a chuck of the door falls to the floor. As the smoke clears your group is allowed a look inside the hold, stacked from floor to ceiling crates litter the room. To one side a few smashed clear cylinders sit marked bacta. A slight green tinge covers the cargo hold floor where the precious liquid spilled out. Many of the crates are unmarked, about half are marked Corrosion resistance extra strength.
Tar`ja reaches the entry hatch with the first crate passing it up to Deidra, the desert light forcing her to squint.

Dexter looks at the cargo. "I still can't understand why the Empire would just leave this out here. Unless they didn't know what was on the ship. Thought it was just another smuggler trying to get past them running spice or something. That would explain it I guess." Dex looks at his friends. "Sorry I just don't like the loose ends. I was taught to not leave any trace of my being there. ""Be like a ghost."" Is what my intructor told me. Man also like to eat spicey foods. His breath would kill a Gundark at 50 meters." His mind keep running over and over why the Empire would leave this ship here and not try hard to find it. It didn't make since.
He moves to the door that Chase had cut open. He trys to figure out the best way to get the cargo out and back to the cart.

Tar'ja passes up the crate to the waiting arms after calling out for some help. She doesn't stay long though, somehow she had a feeling that bothan wasn't going to do what he had been told to do. She sighs and mutters under her breath before calling out "I'll be back with the next, get the cart loaded."
She leaves quickly, jogging through the corridors to cover the distance faster. She sighs as she sees yes, the bothan was doing something else other than helping her "Dex, I told you to get the crates and help me get them up to the others to load the damn cart." her lekku were twitching as she seethed with suppressed anger. She didn't like working with groups like this, the others seemed alright, Chase and Deidra for sure but the bothan she was starting to more than wonder about.
She shakes her head and kicks the wall before moving to grab another of the cargo and moving to get it to the others as quickly as she could.

**"Jackpot."** The Jedi said with a smile as he looked over the contents of the cargo hold. The Bacta that they had been tasked to find was finally in their grasp.
Quickly Chase returned to the doorway after seeing the cargo that they had been looking for. Only to hear Dexter still talking about 'Imperials and why they would leave the ship out her and not look for it'.
He listened to the Bothan talk. "I still can't understand why the Empire would just leave this out here. Unless they didn't know what was on the ship. Thought it was just another smuggler trying to get past them running spice or something. That would explain it I guess. Sorry I just don't like the loose ends. I was taught to not leave any trace of my being there. ""Be like a ghost."" He went on to talk about the bad breath if his instructor. Chase smiled remembering something that his Master had said to him once
*"The force works in mysterious ways, what is meant to be shall come to past. It is the way of the force, when you learn to see past your fears you will understand."*
**"I found the cargo. Its back here."** He said with a jerk of his thumb. **"And Dex, please try and remember the briefing. He told us the Imps WERE looking for this ship. All the resources and manpower in the galaxy wont help the Imps find something if they are looking in the wrong place. Which they are but they may not be for long which is why we need to move the cargo as fast as possible."** He saw Tar'ja come back through the first door he cut open and wasn't surprised that she let him have it the way she did.
When she finished she went for more cargo to move. He caught her attention as he put his lightsaber away. **"Tar'ja the cargo is in here and quite a bit of it. I'm not sure how were going to get it all off in time."** He looked back into the hold and the tried to think. ***Where is this cargo hold in relation to the way it crashed?*** He looked back to Tar'ja.
**"This cargo hold is free of the sand right? If it is I can cut a hole in the side of the ship while the cart is brought up along side. It would make off-loading it a lot quicker. Make sense?"**
OOC: Tru is the cargo hold the part of the ship that is free of the sand? I think it is as it kinda nose-dived into the sand if I remember right.

Entering the cramped cargo hold your light marks shadows across the crates, crates are stacked many to the ceiling and the three cylinders sit to one side smashed. The three large cylinders once containing the precious bata now cracked open by a fallen crate, the bacta spilled over the entire floor. Inside a small amount of bacta remains.
Dexter grabs another crate making his way back to the hatch when he notices a small yellow blinking light on a panel in the engine room. tar`ja quickly returns for another crate, at this point she has more then doubled Dexters progress. Outside Kasga maintains his watch relived that he has not spotted signs of advanced scouts.

Looking over the hold Chase sees the amount of Bacta that is in there. He began to wonder if they would be able to take it all. He knew the Rebels needed all they could get but they could only carry so much. Clipping the glowrod to his belt he went to the nearest crate and lifted it.
He exited the hold and took it to where Deidra was waiting, passing Dex and Tar'ja on the way. Handing the crate up to the former Imperial Chase spoke. **"I'm sure you know but the hold is packed."** He paused for a second. **"What's the situation on the inbounds?"** He said as he made his way back down.

Tar'ja forgos the hold she had been working in for the hold with the bacta, now that they knew where it was. She sighs though at the sight of it, returning to the opening in the ship to push through a crate she had picked up and calls out to the woman "Bacta's worthless. We can't salvage that mess, looks like it's just these crates."

Kasga maintains watch over the area as the cart is loaded. Your group is disappointed that the bacta and pilot could not be saved but you make due with whats left. Many of the carts contain a chemical compound resistant to corrosion while the other containers hold assorted spare parts, food stuff and some small arms (blaster pistols and clips). The droid told your group to acquire the bacta and the corrosion resistant compound anything else is extra.
Dexter investigates the small blinking light while the cart is loaded. Checking over the panel the Bothan looks to make sure it is safe to touch, cringing at the state he found the droid in. With no surges of power pulsing through the panel Dexter presses a few buttons to allow the panel to slide open. Inside a small universal motons xcelltos 1200 hyper-dive core, not very powerful this type of core is commonly used as a backup drive (x12).

Chase made use of his time moving crates from the hold to the cart. On his first trip from the back hold he looked at Deidra and Kasga as he set the crate down.
He sighed. **"Good news is that there are a Lot of these down there."** He said as he gently kicked the crate. **"Bad news is the bacta cylinders were damaged in the crash landing and leaked all over the cargo hold."**
Making a half grimace he descended back into the ship. After making several more trips the cart was beginning to fill up. Passing by the area where Dex was tinkering with something chase saw the Bothan turn around. The smile that crosses the furry little face was had to miss. "Well the back up Hyper drive is working at least. That would account for power surges possibly. Think we might be able to use this Chase? Not that we have space on the cart with all this other stuff."
Chase smiled. ***Well the snooping around the spy did finally paid off.*** He nodded his head as he walked passed. **"Hell yes it will. Don't worry about the other cargo well make room for that. With it we have a way off planet. With out it all of this cargo won't do the Rebellion any good if we can't get to them."**
Chase took a few more steps and then stopped as he looked over his shoulder. **"Good find Dex. I'm not sure if the rest of us would have found that. Bring it along so you can show the others your spoils and hurry we don't have much time left."**
The Jedi took his last crate to the hatch. The cart was just about full as he climbed out. smiling he looked at the two that had stayed topside. **"Good news…"** The other looked at him waiting. **"…but I'm going to let Dex tell you what he found."**

"Well I can take it out might take a bit." Dexter looks at the Hyper drive looking to see how long the job will take. Looking down at his tools hoping he had what he needed to do it as well. He scratches his chin. "Well here goes nothing." He begins his work.

Tar'ja had moved the last of her crates that she was willing to bring considering the bulk already in the cart and moved out of the hold to help take up the others that the Jedi brought.
Offering him a smile as he pauses "Good news but I'm going to let Dex tell you what he found." Her brow raised at this, good news? and from the bothan no less?

As everyone else is working on moving the crates, Dexter work on removing the Hyperdrive. It takes a bit but he gets it disconnected and removes it from where it was. He carefully moves it through the hallways and out of the ship to the waiting cart. "Look what I got guys. and it still works." Dexter is pleased with his prize and hopes the other will be as well.

Chase saw Tar'ja raise a lilac colored eyebrow in disbelief that Dex may have turned out to be useful. Ashamed to admit it, Chase had started to to feel the same. They had only been together a short time, perhaps Dex just needed more time to show how his abilities would prove useful for the group. He smiled when Dex came through the open hatch with his prize in hand.
"Look what I got guys. and it still works." The furry Bothan said with some enthusiam.
Looking at the others The Jedi's smile widened a but more as he looked them over. His gaze fell on Tar'ja and ge gave her a wink as the thought of getting off this backwwater planet to somewhere else was finally in reach. He pushed the thoughts of taking her out to a nice restruant to teh back of his mind as they still had a lot to do. Such as get back to Fosso's with the equipment, install the H-drive in the ship and get past the Imperial blocade that was set up around the planet.
**As we are short on time like Kasga said lets get going."** Chase looked at Kasga as he moved for the loaded cart. **"Any rifles in the cargo? I have a feeling I'm going to need somethig with a bit more range than my blaster."**

Tar'ja stares at the item in the Bothan's hands an H-drive! If it weren't for the shock that the Bothan had showed his skills she might have actually danced for show...or simply smiled.
Her gaze falls onto the Jedi letting a smirk filter through at the wink, they were finally going to get off the rock.
The Twi'lek stands offering a hand to any that needed it "Come on, lets get the hell out of here before we're in a lot of trouble."

**In the Tatooine deep desert stealing from the dead with the rest of the outlaws.**
Naryen helped load the cart but her eagerness to be useful outstepped her ability rather quickly. That the voices of the others had become muffled hadn't registered until she saw the desert floor surge towards her face like a charging bantha. She stood for a moment with one hand to her head and the other holding the side of the ship for stability.
***Stupid girl!*** Shaking her head to clear her vision she was quickly gifted with a massive preasure headache. ***An ice dweller working herself to a sweat in a desert. Xenobiology would have some quip about evolution ready.***
Missing most of the conversation she did however pick up the word "hyperdrive" and the tone of the converstation including some pride in Dexters voice. ***They're expecting Deidra. Get on it but pace yourself this time!*** She walks back to the cart with her typically deceptively confident stride.
A nod at the mention of weapons, though she didn't hear a reply.
**"Good news."** her voice strained out as she suddenly became nauseous. With a surge of focussed effort she continued **"Chase I think the corpse will be a liability back in town."** She then turns to Dexter with a smile. **"Well done getting an HDrive! We need to leave now but did you happen to get a dump from the ships computers? I hadn't thought of that earlier I'm sorry."**

Looking at Deidra as she mentioned the info dump. "Well I could try but thing are a bit of a mess down there and this was the only that seemed to be working." Looking over at Chase and the others. "What do you say give it a try or leave it? If there is anything on the ships computer it might be handy for something, never know." Dexter walks toward the cart trying to find a place to put his find down.

With the cart fully loaded your group boards the primitive craft. Slowly the low roar of thunder can be heard growing in strength. The cargo strapped down everything is set to go.
From the top of the Dune Kasgas eyes widen as he realizes the source of the thunder. Hundreds of Tuskens riding Bantha all in full charge, your location there point of rage. Kasga remembers tales told to him by his father about the Tuskens and how they travel in single file to hide their numbers, except when attacking.
Overhead the growing dust cloud loams ready to wash over the area. Thunder roars in the distance, the ground begins to shake. Looking back towards town the light of the twin suns greets your group like beacon.

Dexter sets in the cart next to the hyperdrive he found. He hears the Thunder sounds around him. "That does not sound good." he says. "There are no storms here other then the sand verity." He quites himself and thinks about his training more he had let it laps to long. He was acting like a first year trainee, freezing in combat making stupid mistakes. He was better then this, he was Spynet they got thing that other could not they did things that where the stuff of legend. He would do better.

Settling down next to Tar'ja Chase does the same and removes his blaster. The ominous sound of what was coming sounds bad even to him. "Come on! I don't like that sound of thunder and I'd rather not be here if a storm hits!...or worse!" He heard he exclaim to which ne nodded his own affirmative.
**"Yeah, that doesn't sound good. I suggest we see how fast this beast can safely go and do so now!"** He placed his free hand on Tar'ja's shoulder where he let it rest for a moment as he gave it a gentle squeeze. He lowered his voice for her he knew the others may hear despite the increasing thunder of whatever was coming but he didn't care. **"We'll get out of this and off this planet. I don't plan on dying here. Besides we just met."** He gave her a quick smile though he wasn't quite able to keep the care free tone to it like normal.

In the mind state of upcoming battle, the movement of arm before the squeeze to her shoulder had her tensing. It took a moment for her to relax, concentrated gaze and battle ready mask in place smooths faintly at the Jedi's words. "We'll get out of this and off this planet. I don't plan on dying here. Besides we just met."
She offers him his smile "agreed. I don't plan to die here if I can help it, watch yourself." The twilek glances behind her to the woman "and don't let that one get to you...you do whatever it takes to protect yourself and this cargo. We have a mission to do."
She nods to herself, shifting to ready herself to fire if need be.

He say her smile as she spoke. She relaxed just a bit in doing so. "...and don't let that one get to you...you do whatever it takes to protect yourself and this cargo. We have a mission to do." She said as she looked at Deidra and back again.
His smile dropped form his face as he spoke again. **"I know Tar'ja. As my old master said to me many times, 'Do or do not, there is no try'."** Ha gave her shoulder a light squeeze before he let go. Somehow those words seemed fitting in the moment.
Knowing that they would need their best gunners for staying off whatever was coming Chase looked at Deidra and Dexter. **"One of you needs to get this slow going cart moving now! And as fast as we can manage. Lets go!"** He looked over the crates of ordinance and whatever else the Rebels were trying to smuggle. **"Who among us had the most demolitions experience? Maybe we can jury-rig up some explosives just in case we need it."** Blaster drawn he hunkered down next to Tar'ja.

**In the Tatooine deep desert stealing from the dead with the rest of the outlaws.**
Naryen finds herself swept up in the motions, as she works to get the cart loaded and mobile, and as such misses interactions all around her that seem to blur together into a jumbled mess.
Given how she feels she's not even sure if she just thought about mentioning the corpse to Chase or if it actually happened.
That changed when the tension level jumped around and in her. Up until that moment she was staring, unseeing, at the face of the corpse that they had loaded onto the cart. Images of corpses most with eyes open, freshly killed by Imperial troops. Some were faces she knew.
She turned to see the still growing cloud from the approaching raiders but now she could feel the tremors from their approach.
She started to speak but her dry mouth and throat didn't cooperate. When she tried again her voice came through, though not strongly. **"Though I'd rather not draw any more attention from the patrols…"** She paused to collect her thoughts, then she heard Chase mentioned explosives. **"… we should see what we can rig after we are mobile."**
She eyes the corpse again then climbs into the cart and secures the HDrive as best she can.
**"Chase, I'm thinking now we need to leave the body."** she gestures to the dead rebel **"Help me unload him then lets go."** Naryen looks pale, even for her, around her eyes.

With the ever increasing thunder approaching, seemingly faster as each moment slips by, Kasga mentions a firing position being better for him. Tar'ja is already hunkered down ready for a fight. Dexter just sits next to the HDrive that is still unsecured to the cart as Deirda seemingly in thought talks about the explosives suggestion only to go and secure the prize HDrive to the cart that should have already been taken care of.
Inwardly Chase sighs as Dex just sits there again. The spy must not have heard the need to get moving and his request for him oe Deidra to take the reins of the beast to get them moving.
"Chase, I'm thinking now we need to leave the body." She motioned to the dead rebel. "Help me unload him then lets go." The look in her eyes seems sunken which only seems to amplify the paleness that is accompanied on her already white skin.
**"Agreed it will draw to many questions."** He said as he moved to her. Looking at Dex he raised his voice. **"Dex! That leaves you to drive us. Move it now or we will probably die here!"** He helped the former Imperial officer roll the body off the cart hoping that in that time Dex would have moved to get the beast moving.

As your cart progresses the thunder gets louder and louder. Overhead the sky is clear, the suns beat mercilessly down on the sands only a slight breeze wisps across the sands. One last look back at the crashed ship you make your way back to town and away from these cursed sands.
As Dexter takes the reins Deidra and Chase push the pilots body over. With an unceremonious thud it hits the sand, sand that is now moving. You can now feel the thunder as it draws nearer. Vibrations run through the cart and into your bodies, the sand around you shakes and falls. This is an unusual storm, Chases closes his eyes for a moment reaching outward the storm itself is angry.
Dexter pulls the cart to the top of the dune, which is also shaking slightly with the thunder. In the distance a dark cloud draws near. The cloud rest close to the ground and has been created by the dust of hundreds of Bantha`s. Behind you a small army of Tuskens riding their beasts of war charge in on your position. You can now hear there horrible war cry's as they shake their weapons in malice.
The path back to town looks bright and clear, with little options the Bothan pushes the Dewback forward and towards town. It takes very little effort to bring the mount to full speed. For now your cart is managing a comfortable distance from the Tusken war party. Provided the Dewback holds out you should reach the protection of town before they reach your position.
Each of you look to each other in your time of need, none of you had ever dreamed you would be in such a dangerous predicament. With knowing glances you all realize you need each other more then ever before, it will take each of you and more to get out of this alive.

### **Yogi** (2010-01-04 12:59:20)

Chase feels the cart begin to move as he helps Deidra push the rebel body off the cart. The thud it makes when it impacts the sand resonates within the Jedi. ***At some point in out lives we'll all be like this one here. I just hope my end will not be like this one's*** he thought as he closed his eyes for a moment.
Instinctively he reached out with his Force senses. The storm was unusual. It was almost as if the storm itself was angry and the only thing that it could unleash its ferocity upon was the five of them. It was quite unsettling.
**"You may not believe me…"** He said turning and looking down at the shorter woman. **"…But what's approaching is very angry."**
Cresting the dune he ahead and saw the town off in the distance. A beacon of relative safety it was, more safety than what was behind them at least.
Despite the war cries that could be heard and the fast movement of their own beast and cart Chase found himself looking at the others. They needed each other. Even if they didn't realize it yet. He knew back in the cafe that the Force had brought them together for a reason. As his gaze fell upon the beautiful Twi'lek that he had become more than friends, back at the Jawa camp, he realized something that had been missing in his life for a while now. A smile broke across his face
Friendship and companionship. Not just from Tar'ja who his feelings were growing for but from the others as well. Friends that would look out for each other even with a army of desert people bearing down on them.
He looked back at Kasga coming out of his realization. **"Kasga any explosive experience? Maybe we can rig up something from these crates to give them a bit of a surprise if they get close?"**

Dexter looks at the sea of bantha running at them each with an angry tusken setting on top. He tries to make the beast move faster. "If I didn't know any better I would swear the galaxy has it in for us. If we get off this rock in one piece it will be a miracle ." he was feeling fear but the flight part of it was kicking in and he was not stopping the cart for anything.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2010-01-04 17:45:42)

Once Dexter took the reins, Kasga took a firing position at the rear facing the horde. At the mention of explosives, he looks at the crates and considers it's contents. **"I've had explosives training. But I don't think we have components that would explode. Maybe I'm wrong…"**
Kasga starts looking at the crate labels to see if they're usable for explosive devices.

With blaster in hand and in the best position she could find that would allow her to fire if need be she glances around as she feels eyes land on her.

**In the Tatooine deep desert stealing from the dead with the rest of the outlaws.**
Naryen watches the corpse drop to the sand, discarded like so much waste. She feels the sickness from the heat jumble with the sickness in her gut from having any hand in disrepsecting the remains of someone brought to an end through Imperial actions. The former Imperial begins to shake slightly as she sits, arms wrapped around her legs, staring into the cloud chasing them. She tries, and fails, to use the cloud to distract her from how dirty her hands feel.
After a moment she turns to Kasga. **"Do we have another rifle so someone can back you up?"** Her voice, though strong, cracks noticably and she takes a drink from her canteen. Putting the canteen away she draws her pistol and positions herself to offer what aid she can in harrying their pursuers.

Still on the run Dexter maneuvers the cart over a dune, these speeds the repulsors struggle to keep up with the shifting dunes. From dune to dune the bottom of the cart hits knocking the passengers inside a little. The cargo is strapped in tightly and only shakes a slightly at the jolts.
Kasga and Chase begin to look over the cargo for anything of use. Most of the containers are labeled corrosive resistant epoxy a few spare parts containers and finally one with weapons inside. Cracking open the wooden box you find its full of blaster pistols and power packs. Twenty Blast-tech mark 5 blaster pistols with forty power backs. The few cylinders labeled spare parts contain random droid parts all just thrown inside and sealed.
Dexter manages to maintain a consistent distance from the bantha horde, though this does not stop them from firing in your direction. At this range their slug throwers fall short harmlessly hitting sand dunes behind your position. When the horde reaches the crash site a few stay behind while many many more continue the chase. On the winds Tar`ja hears a buzzing noise, it reminds her of the various insects she has seen in her travels. The sound is short lived in the confusion.

Eyes narrow as pale blue turns to the sky and sand around them through the opening of the cover; insects? where were they? A frown turns at her lips, it was nothing...her imagination perhaps...
then again...
"Did anyone hear buzzing? like insects.." she calls to the others. She knew she heard something, even if it was her imagination the tiniest thing in their chase could get them killed if not warned, perhaps someone else would be able to place the sound

Chase helpd Kasga pour over the crates. All they found were blaster pistols and power packs along with some droid parts. It wasn't much but the Jedi hoped that Kasga would have an idea on how to rig something.
The good thing was that they didn't need that something right away. Dex was doing a good job of keeping distance from the oncoming hoard. Far enough away they were that their shots fell short.
he heard Tar'ja speak up next to him. "Did anyone hear buzzing? like insects.." Chase looked around and on the cart for anything that could cause a buzzing sound.

**In the Tatooine deep desert running from a stampede that uses guns&#8230;**
Naryen, after rubbing her hands on her thighs, takes the rifle from Kasga. The weapon in her hand looks foreign, alien, to her, for an instant, then she shifts her grip to something far more familiar.
Tar'ja then gets her attention with a mention of a buzzing sound. She listens but all she hears is Chase as he responds. Naryen looks to Tar'ja & shakes her head to indicate she didn't hear anything, then looks back to the raiders still chasing them.
Her expression starts to harden as she considers actions/choices.
"Sir, I can set these off whenever, but I could blow us all up too. Simplest is to wait until they get too close." she turns to Kasga at this. **"Go with what you are most confident. We'll work with whatever it is."**
After some pause she voices her thoughts. **"The best I could do with this is empty the cell into them. If anyone has any better ideas I'm open to them. I'm concerned that they will draw the attention of the troopers in town, to us, when we get there."** Her expression goes harder with a tone of disaproval as she continues **"If I could cause some of them to stumble into the group, it would slow their advance and they may give up on us."**
She looks to each of the others, in turn, with an expression of appeal, then back to their pursuers. **"There's been too much death."** the expression was quieter and more for herself but everyone should be able to hear her.
This provides an insight. **"We don't have the supplies for this, but I'd rather leave a swath of duds in our wake, then shoot the only live drop for a brilliant display. Then they won't know where to go and would just stop faced with a veritable minefield. Unless they are suicidal."**
She shrugs then **"Dreams."**

Dexter continues to push the Dewbak which is more then willing to flee the oncoming horde of Bantha and Tusken raiders. The beast grunts loudly as it pulls hard on the cart dragging it over the next dune then on to the next. The Bothan begins to pant as his efforts start to show, both are working hard to maintain the momentum and distance from the masses.
Tar`ja tilts her head trying to pick up the buzzing sound again if not only to prove to herself that she did not imagine it. The Twi`lek knows all too well the dangers waste lands posses and what it can do to ones mind. Disappointed Tar`ja hears little beyond the carts clanking cargo.
Chase to listens for the sound with both ears and feelings. The human closes his eyes reaching outwards across the sands. The confusion of the massed horde is somewhat distracting but Chase continues to reach out across the dunes sensing shadows. Surounding the cart in all directions shadows race between the dunes looking to strike. Chase senses five such shadows one to each side two behind and one ahead of the cart.
Pulling out a few power packs Kasga notices they all have a full charge, so he holds on to three of them. The overall condition on the power packs indicates they are all used. More then likely the entire containers contents are used. Who would be transporting used weapons, Bacta and acid resistant compound? Kasga thinks to himself just as he then hear a slight buzzing sound, unfortunately he is unable to determine direction.
Rifle in hand Deidra begins to scan for targets, while listening for this buzzing noise. The human woman does hear the buzzing sound, though its more like several. Quickly the ex imperial begins to scan the area for the new threat using the rifles scope in areas where distance is a factor.

As he reached out with his senses Chase closed his eyes. Looking deep within himself he drew upon the power of the Force with the intent to see what wasn't there. With the force he could sense out farther than the eyes or ears could see and hear.
When he reached the horde he took a knee to settle himself. The anger and bloodlust was almost overpowering from the Sand People. Pushing out farther he was able to pass them.
It was then that he sensed something. It was almost as if it wasn't there. Like it, no they were hiding in the shadows of the dunes. He opened his eyes but the twin suns were still beating down on them. his eyes closed again.
Reaching out in all directions he sensed the others 5 in total, waiting to strike. His hand reached out to Tar'ja's shoulder. ***Strike who!*** Chase thought.
Turning around quickly Chase opened up his eyes and looked in the direction they were traveling. Trying to see with his eyes what the Force told him was there.
**"There's something out there other than what's chasing us!"** He said excitedly and loud enough for all to hear. His heart was pounding and he was doing all he could to control his emotions. **"It's at all four points. Their intent isn't friendly."**
***But who is their intent for? Us or the ones following us? Or are we one in the same? Or maybe…*** The Jedi thought a he quickly shut down his presence in the
Force as best as he could while trying to calm himself. ***Maybe I'm leading them to us.*** He wasn't having much luck.

"Something is surrounding us?" she looks out to the sand and sun frowning "there's nothing there...is it.." she looks sharply to the others "is it in the sand? what hides in the sand?"
What...what hides in sand on this planet? she wondered to herself, racking her brain for something...anything...what hides in sand??
She looks to it now as well, hoping the visual of the desert will help her mind and perhaps even show a glimpse of this buzzing hidden creature.

The effect on Naryen was visceral as trained responses nudged her senses into clarity & function. Everything sharpened as her awareness heightened with a flush of adrenaline. ***From the lava flow into the volcano? I don't like hungry swarms!*****"Anyone know what we're hearing?"**
She nods to Kasga. **"I agree, drawing fire it's a good move right now."**
As Naryen looks around the cart, with divided attention on the horde and the surrounding area, something occurs to her.
**"Chase, do you get the impression that what is surrounding us is guarding our retreat?"**

Your group continues to push forward as the Tusken war party gives chase. From time to time on of the Tusken gunners gets a close shot, its slug bullet impacting into the dunes spraying sand around. Kasga readies the power packs he had scavenged from the cargo, this will allow the Duro`s to quickly assemble a make shift bomb if need be. Eyes on the Horde the ex imperial officer readies Kasga`s rifle scanning the area for anything that gets too close.
As the group now splits their focus on escaping the horde and listening for this mysterious buzzing two tan speeder bikes burst out from a side dune. The riders wear layers of tan cloth intermingled with strands of black leather, protective ear for the desert elements but their tri-goggles give the race away, Gran.
The bikes look worn but well suited for the desert terrain. Each Gran holds a pistol in hand, and as they blast from the dune they both take shots at Dexter. The first shot goes wide passing well in front of the Bothan, while the second slams into the dura steel cart frame.
As the Gran take the shot they use their speeders rapid acceleration to their advantage. Screaming in front of the cart they move to the opposite side looking to the dunes for cover. As the bikes scream past your group hears the modified repulsor dune engines buzz as they produce power to the vehicle.
(INT Kasga 26, Naryen 20, Gran 18, Tar`ja 17, Chase 15, Dexter 10

Chase crouched looking around the menacing feeling from the Force still hung over him like a cloud. The presences were out there but he didn't now what they were.
He heard Deidra's question and looked at the woman. "Chase, do you get the impression that what is surrounding us is guarding our retreat?"
Shaking his head he gave her a answer. **"Guarding our retreat no. the presence I sense is menacing and it seems to be directed at us in particular. As to what it is I have no idea other than that it seems to be five of them."** He continued to look around unsure if what he had just said was right or not.
The buzzing got louder as chase looked to the side two speeders broke through the sand. Despite the layers of tan cloth and protective gear the tri-goggles were a dead giveaway. **"It's the Gran bounty hunters!"** Chase yells out to the others as the speeder bikes whine as they escape sands that hid them seconds before. the two took shots at Dex, both going wide, one not so much. The curses from the Bothan let Chase know that the spy was still alright.
**"We're in it now."** He said to no one in particular as training took over and he lined up one of the speeder riders and fired his blaster.

Tar'ja's eyes were wide as the hunters came from the dunes themselves, at least she knew she wasn't going crazy, though at this point she might take that over this situation.
Moving back inside the cart the twi'lek woman moves to take a seat up by the Bothan, removing her blaster and getting ready. If they were going to shoot at him to get the dewback to stop then she was going to take this opportunity they would give and shoot right back.
Setting the blaster to her sights she waits, she had watched them go in front and to the dunes, she could only aim at one at a time but she would do so carefully, aiming well for them to come back into her sights before firing.

The universe, it seems, is not without it's sense of humour. Albeit a dark, twisted, mean tempered & maniacally malicious sense of humour, but humour nonetheless.
This is the sentiment that flutters through Naryens mind as flying bikes launch from behind dunes around them piloted by three eyed creatures that then fire upon their driver. Given what would happen if they stop, or rather what would be done to them by the pursuing raiders, the Grans intent is clear.
***Shards!***
When Kasga says "Sir..." The rifle is already on it's way to being held in front of him as Naryen draws her pistol and then she really takes a risk.
**"Chase, I don't suppose you've been trained how to use that energy sword to keep our humerous friend Dexter from getting shot?"** The skin on her neck crawls as she thinks of Chase cutting her down as he deflects weapons fire.

Dex continues driving the bantha as fast as they will go. Out of the corner of his eye he see Chase move up next to him. "Sorry don't have time to chew the fat as it where trying not to get shot." Dex looks at the Grans on there speeder bikes. "You know I am sorry about this. It is kind of my fault for ticking off that crime boss. If it helps I took him off a lot of credits which I spent on the woman that turned my into him. I guess I had it coming." Dexter smiles it was fun while it lasted.

The Grans bike buzz past your cart and off toward the dunes to the opposite side. Tar`ja holds her blaster steady taking in a breath before squeezing off a shoot. The Gran hurls forward as the shoot impacts him in back before sliding off the still moving speeder bike. The bike races into a nearby dune exploding on impact as it streams off out of control, its rider lying motionless on the desert floor.
Chase draws his lightsaber activating the blades blue energy to its full length. With his blaster in the other hand the fledgling jedi lets a shoot go at the remaining Gran. The shot goes wide impacting into the desert sands.
Dexter continues to push the Dewback forward up another dune and down the other side. Behind in the distance the Tuskens continue their pursuit while all around the buzz sound of the Gran bikes echoes.
Kasga reaches out for his rifle just as Diedra passes it over. Aiming his shoot to take out the remaining threat the Duros lets off a shoot. Deidra motions with one hand indicating the remaining Gran as the most intimidate danger "Fire fire! Take him out before he hits Dexter giving the Tuskens a chance to catch up." Kasga`s shoot wings the Grans shoulder almost knocking the bounter hunter off course.
As the remaining Gran finishes his retreat through the dunes to the left side another two speeders race out from the left side. Two more Gran ride into the fray firing shoots as they go. The first Gran fires then blasts in front of the cart heading for the rght side. These two are obviously heading for the dunes using them for cover. The Grans shoot goes wide over head. The second Gran follows in firing on Dexter, the shoot forces the Bothan driver to crouch down narrowly avoiding the blast. The effort winds Dexter as the rush of adrenalin keep the Bothan`s thoughts focused.

Tar'ja let no emotion filter into her as the gran falls to the ground, two more had come forward and she was ready
"Chase hit one, I don't care which just either shoot it or focus on protecting Dex, don't try to do both." She calls over to him, having the mind decided in this was not going to help them. She aims carefully at the closest Gran, waiting for the right moment before firing off a shot.

Chase watched as his shot went wide followed by Tar'ja's advice of doing one or the other. With one down in a fiery explosion and the other that was hit now moving over a dune two more speeders came from the left. It came down to reaction now he knew that he had to score a hit on these guys or Dex was going to get shot. ***Then we's really be in a bind.*** He thought.
He was better at shooting than deflecting no doubt about it. Keeping the saber active he aimed at one of the two gran that came from the left. Steadying his breathing he fired. The red lance of energy escaped the muzzle of his blaster in the direction of the Gran.

Tar`ja takes in a breath lining up a Gran rider as he makes for the cover of the dunes. Releasing her shoot the Twi`lek curses as the blast impacts harmlessly into the sands.
Chase now standing follows Tar`ja`s target trying to line up a shoot of his own. The bikers are running their engines hard making it difficult to maintain a target. The human fires but also misses his target, the blast goes wide and off into the sky.
Dexter now fearing for his life pushes the cart forward even more. No one needs to tell the Bothan how to hijack a moving cart, shoot the driver and he is the driver!
Deidra and Kasga pause as the twin riders move off into the dunes for cover. The Gran maneuver between the dunes to the left where the first had disappeared.
Another buzz indicates the power of a speeder on its way. The first returns from the left side of the cart. Immediately Deidra opens fire, letting several shoots go around the target. Though her intent was not to hit the Gran Deidra smiles as she sees the Gran off balance.
The Gran try`s to return fire while ducking further into the bike. The shoot impacts into the cart, obviously intended for Dexter.
Kasga holding ready takes a shoot of his own. With the Grans low profile there is only one target. The blast hits the Gran in the head forcing him back and off the speeder. The bike itself dips its forward prow digging into the sands. In a spin of metal and fire the bike explodes in front of the cart rolling off to the right.
Up a head another Gran can be seen watching the skirmish from a far. Over a loud speaker you hear him order "Forget them kill the beast, let the Tusken`s at them!" His voice is cold but familiar, he was the leader of the Gran at the cantina.

Tar'ja swears colorfully half under her breath and half not. Where she learned such a colorful vocabulary was no doubt part of the things of her past she hadn't told anyone.
Her head perks faintly, lekku twitching "That leader's giving the orders, somebody shoot him if you see him that may give us enough time to take out the others if they're distracted!"
Looking up to the Jedi beside her she offers a few words "Don't get shot, and aim for the bike if you have to." She looks over to the Bothan next "keep driving, stay as low as you can."
She levels her blaster for the next shot, waiting for the next unlucky Gran to drive by.

His shot went wide as well as the others except Kasga. With some support from Deidra they were able to tag another and send him to a fiery death.
Both Tar'ja and Deirda had advice for him. 'shoot the leader'.
**"He's too far away we would all need rifles."** He needed to cover the beast if they were going to start shooting at it. If it became injured or killed they were done for from the advancing horde behind them. Holstering his blaster then switching his lightsaber to his right hand he looked to the beast that was in front of the cart.
**"I've got to be crazy!"** The Jedi said out loud as he walked up next to Dexter. Taking a second in an attempt to calm himself he reached out and felt the Force all around him. He sensed it between him, his friends, the beast, the sand, even the Gran and their speeder bikes. The Force was most defiantly his ally. Though despite the feeling he still wasn't calm as he was about to jump/run on to the beasts back.
OOC:
Holstering his blaster and moving onto the beasts back. where he would ride it like a horse and holding to whatever classifies as a harness for the dewback with one hand. Will attempt to deflect shots at the beast/himself at +4 (UtF +9 -5) Full defensive also...thanks Reb.

Tar`ja takes aim at the fleeing Gran lining up another shoot. Following their escape she squeezes the trigger, her shoot misses hitting the side of a sand dune as the Gran take cover.
The young jedi summons all his will as he sizes up the Dewbacks movement. Noticing a rhythmic pattern to the beasts charge Chase leaps forward. Shocked everyone watches the human as if in slow motion, in mid air the jedi leaves the safety of the cart. With a sigh of relief Chase lands in the back of the mount but now finds himself force to hold on to the straps to maintain his position. Finally secure the human rides the beast with on hand holding fast, in the other a brilliant glowing sword ready to fend off attacks.
Dexter pushes the beast on, now a little concerned for Chase. The Bothan wonders and hopes that the human can hold on but realizes he must keep the cart moving or he and all his friends are bantha chow.
The two remaining Gran burst back onto the scene blasters blazing. Kasga responds with fire of his own, while Diera shouts out words of wisdom aiding the Duro`s shoot.
The first of the Grans shoots falls short hitting the sands between the beasts legs, the second hones in to the animal itself but is deflected at the last second by Chases lightsaber.
Kasga lets lose a shoot of his own tagging the lead Gran. The Gran is forced back but the impact of the blast but holds on as he races for the other side and towards the dunes for cover.
Tar`ja takes this opportunity to finish off the injured Gran. Following his now slowed movements she fires, hitting the Gran in the back the would be bounty hunter slumps in the seat the bike slowing to a hover.
Chase now confident on the beast takes a more defensive pose allowing him to better coverage of the beasts exposed sides.

*WHAM!*
His body impacted with the beasts back. Massive muscles from the dewback moved in a synced rhythm underneath him as the Jedi sought a hand hold. It was a harrowing few seconds but relief settled in as his hand found purchase and he became steadied on the beasts back. He looked side to side for the Gran. Watching and waiting remembering the remote training with Master Garet.
-----
**"You mean I can stop a blaster bolt with my lightsaber. It's not just a holovid trick?** Chase asked as he rotated his right wrist and the humming noise from his blade increased in volume.
Garet smiled. **"Yes young padawan it can be done. And with practice you can too. When you are open to the ebb and flow of the Force even a blaster bolt can be deflected or even redirected back at the attcker."** Garet raised his hand and activated the training remote. It began to hover in place as the hand was removed.
**"Begin young Chase"** The Master instructed. Raising his blade the remote began to move around. Watching it carefully Chase did. *Zap*.
**"Ouch. Hey that actually hurt a bit."** He said surprisingly rubbing his upper arm.
Smiling Garet rebutted. **"If it didn't young Chase, learn you would not."**
*ZAP!*
**"Karking hell!"**

The gran came back over the dune that was up ahead. The first one to shoot wasn't lined up well and the shot fell short. The second one though seemed more focused. As he fired Chase could almost see the blaster bolt moving in slow motion. His arm moved on instinct or the Force he wasn't sure but the down ward slash to cover the beasts body intercepted the shot and the red lance of energy impacted into the sand away from the beast.
Settled in now the Jedi looks for the other rider and the leader. They weren't out of this yet. He still wanted to get off this rock. And if he could do that with them especially Tar'ja all the better. Pushing those distracting thought back he concentrated on the hear and now. His light saber burned its bright blue light waiting to fend off other attacks.

Tar'ja's first shot went wide, she bares her teeth more at herself than anyone else in annoyance, damned Grans. A distracting movement beside her caught her attention, watching in semi-horror as the Jedi jumps in slow motion to the dewback; please...please make it.. she pleads inwardly, holding her breath until the male makes it to the dewback.
Thank the stars... she breathes deeply and watches him deflect a shot, a Gran was slowing from a hit from the duros behind her and she took that opportunity to finish him off.
Now though...hmm...that bike might prove useful... "Dex...can you move a bit closer to that bike, I think we could use it." She looks over to the Bothan "just enough for me to jump out for it."

"Closer! If you have notice Tar'ja they are try to kill me here, and you won't me to get closer to them?" Dexter was kind of just trying to get in the general direction of away from Gran bounty hunters. Getting closer to them was not something he wanted to do. "This seems like a bad idea but I will try." Dexter tries to get the bantha to move closer to one of the speeder bikes. Maybe he would get lucky and run one down, but that was unlikely.

"The Gran on that bike is dead." the twi'lek says to the bothan "but that bike might be useful." She prepares herself to jump to it from the cart to the bike, landing on the sand would be fine with her so long as she got that bike. She pauses and looks behind her "I'm going to try to get the bike, unless someone has more practice with them."

Kasga is focused on his target. He's moving too wildly for him to line up a clean shot. He did burn him a little, but not enough for the Gran to break off the attack. We have got to stop them before they kill the dewback and doom us to the Tuskans. At least the Gran leader over there is not firing yet. Focus on the immediate threat.
Kasga's fearful thought is jerked out of his head as Chase leaps over him and onto the back of the dewback. **"Karking hell. What happened to focused fire? He's going to get himself thrown off and we can't get back to him."**
Kasga hears Tar'ja say she can handle the speeder. At least someone could go back and pick him up.
Kasga yells, **"Do it! Do it fast. I'll try and cover you."**
He trains his blaster rifle on the side of the dune where the last Gran on a bike took cover. He looks for the guidance forks to appear to give him guidance to his target's body.

**In the Tatooine deep desert running from a stampede that uses guns while being shot at from flying Harleys. Wow.**
Naryen, still moving with Kasga as much as she can, recalls what was covered with General Order-66 about how to kill Jedis. A very clinical exploration of their abilities and how to circumvent them. In particular the mention that they can deflect blaster fire with their energy blades.
She responds to Kasgas frustration with a **"With you! Chase is covering our beast." *I hope!*** and maintains the same posture with him, crouched fashion etc. as images of Chase losing his balance and rending their cart-puller in half flash through her mind in vivid detail. Her sense of fear thrashes at her trained responses as the seconds stretch on.
She finds herself scowling at the choice to get the bike and is further suprised by Kasgas reaction. ***Why must things keep getting debated in a commitee?*** Naryen finds herself, again with considerable bitterness and mixed feelings, missing the structure of a military heirarchy. ***If she gets into trouble she'll be alone.*** She thinks about some of the decisions she's seen made during her tours. Lives sacrificed, to her, without a reason evident to her at the time.
Later it occurred to her that the reasons to let so many good citizens die may have been politcal and it infurated her. This, combined with her feelings towards Chases actions and their brief history, caused something unexpected to happen.
Suddenly her face and her tone were an sharp contrast to her coordinated and smooth movements with Kasga. Her voice cracked and her tone was something that sounded close to panic at the thought of Tar'ja being flled by enemy fire. **"Tar'ja, you'll be on your own out there!"** Immediately her sunburned face flushed showing her embarassment, a conflict with her training and experience. **"We'll cover you if you go."** Her voice is stronger but the tension is evident to her own ears causing her to blushes deeper.
A hollow feeling sits in her gut. ***Please don't!***

We'll have more range of fire and be able to clear the way." she calls back, then looks to the duros "Try to get a second, two would be better than one!"

Chase hangs on to the beast of burden, sword in hand then human intends to defend the animal, thus keeping the group alive. Almost as if sensing the young jedi`s intentions the dewback relaxes to Chases new position. Dexter slows the cart before passing the speeder bike. Giving Tar`ja just enough time to jump off before starting up again. In the back ground angry Tuskens continue their pursuit wooing and howling war cry`s.
Kasga steadies his rifle lining up a shoot for where the Gran should burst through. Deidra continues to direct the actions on the cart, but notices the Gran in the distance speed away. The coward blasts his speeder bike in the direction of town without even a thought for his remaining comrade.
To the right side of the cart a buzzing can be heard again. The whine of the Gran`s speeder bike pitches to full speed, except this time the Gran does not charge instead retreating in the direction of town after his fleeing leader.
With the Gran threat in retreat Tar`ja jumps down and rushes to the bike. Quickly checking it over the speeder is in good working order. The Twil`ik woman takes the bike using it to catch up to the fleeing Bothan before he and the cart move out of sight.

After letting Tar'ja off Dexter gets the cart moving again. He didn't really want to stop or even slow down to let her off but if it helped the rest of the them out it couldn't hurt. "I hope we make it to town before those Tuskens catch up. That could make things interesting." Dexter looks around at his friends. "So how we doing?" he asks.

Tar'ja looks over the bike quickly, good, it was still good to use. glancing back to the tuskens she hops onto the bike and punches it into gear to catch up, moving up beside the cart so that she could keep watch. Now that both Grans had moved off to town it might be easier to out run the group behind them, might. She glances over to the Jedi for a second "You alright up there Chase!" she calls to him.

### **Yogi** (2010-02-24 01:06:17)

Riding the beast legs and hand holding on for dear life Chase held his lightsaber out to his side ready to deflect any attacks from the Gran. The beast seems to understand what was going on and Chase could feel the muscles on the beasts back relax. ***Maybe this was a good idea after all.*** The young Jedi thought to himself as behind him the others spoke of a plan. Tar'ja was going for the speeder that they were going to be passing.
When the time came he looked over his shoulder and saw the lithe, lilac skinned beauty jump down and run for the bike. ***Be quick Tar'ja, be quick.*** A smile appeared when she hoped on the speeder bike and took off on it. Confirming the situation he began to look for the Gran that had retreated again. **"Retreat seems to be becoming a habit for them."**
"I hope we make it to town before those Tuskens catch up. That could make things interesting. So how we doing?" He heard Dex behind him shout out.
**"As long as we keep pace we should be alright."** He yelled back as Tar'ja came up along side.
"You alright up there Chase!" Looking over to his friend on the speeder bike he saw her smile which he happily returned as he shut down his light saber and attached it to the ring on his belt where he would normally openly carry it. This way it was easier to grab it if it was needed. He would just have or remember to relocate it to its concealed spot before town.
**"I'm doing just fine but I should probably relocate off of our friend here."** He said as he patted the strong muscular side of the dewback as he reached out with the Force to the animal reassuring it that he meant it no harm. He smiled again. his actions had worked. The animal and his friends were safe for the moment as long as they stayed ahead of the horde behind them.

With the Gran threat in active retreat, Kasga whips over his rifle over toward the Tuskan hordes still chasing them. He checks the distance again hoping they haven't gained on the fleeing dewback.

**In the Tatooine deep desert running from a stampede that uses guns while being shot at from flying Harleys. Wow.**
Naryen looks after the retreating Gran, again frustrated at the lost opportunity, wishing her play to recruit them had gone better. The quote from one of her Academy instructors echoes with bitterness, ***A lack of leadership results in wasted lives.*** Like the bile in her throat over yet another failure it too is buried with trained reflex. **"Well done!"** a grateful & telling look to Tar'ja for not getting shot again & to Dexter and Chase.
Her look to Chases eyes lingers a bit showing some degree of acceptance, a nod with a somewhat relaxed smile, that she hopes convey her thoughts of ***Much better.*** She then turns her attention to the vista behind the cart & the still pressing issue.
Just as Naryen looked to the stampede, and considers their distance and the untimely slowdown to let Tar'ja endager herself to get a bike that may or may not prove to be useful, Kasga again proves his utility by bringing up his rifle to get a range on them. ***There's some Academy in you my friend!*** She lets a grateful smile relax her features as she nods to Kasga then looks back to their pursurers and the two discuss the task at hand. "Sir, That horde could roll over that town. We might have to run in one side and out the other. You still want to make 'um divert with a bang?"
She considers that briefly. Speaking more to herself than anyone **"We do what we can because we must."** she then considers the Imperial forces she saw at the town and what it implied to their deployment & compliment. **"The civilians there need any assistance we can offer, however minimal."**
She looks back to Kasga with a measure of resolve. **"Do what you can to slow them up and I'll help however I can."**

Your group continues on, Dexter even manages to gain some distance on the Tusken horde. Smiling to each other that the Tuskens are out of sight your hopes loam that they might end the chase. One look at Chase dismisses those hopes. The fledgling jedi can sense the anger the determination.
Tar`ja keeps point with the speeder racing ahead and behind to scan the area. The bike is worn like much of the tech on this planet but in working order. No mounted blaster and rudimentary controls the bike was built for the harsh conditions of this desert world. Dispite her efforts she finds no sign of the would be Gran bounty hunters.
After a few hours of travel the town appears on the horizon. Both a sign of chaos and sanctuary your group is both disappointed and relieved to see it.
In the distance one sun descends while another rises, continual sunshine with short nights. The effect plays across the sky like a brilliant portrait of yellow and orange.
As you approach the town you notice armed patrols of storm troopers. The are arranged in units of six who are effectively searching most of the towns visitors as the enter. The dewback lets out a snort announcing its desire for rest, it must sense that its destination is near.

Tar'ja slows the bike and moves to the back of the cart "We're getting close." She calls to the inside, looking over to the Duros and human woman "They're searching everyone it looks like, what should we do about the bike and..." she lifts a hand to make motion to the lilac color, a remembrance that she was still wanted and being blamed for the destruction of the people that she had escaped from with her young one.
To let them think a moment she moves up to the front and beside the dewback "Chase, hurry back into the cart and hide the light sword...be careful getting off..." she looks to the bothan then to the human with his smile "you were great out there." she says before dropping back, smoothing her features and appearing again to the two in the back of the cart.

As the Tusken look like they are gone Dexter smiles. Then looks up at his friend riding on the bantha's back. His feelings start to sink. Looking at Chase. "You and your Jedi powers. You couldn't let me just keep thinking we had won. You really know how to kill all the joy in the room." Dexter goes back to driving the cart.

**OOC:** I should have posted that Chase moved off the Dewback as I doubt he rode the creature for several hours. So I'll just run with whats been posted and make it work.
**IC.**
With the Gran in retreat Chase smiled. They had made it through and all in one piece at that. Looking back at the others he caught the nod from Deidra. What surprised him the the smile. What he felt from the Force was acceptance from the woman. At lease that's what he thought it was. He gave her a smile back and a nod of his own head.
With the beast relaxed beneath him he rather enjoyed the feeling of riding it. But they were still some ways out from the town and it was too far to ride it all the way. Carefully he made his way up and back to the cart. It was easier this time as no one was shooting at them. Back at the safety of the cart he relaxed somewhat.
After a couple hours of travel it seemed that they had lost the horde that was following them. Chase looked back behind them and reached out with the Force. There not that far back they were still there. Coming after then with anger and determination steadfast in their being. He looked to his left and looked at Deidra. The look on is face said it all. He didn't have to add words but he did. **"They're still coming. Anger resided in them. I fear that they will not stop."**
He heard Dex speak up. Humor as always was in his voice. "You and your Jedi powers. You couldn't let me just keep thinking we had won. You really know how to kill all the joy in the room."
Chase gave a half smile. **"My master always said, 'Better to know your surroundings than to be caught unaware or unarmed.' At least we know they are still coming."**
As they continued to travel he looked out to where Tar'ja was on the bike as she scooted ahead to scout and came back to the cart. He lilac color was distinctive yet beautiful. He actually wished that he hitched a ride with her when he had a chance right after the attack. He smiled as she came back this time. Behind her he could see the Storm trooper patrols. She confirmed his suspicion with her report. "They're searching everyone it looks like, what should we do about the bike and..." She indicated herself. Her coloring made her stand out and with the report out on her She'd be an easy spot. "Chase, hide the light sword." she added which he gave her a nod and removed the lightsaber from the ring on ihs belt to its concealed holster.
**"Those troopers will be a problem."** He said as he looked at the others. A smile came across his face. **"I have an idea. Kasga and Tar'ja can trade spots. This way Tar'ja can get back under the cloak to hide her coloring. We also slow down."** He saw the looks on their faces but held up a hand. **"The beast is tiring and can use a bit of rest. This will allow the horde behind us to catch up. Before they get into range we speed back up to stay ahead. When those troopers see what's behind us bearing down on them and the town I doubt they will be asking us many questions."**

Kasga responds, **"It's a good idea. The chaos will get us past the security. But those Tuskans are never going to stop coming after us. We will be unleashing them on a bunch of civilians. We also need to get this cargo transferred before we take off. The chaos will work against us there."**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2010-03-04 23:43:58)

Chase listened as Kasga made a point. The Tuskans, he called them, would be unleashed on the populace of the town. AS that thought registered he frowned. Deaths of innocents was not something he wanted. But wasn't that what the Imps were there for, protection? And the resulting chaos would be immense.
**"The chaos could work for us. the Imps would be fighting the raiders and the raiders would have someone to channel their aggression towards. We head right for Fosso's and begin loading the cargo while you and Dex get the Hdrive installed. I'm not sure how long that will take but hopefully not long. I just hope that the Imps knows whats coming. They might with their patrols and ships in space looking down."**
Chase Looked at the others nd then to Deidra. **"What do you think?"**

Tar'ja had moved to the side of their small caravan to overhear what was being said. Personally she liked the idea of having the Imps take care of the raiders behind them, make them useful and kill things that weren't harmless for a change. "Let them take care of it." She calls out to them "It's the best plan we have and we're running out of time to think of something better."
She looks up to the Jedi and nods to him "I'm all for it, but I would suggest that someone switch with me soon before someone sees me."

Approach that far edge so we don't look like the raiders are following us and also to provide Tar'ja and Kasga cover to switch places behind the cart."**
Releasing Dexters shoulder then she helps Tar'jas cover he color as she climbs back to the cart, once Kasga takes the controls of the bike to steady the transfer.

Chase stood by with his cloak as Deidra helped Tar'ja off the bike. As he handed the cloak to the Former Imperial he thanked her. **"Thanks for covering me, all of us back there."**
When the Twi'lek was aboard the cart the young Jedi handed the cloak to Deidra who helped Tar'ja get under cover. Making sure that Kasga's transfer to the bike went off with out any problems he then turned to Tar'ja came closer to her.
Reaching out he took her hand. The feel of her hand in his made him smile all the more. **"Nice job getting the bike. Now as much as I hate to see you all covered up, It would be better if you take some additional cover from the cargo."** He paused for a second then added with that smile he used for her, **"But keep your blaster handy just in case."**

Kasga slings the rifle across his back and jumps down from the cart, flexing his knees as he lands.
He walks over to the speeder and mounts up. Breathing a sigh of contentment, he checks the speeder making sure it has enough fuel and isn't overheating in the desert air.
Once he ensures the machine is in reasonable working order, he fires up the propulsion engines. He guns the engines a little, listening to the the whine, not hearing the conversation about the hyperdrive. They seem to be tuned reasonably.
Lifting his feet up, he takes off, leaning his head forward to protect his eyes from the sand.

Tar'ja brings the bike to some cover before hopping off to let the duros take over for her, taking the offered help and aid to get back into the cart and the cloak over her.
Out of the sun and out of sight she sighs in relief, looking down to the hand that took hers then up to the human with that same soft smile that was his "Can do, thank you for keeping the beast safe as well as Dex."
Giving his hand a light squeeze she moves to the cargo, taking a seat in the shadow of it and the cart, enough to hide but able to still see if she should need to.

Working together your group changes positions and turns the cart towards town. Slowing the cart your group intersects with others traveling into town. The groups are funneled together as the imperial troopers conduct their searches. Speeders carts and beasts of burden all line up for inspection.
The troopers search many of the carts while allowing others by. Ahead of you a large beast carries its Jawa owner and his cargo of assorted scrap. The Jawa is waved through by one of the storm troopers.
"Move along, move along." The trooper holds a rifle over his shoulder in one hand and with the other hand motions towards town.
Dexter moves the cart forward as the imperial storm trooper holds up his black gloved hand. "Halt! Move to the side for inspection." The trooper motions to an empty spot to the side of the line of travelers. You notice others have been pulled off to the side as well and that groups of storm troopers are inspecting cargo one by one.
The speeder in front of you is under the inspection of three troopers. Their white armor reflects the sunlight making them easy to spot against the sandy tan background. Two of the troopers silently search as a third with a red shoulder plating, marking rank questions the speeders Ithorian owner.
"What is your cargo and destination?" The trooper maintains focus on a data pad as he questions the local Ithoriam trader, only periodically looking up to relay further questioning.
The local trader complies answering the questions, his twin mouths echo in stero as he responds. "Nerf flanks from the banter sea area, I run a small farm"
Uninterested in the traders answer the trooper continues. "Are you here for business or pleasure? How long will your stay be?"
Scratching his head the Ithorian replies. "Business, I have Nerf flanks to sell, I will leave when I have sold them all."
The officer looks to his men as they jump off the speeders rear hold. "Checks out sir." "Nothing but Nerf flanks back there."
The imperial officer taps on the data pad. "Move along then, to the next cart." The ranked trooper motions to your groups cart. The officer arrives first "What is your cargo and destination?" Behind him the two trooper grunts make their way to the cart, each carrying a large rifle over one shoulder.

Curling up between cargo and pulling the cloak closer to her form to blanket her and shield her coloring she listens as a trooper tells Dex to pull to the side for inspection, a silent curse breathed out. She shifts again, moving the cloak to fall around her in an effort to look like just another shadow or part of the cart.
*Not a moment too soon* she thinks to her self, slowing her breath to ensure it wouldn't billow at the cloth and wills herself to just melt into the shadows, silently trying to tell the troopers there was nothing there. This was bad, really bad, they not only had stolen cargo but if any of those or her were discovered they weren't going to get out of there.
*Calm…silent…like a shadow* just keep thinking that...

Chase watched as the fer funneled into an inspection line despite their best efforts in avoiding it. There was no way around it. If they tried the would draw the attention of the Imperials and that would be the end of them. Looking at the others they wore the same expression as he did. Slowly the advanced on the patrol. Always watching Chase saw that they let some pass and others were waved off for inspection. Silently Chase hoped that would be in the former category.
Concentrating he reached out with the Force for the horde that was intent on pursuing them. He could still feel their anger. It was like a surging beast looking for a kill. While he could sense them he had no idea how close they were or if they were even still coming this way.
Opening his eyes he looked forward. Closer still they were to the check point. **"Dex just follow their directions for now. The last thing we want is to draw attention to our selves. We just want to look as much like merchant traders as possible."**
Soon enough they were the 2nd in line. As the trader ahead of them was waved on Dex moved the cart forward till the were next to the troopers. Chase quickly ran through a calming technique as the officer present walked up first.
"What is your cargo and destination?" The officer asked.
Chase took a step forward. ***Here goes nothing.*** He thought.
**"Various items and ship parts. We're looking to head to some dealers in town to get rid of this stuff."** Chase watched the trooper getting no evidence of facial emotions due to the helmet he wore. Relaxed and ready for whatever may happen Chase stood there looking at the officer as he kept a mental note of where the other troopers were that were also coming.
He could try the mind trick again but that was dangerous as he wasn't sure if he could pull it off again.

Dexter follows Chase's lead and does what is needed to get them through. Being a Bothan in this age was sometimes problematic at best. He basically drove the cart and made himself look more a servent to the humans rather then an equal. He pills the cart over to the side and let's Chase do the talking. He still had a little of that fear of the Troopers for what had happened to his parents but he was learning to control it.

Naryen listened to Chases directions and, agreeing to them, said nothing. She was feeling the effect of the heat now that the trip back to town had allowed her adrenaline levels to drop. Light headed, nauseous and with a pounding headache Naryen simply curled up near the front, not tying to keep out of sight, but certainly not concerned with the goings on around her. Her hood pulled up and her goggles on she tried to catalog the other people in the queues around them.
"Various items and ship parts. We're looking to head to some dealers in town to get rid of this stuff." tuning into the answer Chase gave the trooper it was true enough. Perhaps that will let them by as with the others.
She grunted as her guts clenched in a rather uncomfortable series of twists ***What? Now!? Oh no.***

Before the trooper could answer Chase heard a guttural sound coming from behind him. Turning his head to look he saw Deidra bending down over the side of the cart relatively close to one of the approaching troopers. Turning back to the officer he gave a sheepish smile waving a hand in her direction.
**"Please forgive my associate. We've been under the sun for a long time now. It's finally catching up to her."** Chase said as Deidra's back arched again attempting to empty her stomach over the side of the cart. **"We're hot, dirty, hungry and in need of a long drink to finally call this trip over."**
Again Chase looked back to where Deidra was and shook his head in sympathy. Looking back he looked to the horizon looking for the dust cloud that the raiders were kicking up hoping to see a sign of it. He looked back to the officer and waited.

It's one thing to be able to see the person making sounds of retching and such, it's another to only be able to hear it and..smell it..ugh..the twi'lek had to bite her lip to keep from joining just from the single sound. If there was a god, tehy certainly seemed to hate the small band of people.

Kasga pulled the bike up next to cart as they joined the line. Looking up at one of the suns, he pulls his hood up over his head to ward off it's effects. He keeps the bike at idle, occasionally kicking the thrusters on to keep him abreast with the cart. As he hears Chase working with the stormtrooper, he casually looks around to become aware of the other troopers positions.

The commanding trooper looks up from his data pad as Chase speaks. Looking into the cart he visually scans its contents, but ignores the human all together. Motioning with his hand the two other troopers pick up the pace.
Chase continues to talk, the imperial trooper continues to ignore the human. The other two troopers approach the cart. "Did you see the new V-220 armor upgrades?"
"Yea can`t wait till our until gets the up training."
The commanding trooper looks back down to his data pad, hitting a few keys. "Stop the chatter TK-43 and search the cart."
The first trooper grabs hold of the cart, using the side to pull himself up. Kasga notices it first then the trooper stops frozen for a moment. "Sir, we have a problem."
At those words your hearts sink all but the Duro`s pilot. The commander barley looks up from his data pad. "What is it .... ." The storm trooper drops his data pad and grabs his rifle.
"Half hanging from the side of the cart the trooper asks. "Sir, orders sir."
Your group and the lines of other travelers are still some distance from town. It would take a little while to reach the towns buildings, and safety. Behind your group about 200 meters away the horde of Tuskens have closed the distance.
Shouts of horror and orders rise up from the groups of traders and troopers. The trooper commander replies. "TK-43 call in the rain!" The trooper takes aim and begins to fire, his back up follows suit.
TK-43 opens his comm before joining. "Sir yes Sir! This is TK-43 advanced scouting unit alpha-B. He have hostiles I repeat hostiles. Calling in the rain!"
The commander looks back to your group. "Citizen you are ordered to seek shelter in town. Get out of harms way."
"Commander there are so many of them."
"Stop that chatter we are storm troopers, we have a job to do. Fire!"

As he spoke he saw that the trooper was just ignoring him. Despite this he kept at it hoping that maybe they might just get out of this yet. He paid attention to the chatter between them looking for any indication that they might be compromised.
"Stop the chatter TK-43 and search the cart." Inwardly chase sighed. On the outside his training kept his emotions under control.
A few seconds later Chase heard it. "Sir, we have a problem."
Turning around his hand moved closer to his blaster but not yet laying a hand on it. ***Here we go. It's about to get messy.*** He thought as he looks that way only to see the trooper grab for his rifle. ***Karking hell!*** But then he saw what the trooper had seen.
"Sir, orders sir." The trooper asked.
His eyes opened wide as the closeness of the horde. He estimated they were about 200 meters away.
To his side chase hears the Commander respond to the other. "TK-43 call in the rain!"
**"That's not good."** Chase said to nobody in particular as the trooper call in for help.
Still looking at the raiders chase heard the Commander order him to get to the town.
**"Um yeah…no need to tell me twice."** He took a step to Dex and slapped him on the back. **"Lets go buddy and make it fast."** As they began to pull away out of earshot of the troopers Chase spoke so that only they could hear. **"Pick the fastest route to Fosso's. This is going to get ugly. If that 'Rain' they are calling in is what I think it is we don't want to be anywhere near here."**
He reached for his encrypted comlink and pulled it out. **"SBC we're coming in hot. We'll meet you at our ride. We found what we were missing for it."** He grabbed hold of a crate to steady himself as Dex got the beast up to speed again. Hopefully it was rested enough to get them to town safely.

At Chase order Dex puts the dewback in motion. He heads for Fosso's junk yard the quickest way possiable. "Well, I am actually some what happy to the those guys this time. Those troopers are going earn there pay today." As the bantha starts to move Dex smiles. "And now for our daring escape."

Tar'ja had closed her eyes, to better make herself believe the whole shadow woman thing she was trying to tell herself. The voices were fairly loud, and they would be entering the cart any moment *stay calm..*
"Sir, we have a problem."
did they find her already?? or the crates? did they know what they were? Her hand twitched, it wanted to feel the cool handle of her blaster.
"Sir, orders sir."
Frantic voices? so...they didn't find her or the cargo?
"Lets go buddy and make it fast." That was Chase..
The cart was moving! they were free then! but..they hadn't been searched...
The lilac twi'lek waits a few moments to ensure that they were away from prying eyes before setting the cloak about her again and moving. She looks out the back, eyes wide at the horde, so close! "Well...at least they didn't search us." She offers to the others, making her way to the woman and rubbing her back "Alright there?"

Dexter snaps the reins driving the cart forward. All around you the merchants and visitors begin to pick up speed racing for the safety of town. The storm troopers have stopped searching the various carts and speeders but their number are few. Scattered groups of troopers fire into the oncoming horde of Tusken and Bantha.
Beside your cart one trooper asks. "Sir what is our target, Sir"
The answer "Your target is full auto, you can`t miss." which is followed by a spread of blaster shoot.
Behind everything the thundering charge mounts as the hostile natives charge. War cry`s, hollering, screams and slug fire mix in with the thunder of the large beasts of burden.
In the distance you can see the towns buildings and the units of storm troopers within. Throughout the landscape several other check points have been established all with groups fleeing to the safety of town. Scattered throughout them troopers fight to hold off the horde.
Ahead of your group check points of imperial troopers make way allowing the citizens to pass through. Low sirens sound warnings throughout the town adding to the chaos.
Gran, Tusken and Bantha`s oh my.

Sweating as the troopers move up to search the cart, Kasga's grip on the throddle is tense waiting for something to go wrong. The horde shows up just in time barrelling down upon the town, a wall of animals and dust.
The stormtroopers move off to deal with this more dangerous threat and Kasga's grip relaxes. As the cart moves further into the town, Kasga shadows it on the speeder, keeping pace.

**These isn&#39;t the gun toting stampede you&#39;re looking for. Move along.** 
Naryen, with her goggles now on her brow and her hooded head bent slightly over the side of the cart, wiped the corner of her mouth with a tiny grunt. In her mind echoes the voice of her Commencement Speaker, an admiral of the navy at that time now dead thanks to "Insurgent actions". ***"The pride of the Empire"… Bantha Dung!***
It was then that the voices of the troopers, an appeal for direction, caught her ear. It was all she could do, in her weakened state, not to provide orders immediately. Her body quaked slightly not from the heat sickness but from the effort of not betraying herself and her comrades and all those that died to get her this far.
The voices, so familiar, so comforting in an atmosphere of moral commitment and the clarity of being part of something greater than yourself. Of something strong and dedicated to the protection of those that can`t protect themselves.
"TK-43 call in the rain!"
"Sir yes Sir...Calling in the rain!"
"Citizen you are ordered to seek shelter in town. Get out of harms way."`
"...we have a job to do..."
With each sentence she could hear the resolve increase as training provided confidence to both voice and action. The feeling of many working as one to a common goal. It was intoxicating, and nearly overwhelming to her at that moment, as her head spun with memories from campaigns past and from the effects of the desert on one unprepared for it she could feel herself drawn to the precision and security.
Her hands hurt as they gripped the side of the cart, hard, anchoring her there as the rest of her body seemed to move of its own accord, drawn to the past for it's promise of a great future. Awash with desire for purpose and the draw for that feeling she once had of being part of that greater purpose...
***…Mom?… Dad?…***
An opened mouth, almost smiling, tightened to a tense line. Wide eyes narrowed and frowned. Her face, pointed to the troopers, for a moment beaming with pride, curled in on itself and her back followed. She turned her head away with shame and sobbed a shuttering breath as the cart moved into town.
Naryen surrendered to the chaos of an uncertain future with people that she would have once heard her former comrades call riff-raff and a small part of her would have agreed. Now she calls them friends. She reaches slowly to Dexter's shoulder and gives it a confident squeeze.
**"Steady"**
It was more to her than him, but you'd never know by the voice. She moves into town, like a coprus-leaf in a glacier stream from home, caught in the current.
As they cross the threshold into town, a point of resolve coalesces in her mind and she glances once more to the troopers. A sentiment, directed into herself for having brought the raiders to town and to the troopers for their machinelike response, leaps from her mind with spite.
***Death dealers!***

Your group sets all speed for the town, converging with the other traders, travelers and questionable locals. With the town growing larger in front of you the sights of more storm troopers appear all ready for battle. Tantooine is no imperial planet but like many know words in these dark times Tantooine is station to an imperial outpost or two.
At your six the sounds of battle rages, beast mixed with war cry`s smother out the sound of blaster shot. All around you the various groups scramble for the safety of town some at the expense of those closest to them. A cart to your side jolts as it hits a rock, its beast of burden failing to a hail of slug shot. That traders fate has been sealed.
You can hear the oncoming horde almost feel them at your back. Chaos reins all around ahead of you troopers fire at the hostile natives, though there are more then a few friendly fire casualties. To the sides the groups struggle to stay ahead, to stay alive. Behind you the hordes thunder mixes with the screams of a few slower groups.
The very ground begins to shake, all around you blaster shots from the local troopers whistle past your cart. Then another sound this time from above. A squadron of six Tie fighters ripe through the sky. Just as fast as they appear they are gone from sight. Behind you the sounds of explosions replace the thunder of the horde. The squadron must have been outfitted for bombing runs, as you look behind you the Tuskens are scattering broken by the empires superior fire power.
At town troopers wave the groups inside, leaving inspections for later everyone hastily enters town. A few streets in locals are browsing the nearby markets, all is back to normal. Fosso`s is not far from here.

Kneeling near Dex, Chase watched as events unfolded. The town came closer as all those that were told to find shelter in the city tried to do so. Not all made it as he watched as the beast pulling the cart next to them falter and fall.
Through the Force he could sense the fear in the other carts occupants. He also felt something else as he looked at Deidra. A sense of pride he thought he felt as the troopers responded with their usual efficiency. ***Mixed feelings maybe. To leave behind everything you have known only to be thrown in with those you would normally wouldn't consider trustworthy.***
He watched the shorter woman come up to where he was kneeing. He nodded as she gave a word of support to Dex who was driving the beast onward. He looked at Deidra. He dark hair and ice blue eyes a sharp contrast to her light colored skin. **"The troopers work well together. There's no doubt they are well trained. There's no shame in feeling pride in how they work together for today they are saving out collective butts. Even I'm glad right now for their training."**
His words were cut off. not from the blaster fire or the cries of battle that were happening all around them but the rumble from over head. Looking up he saw 6 Ties cross over them and lay their ordinance into the horde. The destruction they left in their wake was overwhelming. **"Efficient they are."** He said to no one in particular as the ties banked away and the deaths of many so close to him came to him through the Force. The feeling of the massacre fell across his features.
He looked at Dex and patted his shoulder. **"Fosso's right away."**
He stood up and went over to where Tar'ja was still sitting the deaths of the horde still lingered and it showed on his face. He sat down next to her, legs crossed. He reached out his hand and gently placed it on her shoulder as he leaned up against the crates. **"I think we're going to get out of here Tar'ja."** He said to her as he closed his eyes and let his head rest against the crate. **"All we have to do is fix the ship and avoid anyone we don't want to run into."**
The last part of what he said made him open his eyes. The Gran leader. he was still out there. He looked at Tar'ja. **"We still have that gran to worry about."** Standing up he smiled at the beautiful Twi'lek that sat next to him. The cloak that she wore, despite its ability to hide things, couldn't hide everything.
He began to look around and spoke so the others could hear. **"We still have that Gran to worry about. Best keep an eye out for him."**
They entered the city not long after. Recognizing where they were he knew they weren't far from Fosso's.
OOC:
Perception +9 to keep an eye out for anyone following them. ie the gran or anyone else for that matter.

### **zerah** (2010-03-29 18:33:24)

Tar'ja watched silently as the emotions flitted over the woman's face, the turn in emotions that crossed over her was really quite fascinating in some strange aspect...however being ignored..well...
Pale blue eyes narrow, fine, she didn't have to ask anyway only thought it would have been polite. No matter, the twi'lek simply turns and moves to the crates taking a seat as she waits for them to slow and stop, the tell tale sign that they would have reached their destination and that she could begin unloading the items.
Lost in her thoughts and silent words of disgruntlement at the human female she was slightly surprised when the shadow that had moved over her sat down. A pat to her shoulder, while less than what she may have wanted though appropriate for their current standing on the run, still made her feel light and relieved, the woman forgotten for the moment as she smiles to the Jedi "I think we're going to get out of here Tar'ja. All we have to do is fix the ship and avoid anyone we don't want to run into."
She offers a short snort of a laugh, there luck hadn't been that kind to allow them to avoid anyone they didn't want to run into. "Somehow I feel as though the hardest part of this is yet to come." She looks to him, taking a brief moment to lock eyes with him, taking his hand from her shoulder and just hold it "but I hope we succeed in this endeavor..."
At his mention of the gran...that damned gran she frowns, they still hadn't seen him since the battle, he could be anywhere now. She watches him stand and move back to the others, taking this moment to look out the back and keep her eyes aware, even if they wished to stray to something more pleasant.
Soon enough...they would be in the air and away from here and she could let them roam where they liked.

The path ahead descends into chaos, as Kasga guns it toward town. After a moment, he realizes he’s outpacing the cart and he eases back on the throttle. He cuts in and out of the panicing civilians as they rush for the cover the town offers. His flight training kicks in allowing him to remain aware of the radically changing retreat. He settles in front of the cart just a little, trying to lead a path through the pandemonium.
As the flight of TIEs drop in overhead, he can’t help but glance up, admiring their efficiency. When we take off, those will be who we’ll have to contend with.
A fleeing ronto collides with a stall sending its structure and contents cascading into Kasga’s path. Cursing himself for a fool, he leaves off future trouble focusing on the now.

Dexter drives the cart through the gates and toward Fosso's. He hears the sounds of battle and ducks a little when the Tie's come screaming in and unload on the Tuskins. "You know once I get this Hyperdrive in, we are still going to have to blast our way out of here. I hope we have a hot shot pilot with us. Computers and engines are one thing flying is another. All though I do have to say that sense I have met you guys my life has been anything but boring. I do with a little less of the life and limb though." Dexter smiles like he was starting to enjoy what was going on.

**This isn&#39;t the gun toting stampede you&#39;re looking for. Move along.** 
With a little bit more of her former life now behind her, Naryen looks more to her surroundings. She is immediately disappointed by what she notices. The troopers weren't apparently, organizing into battery columns and tsyphoning the retreating civilians between them. It was manifesting more like a mad crush of flesh into the town. Thankfully their cart seemed a little better off as they arrived near where Fosso has the ship.
Chase offered some reassurance about shame and pride revealing something quite comforting to Naryen at that moment. ***For all that un-natural insight he really hasn't a clue!*** His tone changes slightly as he mentions their efficiency at delivering death. ***… or a little, though I expect he thinks I don't appreciate what little he's aware of.*** She sighs. ***A lot of work to do there.***
He then, after flirting with his mark, mentions his worry over the Gran mercenary complication and Dexter adds jovial assessment. Naryen nearly giggles and her tone starts off reflecting that.
**"We need to be cautious of the Gran, I agree, but we have a larger problem."** A brief pause as she continues. **"The raider attack was simply a live fire exercise, for them, but it did stop their inspections."** Here her tone deepens with the implications as she tries to give it the weight it deserves. **"They will, no doubt, sweep the town after they are done with the raiders. If it's any of us they're looking for I'd like to be gone before they get to us."**
Then to Dexter **"After we're of this rock I wouldn't mind being a little bored."** A grin splits her face and infects her words **"For a little while anyway."**

Now traversing the onslaught of local traders your group presses on. Waving away yet another Jawa offer to trade you turn the corner to Fosso`s.
Outside his scrapyard is more or less the same. One might notice a few missing parts or a few additional items or varying value. Fosso`s Jawa associate motions for your group to go around to the back by waving his little arms yelling. "Ashuna ashuna. Ookwass Umka Dkkan."
There is barely enough room to squeeze the cart through a side alley. Most of the debris and junk has been removed and about ten meters down the shaded alley is a partially opened sliding door. The door leads inside the hanger bay, you can only see darkness within. The door is built of the same material as the building itself many would have passed it by as it nearly blends into the wall. No handles or viewing portal the door is large enough to allow your entire cart access.
Looking around there is no sign of Fosso or the droid SBC. The little Jawa seems content and continues to haggle the yard wares. "Utto Nye usabia atoonyoba?"

### **ganthet** (2010-04-03 15:39:37)

As Dexter moves the cart around the back of Fosso's and into the area he was directed to park he stops it and lets out a sigh. "Well that was fun. Now I get to do my impression of a grease monkey. Anyone want to help me carry this thing inside and I can get started?" Dexter hops off the cart and checks on the Hyper Drive they had found. "I hope this thing survived the trip here. Would hate to go through all that for nothing."
((OCC: Mechanics check +13 I think. Checking over the Hyper drive to make sure it is still in working order.))

"They will, no doubt, sweep the town after they are done with the raiders. If it's any of us they're looking for I'd like to be gone before they get to us." Deidra had said as she looked around.
He nodded in agreement. **Agreed the quicker the hdrive can be installed the better. then we will have to worry about the blockade.**
With her comment about down time he looked at Tar'ja. ***Yes. Some down time would be nice. I wonder…*** His thoughts trailed off as he thought about what she liked and didn't like. Favorite things to do when she wasn't being chased across a desert while trying to escape an Imperial blockaded planet. ***Finding out those things will have to wait. We still have to get off the planet.*** He began looking around for any trouble sign of the Gran and Imperial troopers.
As Dex pressed on through the city the group had to shoo away several Jawa's on the way to Fosso's. When they arrived the trade merchants place looked relatively the same. some things were gone that were replaced with new items.
The little Jawa that the Fosso's associate waved them around the back side. "Ashuna ashuna. Ookwass Umka Dkkan." It had said. Not understanding it at all he just rode along as Dex followed.
They stopped next to a half open door. If opened it would easily allow them entrance into the hanger where they could get to work on the ship. Looking around there was no sign of Fosso or SBC. All he could see was the little Jawa. **"Someone want to open that hanger door so we can get under cover."**
Chase hopped down and looked at the Jawa. **"Where's Fosso. We have business to finish. Has our droid been here?"**

Kasga pulls the swoop in out of the way of the cart. He winds the thrusters down slowly. He drops the swoop stand, then kills the repulsors. He swings his leg over then stands up and stretches his arms up over his head. Stepping up to the hanger door, he opens it up just a little bit more so the cart can go in.

Finally they had reached Fassos,they could get off the planet now and get out of the system before the imperial scum could know they were gone.
At least that was her ideal plan for all of this.
Shifting about in the cart she watches the bothan examine the hdrive, while she moved up to take his seat at the reins to lead the cart into the hanger. With the doors opening a bit more from Kasga she clicks her tongue against her teeth as a signal for the beast to move "Nearly there, then you can rest." she says to the beast, wondering if it understood that relaxation was close at hand.
Glancing to her side at the Jedi and back again she wondered what downtime would bring, she could hope for learning more about him, though she wasn't sure he'd enjoy hearing anything of her past...
A frown crosses her lips hidden under the hood of the cloak, eyes narrowing in thought of the past, it was the past but it haunted her.
Lekku twitching the twi'lek shakes her head to rid her thoughts, later...she'd tell them later so at least they'd know...after all of this she owed it to them.

Dex was looking over the Hyper Drive when he heard someone ask about how long it would take to install it. "Well that depends on a lot of things, interuptions, if I have help or , if it got damaged on the way here. I will of course make all do haste." He really couldn't tell at this point how much time he would need.

### **master_Tru** (2010-04-08 16:15:56)

Dexter moves the cart around the back stopping just shy of the side door. Inside his head he begins calculations on Hdrive installation. Without looking at the actual ship the drive could be installed in a few minutes or less as long as there where no unforeseen issues. The Hdrive itself seems intact though when it has power again a full diagnostic could be run.
The Jawa fails to answer Chase`s question on where is Fosso, and continues to swindle the crowd. "Utto Nye usabia atoonyoba!"
When Kasaga parks his swoop he hears the unmistakable sound of flapping wings. "Ah is good to be seeing you again. Come come inside." The Toydarian begins to pull the door open motioning for The Duro`s to help. "I was being afraid you not be making it back, lots of stories going round. The empire, hunters ...." The merchant trails off as he looks closely at the bike. "Nice ride you have there, I hope you did not kill anyone I know to get it." At that the rotund Toydarian Chuckles.
With the door open your cart can now enter. Fosso motions your group inside. "Come we have much to discuss. Where is your droid? I was thinking he would come back with you he went looking for you."

The Droid wasn't there? Wonderful. well...maybe he'd be back..or...something.
Shaking her head under the hood she looks to the others then over to Dex "If you need some help I wouldn't mind lending you hand. I don't know a lot about this stuff but..I know what the tools look like at least." Anything to get the off this rock faster.
To get off the rock in question brought up another question to her mind that was voiced "By the by...who's going to fly this thing? I can fly a bit, but have any of you a better skill at it?"
At least perhaps two of them could fly, a pilot and co..that might make things a bit easier with getting out..

**The calm before&#8230;** 
The banter around her provides little comfort and Naryen starts to feel tense. Entirely too much experience with moments of calm leading to moments of scrambling for life. She considers that for a moment, with a little grin, as she looks around the shop. ***Odd where I'm finding humor these days… where is that droid?***
She starts to looks around, as Fosso enters escorting Kasga, and finds herself suddenly relieved that her Durros companion is ok. ***…I must have been worried about him.***
Dexters prudent offer to work on the ship doesn't go unnoticed. **"I may be able to help as well."** then, with a nod acknowledging Fosso, addresses more to the group but a hopefully meaningful look to Chase **"How long are we going to wait?"** ***…if?***

Once the door is open, Kasga dials the repulsors up to the minimal level, then pushed the swoop inside. Once everyone is in doors, Kasga slides the door shut.
Tarja's voice carries inside the hanger. Kasga catches her eye. He responds, **"I've logged thousands of flight hours. I think I'll be flying. If there's an even reasonable chance this tub can make it through. That's an open question at this point."**
He walks over to Deirdra. In a low voice, Kasga warns, **"I smell a trap."** Turning away, he looks over at Dex. **"Hey Dex what's that?"**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Rebaav** (2010-04-13 10:49:55)

**Mos Eisley - Fossos place - Considering how good the bait smells.**
Kasga enters and announces he's the best choice for pilot. Nothing to debate with there as his kind is well known for it.
That thought rolls around in Naryens head for a moment. ***His kind. His *kind*.*** it has a residue to it she dislikes. The jokes, and sometimes the propaganda, that frequented the the University, and sometimes her comrades at arms while on tour, had that kind of bias to it. Something subtle yet intrusive, it grated against her nature like a misplaced flavor in a otherwise masterfully prepared meal.
Kasgas change of tone, and volume, caught her ear and brought her back to the moment. "I smell a trap." The suggestion cascaded through her mind, resonating in various places. She smiled at the sharp mind in her friend that confirmed things within her, some she wasn't fully aware of, as he continued to speak with the others like everything was fine, relatively speaking. ***Some lessons we can all take from you, especially myself it seems.***
With a nod of agreement and a glance to Chase, Naryen matches Kasgas low volume but increased intensity, though her expression registers nothing but a calm grin. **"A plant to draw out those with the drive & inclination. A single droid. Subtly is not something I've been exposed to in my life but my experience is rather narrow."**
***A quote from her Tactics manual: "Those that think the enemy has but one side think that they will come from only one side. It is then that their end is met as their enemy attacks from where they are not observed."***
**"What we face may have more than one side." *…we need to be cautious.*** The latter she feels is conveyed adequately without words as the cordial sparkle leaves her eyes for a moment.

### **zerah** (2010-04-13 14:03:58)

Tar'ja shakes her head to the bothan "Nothing, get the drive in quick though for us dex." She glances to the others, the tension in the room and their expressions in low tones had her concerned, the thought of a trap was going through her mind.
She didn't like the idea of the cover of the hanger even with it's advantage. Shifting her blaster from her belt to her hand and brushing the cloak off to the side to better allow movement she looks to the others, the question in her eyes without being spoken before her gaze turns to look around the hanger.
the best place to fire from, the most shadows, and the best places to be surrounded were her top priority.

Dex smiles. "Of course my Lady." He bows deeply one hand flourishing his cloak. He then turns and lifts the hyper drive carrying over to the ship to start his work. "Hmm this could be interesting. Never worked on a ship like this before." He pulls out his tools and takes off his cloak and begins working.

Chase had listened to the others as they spoke in hushed tones with meanings that didn't escape him. As Dex went off to install the hyper drive he spoke to the other 3 that were there.
**"Trap maybe but that would imply other things."** He lowered his voice for those right next to him. **"That would mean that the person who told us to go to the cafe is also in on this. That is a sobering thought considering what we left back there in her care. I knew her husband and he had no love for the Empire that much I know. Yet if the droid isn't here what does it mean?"** At the mention of Dosennaa he looked at both Deidra and Tar'ja. For they left something more valuable than credits in her care.
He looked at Fosso. **"When was the last time you saw the droid and has the it finished its dealings with you for the ship? Are we free to take it now?"** If the answer was yes then they could make it ready to go. But go where? If it was no then they were really stuck.
After Fosso's answer he looked back to the three of them. **"SBC didn't answer me when I last tried to contact him when we were entering the city. Should I try again?"** He held up his comlink. **"Its encrypted as is his and I can keep it short to minimize getting a trace on it if that would help. It's not exactly my area of expertize."** He said with a half smile looking at Deidra who would most certainly know more about tracing a comm signal than he would.

Dread, that was a new feeling.
This...heart stopping, cold sweat bringing dread...
It washes over the lilac woman, her eyes widening, the idea of them...finding her little Lyn'aris and doing stars only knew...
Her gaze shifts from the Jedi to the woman, they had one common link, they had each left a child in the care of Dosennaa and the notion of the imperials getting to her...
This had to be what a mother felt, a real one, that was related by blood and such..this was what they must feel when a child was in danger when the simple idea was brought up "Can we get them before we leave." she tried so hard to keep her voice steady, to keep the fear, the panic from it, she had been trained better than to let those through but the idea...the attachment she had grown with the girl...
maybe she was a real mother after all..

Letting his commanding officer chew over his idea, Kasga focuses on Dex's part. **"Why do we want to wait to install a backup hyperdrive? We should go ahead and get out of here."**

### **Rebaav** (2010-04-15 12:50:58)

**Mos Eisley - Fossos place - Considering how good the bait smells.**
At Tar'jas mention of "them", Naryens eyes harden as her memories of her raped home incorporate images of the children left in Dossannas care, especially Laelah. Firm, almost violently driven, resolve clears emotional reaction but not before the pain and fear flashes across her face. Her compose becomes reminiscent of the glaciers of home. Aware of this her resolve only deepens further as yet another reminder of her failures drives her forward.
**"They are safer where they are, I suspect, but we can discuss that later."** Looking to Tar'ja she tries to offer some reasurance **"We will go where they cannot so that they need not do what we must!"** She holds her gaze, rich with support and resolve so that it may lend her ... ally, some strength while maintaining the distance the Twi'lek seems to find more comfortable from her.
Once Tar'ja seems more composed Naryen looks to Chase. **"We must press on though I suspect launches and communication traffic, of any kind, will be far more scrutinized. We may end up bringing a sweep upon us sooner."** Something then occurs to her and she shares it. **"That may give us a chance to act if we can appear innocuous."**
A nod then, **"It may be worth the risk."**

Fosso flaps his wings as he circles the bike then the cart. "Cargo you be having that might come in handy." At Kasga`s comment on his pilot skills the Toydarian snaps back a typical sales pitch. "This ship is easy to fly that be knowing, and for one such as yourself an easy fit." The merchant waves your group in as the hushed conversations begin, the sound of the door sliding closing shut marks your groups safe return to town, the door locks as it settles into place.
Dexter heads for the ship Hdrive in tow. The ramp is still open the sparse interior well lite. The Bothan sets himself for an installation of the drive hoping for no complications.
At Chases question Fosso replies "The droid went looking for you, as I said many stories. Some say you are enemy of the empire, others say you got in with the wrong crowd. Fosso no care Fosso only want to make a deal." The Toydarain merchant coughs slightly then continues "There is the matter of departure fees as well as hanger fees. Perhaps you have something to trade!"

### **Yogi** (2010-04-18 23:34:36)

Chase saw the worry that came across Tar'ja's face and felt it again through the Force when he mentioned about the little ones with Dossenna and her possible connection to the Imperials. However, he had known her husband and he had no love for the Empire. It wasn't a concern for him. Yet.
Chase noticed Fosso circling the cart and the bike and waved them in as they began talking. With the door closing he relaxed a bit but not totally.
When Tar'ja asks about going to get them Deidra who also had stake in this spoke up. He found himself nodding with her words. ***I'm glad she agrees. Either way would be bad. We could be going back to where Imperials could be waiting for them or leading the Imperials to Dossenna and the children which would be worse if the situation was the latter and they were already safe.***
He looked at Tar'ja. **"She right. For now they are safe. Also if we take off and head to there we could be leading them right to the little ones."**
Fosso enters the conversation with an answer to the droids whereabouts. "The droid went looking for you, as I said many stories. Some say you are enemy of the empire, others say you got in with the wrong crowd. Fosso no care Fosso only want to make a deal." Chase didn't miss the fake cough as the Toydarain continued. "There is the matter of departure fees as well as hanger fees. Perhaps you have something to trade!" The winged alien said as he looked over the cart.
**"We may have something to trade. Did the droid say where it was going?"** Chase grabbed his comlink and got ready to call SBC as he waited for the merchants answer.

Dex walks into the ship. He turns to anwser his friend, "this is the Hyper Drive we found on that ship we got the cargo from." He heads in, hanging his cloak somewhere and takes out his tool pouch he wishes he had a something to drink after being in the open desert. He was going to have to spend a day in the fresher trying to get all the sand out of his fur. He moves to the engineering area and starts to work. This shouldn't take to long.

Tar'ja's gaze stayed to the one other woman in their group, but besides that she too was a 'mother' with a child elsewhere; she knew what it felt like to hear the little ones may be in trouble or have danger at their door.
"We will go where they cannot so that they need not do what we must!" Pale blue eyes look down as she thinks that over. She had wanted to join this endeavor all the more now that she had the little one, to make a life better for her where she could do anything she wanted and not have to worry about someone looking to her as only some pretty thing to take for a bar or slave labor.
"She right. For now they are safe. Also if we take off and head to there we could be leading them right to the little ones."
"You're right..." she says softly looking back and eying them both "you both are..." She shakes her head and flops down, taking this moment to build up her wall again. Too many emotions had filtered through during their time together. This group was getting under her skin and into her defenses...she wasn't quite sure how she felt about it.
Breathing deeply and setting her mask into place again she stands moves towards the cargo "try calling him again, we need to get out of here."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2010-04-22 21:38:46)

"You're right..." Chase heard Tar'ja say softly as she looked back and forth between Deidra and himself. "You both are..." She finished. Looking at her he could feel the shift in her emotions. Still not quite on the ball with the emotions it felt like she was bottling it up trying to hide it. He sighed as he wasn't sure.
He looked at Deidra as the Twi'lek sank to the floor. He looked back to Tar'ja and was about to say something when She stood back up and moved to the cargo. "Try calling him again, we need to get out of here."
Chase nodded and took up his comlink again. Before he spoke into it he looked at Deidra and spoke loud enough for Tar'ja to hear also. Doing something may help her keep her mind off the little one. **"See what we cargo we can trade with Fosso for the fees he was talking about. The quicker we can be free of him the better."**
He raised the comlink up to his mouth and turned it on. He tried to keep it casual like they did in the holovids. **"Boss, you there? Were ready to get going. When are you coming back?"** He looked back at the door that had just been closed. Glad for the cover that it provided. He looked at the ship wondering how Dexter and Kasga were doing with the hyperdrive. He looked again at the comlink, It was still on. He was beginning to wonder if the droid had found himself some trouble when it went out to look for them.
**"Where could he be."** He said to no one in particular.

Tar'ja turns at the Jedi's voice, nodding her head as she looks over to the human woman and motions her head towards the cargo as she moves towards, rummaging through the cargo for something that wasn't what they needed to give to the droid but something that needed to be of some kind of value.

She looks off, to nowhere in particular, and removes her goggles, mask & peels back her hood. Shaking the sand from her features, and carefully wiping her still sunburned face clear of sweat caked grit, she turns to Fosso with a smile and shifts her posture a little. Her voice rolls with relaxed melodious tones. **"Fosso, do you have some place a couple of girls can get cleaned up?"** she looks back to Chase, with a pout expression and tone, **"I'm dirty."**

Fosso flaps around Chase at the mention of more trading. "The droid Sb ... C? did not say where it was going only that it would not be long. It only just left, should be back soon I think." Fosso rubs his chin, "Whats you be having to trade, docking and fuel fees not cheap you know. Not that you would get far with all the empire in the sky`s?"

Dexter enters the ship taking the forward ramp. A long ship The Bothan makes for the engine room in the rear of the twenty meter ship. Inside the ship is as you left it bare empty and clean. At the engine room the access door is locked the panel showing a red light indicating the blocked access.

Fosso`s eyes widen when the young jedi make his com call to SBC. With a little more urgency in his voice the trader continues "Though I am sure the contents on your cart should cover the fees, what are you hauling?"
The Toydarian looks to Tar`ja then to Deidra. "Yos can clean up on the ship within the refresher. Me and your friend here can work out a deal, yes?" The last statement directed at Chase.

Tar'ja glances up from the corner at the mention of cleaning up, the notion of getting clean and the dirt and sand out of her clothes sounded like a blessing. Glancing to the woman she nods towards the ship "lets take some time to clean then hm? We can help move things after."
Looking over to Chase she eyes, him, too many people to offer his smile but it showed in her eyes at least "We'll return, not too far away at that." she looks over to the woman again "though I'd be happy to clean later and help you now..."
A tough choice, on one had there's finishing a mission, on the other getting sand and grime off. Likely she'll stay to help him unless pulled elsewhere.
"Though I am sure the contents on your cart should cover the fees, what are you hauling?" The twi'lek frowns, maybe cleaning would have to wait. Pale blue hues narrow at the urgency in the toydarian's voice, the wide eyes not going unnoticed, what was he hiding?

Chase ignored the Toydorian as he flapped closer to them talking about fees. His call to SBC seemed to go ignored. It was after his call that he took notice of the trader. There seemed to be a bit of urgency in the aliens voice.
"Though I am sure the contents on your cart should cover the fees, what are you hauling?"
Chase cocked his head slightly as he looked at Fosso as he continued. "Yos can clean up on the ship within the refresher. Me and your friend here can work out a deal, yes?"
He looked at Tar'ja when Fosso mentioned about them cleaning up. He didn't see her smile but he thought he saw the look in her eyes. He also saw her eyes shift as if she caught the shift on Fosso's demeanor.
He watched Tar'ja move gracefully over to him ans Deidra looked over his way. The seriousness of her expression told him that he wasn't imagining things.
"Why's he's so anxious when you contacted SBC?" He heard Tar'ja whisper into his ear. The warmth of her breath sent a shiver down his spine.
**"I don't know but we'll find out.**
Looking at the Toydarian he heard Deidra speak out. "Do you think this Toydarian is scamming us?"
Chase smiled. ***Leave it to the Deidra to get to the point straight away.*** He thought as he hooked his thumb on his belt close to his blaster. The move wasn't overtly threatening but the obvious was stated by the move.
"Call SBC again, a simple question about a business transaction is safe enough." She said matter of fact.
With his other hand he raised the comlink back up. **"I'm on it."** He said as he looked at Fosso. **"Boss is the deal done? He says we still owe him for fees? Does that sound right to you?"**
Chase looked at Fosso. He thought about using the Force to get some insight on Fosso's emotions but even he could see with his eyes that Fosso seemed a bit on edge. **"He should still be within range if he only just left. Where was it you sad he went looking for us?"**

Fosso flashes the former imperial agent a quick glare at the mention of scamming. "Fosso only trying to get the best deal for Fosso, plus Fosso knows you be getting a good deal to." The Toydarian motions to the long segmented Gymsnor-3 class starship.
(For Dexter and Kasgas eyes only)
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Inside Dexter decides to turn retreating to the group outside. As he turns Kasga enters the area having followed the Bothan inside the ship. The Duros had been admiring the Corellian craftsmanship.
From behind the door the muffed voice comes through again, this time Kasga hears it as well. "Boss is the deal done? He says we still owe him for fees? Does that sound right to you?"

</details>

For the second time Chase sends the droid a signal and for the second time the jedi receives no response. Fosso circles the human force learner eying him up and down. "You make the choices in this group? What say you? Fosso has children to feed bills to pay, the fees I have mentioned are common in these parts."

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2010-05-03 10:34:15)

Again he got no response from SBC. ***What's going on here. The droid doesn't seem like it would be one to just run off. At least not from what I have seen from it.*** He looked over at Tar'ja nd then to Deidra and shrugged since he had no idea why SBC wasn't responding. Still it didn't change the fact that Fosso's demeanor changed somewhat withing the last few moments.
He looked at Fosso as the winged alien now circled him. Its small eyes watching him closely. "You make the choices in this group? What say you? Fosso has children to feed bills to pay, the fees I have mentioned are common in these parts." Fosso directed at him/
***If we irritate him more it could blow the deal. Karking hell where is the droid?***
Not wanting to be stranded on this planet any longer Chase forced a smile even though his body language didn't initially match his facial expression. A few seconds later his body seemed to relax a bit as he took a long breath.
**"Fosso my well rereputed friend we know that fees are are part of the bargin and that I'm sure you have many mouths to feed and rent to pay,"** Chase began as he looked at the Toydarian. **"But you must understand our droid, who I'm sure that you know is very competant with its dealings, was supposed to take care of all these small but important details so that we would not have to. Surely we can wait a few more minutes to get this all straightened out. and if the misunderstanding is on our part I'm sure we can compensate you for the trouble."** Chase waved a hand nonchalantly at the cart. It was not an accident that he did not answer if he was the one making the decisions for the group.
He kept the smile but took another breath. ***I really dislike negotiations like this. Negotiations with a lightsaber is much faster.*** He chuckled inwardly at the thought as it brought a memory of his master out of the recesses of his mind to the forefront. ***Master I wish you were still here. I still have much to learn.***

**Mos Eisley - Fossos place - Considering how good the bait smells.**
Naryen, still playing her role, shows Fosso an appropriately admonished expression even casting her eyes down before Fosso turns away. ***There. Adequetely baited,*** When Fosso turns away she looks to Chase, ***now you're turn.*** She revels in the game that doesn't involve lives, for a change.
At Chases answer her eyes widen in astonishment. ***Well played!*** Naryen shoots the same glance at Tar'ja, but with a smile to share with her and raised eyebrows, then turns back to the negotiating pair. With a pout, downcast eyes and a matching demeanor of submission, **"I want to clean up, but the ship's totally not ours yet."** With an expression of seemingly increased resolve she volunteers **"I thought SBC had better to offer than we have for those fees."** Her face then shows confusion and frustration, as she wipes her clothing of sand again.
**"Where is he?"** Now that she's had a moment to consider, the details of the fees Fosso mentioned does seem a little out of pattern for the droid. She turns that puzzled expression to Fosso, showing a joy-girl with a little more confidence in her question, if not herself, but still maintaining the submissive posture.

Tar'ja glances to the human woman, then the jedi and back, so then they were playing game with him? ugh, she hated these things, shooting them was so much easier and less complicated in the end. Still, something wasn't right and it was grating on her; he had gotten nervous when they mentioned the droid, and went right into trying to get money out of them...money that should have been paid while they were gone.
If she recalled correctly, the droid had made mention of completing things hadn't he? True things were hard to understand than but from what Chase had heard it seemed things were settled..
The lilac twi'lek hums as she leans against the Jedi "say...where exactly..did you say the droid went off to again? Not far right? So things will be taken care of.." She looks over to the woman, might as well get a bit cleaned "Come on." she says moving to the girl and taking her hand tugging lightly "I want to get clean.." hell if she could do the ditzy routine so could the twi'lek, maybe it'll distract the flying creature or something.

Those guys must be some of Fosso's repair guys. Let's see why they're worried about getting paid, but let's not spook them. Kasga eases his pistol down by his side. He triggers the door open switch. Peering around the open door, he smiles, **"Hey fellas."**

Chase looked at Deidra as she continued with the act that she perpetrated earlier with Fosso. "I want to clean up, but the ship's totally not ours yet." She said with the typical joy-girl enthusiasm she showed before. He looked back to Fosso as she continued on about SBC.
He raised an eyebrow as he looked at the Toydarian Waiting for its response. If the alien was about to speak it was interrupted by Tar'ja as he felt her body lean against his as she began to hum. Keeping up with the act he let his arm snake around her as his hand came to a rest on her hip. He was keeping up with the act the two of them were putting on. Though to be honest he needed no prompting when it came to getting close to Tar'ja as the beautiful alien had stirred up emotions in him that been dormant for a while.
"Say...where exactly..did you say the droid went off to again? Not far right? So things will be taken care of.." The Lilac skinned beauty purred as she talked. She then gracefully left his side and took Deidra's hand tugging her gently towards the ship. "I want to get clean.."
He simply smiled as he watched the two women play the roles of ditzy joy-girls. Knowing the two of them it seemed so far from the mark of who they really were. He nearly laughed out loud but managed to keep the smile in place.
**"Go ahead girls. Our friend here said all was accounted for except the docking and fuel fees. So as far as I'm concerned the Droid arranged for purchase of the ship and it's ours now. Go clean up. I hope to be there soon to join you both."** He said with a certain tone and an emphasized wink for Fosso's benefit.

Fosso waves his hands in the air as he changes direction and circles the human jedi in the opposite direction. "Fosso knows not where your droid be, and Fosso could not care. Fosso be needs credits, your credits or the next buyers." The Toydarian now floats towards the cart, the Dewback lets out a snort as it moves to the hanger bay floor. "Yous through in the mount and the cart and Fosso be thinking that's good credits for fees."

Inside the ship both Dexter and Kasga stand ready outside the engine room door. Kasga is the first to move trying the door the Duros realizes its locked. The simple key pad entry panel lights up and the pilot try`s a few combination's to open the door.

Fosso now starts to look around his eyes darting here and there, over your group, the ship cart speeder and then to the hanger door. Looking at Chase the Toydarian floats up to meet the human`s gaze eye to eye. The merchants foul breath assaults Chases senses as he speaks. "Fosso be needing an answer or Fosso be canceling the deal. Find another ship for such a good deal ..." The junk trader laughs out loud. "Fosso be thinking not in these parts."

Between Dexter and Kasga the pair manage to bypass the simple lock and the double door slides open. Inside the engine room panels and displays are light, the Bothan reconizes much of this to indicate a systems check, with the exception of a few systems the ship is in working order.
Laying flat on the engine room floor you find the protocal driod SBC. On the droids metal chest you also notice a grey droid inhibitor obviously shorting the droids systems and rendering it off line.

Fosso changed direction and circled the other way. "Fosso knows not where your droid be, and Fosso could not care. Fosso be needs credits, your credits or the next buyers."
Chase didn't need the Force to see that the Toydarian was now really nervous. Something was really bothering him. "Yous through in the mount and the cart and Fosso be thinking that's good credits for fees."
The Jedi's eyes hardened as he looked at the winged alien the situation had gone on long enough. Something was wrong **"What do you take me for? Some back water farm boy. Docking fees don't cost that much and we both know it."** He said as he watched Fosso. The aliens eyes were darting everywhere then finally back at the Jedi as it came face to face with him. Chase wrinkled his nose a bit as the foul stench of Fosso's breath washed across his senses. It was then that the ultimatum came.
"Fosso be needing an answer or Fosso be canceling the deal. Find another ship for such a good deal ..." He said with a laugh. "Fosso be thinking not in these parts." He added.
If a look could separate an arm or wing from a body Chase would not have needed his lightsaber at this moment. He was being forced to make a decision now or loose the deal. Something was up but even the Force could not tell him what. All it told him was that Fosso was on edge, nervous. Hiding something maybe. He just wasn't sure.
Chase sighed and dropped his head sign of defeat. **"Half of the goods on the cart along with the cart and mount and that will cover these fees you speak of but first…"**
In case SBC was out there somewhere he tried one last time and brought up the comlink as he hopped up on to the cart with ease. **"Boss it looks like I'll have to trade most of the supplies along with the cart and beast for the docking fees Fosso says we still owe."**
He looked back at Fosso. A distasteful look on his face. **"There's one thing I dislike the most in this galaxy it is one who takes advantage of others. This time it looks like I have no choice in this matter. Lets go over your 'fees' Fosso. Because I doubt you'll find another buyer willing to pay what we have…"** he paused for a moment. **"At least in these parts and that's what I be thinking."**

Tar'ja watches the toydarian, the way his eyes moved to the ship and back to them the nervousness in his voice, and the sudden change to threatening to take away their ship...
She narrows her eyes, screw the ploy. Her hand moves to her blaster and rests there in a simple show she wasn't past using it to settle this. "You seem to be awfully nervous about that ship.." she says slowly, moving around to stand beside the human Jedi "Far too nervous for one just wanting fees. What's on there that you don't want us to know about? Are you trying to smuggle something without our knowledge? Trying to get something past those Imperials? or are you trying to get more money from us when these fees have already been paid?"
She was tired, she was dirty, she hated sand, and she wanted off the damn planet; she was not a happy twi'lek and she was close to loosing her temper. She eyes him as her own pale blue narrow "Your nervousness is giving you away." She looks to the human "I be thinking that there's more to this than he's letting on."

Kasga looks around the engine room, bare of personnel. Looking down at the inert form of SBC, he swears, **"Karking Hell! Now I know it's a trap. At least the droid's been shut down. It'll just save me from doing it myself."**
Kasga holsters his pistol and digs out his comlink. He double taps the link transmitting the signal for danger the group had agreed upon in the wastes. Pausing a moment, he transmits, **"Is Fosso still around. I'd like to ask him some questions about the power relay conduits. You have got see the way these are laid out. You will not believe this.

**Mos Eisley - Fossos place - Considering how good the bait smells.**
Tar'ja started to draw Naryen away from the negotiation between the two males, that is until Fosso changed gears.
Naryen guesses that Fossos thinks that he's losing control of the situation as he looked over the group then to the cart then the hanger door. ***What about the door? Just the fees or is it a trap?*** What he says next confirms it, with no small amount of bravado. "Fosso be needing an answer or Fosso be canceling the deal. Find another ship for such a good deal ..." then with a laugh "Fosso be thinking not in these parts."
Chases banter was customarily positional and Tar'jas challenging and Naryen was content to leave them to it until Kasga called the group. "Is Fosso still around. I'd like to ask him some questions about the power relay conduits. You have got see the way these are laid out. You will not believe this. Can you bring him in here?"
So there is something for her to address! **"It's too bad you don't know where SBC is since he is our credit source. Now then, the ship hasn't been sabotaged has it Fosso?"**

Fosso lets out a snort of protest at Chases comment about being a backwater farm boy. The merchant quickly smiles as the young jedi begins to see Fosso`s reasoning. "Fosso be knowing you where peoples of integrity, Fosso be taking that deal."
Chase comms the droid again, this time Fosso flys to the cart and begins scanning over the contents. "Ah many crates, yous doing a good haul yes." The merchant is speaking to himself as much as he is speaking to anyone who would respond.
(For Dexter and Kasgas eyes only)
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Just before Kasga pulls out his comm, Chases voice again seems to come from the inert droid. "Boss it looks like I'll have to trade most of the supplies along with the cart and beast for the docking fees Fosso says we still owe."
Dexter begins to look over the ships systems, all of which are ready and in good working order. Life support, sublight engines, landing assembly, armor, Dexter scans through the list everything passing the warm up testing.
The ship is still missing shields weapons and a Hdrive. In the middle of the engine room SBC remains motionless on the floor. Satisfied with the systems check the Bothan looks around for anything else out of place, with a smile the engine room seems in working order.

</details>

The Toydarian ignores Tar`ja`s comments instead rummaging through the carts contents. When Kasga`s voice comes through the com and announces "Is Fosso still around. I'd like to ask him some questions about the power relay conduits. You have got see the way these are laid out. You will not believe this. Can you bring him in here?" Fosso pauses.
Trunning sharply at Deidra`s comments, "Fosso no Sabotage! Fosso been working that ship some time now, Fosso be giving a good deals today." Upset the merchant floats down from the cart looking at Chase as he moves. "Fosso be thinking yous unload the cart, yours friends give Fosso bads company." The Toydarin hurry's towards the door intent on leaving your group alone with the ship.

Bad company....she'd give him bad company. no...no...relax...she couldn't kill him...yet.
All the same they still needed him to get off the hell-hole of a planet and the best way to do that would be to keep shut and go with the flow of things..especial when she wasn't sure her temper was in check.
Moving her hand away from her blaster she glances to the other two, inclining her head slightly to that submissive posture the other woman had as some form of apologies.
Looking to the Jedi she sighs "I think I will see what it is that's so fascinating they have found." She looks to the flying merchant next "perhaps you will be so good and kind of a businessman as to humor them and us before we unload the cart for you." She offers an incline of her body in a bow of sorts before moving out of the cart and to the ship.
Moving to the ramp she enters and looks about "Dex! Kasga!" she calls out taking a hallway to find them, what could possibly be so damn amazing.

Chase Was surprised at Fosso's change in attitude from happy 'I'm making credits' to the 'angry storm off' attitude. Not sure what to say to get him to stay short of tackling him as verbal negotiations were always a week spot for him. Though this time it seemed to be going well.
This time it was Deidra who seemed to be taking the road to smooth the winged alien over to keep him from storming off. ***Nice work Deidra. Keep him close in case it goes bad.*** He thought.
he looked at Tar'ja as she turned her blue eyes his way. She was removing her hand from the blaster she carried. He smiled as she looked at him. He thought could sense some struggle with emotions within her. Looking at Fosso he could see why. When his gaze went back to his friend she was back in the submissive posture that Deidra seemed to have perfected. ***That doesn't look right, on either of them. They are both too strong to allow themselves to be treated like that.***  He thought as he gave that smile to Tar'ja.
"I think I will see what it is that's so fascinating they have found. Perhaps you will be so good and kind of a businessman as to humor them and us before we unload the cart for you." She said to Fosso.
Nodding Chase moved to the drivers seat of the cart. **"I'll pull the cart in a little farther to unload it."** He sat down and grabbed the reigns as he began to coax the beast to begin moving. By moving the cart in a little farther he really just wanted to get it closer to the ships loading ramp. He looked at the two as he began moving. ***Smart pair those two.***

"I think Fosso is trying to pull something on us. Wouldn't be the first time someone on this planet has screwed me over. Tell Chase if he isn't busy to put a blaster on Fosso and have the others secure the area. I'll get started on putting in the hyper drive."

**"It just doesn't make sense. Based on what we know of the droid it doesn't seem that it would act this way."**
A moment later his comm opened up, it was Tar'ja. "Chase, Fosso's deactivated SBC what's more he spoke Huttese, he said We're in trouble now. Prepare for a fight, and get what you can loaded we may be making a run for it."
He stopped in mid movement and looked at Deidra. **"Wonderful."** He put the crate on the loading platform and grabbed his comm. **"Understood.

The sound of the lock being closed, and the tone of the fluttering aliens Huttese expression, resonated through her very core. ***Well, that sounds bad.*** The sound of Chase moving knocking the cart around to the ships hatch startled her and she moved to assist with his efforts.
Then Kasga revealed it all to be far worse than she expected. She couldn't understand how someone else could have incapacitated SBC without Fossos knowledge, but it was far to late to do anything about it now.
As she helped unload the cart she spoke to Chase **"Well, it seems the trap has been sprung. Should we cut through the door"** a quick glance towards his energy sword **"and confront Fosso or let whatever comes come and deal with it then?"**
With a flash across her expression she looks to Chase. **"I wonder if the ship is rigged, demolition or stun charges."** Her tone had an unintended but considerable amount of humor to it as she considered how her very short time on this rock had gone thus far.

With some help from Deidra they got the loading platform lowered. During that time Chase listened to Deidra. "Well, it seems the trap has been sprung. Should we cut through the door" He saw her glance to where he kept his lightsaber. "and confront Fosso or let whatever comes come and deal with it then?" He saw the flash of emotion across her face. "I wonder if the ship is rigged, demolition or stun charges." He smiled and chuckled softly at the remark. He wasn't sure if the humor was intended but it was well placed.
He shook his head as he thought about her comment on Fosso. **"I thought about it but what will it gain us? Not much. It will let another person on this dustball know who and what I am. At this point in time the less that know it the better."** He paused for a second. **"In general the more who know about me the worse it is for me and who ever I'm with. Maybe among the Rebels I'll be able to openly carry my lightsaber. Have you seen the holos on this guy named Skywalker? Supposedly he's like me or I'm like him. Maybe he's had more training. Either way I'd like to meet him someday."** He smiled as some of the boyishness in him escaped at that moment. Despite being a Jedi in training. He was human after all.
As he positioned the cart onto the cargo lift Chase felt the beast's protests about its position. **"Easy big fella we're not taking you. I'll cut you loose."** He quickly moved forward and released the beast from its harness freeing it from the cart.
He looked around. It was quiet. With a calming breath he reached out to the Force and felt its comforting effect. He felt the surface emotions of his companions. They were all tired and ready to move. Focusing more he extended his awareness to outside the hanger walls and out to the street. Out there was something odd. He only felt the one mind despite knowing full well that the streets were crowded at this time of day. Chase could tell that the mind was focused and waiting but for what he had no idea. Actually it was very odd. Something wasn't right. A gut feeling or the Force. Either way it was time to get off this planet. Imperial blockade or not.
He looked back at Deidra. **"Lets get out of here. The sooner the better. Someone is outside and I cant figure the person out. It's calm, collected and waiting for something."**
He brought up Tar'ja's comlink. **"How's SBC and that hyperdrive coming along? We.re going to need both to get out of here. SBC has the coordinates on where were going. We're just about ready down here."**

Dex continues working on the hyper drive. He hears everyone talk about restarting the droid. "I can get him up and running if you want but we might need blast our way out and if the ship is without a hyper drive might be difficult." He continues his work installing the hyper drive.

Tar'ja slides down the corridor to the engine room and reveals the Fosso has flown off. Kasga's gut clenches with fear. We are betrayed. He'll bring the Empire down upon us. 
To his surprise, she seems concerned about getting SBC reactivated. Kasga's mouth just gapes at her order. She even turned away after her delivery. He's just going to get in the way and we just don't have time for that. Well, perhaps I'll get to shoot him.

Tar'ja turns back to her com "Dex is taking care of that drive now, Kasga is seeing about getting the droid activated....it might be easier on all of us if you two are able to get inside here something quick, if we have to, we can make a run for it."
She pauses and looks over to the duros, eyeing the droid "We need what information he has, as well as where we're going next" she sighs and rubs her head, moving over to the control for the cockpit and takes a seat. Switching the com to the bothan "how's that drive coming dex?"

He he hurried to get the cart loaded his comm beeped again and he heard Tar'ja's voice. "Dex is taking care of that drive now, Kasga is seeing about getting the droid activated....it might be easier on all of us if you two are able to get inside here something quick, if we have to, we can make a run for it."
He nodded to himself and to Deidra. There were going to have to hurry. **"Understood. We'll ride the cargo lifter up. As long as we have a way out of this hanger we should be good."** When he said the words he looked up from what he was doing. Fosso had closed the door. In fact they may need to open a hanger door to get out. The presence outside bothered him. He'd used the Force quite a bit the last few days. ***Could I have made my presence known? It's not like I had much choice. If I hadn't some or all of us would not be here right now. Question is could my earlier actions have put us in greater danger than before.***

Chase cuts the Dewback loose allowing it to clear the lift. With no where to go it moves to a corner of the hanger and lays down for a much needed rest.
The cart floats over the lift platform cargo in hold. Both Chase and Deirdra stand on the lift as well with Deidra holding the control box. Fosso`s hanger is large enough to hold the ship with some room to spare, measuring 40m by 20m (the ship is 34m by 10m). The hanger has two ground exits the internal side door with leads to Fosso`s scrap yards and the side sliding hanger doors. The roof is an open lift off and landing zone, its walls provide shade to those inside.
Inside the ship Dexter continues with the installation of the H drive. So many distractions it will be at least a few more moments before its installed then a series of tests to ensure its still functioning at peck efficiency. Finally with only a back up drive and one so old the Bothan would have to regulate power slowly to the unit to avoid a burn out on start-up.
Kasga bends down to take a closer look at the droid. The inhibitor looks standard though the droid may have been stunned before the inhibitor was placed. That would account for the droids current offline state. Shrugging his shoulders the Duro`s grabs the inhibitor and pulls, yanking it off the droid.
The droids eyes flash in a series of restart sequences.
Outside the ship the lift is still down Chase having only just secured the repulsor cart. The ships access ramp is also down allowing access inside. Deidra awaits the jedi`s signal to raise the lift.
SBC moves to a sitting position without warning. Its eyes still flashing in a system restart. From inside the ship and outside everyone hears a series of small explosion. Both the sliding hanger doors and side door fly open off there hinges and on to the hanger bay floor.
As the smoke starts to clear storm troopers can be seen at both entrances. Actual numbers are hard to determine at this point at least two at each door, most likely more behind them. SBC blurts out "Fosso no! ... Storm troopers here? ... double crossed!"

Tar'ja sighs at the responce given by the bothan, she knew she needed patients with this but she wanted to leave now before something happened. Lekku twitching with thoughts and plans she eyes the controls before her before...
"Fosso no! ... Storm troopers here? ... double crossed!"
The lilca twi'leks head wiped around to stare at the droid "troopers?!" She looks up to the duros then grabs the com to the jedi and human below "Troopers! We've been double crossed!" she calls into it, shifting to the ship com to speak to the bothan "We need that drive fast Dex!"
She stands and moves to the Duros "We need to help them." She looks around "Does this thing have any weapons on it??"

He runs about halfway down the ramp, trying to make himself a small target and hiding behind the ramp supports.

Chase watched the Dewback walk off away from teh ship where it proceeded to lie down for a much needed rest. The group had put the beast to the test. Fortunatly it performed admirably. With a few adjustments the cargo was firmly secured to the lift where it would spend it time during the journey off this planet, providing Dex got the Hdrive operational.
Looking up at Deidra he was about to give her the sign to raise the lift indicating all was ready to go when two maybe three loud explosions cut him off. Looking left and right through the smoke he spotted Storm Troopers entering through what was once locked doors. **"Karking hell!** He shifted the comlink to his left hand.
Drawing his blaster and ducking for cover that the crates provided he began firing at the advancing troopers. He thought about taking out his lightsaber but that could wait. They were too far for it to be effective. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Kasga decend half way down the ramp take a knee and begin firing. ***What's he doing? He's got to get the ship started up. We're dead if we stay here any longer than we have to. They'll overwhelm us.***
Shifting he weight he yelled into the comlink not for Tar'ja's sake as she would hear him fine but for Kasga. **"I sure hope someone is doing the emergency startup on the ship. They'll over run us if we're not out of here quickly."** He dropped the comlink. The metal cylindrical device clanged off the metal lift and then rolled to the right where it came to a rest against a crate.
A thought came to him and he yelled over thw sounds of battle to Deidra. **"Aren't there some grenades in these crates? Find them."**
He then grumbled to himself as he fired his weapon. **"Someone better be getting this ship started."**

Chase heard his comlink chirp as the Bothans voice came from it. "Chase I am going need time to get this set up. Hold them along as you can." He took a quick sidelong glance at Deidra and spoke with a carefully measured tone despite the battle that had erupted around them.
**"Do you think he realizes that we don't actually need the Hdrive till we're in space? If we don't get there we will have no need for it? Frankly I'm surprised he's lived this long with out getting killed by the Empire…or his friends."**

"Karkking Hell..." she grumbles, shifting back to the pilots seat and sits, running the controls to get power moving through the ship and to the engines, it was time to get going and get going fast.
"I sure hope someone is doing the emergency startup on the ship. They'll over run us if we're not out of here quickly."
Tar'ja hits the com as well, "I'm working on it! get into the ship dammit!" she calls back, tossing the com to the side she refocuses on getting the ship ready for take off. Hitting the com for the ship she calls out again "Dex keep working on that drive, I'm getting us out of this area."

It's then that the sounds coming from inside the ship change slightly. ***Pre-flight!?*** **"Frag me."** she mutters as she changes gears, previously away from the crates of munitions and other volatiles that recently endured a ship crash, and hits the controls for the lift to bring the Chase and herself into the ship. It's then that she hears Tar'ja over the com and echoing down the ships hallways.
***C'mon universe, don't let Varbrindals legacy end like this!*** She thinks about Thomas Lars again and feels a twinge of something unfamiliar that distracts her as she huddles away from the Troopers sights.

Kasga runs for the forward ramp, not sure what he will find outside explosions, stormtroopers who knows what else. Taking position behind one of the ramp lifts Kasga scans the area. Both the hanger double doors and side door have been blown open. The metal doors rest on the hanger floor, smoke clouds the exits most likely a result of the explosion. As the smoke clears the Duros notices a pair of storm troopers at each entrance.
Tar`ja flips a few power switches in the engine room starting the power up sequence. Then running out she heads for the cockpit to complete the process. Passing the ramp she can see Kasga taking a firing position, but from inside the ship the Twi`lek can see little else.
The former imperial officer recognizes the tactics, shock and blitz. So many times in training had she studied such simple yet effective tactics, and more then once ordered its execution. Troopers blow an entrance then swarm inside. Taking cover Deidra fails to find comfort behind the ramps lift strut. Is this how her enemies , victims felt? Deidra then hits the controls for the lift, slowly it begins to close.
Chase draws his blaster, shouting out orders the young jedi takes aim at the closest storm trooper. Letting a blast lose towards the side door Chase holds steady aim on the lead storm trooper hitting the white armored soldier in the chest. Scorn by the blaster shoot the armor does little to save the trooper. The imperial trooper falls face first to the hanger floor.
Dexter shakes his head trying to focus on the task at hand. OK no problem install the H drive, do it before the ship is over run easy right? The Bothans eyes widen as the ships engine begins to power on. Umm ok then install the H drive, do it before the ship is over run, and don`t electrocute yourself. I can do this, I have to do this.
With one trooper down another takes his place. On both sides the advance troopers start to move in, rifle blasts leading the way. The troopers manage to lay a spread of fire across the ships hull.
From both door ways more troopers move in. Two on each side start to assemble tri-pods, while more line up to storm the hanger.

"*Ok no pressure here. None at all.*" He thinks to himself as the power switches are thrown. "*Remember your training and you will get through this. You didn't score high on the tests for nothing.* " Dex's mind goes back to his happier days in the Academy. Teachers and instructors drilling over and over to him that focus was key in these situations. He thought back then that his life would be easy and less danger filled. He was good at what he did but even he had his limits. Bit he had to do this to save is friends and get them off this rock alive. He would not let them down. Even if they wanted to shot him most of the time.

Chase saw his shot take the lead trooper in the chest leaving a scorching hole the even the white armor couldn't deflect. To the side and left the trooper fell. Despite the fallen body another trooper quickly took it's place. Looking around he saw even more troopers flooding into the hanger. The situation was bad...very bad. They were going to be overrun and soon. His heart hopes lifted when he heard the ship engines begin to start. The feeling was short lived as he spotted the two teams begin to set up the tri-pods. ***E-webs. Now we're really screwed.*** He thought to himself despite that the cargo lift was now moving upward into the ship.
**"E-webs!"** He yelled out as the new threat was being brought forth. Not only would the heavy repeater make quick work of them it also would damage the ship.
**"We're really running short on time we need to get moving now!** He changed his aim this time bringing the heavy weapon crew under his sites looking to take another down before they were inside the ship.
***Come on Tar'ja. You get us off the ground I'll owe you the best dinner and night out I can give you. It may not be much but it'll be something.*** . He thought to himself
as the ships engines turned up even more.

Kasga heard Chase yell from under the ship. Turning to the left, he focuses his fire on the troopers actually setting up the heavy blasters. More will just take their place, but I can slow them down some. Lining up his shot, he double-taps the firing stud on his blaster rifle, trying for a couple quickshots and a kill.
Engines are coming up. Dex was still in engineering. I don't have him figured for a pilot. Deirdra and Chase are on the lift, that leaves Tar'ja. Not who I expected. Ok, it sounds like she's got the preflight sequence right. Wonder what other tricks…hmmm…secrets she's got hidden away?

Tar'ja looked to the controls, with preflight finishing she takes the controls in hand and sets to getting into the air, she'd fly low until that lift was inside and the others safe but for now, they'd be better off getting up and out of there.
Thank the stars for the open roof.
Shifting engines to lift, she heads for the only open area without troopers, flipping the switch for the landing gear to be put away while she makes the way for higher altitude to get out of the line of fire. She'd have to be careful though, just until the lifts were away.

Inside the ship Dexter continues to work on the H drive. Pulling his hand back quickly to avoid an electrical surge. Sighing the Bothan realizes it will take a few more moments to install the H drive.
Chase shouts out warnings of E-webs as he fires another shoot off. The lift continues to close as the jedi fires, The shoot goes wide hitting the hanger wall to the side of the door.
Kasga squeezes off a few shoots, the twin blast scream across the room towards their target. Hitting one of the storm troopers the soldier drops the piece of equipment he was assembling before dropping to the floor.
Tar`ja`s quick thinking got the ship powered up and ready for flight. Pulling on the controls she gently lifts the ship out of the hanger. Storm troopers begin to rain a hail of balster bolts on the ship as it gets away.
Inside the engine room SBC finishes its reboot. "Fosso is an imperial sympathizer, we must escape." To no one in particular.
Dexter being the only one inside the engine rooms reply's "We know we know, catch up with the current situation and help me install the H drive." Obviously not a mechanic the droid begins to pass random tools to the Bothan.
From the ramp Kasga can see more troopers outside Fosso`s hanger, many more. As the ship rises over the hanger bay the other storm troopers open fire on the ship. The sound of bolts hitting the ships hull assaults the Duro`s senses. Scrambling up the ramp Kasga close the ramp and races for the cockpit.
Deidra smiles as she realizes the local Tie wing they had all recently witnessed where configured for ground assault. If they where sent after her group they would have limited if any ship to ship combat abilities. If luck was ob their side the wing would have to refit before they could give pursuit. This means that their only real threat would be any destroyers in orbit.
Kasga enters the cockpit just as Chase and Deidra enter. The lower side cockpit give a wide view of the city below. The cockpit view ports extend through much of the lower-side cockpit giving the area a feeling of being suspended.
"Tar`ja I can take the controls from here, you take co-pilot please." Kasga and Tar`ja change seats. The Duros frowns at the controls, the ship is sluggish to respond slow to accelerate and defenseless. The pilot forces the ship to gain speed as fast as possible.
Breaking through the planets atmosphere everyone in the cockpit breaths a sigh of relief. Even with Tatooine behind you the positioning and placement of view ports inside the cockpit gives a very wide angle of view over the area, including the planet.
Inside the engine room Dexter continues with the installation. So far so good. almost done. SBC stays to assist voicing concern about time frames "We must exit this system as soon as possible, please install the device with more haste."
"I`m trying I`m trying, stop talking and pass me that hydro spanner." The Bothan pushes hard on the drive forcing it into place, then continues to attach every conduit the the H drive casing.
The cockpits sigh of relief is cut short at the sight of the triangular shadow closing in from behind. The ships sensors burst out alarms warning of the obvious. A triangular shadow can mean only one thing. No words are needed everyone jumps to their tasks.
Kasga pushes the ship forward, while Tar`ja monitors the ships systems. Deidra begins running through some simple sensor routines in an attempt to confuse the Illustrious`s sensors. Its a desperate act but the former imperial barely survived the last encounter with this star destroyer.
As if on queue Ties scream in then past your groups ship. The ship jolts as it take a hit from one of the Tie`s. Inside the engine room Dexter curses as the jolt almost dislodges the H drive from its casing.
The Tie`s make a wide turn circling back to make another pass at the cargo ship. Behind the destroyer`s engines push hard trying to close into firing range. Fearing for the worst Chase rushes to the ramp in case of a boarding.
With the Tie`s turning in for the kill Dexter finishes the installation opening the internal ships com "Its installed, but not tested."
Kasaga looks over Tar`ja`s jump cor ordinates and nods, "no better time then now to test it." The ship accelerates into hyper space. The sudden jump in speed catches the Ties off guard as the fire on the ships last position.
The stars stream by into a blur as the cargo ship races away. With a quick jump the ship comes out of hyper space on the other side of the system. Knowing that the Illustrious would be tracking the ship Tar`ja and Diedra plots another jump. By the third jump SBC give the ships computers the final destination. "These coordinates will take us to my employer. We will be safe there. I am sure all of your questions will be answered once we arrive."
Looking over the coordinates you realize with the back up hyper drive the ship has it will take at least a week to make the journey. The destination is the Tovack system, according the the ships computer an uninhabited system in the outer rim littered with gass giants and asteroids. The system is not far from the Roon system well inside the outer rim territories prime grounds when one is looking to evade the empire.

Chase saw his shot go wide as the lift was closing. He could hear the engines come online as more troopers entered the hanger bay. **"We're cutting this close, way to close."** He said to Deidra, his partner on the lift.
He left the ship lift off as the lift finally closed shielding them from the blaster fire outside. He could hear the muffled impacts they made on the durasteel hull of the freighter.
He picked up his comm and looked at Deidra. **"I hate to say it but I was worried there for a moment."**
Not wasting any time he made his way forward to the cockpit. He and Deidra arrived the same time Kasga did. **"Some party they are throwing for us."** He said dryly Trying to ease his own tension at almost being over run on the ground. Despite his Jedi training he was having a hard time controlling his emotions. They were as close to running wild as they ever been. As he looked out of the cockpit to see the expanse of city below he began to run through his calming technique. He saw Kasga and Tar'ja exchange places and his efforts finally began to work at slowing sown his racing heart.
As they broke though the atmosphere Chase relaxed a bit as he placed a hand on Tar'ja's shoulder and gave it a squeeze. His relief was cut short as they all saw the shape of the Star Destroyer fall across the screen. **"Star Destroyer."** He said to no one in particular as they all knew what the blip on the screen meant.
The next few moments were harrowing. With one pass from the Tie's and them making a wide turn for another. He looked at the screen again and saw that the capital ship was closing. He reached out again and placed his hand on Tar'ja's shoulder, giving it a quick pat. He took out his lightsaber with his other hand. **"I'm going back to the cargo hatch. If they do managed to board us it won't be without a fight."** His voice held an edge to it that wasn't hard to miss.
He passed by Dexter and SBC as they were working and he heard Dex call up saying that it was installed as he took up his place near the docking hatch. A moment later he felt the ship lurch as it entered hyperspace. He closed his eyes and simply smiled as familiar feeling of a ship in hyerspace was brought to his senses. **"Nice work Dex!"** he said from where he stood.
A few moments later they were all in the cockpit as SBC gave the final coordinates for their destination. "These coordinates will take us to my employer. We will be safe there. I am sure all of your questions will be answered once we arrive."
He looked at the droid and nodded. **"Lets hope some of them can be answered before we arrive there. I'm sure we all have questions for you and that you have some for us."** He looked at the others. **"I do know a few things for certain. I'm tired and dirty. I think I have sand in some places that I didn't know existed.**

Tar'ja glances back as Kasga and the others entered the cockpit, changing seats with him wasn't enough to make the tension fall from her though the feel of Chase's hand to her shoulder did elevate a bit of the tension while adding some new ones.
No time for that though, the blip on the screen was enough to bring all the tension back again, as the three of them worked hard to get away, clutching the concil at the first hit she turns back to the screen "it's gaining." she announces to the others, they needed to know things were getting worse before they were getting better.
At Dex's call of the instalation her fingers were already instilling a hyper point and they were off; the familier setting of warping stars around them a comfort. She was starting to relax again, instilling a new point and jumping again before SBC set in the last for their final jump. Now...finally, she leaned back in relief. They were off the planet, and they were safe..for now, but still safe. Thank the stars.
"Lets hope some of them can be answered before we arrive there. I'm sure we all have questions for you and that you have some for us." She looked back to him "I do know a few things for certain. I'm tired and dirty. I think I have sand in some places that I didn't know existed."
She smirks faintly, a tiredness in her eyes "I will agree with you there, a long awaited trip to the refresher will be welcomed." She looks to the others around she and Kasga in the cockpit "I feel perhaps now it might be best to get out what secrets we all might hold or things others should know if we are to make a good and complete team."
Her lekku twitch as she stands "I killed my 'family'." she says simply as though stating how the weather was that day. She moves forward "Kasga if you don't mind I'd like to clean up a bit before I relieve you to do the same." She looks back to the two humans "Pardon me. I'm...glad to have that out in the open now." She offers another smirk, apparently aside from the one only used for the Jedi it was the only form of smile she knew, though by posture the intention may have been one of relaxation and ease..if not pride.
What a family had done to warrent a death at the hands of a 'daughter' was anyones guess, or they could ask.

Tar'ja echoed his statement of cleaning up and that they were now off the planet that it may also be a good time to get thigs out in the open.
***I wonder what secrets that she could have that would change things? We all lived lives before we came together.***
I wasn't a second after that he completed his thought that she gave them her "secret".
"I killed my 'family'." She said matter of factly. Chase just stood there. his expression not changing. He wasn't sure that he could have changed it as the confession was so out of thin air that it shocked him so. Through the Force he could sense a feeling of, he wasn't sure, but a feeling of relaxation now that it was out. As if she had nothing to hide now that they accepted her for what she was and had done in the past. He couldn't tell if there was still anger there as she mentioned it but it didn't seem like it as she mentioned it so casually that it was a long ago past.
He kept his face neutral. At least as neutral as he could. There was more to the story he was sure. What the story was he didn't know but he wanted to. He had to know. His feelings for her warrented it. To know why she did what she did. One simply didn't kill on a whim, especially family.
She had excused herself to go clean up and that she would be back to relieve Kasga. Though before she left Chase caught her eye. **"Tar'ja."** He said quietly though loud enough for all to hear in the cockpit. **"Like I said before back at the Jawa trading place, I'd like to hear your story if your willing to tell it.** He remembered the kiss thay shared there under the tarp that covered the cart. He smiled a bit giving her that same smile he had given her before. **"To be honest I think we all have some sort of story as to how we all finally ended up back on that dustball of a planet."** He said as he looked at Deidra with her former Imperial service. Kasga with his flight and combat experience. Dex with his Bothan spy training. Even SBC the droid that was much more than it seemed.
**"How about we all clean up and meet in the common area? It's going ot be a long trip. We might as well get to know each other better."**

### **galenbd** (2010-06-02 16:29:36)

Kasga was still on the ramp when Tar'ja got the ship into the air.Good work. I'm going to need help in a few.  Sealing the hull, he runs for the cockpit. Settling in next to Tar'ja, he says, **"Tar`ja I can take the controls from here, you take co-pilot please."**
They make the run past the Star Destroyer thanks to a trick up Deidra's sleeve. The TIEs come flying in. He sets the ship into a jinking pattern. It's an almost futile gesture. This thing is such a tub.
Keeping an eye on the sensors, he watches the TIEs line up crossfire on the ship. Kasga looks over Tar`ja`s jump corrodinates and nods, **"no better time then now to test it."** He kicks the ship into hyperspace making a microjump across the system.
SBC coordinates several other microjumps before making a final jump to a Rebellion rendevous. Kasga breathes a sigh of relief and settles back into the cockpit chair.
The droid had some reassurances about questions. Kasga smirks in doubt. Then Tar'ja mentions secrets. Some secrets are more of a liability and others. Oblivious to this fact, she reveals some shocking family history. Kasga turns around and looks at her more directly. She seems so matter-of-fact about it as she walks off to the 'fresher. Shaking his head, Kasga sets up a couple of alerts on the system and heads for the common area.

After finishing the install. Dex takes a moment to slump to the floor in the engine room and relax. He can't take long cause might be more adjustment that need to be done. All in all things went sort of well. He was alive and his friends where alive as well. There was that bothersome droid that had got them in this mess, at least he was off that dust ball and head galaxy knows where. (*"Well I guess that my life will stay interesting."* He thinks to himself.
Getting up from the floor he strays putting away his tools and checking over the read outs and checking power levels. *"Need to check the supply to make sure we have plenty to eat. Would want to starve to death after all we have been trough."* He thinks to himself again. Activateting the ships internal comms. "Well I guess we are away and still alive. You can thank me later by the way. Anyway so where we headed? I hope it is some place nice."
(Mechcanics check + 15 to check the read outs.)

**The cold vacuum of space. - Another Trap?.**
After a few sensor tricks, that she didn't expect to work, Naryen finds herself in hyper space with a group of people that a month ago she would have been ordering interrogations for if they had found themselves in her custody as an Imperial Officer. A firefight both on the surface of Tatooine and in orbit and they were off to meet SBCs, and theirs it seems, employer.
She looks to Kasga, with much relief, **"Good job,"** then to everyone **"to us all, since we still live."** a smile shows appreciation to each person present, then a glance to the floor as she considers she'd have died several times without the efforts from everyone present.
***Except the data terminal with legs!***
Tar'ja, perhaps still feeling the effects of the fight/flight response they've all been subjected to for the past few days, mentions that she had killed some people she named "family", likely earning her freedom in the process by the sounds of it. At first Naryen thought the term was being used to describe a criminal organization, but then the Twi'leks tone fully registered. ***No, that's related to her species indentured servitude tradition, I think.*** Naryen considers much of her Xenosociology coursework may have been propganda. ***She was theirs and they violated the terms of her lease arrangement, perhaps?***
It suddenly occurs to Naryen, if she was right, how remarkably similar her background is to Tar'jas. Both betrayed by the people that should have been their salvation. Instead of a place where they can be incubated, to then step out on their own, they were part of something that kept them down from which they needed to escape. Naryen found herself smiling a little at her companion, though she tried to hide it almost immediately. ***Too early for either of us to let new people in, I think.***
At Chases suggestion of conference, she nods her agreement and turns to the droid among them. **"SBC can go first and start with how he didn't see Fossos actions coming, as an *embedded* agent."** she wears the sarcastic smirk plainly, for a moment then changes gears, with a gesture to dismiss any response from the droid. **"However, I think I'd like to get cleaned up first."** She looks to Tar'ja as she considers yet another difference of this group. Having familiarized herself with the ships layout earlier she motions in the direction of the fresher and looks to Tar'ja **"I think we should use it first before the men stink it up."**
With a blank look to Chase she then walks towards where she can get the grit scrubbed from her features. Dexters voice, from the com, almost makes Naryen burst out laughing. In a voice rich with suppressed laughter she moves quickly to the com and answers back **"We can compare bounties later. Great job and all that but did you happen to find any food?"** releasing the com she turns back. **"That meeting would go better with something to eat, I'm starved!"**
Another look to Chase, this one not so blank, and she steps out of the bridge.

Tar'ja takes pause beside the Jedi, offering that smile that was his in a smaller state "I will tell it...I'm not ashamed of what I did." she says softly to him, as it was him that had expressed the interest. A brief movement caught her eye, pale blue turning to the woman in time to catch the smile falling.
Smiling? perhaps she understood what she had meant by 'family'? or had she been through the same? The twi'lek eyes the woman again, perhaps they were not so different aside from race.
"I think we should use it first before the men stink it up." the woman spoke; and the twi'lek had to agree with a smirk and laugh "I agree, let's hurry before they try to beat us to it." Moving to her side, after her brief chat with the Bothan in the engine room, and follows her out and to the fresher.
"Seems by your response perhaps we are not so different?" her stomach growled lowly, she too was hungry and hoped for everyone's sake there was food on the ship, a dead crew wasn't exactly helpful to the rebellion.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2010-06-03 12:39:58)

Chase was able to sense the reaction of the others about Tar'ja's statement about her 'family'. Questioning, uncertainty, understanding maybe. At least there was nothing condemning at the moment.
Deidra nodded at his suggestion about sitting down after cleaning up. "SBC can go first and start with how he didn't see Fosso's actions coming, as an embedded agent." The smirk wasn't lost on the Jedi and that was also tickling the back of his mind. Though to be honest they didn't see it either. The former Imperial echoed the idea of getting cleaned up first. "I think we should use it first before the men stink it up."
**"Nice."**Chase said as he smiled and looked at the shorter woman but all he got in return was a blank stare. It was one he couldn't read and he wasn't sure he wanted to.
Dex's comm brought forth a smile from him and laughter from Deidra. When she was ready to hit the refresher she began to leave. Again she looked at him. This time the stare wasn't so blank. Quickly she stepped off the bridge.
He watched the two go. His eyes fell on Tar'ja as she walked away. He was reminded of the kiss they shared and wondered what would become of it now that they were off the planet. Shaking the thought from his mind he sat down as Kasga stood up and went off to the common room. Looking at the controls the Jedi saw that things had been set up to notify them of any problems. Sighing he stood and followed Kasga to the common area.
**"You coming?"** He said to SBC who was still standing there. As he walked his stomach growled and his thoughts echoed the women. Food.
He looked at Dex and Kasga and spoke loud enough for Tar'ja and Deidra to hear. **"Lets find the food before the women do. This way we'll be assured to get some."** He said smiling as he found the galley and started looking around. He was in a good mood and it showed. they all had been though a lot together. The Force had brought them all here. For what reason he wasn't sure but who was he to question it at the moment.

After hearing the responses back. " Thank you my dear. We aim to please. As far as the food goes I was just wondering that myself. As soon as I done here I will take a look." Dex continues doing his checks. "And as far as I can tell everything is going well down here. Everything checks out so far. We any closer to where we are headed?"

**The cold vacuum of space. - Another Trap?.**
Naryen chuckled at Dexters response and gestured to Kasga to answer him, since the exact transit time was something she wasn't aware of, yet, and she walked out with Tar'ja. Chases voice, pitched to carry, reached her with ease as the pair walked down the corridor. ***Hungry as I am I'd rather be cleaner than this when I eat, given the choice.* "There'd better be some left for us!"** she called back. A smile remained on her face at the banter she just engaged in. ***How many times, something similar, but never feeling like that!*** She pondered that for a moment.
She looked to Tar'ja, as the walked together, and considered the possibilities to her subtle question. **"Trusting others to be there for us only to be let down and even taken advantage of? If I understand you right."** She sighed a little. **"'Pride of the New Order' they said. More like a mark to be exploited!"** she looked back to her companion. **"Not so different?" *In the same sector?***

Tar'ja hums softly in understanding, nodding lightly "Pride of the New Order...Imperials.." she eyes the woman again "people brought in to believe that what was going on was right and good when in the end they mark those trying to escape as traitors and radicals."
She walks silently for a moment to pause by the fresher "And then they turn on their own." she eyes the woman again "Taught what was needed, given what was needed to continued survival but a slave in all senses." She sighs "and everyone else knows the truth but can't tell you without the possibility of retaliation from those you call family." A hardness enters her eyes "until you see for yourself how blind you were to the world."
She's quiet again, her posture hunching slightly, though it seemed she was too lost in her thoughts to realize that she was dipping back into a servitude form. Perhaps it was memories again, it had to be, the coldness that entered her eyes and the bunching of muscles..the rage that filled her.
A deep breath was taken, eyes closing as it all faded away; she stood straight again. Pride, a free posture, and looks to the woman "Sorry. They still haunt me on occasion." She offers a vague smirk that shifts slowly into some form of odd half smile attempt to something more...friendly. "Shall we get clean before they eat everything?" She grins, a bit easier, and steps inside.

Chase rummaged around the galley looking to see what food stores were aboard. If there weren't any they were going to have to make a different port before they arrived at SBC's coordinates.
As he looked around he got a whiff of himself. Days on end of baking and sweating brutal desert sun was not appealing. Without the hot desert wind to keep the air moving the stink was permeating the galley. **"Oh this is bad. I hope they don't take too long."** He said to no one in particular.
He managed to get together what he could. So whom ever came into the galley could take what they wanted. He walked out of the galley to the common room and sat down across from Kasga. He wasn't sure where Dexter was but figured it he was still in the engine room.
He looked at Kasga. **"Nice work back there. I know it wasn't easy in this tub. Listening to you at the controls I'm guess you're more accustomed to something more maneuverable like a fighter perhaps? None the less you and Dex got us out of that pile of poodoo."**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **galenbd** (2010-06-04 14:11:46)

Settling into a chair in the common area, he says, **"It's bound to be better that dried lizard meat."** He brings up the console to remote monitor the cockpit while they talk.
Deirdra comes through and further appropriates the 'fresher with Tar'ja. As usual, the best time to get a shower is when everyone else is asleep. We should probably discuss a watch schedule before too long. On this bucket of bolts, I wouldn't expect to make it all the way there without a maintanence incident. 
Dex is about done making sure the drive is working. Odd that Dex can install a hyperdrive and really have no idea what it does. Maybe we need to adjust duty stations. Come to think of it, I don't know who else can do on board a ship.
Dex's question drifts up the hall from Engineering, Kasga calls back, **"We're getting closer every second. The question is how you measure it. The distances are astronomical."** He smirks at his physics joke.
Chase joins him in the common room with FOOD. Kasga gets up and heads to the galley himself. He calls back down the hall, **"This ship is just fine when you're not trying to run a blockage. I worked on bulk haulers as well. Every ship has it's purpose. It's when you try and cross them that things get dicey."**
He stacks his plate with food. Until they check the stores, he stays away from foods that when spoiled could make him sick. Tainted food is not better than no food. He brings his plate back in and sits down to eat.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2010-06-04 22:40:05)

Chase listened as Kasga talked about ships. What he said rang true. Unless the ship was designed to do multiple things it was best to stick to what it was good for. You only cross those lines when the situation demanded it. Like the one they were just it.
Chase patted the table. **"Yes she may be a bucket but she got us out of there despite her shortcomings. The Force was with us today."**
He mulled over his food and took a few bites. **"The ship I was on before I ended upon Tatooine was called the *Bloodhawk.* It was a decent cargo ship. We sold it and split the sale among the crew. Long story. Has to do with Dosenna's husband and the Trando slavers we ran from. Our captain gave his life that day so we could all escape. He was a good man. Unlike the XO. I can only hope the Trando's gave him what he deserved."** He put his fork down on the plate. The memory was still there, strong in hid mind.

Listening to his friend talk about ships and how things work on them was interesting. It was nice to have someone to talk to about tech and what not. "That is good Kasga my friend. As long as the place we are heading is nicer then where we were I am fine." Dex's checks over is gear and appearance. He thinks he had brought half the planet with him. "I am a site. Let me know when the fresher Is clear so I can clean up a little. Hard to impress the ladies when you look like a Hutt's backside."

<strong>The cold vacuum of space. - Another Trap?.</strong>
Naryen considers Tar'jas words and how many times military decisions seemed more political than strategic during her time as an officer. Often at the cost of talented minds and that was just the few she was exposed to. How many more were sacrificed for the New Order that she, or anyone else, may never know about? As the Twi'lek continues to speak her voice acts like narration to memories for the past decade as they play back in the former Imperials mind.
***How alike we are, indeed.*** The realization had a profound effect on some of her preconceptions, some that she didn't even know she had before that moment. Even when she thought she was being tolerant... ***Why do others need to be "tolerated"? I've been so blinded!*** A brief flash of shame brings her back.
Naryen looks to her companion, and witnesses what may have been some series of memories arranged and placed in storage, likely cold, in the back of Tar'jas mind. Watching the confident posture return is comforting and bolstering as she realizes how weak she herself feels. ***Your strength is an inspiration.*** A grateful smile is worn plainly on her face, then. ***Thank you for sharing.***
She nods a shy agreement, at the invitation, and follows into the fresher area. **"I may need some help. I've been through swamps and sub-sewers but I don't think I've ever been this dirty."** stepping into the room some grit, now dryer, starts to move places she rather it didn't and grimaces. ***Or this uncomfortable. Ow!*** She considers who was with her, those other times, as she removes her gloves then her hood and goggles from her head. Saying more to herself **"Though I was there with far more people then."** A twinge of loss, in particular of her confidence, of the feeling of something that seemed so solid now seeming like vapor.
As she moves to unfasten her overalls it occurs to her that neither of them had ever experienced anything close to privacy in their respective backgrounds though hers may have been different than Tar'jas. She pauses and asks **"I'm sorry I just realized that privacy may have been something you were never offered by your 'family'. If that's true I wouldn't mind waiting."** Then she recalls the revelation Tar'ja shared with her and the gesture to join her. ***I'm so slow! Did she already consider that and sharing this time with me was part of that invitation?***
Speaking with nervous alacrity **"I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you."** With a sigh of frustration she looks down, embarrassment worn plainly on every feature, and recalls her failures with Thomas Lars. The pain at that loss, of an ally and perhaps even a friend hits hard just then. Nearly muttering, **"I'm not good at this."** she suddenly feels like she doesn't deserve to share the company of someone who endured a rather different, yet likely no less difficult, life but seems to have flourished from it.
A tear moistens her face and she quickly moves to wipe it so as not to insult the stoic person that chose to share some time with her by showing even more weakness. She is quickly reminded of the grit still dried to her face, and the sunburn underneath, as her finger makes it bite into her very sensitive under-eye. Naryen gasps at the searing pain powers through her and she flinches away. Her face is every bit the epitome of misery.

### **zerah** (2010-06-06 13:02:44)

Tar'ja moves into the fresher, the feeling of speaking a bit and sharing a little of her past life was...well...rather invigorating, who knew! She'd been so stoic and closed that the idea that sharing might actually release her had never even crossed her mind. Well not till now at least.
"I may need some help. I've been through swamps and sub-sewers but I don't think I've ever been this dirty." she chuckles there and makes to speak when the other speaks again "Though I was there with far more people then." This confused the twi'lek, had she really been speaking to herself? Her thoughts must have been too slow..or perhaps the confusion on her face when she turned to speak to the woman "I'm sorry I just realized that privacy may have been something you were never offered by your 'family'. If that's true I wouldn't mind waiting."
Privacy? would she have offered to share the fresher if she had wanted that? She had actually thought this might do her good as well as the woman! what was it called? Binding? no..Bonding! that was it! females bonded over things...wasn't this something that could be bonded over?
"I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you." the woman sighs and averts her eyes "I'm not good at this."
Rolling pale blue hues the twi'lek moves over to the woman and promptly flicks her forehead, the hiss of pain not gone unnoticed by the twi'lek from her rubbing of her eyes "Enough Deirdra. You are tired and you are dirty and I'm sure you are starving as much as all of us. You are not a weak individual and if we have gone through similar past lives than you are stronger for it. Stop looking at past as something deeply horrible, come to terms and move on, use it to grow and be strong." she nods and takes the woman's face in her hand gently, looking to the dirt and grime with a frown "warmer water should help to get this off easier I think..." she mumbles softly.
In the time the woman had spoken and gone on and on, in wallowing or something the twi'lek had managed to remove her belt and shoes along with her top, the sooner she got into the water the better, she was hating the feel of sad in odd places and none of them pleasant. She knew that the dirt and grime was sticking to her as well, but she knew better than to pick at it. Nodding at her assessment of the woman she motions to the clothes "are you not going to finish? I don't know about you, but I'd like to get some food before the males finish it all without us." She grins, one of those rare ones that actually show that glimmer of happiness and joy within the eyes, She winks and moves back, removing the rest of her clothes but her hands linger on the collar about her neck.
Fingertips trail along it, her head slightly down as she thinks of things in the past. To one outside her mind, it might look near ritualistic, this inner debate seems to have been repeated numerous times maybe. In the end, some things do not change even with deaths in the past, the hand moves away, and the collar remains in place. Another debate lost, and the time not right. Looking back to the woman she motions to her "ready?" She asks, stepping in with a sigh and simply lets the water flow over her relishing the feel of soon to be cleanliness.

From the many view ports on the ship the outside stars can be seen streaming by a clear indication of the speed you are traveling. All of you are weary from the past few days, tired from the ordeal, and filthy from the endeavor. Inside the common room you group together to discuse the next move. The droid SBC stands motionless monitoring your conversation with its unblinking optical sensors.
Dexter check the readings and notices the destination the Tovack system. With the recent information still on display the destination looks barren to say the least. With the others talking about food and the women talking about cleaning up the Bothan begins to rummage through the ship for anything of use.
Chase joins Dexter n the ship wide search for food. Coming back to the common room when the search is complete the pair manage to find food enough for the voyage, though the term food is used losely. Armfuls of dried roth rations of unknown date sealed in grey ration packaging. With a smile Dexter does manage to produce a half bottle of Corellian ale.
This might be a long trip but for one night at least the ale could make things go much faster. After Tar`ja and Diedra finish cleaning up they return to the mountain pile of rations on the common room table. The ship itself holds up really well its manufacture gives reason for the value of these ships. The course holds steady and he H-drive shows no signs of issues. At this point the trip should run smoothly.

When Dex walked in with a half botle of Corellian Brandy and Chase nearly jumped for joy. **"Dex that will certainly end this day on a good note. Where did you find that?** He took another bite of what barely passed for food and then added. **"We probably should wait for the women to get back. You think?"**
The conversation stalled a bit. He looked over at SBC who just stood there Chase sat there for a moment. **"It'll be interesting to see what he has to say. My Master and I had been looking for a way to meet up with the rebellion but never was able to. We spent most of our time trying to stay ahead of Vader and his enforcers."** He turned his head as he saw the two women enter the common room. He almost wished he hadn't used the word "master" in front of Tar'ja. She knew it wasn't like that. that Master Garet was the Jedi master that was instructing him on the ways of the Force. Yet he still didn't want to dredge up any past memories.
He stood up. **"Since you two are done I'm going to cleanup. There's still enough of what passes for food left. And Dex found some Corellian Brandy. I wont be long."** He said as he passed the two. He turned around when he was passed them a smile on his face. **"Smells like the refresher did a good job on you two. I wont be long. Are you two coming?"** He says to Kasga and Dexter.
Not wasting any time he sheds his weapons and clothes and steps into the refresher. The water started out cold. reminding what one of the other crew members on the *Bloodhawk* had said about a 'navy shower'. The water warmed quickly and it started to quickly remove the dried and sweat crusted sand from his body. **"Man I needed this."** He said as he to no one in particular as the sand quickly pooled at his feet. ***If I ever go back to that planet again it will be too soon. Finally I'm on my way to the Rebellion. It's been a long time coming. I may not be with master Garet but at least I'm with people I can call friends.*** He thought about Tar'ja and the lilac color of her skin. ***And maybe one that might become more than a friend.*** At the thought of Tar'ja he turned the water to the coldest setting.
------------
Chase walked back into the common area about 20 minutes later all cleaned up with his hair still slightly wet. It had grown a bit in the last few months and there was actually enough to brush his blond hair to one side. To him it looked a bit odd as he was used to keeping it short.
Seeing the others gathered around he looked for a spot to sit and he saw one he wanted. He walked over and sat next to Tar'ja. What he really wanted to do was to just get a chance to talk with her some more. The kiss they shared opened a door for them but would they walk through it given the chance.
He looked at SBC to get his mind off that subject. That subject would come about again when the time warranted it. **"Has SBC said anything yet?"** He said as he jerked his thumb in the droids direction.

Dex smiles. "Found it stashed some place. Figured a drink was in order beings the ordeal we went through. Now if we can just find some glasses." Dex looks around the common room for anything. Cup, glass anything that might work. " Did I ever tell you what had happen to me before I ran into you very charming people?" Dex smiles to himself remembering what had happened at the casino with the Crimelord and his goons.

At Dexter's comment, he shrugs, **"Not sure about Tovack. Never been there yet. Hopefully, it's not a populated system. It'll be easier to tell if the Empire followed us without a lot of traffic to scan through."**
Finally Dexter comes into the common area and with a bottle of Corellian ale. Kasga had long since lost the funds needed to afford that sort of luxury. **"After the day we've had that'll really hit the spot."**
The two ladies return looking cleanly disheveled. Kasga is relieved to see some of the fear and tension gone from Deirdra's face. Chase heads for the 'fresher and Kasga gets up quickly to join him. Recognizing that he'll have time later for a more relaxing shower, Kasga moves through his quickly, but a bit messily. Eight minutes later, he returns to the common area, a bit cleaner.
Chase comes in shortly and asks about SBC. Kasga purses his lips sardonicly. **"Not yet. I can't wait to hear this one."**

### **ganthet** (2010-06-09 11:05:39)

"That will be good to not be chased by stromtroopers for awhile." He says to Chase offering him a glass and some of the ale. "Last time I had any of this was the last time I thought I was happy. Before I ment up with you guys I ran a foul of a Crimelord. I was trying to releave him of his Ill gotten credits when I was betrayed by the fairer sex." Dex smiles at the memories. "Ah those where the days. The credits, the women the ale and whiskey flowed, until I was caught." Dex fur raises at the thought of the fight and getting his friend out of there in one piece. "Would have never made it out of there if that air battle had broken out and the Tie hadn't chased into the Casino. That was a bit of luck on my side."
As the line to the fresher shortens. Dex takes his turn and cleans himself up and returns to the common room. "Ah that is better. I think I brought half that planet with me." taking an empty seat he finishes off his glass of ale and relaxes."So my friends how did you all come to be here in the employ of our droid friend and headed to another forsaken world to be eaten or shot at by lord knows what?"

A fine line is being walked here by yours truly and you guys moved ahead a bit! )))
Naryen continued to disrobe but was slowed greatly as she was mostly watching Tar'ja remove her clothing without much care to being witnessed. Hints of accented muscle lines, perhaps the occasion scar, kept her eyes roaming as she took in the figure and it's motions. A notable pause, something thoughtful at least but perhaps even intimate, when it came to a collar that remained. The human found that particular gap in her knowledge frustrating. Naryen found herself watching her ... friend intently enough that it caused the former Imperial to blush when it occurred to her. ***A mark of ownership? Then why does she seem to still consider herself someones property? Rite of passage incomplete then?***
Realizing she was distracting herself with that line of thought she found herself looking into a pair of eyes not so dissimilar to her own. With a smile that left no feature untouched, and a wink, and a gesture that was unmistakable in it's meaning the purple woman entered the refresher unit. Though nearly lost in the sunburned face, the rest of her pale and slender form betrayed her emotions rather plainly.
After brief scramble with a few remaining buckles, and other garments, and placing their closes in an automated processor, an awkward and light pink human stepped in behind her naked save for a clear difference in comfort level drawn around herself. Looking down at herself she saw the blush, and then watched it deepen upon realizing it. ***Great.***
As Tar'ja let the grit and sand soak through, letting the water flow and clean the most upper layers, she glanced over her shoulder. The skin tone seemed different, perhaps the water was too warm? She did recall this diminutive package of a person having hailed from a colder world. A look at her expression, however, finally registered Deidras body language. ***Oh for…!*** When she rolled her eyes she did notice that the refresher station had drawers.
An idea started to bloom and she checked. One was fully stocked with cloths, another with lotions some of which she recognized and others she didn't. ***Fosso…?*** She withdrew one she knew and spritzed a cloth which she handed back to Deidra. **"Here, start between my shoulders."** she considered, again the nervous posture. With a soft and reassuring voice, that she suspected some might use for a child **"Slowly."**
Naryen, once again, saw a roll of the eyes from over Tar'jas shoulder and she looked away feeling rather embarrassed. When she looked back she was being handed a cloth. The amusement in the eyes and the tone seemed clear. Taking the offered cloth Naryen started wiping down the other womans back as instructed and adding a softer touch until there was no grit to hazard the skin. From there with slow attentions to dirt and grime, in more places than Naryen had even realized, she found the herself, having focused on the task and the connection with her peer, enjoying herself. Soon her nervousness passed and she started to relax, much to her own amazement.
Tar'jas patience with her payed dividends and hands from either sometimes lingered on the other as the helped clean more than just planetary remnants wash from each other. Muscles that were far more sore than Naryen would have expected, relaxed thanks to no small amount of tender attentions from an apparently rather skilled set of hands. She made every effort to return the favor to her generous companion.
After a pat dry and application of some skin conditioner they took their time to clothe themselves. Naryen paused, while dressing, and looked to Tar'ja. **"Thank you."** her tone conveyed an intimacy she hadn't realized she felt until she heard her own voice. With a more controlled tone but still with plenty of calm sincerity. **"We should do something like this again sometime."** a thoughtful look then with a full smile **"Hopefully with less planet on us!"** she found herself laughing at the thought of what other messes they might help each other out of. **"Perhaps swamps and bugs next?"**
They walked to the common room, noticeably more comfortable in each others company, eager to see what food is available. Smiles on their faces, and shared with glances, they found the consumables made up for, sort-of, in quantity what they clearly lacked in quality. Once again the two women found they had something in common as they helped themselves to food they found quite palatable and familiar. **"Better than some I've had."**
After some greetings and banter Naryen looked to the others to answer Dexters question first as it elicited memories she didn't want to lead with. A glance to Tar'ja confirmed that these may be people she could trust and her name, and background, may come up in this conversation. It may even wait to the end, though Chase and Kasgas inquiry of SBC got her attention and she looked to the droid with a histrionically raised eyebrow. ***Well?***

Tar'ja was all chuckles and smirks within the fresher, the woman was such a nervous wreck it was a wonder she was able to remember how to walk at times...But the knowledge that this woman and herself might have things more in common was something she needed to cling to. She didn't want to cling to it, she didn't want to cling at all but some part of her latched to it.
Cloths exchanged, she took the time to wash the others back, ensuring she got the dirt and grime off of the light colored skin while pushing and massaging at the muscles she found too tense, something must have worked as the other had begun to return the favor and relax; it made her smile, how strange...was this than a real friend? a true one?
Moving out of the fresher and using a bit of the strange lotion the other had used for her own skin, how soft it made it!, the two dressed and exited, walking a bit closer to each other than perhaps they would have before, a sure sign that things were changing, and...if she was honest with herself she didn't mind it.
Glancing to the Jedi as he passes by she gives him his smile, turning to watch him with a wink, they had a week. together.
Moving to the table she takes up a seat beside her new...friend? strange to call someone that.. All the same she takes what was supposed to pass for food and raises a brow at the woman, it was better than what she'd had before, and probably better than what the other had, had at some point. Chuckling she eats slowly, listening to the two males talk before the rush off for their own turns at the fresher.
Looking to the ale the Twi'lek frowns but pours herself a bit "it's not whiskey.." she takes a sip and sets it down nodding "but it hits the spot." She chuckles faintly and leans back into her seat, looking up as the Jedi returns, her body not responding much physically but her eyes brightened at the sight of him, her heart leaping as he takes a seat beside her.
They were all safe now..she could afford to show a bit more emotion...shifting slightly she rests her head against the Jedi's shoulder and neck, sighing against his skin, it was could to be safe again...even for the short time this might be. At the mention of the droid she looks to SBC expectantly.

As your group cleans up and converges within the common area the droid SBC continues to monitor your actions. Inside the common room sits a large round table with bench seating on one half and retractable stools on the other half. The bench alone could seat you all plus the four retractable stools, they fold into the floor to provide extra room when moving cargo inside the ship. Like all the other rooms he common area has no decoration, its central position in the ship gives it hatchways and doors in all four directions.
Along the ceiling are closed storage containers, this is where Dexter found the food supplies. There is only one computer terminal in the room, it has read outs of all the ships functions.
The ship supports one refresher, two cramped bunk rooms, the cockpit, an engine room and the rest cargo holds. Simple in design the ship is very functional.
As if waiting to be acknowledged SBC head finally moves when Deidra questions the droid. "Well indeed. I congratulate you on your victory today so few are able to coordinate such a feat against the empire." The droid scans your group stopping to look each of you over. "Our destination is Port Eclipse, do not worry about locating it on your star charts it is not there."
SBC moves towards the corridor neatest the cargo hold then stops as if in after thought. "I can answer some of your questions, my employer will answer the rest. I should inspect the cargo before shutting down for a while, the inhibitor has wreaked havoc on my systems."

As he sat next to Tar'ja he relaxed. He recalled the light in her eyes changed when they looked at each other just now. ***Is it that noticeable for me when I look at her.?*** He wasn't sure and at the moment he didn't really care. He was just glad to be off the planet with the others.
His question about SBC was answered by Kasga. And like the Duros, Chase was eager to hear what it had to say. He was about to ask a question when he felt Tar'ja lean into him lightly. Her head tilted till it came to rest on his shoulder and neck. The warmth of her breath sent a shiver down his spine. He simply smiled as he enjoyed the physical contact hoping that it wouldn't end anytime soon.
Any thought he might have been starting to think about were interrupted when SBC spoke. Now that they were all gathered and inquiring about the droid. SBC must have thought that now was a good time to begin.
"Well indeed. I congratulate you on your victory today so few are able to coordinate such a feat against the empire. Our destination is Port Eclipse, do not worry about locating it on your star charts it is not there." It looked them over as it spoke and then began to walk off.
***Is that all it's going to say to us after when we all just went through?***
He was about to say something as the droid stopped and turned before it got to the closest corridor to one of the cargo bays. "I can answer some of your questions, my employer will answer the rest. I should inspect the cargo before shutting down for a while, the inhibitor has wreaked havoc on my systems."
Chase looked at the droid trying to figure out what to say. it also gave the others a chance to fire off a question at the droid. After a few seconds when no one else spoke up Chase cleared his throat. **"I have a question. WE know very little about you yet it seems that you already know quite a bit about us. How?"** Chase looked at Kasga. ***Like how did you know that Kasga was part of the air battle on Tatooine with his brother. It wasn't a mistake that he let it slip in conversation with him when he was trying to get us to work for him.***
He looked back at SBC. **"And how did you end on on that dustball? You don't seem to be a normal droid."**
He felt Tar'ja shift next to him as she leaned in a bit more her head moving up a bit coming closer to his. Her comfort level seemed to be growing. He didn't think that this kind of action was normal for her but he wasn't going to complain. He let own head tilt towards hers a bit letting the bottom of his cheek rest upon the top of her head.

The droid stands motionless looking at Chase as if compiling data on the meaning of his questions. SBC then nods and answers "As for who I am I am SBC-54, I am a human cyborg relations protocol droid." The droid gives a slight bow at that. "My employer knows a lot about you as we have many contacts on Tatooine as well as many other worlds. Kasga`s brother Kirn Hrato and his squad the Reapers where under our employ for sometime. Kirn himself spoke of his younger brother often." SBC motions to Kasga with a wave of its hand. "As for how I ended up on that dust-ball as you call it, I go where my employer needs my services."
Realizing that he had not answered the last question SBC continues. "I have been online for 72,876 days 16 hours, 47 minutes. AS you can imagine that is far beyond the normal service of routine memory wipes many droid owners allow. I have served my employers house for this time frame and have accumulated a vast data base on a variety of alien races."
The droid looks around the room at each member of your group. "Will there be any further question?"

" So we go in blind and having to trust your employer won't turn on us. Been there before." Dexter streches and yawns. "Been along time sense I have rested. Think I will check on the engines then find a quite corner and get some rest." with that Dex gets up and heads to the engine area.

### **Yogi** (2010-06-11 11:13:00)

Chase listened as SBC talked about its contacts on Tatooine and seemingly around the galaxy. An interesting thing that it said was that it had worked for a house. What exactly it meant by a "house" he'd like to know but then it said it had been in service for more than 72 thousand days his head perked up.
**"Seventy-two thousand days? That's…."** He started talking so quickly he needed to give his mind a chance to catch up. **"…what about 200 years depending on several factors. And no memory wipes."** The incredulous look stayed on his face. the thought still running through his mind.
The thought was halted when Dex spoke. He seemed surprised that SBC would have any info on him since he was from the Bothan Spy net. Chase chuckled softly at that. Though it was enough for Tar'ja to feel his body move at the soft burst of expression. ***If he is the typical graduate of the Bothan Spynet the Rebels better find a different spy ring.*** Chase thought to himself. It wasn't that he didn't like Dex. He came though when it mattered but the Bothan was as scattered brained as they came. ***Or maybe he just walks to the beat of a different drummer. Maybe that explains it.*** It was about as thin of an explanation as they came but it was the only one he had at the moment
He was surprised again when he excused himself. Actually he wasn't. It was typical Dex. As the Bothan left and entered the aft section to the engine room Chase shook his head as he watched down the hallway that Dex went down. **"One would think that in his profession he would want to stay and hear as much as he could from the one who could give us answers. Then again this seems to be typical for him. Hopefully its not typical for rest that are like him."** He said to those still gathered in the common room.
Looking back at SBC and then the others he waited to see if anyone else had questions they wanted answered before he asked any more.

Naryen stared incredulously at the droid, as her experiences with this ...agent collected in her mind. The very idea of letting a droid run longer than it's manufacturer instructed cycle was alien enough to Imperial doctrine, but two centuries! **"You are quite a resource, then. Not something to be used in a fungible fashion as I had thought before."** her voice was casual but now it and her posture shifted. ***Not so fast!*** **"What is your 'employers house', as you said, called? To what organization is your 'employers house' affiliated? A certain planetary government? Consortium? Political ideology?"**
She realized that she was talking like an interrogator and dialed it back a little. ***I like it here and I won't have this threatened by anyone!*** A quick glance at Tar'ja then back to SBC.
**"I understand you need a shut-down cycle but we are fresh from what now seems like an extraction and I'd like a little more information about what we've gotten ourselves into before your nap. Perhaps you could provide us what customary details you've found others in our situation have either asked or have needed?"**

Tar'ja was fairly relaxed in this atmosphere of..friends.. and the need for sleep was becoming apparent to her. However, the droid had begun to talk and the others had begun the questions. Sitting up slightly the woman was doing her best to keep interest...until he mentioned his employers house.
The twi'lek stiffened at the mention of such a thing, her back straightens up and her interest level peaks, perhaps it wasn't what she thought it to be..no need to get so ansy, she'd been away from there for a long time, they were gone and she was her own master in life now.
"What is your 'employers house', as you said, called? To what organization is your 'employers house' affiliated? A certain planetary government? Consortium? Political ideology?" The woman spoke in such a manner as one use to the ways of interrogation. An interesting thing to know but the twi'lek had to agree. These were things that needed to be answered.
"Is there anything you can tell us to expect from our meeting with your employer?" A simple question in comparison to those by the others but she thought perhaps it was just as important.

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

The droid waits as your group asks a continual stream of questions. Bowing slightly as Dexter leaves the room, even watching Chase as his face contorts in confusion at the Bothan`s actions.
Finally when the droid notices a pause in the questions he nods to Chase. "Yes I have been online for some time now. And no there are many differences among the Bothan people including their professional techniques, though I must admit I do not recognize this Bothan`s techniques ... how interesting."
SBC stares off down the corridor at Dexter as the spy heads for the engine room. Turning now to Deidra the droid continues "Resource well I have been labeled many things before, its has been a long time since I was labeled a resource." The droid pauses and for a moment you could almost imagine its displeasure at the label. "As for the rest of your questions I will leave that to my employer to answer."
Turning finally to Tar`ja SBC continues "My employer is mindful and calculating. Show respect in his presence and you will receive the same. I am sure upon our arrival they will have as many questions for you as you have for them. Now I must check the cargo, then shut down for a while." The droid starts down the corridor and is gone into the nearest cargo hold.

Chase sat there next to Tar'ja as the Droid deflected most of the questions from the two ladies. He listened to the metallic feet as they clanged down the hall to the cargo hold. Despite the lack of information given SBC seemed to have said something to peaked each of their interests. Just what those were he couldn't tell. The Force could tell him a lot of things just not everything. He let his head fall back against the wall. Though the didn't hurt the soft thud was audible.
**"Not exactly very forth coming with the information for being on line for 200 years.** He picked up his head and looked at the bottle of alcohol. **"Still, we're off the planet where sooner or later we would have been caught or stuck there with no way off."** He looked at Deidra as the next thing he was going to say he was sure to bother her in some way. **"The Force put all of us here together for a reason."**

Kasga sits skeptically while SBC answers questions. He looks more interested as SBC talks about Kirn, but more confused at the explanation.
He responds to Chase, **"Yeah, he's always been font of information. Interesting that he thought Kirn was employed by his owner. Kirn didn't talk me about mercenary employ. He talked about being involved in the Rebellion. Does the Rebellion actually consider it's members to be employees?"**
Frowning, he continues, **"I have quite a few questions for this droid's owner, particularly if he's not part of the Rebellion."**

## Re: Chapter one: Finders Keepers

### **Yogi** (2010-06-14 23:38:28)

Chase listened as Kasga talked. He didn't think of it like Kasga did. The Duros had a good head on his shoulders. The young Jedi saw what he thought was a frown from the blue skinned alien. "I have quite a few questions for this droid's owner, particularly if he's not part of the Rebellion."
Chase nodded at the statement. **"I think we all have questions pertaining to that fact. This 'house' he belongs to and the fact he didn't mention the Rebellion at all since getting on this ship. The only thing that sits well with me right now is that SBC and seemingly his 'employer' have no love for the Empire. I guess for now that will have to be enough. Though I suggest that we stay focused and alert. Best that we don't give away the farm do to speak."**
He reached for his drink and took a long pull from it. It was a shame that they didn't have more. At least tonight they could enjoy it. Not for long though. The events of the past few days have proven to be taxing and he was getting sleepy. A small yawn escaped and he covered it with the back of his hand.

<strong>The cold vacuum of space&#8230; everyones final resting place.</strong>
"My employer is mindful and calculating. Show respect in his presence and you will receive the same. I am sure upon our arrival they will have as many questions for you as you have for them." Naryen considered how that was a direct answer to one of her questions, finding herself grateful for that, and how badly members of Imperial Intelligence would want to get their hands on that droids brain. ***200 years!*** Then it occurred to her what else SBC had said. ***"His" then "They"? How interesting.***
A smirk, after Dexter, as the bothan dismissed himself. ***Priorities sir agent, sleep before combat whether physical or verbal. Indeed.*** Having been reminded of her fatigue, Naryen slumped a bit and stifled a yawn.
She relaxed a bit more, realizing that pressing the droid would gain nothing, as evident by its word choices. A bit of reminisce as she thought back to her previous life. So much time and devotion yet this new way of living, only days old, seemed more comfortable to her somehow. Like what she was doing before had this undercurrent of tension that she was grateful was finally at an end. She recalled, too, how her xeno-anthropology courses had spoken about some people validate their choices by say other people or other forces were in control of their lives as a way to absolve responsibility for their choices.
She snickered a little within herself as the implications wove themselves out like a tapestry. ***Perhaps those are the ones that others manipulate as they know the choices they make are their own?*** Naryen was thankful that she had this down-time to do a mental house-cleaning. ***Hadn't been done it a while and it's getting rather crowded*** an inward chuckle, then ***How much of my life choices were really my own since so much was kept from me?*** Some of what they taught her, and her peers, was propaganda against terrorist religions that ***"Removed free will and created guidance systems of citizens and called them martyrs!"***
Her thoughts darkened. ***I wonder if the people that ordered my parents death were consoled in that they 'had no choice'?***
"The Force put all of us here together for a reason."
The words reached her like a hand across the face. The sting was evident across her features and she shot Chase a look. He seemed not to note it much, or expected it, as he casually talked on with Kasga then went back to his drink. ***Such casual disregard…? No he's just comfortable, like me.***
**"I think I'll follow Dexter and SBCs example. We won't get anything useful from the droid and everything we've done and said has been recorded for its patron. I think we need to be on the top of our game and get some rest.** *yawn and a rather serpentine stretch* every bit a sensual female expression. **"I have a feeling that we've traded one war zone for another."** She brought her hands to rest, fingers clasped behind her head. A rather masculine pose all of a sudden.
She looked around the room to those that remained her features, and tone, becoming more formal. **"Unless we take this opportunity to get to know each other?"** For all her yawns and stretches her eyes are vibrant, alert, and seemingly taking in everything, as the pass from each person, a lightening of her expression when she looked to Tar'ja, then to rest on Chases face. An eyebrow raises, slightly.

Tar'ja watches the droid leave the room, closing her eyes briefly with a sigh; hardly the information needed, as though they wouldn't give respect; even if this employer had a hand somewhere in getting the Imperials on them. She listened quietly to the Duros and the Jedi talk about the employer, considering what it took to get here, she would be severely upset if this had nothing to do with the Rebellion at all...granted...whatever it might be it brought her to these people and a chance at change and letting go.
She sighs and shifts her relaxed pose against the Jedi's shoulder, Lekku twitching as she watches the Jedi take his drink and pull from it, She was comfortable but she wanted a bit too, how was this remedied? simple! she waited until he was about to set the glass back down before taking it in her own hands, and sips lightly at it. Not too much, her own glass was on the table still beside his, easy enough to pour into one glass.
Her thoughts had gotten off track somewhere, and only now realized she hadn't been really paying much attention, "Unless we take this opportunity to get to know each other?" Pale eyes glance over to the human woman with a faint smirk on her lips at the raised brow on her features "I've already told my secret, I believe you three have some to share hm?"

AS he was about to set his drink down he felt Tar'ja shift again. This time it was different. She was reaching forward and he saw her lilac colored hand take the top of his glass only to take it from his hand and proceed to take a drink from it. An incredulous half grin formed on his face as he laughed out loud at her move. She relaxed again taking the same position as before the drink pilfering had begun. **"Sharing huh? I can live with that."** He chuckled again and relaxed himself enjoying the closeness of the beautiful Twi'lek woman.
Deidra shared the census of being tired despite the alertness he saw in her eyes. The yawn and stretch from the little body seemed to have brought back a bit of life in Deidra at lease for the time being. She confirmed it by her question t the three of them. "Unless we take this opportunity to get to know each other?"
***Stories. A piece of our past shared among friends. A chance to bond even more. Perhaps but how much to tell they already know my big secret.***
Tar'ja was the first to answer and it brought him out of his thoughts. "I've already told my secret, I believe you three have some to share hm?"
He looked at Tar'ja and then to the other two. He nodded his head slightly. **"Alright, I'll go. You all already know about my secret and it's importance. I'm not sure what the droid knows but I'm sure he heard about the fight in the cantina so it wont be news to him if he hears it."**
He reached for the drink again emptied the glass. Taking a breath like the ones he did when they were first in the cantina to calm himself. Maybe only Tar'ja would catch the attempt to relax.
**"About nine months ago. Master Garet died. He was the Jedi Master that took me on as a padawan learner. A fancy name for a student."** He added. **"He taught me, trained me to fight against the Empire and dark Jedi that Vader would send for us. Which he did. We were on the run from a group of bounty hunters. They had pursued us for a month across several systems. Inevitably they caught up with us. It was going to come down to a fight somewhere, sometime. In an effort to make it harder for them to find us we split up for several days and agreed to meet back at a public place. Three days passed and I was able to evade them."** He paused for a moment. He hadn't thought about this in a while. Being with them had busied his mind and made him focus on other things and not what happened.
Again he took a breath. **"I was late in getting there but as I got close to the rendezvous point I felt a disturbance in the Force. Something wasn't right. I heard screams and the market area began to disperse. There was master Garet and almost a dozen of the bounty hunters that had followed us. Hired by Vader to track down any Jedi and eliminate them. Despite what stories or fables you may have heard…"** He paused as a painful memory washed across his face. **"We can die just like the next person."** He looked at Deidra to make sure that she knew he wasn't still an enemy.
**"I felt his presence as he urged me to stay where I was. I wanted to go help but one thing he had drilled in to me was that I listen to him. Times are dangerous and one of us, no matter what, needed to survive."** He had closed his eyes now. His memory providing him all he needed to see. His voice took on a tone of sorrow.
**"The battle started, blaster fire and thermal detonators were thrown. He managed to turn away most of the blaster fire and two of the thermals back on to the group. The resulting explosions rocked the area. By the time I was able to see I was closer. I had used the crowd to remain hidden. Garet lay in a bloody mess along with eight of the bounty hunters. Anger like I had never known came to me then. I could have used that anger to strengthen my abilities. Draw upon the Dark Side of the Force and cut down the rest of them with little effort."** The pace of his speech had quickened, his eyes now open revealing the hurt that was there. His fists were balled up as he sat forward. The anger had come back full force at the telling of the story.
**"But I didn't."** He said quietly as his breathing came back under control. **"A calmness came over me and I heard Master Garet through the Force. Telling me to run."** He looked down at the table his eyes resting on the glass he and Tar'ja had used. **"And for the first time in my life, I ran. He was like a father to me."** The last he added softly.
**"Three weeks later I secured a job on a freighter called the *Bloodhawk.* the same ship I had met Rasen on, Dosennaa's husband."** He smile at the thought of his friend. **"It was a terrible job but it got me off planet and I was able to loose the rest of the bounty hunters. The crew were all good except the XO. A Twi'lek named Zet. He was cruel to all and only the captain kept him in line. You all heard about the story about the slaves being transported to the Trandos on some planet I can't even remember the name of. Well Zet had a plan betray the crew and sell us off to the Trandos while taking the ship for himself.** He looked at his glass again wishing it had more in it. He cracked his knuckles instead and found that his hand had found Tar'ja's and reflexively gave it a squeeze.
**"His plan didn't work out and I left Zet there lying there as we managed to get away under fire. I can only hope the Trandos gave him what he deserved. The rest of us made it to Druckenwell, sold the ship and split the profit among us and those that were released from the carbonite. From there I hitched another ride to Tatooine to give Rasen's belongings to his wife. Where I met Kasga and then the rest of you."** He let a small smile escape for he was happy to be among people he considered friends. Friends he had fought along side and would fight for.
**"I think you know the rest."** He sat back now like before. His hand still held Tar'ja's in a firm reassuring grip. As if taking strength from his friend to finally settle the demons of the last nine months. It had felt good to tell them what had brought him to them. As he had said earlier and he believed it to his very core, they were brought together for a reason.

Tar'ja returns to airing secrets again. Chase's secret is known. His history on the Bloodhawk was new as was the relationship with his mentor. I wonder if we will have to worry about those dark Jedi using us to get to him.
Holding his questions, Kasga says, **"None of these are really secrets. As I said before, the Tantooine Rebellion cell leaks information like a seive. My story is already known. I joined the Reapers right before the shuttle assault mission. Turns out the mission was compromised. We were targeting an admiral. The Empire found out about the mission and set a trap for us. We lost 3. We abandoned the mission once we realized it was a trap. I hid out until I thought the Imperial patrols were had moved on. I miscalculated the time and got shot down by a SAM. I dodged patrols until I could get into Bestine. There I ran into Chase and we ran out of town on the first beat up swoop."**
Thinking back, Kasga muses, **"That's the reason I've been so twitchy about secrecy and I don't trust SBC. That's also the reason I have so many questions for his "employer"."**

Tar'ja listens to both stories, the first had an odd sense of sympathy that was fairly new to her, but seeing as it was directed to one that was making her feel odd things well...that was somewhat understandable she supposed.
Her hand shifted to rest upon the Jedi's knee, a vague sign of comfort maybe, his story was sad, but things made more sense now, how he was, perhaps how he wasn't very good at deflecting blaster bolts, it didn't matter. His words were right though, whatever the force thing was it must have brought them all together.
Kasga's was short, she liked short, it showed he still wished to hold some things in secret unless completely around those that he trusted, she could understand and respect that.
Diedra had yet to mention her story, the Twi'lek turning expectantly to her while she muffled a yawn behind her own hand, sleep was calling to her, a comfortable bed and clean sheets as well, but she would hold fast, and hear the last of the stories before they decided on sleeping arrangements.
