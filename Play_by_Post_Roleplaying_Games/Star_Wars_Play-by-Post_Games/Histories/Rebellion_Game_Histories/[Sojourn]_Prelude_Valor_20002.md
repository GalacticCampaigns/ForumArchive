Grand in design the imperial star destroyer is a tribute to the ingenuity of the war machine. Cruising threw space its spear like shape send many of the empires enemies packing at the mere mention of its presence. The imperial star destroyer Adjudicator is a model of the empires ships of the line. Her Captain a versed man from Curasant, Captain Prewart runs a rigid and well polished crew. Discipline is rewarded on board and only a select few make the Captains hand picked officer staff.
As a ranked officer you are currently making progress towards you next mission briefing. The small mouse droid races through the corridors towards your destination. The little droids dark shell contrasts the corridors sterile white walls. Standard policy onboard the Adjudicator storm troopers escort officer staff. Flanking you are two one a low ranked grunt the other sergeant Thomas Lars. Sergeant Lars has been assigned to you since Kashyyyk. Your personal communications trooper, its his job to ensure to personally oversee that your orders are followed within your unit.
The only trooper you have conversed with outside of dictating orders. Thomas is a volunteer from Curasant his free nature has gotten him reprimanded in the past but you have found it refreshing in comparison to the rest of the ships brass. Since Kashyyyk Thomas has kept to himself , something on that mission had broken the man. Anytime Kashyyyk had been mentioned since he merely dismissed himself politely from the conversation.
It is to your surprise that he addresses you today â€œSir! Where do you think the next mission will take us?â€ The other trooper keeps to himself and focused on the mouse droid. Within the corridors the ships crew continue their daily routines some following similar mouse droids. It reminds you of the small nerf herds back home.

*Reminising about the nerf herds back home with a small smile*
> â€œSir! Where do you think the next mission will take us?â€

*Blink*. "I'm sure we'll find out soon enough Sergeant, being a part of these officer briefings with Captain Prewart is quite a privledge. Personally I'd enjoy something other than terrorist suppression but given the way things have been going I think there's a small chance of that. Go where we're needed and all that." Reasuring smile in Lars' direction. "All our efforts have an effect. Sometimes it's the small effects that make the difference."
Maneouvering around other officers and troopers in the hall her thoughts drift to how little she feels that herself lately then focusses on Lars again. Reading his body language through his armour she pours more conviction in then she feels herself "It *will* get better Sergeant."

Sargent Lars ignores the last comment and regains a singular focus as his counter part trooper already had done. These star destroyers are huge and to the novice an impossible maze. More then one Trooper had joked how the mouse droid was the back bone of the imperial fleet.
The little droid halts in front of a double blast door flanked by a pair of troopers standing guard. The droids seemingly random series of chimes indicate you have arrived at your destination.
Sargent Lars stands at attention salutes you "Sir ready for your orders at a moments notice sir!" Lars nods to your other troopers and they take their leave.
Before you the double blast doors open revealing a mission briefing room within. Inside a white protocal droid serves drinks to the other ships officers who all sit around an oval table. The lights have been dimmed and a holo projection of a blueish white planet slowly rotates over the tables center.
Captain Prewart the only man standing in the room lowers his inferred pointer and addresses your entrance "Ah Lt. Fae how good of you to join us." His note of sarcasm is not missed and the other officers exchange glances. "A seat if you will Lt. Fae."

Adds some rigidity to her stance & expression. "Yes Sir." Then takes her assigned seat & waves off the attending droid. After a round table glance to the others attending brings her focus to the displayed planet for any recognition and then to Captain Prewart.

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-29 12:21:51)

As you take your seat Captain Prewart waits for you to become comfortable. Which seams to take a lot longer then it actually does as the other officers all stop to watch you as well. The bluish white planet in the holo-projection is well known to you. Itâ€™s Varlbrindal, your home.
Captain Prewart continues the briefing as child hood memories flood back to you. Memories of childhood friends and family. â€œRebel sympathizers have been tracked to this planet. I do not have to tell you the importance of a core world like Varlbrindal. We can not allow this kind of scum to run loose within her streets. It is our duty to protect the empire.â€ Captain Prewart looks down at you then continues. â€œOur mission has two objectives. Our primary goal is to flesh out the rebel resisters. Our secondary objective is to maintain the peace on Varlbrindal.â€ Captain Prewart pauses to take a drink of water. The other officers exchange glances and a few murmured words.
Captain Prewart resumes his briefing. â€œI have chosen you Lt. Fae to head up the landing party and direct our units. The entire operation will be overseen from the Adjudicator. Your mission begins at 0500am, any questions?â€

### **Rebaav** (2008-10-30 16:08:54)

> Itâ€™s Varlbrindal, your home.

A sense of tension rises in Naryens gut from having recognized home. *They are looking for a response*. A look of cautious expectation is worn naked.
> â€œRebel sympathizers have been tracked to this planet.&quot;

*Sympathizers? Rebels?* After what happened on Kashyyk, after all the proven misinformation and the internal propoganda Naryen allows the tension to spill over onto her face. She swallows and now regrets turning away the drink from the attending protocol droid. Fear cracks her expression. *What are they going to do to the people of Varlbrindal?*
> &quot;I do not have to tell you the importance of a core world like Varlbrindal. We can not allow this kind of scum to run loose within her streets. It is our duty to protect the empire.â€ Captain Prewart looks down at you then continues. â€œOur mission has two objectives. Our primary goal is to flush out the rebel resisters. Our secondary objective is to maintain the peace on Varlbrindal.â€

*Reasonable enough.* With confidence returning she allows that to show on her face. The gathering resolve of someone being called upon to defend her homeland.
> â€œI have chosen you Lt. Fae to head up the landing party and direct our units. The entire operation will be overseen from the Adjudicator. Your mission begins at 0500am, any questions?â€

She acknowledges Captain Prewarts with a nod & eye contact. "Yes thank-you. I apologise if this has already been addressed" gesturing & glancing around the room to acknowledge to the assembled officers "but what is the status of our dossiers on the resistors? Knowing ones prey helps the hunt and" eyes the planetary display, "I already know the terrain." allowing her resolve to harden then brings that to bear on Captain Prewart.

Captain Prewart looks down on you. The all male officer staff comes to hush. â€œWe have some reports of a ship blasting its way off of Varltpin. The local customs where unable to set pursuit but had tracked their jump to this system.â€ Captain Prewart looks back to the image of Varlbrindal obviously unhappy with his answer. Speaking more to himself then the room The Captain continues â€œOur orders come directly from the emperor himself.â€
Just as the Captain finishes answering your question the rooms dimmed lights are replaced with flashing red lights. Sirens blare on all levels of the ship. An alert is broadcast throughout â€œBattle station! Battle stations! Varlbrindal is under attack!â€
The mission room begins to clear as officerâ€™s race out. The captain turns to you at the door â€œScratch that your mission starts now. Get to the surface and report back as soon as possible.â€

*The Emperor!?*
> Just as the Captain finishes answering your question the rooms dimmed lights are replaced with flashing red lights. Sirens blare on all levels of the ship. An alert is broadcast throughout â€œBattle station! Battle stations! Varlbrindal is under attack!â€

*Varlbrindal! No!* Again a shift of doubt. *Attack my home? Not if I have anything to do with it you won't.* She rises with the other officers and makes to leave. One of the last she turns to Captain Prewart at the door.
> The mission room begins to clear as officerâ€™s race out. The captain turns to you at the door â€œScratch that your mission starts now. Get to the surface and report back as soon as possible.â€

"Yes Sir." Snaps a salute then opens her mouth to say something else *Later*, stops, nods then sets off at a jog with the mouse droid escort.
She taps the encrypted com link at her right ear, standard to Sargent Lars, "I want a copy of the Varltpin incident report linked to Varlbrindal on my pad with a sitrep for latest & prior status summaries when I arrive. Have the encryption level escalated accordingly." She continues to weave between officers troopers and pilots with her mouse droid at her toes.
*This is no different than any other snap drill or other fast response.* Never before had a thought seemed to thoroughly hollow.

The briefing room emptyâ€™s quickly as everyone rushes to their stations. Your mouse droid races you towards one of the many hangers on board the Adjudicator.
â€œLars here sir!â€ As usual Thomas is expeditious in his responses. â€œVarltpin incident report yes sir! Making the request now. The ship is prepped and ready to go. The Duergars are boarding as we speak and the Greenbacks are on route. Lars out!â€
Your data pad alerts you to a new message. Reading it over it gives you transfer orders for the Greenback unit to your command. It also gives you a map of Varbrindal divided into sectors. Most of the sectors are reporting orange indicating an unclear zone. The capital city Varlbrin is showing red indicating a hot zone. Several reports stream in indicating more attacks within Varlbrin.
In the hanger two Shuttles wait for departure. Sargent Lars meets you at the ramp and passes you a data pad. With a salute Lars shouts â€œThe Varltpin report sir!â€ The second shuttle is still being loaded as troopers from green back rush inside.

*Efficient as always.* Small grin. *I expect it will be downloaded en route so I can review it. It should be an interesting read.*

Acknowledges the Greenback transfer orders then gleans the incident reports. *What are they doing!?* ((Gather information used to deduce any pattern that can be gleaned so far assuming that skill can be used that way.)) Check for approach vector, threat assessments and terrain checks. ((Does Naryen know this location personally? Favorite holo cafe etc?))
> In the hanger two Shuttles wait for departure. Sargent Lars meets you at the ramp and passes you a data pad. With a salute Lars shouts â€œThe Varltpin report sir!â€

Mental note to speak with Deployment Operations about not having Drop Ships on standby for exactly this reason. *Incompetence… or Impotence. Ridiculous.*. Small grin anyway & chuckles shaking her head. To Lars: "Excellent." Taking the report and securing herself aboard the Shuttle (for a tactical drop "Sigh.") she reviews the report on the Varltpin incident.

The second shuttle finishes loading and both ships launch. Your view port is dominated by the bluish white planet, memories of home come back to you. Varlbrin itself the most populated settlement was well traveled. Much of your education was taken within its universities.
The greenbacks seem eager but â€¦. Well just that green. You do remember they are fresh out if space dock, replacements after Kashyyyk.
During the short flight reports coming from the various check points, many of which are temporary. Most are reporting bombing attacks others riots. Martial lock down has been initiated within Varlbrin and the surrounding area.
The Varltpin report is sparse to say the least. No profiles only a meager description of a transport blasting off after refusing an inspection team. The local customs ships are sub light only therefore could not continue the chase. Disappointed in the amateur report you pack it away.
Seeing how this mission is to restore and maintain peace only personal is sent no heavy equipment. Your ships arrive at the local port where you said goodbye to your family. This port began your carrier within the empire.
Several troopers stand at attention when you exit the ramp. To greet stands a young Lt most likely a local. â€œSir welcome to Varlbrindal sir!â€ The young clean cut officer looks nervous and flinches as an explosion sets off in the distance. â€œYour .. your orders sir?â€

So little time for anything else there, so much opportunities... sigh. *I've really got to take some time here soon. Wind skating on the southern glacier, haven't done that since…*
> The greenbacks seem eager but â€¦. Well just that green. You do remember they are fresh out if space dock, replacements after Kashyyyk.

Perhaps we can do better here...

Review particulars of the bombings. Security footage recovered from just prior to attacks for any indication for an origin. Numbers. Position. Anything!
> Martial lock down has been initiated within Varlbrin and the surrounding area.

Stuff blows up, people get locked down. Something went right, will wonders never cease.
> The Varltpin report is sparse to say the least. No profiles only a meager description of a transport blasting off after refusing an inspection team. The local customs ships are sub light only therefore could not continue the chase. Disappointed in the amateur report you pack it away.

No information from the port on the ship, crew, manifests of any kind, no destination reports. *How do they know it has anything to do with Varlbrin!? This is ridiculous! A total intel failure,* recalling Kashyyyk... *AGAIN!*
> Seeing how this mission is to restore and maintain peace only personal is sent no heavy equipment. Your ships arrive at the local port where you said goodbye to your family. This port began your career within the empire.

Mom and dad, the hopeful looks, the tears farewell... the imagined look of disapointment after not having done more to help the Kashyyk situation... *How could Naval Intelligence not have known? How could they not have secured the basics about the Varltpin incident? I understand the need for a united front and galactic morale but still. Not even a background check!? What's going on??*Fists tighten.
> Several troopers stand at attention when you exit the ramp. To greet stands a young Lt most likely a local. â€œSir welcome to Varlbrindal sir!â€ The young clean cut officer looks nervous and flinches as an explosion sets off in the distance. â€œYour .. your orders sir?â€

Watches the nervous whelp and can't help but recall a Velocibat swooping off with a Nerf youngling. *What does he think he's screwed up and what has he actually screwed up?*"Leutenant Naryen Fae Comanding officer attached Adjudicator. I've reviewed the incoming reports so could I have your SitRep brief while you escort me to comm central." *and perhaps you can tell me why you've allowed terrorists to attack my home.*

The Lt salutes nervously it becomes obvious he is very green. â€œSir yes Sir! This was sir. I am Lt Sallo Prine reporting for duty sir!â€ The Lt motions to the port control tower. â€œWe have a command center set up inside. Sir we are undermanned here. More and more of our troops have been reassigned to the front lines.â€
Escorted by several troopers including Thomas you make your way to the command center. Inside three more raw recruits sit manning stations. Data streams across the display panels as the recruits struggle to keep up with it all.
Lt Prine pauses the salutes you â€œSir the command center sir!â€
The recruits turn and salute you. They all report in unison.
-â€œAnother four explosions have been confirmed in sectors B4, C9 and Z141.â€
-â€œSir sector E24 has been completely over run. The check point has stopped transmitting.â€
-â€œSir! Probe droids have been deployed and will start shortly. Captain Prewart demands an update. Also several ships have begun blasting off the surface sir!â€

Return the salute sharply and without losing momentum turns to & reviews the data with an impassionate expression. Specific attention to the timelines. *Panic in the streets, is that it? These are just non-coms being dropped into a fire zone…*
> -â€œSir! Probe droids have been deployed and will start shortly.

*Excellent.*

"I want detailed reports on the latest explosions on sectors B4, C9 and Z141 5 minutes ago!"
> -â€œSir sector E24 has been completely over run. The check point has stopped transmitting.â€

"Sargent Lars get Greenback to that checkpoint ASAP. Lethal force is only to be answered in kind otherwise stun is the order of the day. We need to get control of this situation and we need information. Dead terrorists fine. Dead civilians totally unacceptable and will be investigated thoroughly. We have got to get the non coms out of that area as fast as possible. See to it."
> Captain Prewart demands an update. Also several ships have begun blasting off the surface sir!â€

"Get those comfirmation reports to Captain Prewart at once and prepare to patch me through to general broadcast from this station only do NOT simultransmit using the relay stations." *I hope this works.* calming breath "When that's ready send the following: This is Lt Fae. Please try to remain calm. We are dispatching troopers to escort all civilians away from the affected areas. I understand your confusion and we are efforting a safe end as quickly as possible. Please cooperate with the security forces so we can ensure your safety" Nod to the communications officer. "That's it, secure and send that out and close that channel then patch me in to Admiral Prewart with the attached sitrep." Another nod to the comm, " Send the following: This is Lt. Fae reporting. Things are falling apart fast here Captain. We have reports of our checkpoints being overrun and more explosions as enclosed. Have we had and sensor reports from the effected areas? Some idea of where these attacks are coming from could be a great help in stopping it. We appear to be on the brink of general panic."

Sergeant Lars snaps to attention with a quick salute â€œSir yes Sir!â€ Thomas points at two troopers and makes a circular motion with them, indicating a sweep of the perimeter. He motions to the remaining troopers waving his back hand from side to side ordering a local guard posting.
The recruit nods at your order for bombing reports â€œYes sir.â€ Then returns to his station. The others quickly follow suit. One of the recruits begins to compose your message to Captain Prewart.
Your second order to Thomas has him on the comm and heading for the door. â€œSir yes sir! Sergeant Beto I am on route to your position you have two minutes to have your unit ready Lars out.â€
Another recruit replies questionly â€œOpen broad cast will be ready shortly sir?â€ On some of the monitors you can see the probe droids progress through the city. S4 has made it to sector B4.

To that comm officer working on the packet to Prewart: "Set him up a secure line if he wants a direct encoding. Liase with Adjudicator Comm Main on that and default to them." *There that should take some heat of him and if Captain Prewart want's face time that should allow it.* Looks at the recruits. "Verify with me before sending."

"Good. Show me the workup before you launch it." another reassuring nod then returns her attention to the displays. *When did I become a comm basics instructor?*

"I want ETAs on the other probe droids and as soon as they've arrived feed in their sensors in real time." looks at the S4 read, "Bring that one in right now, let's see what it sees." *Perhaps now we'll get some answers.* Crosses her arms to relieve some tension.

The recruit nods and throws a half salute "Yes sir encoding your transmission now." With a series of console taps the communication is almost ready.
The broad cast recruit a short thin boy most likely no more then nineteen salutes "Yes sir."
The last recruit nods at your instructions and brings up the ETA results. Most of the droids will be in visual range in moments. The blip indicating the droid in sector S4 flashes before a window overlays part of the display. Before the droid is a full blow riot. Smoke rises in various sections of the city, at least three columns of smoke arise in this view alone. Citizens are rushing a check point trying to escape, many have been trampled some shoot.
On the side streets troopers attempt to maintain order. Those troopers not engaged in hand to hand combat with civilians are firing on them.
Just as this scene comes into view Lt Prine smiles "Ah I see order will be restored shortly, they are some of our finest troopers." The Lt smiles in satisfaction as he watches on.
Below the droid a Twi`lek woman with a child in tow fend off against a trooper. Tall, lithe, and lilac in color; She stands at a height of 5â€™8â€ her lekku are attractive, not large as she would like but not small either, a delicate middle ground would be best to describe them. Her eyes are a pale shade of blue, a contrast to her skin tone but nonetheless pretty. Her clothes though tight fitting are not very revealing; only enough to aid in her work. Black in color with purple lowlights to accentuate her coloring; True she has used many other clothes, some far more revealing to aid her in a hit but for the most this is her normal attire. Her headband is also black and wraps around her lekku down to the tips, purple strips of leather line it. The only thing that seems out of place is a choker around her neck, though also black has broken chains all around it.
The Twi`lek shoves a man in front of her who then falls to blaster fire from the trooper. The Twi`lek with the girl in tow ducks into the crowd.

*Good, that seemed to help them. I've become an instructor.* Recalls the heated exchanges she'd had in public and private with her Ground Tactics instructor: *…Damn!*

Her arms fall slack to her side and her eyes widen. She steps towards the display, like a poorly suppressed urge to reach out and check for a pulse on the downed civilians or do anything for them herself.
> Below the droid a Twi`lek woman with a child in tow fend off against a trooper.

Well this seems to have caught Naryens' attention! Wow! She uses the tactile interface and pulls it's attention back to that timestamp. To the sensor operator **"Set the probe to track this one."** points & marks the Twi`lek on the dashboard.
She then speaks in a steady & practiced tone, for her benifit as much as the others, **"Send this as general broadcast to all troopers & officers at once: *This is the current officer in charge! Effective immediately premptive use of lethal force is not authorized. Any further incidents are being recorded and will be investigated. Sentences up to and including execution.*"** Nod at the comm officer. **"Broadcast that at once then proceed with your previous instructions."** The tone used there should elicit a shiver from anyone paying any attention at all.
Without delay, or notice to anything Lt. Prine says, Naryen dispenses those orders then turns towards him. As she turns she taps her personal comm over to the other preprogrammed channel **"Sgt Sims report to the Control room at once and bring 2 Troopers with you."** Taps off the comm, facing the Lt Prine, and removes her sidearm from her hip holster and thumbs off the safety as a single and practiced move. She holds out her left hand, with her right now at her side holding her pistol, and says to Lt Prine in the same tone cold practiced tone, **"Remove your sidearm Lt."** If there is any hessitation at all she will snap her weapon up to point at his chest and repeat, in a tone with more force, ***"Remove your sidearm Lt!"***. The weapon is on stun by default (and she would know if it has been changed from the position of the stub when drawing it so if she needs to change it it's done when it's drawn) so if he hessitates further she will simply shoot him.
When Sgt Sims (when he hears her tone that man will be half way there before he even knows what he's doing) enters the comm station with the troopers she will have them remove Lt Prine, regardless of what state he is in, whatever can pass for a cell (locked door). All of this should happen extremely quickly and the orders, for witness of the master recording in the comm center she will say outloud **"Lt Prine is hereby relieved of duty and to be taken into custody for suspected colusion with the terrorist element responsible for the attacks. Any actions needed to subdue him and prevent any further interference are fully authorized"**. When it's done she'll return her attention to the display and speak to the sensor operator **"Replay from when she shows in frame here and zoom in to full screen for playback."** *Playing a hunch here, let's see what happens…*
> The Twi`lek shoves a man in front of her who then falls to blaster fire from the trooper. The Twi`lek with the girl in tow ducks into the crowd.

*Was that happenstance or is this a terrorist using the civilians as a shield?*

The recruit taps a few controls, you can see the droid target the woman and set to follow. See ducks through the alley and into the next street. The street is empty, the woman still has the little girl in tow. From this angle you can see a faint glow coming from a case the woman holds.
The recruit nods and says "The droid is on route sir. Shall I send a detachment in after her?"
At the next terminal another recruit finishes his work "Broadcast sent sir, and on a repeating loop until your command. I have also sent out the progress reports to Captain Prewart, sir."
In shock that you would raise a weapon against him Lt Prine shakes his head refusing to surrender. "No you are the enemy you have betrayed the empire!"
Again you command that he remove his side arm and again he shakes his head. Sgt Sims enters with two troopers they take flanking positions beside you as Sims moves up behind LT Prine.
Feeling trapped Lt Prine swings around trying to maintain an eye on everyone surrounding him. "I am a loyal officer of the empire, you will lose you commission over this! I know people, I know people!" The troopers raise their weapons aiming at the Lt. You are amazed at their training they saw just before you Lt Prine reaching fro his side arm.

Just as the probes visuals display Lt Prine smiles and says with all the confidence of a child wielding his fathers hunting gear "Ah I see order will be restored shortly, they are some of our finest troopers." She has, sometimes when the nightmares are vivid, awakened with a falling feeling that now begins to creep on her. That sensation begins to intertwine with the maliciousness in that mans voice. Like a battered child striking out at the universe for some, likely imagined, wrong.
Her own confidence wavers when she sees the riots unfolding. Seeing the smoke rising from various sections of the city brings to mind the last debacle delivered onto a trusting populace that she was confronted with. Images of citizens fleeing in terror and instead of cooperating with professional security are being shot down by an equally panicking force entrusted to protect them. On the side streets troopers attempt to maintain order. Those troopers not engaged in hand to hand combat with civilians are firing on them. Her arms fall slack to her side and her eyes widen. She steps towards the display, like a poorly suppressed urge to reach out and check for a pulse on the downed civilians or do anything for them herself.
She then speaks in a steady & practiced tone, for her benifit as much as the others, **"Send this as general broadcast to all troopers & officers at once: *This is the current officer in charge! Effective immediately premptive use of lethal force is not authorized. Any further incidents are being recorded and will be investigated. Sentences up to and including execution.*"** Nod at the comm officer. **"Broadcast that at once then proceed with your previous instructions."**
For some reason she has yet to grasp a particular citizen, a female Twi'lek, stands out from the crowd and the clinically detached officer within still controls her actions and she calls attention to her.
**"Set the probe to track this one."** She points & marks the Twi`lek on tactile interface. Naryen checks and is pleased that her expression is still solid.
The recruit nods and says "The droid is on route sir. Shall I send a detachment in after her?"
**"Not yet."** She squints a little at the sight of something glowing from the Twi'Leks wrist and mentally notes the chrono-mark.
At the next terminal another recruit finishes his work "Broadcast sent sir, and on a repeating loop until your command. I have also sent out the progress reports to Captain Prewart, sir."
***Those weren't your orders recruit! Damnit!*** Naryen looks at him and says  **"Show me what you've done recruit."** Tilting her head towards the officer interace to indicate displaying it there, the last word was anunciated with anoyance she didn't intend to show. She flinches slightly at that, ***Too late now.*** and moves on.
Now, having identified a cancerous threat near her that same part aligns with the deeper instictual fear, the child quaking at the thought of her home being set ablaze with her family trapped within, and she moves to act. ***What has this traitor done to my home!*** Naryen then turns towards Lt Prine. As she turns she taps her personal comm over to the other preprogrammed channel.**"Sgt Sims report to the Control room at once and bring 2 Troopers with you."** Taps off the comm, facing the Lt Prine, and removes her sidearm from her hip holster and thumbs off the safety as a single and practiced move.
When Naryen and Lt Prines eyes meet his self satisfied smile collapses and his arrogance ramps up. She imagines a huge and ornate ancient clockwork device, cluttered with cobwebs and whiningly clunky, creaking forward a single turn of it's gears then seizing once again to silence. She suppresses the amused smile though she suspects some of it leaked to her eyes before she stopped it. ***Just smart enough to be dangerous, the worst kind of idiot!***
She holds out her left hand, palm up in an accepting gesture, with her right now at her side holding her pistol at the ready, and says to Lt Prine in a cold practiced tone, **"Remove your sidearm Lt."**. The weapon is always kept on stun by default, which she verified effortlessly as she drew. Putting on the required show when taking command from another officer under suspicion. Calm and composed.
In shock, apparantly that Naryen would draw a weapon against him, Lt Prine shakes his head refusing to surrender. "No you are the enemy you have betrayed the empire!" ***To betray you is to betray the Empire you say? Such arrogance!***
Naryen scows slightly. ***He can't be serious.*** She raises her weapon, pointing it at his chest, and this time with an abrupt, almost viloent force behind it **"Remove your sidearm Lt!"**. All very formal and histrionic and also, since her pistol is on stun, for his benifit if he tries anything stupid.
Sgt Sims enters with two troopers they take flanking positions beside you as Sims moves up behind LT Prine. **"Lt Prine is hereby relieved of duty and to be taken into custody for suspected colusion with the terrorist element responsible for the attacks. Any actions needed to subdue him and prevent any further interference are fully authorized."**.
Lt Prine swings around trying to maintain an eye on everyone surrounding him. "I am a loyal officer of the empire, you will lose you commission over this! I know people, I know people!" Naryen notices the troopers raising their weapons and tensing in a well trained response before she sees the shift in LT Prines body language as he reaches for his sidearm. She meets his eyes and sees murderous intent.
Naryen is visibly stunned. ***This idiot is going to draw on me to shoot me in front my armed troopers. He's suicidal and wants to take everyone else with him!*** Stunned that this imbecile would make such grandious and hostile movements directed at another officer and in front of troopers under that officers direct command. ***We need this traitor to the Empire alive. If I shoot him Sims and co will blow holes through him before he hits the ground.***
Naryen makes a decision and acts with the only move she thinks she can can accomplish fast enough. Turning her palm to face Lt Prine, a hold gesture, and projects her voice to Sims and the troopers **"Stun only!"** while keeping her eyes on Lt Prine then speaks at him **"Don't do it!"**

On the display you can see the electro binders glow. They secure her package to her so that no one could easily take the case from the Twi`lek woman. The child walks in front of the woman then the woman stops to check something. From this angle its too hard to make out what she is doing.
The recruit begins to open up his logs to show his progress as ordered. An then patently awaits as you casually dismiss him.
Lt Prine continues his rambling "I know if I kill you I will be awarded and your troops will be mine. Stand down troopers I am an officer of the empire. You will listen to me!" Lt Prine begins to pull out his blaster pistol.
Already with your shot lined up you squeeze the trigger firing a stun blast at the man. Lt Prines hair stands on end as the shock runs through his body. His eyes wide the man now has a crazed look on his face, something about him is not right.
Lt Prine lunges at you intending to make a quick kill. Again you snap off a stun blast. Even with his dumbed senses from the stun blast Lt Prine is able to duck below your blast. The man comes up to meet you face to face "This is between me and you traitor I will deal with you myself." Blaster in hand Prine fires hitting the console behind you. This forces the recruit to duck down on the floor. The carbon score Prine left on the console indicates the lethal setting on his blaster.
The console itself begins to flash red warning lights then abruptly ceases. The console continues to relay data. From behind Lt Prine Sims steps up and clubs the Lt in the back of the head with his rifle.
Lt Prine drops to the floor with a blank look on his face. Sgt Sims looks at you "Stunned sir!" Sims then motions for the other two troopers to carry the man away.
"Sir we have incoming." The recruit on communications speaks in a shaken voice. "Our troopers have brought in another wave of citizens for processing."
((initiative order Naryen 24 troopers 3 and Lt Prine 18

"I know if I kill you I will be awarded and your troops will be mine. Stand down troopers I am an officer of the empire. You will listen to me!" ***Ok, change of plans there!*** At the crazed look in his eyes Naryen fires, more out of self preservation that tactical planning. ***Great! Resourceful. Just smart enough to be dangerous and a maniac! Where did they find this winner?***
As the raving lunatic lunges at Naryen, she tries another shot, almost by reflex, but the lunatic ducks and comes up face to face with wild eyes, "This is between me and you traitor I will deal with you myself." Naryen can hear the lust for power purring in his voice as he takes a shot. From behind her she can hear some sensitive equipment protesting some considerable abuse.
From behind Lt Prine Sims steps up and clubs the Lt in the back of the head with his rifle. Lt Prine drops to the floor with a blank look on his face. Sgt Sims looks at Naryen "Stunned sir!" Sims then motions for the other two troopers to carry the man away.
Flashing a quick smirk at him, ***You sarcastic brat!*** then clears her throut to release some tension, **"Ahem. Well done Sgt. Please keep an eye on him and relieve him of anything he can use to harm himself or others or sabotage anything. Strip him bare if needed and contact Adjudicator Security and advise that we have a prisoner ready for transport and interrogation. Charges start with suspected collusion with local terrorists and continue with willful sabotage of Imperial Equipment during a time of crisis."** Nods to Sgt Sims for dismisial then points to the damaged console and directed to the room in general: **"Secure that station at once and triple check the diagnostic and error report."**
Naryen turns to the recruit she asked to display his action log on he main screen then motions him to hold as her clarity returns. Recalling the display from earlier Naryen brings the log back to the point when she noticed the electro binders. They appear to secure her package to her so that no one could easily take the case from the Twi`lek woman. The child walks in front of the woman then the woman stops to check something. From this angle its too hard to make out what she is doing.
**"Send this through the Probe there"** points to indicate the Twi`lek on the screen **"then send this: This is the current officer in charge. Please remain calm and where you are. We are trying to secure the area against further terrorist acts and need your assistance. If you need medical attention please let us know so it can be direct to you."** Nods to whatever recruit was dealing with that **"Send that at once."**
One of the recruit pipes up in a shakey voice "Sir we have incoming. Our troopers have brought in another wave of citizens for processing."
Naryen turns to that recruit. **"They are citizens in need of our help not guilded munitions! Now please bring up the sensor feed and the report to what you are refering to."** then she points to the master display to indicate that she'd like to see it. **"And see if we can get a secure line to Captain Prewart yet."**

The two troopers begin to drag officer from the control room. Sgt Sims follows nodding to you in acknowledgement of your orders then walks out of the room.
Bringing your attention back to the probe droids display, you find the console in functional condition. The mini screen showing the droids link now shows only static outlined in flashing red. The droids status reads offline.
The recruit looks at you and replies to you message order â€œSorry sir the target destroyed the probe droid.â€
The next recruit points to his screen and states â€œSir the locals are being brought inside for prossessing during the current crisis.â€ On the screen you see thousands of citizens being marched into holding areas, some into holding cells. As you watch the monitor your eyes widen at the sight. You can not believe your eyes among the citizens being marched into holding cells are your parents.

### **Rebaav** (2008-11-26 16:27:14)

Naryen turns from Sims and loots back to the probes live feed ... to see it lacking exactly that. Taking in the status display Naryen opens her mouth to order a playback of the feed recording when the recruit assists her with reading by explaining the status â€œSorry sir the target destroyed the probe droid.â€ ***Really? Prine was illiterate in addition to all his other qualities?***
**"Yes, thank you. Play-back the last moments before it was destroyed, put it on the main. Freeze just before she fires and zoom in on her and what she's carrying."**
Before the images loads Naryen recalls what the Twi'lek woman had done. Using others a shields, skillfully at that. Taking a child, easily transportable bargaining chip? Hostage? Secured to a case that seemed out of place, secured so that she could occupy herself otherwise. Firing on an unarmed surveillance droid. All explainable as someone escaping an insane situation... or someone needing to transport explosived to her next target. Clever guise.
Naryen looks up at the screen and abruptly barks out new orders. **"Lt. Naryen to Adjudicator request immediate additional reinforcements. Squad deployments to location in city so marked"** marks the location last reported by the destroyed probe droid **"possible bomber suspect located image attached"** marks the image. Naryen then turns her head to say transmit now when she notices the display the thousands of civilians being herded to the massive starport facility. **"and another squad deployment to this location. Transmit at once."**
The next recruit points to his screen and states â€œSir the locals are being brought inside for prossessing during the current crisis.â€ Watching the thousands of citizens being marched into holding areas Naryens eyes widen in shock. She tries to reconcile the military situation and the location indicators. ***Here! During a time of a terrorist attack by likely suicide bombers the idiot had them brought here. The communications hub. An imbedded terrorist mastermind couldn't have arranged it better…***  Her eyes widen.
Watching the faces go by Naryens mouth goes dry. She marks two people on the display and keys to her personal code. The two, a man and a woman cowering together looking at the troopers in fear, move with the flow of the crowd.
***Mom. Dad.***

Nodding towards you the recruit reverses the probes feed. The play back begins you can see the Twi`lek woman kneel donw then in one rapid fluid movement pull out a blaster pistol and fire. With a flash of light from the blaster the playback becomes garbled. Flickering the feed meets with the ground then nothing. The image changes to a zoom in of the case the woman was holding. Attached to her with electro binders you can see the blue pulse of the energy.
With this information on screen the com from the Adjudicator comes back to the control room. One of the onboard com officers chimes in, the sounds of battle can be heard all around â€œYour request has been noted. Please be advised that no further â€¦. â€œ The signal is lost cut off by another explosion from the com.

As the images loads Naryen recalls what the Twi'lek woman had done. Using others a shields, skillfully at that. Taking a child, easily transportable bargaining chip? Hostage? Secured to a case that seemed out of place, secured so that she could occupy herself otherwise. Naryen watches & notes the speed involved as the Twi`lek woman kneels down then in one rapid fluid movement pull out a blaster pistol and fires. Her eyes widen as the flickering feed meets with the ground then nothing. Also now firing on an unarmed surveillance droid. All explainable as someone escaping an insane situation... or someone needing to transport explosived to her next target. ***Clever. Very Clever.***
The com channel brings the reply, showing from the Adjudicator... something starts nagging at the back of her mind. She's missed something important. This snaps her out of her focus on the tide of people and imagining her Parents as driftwood smashing into cliffside surf.
On the line, from the Adjudicator, she hears the onboard com officers. Naryen frowns at the unmistakable noise of battle not going well, muffled explosions, warning klaxxons in the background and the unmistakable formality officers under stress use to smooth over their voices. â€œYour request has been noted." ***Lt. Jerinth! The man is terrified! What's going …*** Naryen recalls his demeanor from her time with him in Basics Comm Operations and Advanced Comm Operations. He always seemed very even tempered but he was making an effort remain steady. "Please be advised that no further ..." The signal is lost cut off by another explosion from the com. ***…on!?*** She imagines him consumed in a ball of superheated plasma...
The back-of-her-mind feeling came crashing to the front... ***Why hadn't the Adjudicator proactively offered sitreps?*** The recruits here should have offered but from being attacked by a fellow officer and seeing a major city of her home planet close to complete riot Naryen hadn't pushed. ***Duegar Squad was supposed to coordinate with Adjudicator fire control and report to me. I've asked to be connected with Adjudicator several times.***

All the read outs, reports, communication displays in direct contact between the control room and the Adjudicator cease. All three recruits begin working furiously trying to get some kind of information to report to you.
â€œSir I have a visual on the Adjudicator on screen now sir.â€ The recruit punches up his feed onto the main screen. â€œShe is still there but I am picking up multiple contacts. The Adjudicator is under attack sir.â€
The display shows the triangular star destroyer and several blips representing fighters. They are moving rapidly across the destroyers surface.
â€œDurger squad is reporting slow progress into the city and the greenbacks are still reporting large numbers of civilians coming in.â€ The next recruit report then his attention is taken away by a flashing light on his console. Across his screen you see Admiral Saycho`s personal transponder code stream through. â€œIts Admiral Saycho sir!â€ The recruit opens the link.
Admiral Saycho`s image comes into view. His uniform in near perfect order his stance strong and confident. Behind the Admiral a tan planet can be seen along with many bridge officers working their various stations. You know he would normal only communicate directly with Captain Prewart, but protocol would route to your station being the only officer with a working communications system.
In an abrupt voice the Admiral orders â€œReport!â€

â€œSir I have a visual on the Adjudicator on screen now sir.â€ The recruit punches up his feed onto the main screen. A triangular image, representing the Adjudicator, has smaller icons, representing fighters, moving rapidly across the destroyers surface. â€œShe is still there but I am picking up multiple contacts. The Adjudicator is under attack sir.â€ ***Yes, thank you. I gathered that from the muffled explosions…*** Naryen reads over the naval reports from the Adjudicator. Damage & threat assessments, read outs, reports, communication displays, anything of use at all. As her eyes roam over the screen an uncomfortable yet familiar sensation starts to build.
Naryen suppresses the shock that begins to wash over her. **"Give me a summary on those fighters! How many? What are they? Where did they come from?"** This is new territory for her and so something new now occurs to her **"And give me any report you have on what was causing those explosions."** A spiraling feeling begins to set in ***… is it possible?***
â€œDuegar squad is reporting slow progress into the city and the Greenbacks are still reporting large numbers of civilians coming in.â€ ***As good as can be expected.*** Across his screen you see Admiral Saycho`s personal transponder code stream through. â€œIts Admiral Saycho sir!â€ The recruit opens the link.
In an abrupt voice the Admiral orders â€œReport!â€
Naryen snaps to attention and salutes and, speaking to his chin as custom for a subordinate **"Sir! Yes sir! Civilians are being secured from areas effected by explosions. Lethal force was being used but I recinded that order and the Lt responsible for ordering the deaths of Imperial Citizens is now under guard. There are still reports of riots coming in but,"** Naryen allows some distaste to enter her town for this part **"I'm confident that since our troopers are no longer trying to kill them that will eventually subside. We were tracking a ship from Varltpin that was aprantly transporting terrorists here to Varlbrindal. Assuming that they haven't been killed by our own troopers, so they couldn't be interrogated, they are still at large."** Her distaste would now be evident on her face.
She takes a breath & clears her expression as she begins to report on that which was previously outside her scope. **"We have just now lost contact with the Adjudicator. It appears that she has been engaged by multiple fighters and they have managed to, at least, disable her com systems."** She then breaks protocol and looks at the Admirals eyes with a slight scowl and hessitantly offers **"It appears to be a coordinated effort, Varlbrin and Adjudicator. I wasn't aware that the terrorists had become so sophisticated. Your orders sir?"**

The Admiral listens to your report. Behind him bridge officers announce status reports.
-â€œthe shuttle is in position sir!â€
-â€œWe have twelve hostiles on our scans sir!â€
-â€œJabba has acknowledged our delay and is already making arrangements for a later meeting sir!â€
Around you the recruits fall silent, they continue working on your last request but listen intently for the Admirals response.
His expression never changes his voice direct and to the point. â€œInitiate order twenty one, report directly to me in one hour.â€ Without a salute or and form of acknowledgement that you understood your orders the Admiral ends the transmission.
The three recruits sit staring at you. Mouths hung open they await your command. On one of the sub monitors you see troopers begin to open fir on the civilians within the administrative building. Your tag on your parents shows them together and alone in a small cell together.
Order 21
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

((This is the short version))
With the current commanding officer unattainable in a hostile situation a mobile command is to be established with the highest ranking imperial officer available. With imperial assets at risk against unknown hostiles in a time of war all available resources must be spent to pacify the situation. Martial law dictates that imperial hardware takes priority.
When the hostile force or forces are unknown then lethal force will be administered on all non military targets. The order to cleanse the population will simultaneously be delivered to the highest ranking imperial officer and the entire commanded forces.
This level of authorization will only be issued via the emperors direct consent.

Naryen stares at the now dead com with wide, and significantly cooled, eyes and a face without expression. Images and reports she reviewed then put aside came crashing back in her mind. Denials she told herself smashed apart like anything facing a juggernaught would. Watching the screen, hearing the screams of the dying she also hears the screams of dying Wookies. Each shot, each impact, each gargle, like a bad audio dub job.
Screaming.
She lifts her PDA to the screen and dumps the main com core to it. This is, of course, the first step in executing the order to establish a mobile command.
Through the master com interface she taps into the same band used to disperse order 21, Naryen says "All units gather the civilians into easily accessible areas per our orders." then closes the channel. Then she taps her com **"Sims take command of both Duegar and Greenback and work to gather the populace to easily accessible areas per our orders. Since Lt Prine has identified himself as unreliable please dispose of him accordingly so you can get to it. We don't want anyone or anything getting in our way."**
She taps over to Sgt Lars. **"Lars to me. On the bounce, Sims will relieve you. Bring a Charriot with you."**
Naryen turns to the recruits, **"Lock out your stations and get out."** she pauses then looks around at the recruits **"If any of you have any family here,"** she pauses again then swallows, hard against a dry throat, **"do it yourself. Go! Now!"** She waits for them to scramble out.
Once the dump is complete she sets the security and power on diagnostic loops. ***Must secure these ground systems from any rebel tampering mustn't we? There is, after all, far more of them than us… but that's changing…***
Screaming.

The data streams to your pad as the situation sinks in. Training guides you now training the recruits obviously lack as they sit with vacant expressions across their faces.
-Sims â€œSims here sir! Dispose of the Lt yes sir!â€ From outside the control room you hear a single shot then silence.
-Lars: At first there is no response but static from your Sgt. Then just as you where about to give up Thomas comes over the com. â€œSorry Naryen I hate to do this to you â€¦ but this is not the empire I signed up for. You can try and stop me if you must but I am saving as many as I can.â€ Through the com you hear powerful engines powering up. As the commands systems fizzle and short out your data pad indicates a single lunch. Your view from the tower confirms this. â€œConsider this my resignation, Lars out.â€ The com goes dead from his end.
Leaving the recruits to a harsh realism you enter the corridor. The scene from the monitors did not display the madness with the correct level of justice. The screaming seems to intensify, rifle shots echo through the halls. Lt Prines body lays disposed where he was shot in the corridor. The troopers left him there in an attempt to be more efficient while they carry out order twenty one.
Is this the peace the emperor promised? Is this valor?

***Screaming.***
For the first time in this entire affair Naryens mouth hangs open. Up to this moment it was shock fueled trained reflex allowing her to mentally survive. She looks off to one side, past the walls and ceiling, swearing she can feel the vibrations from a direction as that craft lifts off. Imagined interpretation of the tremors that have started to take her body.
Her finger, absently, lifts from the last keystroke that triggered the self destruct command for the comm & control systems and all their redundancies. As the terminals squeal and spark the rising smoke and sharp ozone scent rapidly fills the room. The leftovers will be easily removed, and new units replaced, but what's there now is a totally useless molten mass. Determined these Imperials are about their information systems. Naryen stands oblivious to it all.
Then something changes deep in the back of her mind, a decision she had made months ago steps up and takes over. The emotions she kept in check speak out like the burn muscles gets when not used for some time. Her face twists in a sharp feral snarl. Her shoulders square up and her head snaps forward and eyes clench shut. Her hands start to shake while gripping the portable. Knuckles turn white and one of them pops under the strain as her hands try to strangle the portables casing.
After a moment, seconds at most, a single breath escapes her pursed lips as she relaxes her grip one digit at a time and opens her eyes to find shes now looking at the floor.
Her left hand locks the portable for transport as her right draws her pistol and keys off the safety setting to lethal in a smooth and practiced motion. Then her eyes snap up to her reflection in the dias in front of her in an expression of naked rage. The voice that follows is the same several times over. **"Traitor!"** deep, passionate, hearfelt, and totally directed internally, it escaped her strained lips like an expletive.
The place she saw her face reflected, the look of enraged disgust, is now a smoldering hole. Her own face still shows the same. She lowers her arm, after having shot the poor screen, and stalks towards the door stoping at the threshold. She turns to the recruit still standing stupified at the terminal nearest the door. Naryen idley wonders if he'll starve to death standing there. Her nose curls even further **"What!?"** With a grunt of further disgust she snaps her head away and steps into the corridor.
Seeing Prines corpse in the hall, the smell of his emptied bowels reaching her nose. ***…Wonder if he had the presense of mind to soil himself before his death did it for him… probably not.*** Naryen further recalls some ancient text she read once about... karma? then sets out at a run down the hall, passion fueling her.
***If only I'd confided in him, I was so busy trying not to show any doubts to my superiors I forgot the closest person I had to a friend. I'm such a traitor! Tom I'm so sorry! Perhaps I can make it up to you some day. For now though I have others I need to make amends to.***
She passes more corpses, some of them children, and their respective stinks of death. Faces in shocked expressions of pain and betrayal. Discarded like so much used equipment, disposed of so that someone else doesn't play with them. Playthings.
Passing a pair of troopers, checking over some corpses freshly shot to make sure they got them all as they fell, a smile spreads across her face. She salutes with her pistol off her forhead as she starts to giggle and sing out a favoured childhood rhyme to herself over and over.
**Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my toys to break.
So none of the other kids can use 'em…
Amen.**

The chaos around you mirrors the turmoil inside you. All you ever knew all you ever where has changed. The madness continues around you as if in a haze. Peoples screams and crys for mercy are only answered by the troopers blasters. With thoughts of your home world to mind what it was whatever it will become you race down the stairs.
Bodies lay dead throughout the main building as you enter was once was a public space terminal. A few troopers pick through the bodies ensuring the effectiveness of their executed orders. Two troopers guarding the door stand and salute you as you enter.
No one was spared men women, old and young. The terminals main entry way is littered with your own people. Many of the side rooms are open, having been used as temporary holding cells you can imagine that the troopers have already finished those rooms. Several of the side room are still closed. Two troopers open an door and fire into the room. More screams then silence.

So many bodies so many dead. How many did you know how many did you go to school with sat with on public transit? How many are you, where you related to? Many of the bodies, the kills are recent. The blast wounds still smolder among the dead.
Why?
Entering the closest side room, the room marked earlier you stop in your tracks. Too stunned at first to react you stand within the doorway for some time trying to make sense of the scene before you. Inside the room only a man and woman lay. The man hunched over the woman in a vein attempt to protect her from the onslaught. Both lay dead now.

Her Father looked to have moved to protect her Mother and was gunned down first. Just as the shock registered her mother was ended. ***How wonderfully clinical you monster…***
Naryens chest tightened with a hiss and her eyes widen with shock just as the smell of death reached her nose and registers. The screaming in her mind now distorts into a relentless crashing that shakes her knees. She curls around her stomach as it heaves, collapsing with a grunt, as if from a gut-punch. Naryen somehow still manages to stare at the vacant eyes and pained expressions on faces of her parents corpses as tears ran down her face. A wrenching moan tears from her gut and escapes from her strained mouth as a whimper. She closes her eyes, hangs her head and sobs freely.
When she opens her eyes, some time later, she is staring, unseeing, at the floor with half closed eyes. ***How many people have I betrayed? How many oaths have I taken but have been, in fact, hollow? What have I done!?*** The sense of loss starts to overwhelm her again, everything she fought so hard for, that her parents worked so hard for, is lost.
In a puddle of her tears she sees an image, a face flushed with efort and pain, a face she doesn't recognize. She stares taking in the sight for a moment. A face she hasn't really seen before. Something deep in her mind stirs and she closes her eyes ***If I allow myself to be lost here, then they are lost for nothing… I will not let their passing mean nothing… I need to hurry!*** She uncurls herself to a standing position then opens her eyes, taking in her reflection then looks at her parents husks. She speaks in a very low voice "I'm sorry." then rushes out the door.
Naryen pulls out the PDA and unlocks it and queries the Spaceport Registry for the remaining craft. She checks 1st for any Imperial Courier or similar ships.

The data pad blinks to life still connected to the existing relay network. Outside the terminal doors dozens of ships are attempting to flee. Some are taking fire from anti-aircraft weapons that rain blaster blots from unknown positions within the city. A few ships have been downed but many more are preparing to launch.
Hordes of local citizens rush to the remaining ships while a few troopers attempt to maintain order. Firing into the crowds many more die, its complete chaos. Some of the locals run past you giving you looks of horror. In the buildings windows your reflection shows your polished imperial uniform, this might make in harder to get aboard a private ship.
Your data pad indicates that your shuttle has landed on the Adjudicator. You still have no communication with the star destroyer and only a beacon locator form the shuttle. The only other ships in range are the local ships trying to flee the planets surface.

Naryen starts to feel light-headed, going from a room thick with death to a major corridor thick with the panicked and dying. The throng of people giver her the impression of being swept. When she turns away for a moment the sight of a prim and proper imperial officer, looking like she is about to puke, is staring back at her. Realization sets in again. ***No, that's a scared child wearing clothes too big for her.*** The face hardens. ***There I am. Move!***
She gets her bearings back, for one of the too many building she spent more time in than her own quarters, and sets out to the closest Maintenance & Utility sections to "procure" something else to wear. Naryen mentally disregards 2 that are too close to the clearly overwhelmed troopers and 1 that is too far away then sets off in a flat run away from the crush of flesh and fear. ***I need to change then get to a ship in as short a distance as possible… I wish I could do more but I'd draw attention to myself that would cost more lives! Congratulations on your promotion!***
When Naryen gets to the locker room she checks around for any sign of troopers, including using the PDA survelance setup, then swipes in and grabs a set of overalls & toolbelt to which she adds her sidearm concealed in a pouch. She decides it best to undress and fold up her uniform into an inside pouch of the overalls. After Naryen is dress she sets back out to the ship pads for any ship taking large numbers she can hide in.
***Such a brave officer…***

The service room provides a suitable disguise in the way of a janitors overall. A size too large it has ample room to hold your personal belongings. With all the chaos you are free and uninterrupted in your conversion into civilian. Another check on your stowed personal belongings and you set off outside once again.
The crowds of citizens become too much for the limited number of troopers. In overwhelming numbers the crowdâ€™s envelope the troopers. Before you several more ships begin preflight for there escape runs. A large passenger liner the Star of Cerea is closest. The Botajef Freighter-liner has the means to transport thousands. Her crews are currently waving people inside from the many lowered boarding ramps.
The crowd almost carries you forward with the current. All the ramps are open even the cargo hold. The ships crews are insisting that all leave behind their personal affects to spare room for as many as possible. Rushed inside most huddle together, for many its standing room only. You find a seating area within a large circular view port. It gives you a view of the landing zones and some elbow room.
The ship shakes as it launches and the ground quickly fades from view as the ship rockets into space. In orbit dozens of ships made it off the surface as well. The ships begin setting course away from Varlbrindal. You view allows you one last look at you home world are you are ferried away to safety. Also in orbit the Adjudicator sits with her nose pointed at the planet. The command tower little more then a crater, she was hit hard in the assault. You find no signs of the speedy fighters you saw from the command center.
Around you many of the citizens are looking at you whispering amongst each other and pointing at you. Scared your cover might be blown you try to cover your face as much as possible by looking down then you here their comments.
-â€œThatâ€™s an officerâ€™s pistol.â€
-â€œShe must have killed one.â€
-â€œHero, she is a hero!â€
Cheers break out in your section of the ship. Word spreads quickly throughout the ship and many wave and cheer when they see you. Itâ€™s not long before the ship enters Hyper space. The crew informs everyone that the best course would be Tatooine. Less of an imperial presence and it is only a few days travel.

Making like a sardine in a Botajef Freighter-liner named the Star of Cerea.
Feeling the crush of people Naryen almost revels in the moment of abandon, feeling the life and energy around her, a sharp contrast to the death she had just experiened. She watched the crowd overcome and likely kill the troopers. ***So be it. Shooting unarmed civilians as they flee for their lives your life is forfeit.*** She stoops forward slightly alowing her hair to fall on either side of her face and remains that way. Through the crush of people crammed into an area much to small for the head count, Naryen finds herself near a window.
She watches the hulk of the Adjudicator with a look of pained hope. With her hands and head lowered Naryen reaches into her overalls & disables the wireless on her PDA then notices an unusual amount of attention being paid to her. She acts shy and awkward (***How does someone my age act shy!?***) in an attempt to distract from her. The soreness from her new posture is starting to set in on her upper back.
Then she hears the whispers. -â€œThatâ€™s an officerâ€™s pistol.â€ Her face drops & goes pale and she quickly covers her pistol in it's pouch more securely ***Oh no…*** -â€œShe must have killed one.â€ -â€œHero, she is a hero!â€ ***… that didn't take long. Kill an imperial, become a hero… time to become a murderer I guess.*** She looks back out the window just as the ship enters Hyperspace and treacherous tears wet her face. She wipes her face almost violently.
Soon after, announcements are made about distribution of a modest supply of Imperial rations the captain was transporting but didn't get a chance to unload. Knowing that the hollow sick feeling would only get worse without food Naryen set out to the Galley. The crush of people actually felt reasuring, until she notices the occasional brightened expression when they see her face. ***Great, stay in the Imperial Military and get called a hero for killing civilians. Be a nobody that kills an Imperial officer and be a hero. Why do heroes have to be killers?***
In the hallway connecting Naryens section to the Galley there are many refugees, some whole family units by the look of them. This lightens Naryens mood until she considers how many must have died and may still be dying. The memories of the atrocities she has witnessed bubble to the surface with the new clarity of hindsight. Her darkened mood doesn't allow her to notice the handful of people that recognize her and move aside.
In the Galley, hearing the cries of children likely devestated over the loss of a parent or family member since the wounded were routed to another section, Naryen takes a few ration packs from the attendant, ignoring the noticable brightening of his scaley facing, and turns to leave. A little girl, somewhere between diapers and puberty, stands in her way. Light brown hair in curls around her face and shoulders, grey-green eyes an a simple orange dress clutching a toy that looks to be in the image of southern glacier Wind Riders, an avian hunter from Varlbrindal.
With a hessitant demeanor and fiddling hands on her toy the little girl says "What's your name?" The childs voice is musical and devoid of animosity or fear. ***Amazing!***
With a smile Naryen kneels down. The clamour of room falls to a hush she ignores. **"Deidra. What's yours?"** Naryen changes the pitch of her voice slightly.
"Lahela." She cocks her head to one side and with a bright smile. "Did you really kill an Imperial Officer?" The glee and excitement in the childs voice is infectious to the people around her as they visibly brighten. The childs eyes practically bulge with the hope to the answer.
Naryens head pulls back as that question, from such a young mouth & mind, registers and the agast epxression comes across Naryens face. She now notices the fine blood spatter on one side of Lahelas dress and her toy. ***Is this what the Emperor wants? Generations of blood thirsty enemies bent on mutual destruction and death!*** Naryen took a breath, cleared her throat, and pitched her voice to carry, a trick from her officer training, for the now much quieter room.
**"I suprised an officer who was looking over some bodies."** Naryen allows her face to twist with the memory of her dead parents and lets her voice crack as her eyes look at the floor. **"She was crying over them, perhaps she knew them, and it gave me a chance to suprise her so I could take her uniform and get out alive."**  Naryen let out a sigh then looked up at the child. **"I'm not proud of ending someone before she may have had a chance to fully realize her error but an Imperial Officer uniform seemed a good way not to get killed."**
Naryen sighed again then smiled and looked up at Lahela's face. Seeing her disapointment for Naryens less than enthusiastic response she tries to distract the child saying **"Are you Hungry?"**  And extends her right hand offering Lahela a ration pack. A child so excited at killing has further soured Naryens appetite.
Lahelas face and nose twists in as close a look of disgust a face so young could show. "Ew! It's Imperial!"
In a move of such rapid violence, that would suprise her later, Naryen grabs the Imperial emblem with her other hand and with a pinch-twist rips it off the ration pack and holds it up to face Lahela **"There"** casts it aside dramatically for the audience. **"now it's just a ration pack."**
Lahela practically bounces with glee and a growl from her little stomach "Yay, thank-you!" She takes the pack and turns, Naryen now forgotten, and walks away chewing the bar and humming to herself.
Naryen stands and looks around the room. Faces that were joyous at the idea of her killing someone now turn away in embarassment.
Naryen hangs her head so her hair hides her smile and walks out of the galley to the area assigned for caring for the walking wounded. ***Time to put some Imperial training to constructive use for a change!*** The smile is replaced by her determined expression, though her posture would deny that, and she makes her way through the sobbing and exhausted masses cramed into the Star of Cerea like so many steri-sealed ration packs.

Over the next few days Lahela tags along with you. You learn that she is an orphan, something she now has in common with many other children on board. Some of the adults have taken it upon themselves to watch over them in shifts but Lahela choice to follow you most anywhere you go.
The next few days are uneventful if not crowded. The ships crew does its best to keep everyone happy with the quickly diminishing supplies and Varlbrindal is but a bad memory. Though many still look at you with respect the survivors have stopped calling you hero, probably for the best the attention was making you uncomfortable. You have been sleeping in the view port ledge where you watched the Adjudicator while Laheala has been sleeping on a nearby crate.
Just before the announcement you can see Tatooine come into view. â€œThis is your captain speaking we have arrived. We will be landing shortly this will all be over soon.â€ A backwater planet inhabited by Hutts among other less reputable races Tatooine has been noted to be one of the galaxies most prosperous holes. You remember from your training a small garrison is stationed within the city of Bestine but the Hutts retain overall control over the planet.
A familiar triangular shape comes into view itâ€™s the Illustrious. From the angle of her approach she has taken a standard attack/boarding maneuver. The Illustrious moves in quickly to close the distance between the two ships. Several crewmen enter your section, they all look worried. Moving to each escape pod they ignore the passengers questions while they ready each pod one by one.
Confused the area explodes with unanswered questions, Lahela squeezes your hand and looks up into your eyes â€œWhats happing?â€ As if in a cruel answer to her question the Illustrious opens fire on the Star of Cerea knocking many to the ships florr. Sirens erupt throughout the ship while many of the passengers begin screaming.

Cramed into a passenger compartment of a Freighter-liner named the Star of Cerea.
Just short of nodding off Naryen looks up as the Star of Cerea exits HP and then reorients towards a light brown, or tan, colored planet. The swirl of the stars, as the ship changes direction, causes her stomach to lurch slightly. With a stretch of an arched back and a small grunt Naryen looks over to the crate where Lahela lies asleep. The child, curled up around her prized toy, Chillzer, has a calm almost blissful smile on her face.
A warm, relaxed, not quite so alien as it used to be, smile spreads across Naryens face. There were precious few people with injuries to assist, a testament to well trained troopers, so she was thankful for the distraction Lahela provided. The childs energy and inquisitive nature kept Naryen engaged and they shared a few moments, recalling lost family, that helped each other a great deal. Thankfully Lahelas curiousity was focused almost entirely on the ship and exploring it with Naryen. A welcome distraction as most paid most attention to bouncing little girl.
Â“This is your captain speaking we have arrived. We will be landing shortly this will all be over soon.Â” The announcement starts Lahela and she stirs, yawns and looks up. Her face splits into with an imediate smile and Naryen realizes she is smiling back with relaxed enthusiasm. ***Perhaps there is hope.***
Several crewmen enter their section through various accesspoints all looking and acting very anxious and hurried. This gets the attention of many people, including Naryen whose smile fades as her eyes sharpen. Questions are asked by the refugees and the tension escalates, as the questions go unanswered, especially as they start prepping escape pods! Naryens smile snaps away as if never existed and her an expressionless face & eyes scan the face of every crewmember with near feral intensity. ***There isn't going to be enough pods if we need them.***
She looks out the viewport and sees an ISD approaching in an boarding posture! ***If we get boarded they'll just start shooting the civ … us again*** Her eyes widen at the thought then she feels a preasure on her right hand. Naryen turns and finds herself looking into Lahelas eyes, wide with fear. The wonderfully aware child picked up on the tension immediately & her voice already starts to shake with fear as she asks Â“Whats happing?Â”
Though she's at a loss for words Naryen opens her mouth to answer but squeezes Lahelas hand back, trying to provide any reasurance she can. The ledge she's been using as a bunk suddenly drops out from underneath Naryen and her elbow strikes the edge of the viewport forcing their hands apart. As the crate Lahela is on tips to one side, her arms flail about and she lets out a squeal of fear and falls out of sight. *Screaming.*
The viewport then slams up into Naryens side forcing a pained grunt from her though not winding her. She unclenches her eyes to witness flashes from the ISDs batteries, that she now recognizes, ***Illustrious! Admiral Saycho!*** as the rest of it's opening salvo illuminates the compartment she is in. The sound of tearing bulkheads and failing substructure, both close and far away, vibrate through the ship and her body. The lights in the compartment flicker out to be replaced with emergency backups and evacuation alarms sound and the escape pods come to life.
She snaps her head back, eyes wide, and nearly screams **"Lahela!"** Pulling herself out of the viewport she looks into the now rumbling compartment. The calm of before has been replaced with a panicked crush. People of all different kinds are falling upon each other in a scramble for their lives. Lahela is nowhere in sight. Naryen sees & picks up & crams Chillzer into a pouch on her overalls, in a single lunge, heading to the closest escape pod pushing past people as the run scrambling, pushing, tearing, screaming. Trapped and taken by beastial panic. **"Lahela!"** Now the strain shows in Naryens voice.
"Deidra!" Somehow over the screaming of the people, the alarms, and the crash of failing ship structures Naryen hears Lahelas voice. Strained. Terrified. So much fear at losing someone close to her. Again. The childs voice mirrors the pain and fear that now drives Naryen towards her. *Screaming*
In the mob, the next pod over, Naryen sees Lahela clutched painfully in the arms of a man with a look of wild unfocused panic in his green eyes, tearing into the people about him with unseeing fury with his free arm and legs. His light brown hair and pale complexion makes the blood trickling from his mouth stand out all the more. Naryen considers that the blood isn't his. His arm shifts and Lahela lets out a pained gasp as it presses across her chest and colorbone. His arm suddenly shifts across her neck and Naryens and Lahelas eyes meet as the arm presses down. Lahela twists with all the strength she has in her little frame struggling for her very life-breath as the preasure from his arm increases.
Naryen crosses now shapeless, undulating, faceless mass, to the only sight in the universe that matters, in a blur. She grabs the crazed mans arm and twists it off Lahelas neck as she puts her other arm around her small torso. He shivers and twists away as Lahela lets out a scream of gasping determination and wraps all her limbs around Naryen with painful strength. The man looks back at Naryen, no sign of anything beyond crazed fear, as an elbow comes across the side of his head and he falls to the crush with a sound that could have been described as a scream of pained insane frustration if it came from a non-human throat.
Lahelas grip tightens at the sound as Naryen twists away an back towards the first Pod, somehow fitting ahead of so many and then the crush carries her forward into the pod. The other pod fills up rapidly, well beyond it's capacity. Naryen curls up around Lahela as the little girl starts to sob and shake with fear and exhaustion. Naryen wraps an arm around her and tries to move to allow for more space, finding herself near the front of the pod looking out into space where she can see the Illustrious and Tatooine.
*Screaming*

The screams of the passengers and the protest of the ships bulkheads as the resist bombardment from the Illustrious is almost deafening. You hold the escape pods hatch open screaming for survivors to find salvation within. Fire engulfs the large cabin, gravity begins to fail as the ship begins to break apart.
Sensing the danger you smash the auto launch button. The hatch slams shut and the pod explodes into space the jolt forces Lahelas head against the pods wall. Checking her vitals she is out just a fresh bump on her head, she struggles with the seat harness. Through the single view port you can see other pods racing to the surface of Tatooine.
A hail of turbo laser fire surrounds the area the pod next to you explodes, its hull slams against your pod sending your pods trajectory astray. The planet begins to dominate the view port the tan planet becomes a blur. Racing through the planets atmosphere you lose all track of the remaining escape pods. With a hard thump your pod hits the desert floor. Disorientated you struggle to regain focus. Lahelas rests soundly in her seat safe but unconscious for the moment.

From the frying pan&#8230;
Naryen watches with wide eyes as the crush of crazed and panicked people try to press into the other pods, but not one person towards hers. ***There's room in here!*** Naryen screams with everything she has **"IN HERE!"** just as the far wall buckles like some crazed beast busting through the walls. She can't hear the sound of her own voice over the screach of metal tearing away from supports. Flame and shockwaves rush into the compartment blasting tables crates and other debris into lethal shrapnel spinning into the mob and towards the opening of her escape pod.
With a desperate lunge Naryen turns away from the death throes of the Star of Cerea, curling around Lahela, and smashes the auto launch button. The hatch slams shut and the pod explodes into space with a jolt that forces Lahelas head against the pods wall. Naryen feels the jolt through the childs little body and checks her over quickly. She's unconsious, probably more from the shock than the little bump on the head, but otherwise ok. Naryen straps her into a descent harness and then herself.
A shaking sigh of relief escapes from Naryens pursed mouth just as the escape pod lurches and twists into a hard spin. The sound of the pods hull buckling and tearing from an impact rings through Naryens skull as the console starts a tantrum of lights and sound protesting some considerable mistreatment. She clenches her eyes shut as the spin continues and she is pressed into her seat as the feeling of vertigo, imposed by the interial damper, washes over and takes hold. ***Must have gotten struck by something. If the re-entry shield has been damaged then this is our coffin.*** Naryen tries & fails to turn against the forces on her body to look at Lahela. ***Drop training was never like this!***
As the light from the viewport intensifies and changes color from re-entry Naryen realizes that the air in the pod is getting warmer. Fast. She opens her eyes to take in the color change. The pod starts to buck wildly as a new axial spin is introduced and Naryen is thrashed around within the harness. With slow the slow reaction of the intertial dampener and the consoles continued griping through seemingly useless caution lights and beeping she closes her eyes against the chaos. With gut wrenching jolt the intertial dampener gives it's last to counter what otherwise would have been a lethal impact and the feeling of vertigo stops cold.
Naryen opens her eyes to an interior only lit by a blinking red light from the console, that has thankfully stopped whining, and releases her harness. With her head still spinning Naryen doesn't realize that the pod is positioned end in the air with her upside down and she tumbles from her seat into another across from her. She tightens her stomach to keep from vomitting and shakes her head to try to clear it, imediately regretting it.
With a series of controlled breaths she repositions and stands to attend to Lahela, pushing through the dizziness that threatens to overcome her. Steady breathing and no obvious bone damage. A hint of a smile flashes across Naryens face ***Slept through that huh?* "Lucky girl."**. Naryen pulls a couple of survival kits from under the seats and opens the hatch seal. It breaches with a pop and hot dry dusty air blasts into Naryens face. With the escape pod now lit she scrounges the pod for anything else useful and gives Lahela, and herself, a thorough checking over in the light.
