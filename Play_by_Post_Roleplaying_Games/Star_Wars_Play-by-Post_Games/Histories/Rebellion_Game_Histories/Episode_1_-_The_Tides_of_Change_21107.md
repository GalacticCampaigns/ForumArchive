# Episode 1 - The Tides of Change

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-12 13:07:21)

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…
<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">**Star Wars: A Different Shade of Evil**</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">**Episode I - The Tides of Change**</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">Darkness engulfs the Galaxy. Barely five years after the act of treachary that brought the end of the Republic, freedom has almost become a faded memory.
Spreading across known space, the evil GALACTIC EMPIRE rules all with an iron fist, sweeping aside all vestiges of liberty, and replacing it with tyranny and oppression.
In these dark times, often all people have is hope. The REBEL ALLIANCE strives to reward that hope. Rebel operatives have journeyed to the ocean world of Manaan, where they hope to liberate the Selkath and inspire a new generation of heroes to join the cause, and help restore peace and justice to the galaxy&#8230;</span>
In the glow of Manaan's sun, it seems hard to believe that this is a conquered world. From the outside, the floating metropolis of Ahto City seems unchanged from the days of old. Off-worlders of all kinds continue to live and work there as they always have. If one ignores the Acclamator cruiser parked on the ocean surface nearby like a sinister overseer, they could be fooled that things were fine... at least for a while.
Scratch the surface of life in Ahto City and a very different story would be told. Times are tough for those who do not agree with the Imperial regime and the changes it has brought about. Lacking the resources to do anything about it, the people cope as best they can, secretly hoping and praying for change to come.
Little do they, or their Imperial overlords, realise that theirs prayers are about to be answered...
**Central Spaceport - just outside Docking Bay A16**
Even amid the hum of engines, the clanging of tools, and the various complaints of workers trying to do several things at once, the loud bellow of an angry Wookiee is going to travel a long way, and draw a lot of attention.
Anyone looking for the source of the bellow will quickly catch sight of a towering brown-furred Wookiee wearing a bandolier and a backpack shouting and gesticulating at a trio of men in Czerka uniforms while a figure wearing a white hooded cloak looks on.
Despite the obvious rage of the Wookiee, the Czerka operatives are standing their ground, and almost appear to be trying to shout the Wookiee down, something that most sane people wouldn't even consider...

**North-East Sector - Inside the Last Refuge**
The Last Refuge could be said to be very aptly named. With the Imperials and Czerka in control of much of the city, non-humans are excluded more and more, but not here. Here at the Last Refuge it is humans who are out of place.
Dimly lit, the cantina is nevertheless quite cosy. The northern edge is dominated by the bar, behind which the Gran proprietors of the establishment work cheerfully, serving their customers with a smile and conversation.
A Cerean and a Bothan sitting at the bar seem to be enjoying that aspect of the service.
A simple door in the middle of the south wall leads back to the city itself. It opens every so often to admit another patron wishing to escape the drudgery of everyday toil or the omnipresent Imperials.
To either side of the cantina are a number of tables, five on each side, with at least one sentient sat at each. Most have groups engaged in boistrous conversation.

Buckaradon Carcharias has just arrived at the cantina, the athletic Nautolan stands with his back to the bar, with his fresh liter of ale. In doing so he has shut himself off from the Gran barkeeps and their stool bound guests' conversation. He peers over the tables, hoping one will empty, wanting to sit and reflect on his day of fighting bureaucratic red tape for a real job. He has less than 100 credits to his name, and rent will be due soon. So far gambling has proven to be good way flash burn credits, he's better off drinking his credits. He thinks *something has got to give*.
Descriptionn of Buckaradon Carcharias:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Mottled greenish grey skin with shark like eyes. His tendrils have blue tattooed rings about 3cm tall halfway down. He is fit and toned, wearing a tight fitting blue with green trim flight suit. The coat of his flight suit is half unzipped, showing a tight fitting orange shirt. His utility belt is green with black. His boots are designed for heavy work opposed to those normally on flight suits and his gloves are modified combat and work gloves. On his left boot is his hunting knife in its holster. His helmet hangs on his belt on his left side. His BlasTech DH-17 is holstered on his right hip. He has a few scars, from growing up rough and tumble, giving him a bit of a predatory feel.

Natural light flooded into the Cantina for a moment as Elu entered through the door. He deftly manoeuvred towards the bar before lowering his hood, revealing his deep red skin tone and alien visage. After engaging in some uncomfortable small talk with the barmen Elu proceeded to find a seat where he could drink the newly acquired beverage. Ahto city was getting rather tiresome, he was hoping to make some progress soon...

Buck sighs, *This place will fill up before a table empties,* he thinks. He follows the recently arrived Kel Dor to whatever table he chose, he seemed to be keeping to himself, much like Buck. The Nautolan sits one seat over from the Kel Dor and further away from the others talking a the table if possible. He nods at the Kel Dor and the others as he sits. Visible frustration is apparent on Buck's face, as he sits and drinks contemplatively.

**Inside the Last Refuge**
As you look around, you will no doubt spot each other, as well as the rest of the patrons. Three of the tables have small groups of Quarren seated at them, two have Twi'lek couples, one is occupied by a Rodian and a Devaronian, two by Trandoshans and Weequay, and one that catches your eye.
Seated at the table in question are a pair of Selkath, and a Barabel wearing a hooded robe. You notice that the Selkath seem furtive and nervous about speaking to this Barabel, though there is no obvious reason for such fear...
...until the door bursts open and six men in distinctive white armour and carrying oversized rifles march in.
"This is a raid!" one of the Stormtroopers shouts, "All of you xeno trash put your hands where we can see them and no funny business!"

### **Tempeste** (2008-11-12 18:12:02)

Elu quickly turns towards the Stormtroopers as they walk in, He slowly raises his arms whilst glancing at the Nautolan nearby. *This wasn't good… The Empire seemed to look down on non-humans and here was a bar full of them.*
"What is your business here?" He calmly asked the forward most stormtrooper whilst raising his hood to cover himself.

Kelvin walks around quietly in the spaceport area. He thinks of how he is to help the Selkath free their world. Kelvin's thoughts are abruptly interrupted by a wookie, causing quite a ruckess.
Kelvin, watching the czerka struggle trying to shut the wookie up, goes over and says to the czerka workers "hello, what's the problem here?"

### **Anazider** (2008-11-12 18:21:57)

Sajin slowed his gait as he neared the enraged Wookie, making sure to give the budding skirmish a wide birth. The Nagaian was conscious of the Czerka corps agents, particularly of the man in the white cloak at their head, but he made sure to give no noticeable indication as to his reticence.
The same scene was being played out in different starports on different worlds across the galaxy, and he had been privy to no small handful of such spectacles. The Empire seemed to delighted in flexing its muscles where they already held sway, and much was the case here. Sajin helped where he could, but held little respect for those that did not see fit to defend themselves, or their honor.
*Besides*, the Nagaian thought, *Full grown Wookies tend to have little trouble in forcing others to see reason.*

**Central Spaceport**
"Stay out of this, kid" one of the Czerka agents says nastily, all but ignoring you as he turns back to the Wookiee.
"Shout all you want, hairball, but you're not getting near that ship of yours. That weapons loadout is far too much for a civilian freighter. You should count yourself lucky that the Empire hasn't impounded *you* too"
That threat draws more bellowing from the Wookiee, and a soft feminine giggle from the white-robed figure.
"There must be some mistake" she says gently, delicate hands rising to push back her hood, revealing a beautiful face and cascading blonde hair.
"You found no reason to impound this ship"
For a moment, the Czerka agents' eyes gloss over and they repeat "We found no reason to impound this ship"
**Inside the Last Resort**
"Who are you to question us?" the lead trooper demands, "The Empire doesn't answer to sub-human trash like you"
He then raises his voice, addressing everyone in the room.
"You are all under arrest for charges of sedition, and harbouring a known fugitive. You can either come quietly, or we stun you all and drag you outside. What's it going to be?"

The young woman smiles enigmaticly, then closes her eyes for a few moments. Her brow creases as if she is in deep thought, and then she opens her eyes again.
"I think it might be best if we discussed this somewhere more private, don't you?" she asks genty.
"I'm Arrisa, this is Hrabacca. What's your name?"

### **Anazider** (2008-11-12 19:15:47)

Sajin's eyes narrow slightly as he gazes at the woman for the briefest of moments. Hitching his rucksack, the Nagaian uses the gesture to cover the motion of his hand as he checks the positioning of his lightsaber in his hidden holster.
Regaining his stride, Sajin continues move by the woman and the wookie, somewhat more hurriedly then he had before. The thought of the woman being a Jedi made him apprehensive, even more so then the thought of her being one of the Empire's inquisitors.
And such thoughts shamed the proud Nagaian, but it didn't make him hurry any less.

Kira, having taken a seat at the bar several hours ago, preferably in a convenient location from which to watch the door and rest of the bar, curses to herself as the Stromtroopers burst in, "Blast! I'm never going to escape the Empire!"
Kira makes a stealth check to slowly draw the blaster at her side and ready to shoot a Stormie, should one of them attempt to arrest her by force.

((Inside the Last Resort))
Kayle sat in one of the many secluded booths in the dark recesses of the bar. He nursed a tall, foaming glass of green lomiin-ale. He was wearing civilian clothes, and his jetpack. He had come to Manaan at the behest of his Alliance superiors. He was told that his new name was Jack, that he was a mercenary down on his luck, and that he was to lay low and wait for further instructions.
That was a month ago, and he was drinking the last credit that they had given him. Pretty soon, he was going to have to start hiring his blaster, just to stay alive. If something didn't come up soon...
He heard the disturbance first, then saw the glistening white plasteel suits. These anti-alien raids by the Imperial forces on Manaan were a pretty common occurance. He would just keep his seat, finish his drink, an watch them walk on...his thoughts were interrupted by the lead trooper. "You are all under arrest for charges of sedition and harboring a known fugitive..." The words froze his blood. How could they possibly know that he was here? He had been so careful, he hadn't contacted anyone, stayed off the Holonet. He rose from his seat with the other patrons of the Last Resort, who were now beginning the shuffle out the door. He put one hand on the grip of his pistol, resting in the holster on his thigh.
Well, he thought, I obeyed orders, I laid low. If I'm captured I can't complete my mission. We'll just see what happens.
OOC: Sorry I'm late. Long day in surgery, no internet access.

**Inside the Last Resort**
For now the Stormtroopers seem oblivious to the presence of two humans in a bar full of aliens, though that changes as Kayle stands up.
"A human getting pally with the xenos" one of them remarks, "Looks like that's an extra prize for us. Move"
Standing with an air of improbable calmness, the Barabel from one of the tables starts sissing with laughter.
"Only sixz?" she rasps, "This one isz almost insulted. You are not taking any of these innoszents, and you are certainly not taking this one any further than the door"
A stunned silence falls over the room as Stormtroopers and civilians alike try to work out what the Barabel is playing at...
**Central Spaceport**
"It's nice to meet you, Kelvin" Arrisa says warmly, "Have you been in Ahto City long? Do you think you could tell us some more of what the Empire has been up to?"

Buck knows a buncha guys here carry blasters. If things get rowdy, these stormtroopers are in for a surprise, especially if the others are as good as he is with them. He keeps drinking his ale, calmly, slowly. As the Barabel laughes, the Nautolan finishes his ale and slips his right hand under the table as he turns to look, as most everyone is. He draws his blaster pistol, keeping it under the table. He thinks, *This could get interesting or dangerous, probably both…*

In the last resort
Elu now walks forward until he is a few feet before the lead stormtrooper. He glances across the room before staring back at the stormtrooper.
"I'm afraid that won't be possible. The only criminals in this cantina are those standing behind you." He finished whilst motioning towards his stormtrooper squad. "Take another step and you'll make criminals of all of us..."

Arrisa offers a slight shrug.
"I guess that means we get to find out together" she says sweetly, "Do you want to come exploring with us?"
**Inside the Last Resort**
"Well that just makes it easier on us then" the lead trooper retorts, aiming his blaster rifle at Elu's chest, as another one spots Buck drawing his pistol.
"Take them all!"
(Initiative: Stormtroopers, Barabel, Kira, Buck, Patrons, Elu, Kayle)
The Stormtroopers immediately open fire, one at Elu, one at the mouthy Barabel, one at Buck and the other three at the nearest bar patrons.
A Trandoshan and two Weequay are hit by the stun blasts and dropped instantly.
Buck and Elu are also hit and sent sprawling (17 damage and 2 steps down the track for Elu, 9 damage and 2 steps down for Buck) but they aren't knocked out.
The Barabel surprises everyone by blocking the stun blast with the palm of her left hand.
"This one said you weren't taking these people anywhere" she rasps, then makes a pushing gesture with her left hand and reaches inside her cloak with her right.
As the trooper that shot her crashes into the one that shot Buck, her right hand emerges holding a cylinder of polished metal with what look like teeth tied to it. There is a loud snap-hiss and a green bar of plasma erupts from the other end of the cylinder...

Buck staggers a moment, and brings his left hand to his head as he shakes off the pain. *That hurt… but at least the odds just got better, I've never seen a light sword before…*
(Shake it Off, two swift actions)
Buck raises his DH-17 and fires off a stun round at the Stormtrooper with the least cover. He yells, "Take 'em out fast, before they call for help!" He hopes that rallies some of the slow to act in here.

The closest cover to Kira is the table nearest the bar.
Unfortunately her blast sails wide, scorching a black pit into the far wall instead of a trooper's chest.
Similarly, Buck also misses. The effects of that stun bolt are obviously still messing with him.
The rest of the patrons, bouyed by the presence of a Jedi, join in and start hurling things at the Imperials.
The barrage of drinks mugs, dinner plates, cutlery, and even a couple of chairs does little more than distract the troopers, but sometimes a distraction is all that is needed...

### **Anazider** (2008-11-14 13:30:40)

With the wookie and his female accompaniment behind him, Sajin continues onward, checking over his shoulder less and less the further into the docking bay he progresses.
The Ahto City space port was a bustle of activity, with merchant vessels loading and unloading prescious cargo for the city's continued vibrancy. But the liveliness of the spaceport seemed somehow muted. Small groups of Selkath and other mixed-species groups moved in huddled silence, while armed stormtrooper patrols prowled down each corridor.
Sajin mostly ignored it, wrapped up in his thoughts concerning the Jedi from earlier and a host of other memories that crept their way from the recesses of his mind. The apprehension he felt at her appearance made him feel a mixture of shame, and anger at the feeling of shame, but he tamped the feelings down under the calm veneer of personal discipline.
*There is city enough for the both of us*, he thought, *and I will likely never see that woman again.*

Elu stumbled back as the stunbolt smashed into his arm. He grimaced a little before moving into an offensive posture and striking the nearest stormtrooper.

Kayle heard the arrest order, and saw the strange weapon carried by the Barabel light up. "What the blazes..." He trailed off. The attitude in the room had shifted away from the Imperial Stormtroopers drastically. *Well,* he thought, *I can't slip out the back, if these folks are willing to stand up for me.*
The blaster pistol he carried whipped from its holster. He flipped one of the deserted tables and hunkered down behind it, drawing a bead on the stormtroopers.

"What the frack?" the lead Stormtrooper blurts out as Elu's fist rushes towards him, an attack that he slaps aside with the barrel of his rifle.
"A Jedi, trash throwing trash and now a guy bringing fists to a gunfight? Kriffing intel guys. Go for grenades"
Retreating, he fires again at Elu, while the two injured troopers hobble back out of the way, and the remaining three troopers unhook a stun grenade each from their belts and lob them towards the Barabel Jedi... and fail miserably to have any effect on her, or anyone else for that matter. And just in case that wasn't bad enough, the lead trooper somehow manages to miss Elu.
Sissing with laughter, the Barabel Jedi springs forward and neatly slashes her blade across the lead trooper's rifle, cutting it into four pieces.
"This one thinks you should leave while you still can" she says menacingly.
**Central Spaceport - Docking bay A-04**
"Hey, Sage" the familiar voice of Old Jack calls to you from nearby as you pass an open docking bay.
"You look like you've seen a ghost, kid" he says, his voice and face projecting genuine concern as he spreads all four of his arms.
"What do you say I shout you a drink over at the lodge and you can be evasive and not tell me the problem?"

Sajin startles from his silent thoughts as he hears his nickname. The Nagaian turned quickly at the sound of the familiar voice and broke into a bemused grin. The old Besalisk could call a man all manner of things his mother didn't name him, in half a dozen languages, but he never could pronounce Sajin's name correctly.
Or perhaps he just didn't want to.
"You know that I do not drink, Jack. Still... a glass of water in a less crowded environ would be welcome. I seem to find my mouth suddenly dry."

**Central Spaceport (Sajin)**
Letting out a good-natured chuckle, Old Jack walks over to you and claps you on the back with two of his powerful arms.
"Just you and me, Sage" he says as we leads you towards the Spacers' Lodge, "Maybe when we're done in there, the rest of the crew will have caught up for the day. And maybe you'll finally let me in on some of what's going on in that head of yours"
He chuckles a bit more.
"That would be worth a lot more than a couple of waters"
**(Kelvin)**
"Well we know that Czerka tends to follow the Empire like mynocks to a fusion reactor" Arrisa muses, "So I guess if we want to know what the Empire is up to, we could do worse than finding out where Czerka have set up shop and doing a little snooping there. What do you think, Kelvin?"

### **Anazider** (2008-11-15 08:50:08)

Sajin smirks at the Besalisk, working his shoulder where Jack had "greeted" him earlier.
Jachedostolous Zek, or Old Jack for the tongue-tied, had a soft spot for strays, or so he would often say, and so when Sajin first left the Jedi temple, the Besalisk was the first captain he had crewed out with. Over the years Sajin had come and gone, and Jack had always been accepting each time. Jack was in and out of some scheme every time they crossed paths, but although some of the Besalisk's dealings could be considered crooked, he was an *honest* crooked.
And that's why Sajin liked him.
"Just you and me, Jack," The Nagain spoke quietly, as was his way, as the pair headed for the Spacers' Lodge.
"...And one day I will tell you what has brought me here. I owe you that much at the very least."

**Spacers' Lodge**
After about a minute, you and Jack reach the end of the spaceport's main corridor and arrive at the Spacers' Lodge.
Above the double-doored entrance is a large sign depicting a stylised, anthropomorphic light freighter sleeping in a bed along with the name of the cantina in glowing blue letters. Beside the door, in much smaller script, is a list of services that includes rooms, games, and of course the bar itself.
Still smiling, Jack leads you inside, the entrance doors dutifully sliding open as you approach.
You are immediately greeted by the sight of a small hotel lobby with a deep red carpet decorated with starship designs.
To your left you can see a simple wooden desk staffed by a bored-looking zabrak and a protocol droid, and a turbolift to the other floors.
To your right, which is where Jack is guiding you, is the bar area.
The same floor design continues in here. About a dozen tables shaped like YT-1300 freighters are dotted around the room, with two to five chairs around each. Most are empty at the moment.
In fact apart from a small group of Ugnaughts at the table nearest the entrance, the whole cantina is empty... except for a single human male with black hair who is talking to the droids behind the bar.
"Told you now was a good time" Jack says approvingly as he notes the near total lack of other beings.

"It is at that, Jack. It is at that."
Even with the lounge's seemingly empty appearance, Sajin still made an accursory sweep with his gaze for any sign of lurking danger or surprises.
Sajin negotiated the maze of tables and chairs to get to a more secluded booth towards the back of the bar area. Old Jack, being a bit more rotund than the wirey Nagaian, simply displaced furniture where the thoroughfare is not perfectly clear.
Settling in at acquired table, Sajin hailed for the nearest serving droid while the Besalisk situated himself.

Kayle peeks up from his position behind the fallen table. Some Crazy Kel Dor was doing some Teras Kasi poodoo, physically beting on the lead trooper. The Barabel with the energy sword was holding her own, too. He still couldn't think of how the Empire knew that he was here. He was an Alliance soldier, he would resist the Empire, and he'd start right here, orders or no. He drew a bead on one of the troopers, sighting along his pistol until he had a good shot. When he was confident, he squeezed the firing stud...

**Spacers' Lodge**
As you look around the room, you don't notice anything threatening or particularly interesting for that matter. The human at the bar seems to be wearing a flight suit of an unfamiliar design but other than that there seems to be little of note about him.
Similarly, the Ugnaughts near the entrance are unremarkable; just a small group of dock workers.
Old Jack notices your scrutiny and chuckles.
"If I didn't know better, Sage, I'd say you had a bounty on your head" he says softly, his voice barely above a whisper so that only you can hear him.
"You're looking around like you're expecting someone to jump us"
**Heading North (Kelvin)**
Arrisa nods sagely, then reaches into the folds of a cloak to retrieve a datapad. After consulting it for a few moments, she smiles a little half-smile and pockets it again.
"Ok, accordding to that, Czerka have set up shop north of here" she says calmly, then leads you in that direction.
After a minute or so of walking, the spaceport corridors become noticably cleaner; almost suspiciously pristine in fact, and the doors to the docking bays all bare the mark of Czerka and a warning to keep out.
Up ahead, a large pair of double doors opens to a short open-air walkway leading to a sprawling building with 'Czerka Corporation. Building a Better Galaxy' written on it in large letters, though someone has crossed out 'better' and scrawled 'worse'.
"What do you think, Kelvin?" Arrisa asks, "Shall we keep going to the offices or snoop around their docking bays first?"

Sajin grunts at the Besalisk's comment. He returns his full attention to Old Jack once he is sufficiently satisfied that the common room is as quiet as it appears to be.
"It never hurts to be sure, Jack. I have seen a ghost of a sort this day, but forgive my paranoia."
The Nagaian exhales slowly, easing some of the tension in his shoulders, a tightness he only just now realized was there. Sajin had has very little contact with the Jedi temple since his departure, and that little bit had literally disappeared over night with the temple's destruction.
He had felt the Temple's destruction echo through the Force, more so than he had thought he would. Sajin had all but shut himself off from the Force, so when he suddenly found himself saddled with the deaths of so many, the pain was doubly so because of the violation. But it paled in comparison to that other time...
Sajin shook his head to ward off the foreboding thoughts, hoping he had not left Jack alone in silence for too long.
"I would think this place a little too... *posh*, for you're liking Jack. How'd you find it?"

Kira continues to stay behind cover and fire on the stormtroopers.
Only a standard action to fire this round.

**(Inside the Last Resort)**
It seems the pall of incompetent shooting isn't just affecting the Stormtroopers now. Buck, Kayle, and Kira all miss.
That doesn't mean it's all fun and games for the Imperials. Elu's flying kick knocks the lead trooper flat onto his back. He certainly didn't expect that.
Struggling to recover his dignity, the lead trooper takes one look at the Jedi and the Kel-Dor, then appears to think better of it.
"Abort! Code 5" he calls, reaching behind his back... not to push himself up, but to unhook his stun grenade.
In an attempt to cover his motion, the three troopers who are still standing open fire again, dropping another Weequay, and a Twi'lek couple. The two wounded troopers fire from the ground, dropping the other Twi'lek couple stunned to the floor.

Elu flicked out again with his foot as the stormtrooper let his guard down, reaching behind his back.

**(Inside the Last Resort)**
Elu's lightning attack catches the lead trooper on the side of his head, knocking him back down and causing him to drop his grenade... which is primed, and promptly detonates harmlessly.
Well, mostly harmlessly (5 damage to Elu). It shakes Elu a bit but it knocks out the lead trooper and the other two that were on the ground.
Sissing with laughter, the Barabel looks at the remaining troopers.
"This one told you to leave" she rasps, reaching out with the Force to unhook the grenades from the belts of the two troopers that she wounded a few seconds ago.
"You didn't listen, and now you are responsible for *this*"
On 'this', she uses the Force to launch the grenades at the troopers.
The simultaneous concussion bursts from the grenades blast all three into unconsciousness.
It's over... for now.

### **Tempeste** (2008-11-17 17:37:17)

Elu took a step back and checked himself, he seemed to be alive for now. He then turned to face the barabel with a curious smirk, "You're a Jedi?"

Kayle saw the Barabel with the energy sword gesture with her hands, and the trooper's greande belts all floated in midair. "What the..." He hissed to himself, ducking behind his cover to avoid the flash as they all went off.
The threat gone, Kayle stood up from behind his cover, snapping the blaster pistol back into its holster sharply. He saw the crazy Kel Dor conversing with the Barabel. He felt that he should say something. They did fight to protect him from the patrol, and they maybe were the sign from the Alliance that he was waiting for. He would be cautious, he decided, until he was certain of their allegiances. He pulled the straps securing his jetpack tight, double checked the safety on his pistol, and then walked up to them.

The Nautolan holsters his DH-17, for all the good it did him. He asks to nobody and everybody, "That bucket head in charge said Code 5, I don't know what it means, but we better make ourselves scarce." He looks over at the Barabel who mopped up the place, thinking if the Empire is getting nasty on non-humans, she should be as good a friend as any. He never met or even saw a Jedi, but that must be what she is. He's heard plenty, but never saw how powerful the Force was until now. Though, according to the Empire they are the bad guys, didn't seem that way today.

Kira gets out from behind cover and approaches the Barabel with the lightsaber, holstering her blaster as she gets closer.
"If the Empire is anything it's persistent. They will be back and with a larger force. I suggest everyone leave. Now." she says calmly and meaning to address everyone in the cantina.

"A floating city like this doesn't leave many good hiding places... It would be best if we split up and continued in our normal activities..."

"Who in the galaxy said anything about fighting the Empire!? Did you get stunned in the head by one of those troopers? None fights the Empire and lives, especially alone. We would have a better chance of sticking together but the way that everyone shoots around here I imagine we won't last very long. So I wish you all the best of luck."
Kira turns and looks for the rear exit.

Buck looks at the group, splitting as it may be, "Going back to the ordinary ways is gone. This cantina was one of the last safe places for non-humans. I'm looking for a way outta this place. I can't believe I want off a world more than I did Glee Anselm, but its that time. So I'm all for safety in numbers, at least until I clear my head of that stun blast I took." The Nautolan looks around to see who can offer any ideas.

Kayle couldn't believe what he was hearing. After coming together against the threat, they were on the verge of tucking tail. He stood straighter and addressed the assembled group. "Excuse me," He called, clearing his throat. When he had their attention, he leaned in, continuing in a quieter tone.
"The Empire isn't all-powerful. The Alliance is making a difference, even winning in some parts of the galaxy." He felt his pulse quicken. He was taking a big chance talking to these people. "My name is Sergeant Kayle Arryn, Alliance Special Forces. I'm here on orders, but I haven't heard from my superiors. I'm worried that something happened to them. If you want to fight the Empire, I'm in, and I know how to win."
Kayle breathed out suddenly, unaware that he'd been holding his breath. If they weren't the real ticket, he'd be running for his life for sure. If they were genuine, he'd be running anyway, but at least he'd have company. He glanced around the room, looking for signs of danger. He felt antsy, sure that reinforcements would show up anytime. "If we are going to make a decision, he should make one, before more Stormies show up."
OOC: Where did I put that soap box?

**Approaching the Czerka Complex**
Hrabacca lets out a roar of protest, which is quickly silenced by Arrisa touching his arm.
â€œDon't worry, big guyâ€ she says gently, â€œNone of us are really set up to be stealthy right now, and besides, I think this situation calls for the direct approachâ€
She turns towards you and smiles.
â€œI mean it's hardly going to help their image if they won't even talk to us. Kelvin, do you think you can handle the corporate jargon they'll probably be throwing at us?â€
**Spacers' Lodge**
Jack chuckles at the idea that a spacer hotel is somehow too posh for him.
â€œDon't let the dÃ©cor fool you, Sageâ€ he says, â€œThis place is perfect for anyone who works on a ship or at a spaceport. They just like to make it look nice on account of most ships being pretty darned basic. Everyone needs a vacation every now and then. And the service is fairly unobtrusiveâ€
At that point he turns his attention to the serving droid that has just walked up behind you.
â€œI'll have a Corellian whiskey; Whyren's Reserve if you've got it, and Sage here will have a large water. And while you're at it, I think we'll have some bar snacks. Thanksâ€
The droid nods, then leaves to complete the order, allowing Jack to turn back to you.
â€œSo, my boy. What's this about a ghost?â€
**Inside the Last Refuge**
â€œThis one is indeed a Jediâ€ the Barabel says softly, closing down her lightsabre.
â€œHowever she had hoped to keep that quiet for a while longer. It appearsz that the Empire followed usz. That is very bad. This one muszt see to the injured. If you wish to oppose the Empire, you should all head South to the Crash and Burn cantina. Lose yourselves among the swoop fans. This one will find you laterâ€
As soon as Kayle reveals his identity, the Jedi turns to scrutinise him.
â€œSo you are the one Captain Blake told this one to watch out forâ€ she rasps, then indicates the two Selkath that she had been speaking to just before the raid. â€œThese were this one's contactsz. Keep them safe until this one can reach you again. Hurry, and may the Force be with you allâ€

Elu nodded as the barabel finished speaking. He gave a quick farewell before quickly leaving the Cantina. He'd go to the place the Jedi spoke of, and maybe he could finally make a difference.

"Natural Water, room temperature."
Sajin stared blankly at his hands as they lay folded in his lap, leaving the air between he and Jack in silence until at last he exhaled a sigh, his shoulders slumping.
"I saw someone, and more importantly some *thing*, that reminded brought back memories I had thought long buried."
When the drinks arrived, Sajin bowed to the serving droid, taking up his glass and sipping from it before continuing.
"Tell me Jack, what do you know of the Jedi?"

**The Last Refuge**
Elu barely makes it past the door of the cantina and out onto the street before he is surprised by a pair of Stormtroopers and hit by their stun blasts.
As he loses consciousness and falls to the ground, the last thing he sees is a speeder truck parked in the street; most likely how the Imperials had intended to transport their captives away from here.
"This one's contactsz have informed her that the Hutt always hasz a large crowd at hisz swoop bar" the Barabel Jedi rasps to the others, "There should be no trouble blending in once you are there"
Before she, or anyone else for that matter, can say another word they are interrupted by the sound of two blaster shots from outside...
**Spacers' Lodge**
"Jedi, eh?"
Jack adopts a thoughtful expression and starts scratching at his chin with his upper left hand.
"Been a while since anyone asked me about a Jedi. Met one once. Years ago now, before you and I first met. She was really something. Had a sort of serene beauty like she absolutely knew down to the last detail who she was and where she fitted in to this whole messy galaxy. She was chasing after a slaver if I recall, real nasty piece of work who was holding some Senator's kids for ransom. I won't forget those couple of days. I tell you, Sage. Anyone who buys into the Emperor's lies about the Jedi is either plain stupid or vindictive or they just never met a decent one"
**Czerka Offices**
"Ok, Kelvin" Arrisa says breezily, "Let's go and say hi to the corporate snakes"
Exuding an aura of calm confidence, she leads you and Hrabacca across the open-air walkway and into the Czerka complex.
Inside, everything is meticulously clean. The walls and ceiling are so white they're almost blinding, and the sky-blue floor is being constantly saniscrubbed by a squat droid built for exactly that purpose.
On either side of the entrance are a number of comfortable-looking couches and transparisteel tables. The tables have holo-zine datapads stacked fairly neatly on them. A mixed-species crowd of people are seated on the couches, glancing up at a large chrono every few seconds. Clearly they are waiting for something.
Up ahead is a large reception desk staffed by two droids and a red-skinned female Twi'lek wearing a uniform that is nearly two sizes too small...

Sajin released a sigh, having not realized he had been holding in his breath since he first posed his question to Jack. He leaned forward, folding his hands around his glass as he speaks in a tone that only the Besalisk may hear.
"You are a rare man Jack; most buy into the Empire's propaganda out of fear of reprisal, greed or outright hatred. But... What if I were to tell you that I once studied at the Jedi Academy, just before its destruction?"
The Nagaian stared intently at Jack, his hands still, but internally he roiled at the thought of having his only friend against him.

Jack looks at you curiously, leaning closer as if to study your eyes at extremely close range.
After a moment, he withdraws and resumes his original sitting position.
"As long as that didn't mean you'd been secretly thinking you're better than me for all these years, I'd be fine with it" he says calmly.
"It's like I keep saying, Sage. I think you're a great kid, and that sure would explain a lot about you"

Sajin gazes into the depths of his water glass, watching how the liquid distorts the patterns of the table cloth beneath it.
"I am not better than you Jack, or anyone else for that matter. At least, not by any measure that I can think of."
Draining the rest of his glass, Sajin sets the container aside and reclines in his seat, hooking one boot over the top of the other.
"There is a Jedi here on Manaan, and judging by how deftly she manipulated the Czerka guards, she is of some power. I've this... *feeling*, that something is going to happen, and soon Jack. You may wish to consider pulling up stakes as soon as possible."

"...That is well and fine. Captain of what, precisely? Is he another one of your *merchant* friends?"

The Barabel Jedi walks calmly towards the door, her head tilted slightly as if she is listening for something.
"This one can sensze only two" she rasps, then points with a clawed hand to a spot on the wall to the left of the door.
"One isz there against the wall, perhapsz sixz metres from the door. The second isz moving away, it seemsz he isz carrying our Kel-Dor friend"
With a flash of anger, she slaps her tail against the ground.
"This one should have known there were already more"
**Spacers' Lodge**
Jack chuckles and shakes his head.
"Oh no, my boy" he says jovially, "Blake isn't in any merchant business. He's in the freedom business. He was fighting the Empire even before there was an Alliance. The man's a hero, and as he's here, and you've said a Jedi's here, that's all I need to know that the Rebels are about to make some trouble here for the Empire"
As Jack is speaking, Blake walks over to your table and pulls up a chair.
"I guess that means my plan worked" he says, flashing a world-weary grin, "Is this seat taken?"

Feeling sufficiently trapped, Sajin nods slightly but says nothing, drawn in upon himself. If it wasn't for Jack being who he was, the Nagaian likely would have stood and left, not of a mind to get himself caught in the current struggles of the universe.

Kayle now had his mission. He felt a renewed sense of duty and importance as he looks over the two Selkath contacts. He had to protect them from Imperial capture. On the other hand, their friend was in trouble.
He was torn about what to do, but these two were Alliance Operatives, and he was an Alliance Sergeant. He knew that he had to see them safely away, that he would give his life for them if needs be. He scanned the room for a rear egress. He would move them out away from the Imperial Stormtroopers outside, and make his way toward the Crash and Burn. They would get lost in the crowd just as the Jedi had said, and await pick up.

Buck acknowledges the order from the Jedi, sneaking out the back with the crowd is fine with him. He holsters his pistol and goes to gather the rifles, "Sarge, I've got the guns, start getting them towards that cellar, I'll bring up the rear." As he picks up the first one, he asks the soldier, "You want one now?" (IF: yes, he tosses him one)
Buck then grabs one and folds the stock, setting it beside him. He wraps up the other rifles in a utility belt off a downed trooper to carry under his left arm. He carries this rifle in his right hand.

Outside, Kira's blaster bolt misses the Stormtrooper and slams into the side of the speeder truck.
Without hesitating, the trooper drops Elu, swings his rifle into line and flicks it over to lethal in one fluid movement then pulls the trigger.
A burning red blaster bolt leaps across the gap between the trooper and Kira and slams agonisingly into her right thigh (21 damage, one step down the condition track) only to be followed up a moment later by a stun bolt from the second trooper, which blasts her into unconsciousness...

Kayle heard the Barabel's orders, all business. "Yes ma'am." He barked. He turned to address the Selkath. "You two follow close behind me." He shouted over the noise to the crowd. "Do as I tell you, stay calm, and nobody will die today." It was the same short speech that he gave on every other protection detail.
He turned to regard Buck. "Here." He said, holding his hands to receive a catch. He snatched the tossed carbine out of the air, and turned it over to check the power pack. It was a few shots light. "You have the rear guard. These people are counting on you today, stay vigilant." He waved the group forward with his hands. Moving behind the bar, he stepped up to the open grate leading to the cellar. He was excited, filled with adrenaline. He remembered the time he'd spent with his old unit, the 112th Alliance Aerial Infantry. He silently repeated the motto like a prayer against danger. *'AI Angels Soar, And Hell Comes With Them'.*
Hefting the familiar weight of the carbine, he made his way down the ladder into the cellar...

Blake inclines his head slightly in your direction, a microscopic nod of respect.
"I can appreciate that" he says calmly, "In fact I'd say it's almost refreshing to meet a man who prefers straight talk. I'll tell it exactly as it is. As you may or may not know, the Empire has a tight lock on Thyferra; tighter than here. So tight in fact that we haven't had any luck getting in there. With Thyferra and Manaan, the Emperor controls the health of the galaxy. Any world or group that does not demonstrate suitable loyalty to the Imperial regime has their access to medical supplies cut off. Currently, their only alternative is to go to the Hutts, who are somehow getting some of the bacta away from the Imperials, and pay cripplingly extortionate prices or face death and disease on a terrible scale. We intend to alieviate the suffering of these innocents"
He pauses, and indicates your surroundings.
"Here on Manaan, the situation is different to on Thyferra. The Selkath have been able to negotiate a deal that keeps the Empire from just coming in all guns blazing and taking all the kolto by force. Of course the Empire is not happy about this. We have some, unfortunately sketchy, intel that points to an operation that is in the final stages of preparation. When it is ready, the Empire will break their deal with the Selkath and attempt to take the kolto directly from its source. What they cannot take by force they intend to take by betrayal. Our goals here are threefold. First we must gather incontravertable proof of the impending acts of treachary and deliver it to the Selkath High Court. Second, we must stop the Imperial operation, with or without the backing of the High Court. I imagine the only way we will not have their backing is if we have to move against the Empire before we can get the judges the proof. And third, we must support the Selkath in their bid to throw off the shackles of Imperial occupation.
Does this sound like something you want to help with?"

Still trying to distract you with her figure, the Twi'lek woman whispers "Anything you can think of" then turns to the droid on her right.
"I think this young man is exactly what we are looking for. Arrange an Aleph-3 appointment with Executive Jax at once"
"Aleph-3 confirmed, Mistress" the droid replies, "Executive Jax will be available in five standard minutes"
Smiling broadly, the Twi'lek woman turns back to you.
"Would you like to take a seat, or would you rather stay and talk to little me?" she asks suggestively.
**Under the Last Refuge**
The last think Buck hears before the hatch leading to the cellar is closed is the snap-hiss of an igniting lightsabre.
The cellar itself is a large chamber filled with barrels of various ales, and shelves stacked with bottles of spirits.
Near the southern end of the room, the two Gran bartenders activate a hidden control somewhere, and a floor tile retracts, revealing a sloping tunnel.
"This slide leads to the emergency maitenance tunnels at the very base of the city" one of the Gran explains to Kayle.
"It is extremely illegal for us to have such an access. but times being what they are, we suspected that it would become necessary. There is a risk that some of the tunnels may be flooded. It would be safest for you to emerge either in the South-West Residential Sector, and then make your way to the Crash and Burn on the surface levels as that will attract less suspicion than everyone here appearing in there from a hidden location. However, you are a military man so I leave it to you to decide. Good luck, and may the Force be with you"

Sajin sits in silence, his eyes downcast, as he absorbs all that the captain has to say. He maintains his silence even after Blake finishes, allowing the quiet to permeate the room with the exception of the scurrying of the pair of serving droids.
"I... cannot help, Wes Blake. The Will of the Force is clearly evident here, but honor commands me otherwise. I am still not yet strong enough..."
The Nagaian speaks in a near whisper, cryptically trailing off at the very end. He looks up, meeting both the smuggler and the rebel stare-for-stare, yet seeming to look beyond them. Sajin's countenance remains blank, except for a weary resignation tugging at the corner of his eyes.

"Good luck, and May The Force Be With You." The bartenders said to Kayle.
"And with you." He replied. He slapped the Gran on the shoulder, sat down on the chute, and slid. The sensation was not unlike descending with a jetpack. He felt the fetid air whip across his face, the rush of adrenaline as his body accelerated, and he cracked a smile.
The ground came up faster than he'd expected in the dim near-darkness of the maintenance tunnel. Kayle half-jumped up from the impact, landing crouched in knee deep water. The carbine snapped into firing position, its stock set firmly in Kayle's shoulder. He swept the tunnel, discovering no immediate threats to target. It was moments later that the patrons of the Last Refuge came sliding along into the deep tunnel. Kayle immediately called for silence and they passed the word up the line. He didn't want to stay long, but he would do it by the book. He would check in with the rear guard before he advanced, maintain unit cohesion. He would run this withdraw like a soldier, he just hoped that he wouldn't die like one in the process...

Buckaradon lets the last patron have a enough of a head start to clear the ramp before he lands, says to the Gran cantina operators, "Thank you and good luck." With that said, he slides down the chute. His eyes are well adapted for underwater environs and the semi-darkness of the chute is clear as day. He lands in water, something he's very comfortable in. He checks up the ramp with his carbine raising his right arm in a one handed shooters stance.
The patrons down here tell him to be silent, and he sends word back up the line, "Good to go, pass it up, quietly." He remains alert, looking out for pursuers or really any threat coming at them. His thoughts go back to hunting expeditions of his childhood, just because you are hunting one thing, or this case running, doesn't mean others won't get you.

Blake sighs, then looks thoughtful for a few moments.
"Honour" he murmurs, looking between you and Jack.
"You feel that you have lost your honour?"
It is a statement as much as a question.
"Would helping me to help the innocent not restore your honour?" he asks gently, obviously not willing to give up on you yet.

Sajin's golden eyes narrow as the Wes appeals to his honorable sensibilities.
"Captain, you apparently have not had many dealings with the Nagai, otherwise you would not be so... *brazen* in speaking to me of what burdens I bear, so I will forgive you this once."
The former jedi languidly slides to his feet, slinging his journey pack and his utility belt over a shoulder once he is standing at his full height.
"Are we quite finished here Wes Blake? I suspect you have a great deal more recruiting to do, and I would not want to keep you here under false pretenses."
A cold detachment replaces the flash of fury the Nagaian had displayed just moments before. Sajin barely awaits either the Captain's or Jack's response before making for the exit, not sparing a backward glance for the pair.

Kayle got the 'all clear' signal from buck. He took a step forward, then stopped. He turned to the two operatives that he was protecting. "Here," he said, slipping the blaster pistol deftly from the holster on his hip. He handed it to one of them. "Take it. If I shoot something, you shoot it. If we get separated, you run for the Crash and Burn, and take these people with you. Don't worry. That's my service pistol...I'll want that back."
With that, he raised his hand for silence, and began the long exodus through the maintenance tunnel...
OOC: Sorry it took sooo long.

Sweeping out of the Spacer's Lodge, Sajin turned a corner, idle angry thoughts carrying his feet without direction.
*If I were any other Warrior, Wes Blake would be drowning in his words!*
The ex-padawan stopped, both of his hands holding tightly to the pack over his shoulder as he silently brooded.
*…But I am a warrior no longer, and such is not the Jedi way. Yet I am not a Jedi either. What does that make me?*
Sajin thought deeply on the question before arriving to no appreciable conclusion. He looked up then, having lost himself in some alleyway or another deeper into the space port.
Shrugging his shoulders with a sigh, the Nagain raised the cowl of his cloak and allowed his thoughts to continue to carry him deeper into Ahto City's shadow.

â€œThis seems dangerousâ€ a Quarren from the bar observes, indicating the water in the tunnel.
â€œWhile my kind, and the Selkath themselves are perfectly at home in the water, it would seem that allowing these tunnels to become flooded is most unsafe. Especially if they are filled with sophisticated equipment. Such apparent negligence would only make sense if they wanted to keep the Empire out of here. Given the Imperials' obvious disdain for non-humans, they would need little persuasion to leave seemingly dangerous work to the locals or to slaves. What do you think, sergeant?â€

MAINTENANCE TUNNELS
Kayle sloshed through the flooded tunnel, slowed by the weight of the water. He mulled over the Quarren's observation for a few moments. "That's a very good point. Send a message back to call up my rear guard." (OOC: When Buck arrives, a little roleplay?) 'If the Alliance has agents in these tunnels...' thought Kayle. He addressed the Quarren. "What are you called? And how did you reach such a conclusion? Are you sympathetic to the Alliance cause?"
Kayle continued leading the ragged column through the tunnel. He was beginning to feel a little better, apperantly surrounded by more Alliance sympathizers than he'd thought. It was comforting to him, after the months alone of Selkath. On the other hand, the Empire's spies were everywhere. He decided to err on the side of caution in the future.
OOC: freeclint, how about joining me up here for the whole walk? Even though it makes good sense, there really isn't much opportunity for roleplay...

Buck gets word to report to the front, something must be wrong. As he quietly makes his way up, he checks, whispering, if anyone in line can use blasters. If so, he arms them as rear guard with the confiscated blaster carbines.
(IF: there are enough that can fight, THEN: he'll give up his own carbine and return to his pistol as held weapon)
He gets to the front of the line, and realizes that this Seargent Kayle must be out of his element, slogging through water carrying that jetpack. He nods at the one he is calling Sarge, "Buckaradon Carcharious, call me Buck. 'Sup Sarge?"

Kayle breathed a sigh of relief when Buck sloshed up the line beside him. He had always followed orders, trusted the people around him, he'd always been a galactic boy scout. Filled with doubt and suspicion, it felt good to be shoulder to shoulder with a comrade that he trusted. He whispered loudly, hissing the words. "Buck, we may not have to worry about an Imperial prescence in these tunnels. We may have to worry about an Alliance prescence." He saw the confused look on the scout's face. He clarified. "If the Alliance secretly controls the maintenance tunnels, they may well shoot first and ask later. I can see fine to navigate down here, but that's all. I need your eyes to find sentries. If we see them before they see us, we might all live, and I won't have to kill a friendly."

As you leave the Lodge and return to the Spaceport, you notice that things seem oddly quiet. Almost too quiet. Where there should be the sounds of beings at work, there is... nothing. The silence is palpable and likely more than a little unsettling as though something is going on...

â€œI'm so glad you didn't stay and flirt with herâ€ Arrisa deadpans, inclining her head slightly towards the Twi'lek woman behind the desk.
â€œShe was this close to falling out of her top and making a huge scene and then I'd be torn between watching you talk your way out of the situation, or trying to be sneaky while everyone was distractedâ€
She pauses long enough to offer you a grin.
â€œJust kidding. I've been told I have a weird sense of humour. I would never really use you like that, and to be honest, I think she was trying to play you. To get a job with Czerka, she'd have to have embraced being manipulativeâ€

â€œMy name is Kresuskâ€ the Quarren replies, his mouth-tentacles splaying in an odd pattern that another of his kind would recognise as complete sincerity.
â€œUntil today I had not experienced the Empire's prejudices and heavy-handed tactics for myself, merely heard of their employment against others. I have many friends who have suffered, and I am able to deduce much from what I hear. While I lack the physical skill to fight the Empire, I am able to use my brain to work out ways for others with that skill to do so. These tunnels, as I said before, are unlikely places for the Empire to be unless they have to. Local dissidents could have come to a similar conclusion. In fact given that we are wading through water and the Selkath are amphibious, I would be more surprised were I to learn that they hadn't thought of using these tunnels. There is also another possible user of these tunnels, or rather users. Agents of the being that we hope to help hide us from further Imperial harassmentâ€
**(Kira and Elu)**
Slowly but surely, the numb darkness begins to fall away, replaced with sensation once again.
You can feel that you are resting on something softer than bare duracrete, which can't be a bad thing. The agony you felt before blacking out is gone, which is also good. Though your eyes aren't yet focused enough to show anything but a bright blur, the smell of your surroundings should prove reassuring. You can smell kolto and antiseptics, and other aromas common to hospitals, strongly suggesting that you are in a medical facility of some kind, and the lack of restraints suggests that it is not run by the Empire...

Sajin's stride slowed as he warily looked around the spaceport. Even the tense hustle and bustle of the Imperial occupation was missing, and the stillness spoke volumes.
The Nagaian clutched his cloak tighter about himself, using the gesture to lay a hand on the hidden lightsaber at his back. He walked a few steps and then paused, unsure of himself before hesitantly reaching out with senses he hadn't used in years.

"We can't go off searching for an Alliance cell that may not exist. We have a job to do. We need to get these people safely away, but more importantly, the two informants must reach the safety of the Alliance alive. We are going to procede along this route until we get to access hatch AH-23. We take that to the surface. Then its a jog to the Crash and Burn. We hook up with my superiors, and dust off this rock."

The two Selkath informations suddenly seem to be somewhat agitated, speaking rapidly to each other in their own language. Unfortunately, neither of you speak Selkath, so you can't be entirely sure what has agitated them...
**Central Spaceport**
As you stop for a few moments and reach out with your old Force senses, you start to become aware of a sense of rising pressure somewhere to the south-east. A fairly large concentration of life and heightened emotion suggests that something big is soon to happen. In the back of your mind, just for a split second, you think you hear a female voice from your past.
*â€œSajin, you have to be thereâ€*

Where before the Nagaian had skulked, Sajin stood fully erect as he stared towards the southeast with hard, emotionless eyes. He had wandered, using vague cues from the Force as an impetus, but actually feeling little to nothing since he had walled himself away from the mystical source.
And now that he had received a clarion, one in an all too familiar voice, he hesitated.
"The Force wills... and I *must* heed its call. *Her* call..."
Sajin hitched the equipment pack over his shoulder and made his way towards the disturbance in the south, his stride resolute and quick.

As you start to wake up, a Selkath in medical whites approaches you and begins speaking in his own language, gesturing for you to lay back down. In his other flipper, he holds what looks like some kind of datapad or scanner.
**East Central (Sajin)**
Your quickened pace quickly brings you from the spaceport to a large open area of the city. Ovoid pools of shallow water help to break up the area, and at other times would likely serve to add to a sense of tranquility.
For now, however, it seems that tranquility is about as likely as snow on Mustafar.
Ahead and to the left, against a backdrop of what looks like a coral reef fashioned from the metal of the city, a large crowd has gathered. Most of them appear to be Selkath, though a few other species are also present. Most appear to be juveniles, and almost every member of the crowd seems to be holding up a large placcard.
You can't read any of them from where you are, but two voices ring out leaving you in no doubt as to the point of this gathering. First the watery tones of a Selkath, then the slightly mechanical tones of a translator unit.
"We cannot let this abuse continue! The Empire thinks it can walk all over us! They close our temple and we just take it! If the elders won't fight back then it falls to us! We are the future of Manaan and we will not stand by while our planet is raped by invaders! Are you with me?"
The crowd do indeed seem to be with the speaker, and take up a chant in multiple languages.
"Fight the Empire! Save our People!"

### **Anazider** (2008-12-17 20:44:28)

Sajin moves closer to the crowd, his head bowed and the cowl of his cloak casting his visage in shadows. He listens intently to the rhetoric, allowing the words, and more so their emotion, wash over him.
It was a protest riot, a dangerous thing to be amid the Imperial occupation, but the Nagaian stood his ground. He didn't need his facility with the Force to feel the palpable aura of fear, desperation, and most importantly hope, that permeated the crowd. Sajin stood conflicted, the mix of emotions stirring within him feelings he had thought tightly reined long ago.
"The Empire is not well know for its treatment of dissidents. Is this temple- your honor- so very important that you would risk your lives so?"
Sajin spoke quietly, but clearly, to no one in particular, speaking more so to give voice to his own thoughts, rather than seeking a direct answer.

After a few moments, Buck stops. Aside from his splitting headache, and leading a buncha fugitives through the sewers, he doesn't need this jibbering behind him, giving away their position. He turns and looks at the two Selkath, "We're trying to be quiet here, what is the matter?"
