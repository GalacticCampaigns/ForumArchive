Hello Players,
SO we will use this area for our RP section. This blue book section idea is new to me so we will start this as a trial. Post away and enjoy the game. This also means that in addition to the game posts and the chatter box as a player you must watch this thread as well.

Tar'ja was rather in rapt attention to his description of his parents, he was loving of them in his tone even if they wanted to keep him from what would have helped him. How strange...was that what family was supposed to do? And this Master of his...she wondered if she would have liked him if she had met him. How strange.
He wanted to see them again someday, after he had become some knight....whatever that meant. She wondered if she'd get to go with him, if he'd allow her to meet his parents, would they be hostile to a non-human? She was very curious on this.
She nods her head slowly in understand "they sound...interesting." she didn't know how else to put that really. "Have you questions for me?" she asked, curious what he might wish to know.

### **Yogi** (2010-11-11 23:07:57)

Tar'ja was watching him intently as he spoke about his parents and Garet. He could see that she had questions but held them in check so as to not disturb his story. After reliving some painful and joyous memories he met her gaze again and nodded that he was finished for the moment. He head was nodding as she mentioned that his parents sounded interesting. He wasn't sure if she really thought that or didn't really know what to say.
"Have you questions for me?" The curiosity in her voice was evident. She wondered what he wanted to know of her. Truth was he wanted to know everything. Yet they only had a short time. He thought for a moment as he shifted on the chair moving her slightly in his lap repositioning her to a more comfortable spot. He smiled as he looked at her. Never would he have thought would he have fallen for a womanlike this. One that had such a tough exterior and steely resolve yet had a side to her that was soft and caring.
**"Yes I do."** He said as his smile remained the memory of his parents rapidly fading into the past again. His face became serious again. It was a foretelling of the question that he was pondering as he knew questions of her family were a sore subject. But he didn't want to know about that family. **"Since we're speaking of families what do you remember of yours? Not the ones that kept you in chains only to do their bidding whenever they wanted but your real family.? Do you…even remember them? Do you want to see them again? even if only to show them that that you survived and are stronger now that you would have been."** The questions seemed to keep coming. When he stopped to take a breath his hand gave hers a gentile squeeze.

Tar'ja stared at him, or rather through him; searching her memories. Did she even know them? A frown crosses her lips as she shakes her head, the earliest memory she had was of a birthday, that consisted of her first kill and a crumble of a cake they had had for themselves.
She thought harder and sighed "I..." she shakes her head "I remember a body and hiding in darkness before I was picked up by 'mother'...but that's it." She looks to him in annoyance "I'm...sorry I don't remember anything to tell you...." he told her such lovely stories of his past...and she had nothing but darkness to give him. she didn't know her real family, she didn't know if they were alive or dead or who that body was. She didn't even know why she had been hiding.

### **Yogi** (2010-11-12 07:33:01)

After several moments she finally shook her head causing her lekku to follow suit. What came next caused a pit to form in the depths of his stomach as the memory he caused her to relive was one of death. "I'm...sorry I don't remember anything to tell you...."
Quickly he was shaking his head to match hers. **"No no, it's alright. I should have known not to ask you about that. So much for that great Jedi insight that I'm supposed to have."** He paused for a moment and sighed as a look of embarrassment crossed his features. A thought came to mind and he cleared his throat. **"A new time in your life has started right?"** His head nodded slightly. **" So lets start making new memories now with this…"** He jerked his head towards the back of the ship. **"motley assembled team…"** He paused for a long second as his blue eyes captured her own. **"And…with me."** He gave her that half smile he seemed to only use for her now. **"I know I'd like that very much."** He said softly as he rubbed her back gently. The back of his arm brushing up against one lekku that had fallen back when she shook her head moments ago. If the past couldn't be remembered or didn't want to be remembered there was no reason she couldn't start anew.

His smile returned to her lips, the dark thoughts and the...emotions from not knowing her own past or real family forgotten with just a look from him, with his words of reassurance.
He was right, if she couldn't think of her own past she could make her future worth remembering, with him especially. "You certainly have been bringing a lot to my life lately..." she says, resting her head against his, eyes closing with a sigh at the brush to her lekku.
"What to ask.." she says with a sigh and thinks of one "had you ever had a pet?" she asks curious.

## Re: Blue Space

### **Yogi** (2010-11-12 21:26:11)

He was glad to see a smile return to her face as she seemed to be thinking about what he had said about making new memories fora new past that she can look back upon. "You certainly have been bringing a lot to my life lately..." She said softly as he rested her head against his.
At her question about having a pet he nodded slightly so as to not disturb her head. **"Yeah I had two Tookes that my father had purchased for me. He was told that they were two males. About three to four weeks later one of the little guys had a little of seven."** His chuckle brought a smile to his face. **"Simply put we were surprised. After selling or giving away the others we finally had a pair of males so that wouldn't happen again. They were cute and pretty friendly."** Making a fist he held it out for her to see. **"They were a little smaller than this and they had rather large feet that they would hop around on. Add a tail and you have a Tooke. They were quick and could get into or under just about anything."** He paused for a moment. **"I had them for quite a few years. When they were gone we never got another pet. I was getting older and I guess I just didn't have the interest of wanting another pet to take care of. Around that time I was taking a greater interest in girls."**
He shrugged his shoulders as his hand continued to rub her back comfortingly. **"Has there ever been any place that you've wanted to go or do. Maybe experience something you never had the chance to do before."** He was trying a little bit to be careful. He didn't want to bring up past memories like the last question did. Maybe he could figure out something to surprise her with.

### **zerah** (2010-11-13 13:04:36)

She smiled at the image she conjures of a Tooke, chuckling as the two males had given birth, finding that rather humorous, though she supposed she understood not wanting another pet, the opposite gender would have been much more interesting to a young male...at least she figured that was about right.
Had she ever wanted to go somewhere? It was silly..."I read about a spay" she said sheepishly "that...resort thing..where you sit in mud and people bring you drinks. and they use rocks on your back for decoration." She laughs faintly "it was a very strange thing, I don't understand the appeal but I have wanted to try it....among other things." she looks away from him for a long moment, clearing her throat with a small smile.
"I wanted to see Ewoks too. and Wookies. Giant and small furry things seem quite pleasant to meet and study." She tilts her head "have you wanted to go or do anything?"

## Re: Blue Space

### **Yogi** (2010-11-14 01:17:18)

Chase smiled as she was explaining about the spa. The thought of her sitting in a mud bath with a drink in one hand and her blaster in another brought a big smile to his face. "...among other things." The last bit he had heard but it didn't register till he realized she had stopped talking, causing him to stop thinking about her in a mud bath, and refocus on her as his smile faded some. It was then he realized she had looked away as she cleared her throat with a small smile.
An eyebrow raises at the comment as it sinks in. **"Oh."**
He didn't get a chance to question her about the comment as she started talking about Wookies and Ewoks. She tilted her head exposing the long lines of her lilac colored neck and the 'among other things' came back into his mind. "Have you wanted to go or do anything?"
***Oh yes.*** He thought as a slight tint of read came to his cheeks as he brought a hand to his mouth and cleared his own throat. **"Um yeah."** His mind raced as he thought of several different things he had always wanted to do. **"Courscant. I've always wanted to go there since Garet started telling me of the Jedi temple there. The Empire leveled it when they took power so I don't foresee that coming to pass. Still a planet that is one giant city must hold something interesting to do and see."** He smiled as he looked into her eyes. **"Also you're idea of mud baths sounds like a great idea. I've heard that cleaning up afterwords can be just as much fun as the bath itself."** He gave her a sly smile as his arms pulled her in close before continuing. **"I wonder if I could find someone who would want to do that with me."** He teased kissing her gently on the neck. **"Though I doubt we'll stumble upon a place like that where we're going. Much less the chance to partake in such an adventure."**

### **zerah** (2010-11-14 03:15:02)

Tar'ja smirks in return to him, kissing him again before pulling away "I wouldn't mind joining you if you offer." she says, chuckling faintly "and who knows..maybe we'll be rewarded..or a nice place to go when we retire for all of this and go on vacation..that is...if you wanted to go together...if you didn't mind the company."
She smiles, his smile and rests her head against him again with a sigh "what were your favorites topics in school?" she had seen few class settings, it was her assumption as most children were not around during the day that they had them then, while hers were whenever her 'family' wanted.

---

## Re: Blue Space

### **Yogi** (2010-11-14 12:58:02)

"...If you wanted to go together...if you didn't mind the company." He opened his eyes a few seconds after she broke off her kiss reflection on her words. His face took on a serious expression as he realized that his teasing may not have been totally understood.
His voice had softened as a slightly more serious tone took over. **"Tar'ja, there is no one else I'd want to do that with. I would love to have you by my side in anything that we do. Weather it be tomorrow or many years from now."**
Smiling she had rested her head against him again as she continued on with another question, this time about school.
Chase ran a hand through his hair. School. That seemed like it was so long ago. **"I was a good student over all. I liked geography and history the most though."** Pausing for a moment as he reflected back he asked her the same. **"What about you? I'm guessing that going to school wasn't quite the same as what I did?"** He quickly made a grimace as he realized that his question again brought her back to a time that she'd probably rather forget. **"I'm sorry I seem to keep asking you about times that you would probably rather forget. Forgive me."** Once again he slowly rubbed his hand against her back as he silently chastised himself. So far, it seemed to him, all he had done was put his foot into his mouth.

## Re: Blue Space

### **zerah** (2010-11-14 13:20:42)

She chuckles faintly at his...well...what he thinks as mistakes and shakes her head "I know you'd ask questions of my past...and that's alright, it's better to understand what life was like to better understand the person I am." She had come to terms with the past, after all, she was the one that left and killed them to get away. It was her past, she hated them but it was hers.
"I was taught...I..suppose the unconventional, the things to better what skills I have now and to test my limits of others." She tilts her head "but when I would spy on classes, the real ones..I liked the ones that were about languages...and.." she glances to the door then back to him, was that embarrassment to her next confession? "Art.." she looked away, laughed and hid her face, it was one of the things she hid from them, that she liked looking at art, learning of artists. She knew if her 'father and mother' knew, they likely would have started to train her to either steal some or learn to fake them.
Her interest in art was pure, and she had been determined to keep it that way.

---

## Re: Blue Space

### **Yogi** (2010-11-14 14:20:23)

With a breath of relief that also took form on his face he was glad that she wasn't upset with his questions. He wanted to know all he could about about her and unfortunately some of those questions dealt with her past.
She had started talking about classes she had spied on. She had an interest in languages. He knew a few himself and was about to ask her what others he knew but stopped short when she glanced to the closed cockpitl door. Looking back to him when she was sure that no one was listening in she laid her confession bare. "Art." Looking away she hid her face with a laugh.
Smiling at the innocence of her confession he let out a light chuckle. **"Tar'ja that's nothing to be ashamed of. Art can be fun. I was never really good at it and didn't like it much. But when I was older I had a teacher make it fun for the class. I'm still not to good at it but I appreciate it a lot more than I used to.**
She had turned her head back towards him when he was speaking. The look of embarrassment was still there but only slightly. **"You know that Corellia has some of the best museums in the galaxy?"** He nodded his head as she looked at him. **"Really. We could go there and see them."** He paused for a moment searching her eyes. **"And since we'd be on Corellia we could even see my family. That is if you would want to do that?"**

Listening to him talk, she found was a calming thing for her, and her embarrassment subsided all the more at the mention of the best museums; to go and see those pictures she read about? the ones in the books? in person? That felt like a distant dream, especially now that she was hunted, but..maybe someday..
"You'd...let me meet your parents?" she was hopeful, but then she was confused. Maybe she didn't understand customs so well...but the old stories and couples she spied on.. "isn't that a deceleration of marriage?" she asks honestly. She had no knowledge of relationships, save that her 'mother and father' were together and kissed often, and that relationships culminated in a baby at some point. But she....was very certain of a the meeting of parents was somewhere having to do with marriage..or something.

---

## Re: Blue Space

### **Yogi** (2010-11-14 15:34:51)

Watching as her face lit up at the mention of museums he smiled. So much had been withheld from her as a child it seemed that many of the things that he took for granted were new experienced for her.
"You'd...let me meet your parents?" She asked right after he mentioned meeting them. Not think anything of it he nodded. **"Yeah why wouldn't I?"** He saw the confused look fall across her face.
"Isn't that a deceleration of marriage?" His eyebrows shot up as the words sunk in.
**"Umm."** She had caught him off guard. Not only that a shade of crimson took control of his cheeks as he struggled to quickly find an answer. **"N…no. I mean in some cultures, I think, that might be a deceleration of marriage but not all.** He took a breath trying to calm the heat that was all too obvious in his face. **"I mean, at some point, one would meet the others patents before getting married but meeting them does not mean a deceleration of marriage."** He cleared his throat a bit looking up at her regaining some composure. **"If that was the case I would have been married two or three times by now. It's more of a getting to know you type of thing"** He said with a small smile wondering if her was making any sense to her.

## Re: Blue Space

### **zerah** (2010-11-14 16:15:31)

Tar'ja watches him curiously, she had embarrassed him? she nods in understanding as he explains "so it is not the custom..." she nods again "what is the custom?" she asked before it registered what he had said. When it had her gaze narrows, an odd feeling moving over her entire body as she clutches her fists into his shirt "who are these two or three peoples that have met with this tradition?"
there was little to say otherwise, that she likely wasn't thinking of killing them off to better ensure they would not return to what was slowly becoming a 'mine' in her own mind.

---

## Re: Blue Space

### **Yogi** (2010-11-14 17:56:33)

"What is the custom?"
Glad that he was on the track to explaining it he smiled opening his mouth. **"Well you se…"** As he started speaking he missed that her eyes had narrowed and her posture in his lap took on a different meaning. Two lilac colored fists were balled into his shirt holding his fast.
"Who are these two or three peoples that have met with this tradition?"
His neck craned back as he looked at her questioningly trying to figure out what had caused this reaction from her. **"Tar'ja I…"** It was then he realized that his mentioning of the other girls that had met his parents and her understanding that it was a deceleration of marriage that brought on the reaction. **"Tar'ja its not what you think."** He said calmly to her as his hands moved to meet hers. Gently removing them from his shirt only to hold them. He could see the look in her eyes as she maybe thought there was something in his past that might conflict with things or more specifically, her.
**"Listen just because, years ago, I've brought a few girls to meet my parents does *not* mean a marriage deceleration."** His voice had taken on a more serious tone. He could see by the look in her eyes that he wasn't making things any better. His voice softened a bit. **"Tar'ja for me a marriage deceleration of marriage would require that I ask that person to marry me or the other way around. My parents would have noting to do with it.** He let a small sigh escape. **"The girls I dated when I was younger was just that, dating. Nothing serious came from it. I moved on or they did. What feelings I *had* for them pale in comparison to the feelings I have for you. I've told you how I felt, that hasn't changed one bit."** He held her hands in his between them waiting to see her reaction to his words. Hoping that she would understand.

## Re: Blue Space

### **zerah** (2010-11-15 02:02:46)

Tar'ja was very confused, but was calming down at the mention they paled compared to her. good. then he wouldn't miss them much if they attempted to worm into her territory.
Asking was his tradition, it was good knowledge for her but she was still curious "what is dating?" she asks, and relaxing she plays with his shirt "and...what..exactly.is marriage about?" she frowns "what does it mean to be a wife? or a husband? or a mother or father?" she looks up to him "what is a family really like?"

---

## Re: Blue Space

### **Yogi** (2010-11-15 10:51:04)

He felt her relax some but confusion was still evident on her face. She removed her hands from his and started playing with the front of his shirt. It brought a smile to his face as he felt her hands working the shirt and touching his chest. After a quick moment she began asking more questions.
**"When you ask questions you sure don't ask the easy ones because with those if you ask three different people you'll get three different answers. I'll do my best to answer them alright? "** He gave her a slight nod as he began to form his thoughts.
He took a breath as he began. **"Dating. Well what we're doing now is best defined as dating."** He smiled and looked down as he felt her hands moving along his chest. **"It's considered a time between meeting and marriage. Where the two involved get to know each other better. See if they really like one another and can get along."** He chuckled as he remembered one of the girls he dated. **"Believe me not everyone gets along well."**
He ran his fingers lightly up her arm to her elbow and back down again.**"Marriage, remember for other cultures it's probably different. For me and my experience seeing it with family and friends its the joining of two people who love each other. It's a pledge to spend their lives together. My parents have been married for over twenty-five years. Do they always see eye to eye?"** He paused for a moment, averting his gaze, he remembered the day he left home. **"No they don't but they do lover each other and can accept the differences that all people share."** Bringing his head back up he looked at her. **"That's a big part of being a family I guess. Accepting the differences between people and still supporting them in what they decide to do."** He paused again but this time continued looking into her beautiful eyes. **"It doesn't always happen though. Beliefs and ideas sometimes get in the way making it hard for that to happen. No family is perfect. It always a work in progress."**
He took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair again. **"It's a complicated subject Tar'ja, hard to explain. I'm not sure I even did an adequate job talking about it. Like many things experiencing it is the best way to learn about it."** He reached for one of her hands. **"I can only imaging what your experience was with family. It must have been much different than mine."**

## Re: Blue Space

### **zerah** (2010-11-16 13:58:12)

She listens intently, absorbing this new information to understand better of his customs, to know him better.
So they were...dating. which was the step before marriage if dating went well...how long did it need to go well? was there a specific date or set amount of time that dating was needed before more steps were taken? what if one wasn't sure if things were right?
Marriage was less confusing, it was one time yes? People could get along but...not get along and still be married...that seemed rather strange, counter-intuitive if one was trying make a good match but allowed for things like that to step in...then again maybe that was the point? to enjoy being with someone even if you argue?
Family was accepting differences, and being together.
She frowned at that, thinking of her own 'family' as he mused on the same topic. "They didn't bother to understand..." she says "they...liked each other...they enjoyed their time in teaching, in making jokes of me, in hitting, in drinking..." she tilts her head "they didn't all look alike.." she looks to him "is that required of family? to look alike? young ones...that I watched, that had the same mother, looked like her or the father, and each other...those are real siblings yes? so...they have to look alike." She frowns "so...my..siblings weren't real ones." she nods her head "comforting."
It actually had the tone of being comforting, her 'family' hadn't been real, any part of it, that meant at least she wouldn't turn out like them right? right..
She's quite for a bit in thought before she asks another..awkward question "have you ever wanted children?"

### **Yogi** (2010-11-16 16:57:13)

**In the cockpit of the <em>Last Hope</em>**
He watched her nod along as he tried his best to explain things. He was sure that he left out a few things probably the more important things to mention but pushed it off to the side as he focused on her. He could almost see the gears turning in her head as he sorted and rationalized all this new information he was trying to explain.
She sat there quietly with him, on his lap, as she thought of his own question about her 'family'. He listened as she began to talk about it. There was no hiding the surprise on his face when she mentioned that they had physically abused her. The fact that someone could beat a child was simply unfathomable to him though not unheard of. Like he had said families were different. As she talked about siblings in her family he listened as she rationalized her way through her own questions coming to a conclusion that in some way comforted her some.
He sat there holding her trying to add to the comfort that she had managed to find. To be honest just sitting there with her, holding her in his arms, was enough to just pass the time. They had learned quite a bit about each other in just a short time. Seconds were passing, turning into minutes. She shifted her head looking back at him. Her lips parted to ask another question. It was one that seemed, difficult. "Have you ever wanted children?" It was one he wasn't really expecting as genuine surprise showed on his face.
He shrugged his shoulders a bit as he met her eyes. He could see that the question wasn't easy for her to ask. **"Up till now I haven't really thought about it much."** He said rather seriously, more so than he expected. **"I was never with a girl long enough to even really contemplate that idea. Besides I was young and a family of my own was the furthest thing from my mind to be perfectly honest."** He held her in silence for a moment as his own mind worked through things. Absently his hand began rubbing her back again causing the lukku that was still there to brush against his arm.
Looking at her gave a small nod and smiled. **"Yes. Someday I would like to have children, to be a family. Protect, care for and love them. To pass on what I have learned. Yet it would be a bit scary to have little ones that depended on me."** He paused for a second as he nodded his head. **"Yes Tar'ja with the right woman I would love to have a family."** He said as a smile grew upon his face as he looked at her. He almost hopped that his smile would tell her he had the right woman, here right now, sitting on his lap.
**"What about you?"** He said softly. **"You now have your little one back at Doessenna's. By saving her she in a sense became your family."**

His look and his words, were lost on her. She wasn't good with that sort of thing yet, in some cases yes, but for this..well. it would take more time of logical thinking to understand those types of looks and emotional infections of tones.
At the mention of her little one she smiled faintly, a softer look she didn't even know she possessed. She thought of the bothans words, bringing Lyn'ara into the picture of the rebel leaders ship and her want to shoot him in the head for bringing possible danger to the girl. Frowning she nods "I never wanted children..they got in the way, they...always wanted something, needed a parent for something....she knew if she had one she didn't want it to grow up like she had.
But...her little one...she was simply thrust into her life and now..well...she couldn't think of not having her. "She is.." she says softly, looking to him "my little one. that I didn't think I needed or wanted until she was there." she chuckles faintly "does that...happen often in life? not knowing you need something until it's there?" he was one of those things, she didn't know she needed more to fix herself until he was there, that she needed emotions she hadn't learned, that she needed..the experiences that he had showed her.

Chase could see by the look on her face that she wasn't putting two and two together about what he was getting at when it came to her. ***Hmm I guess I cant be so subtle with her just yet.*** He chuckled inwardly to himself. She still had much to learn in that sense. That wasn't to say that she didn't understand emotions. Show her anger, fear, even hate and he was pretty sure that she understood those. But show her compassion, love, emotional inflections that might never have shown to her and it became understandable as to why she didn't pick up on it right away.
When Lyn'ara, her little one, came up he watched as he face softened as she spoke about her. How she had come to realize that now she has her she needed her in her life. He nodded with her as she mentioned it. His first experience with that was coming in tune with the Force. It was a part of him now. To be without it would be likened to missing a part of himself. His second experience was...well she was sitting on his lap talking to him.
A smile appeared on his face when she asked him if that happened a lot, about not knowing one needed something till it was there. Nodding he looked at her. **"Yeah it happens. I don't know about a lot but it does happen. It's happened to me. Once when I discovered my ability with the Force and…"** He paused for a moment as he simply looked at her. He saw her head cock to the side slightly as she waited for him to continue. **"When I met you.** He nodded again to her to make sure she understood. **"I didn't realize it at first but I do now. Does it sound odd? I've only known you for a short time but I can't imagine not knowing you or being her with you right now. Despite all the craziness going on in the galaxy this just…feels right."**

"...It's happened to me. Once when I discovered my ability with the Force and...When I met you." She met his gaze there, softer than she thought herself capable of, he felt that way for her? as she felt for him..it was a strange sensation to her; feel joy and happiness wrapped up in..
She gasps and rests a hand to her heart, surprise, had her heart stopped? no..no it was beating still but it had..had felt like it had.. Her gaze returns to him, he mad her feel so strange, but it was a good strange, something she rather enjoyed...was it because she enjoyed the punishment or was it that it was because he was the one that had brought it from her?
She realized perhaps later than she should have, that she have been silent in her musing for some time. Leaning in she brushes a kiss to his lips as though to apologize and thank him for the words he spoke of his feelings. Sighing softly she watches him lightly, her mind turning for another question, something that burned in her mind for so long...but in this moment...she had nothing; her thoughts were simply filled with him.
Smiling his smile she simply runs her fingers through his hair, oh she did love that hair...

He didn't have to wait long as he sat watching for a reaction. Her gasp was heard easily and he smiled as she placed a hand over her heart. They sat there simply looking at each other for several moments before either of them said or did anything.
Finally she gave him a kiss. Savoring the contact his smile returned when she broke it. No further questions were asked all she did was resume running fingers through his hair. Closing his eyes he leaned his head into her hand that was administering the wonderful sensation she was giving him.
Opening his blue eyes he sighed looking at her only to see her watching his reaction to what she was doing to his hair. He turned up one corner of his mouth in a smile. **"Tar'ja are you surprised that I feel the way I do towards you?"** the young Jedi said as he once again closed his eyes to the ministrations she gave his hair.

She nods her head lightly "I am...to not know of such things, to learn of them, and then to find someone feels them for me...is surprising." she tilts her head, a lekku falling over her shoulder "but a welcome one."
Her fingers continue to run through his hair, enjoying the softness; slowly she was beginning to develop a bit of a hair fetish; she wondered if that was odd...or bad...and then decided she really didn't care.
Smiling to him she tilts her head back the other way "Is..that bad?" she asks, unsure of things.

Shaking his head slightly to her question, as her hand continued to mess with his hair, he answered her. **"No it isn't bad in any way."** He smiled to reassure her.
He looked at the lekku that had fallen off her shoulder down over her chest. He liked the way the head band wrapped around them leaving lilac colored skin exposed in contrast to the black of the band. He brought up his other hand to trace the exposed skin on the one lekku. His fingers lightly brushing her skin.
As his fingers continued thier work he brought his gaze back up to her **"I just know that you have been given a crash course in emotions and feelings that up till now you've never really been exposed to. I don't want to scare you off or make you withdraw if the emotions get to intense."** The look on his face was sincere. **"Being hurt emotionally can hurt just as bad if not worse than physically."**

"I wouldn't know" she answers with a chuckle, to her it seemed like a thing to joke on, though she wondered if that was in bad taste...oh well.
A thought strikes her as she pauses her attention to his hair to take his hand from her lekku "I know that I felt heat rise to my cheeks with you at time, but why does naryen sometimes turns color? When she talks to you or looks at me? is she ill? Has it a name? why does the skin of the face change colors with situations? is it from emotions as well?"

She stopped her teasing of his hair only to hold his hand as she asked him about Nayren and why her face blushes or turns red like her own when she is with him. Taking a breath and letting it out he shrugged a bit.
**"A face turns red due to emotions. In the case with you and I it's called blushing. It can happen when one feels embarrassed or like earlier when we were kissing the passion between us rises and sometimes makes our cheeks a bit rosie. Which on you looks rather attractive."** He added seeing her cheeks turn a faint pink at the compliment. **"See just like that. With Nayren it comes from her anger towards me. Maybe not so much me per say but anger at what I am what I represent. If I'm reaching out I can feel the anger from her towards me. It can vary depending on what I have or haven't done. When she confronted me back in the bunk room her anger was so very strong."** He squeezed her hand as he smiled. **"Emotions can bring about any number of bodily responses. As to why she turns red when she sometimes looks at you…** He shrugged again **"I can only guess. She's been through a lot lately and maybe she still processing all that."**
He looked outside the cockpit. **"I wish I had all the answers that you seek. I'm getting better at reading people and understanding the emotions that I pick up through the Force yet I'm still no expert."**

Tar'ja nods her head to him, to both explanation and to his dismay of not having all the answers "I like your answers though, that's why I ask them." so the red coloring was blushing. at least she had a word for it and more of an understanding but why did Naryen blush around her sometimes? was it anger at the jedi that was spilling over? she'd have to ask the woman sometime.
Sighing with a faint grin the twi'lek traces patters on his shirt "I keep asking you questions but you have not yet asked me nearly as much...have you none?"

Smiling at her question Chase nodded. **"Of course I have more questions but just so you know I do not mind answering your questions at all. It's quite nice actually. Talking with someone I mean. Lets see now a question for you. Maybe one that isn't so serious."**
His brows furrowed for a moment as his hand that was at her back moved back and forth feeling the fabric of the clothing that she now wore. A grin slowly appeared as he looked her over. He wasn't so much looking at her that would make her uncomfortable but taking a good look at her clothing. While it was tight fitting and left little to ponder as it hugged her the curves of her lithe body the young Jedi began wondering if she ever wore anything more unpractical for one who did the kinds of work she did before. His eyes lit up as he asked her his question. **"Have you ever worn a dress?"** Immediately he closed his eyes and shook his head as he chuckled realizing that it didn't sound right.**"I mean…I know a dress would get in the way of acting quickly but have you ever worn one just for the sake of…wearing one.** He reached up as he spoke and traced a finger around her ear. **"Some time if we ever get a break and a chance to do something, just the two of us, I'd love to have dinner with you and have a real date. Does that sound appealing to you?"** Her eyes captivated him again as he looked at them. ***I never really stood a chance when it came to not falling for her. If only Garet could see me now. What would he think?***
Though Chase knew what the wizened Jedi would think. Garet was a follower of the living Force. Believing that the Force had a way of making things happen. Like bringing the five of them together. It was Chases's belief that the Force brought them all together for a reason. They all needed a way off Tatooine. Alone they all may still be there but together they made it off the planet.
