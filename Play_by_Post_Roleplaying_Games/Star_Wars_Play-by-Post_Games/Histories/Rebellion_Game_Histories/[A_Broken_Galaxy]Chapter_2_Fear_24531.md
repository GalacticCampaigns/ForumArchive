# [A Broken Galaxy]Chapter 2: Fear

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-05 13:56:06)

You're arrival at Chatos Five, the otherwise insignificant planet home to a Chatos base, was uncelebrated. The only greetings recieved were casual ones from those who chose to introduce themselves. Apart from that, the only kindness the newcomers recieved was being shown their individual rooms, and an extremely short and mostly unhelpful tour.
That had been one standard week ago. Since then, the only daily activities had been training sessions and attempting to find one's way around without getting lost. During this time, it had become easier to familiarise oneself with the general layout of the base. There appeared to be five general areas: the hangar, where all things mechanical were dealt with, the medical wing, which seemed to be woefully undermanned but thankfully quiet, the living quarters, where the individual rooms as well as the cafeteria were, the archives, housing knowledge both mundane and of the Force, and the training grounds, where both militia troops and paladins honed their combat skills. Each of these locations were alive with activity constantly, so at least there was little chance of getting bored.
-----
The hangar was filthy, moreso than the rest of the base, which was indeed saying something. The sounds of machinery flooded there air, accompanied by the aroma of grease and oil. Mechanics attended to ships, droids milled about everywhere, and in the centre of this cacophany, a green skinned Rodian shouted orders in his own tongue, apparently to anyone that would listen.
-----
The medical wing was spotless, in great contrast to the rest of the base. The white walls were almost blinding, and the smell of antiseptic accompanied everything. Individuals in white uniforms, obviously the medical staff, could be seen walking to and fro. While no serious cases were present, the area would be much more excited if that were the case, here and there could be seen people with minor injuries waiting to be treated. A sullustan mechanic with a light burn was leaning against a wall, his grubby appearance making him stand out. Sitting patiently across from him was a human man, whistling a nameless tune.
-----
In the cafeteria, tensions were high. A cathar woman sat calmly, with a bemused smile on her face as a dug standing beside her slamed the table, shouting angry words at her in his own language. Several others watched on, with varying expressions: some seemed amused, some upset, and more than one looked afraid.
-----
A crowd had gathered in the training grounds around a small arena. Loud cries, some cheers, some jeers, were constantly being made. While nothing could be seen from outside the crowd, the sound of lightsabers could be heard coming from the arena.
-----
In the archives, there was almost absolute silence. While many were present, most of them paladins, no sounds came from them save for the footsteps of those who were walking. Most sat, studying Jedi lore, or star charts, or pursuing any other number of intellectual pursuits in silence. Suddenly a loud snore broke the quiet in the air. All heads turned to the bearded figure which still smelled of alcohol, C'Boath. The miralukan beside him, Shoaneb, jabbed him sharply in the ribs, waking the old man with a start. He quietly muttered an apology and then closed his eyes, thankfully without resuming his snoring. Shoaneb shook his head and returned to his studies.
((*Alright everyone. I'm going to let you take your pick of where you want to start out*))

On this occasion, like most others, the Ryn known as Temin Hawke was to be found in the hangar. Though due to a series of circumstances he no longer had access to a ship of his own, he was still a wandering spirit (how could he not be, with the urge so ingrained in his entire species?), he found the proximity of interstellar vessels to be comforting. How he hated to be grounded, and the promise of ready access to the stars quelled that unease.
His time with the Chatos Academy had been a mostly fulfilling one, he had to admit. As a pilot, he was able to travel, satisfying his cultural need to never sleep in the same place two nights running. And he was doing good, he was sure.
Temin stroked his moustache and watched the bustle of pilots and mechanics around him.

Ever since his return to the Academy, Haesh had spent a great deal of his time in the training grounds, brushing up on his lightsaber skills. The events that had come to pass in the Jedi Temple had reminded him that he still had quite some bit to learn about the Force, and battle as well. Deciding to take one thing at a time, he had now decided to put his focus into lightsaber training, and had spent countless hours drilling with training droids and sparring partners alike.
Now he was taking a break, sweat dripping from his forehead after an intense session against three training remotes. Despite the fact that the droids only carried mild stunning lasers, every shot stung, and even though the numbers of shots getting through were far fewer than before, every once in a while one found home. He was also pondering the newcomers he had brought back with him, Shoaneb and C'Baoth. Happy as he was that he had managed to get them out of Jedi prison, he was still a bit disappointed that he hadn´t managed to get Jastra to come with them. She had seemed reasonable enough that he´d hate to see her stuck among the Jedi all her life.

The complex has been easy to navigate and much easier to memorize for Drex. His familiarity with Computers and Droid made him useful there. In many ways in was beneficial for Drex as much as it was for the Chatos.
Drex was waiting to meet with the Rodian in charge to begin some programming of the new and old droids. Drex was also waiting for terminal access for the network.
Drex was taking in the view of the Hangar as he was waiting looking for anything that he could use to help himself to.

Perhaps it was remnant programing left over from his time as a gladiator, but Gunner seems to be drawn to conflict of any kind. Or maybe he simply enjoyed employing combat subroutines. Either way, the combat droid found his way into the cafeteria.
Moving directly to the Dug, Gunner points his repeating blaster right in front of the alien. "Please, make my operational cycle. I don't need a reason to end your messy biological processes, but they come in handy."

Drex could find no available terminals within eyesight. However, the Rodian seems to notice that Drex wishes to talk to him, and thus turns to him as soon as he is free.
Immeadiatly the Rodian launches into rapid speech in his own tongue, laced with several more profanities than necessary. He then nods to the unassuming protocol droid with a strange insectoid head which had just caught up with him, unaware that Drex had understood every word.
"Master Greedo respectfully wishes to know why you wish to speak with him," the droid states. While this was indeed the general idea of what the rodian had said, it was by no means said in such a polite manner.
From some distance away Temin can see the exchange between Greedo and Drex. However, he could not hear them over the noises of the hangar, and had little chance to try and deduce what was being said before a mechanic carrying a large amount of machinery and promptly dropping it.
"I'm sorry, sir," the mechanic muttered from behind a faceless welding mask.
-------
In the training grounds, the crowd's cries grew louder as whatever had drawn them seemed to reach a climax. After a few moments, some of the crowd began to desperse, indicating it was over. From out of the crowd, a human male dressed in oddly flamboyant clothes and drenched in sweat walked towards where Haesh was resting, accompanied by encoraging words and a few pats on the back. As he drew nearer, a lightsaber could be seen hanging from his belt.
"Damn that floppy-eared bastard," he says, though the smile on his face seemed to imply that his words were not to be taken too seriously.
"That's the fifth time this month," he continues, sitting besided Haesh.
"Well, theres always next time. How's you're luck been today?"
------
The Dug stares daggers at the droid that dared to interupt him, but before he has a chance to speak, the Cathar woman cuts him off.
"I would back off if I were you. We don't want to waste any of our... valued comrades."
"I won't," the Dug says in plain basic, "Until you appologise.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-08 15:25:20)

"There´s no luck, my friend, only the Force"
For a moment Haesh looked serious there, but it was quickly replaced with a smile.
"But I might owe the Academy a few new training remotes. Got a bit carried away earlier. I don´t suppose you´d be up for some more sparring? Or perhaps I could try out that fellow you just went up against? By your description of him, I´m guessing a Gungan"

Drex laughs at the tenacious Rodian's attitude. He quickly responds in Rodese.

I can understand you quite fine Mr. Greedo, I am here to lend a hand as it appears you could use some competent help.

Drex looks off to the side at the mechanic who dropped the large amount of machinery.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Especially if they are all clumsy fools, it's far too hard to find good help these days.....but back to the point I was brought here for my skills I think you should make use of them, any terminals or droids that need some programming modifications. *Especially since any would be slicer could bring this place down around us.....you should consider having an expert like me upgrading your network and droids.*

'Not to worry,' Temin replied kindly, 'but you should carry more manageable loads in future. Here, I'll help you with this lot.'
He crouched down to pick up an armload of the parts.
'Where to?' asked the Ryn, straightening up and looking at the anonymous mechanic's welding mask.

This was something simplistic for Gunner. "Combat Protocols Initiated." The droid responded simply. charging up his repeating blaster, and opening fire on the dug.

Zeke had spent most of the time back at the Academy alone, meditating in his room. On occasion, he did wander out to watch the other students train or grab a bite to eat, but most of the time he was alone.
It was during one of his meditation moments, as he stood on his hands in he center of his quarters, that he felt her. He quickly rolled onto his feet and paused. It was definitely her.
His master had returned.
Clipping his belt back around his waist, he jogged down to the hangar to greet her.

The man smiled at Haesh as he spoke.
"Yeah, no luck, right," he said, running his hand through jet black hair.
"Well, give me a moment to catch my breath, and we'll see just how much the Force is with you, eh?"
He extended a hand in greating.
"Name's Valin. You are?"
------
Greedo remain silent for a moment, then burst into laughter. He waved the protocol droid away, and then began speaking to Drex in a much more conversational tone.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"Ah, yes. At last, someone I can speak with. Indeed, I've been looking for someone who isn't completely incompetent."

</details>

He then motioned for Drex to follow him as he walked through the chaos of the hangar towards some unknown destination.
Elsewhere in the hangar, the mechanic and Temin had finally collected all fallen machinery. In response to Temin's question, the mechanic gestured with a shoulder, the only available body part.
"Over there, my bench is on the other side of the hangar."
As the mechanic began to walk, the noise in the hanger increased as a ship began to dock. The chaos seemed to reach a climax, indicating that someone important was arriving. Once landed, a single female exited the ship. Though she was dressed as any other Paladin, anyone who knew even the slightest about Chatos knew that she was anything but.
It was the Paladin Blademaster, Leia Amidala.
-------
With one shot, the dug fell to the floor. With the exception of the cathar he had been confronting, the entire cafeteria exploded in uproar. Weapons were drawn, threats were made, and the entire situation could have ended in more casualties than the latest battle with the Republic. That is until a single voice roared above it all.
"STOP!"
All eyes turned to the large, muscular man who had spoken. His eyes scanned the room intimidating all whom they fell upon. With an aura of authority, he gave one single order.
"Stand down," he said, his gaze finally resting on Gunner.

*Ah, a famous lady* Temin thought to himself, *talented and pretty too*.
Outwardly he grinned and carried on with his previous activity, striding quickly over to the mechanic's work area and depositing the parts.
'Know where she's been?' he asked his new comrade, gesturing over in Leia's direction to make sure the man understood the object of hisquestion.

### **Avarna** (2010-01-13 13:13:45)

The Droid powered down his weapon. He couldn't identify the man that had stopped those around them. Neither did the droid care. Taking the corpse by the neck, Gunner lifted what was left of the dug off the ground, and turned to leave. "I'll properly dispose of this."
With that Gunner left the cafeteria, going to the nearest garbage shoot. Where he'd check the dug for valuables, before dropping it down.

Haesh took the man´s hand, and felt it was a bit moist. He had worked hard indeed.
"Name´s Haesh. Where´s the training sabers kept these days? I´ve been away for quite some time"

By the time Leia set foot outside her ship, Zeke was standing in the hangar doorway. He smiled in spite of himself. It had been too long, between his mission and hers, that it almost didn't feel like they were master and apprentice. It wasn't as if he was her only student, but he'd been taken under her wing and taught the ways of the lightsaber--he'd never handled one before he met her. He briskly crossed the hangar, then bowed deeply. "Master." His smile was almost a grin now, despite his best efforts to the contrary. It was good to see her again.

"That's not how we do things," the man said to Gunner, standing between him and the exit. He shot a look a Gamorrean and a Duros who had the misfortune of being too close, and said, "Take him to the infirmary."
The two approach Gunner, neither willing to confront the droid, waiting for him to let go of the dug.
------
"Over here," Valin said to Haesh, walking forward and expecting Haesh to follow. As he did this, a hooded Gungan exited from the almost dispersed crowd.
"I'll get you next time, you overgrown amphibian," Valin said, getting only a nod in response.
------
"Not really," the mechanic said, "but then again, she is the Blademaster, so a better question would probably be what brought her back?"
"Anyways, thank you for your help. I don't think I got your name. I'm Rhen."
------
Leia grinned back a Zeke, apparently just as glad to see him as he was to see her. Dropping all pretense of formality, she walked down the hangar and lightly punched him.
"Just the guy I wanted to see. How've you been, Rookie?" she asked, using her favourite nickname for him.

Gunner drops the remains of the Dug onto the floor without any undo ceremony.
"If you insist." The droid replies. Taking a better look at the organic that was causing him difficulty in his attempt to remove the refuse from the mess hall.

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-21 12:26:39)

Zeke took the punch in stride, used to her mannerisms and not really minding it. "Better now that I'm here and not off on some wild recruitment mission," he answered. "We got ourselves a few newbies, and they are . . . and interesting group, you could say. I'm not sure I trust all of them, but hey, I don't have to. I'm still a rookie, right?" His grin widened. "So how'd your mission go? Heck, where'd you go?"

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-22 10:56:45)

'Temin,' the Ryn replied, 'I'm a pilot so you'll probably see me around. And I'll probably see you, but not recognise you because of that mask.'
He grinned as he offered his hand for a shake.
'Well I'll be off. Work hard.'
Temin walked away, deciding in that instant to get a better look at Leia before leaving the hangar. Curiosity had always been one of his strongest character traits.
Approaching the Blademaster he soon realised she was conversing with another person. Deciding it would be rude to simply interrupt the conversation, he settled himself down on a crate nearby and pulled out his sabacc deck.
Using both his hands and his prehensile tail he practices the fortune-telling his species is famous for as a useful way to pass the time. For the sheer amusement of it he tries to divine the outcome of introducing himself to Leia.

Haesh followed behind the man, and gripped one of the training sabers. As he ignited the blade, it looked just like a regular blade. While they weren´t lethal, he knew just how well they could sting, as he had experienced in his training sessions with some of the more skilled swordsmen at the academy, including Count Dooku, the man who had trained him in how to fend off and ward against the dark side.
He looked over at Valin, and started to walk towards the training grounds.
"Ready when you are"

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-22 23:05:06)

Gunner studies the man in front of him carefully. His face remained unmoving, his dark eyes staring directly at the droid. His clothes appeared casual, baggy pants and a sleaveless shirt, so it was unclear if he held some sort of rank, or if he simply was able to order others through intimidation. Regardless, now that the droid had released the dug, the two whom he had ordered rushed forward quickly, not wishing to stay and be taken up in this standoff.
"You will come with me," the man growled. All eyes were either on him or gunner, with the exception of the Cathar woman who seemed to have started all this. She simply had returned to her food.
------
As Temin walked away, he could see that Rhen had already started working with the machinery, though not without waving goodbye.
As Temin attempted his fortune telling, interesting results came up.
The Star, a person of importance.
Opposing this was Moderation.
Next Endurance.
Demise.
The Destroyed Starship.
And finally, representing the near future, the Wheel, or chance.
All this meant that he was no more certain of the future than he was when he started.
-----
"Oh, nothing too interesting," Leia said with a grin, "Just the usual saving the galaxy deal. Managed to find a little adventure on this ice ball called Hoth."
"But enough talking about me. I'm afraid I'm not here on a pleasure visit. If you would follow me."
Leia motioned for Zeke to follow her as she walked away from her ship and, unknowingly, towards Temin.
------
Valin grinned, igniting his own saber and following his new sparring partner.
"So you say," he said, smile plastered over his face. He assumed a battle posture, with one hand holding the saber directly in front of him, pointing towards Haesh.
"I insist you open."

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **Avarna** (2010-01-22 23:17:48)

There was nothing special about the particular organic, At lest to Gunners optical sensors. With that he walks directly past the man, and beings making his way back to the hanger. He saw no reason why he should obey the man any further.
To be perfectly honest, the gladiator droid couldn't recall a solid reason why he'd come to this particular place. And decided to go and demand an answer from the freighter pilot that brought him here. Temin, the Ryn.

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-23 00:49:38)

"Very well..."
Spinning the lit saber around in one hand, the Yakora smiled and began to pace in a circling motion, following his opponent. Suddenly darting forward, he brought the blade in on his opponent with a horizontal sweep to the side.

'The Star,' Temin spoke aloud as he dealt the cards, 'yes, that's exactly right. The opponent is Moderation? Hm, impossible for me to say who or what that might be. Conscious: Endurance. Yes, yes I can see how that fits. Subconscious: Demise. Worrying, if literal. In the past, the Destroyed Starship. Tragic indeed. And is there better hope for the future? The Wheel; chance. Could go either way.'
'And what in creation is that all supposed to mean?' The Ryn exclaimed loudly, looking down at his cards with some dismay.
Truthfully he didn't know since his best guesses only applied to the most innocent card, but overall it did not seem a happy reading. Not a happy reading at all.

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-31 17:07:45)

Valin smiled and parried the Yakora's blow, and then followed up with one of his own. However, the attack was so full of unnecissary flourishes that it was relativly simple to predict.
*((Both Haesh and Valin missed))*
------
The man watched gunner leave the cafeteria without moving to stop him. However, as gunner left he could be seen speaking into a comlink in a whisper.
Gunner had little difficulty navigating his way to the hangar, the best location to find a pilot. However, once within the hangar, finding Temin proved much more difficult. The chaos surrounding the droid made it almost impossible to stand in one location for long, let alone conduct a thorough seach.
------
As Temin sat reading his sabaac cards, an ugnaut approached Leia and exchanged a few short words, before rushing over to were Temin sat.
"Hey, you're a pilot, right?" the little alien asked.
"You're not doin' nuthin', are ya? The Lady Blademaster said she needs her a pilot."
------
Greedo was halfway to leading Drex to where ever he was headed, when he pulled out a comlink. Apparently someone of status had called, as Greedo's only replies were "Yes" and "Sir". After a few moments of this, he looks at Drex with a smile.
"I've got the perfect man for the job," he says, smirking menacingly at Drex. Putting away his comlink, he said to Drex, "Change of plans. We've got a special assignment for you."

After sending the ugnaught away, Leia turned to Zeke, walking backwards.
"We're going to need a good pilot," she explained to him.
"Tell me, Zeke," she asked, turning back around, "What do you know about pirates?"

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-31 18:23:11)

'Am I a pilot?' Temin replied, his face near-exploding in a delighted grin, '*Am I a pilot?* Only one of the best you'll ever meet, mate. And definitely the most eager pilot to be off this rock. I'll take the job.'
He quickly gathered his sabacc cards and returned them to their case. As he did so, he wondered about his reading. The future of the Blademaster involved chance, and now he was part of that future. Exciting, and potentially dangerous.
*Look before you leap, but leap anyway*, the Ryn thought, picking up his pack and striding decisively over to Leia.
'They tell me you need a pilot and fate has brought you one of the best,' he said with conviction, offering his hand. Then added somewhat enigmatically: 'Besides, the cards suggest you may need me along for this one.'
With barely a pause he continued on to introductions.
'Temin Hawke, born and raised starskimmer and talented in a few other areas besides that you may find a boon. Forgive my ego, but a fellow knows what he's good at. You of course are famous, although I confess not to know your companion.'

"I know a few things, been associated with more than a few in my past," he started, before the Ryn interrupted.
He looked the Ryn up and down a few times. "You aren't the only pilot to make your way here. I've been known to handle a ship decently well. Tell us, Hawke, what are your qualifications?" What he meant was, "How can we trust you?" The Paladins had been known to take in more than their share of shady characters, Zeke included among them, so he knew enough to be wary of everyone.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-01-31 20:54:19)

Catching his opponents blade on his own, Haesh adds his second hand to the weapon, swinging away the others blade. Stepping into the opening, the Yakora spins his blade around and brings a heavy, two-handed slash down upon his opponent.
((Lightsaber +4, 2d8+4 Stun Damage. I´ll use Unbalancing Block +10 if I´m hit by his attack))

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-01 11:01:32)

'What are your qualifications, he asks!' Temin exclaimed as though sharing a joke, 'well for starters, I'm a Ryn. What does that mean? It means I've got a cultural disposition to travel so strong it may as well be genetic, hammered into me since I was in my cot by two smugglers for parents. And all that in turn means that I've learned to fly like no one's business, except yours and mine obviously, and a life on the seedy side of the spacelanes has taught me other useful skills beside. And yet this poor grubby soul of mine is honest enough to be upfront about my background. You're looking at a gem of an applicant, and if I seem overexcited its only because I've been grounded for too long, not because of any kind of disorder. Not one that's been diagnosed anyway.'
Temin beamed, his eyes twinkling in a manner familiar to anyone who had ever met a specimen of the cross-species phenomenon known as the "rogue". This particular example was clearly enjoying himself immensely. At this point he didn't much care whether he was making a good or bad showing of himself, because he was having fun. Fun was as important as travel. No, fun was *more* important than travel because travel had to be fun.
'I also have the skill of looking distinguished,' the Ryn said, running the fingers of his left hand along his moustache and giving a wink. 'Oh, and my tail is good enough to work as a third hand. That's *handy*, eh?'

### **Avarna** (2010-02-01 12:14:00)

It took some time for the droid to pick out the Ryn from among the rest of the background clutter taking place in the hanger. Gunner immediately visualized how better organized the place would be without the messy organics.
Rudely the droid approached Temin, unconcerned that he was still engaged in conversation with another organic. "Why did you bring me here?" He asks gruffly. "I've seen nothing here that is advantageous to restoring my lost combat efficiency."

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-03 10:20:39)

"Well then," Leia said to Zeke before Temin arrived, "hopefully that means I won't have to do much more explaining."
After Temin's introduction, Leia extends her hand in greeting.
"Good to meet you, Temin. Don't mind Zeke, he's always a little grumpy in-"
Interrupted by Gunner, the Blademaster stared at the droid.
"A friend of yours?" she asked Temin.
-----
Greedo's eyes scanned the entire area, before settling on a small gathering of individuals near one of the exits.
"Speak of the devil," he muttered, before looking more closely at the group.
"Ah, the Lady Blademaster. Come, my friend," he says to Drex, "Let us make introductions."
-----
Haesh's lightsaber slices towards Valin unimpeaded. If it had been an actual dual, the blade would have cleanly sliced his head from his shoulders. As it was, it simply caused a slight shock.
Overcoming surprise, Valin was about to renew his assault, when suddenly a shrill and obviously female voice resounded through the training grounds.
"VALIN!!!"
Haesh could see the colour visibly drain from his sparing partner's face.

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-03 12:25:17)

Ignoring Gunner for a few moments, Temin shook the Blademaster's proffered hand.
'Absolutely not,' he then replied to her, the eyes which she must already be used to being cheerful hardening, 'I agreed to bring this droid along on my last run but then discovered how maladjusted the thing is. I don't think I'd want it on a ship of mine again.'
He turned to Gunner.
'If you're unsatisfied with life on Chatos I'm sure you could get permission to leave on one of the upcoming transport shuttles. As long as its not piloted by me. Now if you don't mind, we're discussing business here.'

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-03 16:17:33)

Deactivating his training saber as soon as he felt it hit flesh, Haesh hoped he had been able to spare Valin the worst sting from the weapon. While they weren´t deadly by any means, the training sabers did sting a decent punch. Plus, he needed practice in being quick on the switch, it was part of his lightsaber training, flicking it on and off at great speed.
Dropping the hand holding the dead weapon to his side, he took a look at his sparring partner. It seemed the voice belonged to someone he didn´t want to hear from at the moment. Broadening his face into a smile, the Yakora looked around to try and find the woman in particular.

Gunner looks intently at the Ryn, before simply turning around and dissappearing into the crowd.
As if to replace him, a Rodian approaches the group. Trailing behind him is a human male, whom Zeke recognizes as Drex. The Rodian says something in Rodese, and then gestures to his companion.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"Lady Blademaster, I hope I'm not interrupting. However, I have found a... young prodigy, who has offered me his services. I was simply wondering if you perhaps would have any use for him."

</details>

------
The woman shouting for Valin was not difficult to spot. Dressed in the white clothes of the medical wing staff, she stood out from the training soldiers and paladins.
"Valin Draco!" she shouts, having made her way to him, "What are you doing!"
"Now, wait a moment," Valin says, with an appeasing smile unlike his usual one, "Think of your condition for a mom-"
"MY condition?!? You're the one who just snuck out of the medical wing!"
Valin offers a pleading look to Haesh as the woman then launches into a long, drawn out rant.

Instantly somewhat confused, Haesh shot Valin a wondering look, and then turned to the woman. He had no idea of who she was, but she did have the look and tone of a mother about her. Oh well, the least he could do was to try and help his newfound friend out of the trouble he was in. Raising his hands to try and interrupt her talking, he gave away a disarming smile.
"Excuse me, milady, but I think I can explain this. You see, there are some among the paladins here that believe Valin has been making real progress lately, and they sent me to verify this. And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This man is destined for something great, I tell you that"
It was mostly guesswork and intuition, but whether she was Valin´s mother, girlfriend, sister, or whatever (he found it hard to tell among humans sometimes), he suspected she´d respond well to his praise, and hopefully calm down.

Zeke folded his arms across his chest as he stood behind Leia, perfectly falling back into the role of decoy bodyguard--in truth, it was Leia who could be protecting him, as he was her apprentice. He glared at the droid, ignoring Leia's jab, then turned to the Rodian. "I'm sorry, I didn't get any of that. Please tell me someone here speaks Rodese."

'Not myself,' Temin responded, shrugging, shaking his head, and putting on an apologetic expression as though not knowing the language is somehow something to be ashamed of.
'It may as well have been Binary for all I could understand,' he continued, 'though I am fluent in both Bocce and Huttese if our Rodian friend here knows either one.'

Leia smiled at Zeke and Temin, saying, "No worries. I understood most of that. Seems we have another able body willing to help us. Good, would you all follow me. I'd rather give a briefing somewhere quieter."
She turned and led the way out of the hangar, followed shortly by Drex, who appeared to be attempting to start a conversation with the Blademaster. The Rodian nodded as though he had done some good thing, and then turned back to the rest of the hangar and resumed barking orders.
------
"I mean no disrespect, sir," the woman said, appearing to have calmed slightly, "but regardless of his progress, I'll not have him leaving the medical wing without my permission."
Valin put a hand on the woman's shoulder, apparently convinced that the danger had passed.
"There's no need to worry. I'm all right," he reassured her. Turning to Haesh he said, "Now, I do believe introductions are in order."
The woman smiled, extending a hand to Haesh.
"I'm sorry, how rude of me. I'm Byra Fenn-Draco, head of the medical facilities here. Hopefully I won't see much of you over there, unlike this one," she says, jerking her thumb in the direction of Valin, who offers a sarcastic hurt expression.

'You're the Boss, Lady Blademaster,' Temin replied when Leia suggested the group relocate to a more suitable location for a meeting.
'I hope this mission requires me to pilot something cool,' he mused to himself as they walk, grinning at the possibilities coming to life in his mind.

Zeke was suspicious of anyone he couldn't understand (and everyone in general), but Lea trusted him, so he did too. He trailed behind the others, following them back to the briefing room.

Leah led the group on until the sounds of the hanger were all but gone. Eventually they came to an undecorated door somewhere in the vicinity of the living quarters. Passing through they found a room which was as nondescript as the door. The only things of note were a rectangular table and several chairs surrounding it.
The Blademaster sat at the head of the table and motioned for the others to take a seat as well.
"Well," she started, "I'd like to get started as soon as possible, but it seems we're one short. Until our missing body arrives, how about we make sure that the team knows who their working with?"

Taking the womans hand, Haesh returns the smile.
"Haesh-Heren, although my friends just call me Haesh. Which means if you don´t, you´ll pretty much be alone in this place not to. If I may be so bold as to ask, what exactly is his condition? Because as far as I could see, there was no injury impairing his ability to fight"

"Well, apart from the imparment up here," Byra said, pushing Valin's head to make a point, "he recently just recovered from a serious poisoning. Well, at least he *seems* to have recovered. We *wanted* him to stay put so that we could do a few further tests, but..."
She was interrupted by a voice from behind Haesh.
"Um, excuse me," the voice said, accompanied by a slight tug on the back of Haesh's clothing. The voice belonged to a short reptillian, probably a Trandoshan youngling, who, judging by the robes he wore, was in training to become a paladin.
"You're name's Haesh, right?" he asked earnestly.

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-16 19:37:05)

Haehs raises an eyebrow towards Valin.
"Poison? You should watch better what you eat pal..."
At the sudden tug of his robes, the Yakora spins around, requiring a moment to adjust his eyes slightly downward to meet the eyes of the short Trandoshan. He smiled friendly to the youth.
"Well, technically it isn´t, but like I just said, that´s what all my friends call me. So I guess that makes the correct answer yes. And what might your name be?"

Zeke settled into a chair to Leia's left, folded his arms across his chest and gazed steadily at the others. When none of them spoke, to introduce himself, Zeke took it upon himself. "I'm Zeke Coltrider, apprentice to the Blademaster here. I've only been here a few months, but that's longer than any of you, I think. Just watch yourselves. Not everyone can be trusted." Hopefully that was mysterious enough for them.

---

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-18 13:32:50)

Temin stared at Zeke for several seconds then burst out laughing.
'Are you for real?' he asked, then turned to Leia, 'is he for real?'
The Ryn chuckled and shook his head.
'Okay, so the Galaxy's all direness, doom, and gloom for you. Got it. Me, I like to keep things light. Temin Hawke, I'm a pilot. Used to be a smuggler, so I'm a pretty sneaky guy too, as well as savvy. I'm the kind of guy mister dark-as-deep space over here doesn't trust, but you're better off with me on your team than off it.'
He winked in Zeke's direction and offered the apprentice a grin.
'Cheer up buddy, even with a war on the Galaxy's not such a bad place.'

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

Zeke couldn't help but let a small smile cross his face. "You assume too much. With the way the Chatos recruit, it wouldn't take much for, say, a CIS spy to infiltrate the organization, get close to one of the Paladins, and conduct a kidnapping. Or maybe the Republic would place a dark Jedi within our ranks to sabotage our efforts." He leaned back in his seat, letting his arms drop to his sides. "We must be vigilant, Temin, but that doesn't mean we're doomed. It just means we have to be smart. I've been known to be light-hearted from time to time, but a mission is still a mission."

---

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-18 17:47:01)

'On that point I find myself agreeing with you,' the Ryn replies, suddenly grave, 'we must indeed be smart, for this mission may have the potential for great fortune or great disaster. I read the Wheel in the Lady Blademaster's future, and that is chief among the reasons I am here to lend my aid.'

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

Leia could be seen smiling at the banter between Temin and Zeke.
"I can tell you two will get along," she said. Then turning to Drex, she asked, "And you?"
Drex simply smiled.
"Drex Void, at all of your service," he said introducing himself.
"Our dour friend and I have met, but as for the rest of us, I am simply the best you could have gotten to tag along. Stealth and technology are my specialties, although I will say that I can hold up my own in combat if it comes to that."
"Well, that only leaves one more," Leia observed.
-------
"My name's Ruskk," the Trandoshan boy said, with more than a little bit of pride.
"Remember that, 'cause I'm gunna be a famous Paladin one day!"
Both Valin and Byra seem amused by this, with Byra patting the boy on the head, much to his dismay.
"Well, aren't you adorable!" she said. Valin's smile widens as he whispers to Haesh, "She can't wait to have one of her own, delusions of grandeur and all."
"It's no delusion!" Ruskk protested, before his eyes suddenly widened as though he remembered something.
"Oh yeah! Mr. Haesh, the Lady Blademaster wants you!"

---

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-18 18:42:39)

Haesh laughed at the boys statement. He suspected that he should say something responsible and "senior", about how fame and glory were not the goals to crave for a Paladin, but he decided not to. The dream of fame was one of the kids dreams that tended to fade away with age, so instead he decided to offer some encouragement.
"I´ll remember the name, but promise me this boy. Before you go off on some wild adventure in the Galaxy, you have to find and beat me in a lightsaber duel, ok? You can ask Valin here about what it takes to do that"
Still smiling, the Yakora asked the boy where to find the Lady Blademaster, and then headed off to see her, wondering what she could want with him.

While waiting for the mysterious last member of the mission's "team", Temin opens up his sabacc deck and with a deft sweep fans the cards out on the table. With both hands and his prehensile tail he plucks the cards from his reading of Leia from among the others and places them in formation. As he gathers the remaining cards and neatly shuffles them back into a deck, his gaze focuses entirely on the fortune reading and he whistles quietly through his beak.

Haesh leaves a highly aggitated Ruskk with Byra, with Valin looking on in amusement. Following the youngling's directions, he finds himself at the appointed meeting place. He enters, seeing Drex, Kyle, Temin, and the Blademaster herself.
"Ah, and her he is," Leia said, rising to greet the last entrant of the room.
"Master Dooku spoke well of you. I hope you won't dissappoint."

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-23 09:15:57)

Offering a small nod towards the Blademaster, as well as the other assembled people - some he recognized, some he didn´t - Haesh looked around for a place to sit and sat down.
"Hopefully not milady, but if you wanted someone to recite classic poetry for you, I am afraid you are out of luck. Then of course, I hardly think the good count would recommend me for such skills either..."
Trailing of his voice, the Yakora took a quick scan over the assembled group again, just to familiarize with their faces, and then turned back to Leia.
"So, since I guess you were waiting for me, let´s get started"

---

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-23 11:27:37)

The Ryn at the table smiled at the newcomer, while drawing the sabacc cards in front of him in and returning them to their deck as fast as he had previously dealt them out.
'The mission requires three Jedi, does it?' he asked shrewdly, adding: 'my danger sense is going off something crazy right now.'

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **Anonymous** (2010-02-23 14:28:03)

"No need to worry, Temin," Leia said, addressing the Ryn's concern, "Only two Paladins are needed for this. I won't be tagging along, sadly."
Clearing her throat, she continued.
"I suppose it's time to get to business, then. Alright, the focus of our mission is this man."
Leia places a small holoprojector on the table, which hums to life and creates the image of a blond haired human male.
"This is Chiros, one of our recruiters. The plan was for him to take some new recruits from Teth to Dantooine, hopefully away from the Republic's eye's."
"But if things went as planned," Drex interjected, "you wouldn't be talking to us."
"Exactly. En route to Dantooine, the ship which they had bought passage on was attacked. Pirates who called themselves the Midnight Fang or some such stupid name. Our informants have discovered that they're led by a Togorian named Fassool, and their home base is in Tibanopolis on Bespin. We've also learned that they have a preference for taking prisoners.
And here's where things get interesting. No one knows what happens to their prisoners. They aren't ransomed, sold, or set free. They just... dissappear.
Since the Republic is too busy fighting a war to deal with it, we're sending you to Tibanopolis. There, we want you to investigate the pirate's activities, and find out where their prisoners are, specifically our people, if possible."

After hearing the news that Leia would not be accompanying them, Zeke tuned everything else out. He'd been expecting, hoping, that his master would be joining them. He'd seen too little of her in the past weeks . . . what was the point of an apprentice-master arrangement if the two never trained together?
He shook his head and returned his focus to the briefing, hearing just enough to know they were headed to Tibanopolis, and the bit about the pirates and prisoners that followed. "So when do we leave?"

---

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-04 20:49:36)

"Immediately," Leia responded to her apprentice. Picking up her holoprojector, she moved to the door.
"I will show you to your transport," she said, already in the doorway and expecting the others to follow.
"If you have any other questions, be quick and ask them on the way."

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-03-04 21:53:43)

'No questions,' Temin commented as he put his sabacc deck in his pocket and sprang to his feet, 'the whole thing seems easy to sum up: investigate stupidly named pirates; discover whereabouts of missing agents; rescue them if within our means or call for backup if not. Right?'
Without waiting for confirmation, the Ryn grinned toothily as he followed Leia from the room.
'Sounds like a cakewalk.'

Following in stride behind Leia and Temin, Haesh casually corrected the blaster holster at his hip.
"Yeah, it should be a blast, but I´ll bet you 5 credits that they will insist on trying to kill us"

---

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-03-05 08:45:26)

Temin laughed at Haesh's comment and shook his head, rejecting the bet.
'If I *had* five credits for every time someone tried to kill me, I'd be a wealthy man already and wouldn't be ferrying your butts around the spacelanes. No deal!'

Zeke shook his head as he followed the others, listening to their chatter. His mind was still on Leia, disappointed she wouldn't be following. He jogged around the others to catch up to her. "What's keeping you away, Master?"

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-09 11:38:35)

"Oh, you know, this and that," Leia said with a smile. In his time of knowing her, that phrase had come to mean, "Top secret, not allowed to talk about it," and other such things.
"Anyway," she continued, "You should be fine. The mission's simple enough, and I daresay you may be approaching the day when you won't need a master anymore."
"But don't worry; we still have lots of time for me to bully you."
Still smiling, Leia finally led the way to an unusually deserted section of the hangar bay. Though the sounds of the hangar were ever present, here they seemed slightly more far off.
Before the group was a starship of unique design. The cockpit appeared to face upwards and the engines downwards, rather than the usual starship configuration of front and back. Mechanics and the like seemed to be bustling around it doing last minute inspections. Turning to address everyone, Leia began.
"This is our newest ship. Just recently constructed from new blueprints we've aquired, it hasn't even been named yet. Sure it seems a little... odd, but I'll guarantee its the fastest thing we have available. Are we ready for takeoff?"
Though the question seemed aimed at everybody, one of the mechanics in particular responded. Removing her welding mask revealled a female human with short hair so dirty it was hard to determine what its initial colour should have been.
"Ready when you are!"
*((The ship is a Firespray-31, in case it wasn't clear from the description))*

It would be impossible to adequately describe the expression on Temin's face upon seeing the ship, as his expression seemed torn between being awed; eager; impressed; excited; proud; and even amused, to the extent that his face was no longer enough to contain them all and he settled for spending a moment with his jaw dropped.
'Thank you for providing me such a shiny toy,' he thereafter exclaimed, 'even if I die horribly on this mission at least I'll have fun doing it.'
He approached the female mechanic, and would appear nothing less than a calm and collected professional were it not for the fact that his tail wagged back and forth behind him.
'So what's it packing?' he queried, gesturing at the sarcophagus-shaped craft.

"Well," the mechanic explained, "she's pretty lightly armed. Mostly built her for speed. Single set of pilot controlled blaster cannons, combat thrusters, class 2 hyperdrive. Plus a few hidden compartments and tonnes of room for modification."
"Go ahead and check her out, Temin," the mechanic said with a smile, obviously aware of his interest in the ship.

Ever unprofessional, Temin whooped his joy and excitement and practically scampered up the boarding ramp to make a rapid tour of the ship, its facilities, and its systems. He ended the investigation in the cockpit, where he sat and familiarised himself with the firespray's control scheme.

"Well, he seems eager to be off," Drex said with a smile as he followed Temin into the ship.
"Don't worry," the mechanic said, "I'll try and make sure he takes off some time this week."
She then spoke into a comlink, her voice coming out a corresponding speaker in the cockpit of the ship.
"Hey, Temin, you there? You ready to go?"
Just outside, Leia bowed to the Paladins in farwell.
"The Force be with both of you."

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-25 12:47:44)

Haesh returns the bow to Leia, and proceeds inside the ship, looking for a nice place to sit down. Spacetravel was something that didn´t get him particularly excited, so he would probably sleep most of the journey, or chat with the others if they preferred that. Anyway, he knew how some people could be, and didn´t put too much trust in the mechanics words that they might be leaving today after all. A pilot who´d just gotten a new toy was a sight to behold...

## Re: Chapter 2: Fear

### **simplyscribed** (2010-03-25 20:47:47)

The Ryn was in fact already about as familiar as he could possibly be with the controls without actual experience of the ship's responses. That considered, the simple task of accepting the incoming comms transmission and responding in turn proved no obstacle.
'I was ready yesterday!' Temin arrogantly exclaimed, 'the best way to learn is through experience, and I reckon this thing should handle like a dream in any case. Any quirks I should know about, Rhen?'
Truthfully, he wasn't one hundred percent sure the female mechanic currently conversing with him actually *was* the same individual in a welding mask he'd helped not all that long ago, but she seemed to know *his* name after all...
