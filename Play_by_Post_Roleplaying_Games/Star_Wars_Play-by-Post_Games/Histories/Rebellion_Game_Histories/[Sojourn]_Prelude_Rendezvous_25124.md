It has been only two weeks since the chaotic day on that backwater planet. Roaming from planet to planet retracing places Aala visited, talked about or even mentioned. What are you looking for? What ... who was she? To date Aala was the closest you have come to this rebellion. You have not seen any sign of these rebels save the odd holo imperial broadcast denouncing rebels as traitors to be hunted down.
Resting inside the lounge port of the Aala's Dream you stair upwards through the semi transparent dura steel plating watching the stars wisp overhead. 2-1B stands to one side holding a try of dried fruits in hand it stairs blankly at the far wall. R2-SQ rolls through the room only to stop plug into a data port the beep his way out continuing his programed routine.
Running low on fuel and supplies your trip has been diverted to the near by planet Ord Barjo. The nav computer listed it as a trade world with a tropical tropical climate. Located within imperial space the atmosphere is labeled as toxic. The planet itself is dotted with domed cities towns and outposts. The planet trades in ore minerals as well as various gasses. The auto toned voice of Captain Rucks suddenly burst through the ships PM system. "Master the ISD Dictator has granted us permission to enter the planets atmosphere. We have received docking instructions, should I proceed?"

The auto toned voice of Captain Rucks suddenly burst through the ships PM system. &quot;Master the ISD Dictator has granted us permission to enter the planets atmosphere. We have received docking instructions, should I proceed?&quot;

"Proceed Captain. No reason to give our friends down there reason to percieve our arrival as anything but what it is, nice and normal." Xasst turned his gaze from the dura steel plating to the R2 unit rolling through the room. "SQ give me a hand over at this terminal and let's bring up what we can on the local scene, see if we can piece together the local power structure, whose the governor and is he the one running things here and if not who is the power player pulling the strings." Xasst thinks back as he often does to the day he lost Aala and seemingly through his lot in with the upstart rebels she was aiding. He hadn't had any luck so far backtracking her contacts on any of the other planets he visited that she was running supplys for but maybe his luck would change here. The Correlian Senator had implied Aala was a part of the growing Rebellion against the Empire, but he was in desperate need of help at the time, could he have lied to Xasst? It was something that the Falleen had been pondering as he tried to collaborate Bel Iblis' story by visiting the planets Aala had last visited. He touched the hull of the Ghtroc freighter as he often did thinking of his lost Twi'lek companion. The Aala's Dream was all he had left of her besides his memories and the hole in his heart.
"Master acknowledgement has been sent to the ISD Dictator," Captain Rucks called over the intercom. "Thank you Captain, take us in nice and easy no showboating," the Falleen replied. "Now SQ, let's see what we can pull up on Ord Barjo."
Xasst Skills Deception +10, Gather Information +10, Initiative +8, Knowledge Galactic Lore +9, Knowledge Bureaucracy +9, Perception +8, Stealth +8, Use Computer +9
R2-SQ Skills Mechanics +13 Perception +3 Pilot +8 Stealth +6 Use Computer +13

"Acknowledged sir." you hear the intercom beep as Rucks turns it off. Though the Aala's Dream is a solid ship she is no Baudo class yacht, you can feel the slight change in course as Captain Rucks follows the ISD Dictators docking instructions.
SQ beeps in acknowledgment of its new orders, though it gives a far longer series of beeps then required for a simple acknowledgment. Something about other duties to preform, engines need attention. The R2 unit complies and rolls over to the terminal plugging into it. After a series of twists and turns the terminal display lights up and a semi transparent image of Ord Barjo appears, with statistics of the planet itself:
Ord Barjo
Region: Mid Rim
Climate: Toxic, jungle
Gravity: Standard
Moons: 2
Length of day: 22 standard hours
length of year: 347 local days
Sapient Species: 60% Human, 40% other
Government: Imperial, local trade council
Capital: Barjon
Major Exports: mineral ore, various gasses
Major Imports: Foodstuffs, Technology
Ord Barjo trade council comprised of three seats occupied by the three largest organizations on Ord Barjo. The trade council oversees the day to day administration of Ord barjo while the empire maintains overall control.
Currently the trade council is comprised of Hoolau chairman of Mudonics a terraforming corporation, Qatya Rossik lead administrator over Sienar interests on Ord Barjo, and Skrisst of the clan Balksst who provide a sizable labor workforce on Ord Barjo.
A slight bump indicates the ships change from space to planet atmosphere, just as Captain Rucks opens the com again. "Master we have entered Ord Barjo`s atmosphere and I have set course for the designated landing coordinates. You may wish to admire the veiw as we continue with our descent."

Xasst finishes reviewing the information that appears on the terminal screen just as Captain Rucks begins to speak over the intercom. "Excellent Captain, I shall join you in the cockpit immediately. SQ you can go back about your business now. Something about the ships engines or somesuch." After dismissing the astromech, the Falleen makes his way up to the cockpit of the Aala's Dream to join the RX-series pilot.

Entering the cockpit you see Captain Rucks seated in the pilots chair, he is still following the provided docking flight path. Taking the seat next to the droid provides you your first view of Ord Barjo.
Outside streams of shipping traffic of various ship transports both enter and exit the planet. All around you the toxic nature of the world itself sets a slightly orange hue to the sky. Below large columns of personal and freight transports flow into and out of the nearest domed city.
In the distance columns of smoke erupt from large circular structures, which dot the area outside the city. Below the ship you see the canopy top of a huge jungle forest which monopolizes much of the landscape. Various flocks of avian birds flutter through the canopy, you cannot help but to wonder about the possibility of numerous hidden beasts under the protective canopy of the Jungle forest.
The flight path takes you to a central access shield on the dome itself. Captain Rucks receives automated entry instructions, which include a numbered entry point. Once through the shield the city opens into view.
Overhead an orange light shines through the transparent dome roof. Inside towering buildings and lines of personal transports dominate the view port. Captain Rucks moves the ship to the lower docks, through the descent between towering skyscrapers the the Aala's Dream lands inside a large open single dock building.

"Excellent Captain, when I get off do me the courtesy of pulling upwhat you can in regards to that resources in the local jungle, there seems to be a lot of it out there and maybe there's something out there we could turn a profit on. I am going to see if our esteemed engineer would mine joining me as I peruse this place for our supplies, what do you give the odds he will want to partake?" Xasst states to the pilot droid as the Ghtroc 720 finally finishes it's landing. Captain Rucks looks at the Falleen before stating, "I believe that R2-SQ will as you humanoids say 'be thrilled by the idea'. May I suggest you fight a gundark barehanded instead, Sir." "I may take you up on that suggestion Rucks." Xasst said with slight chuckle, "also I don't know if this needs to be said anymore but let's be prepared for a quickstart on the engines in case we have to get out of here in a hurry." The RX-Series droid doesn't even glance over at his Falleen master this time as he says, "That would be normal operating procedure since we took over ownership of this vessel, Sir. It shall be done. Don't go getting into too much trouble now, this ship isn't quite as fast or manueverable as the Baudo yacht." Xasst looks back at the droid one more time before leaving the cockpit and says, "Nothing I'm sure your skills can't manage to make up for Captain."
As the Falleen enters the engineering section of the ship he can he the whirls and whistles of the astromech droid at work. "SQ? We just landed and I'm going to take a step off the ship to pick up our supplies and such, care to join me?" The annoyed whistles give the clear indication of how the astromech droid feels about the situation. "I just hope I don't mess anything up and pick up the wrong equipment, you know how little I know about these things." The droid again whistles and whirls in agitation but seems to reluctantly agree to join Xasst. "I'll tell you what I'm going to gather some things from my room and then head out, if you care to join me I will see you at the ramp, if not just send me the list of equipment you want to me to pick up and hopefully I will not mess things up too bad." The Falleen chuckled again as he left the engineering section and heads to his room to gather his belongings.

After gathering a few items for His personal quarters Xasst finds that the netry ramp has already been lowered. Outside the ship voices can be heard, the first unknown:
"I repeat name your cargo, destination and purpose on Ord Barjo." The voice is human, female perhaps mid thirties.
The second voice is that of 2-1B stating matter of factly "As I have stated already are only cargo is my master a single passenger and some droids. Our purpose here is merly to refuel and perhaps a little shopping, and our destination is Coruscant. These answers will not change no matter the number of times you propose your inquiry." Though it is true someday you will set course for Coruscant the droid lies to the imperial customs agent.
At the bottom of the ramp R2-SQ awaits your arrival. A few meters from the ramp 2-1B stands negotiating with a raven haired human imperial customs officer dressed in regulation imperial uniform. To the officers right a white translator driod stands waiting to provide its services to the conversation. The landing bay is sparse a single fuel regulator panel in the middle of the inner platform, around the walls hangs a series of tools mostly for general ship repair. The room has but a single door resting between two large transparent dura steel windows which over look the market street outside.
From here you can see a busy market street, customers and merchants alike crowd the area mixed with the odd pair of white armor clad storm troopers. A few merchant stands can be seen though they are of temporary construction, tents and folding tables mostly.
2-1B does not seem to understand the concept that a simple currency transaction would both smooth over the current negotiation as well as end it. You notice that the imperial officer is armed though with the twin trooper escort she has guarding the door she most likely would never have use of it.

Xasst straightens himself for a moment before proceeding down the ramp. "My apologies for the medical droid's behavior, officer. While his skills in medicine are favorable, his social skills are lacking. 21-B, I believe you have affairs to take care of aboard the ship, please apologize to the lovely...." Xasst's gaze bears onto the customs officer as he uses his Falleen charms to the best of his abilities, "...officer immediately for wasting her valuable time and be about your duties." The medical droid issued his apologies at his master's request and made his way back into the vessel.
After a moment the young Falleen begins to address the customs officer again, reaching for her hand to kiss while also palming 100 credits into the officer's hand that he takes he speaks again, "If I had known that the Empire was positioning all of it's most lovely officers on Ord Barjo I would have ensured my travels brought me here sooner. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Xaast of House Sizhran on a journey to visit my uncle's palace on Coruscant. As the droid mentioned we landed here in order to pick up some basic supplies, although I believe I could be persuaded to linger on this planet to take in it's *lovely sights*." As Xasst says this he issues the pheromones of his people in the direction of the officer. "I hope there is no problems with our docking here, Ms... well I must apologize, in all my distraction by your lovliness I forgot my manners in requesting the name of the beautiful creature I have the pleasure of speaking with."
