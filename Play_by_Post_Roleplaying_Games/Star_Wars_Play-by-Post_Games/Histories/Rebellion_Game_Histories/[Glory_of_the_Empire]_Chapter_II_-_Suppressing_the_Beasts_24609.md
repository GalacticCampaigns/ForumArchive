# [Glory of the Empire] Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-11 13:41:40)

*For reasons yet unknown, the native Barabel of Barab I has risen up against Imperial rule, and overthrown the garrison stationed there. The Imperial grip has never been hard on those lizards, we even saved them from being hunted for sport. But our kindness stretches only so far, and for taking up arms against the supreme rule of the Empire, they must be dealt with…*
A few weeks have passed since your encounter in the Vahaba Belt, and in the time, you have been officially given the rank of Imperial Stormtroopers, as well as participated in a few short exercise drills to confirm this. Now, however, the time has come for you to prove yourself in a full-scale battle against the enemies of the Empire. You have been assembled along with the rest of your platoon in one of the many briefing rooms aboard the Star Destroyer *Fury*, which is currently coursing through hyperspace headed for Barab I.
As Lieutenant Nates enters through the door, one of the lower officers present calls attention on deck as he proceeds through the room to take place in front of you.
"At ease, soldiers. First off, I´d like to congratulate you all on completing he basic stages of your training. Special congratulations to those that have become the subject of promotions. Although the cause for your promotions may have been grim and unwanted, it is still your skill and dedication that have brought just you into consideration for promotions"
There is no doubt of the underlying sadness in his voice as he speaks the last sentence, and the room seems to fill with a silent reverence for the fallen. After a few moments, he steps forward and places a holoprojector on the table in front of him. The projector hums to life, and the image of a bright, red planet appears.
"Our destination is Barab I, a harsh planet on the Outer Rim, and home to the Barabel species. For years, Imperial relations with the natives have been good, and they have caused us little trouble. Recently however, we learned that rebel activities on the planet had increased in numbers, and a few days back, we lost contact with the garrison on the planet. Reports from probes sent to the system suggests that they have been overrun"

Standing off to the side with the rest of the squad, his helmet on the chair next to him, Kirnos leaned against the wall as the LT began the briefing. His slight frown deepened when the LT mentioned that the aliens overran the garrison. *If they are as primitive as we're told*, Kirnos thought as he studied the map, *then they shouldn't have been able to do that. Which means they had helped.*
Kirnos kept the observation to himself for a little bit longer, hoping the LT would go into depth on the situation.

Beksus stood over the projecter with off duty clothed worn loosely over him. "I guess the Tarkin Doctrine doesn't work all of the time then. What are the specifics on our mission?" He asked the Liuetenant as he shifted his weight onto his right foot, seemingly anxious about something. "We getting any support?"

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-12 18:53:01)

Lt Nates turns his head towards Beksus, and you can see that he is perhaps not 100% with soldiers wearing civilian garbs to a briefing. It doesn´t seem to bother him that much though, as a smile enters his face.
"If you mean any support beyond the just above 8,000 other soldiers aboard this ship, then no, we are not getting any support. But I hope you´ll manage"
A damp laughter spreads across the room. Nates continues.
"The nature of the battlefield is ill-suited for both ground vehicles, artillery, or orbital bombardment. Any points of interest is located underground, in the vast tunnel complexes that pierces the entire planet. The only thing even remotely close to the surface is a small opening where the spaceport and city of Alater-ka is located. This is the only permanent settlement known on the planet, so naturally it is a high-value target. Unfortunately, it is protected by a highly powerful force field, used to shield the city from the intense radiation during the plants daylight hours. Any intrusion into the city will have to be made though the underground tunnels"
He presses a button on the projector, and the image zooms out, showing a full view of the Barab system.
"Which brings me to the next point on the agenda. Barab I has an extremely close orbit to its sun, and as such, the planets surface is exposed to enormous amounts of radiation during the daylight hours. Fortunately, those hours are only 6 out of the total 60 in one of the planets days. Just to be on the safe side though, all operations will be performed during the night hours, and you will all be equipped with emergency treatment kits for radiation damage"

Leaning forward, Kirnos cleared his throat before raising his hand. "Sir, what about the locals and the insurgents?" Kirnos asked, before gesturing to the map. "Seems pretty odd that they would turn on us when there wasn't too much to turn on, which suggests they were instigated from the outside. That might explain how they took out a garrison."
Kirnos looked over at the civilian dressed Sergeant, but decided for it wouldn't be a good idea to break protocol just yet when it came to meetings.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-12 19:47:39)

The lieutenant nods and presses yet another button on the projector, and a hologram of a muscular, bipedal reptilian appears.
"Yes, Corporal, Imperial Intelligence have drawn the same conclusion. The Barabel lacks a central government, and are loosely organized in a clan structure. To create a coordinated resistance like this, something out of the ordinary has happened, although Intelligence has yet to uncover what this is"
He clears his throat, and adapts a more serious look.
"This, however, will not interfere with your mission. This kind of rebellion can not be tolerated, nor can the assault on Imperial forces. Our orders are the complete and utter destruction of the resistance, and the restoration of order"

Ethan sat quietly during the briefing so far. He took in what the Lieutenant and his fellow soldiers have been saying. This mission wasn't going to be easy; but easy isn't what stormtroopers do.
Ethan raised his hand and rose to his feet when called on.
"Sir, do we have any intel on the leaders of these clans? Do they have any influence in the city itself? If these clans are the ones putting up the resistance, cutting off the head may ease our problems."
Shifting subjects for a moment.
"Also, what do we know about these underground tunnels?"

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-13 16:27:09)

When Ethan speaks up, Nates shakes his head.
"Being the only permanent settlement on the planet, all clans have some presence and influence in Alater-ka. Intelligence reports however that eliminating the clan leaders would do little to destabilize the clans. If anything, it would further agitate them if we killed of their most respected leaders"
Bringing back the holo of the planets surface, a large mountain range came into the image, with several cave opening flashing by as the camera swept the landscape.
"Our mission begins here. Using these caverns as an entry point into the subterranean tunnels, we will make our way towards a larger underground complex. As far as we know, a smaller mining facility is located here that was used to process and refine the ore gathered from the planets surface. Across the planet, other platoons will make similar incursions on strategic locations as well"
He shut down the holoprojector and picked it up.
"Unless there are any further questions, I want all squads assembled in full gear in the hangar in 15 minutes, prepared to make planetfall"

### **Tempeste** (2010-03-13 16:35:40)

Beksus nodded as the Liuetenant finished speaking and then left the room to don his armour and assemble his allocated equipment. Considering they were to be fighting in underground tunnels, he hoped that it was seen fit as to give them weapons approriate for such combat. He didn't hold out much hope though, the Empire seemed to like the E11 too much not to assign it for all missions. Once he'd prepared for the mission Beksus headed to the appointed Hangar, with only a few minutes to spare.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-14 14:58:35)

Kirnos nodded, calling the room to attention when LT left, then went over to Sergeant Beksus as he went for his room. "Hey sergeant, I'm heading over to the armory to requisition some gear. Anything you believe we should grab?"

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Tempeste** (2010-03-14 17:16:09)

Beksus ran his mind over the briefing they'd just had. "If we're fighting in tunnels then using heavy explosives is out of the picture. We could do with any equipment that could be useful in close quarters though." His mind flashed back to their first mission, and the killzone of the cramped corridor that ripped their squad apart. "If we're fighting a rebellion, then anyone could be a threat.." Despite having little experience of command he had a bad gut feeling that this mission could go bad very quickly, the title of Sergeant still seemed strange to him. "I'll leave it up to you to make the final decision." He nodded at the Corporal and then continued towards the Hangar after readying himself.

Duo had nothing to add to the meeting, as he found it wasn't his place to speak. His job was to shoot, to kill, and to conquer. The exact details of the mission he left to those of rank.
After the meeting, he followed his new sergeant and corporal. He'd served with them at the pirate stronghold, and felt no jealousy over their recent promotion. Instead, he found it more of a relief. He longed for the rush of battle, not the burden of command.
As for preparation, Duo required only his armament, since he only took his armor off for personal hygiene.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-15 08:46:34)

With the meeting over, there was only one thing to do: suit up and get ready to go to work.
Getting into his armor was somewhat of a ritual for Ethan. He put each piece of the white plasteel cocoon on slowly; making sure it was correctly fastened to the black undersuit. Ethan was superstitious, although he'd never admit it. This was the way he'd always prepared for battle and it's served him well so far. Heck, Ethan's head would have been plastered all over the deck of the pirate stronghold if it weren't for this armor.
The ritual ended with Ethan slipping the helmet over his head. He was now ready for battle.
He walked a far distance behind the new Sergeant and Corporal, not because of their rank but because they served together in Theta squad and they lost a few good men. Ethan was the new guy to the team and didn't want to overstep his bounds.
Arriving in the hanger, Ethan formed up near Beksus.
**"Congratulations on the promotion. I'm sure you will lead us to victory down there"**

With all gear acquired and preparations made, you gather up in one of the hangar bays of the ship. You finds your company gathering near one of several IF-120 Landing Crafts located in the hangar, and quite soon, the full company is gathered.
One of the last to arrive on the scene, Lt Nates walks up to the company. Offering a quick military salute, he calls for a status report from the squad leaders.

### **Tempeste** (2010-03-23 09:22:26)

"Squad assembled and ready for combat, Sir" respondes Red after he saluted the liuetenant. He was fully equipped himself and was fully prepared for the inevitable blood bath. He held his newly aqquired flechette launcher as he almost admired it, it was surely going to be useful in the close confines of the tunnels and catacombs they would soon find themselves in.

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-23 18:50:11)

Double checking the sharpshooter rifle, Kirnos nodded as Red gave the LT his report, then checking out the rest of the gear. *Better to be safe than sorry*, he, keeping in mind that this how most ops should go for here, hopefully. Kirnos noticed that they were light one soldier, and turned to the Sergeant. "Hey Sergeant, aren't we suppose to get a new guy?"

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-24 00:52:58)

**"TK-2099, reporting for Theta Squad sir,"** Nikki says as he steps forward, **"Ready to crack big lizard skulls. Which kit am I humping sir?"** He asks as he looks down at all the gear gathered. He already has his standard issue gear, spotless and well maintained.

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-24 03:26:13)

"There you go. Though I rather hope you place a blaster bolt through their skulls. The Barabel are ferocious in hand-to-hand combat"
Counting everyone present, the Lt motions for the landing craft.
"Okay men, go ahead and pack yourselves into the ship. Squad Leaders remain here with me for a moment, to go over the routine once we hit the ground"

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-24 13:23:11)

At the trooper calling sir, Kirnos went straight up, cracked his neck, and turned his whole body to face the trooper, only to look into the trooper's chest plate.
*What the*, Kirnos thought as he looked up as far as he could with helmet on, before taking it off and putting it under his left arm.
"WHAT THE FRAKKING HELL DID YOU JUST CALL ME?" Kirnos yelled. "First off, it's Corporal," he said, pointing to himself with hand, fingers and thumb together presenting blade. "He's Sergeant," Kirnos said as he gestured to Red, before gesturing to the LT. "And that's the Lieutenant. You call him sir, because he is a commissioned officer and will be treated as such. Understood?"
Taking a deep breath, Kirnos brought his hand down to his side. "And second, what frakking planet did you come from? I believe your half human because you're as big as a frakkin' Wookiee. Who was it, your mom?"
Kirnos took a second to look over at the Sergeant and offered a wink, trying to keep a straight face, before breaking out smiling and jutting out his right hand again. "Good to meet, you, recruit. Corporal Alex Kirnos, second in command of Theta Squad. Pleased to see you ready to kick some arse, but tone it down a bit and we'll see to it you come back alive and not in a body bag."
(OOC: Yeah, my guy is only 5' 7", so he's a little short to you.)

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-24 22:02:30)

Nikki takes the proffered hand and shakes it the way his drill sergeant taught him, like he's trying to break it off, and replies, **"Better safe than sorry Corporal. Nikki Breodanir, or Nekk. As for Ma, no telling. Pa wasn't the discriminating type and I never met the lady myself."** The grin in his voice manages to come through the helmet.
He reaches down and takes couple arm loads of kit and hoofs it towards the transport. *"I get the feeling I'm gonna like it here,"* he thinks as he climbs the boarding ramp.

Ethan stood at the position of attention with the squad when the new guy... er... newer guy fell into formation.
*At least I'm not the only new addition to the squad*, he thought to himself.
After the faux dressing down Nekk received, Ethan smiled under his helmet. There were a good group of soldiers.
Being dismissed by the LT, Ethan followed the rest of the squad into the awaiting landing craft.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-27 10:56:26)

With the soldiers loading up inside the ship, and the squad leaders assembled around him, Nates proceeds to give a few final instruction.
"OK, here´s how this will work. I am not aware of how much training you´ve had on planet dropping with IF-120´s, but it is nothing complicated. These ships are built to be able to be used as a command base after landing, and that´s what we´ll do. We will use the ship as a base of operations, and also as a barracks for R&R. During the night hours, we will station two squads outside as sentries, but in the daytime all will have to reside inside the ship, due to the radiation. Most of the planets life avoids the surface during these hours though, so our own sensors should suffice"
He motions for them to get on board the ships.
"I want an assembly with you again once we land. Instruct your squads to suit up for action immediately. I want you out in those caves to gain a brief survey of them before the day comes. Move out"
As the leaders rejoins their squads, the IF-120´s takes off, and heads towards the planes surface.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-29 18:24:55)

The trip down the planet is uneventful, and soon the ship settles down on the planet. The landing site for your company is a small rocky area, shielded on two sides by a large plateau. It might seem like a cornered position to set up camp, but it also offers limited options for opposition to approach.
With the ship settled down, Nates appears to the main hold where you are all gathered.
"Alright men, let´s get to it. Squad Leaders with me, the rest of you, start unloading the gear"

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-29 20:02:16)

Kirnos nodded to Red, indicating he'll get Theta on it, before taking a look around the canyon. *This isn't good. Especially as the enemy probably already know the terrain better than we do.* Silently, Kirnos considered the best actions on how to defend the place.
"Ok, guys, let's get this done," Kirnos said before he was lost in thought for a second.
Knowledge (Tactics) +8

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-03-31 06:17:49)

As he thinks about it, Kirnos immediately realizes that defending the "front" of the base will not be a problem. Any attackers would be limited to approaching from two directions only, making them easier to manage than if they could surround the base.
An assault from the top of the plateau seems unlikely, given the fact that the Barabel are known to have limited access to modern firearms, and would need to expose themselves while rappelling down the cliffside in order to be able to strike. As long as the sentries keeps that side under watch as well, you should not be caught off guard.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Magical2099** (2010-03-31 09:56:09)

Nikki stands, glad to get out of the sitting position which is never comfortable in armor. Hearing his orders he shoulders his rifle and grabs up a container full of supplies.
As he comes down the ramp and gets his first look at Barab 1 he looks to Kirnos, **"Where ya want it, Corporal?"** looking down at the label quickly in case he wanted to know what was in this particular one.

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Tempeste** (2010-03-31 15:40:09)

"Alright men, get this stuff offloaded and report back when you're done," Ordered Red, probably his first real order since being promoted, though he doubted any lives would be put at risk by it. He felt many future decisions would do just that. After obesrving the troopers work for a moment he took a few steps and headed to the Liuetenant.
"Squad's ready for action."

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-04-01 00:21:42)

"Good, because you will be moving out soon enough. I will keep one platoon remaining here for R&R, reinforcements, and base security, but the rest of you I want out in those tunnels soon enough"
Nates places a holoprojector on the ground, and a 3D image of the surrounding landscape appears, showing a very broken terrain with high plateaus and deep canyons. Three spots on the map are marked, appearing to be a few kilometers apart.
"These will be your points of entry into the tunnel system. We have intelligence that suggests the presence of a small encampment in this region, but no specifics. You will have to conduct a manual search of the area. The battlefield will be limited, so I suggest you do not split down to less than two squads at a time. The enemy is skilled at close combat, and has the advantage of knowing the terrain and total visibility in darkness. If attacked, be merciless, but try to obtain what information can be gained by interrogating prisoners if you get the chance"
He assumes a typical "Questions?" posture and looks at the squad leaders.

Kirnos took a second to look at the map, then raised his hand. "Sir, how far are these caves from here? Also, how are we getting into and out of there, especially if we need an immediate extraction?" While Kirnos may not want to admit it, these were important aspects since they are doing a recon by force in the area.

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-04-06 14:13:50)

"They are a few klicks away from our current location. You will perform this operation on foot, as the terrain makes the usage of vehicles - even repulsorlift ones - too limited that you are better off without them"
"We will have a single platoon standing at ready in case you need backup. You´ve all been issued long-range comlinks that should have little difficulty reaching us no matter how deep underground you goes, unless you decides to take some weird trip towards the planets core.
He turns and casts a quick glance at the group of commanders to his left.
"At what rate do you estimate your men can appear on-stage if needed Sergeant?"
One of the soldiers, apparently in command of the squads meant to remain at base, straightens up into attention.
"With the distances given, a minimum of 5 minutes will be required for us to reach a squad in need"
Nates looks back to the rest of you.
"There you have it. Don´t think too long about calling for aid if you need it or you might not be around to get it. More questions?"

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-04-08 18:07:35)

When an answer fails to come from Kirnos, Nikki hears a voice from behind instead.
"Just put it down somewhere and haul out another one. It sounded like we´re gonna be off soon, so someone else´ll arrange it"
It was quite difficult to determine who was who through the white armor and mechanical helmet mike, but Nikki was pretty certain that it was Chaz. Apparently Chaz had joined the team only a few weeks before, so he could probably still be considered a "new" member of the squad. Putting down a massive crate of supplies himself, the other looked back at Nikki.
"This your first field mission?"

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-04-08 18:11:50)

Inside the ship, as he was hauling up a crate of medical supplies, Duo felt another pair of hands grab hold off the crate and halt him.
"Let me just grab a couple of things from this. The syringe in my pack was broken, and there has to be a spare in here somewhere"
Duo recognized the other immediately as Murc, the veteran clone medic who had been assigned to Theta squad shortly after their mission in the asteroid belt. Unlike himself, Murc had participated in the Clone Wars, and was one of the dwindling number of veteran clones who still served in the Imperial military.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-04-08 18:16:43)

While he helped to unload the supplies from the ship, Adrian noticed one of the troopers who seemed to be a little more eager to work than the others, one who moves just a bit faster than the rest of them, and who seemed to take just a little more pride in following his orders as efficiently as possible.
While he couldn´t be certain, Adrian was pretty certain that the eager trooper was Cam. Cam had been assigned to Theta squad barely a week ago, and he had already made it clear that being the perfect soldier was his goal. Not by spoken words but by actions, always following protocol as exactly as possible. Even his spare time he spent mostly on studying battle tactics manuals or maintaining his gear.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Magical2099** (2010-04-08 23:39:49)

At Chaz's question Nikki puts the crate down and turns to follow him back in, **"Yeah. You?"**
He doesn't wait for the reply, assuming they would talk while working. He takes up another crate and continues with his orders.

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Tempeste** (2010-04-09 10:23:53)

"Just give the order and we'll move out," responsed Red before turning away from the Lt and observing his squad. The time was fast approaching that the new members of the squad would be tested in battle. He hoped they were up to it.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Anonymous** (2010-04-11 21:14:41)

Kirnos nodded as he thought about what the LT had said. *Too much is going on with having us move by foot,* he thought. *If it turns out the locals are getting help, this could turn really bad.*
As Red said to give the order when the Lt was ready, Kirnos nodded, then went over to the rest of the squad, finding them already stacking some crates. "Ok, men, get ready for a patrol. This gear can be unloaded by someone else while we're out." Kirnos looked over to the Sergeant for a second, then made his way over to the Murc. "You have everything you'll need, Doc?"

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-04-12 18:00:21)

"Nah, I´ve been taking a couple turns through garrison duty on the Rim. Just like here, those blasted aliens don´t know their place"
Spotting something over Nikki´s shoulder, Chaz pats the crate the other is carrying and starts away.
"Put that thing down, it looks like we´ve got work to do"
=======================================================
Murc nods in the typical simple fashion still engraved in those who´ve served in the highly disciplined clone army.
"Yes sir, and hopefully this´ll just be another drill of carrying around junk I don´t have to use"
=======================================================
As the squad starts to assemble behind them, the lieutenant hands a datapad over to Red.
"Very well, here are your orders. This pad contains the exact coordinates for your point of entry, as well as a recap of objectives and whatever scarce intel we have on the area. Coordinate with the other leaders in your platoon if you will, but I expect you and your squad to be advancing on the target in 15 minutes. Move out"

Kirnos shook his head as the clone veteran called him sir. "Sorry, Murc, but it's corporal. LT's the sir. Hell, I should be calling you sir." Quietly, Kirnos double checked the sharpshooter and the rest of his equipment. "But beyond that, I hope you're right."

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

As he finished stuffing some things down his backpack, Murc looked up at Kirnos.
"Yes sir"

### **Parmenter** (2010-04-15 09:01:44)

Duo felt like a child who'd just met their favorite holovid star. He was at a loss for words and all he could do was stare uncomfortably at the other clone trooper. He continued to hold the box while their new medic acquired the things that he needed, and when he was finished Duo quickly went back to unloading the shuttle into the base camp.
Duo catches small bits of conversation, but remains working in silence until he hears the words 'Move out.' Those two simple words snap him into attention then into a steady trot to acquire his gear, then form up with his squad. Joining the others he nods his readiness.

---

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Tempeste** (2010-04-15 18:36:23)

Red called for the squad to assemble, leaving their manual work for the others who'd remain at the landing area.
"I need you all ready to move out in the next five minutes, We're going to approach these co-ordinates and enter the cave system. Be aware of the surroundings and watch for ambushes. I've never met a Barabel before but I've been told they can be deadly at close quarters. Luckily for us they don't have experience and training." Beneath his helmet Beksus was slightly more nervous than he let on ,"Any questions?"

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **Magical2099** (2010-04-15 19:20:05)

Nikki sets the crate down and follows Chaz towards the Sergeant, unlimbering his rifle and checking its charge. He replies to the query on queries, **"No sir. Ready to move, sir."**

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-04-17 10:47:49)

With no further questions presented from the squad, Theta squad finds themselves on the move in a matter of minutes. The terrain you walk through is barren and mostly lifeless, and the ground is cracked in many places. The occasional mesa or sheltering hill passes by as you travel towards your destination, creating interesting silhouettes in the nighttime illumination. As you draw closer, the terrain changes, and you find yourselves walking around low mountain ranges, until you finally reach your point of entry into the tunnel complex that runs beneath Barab I´s surface.
It is a cave opening, approximately 7 meters high and just as wide. Given the lack of light, it is hard to see very far into the cave, but you can see it littered with somewhat larger pieces of rubble than you´ve seen before, but otherwise it appears to be pretty similar to the terrain you have just traveled through. Beyond that, you can´t see very much.
Chaz puts down his rifle and leans towards a nearby rock.

Kirnos nodded when Chaz made his comment, though he realizes he never has been to Tatooine and doesn't want to go there if possible. *Damn, should have goten some better armour than this*, Kirnos thought as he felt some sweat dripping down his back. *Maybe after this mission.*
As Kirnos mulled on his thought for a second, he did a scan of the area, seeing if there was anything out of the ordinary.

As Kirnos looked around, he saw the mountain terain they had just walked through stretching out in all directions, bathed in the typical look of a low-light vision visor. He saw little movement, except for a small creature of some kind scurrying across a nearby trail. It seemed that this particular area was low on activity, even during the night hours.
Relaxing the shoulder straps on his backpack with his hands, Murc looked up towards the sky.
"It´s the sun, the bloody thing is close enough to the surface to generate the heat of three suns. Even the night isn´t enough to damp it to normal levels"

**"I can recon a bit if ya want Sarge. Picked up a bit about being quiet back on Socorro avoiding, uh… well… us.

It helped with the heat and only made his helmet smell much worse, but his nose died fairly quickly so he was okay with the stink.

Kirnos looked around, still no seeing anything moving besides them. *Doesn't mean we ain't getting watched.* Kirnos thought for a second that they should go back for some better gear for searching the tunnels, but decided against it. *We're out here already and the other squads will probably need it.*
Nek mentioned a recon of the area, it made sense to him. "Good thinking, Nekk Hound," Kirnos said as he did one more passive search. "You know MSL?"

Kirnos mulled the thought for a second. "I wish I could say I'd doubt it, but they also took out an Imperial Garrison. The only thing we can hope for is that our late buddies slagged the commo equipment before they were overran." Kirnos didn't even bother to consider the ramifications of that. "Either way, we'll find out soon enough." Kirnos looked over at the others, nodding to Chaz. "Hey Chaz, you up for some recon work?"

Nikki nods and begins to creep forward, wishing already for some kind of night-vision upgrade to his armor. He watches the ground almost as intently as the area ahead of him careful of making any sound. The white armor wouldn't matter down here, black as it was, but any sound wound be like a signal flare. He makes his steps over exaggerated, stepping wide of large rocks, trying to give his squad a clear path and some hint as to how to move quietly. He lifts his rifle, leaving the stock folded due to the cramped quarters, and moves forward listening with all his being.

The squad progresses slowly into the dark tunnel complex. Fully on edge, they moves down through the darkness, vigilant and with weapons ready. The vision-enhancing gear in their helmets provides some assistance in navigating in the darkness, but their vision is still rather poor, and they have to proceed with small steps.
After about half an hour or so of creeping forward in the darkness, Nekk notices that the path before them seems to be widening, likely an indication of some sort of larger cavity ahead.

Beksus edged forwards with the flechette launcher still in hand, "Form a line, 2 metre spread. Wouldn't want to miss anything now." The sergeant moved to the centre of the squad before continuing to move forward. One foot in front of the other, trying to be as quiet as possible.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-05-01 13:04:28)

Moving forward, you enters into a larger cavity of far larger dimensions than the tunnels you´ve been walking through before. High up in the ceiling you can even see a few holes to the outside, providing some illumination. With it still being night outside however, the illumination is faint indeed, but you can make out the general silhouettes and shapes of what is inside the cavern.
At the opposite end of the cave - which measures maybe 40 meters across - you can see two tunnel openings. The cave itself is quite open, with a relatively even flooring, and a few boulders here and there, complemented by some stalactites coming down from the roof. What is the most interesting though is what lies in the middle of the cave.
It appears to be some kind of technological equipment, though in the poor lighting, you would have to get closer to examine it. Also, on occasion as you look around the cave, you see faded white objects reflecting the dim light every here and there.

Keeping his pistol up as the squad moved, Kirnos kept his head on a swivel, checking every nook and cranny as the moved, slightly relieved that they have a little bit more light in the cavern.
That relief faded slightly, though, when he noticed the equipment lying around, with bits of white objects lying around. *This isn't good*, Kirnos thought as he stopped, holding a fist up, looking to see if any one else was watching. "Hold," Kirnos whispered over the comm, careful not to say it too loud. "Weapons up."
Catching Red's attention, Kirnos made his way over as silently as possible. "Hey Sergeant, got something," Kirnos whispered, tilting his head in the direction of some of the equipment. "Want me to check it out?"

As commanded, Chaz raised his weapon, but lowered it after a moment, and took a quiet step forward and leaned slightly forward. After a few moments, his voice was heard over the comm.
"Hey guys, I´ve got a riddle for you. What´s white, plastic, and not supposed to be lying around on a cave floor?"

Nikki hears Kirnos and Chaz, sees the white on the floor, and feels that cold dead thing in his stomach start to squirm, **"I've got the left tunnel,"** he says as he moves quietly to the tunnel and takes a knee, extends the stock on his rifle, and assumes a comfortable position for roasting lizards.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-05-12 15:51:42)

The squad moves into the cave, weapons pointed at the two tunnels on the other side. Chaz moves straight into the cave, and kneels by the white pieces on the floor. He looks up for a moment and looks around, and then waves towards Murc.
The clone veteran moves over and kneels next to Chaz and after a moment or two he calls over the comlink.
"Sarge, I think we´d better call for reinforcements. These are *stormtroopers*, and from what I can tell, they´ve not been dead for too long. 24 hours, tops"
Looking around the cave, you see to many white spots glimmering dimly in the poor lighting to be at all comfortable.

"Do we stick together, or shall we split up?"

"We stick together of course," Red would have pressed his palm against his head if he weren't wearing a helmet, "If we split up then we'd leave ourselves vulnerable. Let's keep moving, the longer we stay still the better chance they have of getting the drop on us."

Kirnos looked over at Red when gav the order to move out. "Hey Sergeant, wait one," Kirnos said, trying to be respectful but firm. "LT said nothing about a patrol going missing or any signals from survivors. Seems odd to find a group this close." Kirnos hoped Red drawn the same conclusion as well. *LT said there wasn't any signals from survivors in the last 24 hours. This group either was trying to hide here or they knew where we were going to set up.*
Kirnos turned toward Murc and Chaz. "Doc, how many bodies are here? Chaz, check the body, see if anything might have been taken from him?"
Casually, Kirnos moved closer to the piece of equipment on the ground, his curiosity taking the better of him, though not enough for him to be totally careless. Taking a good look to see if there was any booby traps, Kirnos bent down to pick up the equipment to get a better look at it.

As Kirnos takes a closer look at the equipment on the ground, he realizes that it is a Long-Range Comlink, military style. Upon closer examination, he also notices a Sensor pack lying next to it. Both have been quite badly bruised, and is not likely to work anytime soon.
Taking a quick look around, Murc reports back.
"I count seven bodies, sir. Judging from the pattern of the bodies, I´d say they were trying to mount an organized defense, but were overrun"
Chaz stands up and moves over to two of the bodies close to the one he already examined.
"His weapons were missing, and one of these guys is unarmed as well. Otherwise they appear to have everything you´d expect them to"

Kirnos took stock of the situation, looking over at Red and hoping he wasn't annoying him too much, back at the others. "Ok, in that case, check the weapons and equipment. Maybe we can salvage some gear that our buddies are no longer going to need." *Hope what ever dieties won't take too much offense to this.*
Looking back at Red, Kirno motioned to the LR Comm and the sensor pack. "Hey Sergeant, we have a LR Comm and a sensor pack. Do you want me to check how much damage is done to it?"

"Listen squad. We can stay here picking through their remains, or we can keep moving and kill the alien scum that did this. Which would you rather do?"

Nikki stands from his crouch, it seems to help when the cold dead thing in his stomach begins acting up. As the Sergeant makes his way over he asks, "Which tunnel Sir?" ever thankful the com in his helmet wasn't high quality enough to pick up the slight shake in his voice. Nikki hasn't been comfortable in dark, enclosed places since Socorro and his time in the pits and prisons there, where he first became acquainted with the cold dead thing in his guts that let him know when to move, when to run.

Kirnos looked over at Red when he asked the rhetorical question, seeing the Sergeant head for one of the exits. "Sergeant, shouldn't we send up a report to the LT before we head on into the tunnels," Kirnos asked. *As much as I would love to finish this mission and get out of here, I want to make sure our backs are covered,* thought Kirnos as he did a look around the cavern, paying more attention to the different foot prints as well as where they went. *Besides, if something happens to us, LT will know that there's something down here.*

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-05-24 09:50:04)

As Red reached up to Cam, who was still standing near the edge of one of the tunnels, the soldier gave a small nod to his sergeant as he approached.
**"Yes sir. They need to be put in their place"**
As he looks around the floor, Kirnos sadly enough cannot find a single Barabel body, further suggesting that the squad had been ambushed, or caught in a pinch. Finding any kind of trail on the hard rock floor is difficult even at optimal circumstances, but watching the otherwise poorly illuminated cave through the visor of his helmet makes it close to impossible, and he is unable to find any trail of the attackers anywhere. In fact, they have yet to see a single Barabel up close since they landed on Barab I.
Chaz and Murc stands up from the dead body, apparently getting ready to move out.
**"Well, corporal, they have some ammo and stuff, and a few of them still have their weapons left, though they appear to be malfunctioning"**
Turning over to Red, Murc voices his concern.
**"I agree with the corporal, sir. Command obviously didn´t know about this patrol being here, or we would have been informed about them. We should at least give them a call"**

Suddenly, Cam drops into a crouching stance, and brings his rifle up in a ready position.
**"Sir, I hear something down the tunnel"**
Hearing this, Chaz moves towards Cam, and the determination simply radiates from him as he brings the repeating blaster to bear.
**"Well, I have a surprise for them, bloody lizards"**

Kirnos turned to Cam when he called out movement, waiting for Red to make his decision long past. "Chaz, Nekk, by the enterance. Doc, stand back alittle. Don't want you to go down just yet." Kirnos noted a slit knot in his gut, but living on his adopted home taught him how to fight to survive and for what you made, something that some soldiers never had to worry about or had a chance to enjoy.
Looking back at Red, Kirnos tilted his way back the way they came. "Hate to say it, but now we better let the LT know what's going on."

"I don't want to risk that right now, they could intercept our transmissions and use it to find our location.." Red gave himself a few moments to devise a tactical plan for what could be about to happen. "I want you to split up and wait on each side of the entrance. If anyone comes through we'll catch them in a crossfire," Beksus thought for a moment again, realising a potential flaw in the idea, "Make sure you're at an angle.. I don't want you hitting each other in the excitement." With the orders given out he took a prone position amongst the fallen stormtroopers, ready to ambush any unsuspecting Lizards.

Nekk dropped back into the crouch he had just left, remaining where he had been watching the left tunnel since they had entered the room. He lets his training take over and extends the stock on his rifle, throws the switch to enable autofire, brings it up to his shoulder, and trains it on the tunnel mouth Cam indicated.

Suddenly a sound was heard down the tunnel to the left. The sound of footsteps, armored footsteps. The tension is released though, when a figure dressed in a worn stormtrooper armor, staggers into the cave. This stormtrooper has his blaster rifle ready, though it is lowered slightly when he notices the appearance of the others.

At the sight of a more friendly face coming out the tunnel, both Cam and Chaz lowers their weapons. Adrian, currently watching the other tunnel also relaxes for a moment. Unfortunately, it was the wrong moment. A single blaster bolt lances out of the tunnel, catching the stomtrooper hard in the side, causing him to topple over in pain.
From inside the tunnel, a loud noise can be heard, and a pack of savage-looking Barabel jumps out of the tunnel, shouting ferocious warcries.

Unfortunately, the shot that took out Adrian took him by surprised. By instinct, Kirnos turned around, blaster raised as the barabels let out a warcry. *Not the smartest thing to do*, Kirnos thought as he moved to get a better position before returning fire.

"Ambush! Get into cover!" he then yells, as he rushes up near the stalagmites near one of the unknown troopers (Duo), to get into some cover, anything to give an advantage.

Cam smacks the shoulder plate of Chaz´s armor and keeps his rifle trained down the empty tunnel. Stepping out into the cave, Chaz raises his repeater and releases a burst towards the Barabel. His aim seems off though, and the shots spray the wall around the entrance with red bolts.
Duo on the other hand is perfectly positioned, and his spray of red bolts cuts into two of the attackers, causing cries of pain, as well as bits of reptilian flesh flying.

The concentrated hailfire of the stormtroopers proves too much for the Barabel, and apparently they were not expecting such a heavy and swift response. Turning flat, they scurry down the same tunnel they came from, but they leave behind two corpses, smoking holes covering vast parts of their bodies.
With the most immediate threat relaxed, Murc rushes over towards Adrian, kneeling at his fallen comrade, ripping the helmet off of him to check for pulse.

I'd say standing in a pool of bodies in a damned cave counts as a stressful situation,* he moves around to put himself between the medics and the tunnel mouth.
**"Orders, sir? Should we pursue?** he asks, giving the corpses a quick visual once-over with his rifle at the ready.

Murc doesn´t say anything as Gavin approaches, and rapidly assists the newcomer in patching Adrian up. The clone veteran doesn´t sound happy though.
**"He is probably stable for now, but if the shot pierced too deep, he´ll risk an internal bleeding any moment. If so, he´s in bad shape, and there´s pretty much nothing we can do about it in here"**
The soldier stands up and moves over to Red, and the annoyance in his voice is not even slightly masked.
**"SIR! This may be your first time in command of a unit, but I´ve seen local militiamen that had more commanding skills in them. Get it together"**
Without hesitation, he grabs the communicator unit from the backpack-sized comlink Red is carrying and presses the button.
**"Command, this is TC-8010 requesting immediate medical assistance. We have a man down that most likely requires immediate surgery or this squad will be a man shorter. We´ve also encountered a squad of friendlies that saw the worse part of those Barabel´s claws. One survivor confirmed, and seven stiffs located. Over"**

"Stand down trooper. You may think you have experience but I'm the ranking NCO here, not you," Red's anger was barely contained. Not only had his men ignored his orders but now he was being called out for it. Red snatched back the communicator and opened the channel again, "This is Sergeant Taylo, TK-1886 requesting assistance. We have a casualty in need of evac and a soldier who I refuse to have under my command. Over." Red's eyes narrowed under his healmet, glaring at the aging clone trooper.

The clone stormtrooper keeps his eyes fixed on Red for a while, then his helmet can be seen moving in a small nod before he hands the communications device over.
**"Very well sir. Just remember that you are in charge here, and a commander cannot freeze when his men need him. I´ll prepare the wounded for transport"**
Moving back to where Adrian has fallen, Murc begins to unload the stretcher from his backpack, and pats Gavin on the shoulder.
**"Looks like you are the resident medic now kid. Keep 'em intact, will ya?"**
There is a brief moment of silence over the comm, before it sounds again.
**"TK-1886, this is Lt Nates speaking. Prepare the wounded for evacuation, and have someone be ready to accompany him back to base for debriefing on your progress so far. We will send men to replace them in your squad. Have your men make their way back to your insertion point and secure the area until reinforcements arrives. Once they arrive, proceed with your assignment"**
There is some more silence, but Nates´s voice comes back, lower this time, as if only meant for Red to hear.
**"And sergeant…it is your job to keep the squad working. Remember, morale can make or break a squad. Command out"**

"Received and Understood Liuetenant," Red returned to communicator to it's place and turned to face the rest of the squad. "We're going to fall back to the insertion point and secure the area for reinforcements. Duo, you're up for taking back the wounded and debriefing the liuetenant when you get there. Move out." Red sighed and began to lead the way back to the insertion point.

After being certain that moving the injured trooper wouldn't do him unneeded harm, Gavin looks at Murc, the frown beneath his helmet not visible. He swiftly aids the other medic in moving the injured trooper to the stretcher.
"I'll take care of them, trooper Duo," he says to the medic, guessing his name out from the orders given by the sergeant. Then he stands up to give the sergeant a salute.
"TK-9668, Trooper Gavin Tethia, reporting for duty, sir. I shall not fail this team, I promise." The last is said with sadness in his voice.

Kirnos was silent as he kept an eye out for what was going on, keepig the sniper rifle slinged as he holstered his pistol and picked up Adrian's rifle. *This is begining to go like our last mission,* was all he thought as Murc laid into Redfor not showing much initiative. *Kind of hard to, when our first squad leader and team leader were killed in our first engagement.*
When Nikki voiced his concern, Kirnos nodded. "Hate to say, but you're right." Looking to Red, Kirnos nodded to the destroyed scanner and longrange comms. "Sergeant, we better take the weapons and gear with us. That way the enemy won't be able to get thier hands on the information, if there's any inside." While it looked pretty banged up, Kirnos also know that it doesn't take much for a skilled mechanic to fix this equipment, given enough time and parts.
Looking to the larger trooper, Kirnos nodded at the scanner. "Nekk, grab the scanner. Chaz, grab the long range comms." Kirnos looked at Murc. "Will that stretcher be able to carry a few rifles in addition to Adrian?"

"I agree, carry whatever you can. We should probably sabotage the rest to ensure they can't use it. Maybe even trap it to teach them a lesson," Red looked at the new trooper, "Welcome to the Squad Trooper, a shame it's under such circumstances. Their sacrifice won't be in vain though." Beksus then looked down at the bodies of the stormtroopers, it seemed like a good idea to booby-trap anything the enemy could use but was desicrating the fallen really worth it? He wanted the beasts dead but he still had humanity.

**"Sure thing Corporal,"** Nikki says as he heads to the equipment on the ground, **"There's still room to spare in my pack and bandoleer, if we need it for medpacs, powerpacks, or 'nades."**
Nikki crouches down next to the gear, looking to see if it still has its shoulder harness or if he would have to sling his rifle and carry it.

**"Name´s Murc"**
The aged clone veteran gives Gavin a pat on the shoulder as he gets up, then calls for Duo to aid him with the stretcher. At Kirnos´s request, he shakes his head.
**"Preferably not, corporal. He´s a heavy guy, so I wouldn´t push it. If you could take them by hand, I´d appreciate it"**
In a swift fashion Theta squad field strips the corpses of their fallen kin, taking what few supplies can be found. Duo and Murc carries the stretcher with Adrian on, and Nikki and Chaz brings the broken gear.
The squad makes it back to their insertion point without trouble, and as they near the tunnel entrance they can see the night hours have not passed yet. Any allies or reinforcements are nowhere to be seen, so they settle down in defensive positions and wait.

You can call me Nikki, or Nekk, or Wookie's boy as the Corporal suggested when I met him,"** he says to the trooper, joking about his size.
**"There's Chaz with the light repeater, Corporal Kirnos has the scoped rifle, Cam is over there. You've met Murc and Duo, and what's left of Adrian.

"Nice meeting you Murc, though it would have been better in another place at another time." the 'other medic' comments with a smile. After hearing the question directed at him, the trooper replies to Nikki.
"Some call me Gav, a few call me T. Gavin is also fine. So, Wookie Boy, is it? Nahh, I don't think so, I mean arguably you're not as hairy as they are, though I guess there may be Wookie genes in you." With that said the young trooper lets out a small laugh.

Some of the arrived soldiers moves to relieve the ones carrying the stretcher. With little delay and farewells, Murc and Duo leaves with them, bringing back as much gear as possible. You figure you´ll see them later anyway.
Along with Mal, two troopers remain behind. They appear to be carrying no gear out of the ordinary, and with the same ghostly appearance as everyone else, it is impossible to tell from the looks of them if they possess any skills beyond the usual.
With reinforcements arrived, and the wounded transported away, you feel it is time to get back to work.

It is some relief that Tethia greets Theta squad, though he doesn't show it much, simply giving a nod to acknowledge their arrival. However before Theta squad takes off, the 'new medic' of the team is quickly asking around for a few spare medkits, since he only possessed the one that was part of his standard equipment. Then upon hearing Nikki's question, the medic turns his attention to his new squadmember.
"I've only got a single one. And this might get ugly really fast, in the bad way. So another few kits would definitely make me feel a lot more confident that I could handle my new temporary duties." the trooper says to his fellow squadmember, as he quickly checks his medkit, then his rifle, before casting a glance back in the direction where they had the encounter.

The two stormtroopers that had arrived at the same time as Mal looks at each others and nods. One of them takes a step forward.
**"TK-9601 reinforcing squad as ordered, sir. I have been briefed on the mission so far, but I also happen to know we are about to receive and update on the situation"**
As on cue, the other stormtrooper steps forward as well. Picking up a holoprojector from his belt, he places it on the ground and as it activates it shows a map of your immediate surrounding. A flashing dot apparently marks your position on the map.
**"Situation has changed a bit since you were dispatched on your mission. Not unlike your own experience, many other squads has encountered smaller pockets of resistance. Some has also come across other ambushed sentry posts like the one you were stationed at, TK-2193"**
The image of the map zooms out a bit, and another flashing dot appears and this one covers a small area a few clicks away.
**"We have received reports from units operating in this sector that the resistance movement appears to be massing its numbers. Our forces have driven them into underground tunnels leading them in your direction"**
Another dot appears on the map, flashing somewhere in between the marked area and your current location.
**"You are to advance to this location, and cover the tunnel openings there. Ambush any soldiers that tries to emerge and put them down. With our forces massing on them from the other side, and other squads taking similar positions near other possible exits, we will have them boxed in"**
The soldier turned away and looked towards the sky.
**"The night should last for a few more hours, but we are coming up on the daylight and this means the surface of this planet will become heavily radiated. Given that they have developed a natural resistance to the radiation of Barab I´s sun, intelligence deems it highly possible that they might try to reach the surface anyway, especially if pressed. However, should daylight arrive, I would suggest you advance your position inside the tunnels, unless you want a really nice sunburn"**
Picking up the projector, the trooper gave a small salute to you.
**"I would suggest you get moving at once, because they are on their way. I´ll be heading back to command now. Good hunting"**
With those words he takes off back towards your base camp.

Led by Beksus, Theta squad moves out for their new objective. The new arrival, TK-9601, looks a bit skeptic as you heads back into the caves, but falls into line, taking up the rear.
As you proceeds through the dark tunnels of Barab I, it soon stands clear to everyone that choosing to take the route through the tunnels rather than the more straight route across the planet´s surface was a terrible idea. In pitch-black darkness, with nothing to direct you other than the relative location of your destinaton, marching proceeds slow and you cannot even be really sure of where you are going.
After walking in the darkness for about 20-25 minutes, you still haven´t gotten remarkably closer to your destination, though you all begin to feel weariness creep up on you.

Nikki continues to creep forward on point, being as quiet as he can. A while back the rigid way he held his rifle had worn on him, so he had changed to carrying it in his right hand, barrel down, while keeping his left hand on the wall to guide him. He made sure not to get to far ahead of the squad, and had been straining for so long to listen beyond the scrape of his brother's boots he had given himself a headache.
*Request recon training as soon as we hit base, get new helmet, see if I can find a way to make this damned rifle lighter, get roaring drunk, kill the guy that authorized these helmets (bet he never crawled around in a cave during testing),* he thought to himself, listing the things he wanted to do after leaving Barab 1.

Your helmets might seem like they are not working, but matter of fact is that you have been assigned top notch, light-enhancing gear. The reason for your current predicament is simply that there is not even adequate light for this gear to amplify. Back in the cavern, you had some light coming in through small holes in the ceiling, but right now you seems to have passed fuerther underground, since everything around you appears to be solid rock.
You can see just a short distance ahead, barely enough to see your hands if you stretch them out. Neither Mal nor Nikki hear or see anything.

Continuing in the darkness, Theta squad makes their best to try and orient themselves, but the cause seems lost. A small moan can be heard from Chaz as he is apparently getting quite tired of carrying around the large repeater. Suddenly the comlink on Beksus´s back start to beep, and as he opens the channel, a noticeably upset voice can be heard over the line.

Indeed, you will have to pick up the pace to be able to get to your objective in time. In fact, so much that you will have to run. Stepping into a quick march, you moves as fast as can possibly be done inside the dark tunnels, tripping over more than a few times. But haste is pressing, so its just to get up and keep moving again.
After what appears to be an eternity of running, you can finally see some distant light, and your data shows that you are where you are supposed to be. Unfortunately though, that light also means that day has broken on Barab I, meaning that you would do best to complete your objective inside the tunnels. Unless, of course, you want to give your pale armor some tanning.
All glad to catch you breath, you makes halt a bit short of the entrance. It appears that the tunnel you have been traveling in continues onward as well as leading up towards the entrance, and any visitors you might receive will most likely come from that tunnel.
Putting down his repeater for a moment, Chaz leans towards the tunnel wall, as does both Cam and Kirnos. Beksus, however, bearly topples over as you stop, clearly near the brink of exhaustion.

He just had to keep these lizards from making a soup bowl out of his skull.

The medic has been quiet for a long time, only curses can be heard muttered once in a while, but he's not been trying to waste his breath on small-talking with the rest of the squad. Instead he's simply been making sure that his rifle was fully loaded, his armor was tightened up and his supplies in order.
As Tethia receives the order, he looks over at Nikki and gives a small nod. For now he's obeying those orders, unless a superior gives other orders. He attempts to place himself in a situation where he has as much of a view as possible, while also providing some cover, while staying near the sarge and hopefully close to most other troopers.

It appears that Nikki´s orders are well received, people being glad someone is actually taking charge. Unfolding the stock on his rifle, Nikki moves through the darkness towards the adjoining tunnel to set up for an ambush. With the very small amount of light siphoning in from the distant entrance, he manages to navigate himself to where he is supposed to be, and people around him seems to scramble to do the same. Suddenly a distant roar is heard, and whatever light Theta squad had vanishes. Turning his head to check, Nikki notices that the sky outside the entrance seems to darken, and realizes that the sound must be that of approaching thunder.
Suddenly a series of red energy lances breaks through the darkness, striking into the cave wall near where Mal and Kirnos are standing. On pure instinct, Nikki swings his head back towards the tunnel and the next moment he sees a blurry form right in front of him. Before he can react, something slams into his side with great force and knocks him up towards the cave wall. His vision crippled by the disappearance of the light, he can still make out the form of a Barabel just inside his narrow field of vision.
Complete turmoil erupts in the small passageway as the Barabel charges. Judging by the guttural cries, there is a **lot** of them. Chaz´s voice can be heard over the noise, and the normally humorous voice now spits out a loud stream of curses. Just beside him, Nikki can hear Cam wrestle with one of the attackers. Another red bolt lances through the air, illuminating the combattants before striking into Beksus´s shoulder, nearly toppling the overloaded sergeant over.
Gavin gets a quick glimpse of a Barabel heading for him in the brief flash from the rifle and narrowly manages to turn away the attack, though he can hear the scraping of claws on his armor. Mal, hears Kirnos moan in exertion next to him, apparently tangled up with an attacker.

Just so you don´t think I´m just being mean, it was my intention to have it be dark, but since I might have given the impression you could see things, I figured this was the simplest thing to do.

Mal had just set his rifle down to grab a large rock to start working on his fighting position when the swarm came.
Over the squads commlink
"Who's frakkin idea was it to go into underground tunnels with out proper kit? Come on no thermo-imaging, no infra red light for the low light vision really? Really? At least we have glow rods. Oh Frak! Here they come!"
Mal's momma didn't raise no fools. Mal had assumed they were maintaining light discipline till now, so as not to give away thier position. Since it was now apparent that it didn't karkin matter anymore Mal grabs the glow rod from his belt with his left hand and service pistol with his right. He brings them up and crosses his wrist so the glow rod will point along side the pistol barrel. He clicks the glow rod on and lights up a target for the squad to target.

The force of the blow left Nikki's head ringing, further disorienting him. As he looks at the massive shadow form in front of him his training comes back to mind. Not his Stormtrooper training, but his street fighters training.
*Big. Big and top heavy. With out their legs they're useless. Break the leg, the big man may as well be dead, cause he'll probably be crippled for life. Let's see if that rule applies to lizards,* he thinks as he lets go of his rifle. He steps inside the Barabel's reach and throws an elbow into its jaw, exploding upward with his whole body behind the blow. As gravity brings his weight back down, his leg lashes out at the Barabel's load bearing knee, catching it from the side and trying to break it at its weakest point...

Spurred on by the fact that the element of surprise had worked well in their favor, the Barabel lets out vicious howls in the darkness. A searing red bolt comes flying again, and for a brief second you can see Beksus´s face lit up as the shot slams hard into his chest just below the neck. Then all goes dark again, but you can all hear the sound of something slumping heavily to the ground.
**"Boss!"**
Cam´s cry can be heard through the darkness, and Nikki hears a scream of effort as the soldier next to him wrestles his rifle free and the brief flash that shows up is accompanied by the smell of burnt flesh and a pained scream as the soldier disengages his attacker. Suddenly a beam of light illuminates the tunnel as Mal gets his Glow Rod up and turns it towards the origin of the laser blasts. A few steps down the tunnel the cone centers on a large Barabel holding a blaster rifle, and in the middle of them beam two Barabel are struggling with someone on the ground. Further down the tunnel, you can make out the shape of another Barabel just at the edge of the light from the glow rod. Otherwise, you did manage to get into a somewhat decent semi-circle formation of the adjoining tunnel, with Beksus and the newcomer a few steps behind.
Suddenly Kirnos appears next to Mal. He lines up his rifle against the two wrestling Barabel.
**"Thanks for the light"**
He fires towards them, but the shot barely glances the armored skin of one of them. The Barabel next to Nikki hisses threateningly and throws up a scaled hand to grab the soldier by the throat but Nikki manages to bring up his rifle in between them to block the attack. A blurred motion passes them by as the Barabel Cam shot charges in fury towards the stormtrooper. Cam easily sidesteps the clumsy attack though, without even a scratch.
From the pile of people in the middle of the tunnel erupts a volcano of blasterfire as Chaz discharges his repeater from lying down, throwing off both Barabel pummeling him as he stands up, almost screaming his lungs out. The second Barabel down the tunnel seems to take note of Chaz´s feat of strength and lines up a shot at him. The blast hits the somewhat disoriented soldier in the shoulder, nearly causing him to fall down again.
Acting on pure instinct, Nikki takes advantage of the Barabel´s attack. He drops his rifle and moves forward into the enemy, elbow coming first. He hears the beginning of a scream, but it is cut short, most likely by a dislocated jaw. Bringing his entire weight down upon the lizards knee, he hears something snap and his attacker falls to the ground, apparently in a lot of pain.
Annoyed with the medic sidestepping his attack, the Barabel attacking Gavin comes at it again, this time swinging his entire body around to gain momentum. Too late Gavin sees the lizards massive tail come up behind it, and his head starts to ring something enormously with pain.

Head ringing with pain, and balance trying to realign him, Gavin stumbles backwards, trying to find the trigger to his rifle. Finding it, he pulls it down, but his aim is way off, and sends the bolt up into the ceiling.
Having hung back a bit with Beksus, the newcomer kneels next to the fallen sergeant, quickly trying to find a pulse beneath the helmet. Getting up, he shouts to the rest of you.
**"He´s alive, but I´m sure he isn´t feeling well. Let´s show these lizards how we like them shooting our commanders"**
Lining up his rifle, he picks a shot at the Barabel who shot Beksus. The shot flies straight through the group and slams into the enemy, causing it to stumble back into the cave wall. The lizard next to Kirnos swings its tail at the stormtroopers legs, but the trooper manages to jump over it. The shooter that TK-9601 just hit roars back in fury, and unleashes a hailfire of blaster bolts against him.

*The small crowd gathered around the torch-lit ring murmurs hungrily, the way all beings who enjoy bloodsports do. A tall young human stands on one side of the ring and a squat, heavily muscled Devronian on the other. Both wear simple black trunks. Two beings sit on a raised platform that takes up one side of the ring. The first, a massive, older human male has a bald head and a mass of scar tissue where his right eye once was, and his bare chest is covered in scars. The second is a Twi'lek in rich robes with soft hands and greedy eyes.
**"Why is your son called Nekk?"** the Twi'lek asks.
**"Never heard of a Nekk Battle Dog? They're strong, vicious, and loyal to a fault. If ya can prove you're worth following, they'll go to the gates of Hell with ya. They work best with a leader, but they can survive without one. They just get a bit more vicious is all. Get a pack of em and ya got let em be for a week or two and expect some casualties. The most vicious of the bunch will come out on top. Look, fights over,"** the massive human points out as he sits forward.
**"Damnation, all ready?"** the Twi'lek exclaims.
**"Nekk dogs are like that my friend. Ha! Ya blink, you're a goner. Heh!"** the large man replies.
The young man in the ring stands over his fallen opponent, breathing heavily. He looks up to his father on the dais, who gives him a thumbs down gesture. The young human steps forward and brings his heel down with a brutal stomp on the Devaronian's skull with a sickening, popping crunch. The small crowd roars with blood-lust.
**"Yes,"** the grizzled old fighter grins with pride, **"My Nikki is vicious. Hahahahaha!"** he laughs.*
As the memory fades into the chaos around him Nikki looks down at the Barabel on the ground, determined not to leave a moving enemy behind him. He brings his knee to his chest and curb-stomps the being's skull, driving all his weight into the blow. Afterwards, he reaches into his belt for his Baradium core detonator and yells over the helmet coms, **"Back! Fall Back! Tighten formation! Chaz, chew em up! Kirnos, use a detonator!"**

Quickstepping backwards, and his eyes darting about, Mal centers on one of the Barabel down the tunnel and presses the trigger. In the chaos and turmoil of battle though, aiming is hard, and the shot slams into the wall. He nearly trips over as he feels something on the ground behind him, but is steadied by the new guy, still kneeling next to Beksus.
Dodging the furious charge from his attacker, Cam grabs the Barabel by the neck and presses his rifle into the creatures back. As the belly of the beast explodes in a cascade of entrails, the soldier drops his victim to the ground, turning back towards the attackers. Following behind Mal, Kirnos takes a few steps back to complete a semi-circle protecting Beksus with Mal and the newcomer. He lines up his rifle towards Chaz and his current company, but is forced to halt his shot as his ally gets into the line of fire just as he is about to let loose.
Thrashing about in pain, the Barabel at Nikki´s feet apparently has enough control of himself to lash out with his tail towards the stormtroopers legs. Though not hard enough to bring the sturdy Nikki down. Still standing tall in the "middle" of the intersection, Chaz wrestles with his two attackers, trying to fend them off. A clawed swipe to his head seems to bring him of balance, and erupts a new stream of curses. A full-body tackle from his second nemesis almost sends him flying, but instead he stagger to the ground, landing with his repeater rifle underneath him.
Clearly one to be impressed by strength, the second Barabel down the tunnel now turns his sights on Nikki. The blast slams into the wall, dangerously close to Nikki, but the adrenaline high soldier doesn´t even notice it. Instead, he keeps his attention on the ground beneath him, and brings his heel down with full force, catching the thrashing being at his feet in the shoulder, erupting even more violent screams and thrashing. Reaching into his belt, he pulls out a Concussion Grenade and starts to look for a good place to throw it.
In an act of kinship, the Barabel who had just delivered a ringing blow to Gavin hurls itself to the side and slams into Nikki, it´s jaws snapping viciously at his armored wrist holding the grenade, missing by a split second.

The injuries is making Gavin dizzy, he stumbles a bit, grateful that the lizard attacking him seeks out another goal, so in desperation he simply lets out another burst into the tunnel, hoping to catch some Barabels with a burst. He grits his teeth, hoping that this is over soon, so that he'll have time to focus more on the injuries and less on keeping himself alive.

Gavin abandons finesse for power, and slaps the switch that sends his rifle into autofire mode and presses the trigger. With the commotion in the tunnel though, he is hardly pressed to find somewhere to shoot without hitting his allies, and sends the burst down the tunnel towards the closest Barabel armed with a rifle. The shots rain around the lizard, and he shuns back a few steps. Following Gavin´s idea of striking at the opponents down the tunnel, TK-9601 draws a grenade out of his belt, and hurls it towards the two farthest enemies. the stormtrooper misjudges the distance though, and the grenade bounces down the tunnel, though the shockwave from the concussive blast can still be felt by those closest to it.
Hissing angrily, one of the closest Barabel takes sight on Mal, and hurls itself against him, snapping its jaws against his Glow Rod. The stormtrooper quickly shifts his stance to bring his pistol into the face of the opponent, but just as he fires, he feels the Barabel´s tail knock him in the side, throwing his shot off. Provoked by Gavin´s attack against him, the Barabel with the rifle lines his weapon up to return fire. The shot streaks over Gavin´s head, scorching the roof above.
His white armor stained with splashes of the Barabel he just disposed off, Cam stretches into his pocket and pulls out a grenade. Taking a split second to analyze the best use of the weapon, the young stormtrooper hurls the small metallic sphere in a high arc above the two lizards that have Chaz downed. The grenade sweeps over the lizards´s heads, erupting with a shocking blast behind them. The powerful wave shoots the two Barabel forward, leaving two bodies lying on the ground, motionless meatbags seemingly lacking any bone structure. Chaz´s body also rocks heavily, but his armor should have protected him from the main bulk of the blast.

Mal raises his gun and fires at the Barabel closest to him, but amidst all the chaos and turmoil he misses his mark. Taking a step forward next to him, Kirnos digs a blaster bolt into the side of the side of the Barabel, and the stench of burnt flesh can be felt through both of your helmets. Dashing forward, Kirnos kneels next to Chaz and grabs him by the neck slit of the armor to try and pull him out of harm´s way.
Still prone, the Barabel at Nikki´s feet tries to sit up and aims its vicious jaws at the stormtroopers legs, but Nikki is too fast for that. With rooted instincts the former street thug plants his foot squarely in the face of the attacker. The Barabel falls to the ground, and this time it doesn´t looks like he´s coming up anytime soon.
From down the hallway, one of the Barabel remaining there notices Kirnos trying to drag his fallen ally towards the back, and hisses threateningly. He raises his rifle and fires at Kirnos, but maybe a hint of fear is creeping into him as the Imperial soldiers starts to turn the battle around. He starts to back further down the tunnel, apparently scared.

Just barely withdrawing the arm holding the grenade, Nikki reacts again on pure instinct, and slams his helmeted head into the Barabel that crashes into him. The beast staggers backwards, clearly in great pain, and clasps its face, something most likely broken badly. In a flash of fury, the wounded lizard twists its body and delivers a massive swing of its tail that sends Nikki slamming back into the wall again. *Nikki takes 9 damage*

Gavin fires another shot down the tunnel, but his target sidesteps, and the shot goes just that - down the tunnel. TK-9601 joins forces with Gavin, sending a shower of blaster bolts towards the same enemy. The Barabel now right on front of Kirnos is still standing, and you can also see the confidence draining from his face. Seeing Kirnos dart forward to draw Chaz into safety, the lizard leaps at the trooper sweeping its sharp claws towards his side and nearly rupturing the weaker armor joint. *Kirnos takes 18 dmg*
Apparently realizing the battle as lost, the closest Barabel holding a rifle cries something in his native tongue before he starts off down the tunnel. He vanishes from the spreading light of Mal´s glow rod, as did his ally moments before.
Cursing openly, Cam displays a disciplined cold as he raises his rifle and places two rapid blaster bolts straight into the forehead of the Barabel that just slammed into Nikki. The creature falls to the ground with a loud thump. With the enemy either running or being dead, the chaotic nature of the small tunnel crossing rapidly fades.

In rapid response, Cam pulls up a glow rod from his belt and joins in with Mal in shining light over the tunnel. About 5-6 meters down the tunnel, a dark form is slumped against the floor, lying motionless. Apparently one of the Barabel were barely holding it together. Other than that though, the tunnel is empty as far as they can see, though a fading echo of rapid footsteps can still be heard. The surviving enemies must really have stepped on it.
TK-9601 quickly helps Nikki to remove the comm unit from Beksus, and then joins Gavin in trying to do what they can for the unconscious soldiers. Beksus appears to be in pretty decent shape, the heat of the blasterfire having luckily cauterized the wound, and his lounge doesn´t seem to be pierced. Chaz´s injuries on the other hand is harder to assess. Stripping of a few armor plates, Gavin finds only severe bruising, though he knows a concussion blast should not be underestimated. Those things are made to turn internal organs into jelly after all. He appears to have been decently protected by his armor though, and given time both troopers should be able to recover to 100%.
The comm is silent for a few moments, then a hiss of static indicates it´s going active.

After a few more moments of silence, the comm sparks again.

**"All right Theta Squad, you heard the man. Gav, get at least one of 'em conscious and make sure they both have rifles and glowrods. Mal, you're on point with me, next I want Cam and Gav, then Kirnos and 9601.

All right step quick we need to move A.S.A.P., which was ten minutes ago,"** pep talk/orders delivered, Nikki shoulders the com unit, then moves to the Barabel left on the floor, picking up his rifle and folding its stock before getting out his own glowrod along the way.
He shines the light on the Barabel, looking for signs of life and consciousness while he waits to lead what's left of his squad to what he fears is a messy death...

**"You´ve done well so far, but if you don´t mind, I´ll be taking it from here. Part of the reason I was assigned to this squad was because there was some worries about competent command, and I´m assuming I´ll be given charge after this mission"**
In the meanwhile, Gavin and Cam has managed to get Beksus conscious, and even though he hasn´t opened his eyes yet, Chaz did make some weird noise. Activating a glow rod and placing it in his lap, the two troopers strips the wounded of their respective weapons, and gets ready to move out. Kirnos and Mal seems ready to join them.

Mal watches the power struggle with interest. He is surprised that the one called Nikki pussed out so easily. The Emperor seemed to be the kind of person who would reward someone with the stones to take command. Guess he knows who has the stones in this squad. He adjusts his carbine's stock so he can use it one handed and carries his glow rod in the other. Next time he was bringing rigging tape. He takes his place in the column and gets ready to move out. He mutters a prayer silently for the trooper they were just leaving behind.

Luckily the tstormtrooper armor has internal channels, allowing for internal talk without producing any noise to the outside world. TK-9601 looks at Nikki, and by the tone coming over the comm channel, you can swear the man has to be smiling under the helmet.
**"If you tell someone you are here to see if they screw up, will you get their normal behavior? No, you get either increased effort that you cannot know if it will last beyond the scope you watch them, or a decrease in general performance due to nervousness.

Taking the point positions, Cam and Mal raises glow rods while instructing everyone else to keep theirs down. As the jog through the tunnels, Mal raises his hand to call a halt, signaling for the squad to scatter out towards the sides of the tunnel, and both the front men cuts their glow rods for a moment. Then suddenly Mal raises his rod again, shining a light at an interecting tunnel forming a T-cross with the one you are in (you coming in from below) as well as two very confused Barabel warriors, apparently blinded by the sudden and hasty shift in light moved directly at them.
Cam´s shotgun rings out twice in rapid succession in the tunnel, and the two lizards falls to the ground, pierced by shrapnel in several places.
((
Since I´m a nice guy, I allowed Nikki´s check to be replaced by an Aid Another action, since you both used the same skill and acted before I had time to resolve either man´s action. This allowed you to clear the high DC set for Stealth checks in this challenge, nice work. Unfortunately, you´ll have to wait until Sunday night before my NPCs do anything else, because now I´m gonna run to catch a train.

Almost before his rifle has stopped smoking, Cam moves quickly forward with the weapon raised. He swings it first right to check the tunnel that way. As he swings it towards the left tunnel, he catches a glmpse of a fleeting movement in the shadows, and the shotgun calls out two more shots in succession, and a damp "thud" is heard from inside the tunnel.
Moving the squad forward in a jogging motion, TK-9601 takes a quick look at both tunnels, before signaling Kirnos and Cam to take the lead into the left tunnel. Kirnos seems to hesitate for a moment, and his voice can then be heard over the comm.
**"Sir, I suggest we deploy a wide front, to better overwhelm the opposition. With their lack of advanced weaponry or skill with stolen arms, the increased risk to our front men will be minimal"**
Clearly not willing to spend much time standing, the new sergeant agrees after a moments contemplation.
**"You are right. Nikki, join them in the front, and we´ll keep three barrels up front, and three covering our backs"**
Rapidly assuming the new formation, the light jog of the squad continues.

Nikki briskly moves forward, motions efficient and swift, rifle and glowrod covering his part of the tunnel. *Step light, step quick. Read and adapt. Don't slow down,* he thinks as he brings his pit fighting skills back into play, where speed is key to victory. The stone underfoot doesn't hamper him as he moves with precision along with the rest of the front line.

Where troop transports really that expensive? Come on! The Empire has billions of planets worth of resources, and they couldn't spare enough for a transport.

Sometimes you have to shut everything else down in order to be an efficient fighter. Instincts have to become everything, because those who tries to think will end up thinking about why they have a hole in their chest. Luckily Nikki knows this. In his centered position of the front line, he is the first to pass around a bend in the tunnel, and he barely has time to register the shape that comes into the cone of his glow rod before it is upon him. Claws and fangs flashing before his eyes the massive weight pulls him own on his back, but the seasoned fighter manages to get his legs up as he goes down, pushing away with full strength and sending the attacker flying through the scattering rear line, where it barely hits the ground before a concentrated volley of blasterfire makes sure that it will stay down.
After a quick survey, it seems the Barabel was alone, and probably in a state of frenzy as well, and the squad contuniues their jog down the tunnel their assailant came from. Keeping up a good pace with full field gear on takes its toll, and weariness is starting to creep up on the squad. They are, however, a cut above your regular conscript, and can go on just as long on mental power as they can on stamina. Mal and the others are able to push on, even though by now they have been running for an extensive amount of time, stopping only to do battle with the enemy.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-03 12:07:23)

As you advance deeper into the tunnel network below Barab I, you get the feeling that you are moving into some sort of more "used" area. The tunnels starts to take the shape of being more well-crafted and not just natural phenomenon, and is also kept more clean than what you have been travelling through so far. It is precisely by noticing this that Cam is able to call a halt to the squad as he spots a patch of rather dirty tunnel ahead of you. Inspecting it closer, he reports that the dirt has been mixed with glass shards and small metallic pieces. Not enough to hurt boot-wearing soldiers, but a very crude alarm device, most likely devised to alert a waiting guard post ready to set an ambush. As most military tactics though, it can be turned against the user.
TK-9601 wastes little time in ordering the squad to take formation in double lines, with three soldiers in kneeling positions, and the rest standing tall above them. At his command, Cam dashes forward into the dirt area, his weight shattering glass underneath him, and you can hear the sound ringing out. Reaching about halfway through, he makes a rapid turn, and hurries back towards the rest of you. As he almost reaches you, a pair of enemies appears at the end of the tunnel, and he throws himself on the ground, crying out for you to fire. The plan works perfectly, and a focused hail of blaster shots turnd the end of the hallway into a deathtrap, felling the two Barabel quickly.
Dashing forward to get Cam on his feet, your new sergeant orders a full assault and as you storm aroud the corner, you spot a lone Barabel appearing both scared and confused. With little speed he raises a rifle towards you, but is returned a series of bolts that drops him quickly. The light shone by the bolts reveals a massive door at the end of the hallway.

**"Alright squad, prepare for battle. I´ll set the charge, and then I want Nikki, Cam and Mal to take the lead with the rest of us following up"**

Kind of a rethorical question, the segeant presses the final button on his detonator and jogs back towards the rest of you. A few seconds passes before the thermal charge detonates, blowing the door and a sizeable chunk of the stone it was fixed in apart, shredding rubble and smoke everywhere. Amidst the explosion ringing in your ears, you can hear a terrified scream that dies out quickly. Apparently there were someone guarding the door on the other side as well.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-10-08 21:09:58)

Beyond the door, through the smoke and debris, you find a large, circular chamber. Even though most of you´ve only seen it in holos, you get a flashback from the senate chamber on Coruscant. Around you, the chamber is raised about two meters, and from there it holds about five rows of increasing height, obviouslty meant for people to be seated at. As you pass in through the doorway, Gavin notes on seeing the arm of a Barabel by the wall. As Mal notes the same thing three meters in front of him, the usefulness of high grade explosives is put in a new light.
Luckily for you, the chamber is dimly lit by a few glow rods, enough light for your helmet sensors to allow you to see normally. Walking in towards the center of the chamber, you look around. The chamber is empty, with no sign of any Barabel, apart from the scattered pieces at the entrance. TK-9601 looks around and points towards the entrance you came in through.
**"Cam, keep an eye on that entrance, will you? The rest of you, search the room. Something´s not right here, there would not be guards outside an empty chamber"**

Grenade and rifle firmly in hand, he moves deeper into the room, moving to hug the wall on his side. He keeps an eye out as he climbs the stares, almost gun shy, imagining giant leaping lizards from thin air at every step.

The rest of the squad watches Nikki a bit warily as the trooper presses himself against the walls of the chamber, and moves in a crouch around the room. Spreading out, you search every square inch of the place, finding nothing. This is in fact, an empty chamber.
Visibly annoyed, TK-9601 orders another sweep of the chamber, and this time you do find something. At the center of the chamber is a small stone plate, only a few centimeters thick, obviously meant for speakers to stand on. A closer inspection reveals that this stone is in fact, movable. Wrestling it aside, you find a tunnel with a stairway leading down. This tunnel, however, is most certainly artificial, as it is barely wide enough to hold a single person walking in it.
**""All right boys, let´s go. Gavin, stay here with Cam and secure our way out. We´ll call for you if we need a medic**
Looking over at Nikki, TK-9601 motions towards the stairs.

He finds himself slightly shocked his that his helmet isn't spinning freely on his head due to the amazing amount of nerve-sweat pouring out of him. The cold dead thing in his gut won't shut up and it won't go away. *What's next?* he wonders, grinning tightly under his helmet, almost looking forward to the next instance of mind-blowing violence...

Nikki walks first down into the revealed stairway, with the rest of the squad following behind, keeping a few meters in between each others. Just like it looked from the chamber, the tunnel is too narrow to hold more then one person in breadth, and as it continues, the height of the ceiling starts to drop as well. Not quite so much as you not being able to walk upright, but the taller members of your squad finds that your helmets occasionally scrapes into the overhanging rock. You are pleased to see that the light from the chamber above siphons down into the tunnel in just enough quantity that you can see a little using your helmet sensors (though most of it is a green blur). You don´t know how long that´ll last though, the more twists and turns the tunnel takes, the greater the risk that you´ll run out of the light.
Carefully feeling ahead of him, Nikki avoids a painful revelation as he notices that he suddenly has solid rock in front of him. Quite obviously not a normal formation, he feels and looks around, and realizes that there is a narrow opening close to the floor, reaching up to his waist in height. If he wants to get through, he´ll obviously have to get down on his belly and crawl.

TK-9601´s voice is heard over the comm, but too late. As Nikki drops to his belly and crawls through the small hole he notices that it is only about a meter long or so. As he places one hand in front of the other and reaches out on the other side, he hears something scrape against the stone floor to his left, and is barely able to move the hand holding his gun as a vicious kick comes straight for it. In the light cone of his glow rod, he suddenly sees several Barabel swarming around the small hole, and as he turns his head straight forward, the underside of a Barabel foot hits him square in the face. Slightly disoriented, Nikki feels strong hands grab hold of his right arm and shoulder plates. *Nikki takes 8 dmg and is now grabbed*
Inside the tunnel, it is hard to see and understand what is going on, but the sound of feet moving, hissing noises, and a loud curse over the comm suggests something bad was on the other side of the hole.

Nikki thrashes and rolls wildly and manages to clear his grabbers and crawl back out of the small hole, nearly toppling Kirnos over in the process. The other gleans forward towards the hole and hurls a small metallic sphere into the chamber behind. He grabs Nikki by the collar and pulls him behind him, himself dropping prone. As the concussive blast ripples through the air, both soldiers shields their vision towards the ground before Kirnos raises his sights again and keeps his rifle trained on the opening. *Nikki takes 4 points of damage, and is prone in the square behind Kirnos, who is prone in the square just in front of the hole*
The screams intensifies as the charge blows in the room behind, and you can safely assume that at least one of the attackers got caught in the blast, and is hopefully nothing more than a wet stain on the wall by now. One of them seem more crafty than the others though, a large Barabel wearing worn-out battle armor, drops to his knees on the other side of the hole. Picking up the pistol Nikki dropped, he fires into the opening. Luckily, he seems to be firing blindly, and the shot slams into the wall inside the opening, mere decimeters in front of Kirnos.
Third in the line, TK-9601 also drops prone, and this time his voice is screaming on the comm.
**"Frontline, get ready to move. Rear line, one more charge! Overwhelm them!"**
As on command, Mal stumbles forward. With three on his brothers prone on the ground around him, he has a hard time finding good footing to walk, and he nearly trips in his rush as he steps on Kirnos´s thigh. Catching himself on the overhead wall in front of him, he slams his wrist against the "doorway top" of the hole, just like he was taught in training, with enough force that he looses the grip on his grenade, sending it flying into the chamber, sending another concussive shockwave through the air.

Taking a moment after the blast, Kirnos picks up his speed, crawling forward through the hole, prepared for the worst. As he pulls through, two of the Barabel warriors jump him, and even though he´s fending himself with both hands as well as can be seen, they are fast on top of him, preventing his standing up. Nikki accelerates quickly behind him, and as he sees the lizards jump his friend, he draws his rifle forward and fires into the heap of scales and flesh just above his ally´s head. He hits something, and one of the Barabel cries out in pain, and backs off a few steps.
Crawling up behind Nikki, TK-9601 looks up at Mal.

Screaming out in pain and aggression, Kirnos twists sharply to the side and Nikki can see a crude spear digging itself into the ground where his friend had been moments before, with enough force that the spear itself nearly breaks. Having gotten himself out of the hole, the brave stormtrooper scrambles to get to his feet and get his weapon up, but one of the Barabel thinks otherwise. Twisting itself through the air, the primitive warrior builds up such a momentum in his body that when his tail comes down on Kirnos´s back, one can almost hear the crack of white plastic. Kirnos drops to the ground with a heavy sound, and one of the lizards isn´t late to seize the opportunity. He pulls the blaster rifle from the hands of the downed soldier, but appears rather unfamiliar with the weapon as he presses the trigger, and the bolt fails to even get inside the hole.

His strikes are desperate and fierce, determined not to lose any more troopers, even if it cost him his life. His hands move in a flurry, crashing into the lizard's snout repeatedly with the intent of dazing the beast before spinning into a leg-sweep to drop the big creature.

Apparently filled with newfound energy, Nikki hauls his ass into the cave behind, and manages to get a hold of the Barabel with the rifle by the collar. Pulled into the stormtroopers upcoming fist, the Barabel cries out in pain and jerks back as Nikki twists his own body around on his back, hitting his opponent with a kick on the side of the kneecap, causing the scaly mass to fall to the ground next to him.
From the side of the cave comes another Barabel rushing to join the fight. Apparently wounded badly, it is hard to say whether the newcomer is attempting some sort of strategy, or if he is simply falling over, but he comes crashing down on Nikki with his full weight. Wrestling with the lizard, Nikki barely catches a glimpse of something shining in the outskirts of his vision and barely dodges to the side as a spearhead buries itself in the ground next to him. In a blurry moment he catches sight of the Barabel holding the spear. Larger and more muscular than the others, and clad in a simple suit of armor, it seems safe to say that he is some kind of leader. *Nikki takes 8 dmg*
In the tunnel behind Nikki, TK-9601 picks up speed in moving into the room. Crawling out into the room with his rifle in one hand, the soldier blocks an attack by the closest Barabel as he gets to his feet. Seemingly pleased with the turn of events, he calls out over the external speakers.

**"You always this whiny?"**
The higher ranking stormtrooper almost chuckles at Mal as he wrestles away one of the assailants attacking him. Mal crawls with all speed into the hole, but his exit is blocked when his ally and foe steps in front of it, cutting him off for a moment. The prone soldier catches a sight of Nikki tangling with an armored Barabel, and once the hole opening clears, a brilliant red bolt of fire sears out into the cave, but goes straight for the roof.
The felled Barabel twists around to smash his tail in Nikki´s stomach, but the stormtrooper manages to avert the blow. To a certain degree leaning on his prone foe, Nikki gets to his feet and delivers a solid kick of reinforced plastic armor against the armored Barabel´s jaw and is rewarded with a solid crack of bones. One of the other Barabel tries to intercept him, but is shoved aside by Nikki.
Obviously furious (well, who wouldn´t be after an armored foot to the jaw), the armored lizard reels back a few steps, reversing the grip on his spear. As the primitive weapon is shoved hard into Nikki´s chest, it becomes painfully obvious that you don´t need advanced technology to inflict great pain, and any dislike Nikki had for the design of his armor gets itself a big bruise.
Next to the hole, another blaster bolts rings out, released by TK-9601, but his assailant has apparently gotten a hand on the gun, and the shot flies out into the cave.

A white armored foot lands in the Barabel's stomach/groin area, which greatly surprises Nikki, *Sure as hell ain't mine, who?* He turns to see Mal, glad somebody had followed his foolhardy impromptu charge. His chest aches and he struggles to catch his breath before stepping into the spear-lizard's reach, feinting with a leg kick, then following up with an uppercut that would make his daddy proud. His and the lizard's, probably.

It is hard to tell if a reptilian is laughing, or if he is simply, making that usual hissing noise they tend to do, but perhaps that sound is a kind of laughter. At least it is what meets Mal as his kick is intercepted by a heavily backed up and armored side of the Barabel in front of him. A hiss and a wicked grin is what meets him as the Barabel shoves his attack aside, and prepares for a new attack.
Obviously content to leave their leader to fend for himself against the two stormtroopers, the rest of the pack turns their attention against the lone TK-9601. Pressing him up against the wall, one of them manages to sweep the feet from underneath the sergeant, causing him to drop into an almost sitting position against the wall. Dodging to the side, he narrowly avoids a kick aimed for his head.
Taking advantage of the slight distraction offered by Mal, Nikki steps in close to his opponent. Feinting with a low kick, he delivers a solid uppercut to the Barabel´s jaw, which sends it staggering backwards. For a moment it seems like it lunges for a final strike, but as the spear tip dips into the floor, and the creature goes down halfway, it seems clear that it is out cold. In a moment of uncanny insight, Nikki takes a step to the side, and strikes backwards with his elbow, and is awarded with a short scream as his armored elbow connects with a Barabel jaw. As he turns to look behind him, the unnatural angle between the lizards jaw and neck seems to imply a case of death.
The sounds of a blaster firing, and that of a body falling to the floor erupts from where TK-9601 is sitting, and one of the Barabel hits the ground with smoke coming up from a hole in his shoulder. Diving to the side in a roll, the sergeant comes up into a kneeling position with his weapon trained on the last of the attackers still standing. With a mixed look of fury, defeat, and defiance, the Barabel slowly raises its hands above its head in a surrendering gesture.

OK, so combat has ended, in case anyone were wondering

Nikki snaps, not realizing the Barabel beneath him is out of the fight. He viciously curb stomps the creature, a wordless racket of rage tearing its way through the helmet coms. Even after the being is certainly dead he continues to stomp, turning his boot into a bloody mess almost all the way to the knee. He stops on his own, looking down and then around at what's left of his squad. His movements at this point are nervous, shaky from the adrenaline come-down. He looks for and gathers his rifle and pistol quietly, not meeting the eyes of any of the squad. He'd seen men loose it before. Some made it, some didn't. He doesn't know if he will. *I'll find out soon though. Either they'll boot me from the squad or we'll see action again and I'll freeze. Damn,* he thinks as he pretends he didn't just loose his mind temporarily.

Mal watches Nikki go berserk on the corpse of the barabel leader. He can understand the feeling. The dark, the endless ambushes and tunnels could get to the best soldier. Once his rage is spent he pats Nikki on the back reassuringly.
**"Let it go Nikki, we're alive they aren't. Win for us."**
He surveys the damage and starts scan the area.
**"What's next?"**

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-02 05:55:34)

You can hear the flick of a switch and see a series of blue energy circles release from TK-9601´s rifle, and as they engulf the last standing Barabel, it falls to the ground. Moving over to kick Kirnos´s unconscious form, the sergeant looks at his remaining soldiers.
**"We comm HQ and wait for orders. Though this was supposed to be the last coordinated push in our efforts in this region. If we are lucky, our allies have met with similar success as well, and if so is the case then this should be over"**
He looks at the armored Barabel and then over at Nikki.
**"I don´t blame you, but I´m guessing command would have wanted him alive. The armor bears the insignia of one of the more prominent clans in this region, and thorough interrogation could have shed some light on the reasons behind this unexpected rebellion. Though if we tell them he died in battle, I doubt anyone will really care"**
===========================================================================================================================
Calling down the remainder of Theta squad, Gavin manages to get Kirnos back on his feet by injecting him with some sort of stimulant. With all six soldiers now back and assembled, a call is made to HQ, and your expectations are confirmed: Reports have been flowing in from various portions of the planet, and in general it seems like resistance has been crushed. Small pockets of rebels still remains, but efforts are being coordinated to round them in, and the army has been called in to assist in the hunt, as well as to reestablish the Imperial garrison on Barab I and relieve the soldiers of the 118th.
Tying up the unconscious prisoner, Cam and Kirnos are charged with carrying him back to base, the squad sets off. As suspected, the room you fought the Barabel in had another entrance, and even though reports from nearby allied squads confirms no enemy presence, TK-9601 orders no lowering of weaponry or attention before hitting the open space. Transport vehicles are said to have been dispatched to carry you back to base, as the day has yet again broke, and Barab I´s surface is a radiated deathtrap.
((
Good work guys, it seems like you did it. You may roleplay as much as you wish during the march, but if the activity is low, I´ll move on to debrief shortly.

Nikki nods in response to both Mal and 9601, not meeting either's gaze. He isn't ashamed of killing the beast, or the way he did it, he's ashamed of loosing control. He'd killed many times before becoming a Stormtrooper, but never without intending to. He'd never fought in tight, light-less tunnels either, or against multiple opponents, or with brothers depending on him.
He rifles the corpse, looking for anything of use to take back to command. Data of any kind could help considering he killed a valuable asset in a fit of rage. He takes point and stays sharp, his determination to get off Barab 1, and far away from dark tunnels, has redoubled. *Maybe… maybe 9601 is the best choice for CO. He might make a stupid decision now and then, but he didn't lose it either…* he thinks as they make their way to the Evac point.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-03 18:07:13)

Nikki finds little of value on the corpse. The warrior seems to have chosen to keep only what he needed for battle on him, and the only thing Nikki finds is a short and serrated dagger, obviously meant as a backup weapon.
As they starts the walk back to base, Gavin checks around the squad to see if anyone needs medical attention, and is relieved when it seems no one has sustained any serious injury. Kirnos appears to be fine, and it seems that all he really took was a powerful blow to the head, but the helmet seems to have protected him from anything more serious than at most a light concussion. Carrying the lower half of the unconscious lizard on his shoulder, he walks next to Mal.
**"Thanks for not leaving me in there. They got a clear hit at my temple, and if there´s something lacking in these helmets, it´s padding. Or perhaps I just need to get a little more thick-headed"**
================================================================================================================================
As he walks point, Nikki notices a light cone from a glow rod come up next to him. While it is seemingly impossible to make out who is underneath the white plastic, it is amazing how little time you have to spend together to learn a persons stance, walk, and build and be able to identify him by them. He identifies the soldier now walking up next to him as no one other than his new sergeant. Not turning particularly to Nikki, he walks with a straight up stance, keeping his weapon slightly lowered, but ready enough to be used at a moments notice.
**"How are you doing?"**

**"Not sure. Time to cool off, unwind, maybe then I'll know. Hopefully, I'll figure it out before the next contact. May need to schedule some time with the head-medic, I don't know,"** Nikki responds, not making eye, or goggle, contact. He keeps watching what he's doing, looking for any threats. **"Heh, maybe my old man knew. Maybe he called me Nekk and Nekk-Dog for more than just the way I fight. Never happened before, that I know of. Old man would do that, from time to time. He never remembered it afterwards. He knew it when he saw it, he knew his own handiwork. No doubts in anyone's heads that back there is mine,"** his words drift off, done with his ramble.

**"As long as you are aware of it, you can learn to control it. And believe me, I´ve seen new recruits lose it in the field before, and I prefer those who react with violence to those who completely paralyzes with fear"**
Somewhere in the far distance, it seems like the tunnel is getting brighter.
**"What I need to know though, is that you will work on it. I will be your commander from now on, and I don´t command brutes, I command *soldiers*. And soldiers have discipline, they have restraint. That is what makes them superior to brutes. A man can survive on the streets just by being bigger and badder than everyone else, but eventually someone bigger comes along and puts him in his place. And while I am reluctant to draw parallels between us and street gangs, you rarely see a single brute run the underworld all alone, do you?"**
Leaving Nikki to sort out things for himself, the sergeant moves back in line to talk with Cam, and it seems that the two are at least somewhat familiar.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-05 19:36:19)

Luckily enough, the trip back to exfil goes without trouble. Shortly before the light begins to shine really bright, you are met with two other squads, who have also been operating in your area. Some of them seems rather annoyed at the presence of your prisoner, but no one voices any concern.
Reaching your exfil point safely, you get into an armored transport that carries you through the radiated wasteland that is Barab I during the day, and soon you are on board a shuttle, heading back to the *Fury*. As you disembark in the hangar, you can see the shape of yet another huge Star Destroyer hanging in space, and you spot a shuttle leaving its hangar, heading towards the planets surface, as opposed to the others you can see coming from the surface.
Almost immediately, TK-9601 and Kirnos are called away for a debriefing meeting with the other commanders, and the rest of you are directed to a smaller room, wher you can relax and await their arrival for a more private and informal debrief. The environment is quite relaxed, and you will not be court martialled for at least removing your helmets.

Nikki takes off his helmet and resists the urge to sling it across the room, but barely. *Damned hunk of junk,* he thinks as he sets it down on the bench next to him and removes his gauntlets. He runs his hands over his shaven head, feeling the stubble already sprouting. He notices the smell almost instantly, [d]"Refresher. Can't karking wait to hit the refresher," he says as he breaks out his standard issue maintenance kit and strips his rifle down, cleaning and calibrating it to pass the time. Once done, he does the same to his pistol, whether it needs it or not. Then he checks his gauntlets and boots for cracking as he remembers all the melee he saw planet-side.

Mal takes his helmet off and runs his hand through his sweaty hair. These suits where supposed to be climate controlled but his never seemed to work quiet right. He agreed with Nikki about the fresher. He felt exhausted the adrenaline crash would be coming soon and he wanted to just lay down and sleep for a standard day. Only sheer willpower kept him on his feet.
He sits down next to Nikki and starts field stripping his rifle without thinking about it. His training takes over and his mind clears as muscle memory takes over and the rifle comes apart. He thinks about trying to talk to Nikki but can't really think of much to talk about. So what about those lizards seems kind of lame way to start. So he doesn't he just cleans his weapon quietly.

Settling down, your comrades also takes of their helmets, revealing sweaty, dirty and in some cases bruised, faces. Cam, blonde hair all in a mess an sticking to his head like a cap proceeds to also take off his arm pieces and gloves.
After a while, Kirnos and the sergeant enters the room, Kirnos limping a little, obviously more hurt than it seemed planetside when adrenaline was pumping through him. It seems to be just a minor injury though, and he takes a seat at the table with the rest of you. TK-9601 moves to the end of the table, taking his helmet off and resting his hands on the chair in front of him.
**"Well, this debriefing will pretty much be nothing special. Just as was reported planetside, the majority of the resistance has been crushed, and reinforcements have arrived to deal with whatever insurgents remains, as well as to restore the overthrown garrison. Unfortunately, intelligence still has found no leads as to what caused the rebellion in the first place, which have to be considered a small drawback. However, order has been restored, and that was the main focus of this campaign"**
He pauses and looks over his squad, smiling slightly at the "armor looks" of each soldier.
**"I can also report that your comrades have been recovering well, but may be out of active duty for a little while longer"**
Settling down into the chair in front of him, he continued.
**"What remains to do before our mission is officially concluded though, is a quick internal debrief. I also thought it prudent to give some more information on myself, since I´ll be leading this squad from now on. But first, let´s hear any spontaneous comments on our performance during the mission"**

**"That was hell. Equipment unsuited to the terrain, unstable and ill prepared intel, the works. We still kicked lizard arse though, didn't we?"** Nikki pipes up, head down still working on his rifle, grime marking the sweat trails off his bald head. He lifts his gaze to meet the squad's, **"No losses. Casualties aplenty, but no deaths. Could have been worse,"** he finishes as his gaze comes to 9601, the trooper who sent them through that hole into the waiting enemy. Nikki is content to leave it given his own outburst afterwards, but it was still a foolish call in his eyes.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-09 11:44:39)

TK-9601 appeared to be unaffected by Nikki´s gaze.
**"War is hell, I thought they told you that at the academy. But you are correct in that we prevailed, and even did so without any permanent losses. On the account of equipment, I guess command thinks a glow rod and helmet sensors are enough to operate in a subterranean environment, and frankly so do I. But if you feel that you have the means to persuade the bureaucrats at the top to equip the legion, I won´t stand in your way"**
Smiling, he pulled of his gloves and scratched the top of his head, a short-trimmed military haircut that was on the brighter side of the color spectrum.
**"Jokes aside though, I agree with you to a point. But it is my experience that too much sophisticated equipment makes soldiers slack off, and lose their edge. But if we are ever deployed to a similar location, I will make sure to put in an order for some lights that are attachable to a rifle, so you can use both hands to fire"**

**Yea I'm sure being able to see in the dark while keeping our hands free would make us way softer than stumbling around in the dark with glow rods and pistol. Why didn't we just blow that blockage in the cave instead crawling through into an ambush?"**
Mal finishes his cleaning job and quickly puts it back together the last piece snapping ton place to punctuate his final question.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-10 05:47:19)

TK-9601 responded to the question with a small nod, and a look that seemed to say that he didn´t mind people having opinions about his orders, but that he was standing by his decisions.
**"Because, we were tasked to neutralize the opposition in that sector. It seemed highly unlikely that they would have barricaded themselves in a dead end, and if we had remained passive and just lobbed explosives in there, the possibility for them simply escaping was too high. That could have lead to them falling upon another squad operating in the same region by surprise, and thus have unnecessarily risked the lives of our allies, or at the very least failed in our objective to neutralize them. As to blowing up the wall, I´m not really sure if I like the idea of risking a cave-in"**
Clearing his throat, he continued.
**"Besides, as I see it, we were better armed, armored and most likely trained than our opposition, and that one man should be able to hold his own while the rest of us pushed through seemed like a given"**
With the last word, he casts a glance and smile at Kirnos, who responds with a slightly embarrassed chuckle.
**"My fault boss, he got a lucky shot in the spleen, that´s all"**

Nikki sighs as he finishes recalibrating his pistol and holsters it, then starts putting his gauntlets back on, **"Fair enough. What's next?"** he asks, not seeing any point arguing with the new CO on command decisions. *We did make it out, regardless,* he thinks as he lifts his rifle and helmet.

## Re: Chapter II - Suppressing the Beasts

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-11 08:43:35)

**"Don´t get me wrong, I appreciate your honesty in bringing up questions regarding command decisions, as long as they are brought up at the appropriate time. We work as a squad, and thus it is important to me that you have at least a basic understanding of the grounds I base my decisions on. Which brings me to our next assignment"**
He pauses for a moment, and turns to Kirnos. The corporal nods and takes the word.
**"As already said, we did pull through. However, command has deemed that was more due to individual skill from each soldier, than our ability to work as a squad. While it was urged to take into account that many of us are rather new in the field, it has been decided that more training in the field is required. Therefore, we are to report to Carida in one standard day, to start a 3 month training regimen with focus on squad tactics and operations.
Any questions?"**

**"Do we get any liberty? I don't know about you but I could use a night out after nearly dying several times in the last few days."**
Mal puts his rifle away and starts looking over his armor for any spots that might need repair or replacement. He glances at Nikki to gauge his reaction to their new squad leader's attitude. He just wants someone in charge who wasn't gonna get them killed for no reason.

Nikki meets Mal's eyes before nodding to Kirnos and 9601, **"Let's do it then. Gotta second Mal here, some off duty leave would be great. Last thing, sergeant, we only gonna know you by your trooper number?"** he asks, deciding to put his trust in the man and liking the idea of squad based training.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-12-13 18:21:32)

**"Sorry boys, it looks like any extended leave will not be in question this time. As I said, we are to report to the Carida Academy in one standard day. I do not think we will be on 24 hour duty though…at least I hope so"**
Kirnos leaned back in his chair and turned to TK-9601, who smiled a bit when Nikki asked his question.
**"Don´t you know that´s how the big boys in grey wants us to be? Anonymous numbers, expendable and generic. Sometimes I think they secretly wishes the Empire still had an army of clones…"**
Shaking his head and looking into the table for a moment, he continued.
**"The era of clones is over though, and at least most of us are human these days. You can call me Jack, since that is my name, and in fact that is all the name I have these days. I was born on Alderaan, to a family of the stuffiest nobles you can imagine. Suffice to say, my parents wanted me to just follow suite and become superior, condescending, and arrogant just like them. You can guess how pleased they were when I told them I was joining the military, and not even the officer academy, but just the ground forces as well.
Anyway, I did my basic training on Carida, like I guess a lot of you did, and I was actually classmate with Cam over there. I´ve been off active field duty for about a year though, passing through the basic parts of officer training, but now I´m back to perform my field practice as your CO. And I´m afraid that´s pretty much all the interesting things there is to know about me"**
