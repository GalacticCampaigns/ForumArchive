# [Heart Of Shadows] (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-14 22:49:40)

The twin suns of Tatooine bear down hard on Awne as her eyes crack open. The cockpit is a mutilated collection of steel wreckage and holes. She is pinned down by metal plates and some bins, she cannot move. Her entire body aches and she cannot get her bearings. Directly over her she sees a large hole where the sunlight is coming from, and she cannot see anyone else in the cockpit. Wait a second...she sees an arm underneath a pile of wreckage. If she could somehow get to him.

Awne coughs and winces in pain as she comes to, the bins and plates making her breathing labored. She looks around at the mess of the ship and sighs *'please say the otherrs made it…'* She thinks. Seeing an arm to her side she tries to reach for it. She sighs as she can't reach him and looks to the pile on her trying to move slightly, no luck. She reaches her arm out to the other arm again and streatchs *'If…If I could just…move..just a little…'* She growls and streatchs more straining herself and thinking only of getting to the arm, to a pack member, she just needed more room...she just...just.... *'I need these things off!!!'*

*Awne's Use the Force check 9+7=16*
Awne focuses on her years of martial arts training with her father, trying to think of a way out of this situation. She closed her eyes and hoped for a way out. She was not strong enough to lift this debris. Her father had always instructed to remain calm in adversity, so she calmed herself. As Awne took a deep breath, she heard the metal plating slightly move off of her. She couldn't believe what was happening. Who was moving this? Also, she could feel the presence of some of her comrades outside. This was a strange feeling to her. Although she had moved the metal, it was not enough to free herself.

### **zerah** (2007-11-14 23:59:00)

Awne sighs as she's able to breathe a little easier, she feels a little light headed but that's all. now that the debris had moved a little she tries to reach the arm all while yelling for the others outside "Anyone alive??"

Awne sighs and thinks..remembering the clearing she meditated at, her training, the voice that tells her to focus..focus on the plates covering her..

*Awne's Use the Force check 6+7+1=14. Sorry Radon, you are unconscious.*
Awne concentrates even more, and she feels a strange sensation flowing through her body. The feeling is similar to what she felt on Telares station, however, this was a more positive feeling. The wreckage slowly creaked off her, just enough for her to slither out of the debris. She was amazed, how in the galaxy did this debris just float off her? It was easily apparent, but things took a drastic turn in her life when she stepped on Telares station.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **zerah** (2007-11-15 03:29:41)

Awne moves out from under the debris and slowly crawls to the hand, mindful that her body aches with each movement, her tail drags on the floor not having the strength to lift it. *'I need to ask someone about these…these things that keep happening to me..debrris..just lifting off of me..I wonderr what it is..No..focus Awne..need to help the otherrs.'* With these thoughts she moves to the arm, carefully removing debris as best she can.

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-15 03:35:52)

Awne lifts the debris off the person, and sure enough, you see Rith laying motionless. His black TIE uniform dirty and it has some tears. You are unable to tell if he's breathing with his suit on.

### **zerah** (2007-11-15 03:50:26)

"Rrith..oh no..oh no oh no what do I do..what do I do..." she bites her lip as she thinks what to do. The armor..she can't see if he's breathing..*'I'm no medic…oh..whateverr listens please…please help me, Rrith forgive me.'* she prays and wishes, as she moves to remove the top part of the imperials armor

*Awne's Treat Injury 2+3=5*
Awne gets next to Rith and she just can't seem to make a good decision on what to do with him. She takes off the top part of his armor and observes that he is breathing, but she can't make a good evaluation as to exactly what is wrong with him. Awne feels very hungry/thirsty...and she can't seem to shake that feeling.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **zerah** (2007-11-15 15:28:21)

Awne bites her lip, wishing she had paid more attention when that medic was trying to teach her first aid. Seeing as Rith was breathing she decides she needed to find Woroken. Not knowing if he can hear her she leans down to whisper to Rith "I'll be rright back, just hang on." She stands and walks slowly and carefully through the remains of the ship looking for the wookiee and the others.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-15 15:36:44)

*Awne's Perception 6+7=13*
The first thing Awne notices is that you are only in what's left of the Cockpit. If there is any parts left of the ship, you can't see them. Awne walks out of the cockpit and sees the immense sea of sand of Tatooine. It seems you crashed quite close to a canyon, as there are also some moutains directly to your west. The twin suns are in high noon. The heat seems to piercing through the Farghul's fur like a blinding light beam through pure darkness. Awne strains her eyes against the sunlight and sees parts of the ship to her north. The heat rising from the sand is distoring her view of everything around her. Her lips are crackling dry, and so is her tongue. There is no wind, and it was too much to bear for someone with fur. She walks up to the pile of ship wreckage and sees Red Team strewn out in the sand, it seems as if they were ejected from the crashing ship. They all seem to be out cold. Awne can guess that the ship crashed and split apart, then the cockpit slid away from the rest of the ship.

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-16 14:50:15)

*Awne's Treat Injury check 1+13=14*
Awne looked at the poor Wookiee. He seemed battered and his fur is covered in sand. Everyone was in pain, and she could feel it. Indeed, Awne's senses have become more keen since the events on the Telares station. Also, something else struck Awne as strange, she could feel a powerful aura coming from Woroken. She kneeled next to Woroken and checked his breathing, she felt powerful breaths hit her cheek. Everything seemed ok, but the twin suns of Tatooine were really hitting hard on the fallen Red Team. All of them needed to get out of the sun quick, and get water. She studied Woroken and wasn't sure if it was better to wake Woroken or let him sleep.
*Woroken make an endurance check please.*

*Woroken's Endurance check 4+14=18. Awne and Woroken gain 50 experience points.* 
Awne observes Woroken and sees that the best thing to do would just be to awaken him now. She pulls a medpac out and uses a smelling salt on Woroken. Woroken awakes to find the intense suns beating down on him.

"Wow." That was the first thought that sprung to Woroken's mind as he sat up in the intense heat and sun. He tried to get his wits about him, and it took several seconds for him to realize that he was, indeed, alive. He was relieved to see the visage of his friend, Awne looking back at him. She looked distraught, however.
Woroken got to his feet as quickly as possible, testing to be sure his legs would support his mass. He rose unsteadily and surveyed the situation. It was too damn hot, that was for sure. To his surprise, he felt much stronger than he would have expected. At least strong for havng lived through a starship crash.
Awne quickly filled him on on what was happening. She pointed in Rith's direction. Woroken moved to the side of the tie fighter pilot, while motioning for Awne to check on the others.
*Treat Injury on Rith +7. Will burn a medpac, if necessary.*

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **zerah** (2007-11-16 15:24:37)

Awne sighs with a smile seeing that the real medic was attending to Rith. She waits for a moment before turning back to the others on the ground, checking on Radon first then Ben.

Rith jumps up astounded at the destruction and slightly more at the fact that he survived. Looking around at the ones still unconcious. Rith steps over to Radon's unconcious body and stares down at the man. "What happened?"

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **zerah** (2007-11-16 18:40:15)

Awne looks back to where the ship is then at the body of the podracer and sighs. she grabs his arms and drags him back to the shade of this ship. Once there she smiles at the now awake Rith and motions for wookiee to let Radon sleep awhile longer. With that she moves to Ben, to check on him. The sun was getting to her, she wasn't use to this kind of heat but like all farghul when put against heat, she was panting softly to stay cool.

Woroken saw Awne visibly struggling while attempting to treat Ben. She was giving much effort, but clearly was inexperienced at treating injured creatures. He stepped out of the cool(er) shade, and bends to the other side of Ben. He motions for Awne to give him the salt capsule and let him try his hand with Ben.
*Treat injury +7. Also, is Vor'en out or is he conscious? If he is out, I will go to try and wake him as well.*

*Bennosuke's Endurance Check 9+0=9; Vor'en's Endurance check 14+2=16, Woroken's treat injury 7+10=17. Woroken and Vor'en both get 50 experience.*
Woroken and Awne try to tend to Bennosuke's ailment, however...Woroken points out that it would be best to let him rest in the shade of the cockpit as well. Once Woroken gets Ben moved to shade, he walks back out of the cockpit to Vor'en. He seems to be breathing and ok. Woroken pulls a smelling salt out of his medpac and uses it to wake Vor'en. Vor'en seems very groggy and confused in the heat of Tatooine. Woroken can see the members were ejected from the other half of the cockpit about twenty-five meters away. It seemed that the cockpit split off from the main portion of the ship, then the cockpit split in two...spilling out Red team and the pilot corpses.

Awne sighs and takes a seat slowly beside Rith and Radon, taking out a ration from her utility belt and eating it slowly along with a water packet. She sighs and looks to the others "We should all eat and drrink something, afterr everrything we went thrrough and now with this blasted heat.." she sighs her tail flicking in annoyancy "I hate heat." she mutters as she takes another bite. She looks up at the Imperial and tugs on his hand to get his attention "You ok? you werre underr a lot of metal..so was I..still don't underrstand how that stuff moved on it's own. " she trails off into her thoughts a frown on her features.

Awne feels the intense heat sweltering as she scans Tatooine, she can see nothing for miles except for the dark brown canyon walls. The heat rising from the sand distorts everything within view, and she can't see the remnants of the ship except for the cockpit. She knows they have to do something about the heat besides just sitting in the shade, or the results could be disastrous.

Awne frowns, she really wasn't made for this kind of terran, trees were more her specialty. She continues to pant, the heat was really starting to bother her. She looks over to the two with field kits and spies the sunshield. She stands and walks to the wookie "Can I help? bet this heat is even morre unpleasent then it is forr me. How you holding up?"

Woroken tries to pull off what he hopes is a smile as an answer to the Farghul's query. He doubted it worked, however. He nodded, hoping that wouldwork a little better. Woroken wasn't big on complainers. With all that being said, however, Woroken did not leave the shade while fiddling with his sunshield roll.

Everything is hazy, and Bennosuke feels himself floating. It is warm again, and kind of wet. Is he sweating really bad? Did he die in that crash? Maybe he's bleeding! Ben opens his eyes, but he can'ts seeem to move his body. Blood is pooling up around his legs, and his starting to crawl its way towards his stomach. But the blood is not coming from him. Whose blood is it? It's now sticking to his belly button and his feet are drowned in it. Hot and dark red. Figures start to take shape around him. First his father and brother, both burned and bleeding, bleeding from the eyes and mouths. Pooring blood from their bodies. Then the two Wampa gang bangers that he killed. They paw and poke at him. Then the Toydorian that Ben tried so hard to save. And the pilots. All dead, all bleeding, drowning Ben with their warm blood. "I tried to save you" Ben tries to say, but the words won't come out "I'm sorry, I tried."

Rith stands to his feet. Sitting and whining about the heat was not getting anyone anywhere. Looking towards the cockpit Rith tries to determine what kind of shape its in and if perhaps the comm might still be in good enough repair that they could rig it to send a short range signal.

One hour has passed on Tatooine. Woroken managed to use a sunshield roll to cover up a big hole in the Cockpit, and it served as a decent place to rest away from the intense sunlight. *Anyone in the cockpit receives +2 bonus to survival check rolls for the sunshield.*Red Team rests in the cockpit, and everyone who was unconscious has now awaken, and they have no real pain. The only problem is a few cuts and bruises.
Rith studies the control console of the destroyed cockpit as Red Team sits around trying to handle the weather. He notices only someone skilled in Mechanics or Computers could be able to begin repairs on the communications, if it was even possible. But as Rith is using his senses, he hears something in the distance.

*Woroken is eating now. I will knock off a ration from his sheet.*
As yesterday's meal seemed so long ago, Woroken decided it was time to pop his ration capsules. "Not very tasty, but plenty filling," he thought. The wookiee looked around, seeing if anyone else was eating. Although he was miserable, lying under the sunshield roll in the wreckage of the ship, he felt fairly good. He made a mental note to check the rest of Red Team and make sure eveyone had some rations. He had always made a point of carrying a week's worth, plus three days, just to be on the safe side. He might not be able to buy someone a meal out here, but he could give someone a meal, so to speak, if one of the team was in need. Practically, if they were to survive, all of them need to be hearty and strong to get through the hellish nature of the planet. Hopefully they would be sucessessful in getting the comm back online.

She looks at each memeber, no one looked comfortable..well..except maybe the natives but then they were use to this weather. She looked up at the Imperial to see him standing very still, almost like.. "Hey Rrith you ok? Whatcha listening to?"

Radon awoke from, surprisingly, the best, dreamless rest he's ever had. Still, the fact that he awoke to see himself inside the cockpit, protected only from the scorch of his home planet's twin suns by someone's sunshield, meant that he was far from being well-rested. It was almost unbearably hot, as Tatooine was wont to be, but knowing he was very much alive, however, was more than just a consolation.
He sat up from where the others had lain him, seeing the others all around the broken cockpit. "Good morning," he manages to squeak. Looking to his side, he sees the wookiee partaking of a ration, and decides that he probably should take one too, taking out one of his own from his person and popping a welcome, if not tasty, meal in his mouth.
Radon turns when Awne questions the Imperial. He couldn't hear anything himself, and judging from his bruises as well as the sharp pains that he felt when he tried to move, he wasn't in any position to do any looking out. Whatever it was, the still-living podracer only hoped it was either a speeder or a sand crawler. The last thing they needed now was to be 'rescued' by Tusken Raiders.
His thoughts turned to distress calls. He silently congratulated himself for asking for the Falsoor Headmaster's comlink frequency. The only problem was that his comlink wasn't the model that was strong enough to send a signal to the orbiting space station - if they were even still there. His face turned somber from that thought - after all, the Imperials had already attacked a transport. That meant they could just as easily use their Star Destroyer against the station. As much as he hated to admit it, Radon would've been more than willing to accept Republic assistance at this point. For now, all he could do was keep his all-temperature cloak snuggly wrapped around him as finished his ration.

Rith listens closely to the sound in the distance, it sounds like Sand People to him. Although he hears the Sand People, he can't estimate how far away they are. More than likely they are investigating the crashed ship to scavenge equipment.
While Rith is observing these sounds, it seems Radon is visibly being affected by the extreme heat. While Red Team is sitting around talking, Radon seems to be faring worse than the others.

She calls back to the wookiee looking concerned at the human before her.

The wookiee, finishing the last of his rations, responds to Awne's beckoning. Woroken got to his feet, and went to look at the podracer, trying to stay out of the boiling hot suns.
It did not take a surgeon to figure out that Radon was sufferring from heatstroke. It was best to stop it now, at its relatively minor stage, if possible, before Radon's condition got really bad. Woroken figured this would be the time to use one of the medpacs that Derak had given him yesterday afternoon. A little water, some salve, and hopefully Radon would be right back to normal.

With the great majority of his concentration forcused on treating Radon, the wookiee did not really have an opportunity to respond to Rith's comment about leaving Radon behind. Woroken gave a quick stern glance in Awne's direction, hoping she would be able to read his expression and get Rith away from the makeshift "treatment center" before things got ugly. There certainly would be no leaving anyone behind, that much was sure. Not only had Woroken promised Orwen that he would take care of the team, but his sense of personal honor would not allow him to leave an injured teammate behind.

Awne frowns at the imperial and flicks her tail to hit him over the head "be nice, we have to worrk togetherr, and no one's leaving anyone." She takes Rith by the hand and drags him away from the Wookiee and the podracer. She pushes Rith to sit down and sits in front of him, her tail flicking from side to side "So...what's a Sand perrson? arre they made of sand orr something?"

After doing all he could for the podracer and seeing that Radon was resting easily, the wookiee mind shifted suddenly to the fact that someone had just said sand people were coming. Taking a deep breath, Woroken steps out from under the makshift tent of metal and sunshield rolls, and steps out into the intense heat and sun for a look see.

Woroken steps outside the cockpit and looks around. He can see nothing but sand and canyon walls that strech on for miles. The suns are still high in the sky, and he imagines he might be able to see better if he had electrobinoculars or something.

Heatstroke. Radon didn't need a medic to tell what his own condition was, having suffered it several times before. While it wasn't particularly life-threatening at the initial stages, he was going to be hard-pressed to be of any help when the Tusken arrived. As for Rith's comment, Radon couldn't believe how full of himself the Imperial was. He also noticed that the man had correctly identified him as a podracer even though Rith said he didn't remember much of anything beyond his own name. Radon was certain he hadn't introduced himself, unless he talked while he was unconscious. Despite his suspicions, he was in no condition to point it out, much less start an argument.
"What are Sand People?" he replied to Awne instead. "Let's just say they don't come to wrecks intending to rescue people."

Woroken begins looking for something that might give him some better vision. "Anyone have any electrobinoculars?" he wonders to himself. He did not remember seeing them on nay of his Red Team members. Maybe the tie fighter pilot had a pair. He begins his visual search of the crew and the remnants of the transport for them.

*Small bit of wookiee autopilot here.*
Radon lay back down, chuckling as he heard Awne's comment. He hadn't expected the mercenary to be the innocent one, not in the least. It gave him a breath of hope, somehow, to know that despite her background, Awne still had some measure of naivete in her.
"No, no," he said. "They're just people who live in the desert. That's why they're called Sand People. They're also called Tusken Raiders - yes, raiders."
From his prone position, Radon could clearly see Woroken move his head all around, as if he was looking for something. When the wookiee's eyes turned back to Radon, he asked, "What're you looking for, Woroken?"
The wookiee growled "Electrobinoculars", and put his hands over his eyes to mimic the gestures needed to use such a device, and slowly began moving his head left and right in a searching pattern. Though the gestures were more than enough to get the idea, Radon was surprised to realize he had understood the word by itself.
"Uh, Woroken's looking for electrobinoculars," he translated. "Anyone got a pair he could borrow?"

Radon finds it ironic that he and Ben, both natives, were the only ones visibly suffering from heat stroke. That wasn't the greatest surprise, however. What surprised him more was how Ben moved over to him and began asking the actor how he could contribute, despite the fact that the other youth was evidently much more capable than he was, having carried that drunken Toydarian and fighting those droids. When he remembered how Vor'en, veteran soldier that he was, asked Radon the same thing before they crashed, he had to wonder when their rag-tag team of thrill-seekers started considering him as the leader, when it was obvious that anyone else would've been more suited for the role. Radon: all 19 years young of him, with supermodel looks and a coward's heart - how could he possibly lead a group of people with more adventuring experience than he never wanted?
"You said you'd done some some repair work before? Help me see if we can still get the cockpit's comm systems working. I have the Falsoor Headmaster's frequency on my comm link - perhaps we can send him a distress call directly. If not, we should at least try to send a distress call. With any luck, we might've crashed near Mos Esre, close enough to be able to contact the Republic's occupation forces and get ourselves rescued."
Turning to the soldier, he said, "Vor'en, it's safe to assume those Sand People won't be too thrilled to see survivors. If you think our best option is to fight them off, I'll follow your lead. Right now, Ben and I aren't exactly in our best blaster-shooting form, though."
Radon takes a deep breath, fighting the illness that's overtaken him, moving over to the remains of the cockpit's controls. He sighs, "If only we had a working speeder..."

I want to know what that attack was about. They should be looking for us I assume, or at least for the ship wreckage." He begins tinkering with the comm link*Ben's mechanics is +7 -1 for conditions. He will take 10 or 20 if possible (don't have the rules with me so I don't know what is allowed at the moment.* When Radon starts talking about fighting Ben asks "Sand People? Coming here? If they get close let me know." Ben checks his Blaster to make sure it's still working and places it back on his belt. "Here Voren, you seem to be a compitent fighter. Have these," Ben hands Voren four frag grenades. "I don't want to have to fight the Tuskens, but if they try to swarm us these should be helpful.

Rith remembers the range of a long range comm and that the station is still intact. Also knowing that sand people will be carrying supplies Rith plans up a strategy. Heading over to the party Rith stands to the center. "Everyone the long range comm links can reach orbit, someone try to reach the station or anyone for that matter." "If any of you happen to have the frequency of the station or anyone on it try to reach them." "In the mean time the rest of us will set up an ambush for the sand people." "They do no know we are here so we have an advantage." "If the comm does not work then we will make our stand here and take what we need from them and make our move by night." "Everyone clear?!

Radon examines the communications relay interface and observes that the systems are damaged beyond repair. Time passes slowly as Red Team fights to endure the extreme conditions, and then night falls. You all seem desperate and can't quite figure a way out of here, and some of you don't know what local indigeneous life holds in store for you. The moonlight slowly trickles into the cockpit and it seems to get quieter outside as you hear the soft winds. After some more time, the moonlight seems especially bright.

Despite Rith's overly and increasingly arrogant behavior, Radon manages to ignore the man long enough to determine that they were, to use a local phrase, "in the sarlacc pits". All he could do was sit back on the seat and try to wrack his brains for a solution. It wasn't helping. The suns had set, and Radon was growing ever weary of all the ludicrous ideas he had been thinking up in order to survive. As he watched Ben pull out a datapad, an new idea came to him: maybe just a standard comm signal would work. He only had to consider how far away they were.
Radon pulled out his comlink and his audiorecorder. He recorded, "Mayday. Radon Antila speaking. Have crash-landed on Tatooine on the way to Mos Esre from Falsoor station. Requesting assistance." After that, he set the comlink onto an emergency frequency, and connected the recorder to it, setting the audiorecorder to repeat the message over and over. Finally, he set the device to beep if he had any incoming response.
He looked outside, and saw the brightest moonlight he'd seen in years. It somehow gave him a sense of peace and serenity, despite the temperature drop. Still, it was obvious that if they had any intention of getting anywhere, now would be the proper time to do it.
"I say we move. At least to somewhere we can get better desert gear. If those Sand People didn't come looking for us, maybe we can go looking for them, instead. I don't know about you guys, but I personally don't have a problem stealing if it gets me through another day."

Woroken, having never been to Tatooine before, was at a bit of a loss. If the party were to travel, it should obviously be soon. Travelling at night made the desert almost bearable. Radon, a native, thought this was a good idea. Also, the sand people that were no doubt closing in would definitely complicate matters.
However, leaving the crash site would make it more difficult to be found by a rescue ship, if one were coming. And it appeared no one knew the way the party should head out.
For the time being, the wookiee said nothing, content to have the others debate the issue more. Whatever the others decided, Woroken would support the decision. He just wished they would decide something, fast.

"I'm not so sure." Ben said, looking slightly uncomfortable. "Even if they assume everyone died in the crash, someone has to come to inspect the wreckage or something. I don't like the idea of just waiting here for days either, but cities on Tatooine are so spread out, it could be weeks before we made it to civilization, where as it makes sense that someone would come to us within the week if we stayed here." Ben gives Radon a shrug. "I don't like just waiting here either though. Does anyone think the Tie fighter is at all functioning in the bay? Even if the comm system was working we would be ahead of the game."

"His chose his own path," Woroken thought as he watched Rith walk away. The wookie wished him well, but certainly did not feel the need to go traipsing after him. However, since it appeared there was a good chance that the remainder of the team planned on staying here for a bit, Woroken decided some scouting nearby might be called for, especially if the sand people were indeed on the way.
Woroken pulls a glow rod, ignites it, and begins scouting around the camp for any places that might be more defensible, or to set a trap, if the situation called for it.

Vor'en and Rith set out into the moonlit desert in the direction of the last heard Tusken growls. They are determined to take some action, whether or not it is a good action remains to be seen.
At the cockpit, Bennosuke looks through his datapad but he cannot get the news through this device alone. Radon sets his comlink for an emergency signal, and hopes that someone will get in contact with him. Almost immediately after, the comlink starts beeping and someone answers.
Man: "Hello, this is Jedi Master Kel-Yun Lorhas on a mission for the Republic. We heard your distress call, please send us your coordinates at your leisure. We will make our way out there with a rescue team to search for any survivors. Keep all your people close together and stay hydrated."

Radon shakes his head as he watches Rith and Vor'en move out. After a few minutes of contemplation, he begins to stand up, dusting himself off, preparing to go with them, but by then they're beyond his sight. Nevertheless, his attention is grabbed by the beeping of his comlink. What he hears makes him feel as though a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He could almost jump.
*"A Jedi Master?!?!"* Radon exclaims in his head. Normally, he would be quite skeptical of anyone saying they were Jedi without seeing one of those fancy "lightsaber" things, especially one who claimed to be a Jedi Master, but considering their desperate circumstances, he was more than willing to take that chance. It also meant that rescue was close by, and that was another thing to be thankful for.
Grabbing his comlink as fast as most gunslingers would draw their blasters, he detached the audiorecorder, and eagerly replied, "Jedi Master, this is Radon Antila. We are in cockpit of crashed transport. All systems are down. Have no way to determine exact coordinates. Will keep comlink active for trace, and will have other survivors do same."
After transmitting, he told the others, quite happily, "Looks like we've got our first stroke of luck today. Well, second, if you count surviving the crash."

Radon listens to the comlink for his reply.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: Yes, definitely keep the comlink active. I would say use a flare or some sort of light so we can find you in the desert, but that would attract the Sand People. Just hold out as long as you can, we are dispatching landspeeders with rescue squads to search for you. I will advise you though, it might be difficult to find you... We are coming out of Mos Esre and the desert stretches on for miles. It might be hard to pinpoint your location.

Rith stops in his tracks at the sound of Radon. His idea had worked they had reached someone over the comm, something puzzled Rith at the moment though. If they had reached help why had no one contacted him or Voren. After all that had happened they act like they did not care then once he had left went along with his plan and left him out. Rith had helped save these people on several occasions and treated some of their injuries and yet no one cared about his life save for a Half cat girl. Rith decided that it was time that he made his point. He was going to make someone pay for all that had transpired. Looking to Voren Rith decided that they were heading back. "Voren we are moving out." "They got in contact with someone and left us out of the loop to die." "Someone will pay Voren, one way or another raiders or human, someone will die." At that Rith and Voren turned around and began the trek back at a hurried pace. Someone was going to pay.

Ben looks at comm link when he realizes that Radon has made contact. "A Jedi? Were saved!!! I told you it was a good idea to stay put." Ben dances up and down in elation for a second, pawing Radon and Woroken on the back. Then his elation dies, "The others, they shouldn't have gone out. We have to bring them back." Ben takes out his own comm link and tries to reach Voren, "We've made contact with a Jedi, they're gonna come to the ship to rescue us, forget the sand people and get back here. We'll hold off any Tuskens that attack the camp."

She frowns as she doesn't find anymore glow rods but passes half of the ones she has to the Wookiee "Alrright now what do we do with these?" She wraps her arms around herself, her tail around her waist as she bites back a shiver, she was starting to feel a little cold.

Rith and Vor'en arrive back at the cockpit after about eight minutes. As they approach the perimeter, they notice glow rods have been set up on each corner around the cockpit and they are easy to see from a good distance away.

Radon reacts, as he hears a blaster bolt hitting the metal of the ship. Instinctively, he drops his comlink and dives behind the cockpit's console for protection.

Ben had climbed on top of the ship to watch for sand people or swoop bike gangs that might cause trouble to the red team. When he sees Rith and Voren coming he starts to climb down the ship. By the time Rith pulls out his blaster, he is on the ground about six meters from the exit. His blaster carbine is already in hand, since he was on guard. *Initiative +8 HP 24-6=18*

To everyone who is not in the cockpit, it's a surprise round. Only people who are in the Cockpit can act this round, which would be Rith and Radon.

Since he has had to holster the pistol. *I don't know how long it will take to climb down, so my actions will be- finish climbing down, draw blaster and try to persuade Rith).* Ben looks at Rith horrified that the tie pilot is turning on his friend. "Rith, what are you doing? There's no point in this! Think about it, Radon wasn't planning on leaving you, we just got excited and forgot to comm you for a second." *Persuation +2 + my last force point!

*Wait, Rith's in the cockpit? I thought I read him as shooting from outside as soon as they came back to the wreck. Ah, well.
Surprise round:*
Radon hears the scream of Rith, turning just in time to see the man begin to draw his blaster. "What the...?!" Radon reacts, as a sudden rush of adrenaline fills him, along with the dread he always felt during these times. Instinctively, he drops his comlink and draws his blaster, as he had grown accustomed to whenever someone made an imminent threat to his life such as this and gave him no quarter.
Yes, the podracer was a coward - to the core, in fact - but there was one thing Rith needed to know about cowards, especially of those from Tatooine. They fight when their backs are to the wall, and they fight to survive. Nothing else matters to a cornered coward but his life, and he'll do everything to keep it. Everything.
*"Not today, Imperial,"* he thinks, then blurts out: "NOT TODAY!"
*Swift action to drop the comlink. Move action to draw blaster. Standard Action to fire at point-blank (+4 total). If the attack roll comes up short but within 6 of Rith's Reflex Def, use a Force Point. In case it hits without needing a Force Point, use a Force Point for the damage roll (3d6+1 base).

Just as Rith begins to draw his weapon, Radon quickly drops his comlink almost sensing the imminent attack. Instantly, Radon's pistol is pointed and fired at Rith before the TIE pilot can fire. The blaster bolt streaks through the cockpit and thumps Rith in shoulder, hitting his armor. Rith seems to stagger slightly at the pain.

Bennosuke looks down the side of the crashed cockpit after grabbing his blaster. The maroon hull had pieces of wrecked metal jutting out of it. He carefully put his feet down and scaled down the short distance and plopped down on the sand, flicking the switch of his blaster to stun. He could see Vor'en approaching the opening to the cockpit around the corner from where he was. Bennosuke could see no one else standing outside though.

*Vor'en, how closely did you follow Rith into the cockpit? Because I have it as he stepped inside the cockpit through a damage hole, so if you fired at him from outside, he would have a cover bonus to your ranged attack. It is your turn by the way.*

---

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-23 03:26:22)

*Vor'en, you followed right behind Rith and you can shoot him in the back cause you are adjacent to him. However, anyone else firing at the cockpit will only hit Vor'en because Rith is blocking the only ground-level entrance. Vor'en's allies can stand right next to him and engage Rith, but you cannot get through to the cockpit with Rith standing there. The hole in the cockpit is not that large and only one person at a time can fit through it, but Rith has his back at the entrance. Also, everyone keep track of their ammo count, if you haven't done so already. Vor'en's Ranged Attack 13+5=18.*
Vor'en, shocked that his ally just attempted to kill Radon, switches his weapon to stun and fires a bolt into Rith's back. The bolt just barely skims past the side of Rith's armor, unaffecting him.

The searing pain of the blaster bolt makes his scream, but soon enough the pain subsides, as nothing but sheer force of will keeps Radon going. No, he refuses to go down for any one!
"AN AMBUSH?!" he screams, and grits his teeth. As he tries his best to move in the cramped quarters of the cockpit, he takes aim as best as he can. He pulls the trigger once again.
"WHO'S THE REAL COWARD NOW?!"
*Swift action for Second Wind to regain 13HP (for total gain of +4 after the previous damage). Standard action to fire point-blank at +4, and using a Force Point. Damage should be 3d6+2. Forgot about the +1 additional PBS damage last turn.*

Maybe I missed something…no matter…I want to be as accurate as possible with the rules. It keeps the game going right. Radon's Attack Roll 20(Holy crap!)+1+4=25; Damage Dealt 26, Rith moves -1 on the condition track.* 
Rith and Radon square off evenly in the cockpit of the downed transport, each bolt fired by their weapons makes for a jolting sound. Every shot makes them flinch as they exchange blaster fire...hatred fills Rith as he attempts to gun Radon down. Then it happened, a blaster bolt squarely strikes Rith in the stomach and he kneels in pain...without armor he would have obviously died instantly. Rith felt his strength waning as he wasn't as confident anymore to take Radon down.

Woroken was still slightly confused by what was transpiring. Why was the tie fighter attacking Radon in full view of everyone? He had to be out of his mind, and was clearly suffering from the last round, and was on his knees. The wookiee moved aside Rith and Woroken decided to take the pistols from Rith. "No reaosn to kill anyone when they were helpless--it wasn't necessary," Woroken figured. "At the least, maybe people will stop shooting at each other."
*Don't know if that would be grapple or what. I am assuming by going to his knees, he is pretty much helpless. If not, I am going to grapple him, and try to grab the pistols anyway. Grapple +6*

After falling to his knees, Rith quickly gets back up and attempts to end the battle, his weapon sights aimed in on Radon. However, Woroken moves right behind Rith and reaches for one of his pistols. Rith sees the furry Wookiee arm reaching around him to grab the pistol, he shoves his shoulder into the Wookiee's arm. Woroken's arm is deflected and he can't reach the pistols.

At this point Rith had lost his reason his eyes red with hate He was no longer in control of himself. His anger was pulling him to a point he couldnt grasp or get out of. With a cry of fear and hate Rith fired again the pain and anger pushing aside any humanity left at this moment.

*Rith's Ranged Attack 18+6+1=25; Damage Dealt 18+4=22.*
Despite the Wookiee's attempt to disarm the TIE pilot, Rith aligns his pistol sights on Radon's head, and fires a mortal shot.
The blaster bolt strikes directly on the right side of Radon's face, piercing his cheek and exiting on the left side of his face. Skin, jaw bone, and blood spill out against the wall of the cockpit...Radon then slumps to the wall...and collapses. Radon appears to be dead. Rith, after viewing this sight, collapses from the overdrive of adrenaline and pain.

She rushes to his side turning him to face her crying out at the sight *'dear galaxy no..please..please no!! J…Jedi!!! Jedi can heal!! please please, galaxy please! Jedi Masterr We need help!!!'* She screams in her mind her emotions getting the better of her, her body thrumming from the surge from earlier sending her thoughts to the Jedi she had heard over the comlink, praying, begging that he might somehow hear her and come faster.
She looks up as she pulls Radon to her, wrapping her arms around him and craddling him in her lap. She points to Rith and growls to all in the room "No one touch him, guarrd him, but NO ONE TOUCH HIM...I'll deal with him laterr.." she sniffs and turns to the Wookiee "Worro can't you help him?? he can't die.." she turns to the human in her arms "You can't die! you prromised me a drrink!!"

He is determined to leave nothing that might be used against the party in the possession of the murderer. Woroken points to Vor'en to stand guard on Rith.
After collecting the materials from Rith, the wookie manuevers over to Awne. Despite being a decent battle medic, he never quite figured out comforting in times of tragedy, Woroken pats the Farghul compassionately on the shoulder. No healing could help Radon now, Woroken knew.

"If there is any hope for saving Radon, it is through Woroken right now. There isn't anything you can do now, except let Woroken try to help him."

She lifts the unconcious man to lay against her, her arms wrapped his waist, it was a good way for her to make sure he was ok and that when he woke he wouldn't be able to hurt anyway. "Rrith..why?" she whispers not expecting him to respond yet.

Awne remembered back to her Teras Kasi training days, those days of deep meditation. She remembered that she could mysteriously communicate with her father during these sessions. For some reason, it seemed to be the right thing to do with the Jedi Master. She searched her feelings, closed her eyes, and spoke softly. "Help...", were the words she uttered. After this, a single thought entered her mind...."On the way.". It was strange indeed, but it seemed the more time progressed, the more Awne was tapping into a weird power that her father told her about years ago.

Awne sighs and opens her eyes, wrapping her arms tighter around the human in her arms as she speaks to the others in the room "Help's coming..Worro is Rradon ok?" Now calmer and knowing that help was coming soon she had lost the anger she had felt to Rith for trying to kill Radon, true he wasn't in the clear yet, but atleast now she wouldn't be using claws in her 'talk' with him later. She gently checks for any weapons that may have been missed, removing any she may have found.

Woroken breaks open his medpac and kneels next Radon. He applies bacta to the open wound on both sides of his face. Woroken continues to work even though the sight of being able to see Radon's skull, muscle, and blood makes his stomach turn. It was unreal, to see someone of such a clean appearance to be reduced to this state, life was so fragile. After the bacta was applied, Woroken sprinkled on synflesh to seal the wounds. Next, Woroken wrapped bandages around the damaged part to both of Radon's cheeks. Finally, Woroken administered an injection into Radon's thigh to make the pain subside. Radon had gone completely numb.
*Radon is now at 1 hp, he is still -5 on the condition track but he is conscious and can be moved around with assistance. Woroken judges that he will need surgery or a bacta tank to be back to normal.*

Ben leans over the recovering Radon, "How you feeling pretty boy?" Ben tries his best to give his companion a comforting smile. "You got to rest up okay. There are jedi coming and everything is going to be alright so just sit tight."
After making sure that Radon is alright Ben goes to the ship's computer. I wonder if there's anything I can fix... shaken by the events that have transpired, Ben needs to do something with his hands to calm him down... maybe get some shields running or the comm system. If I can get anything operational on this ship, even just one cabin to lock Rith in that would be great. *Mechanics +7* Plus there's got to be enough raw parts on this ship to make a few droids out of so it shouldn't be too hard.

Now that he had a second to consider what had transpired over the last few seconds, the wookiee recalled Awne saying that help was on the way. That was good, as Radon probably shouldn't be moved for the immediate time being. Maybe the Jedi's ship had more advanced healing, like a bacta tank. While Woroken had performed a few surgeries in the past, he would really prefer to not take the risk of leaving the handsome young holovid star with scars. "Females galaxy wide would hold a grudge," he snorted to himself, happy in the recent developments...

Woroken was well pleased with the developments. A chance to rest and recover for a bit would be great. However, he had to admit his feelings were a little stung for a brief moment--he considered himself a medic, maybe not a great one, but one after all. He grunted unpleasantly in Awne's general direction, as a reminder there was already a medic here. His grumpy mood only lasted a second as he grudgingly admitted she did have a point though. Medical **supplies**, like a medkit at the least were definitely needed if he were to keep attempting to patch up Red Team. He planned on asking the team to contribute to one of the pricey kits at the earliest convenience.
He stood up and took up guard duty on Rith, as Radon appeared to be okay, especially with help right around the corner, "I hope I get to meet a Jedi knight," the young wookiee thought as he waited for the recovery party.
His thoughts changed when he heard the sounds of battle in the distance. Someone needed to watch out for Radon, and to guard Rith, but the rest of Red Team needed to head out to meet the Tuskans.****

The Tuskens spot members of Red Team and charge at them, showing no concern for their lives with a mad dash attack.
One of the Tuskens swings at Bennosuke with a gaffi stick, when all of a sudden a landspeeder pulls right next to the cockpit. The shadows conceal the complete figure of the person. The tuskens stop their attack and just look at the speeder, in complete shock.
The figure in the vehicle takes this moment of surprise and somersaults over the stunned tuskens. While the figure is in the air, a brilliant blue blade ignites and slices off the head of one attacker. The other three converge on the person as the figure lands. Before a single blow can be struck, the person outstretches their arms and the three tuskens are blown back violently. The person holds their arm out and mystically guides the spinning lightsaber into each prone Tusken in the sand. After they are defeated, the lightsaber neatly floats onto a hook of the person's belt. The person looks to the cockpit and takes their hood off.
You see a strikingly beautiful young woman with brownish/red hair that is long and to her shoulders. She has dark brown eyes and a white face, like clean ivory. Her uniform is a brown tunic with black trim, with a brown Jedi robe on the outside of her form. The woman's pants are tucked neatly into her boots and she is wearing black gloves that seem to have a few tears in them. She holds her hands up and looks around at the cockpit.

Strangely, now that Woroken was now in the presence of a real Jedi, he became very uncomfortable. He was not one for feeling nervous, but that seemed to describe the exact feelings he had.
Without really looking the Jedi in the eye, the wookiee asked her if she understood Shriwook. If so, he would attempt to explain the Rith situation, including all the details about the attack on Radon.

"He's the reason we have injuries." Ben says with a scowl. Ben is increadibly excited to meet a real jedi. His brother had told him stories about their abilities to move things with their mind and hurt an opponent from far away. Shocked by her rough beauty, Ben barely manages to look at her as he introduces himself. "My name is Bennosuke, but you can call me Ben. Thank you for coming to rescue us." Ben tries to hide his smile, and prays that he isn't blushing. He fastens his blaster back on his belt. "So what now?"

Rith pulls back into thought after hearing Awne's words. Was he an Imperial? He cursed his mind for having lost so much of himself, he tried to remember why he had this suit. If he was an Imperial Pilot why had he been on the ship while The other pilots were attacking. Very little made sense to him at this point, but he hoped that in time that would change. Hearing Ben's remark Rith turns to him. "I am the reason for Radon's injuries Ben, not yours, or anyone elses for that matter." "So do not push me, I can easily be responsible for yours as well, and I Promise you will not be so lucky as Radon." Rith looks to Awne at his side then back to this Jedi. "I have a question for you Jedi." "I remember small hearings of Jedi reading minds, can you read mine and perhaps help me understand why I am here?"

If they were going to be around eachother and working for the greater good then dammit it all they needed to be atleast civil! She growls softly showing her displeasure at how they were treating eachother her tail puffing slightly.
She looks quizically at Rith at his words "Jedi rread minds?" she looks in the thought as she address the Jedi "Wherre's Misterr Lorrhas? is he alrright? I'd like to ask him about something he mentioned to me."

Jes Mur Eva: "We will have time to talk at the med station, get your wounded people ready to move. We'll be happy to answer any questions you have there."
Mur Eva picks up her comlink again.
Mur Eva: "Master, we are ready. Please pull right in next to the cockpit."
After a few seconds you hear numerous landspeeders outside of the cockpit.
Mur Eva: "Ok, grab your first wounded man and follow me..."
Mur Eva looks at you and runs out into the windy area around the landspeeders.

As Woro and Awne walk outside, you see another young Jedi male with blonde hair guiding Woro to a certain landspeeder with just one Republic trooper driving it.
Jedi: "Careful you don't hit his head! Let me have a look at him."
The Jedi helps Woro ease Radon into the back of the landspeeder. He then gets in the landspeeder with Radon and motions for Woroken to go to another landspeeder.
Awne and Mur Eva go to another landspeeder and put Rith in it. Like the other landspeeder, this just has one person in it.
Jes Mur Eva: "If you don't mind, I'll ride with him and watch out for him."
Mur Eva hops in the landspeeder and puts her hand on his forehead.
Overall, you notice there are five landspeeders total, and some Republic troops have gotten out in a defensive posture to make sure everything gets loaded without being attacked.

Awne frowns slightly, not liking the idea of no one from Red Team being with the imperial. After all, he WAS an imperial and these WERE the Republic, what if they tried to kill him? Her tail flicks quickly in displeasure as she address the Jedi, for now at least she'd have to cooperate, that didn't mean she couldn't set rules; "Alrright, No offence ment miss Jedi, I'm not too knowledgeable about yourr type but seeing as he's in an Imperrial uniforrm and you'rre with the republic I have my doubts, so please forrgive me if it's common knowledge to all that you Jedi types arre trrustworrthy but he had betterr show up in one peice, brreathing, and eitherr in a betterr condition orr as he is now orr I'll be holding you perrsonally rresponsible." She tugs on her fingerless gloves slightly as she finishes. "That goes forr the rrest of this pack too of courrse." she smiles sweetly and pats Rith on the shoulder "You behave now." She says and walks off to another speeder hopping into it easily and smiling pleasently at the driver.

Ben, overhearing Awne and the Jedi's conversation, moves over to the landspeeder, and takes a seat. There has been a question confusing him for some time now and he decides to ask it. "If you don't mind me prying, why are there so many Jedi involved in this mission. I mean its just a reconnosance mission right, its not like we are all a threat or anything." Things aren't adding up. Why were they being so friendly to Rith. Wouldn't it be common knowladge that the transport had been downed by Remnant Tie fighters, so wouldn't the Tie pilot be arrested automatically. Things just weren't adding up.

Master Lorhas watches as the rest of Red Team gets into the landspeeder. He then adds power to the thrusters and the small convoy begins moving through the desert. The wind and sand rips through your hair as you move along speeds of a hundred miles per hour or more. Master Lorhas talks to Bennosuke as he is driving.
Master Lorhas: "My friend, the Jedi are protectors of all innnocent people in the galaxy, so helping you does not exceed our responsibilities. We heard of a crashed shipped in this desert so I wished to help the Republic Unit here search for survivors."
*You can make a perception check here.*
He then speaks in Awne's direction.
Master Lorhas: "As for your question, that was indeed me who contacted you through the Force. But I am curious, how did you learn to use the Force?"
Meanwhile, in Mur Eva's speeder, she speaks to Rith.
Jes Mur Eva: "Yes, I am sitting here to watch you. My main concern is to make sure you are safe, but after that, you will be taken under custody of the Republic Expeditionary force for questioning. Don't worry about any of that now, just rest."
Mur Eva seems to have a calming presence with her beauty sitting right next to you. Rith doesn't know whether to reject this or accept it though.

Woroken sat quietly in the back of the speeder. He was fascinated by the Jedis--especially the female with the lightsaber and the amazing fighting ability. Once they got to a safer ground, he had several questions to ask the Jedis, but he saw no reason to bother any of them with his queries at the current time. He wondered where they were going, and whether he could get a drink and some sleep there...

Kel-Yun: "How innocent you seem, you wield the power of the Force but you do not know its name? I imagine to something as powerful as the Force a mere title can seem irrelevant. Well, what we call the Force, is a mystical energy field that resides in every living thing. It IS life, some beings are blessed enough to be able to listen to the Force. And yes, the Force can think and feel just like any other type of being. You need simply to know that it surrounds you and that it is everywhere, and I believe we are given the ability to be able to control this energy field to help the Force make ends meet. The Force has given us all destinies and we live to fufill these destinies for a larger picture that we may never understand."

Ben listens intently to the Jedi's explanation. He had never seen or heard of anything like this, but the Jedi's words plus his brother's stories ignite Ben's imagination. Thoughts of a dominating life force fill his mind and he wonders how true the concept is. Then Ben lets his imagination run wild, what if it was him rather than Awne who could feel this Force? Would he become a jedi, wielding a lightsaber and conquering evil around the galaxy? What would his future hold?
What did his future hold now... "Thank you for saving us." Ben says happly, letting the wind brush through his short hair and tickle his face. "Where are we going now? And how long will it take to get there?" This brings Ben to thoughts about his past, about the death of his father and his brother, and the swoop gang who forced him off this planet. Wow was Ben's mind wandering, he must be getting tired. It had been such a long adventure. His previous life on this planet already felt unreal. And here he was back on Tatoonie.

Awne ponders what she was told, A life force inside her? odd. More questions come to mind, what happened back on the station, all the emotions she felt was that the Force? why did it happen? she almost passed out from it! wasn't it a good thing? she moved those plates off her without touching them was that the force? but if it was alive in her then how did it move? and what was that aura around the wookiee she felt?
She shakes her head, these questions in her mind were making her head hurt. She puts her head in her hands and groans, no.. wait that was real pain *'Starrs I forrgot the pain frrom earrlierr.'* She winces, seems that now that all the commotion and needing to survive had calmed down for the time being her body had decided now was the perfect time to remind her of the trauma it went through. Though she hurt she needed answers "I have many questions Misterr Lorrhas and I think you may be the only one who can answerr them..well..besides the Lady Jedi up therre but I'd rratherr not ask herr" she growls the last bit out, she still didn't like that woman, she wasn't sure why yet, she just didn't like her.

Radon didn't even feel the last bolt that punctured his cheek. All he felt was the sudden rush of blood from his face, then nothing. His eyes fixated forward, seeing only that he had lost his footing and tumbled onto the cold metal surface of the cockpit before finally blacking out.
Still, in the darkness of his mind, Radon was alive. It was as if his will to live superceded any destined death that would've come to other men. Not Radon. In his mind, he reached out into the darkness, and with a wave of his mentally-conjured arm, tore the shadows asunder. From then, the serene beauty of Tatooine's moonlight penetrated his eyelids. He had not the strength to open his eyes, but he could surely feel the lightness of his being. Other than that fleeting sensation, one he hadn't experienced in forever, Radon could feel nothing - not his arms, not his legs, not even the smallest twitches of his fingers.
Despite all of this, he did not mind. As his bodied was taken through a speeder ride, a single tear fell from his still-closed eye.
He was alive. That was all that mattered.
Unable to speak, move or simply just awaken, Radon, barely breathing as he was, decided to rest. He left his fate into hands of the others, but only because he had no choice. In this rest, he mimicked death, but death had not yet found him.

"I will not just be thrown into some prison though." At that Rith leans back in his seat again and closes his eyes hoping to finally get some rest. The past events had been infuriating, and tiring, and he needed sleep.

You are just outside the city by at least one hundred meters. Kel-Yun speaks back to Vor'en's conversation.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "You are very right about the lack of evidence. However, the Remnant fighters are the one responsible for shooting down the ship. He may not be guilty, but more than likely he is linked. We will get to the bottom of this, and if he is innocent...he will be set free immediately. While I want to set things right with this sabotage, I'm afraid it is not our mission. The Republic forces here will decide your friend's fate. They might not even really be concerned with your friend's fate either. We are all undergoing a very pressing matter at the moment."
You can notice that Lorhas has become visibly concerned.
Lorhas: "I can also not just let this slide by if your friend is truly innocent. Could you try giving me any evidence? The Republic will probably tend to favor my words over a stranger."
The speeders are now entering the city. You slowly hover underneath a large tan archway, with Republic guards flanking each side. They are clad in crimson and black light armor. The guards render a salute to the Jedi Master's speeder as you enter. To all the local Tatooine party members, this is an unlikely sight to see. You never thought the Republic would have a show of force here.
The speeders slow down considerably as you enter the settlement of Mos Esre. The pathways between each building is just sand to traverse. There are many buildings here that are very close together, and it makes the speeders twist and turn looking for their destination. The buildings themselves average about 15-25 feet high. They seem to be of a very abode-style design, and most of them are made of brown/tan plasteel or duracrete, most of them either have flat roofs or dome roofs. These buildings seem very archaic, however you still see signs of advanced technology speckled among the settlement. Some of the houses are still light up in their interiors, but the streets seem deserted. You estimate that most people are asleep. The only real activity is the starships coming and going from the port.
The speeder arrives at the Med station shortly. It is a rectangular style building with a low roof. It is a grayish color and it seems to be marked as a medical place. After a few seconds, people clad in white uniforms rush out of the doorway and start looking for injured people. Lorhas looks to the group.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Let them get the wounded off first, then we will sort everything out."

Rith still tired and barely awake steps out of the speeder, his injuries still had not fully healed but he was much better off than radon, and that thought made him smile slightly. As the medical personel help him into one of the many medical capsules Rith closes his eyes once more to try and rest. Hopefully his wounds, not as serious as Radon's would heal soon. He closes his eyes utterly exhausted once again and falls to sleep.

Awne rubs her head briefly wondering if she should have it looked at but disregards the thought. She watchs the people the more importantly she watchs for anyone going too close to Radon and Rith that weren't in white uniforms of medics. She directs her words to the Jedi though she doesn't look at him, "He told us his name is Rrith Bendarr, frrom Corruscant...therre...therre was a moment on the ship when he had fallen to his knees, he seemed to be in pain if holding his head was anything to go by. When Worro therre" she points to the wookiee only taking her eyes off the two wounded men for a moment before returning "Worro moved to help him up and Rrith snapped at him, he said that it was people like him that she died..I dunno who she is, but whoeverr she is he rrememberrs herr."
She thinks of anything else that happened back on the ship "He has rreally long silverr hairr..rreally nice..and these amazing blood rred eyes..I've neverr seen a human with rred eyes beforre.." She trails off slightly and turns quickly to the Jedi "Will he be alrright with those medics? Wherre's the people to talk to? I don't want to leave him alone." She looks about ready to jump out of the speeder to rush to her human packmates side.

Woroken had no idea if the Jedi could understand him, but he felt that he had to be straightforward with him. "If these are medical personnel only, there should be someone experienced to guard the tie fighter as well. He has proven to be dangerous and attempted to murder the other human for no apparent reason. He has to be watched, to be sure no one else is injured."

Ben listens to the conversation with much interest. However it seems to him that Rith probably did have a part in sabatoging the ship. Why was Awne being so protective of RIth? He seemed to be dangerous and hated everyone in the Red Team except maybe Awne. Was it a girl thing? "Actually there is a lot of evidence that Rith might have done it." Ben says awaiting Awne's smile. "All the pilot's in the control room had been shot, and we saw images of a Tie Fighter in the hanger bay. Unless the real Tie Pilot framed Rith, which makes no sense, because they were expecting to kill everyone, and because the real Tie Pilot never have escaped. The Tie fighter was still there." Ben thinks about it for a second, and decides that he does not want to be the one condeming Rith though. "However, he claims to have no memory of any of this. If he has really forgoten who he is, it wouldn't make any sense to punish him. Actually, I've never really liked the idea of punishment anyways, but that's aside from the point. If we want to save Rith" Ben says to Awne, tyring to justify what he has said, " we might as well try to work with the truth. Or the truth that the jury trying Rith will see."

The blonde haired male Jedi moves with two medics and assists to move Radon into a medical capsule. Once he is in the capsule, they hover him into the medical station. As the door slides closed behind them, it reopens and you see two armed Republic guards with one unarmed Republic officer. They walk out and begin looking around. The officer points at Rith and the guards nod. The guards follow Rith's medical capsule into the facility. The officer walks up to Lorhas and they begin having a conversation. You notice the speeders turn off and all the sand stops blowing around. It suddenly becomes very peaceful.
Mur Eva approaches Red Team and talks to them.
Jes Mur Eva: "My master sent me to tend to you until you are ready to go out on your own. If you want beds and food, please follow me. Unless you'd like to be seen by a doctor? Also, if you have any evidence to help your friend, let's discuss it over a warm meal."
Mur Eva bows courteously and motions for you to follow her.

Woroken, while dinged a bit from his fall from the ladder this morning, did not need medical attention. A warm meal and a cold drink sounded like maybe the greatest thing in the world to the wookie at this point in time. He followed Mur Eva as well.

Awne jumps out of the speeder and nods her head to the woman slightly, her long tail flicking on the floor at her heels. She turns to Ben and frowns a little "Ben I know you don't like Rrith, but please, would you and Worro tell the woman everrthying that was mentioned in the speederr on the way herre?" She smiles at the wookiee then turns back to the woman "Please excuse me, I'd like to go and make surre Rrith is alrright, and wait until Rraden is out of wherreverr they take him." She rubs her eyes slightly as she speaks then takes off at a run to the doors to make sure they didn't try to take Rith away from them.

Awne runs into the medical facility. She notices the place has a very sterile look and smell to it. The floors are polished white, while the walls are of a gray color. There are medical platforms set up throughout the room with bodies laying on them. It seems the medics are doing light work on the bodies. However, there is a large group of people assisting to get Radon immersed in a bacta tank in the center of the room. They are removing his clothing at the moment. After scanning the large room for a bit, she spots that Rith has been put on a medical platform with various devices plugged into his body. The two Republic guards are standing right over him. She also notices a medical droid tending to him.

Awne glances at Radon, she sees that he seems to be in good hands and silently promises that she'll check on him again later. She moves to Rith quietly, pulling the two guards so they weren't hovering over him "It's not polite norr necessarry to hoverr while a doctorr orr nurrse is attending to a patient." She moves forward when the two guards are a little bit away and lays a hand on Rith's hand. She smiles then turns to the droid "How arre his wounds?" she asks gently, making her voice more calm for the benefit of the two guards and Rith.

One of the guards motions to Awne.
Guard: "I'm sorry, but we have given strict orders to watch over him. He could be behind the destruction of the Telares transport. Please keep your distance from him."
The droid swivels on it's torso to Awne. It motions with its scaple-arm aperture.
Droid: "He is in fine condition. He seems to be exhausted and dehydrated. We are administering some fluids into him intravenously. In about one hour he should be fine."

### **zerah** (2007-11-27 22:20:48)

Awne ignored the guard for the moment and smiles to the droid "Thank you forr yourr wonderrful experrtise." She turns now to the guard that spoke to her biting back a growl, she was getting cranky and her mood wasn't being helped by these men, she did try to keep in mind they were just doing their job. Her tail flicks and wraps around Rith's ankle gently as she address the men "I have been with him since we found him on the ship, Therre is a lack of evidence that he was involved and until evidence is found he is still an honorrarry memberr of my pack. He's not going to hurrt me, so how about you let us have a nice chat in prrivate hm?"

Rith looks at Awne, her hand on his shoulder. He stares at her for a brief moment then tries to recall anything, anything he can. Suddenly a vision, a memory rushes through his mind as if it were happening at that moment. Rith remembers running across the loading ramp heading to his tie fighter. He could not remember why or when. This was all he could see, was it true. The armour, the training. Could he be an imperial pilot, though it seemed possible it could have easily just been some dream. Something conjured up in his subconcious, but all denial aside everything was starting to stack up. And it was not stacking in Rith's favor. Rith turned back to Awne. "Just a vision, that is it." "I remember running to a Tie Fighter but that is it." "Listen Awne this is my fight, my destiny, do not get yourself caught up in a fate that i can not even recall." Rith stares into the Farghul's eyes deeply making sure his point had gotten across. "Do you understand me?"

Awne smiles gently and rests her hand on his cheek gently, looking back into his eyes, "I'm not going to just sit back and let them take you away Rrith." She filed away for later the vision he had, yes it this bit didn't look good, but..what if he had defected..that would give reason as to why the other TIE fighters had been shooting at the ship with a fellow still inside.

Guard: "We are not taking him away yet Miss. We must make sure he is fully able to plead his case. So we are tending to his health. After that, he will be taken under further custody. If you want to visit him, come back in the morning."
You notice that Master Lorhas arrives next you. He folds his arms and speaks like a wise old man.
Lorhas: "Is there a problem?"
Guard: "No Master Jedi. We are just making sure this person understands that this pilot cannot be removed from our care."

"he rrememberred something Misterr Lorrhas..it..it may not look good but I can theorize, there's still things that don't add up...If he was parrt of the destrruction, then why werre the otherr two TIE fighterr still shooting at us. Wouldn't they have come looking forr theirr own memberr? why would they leave him to die? Only plausible answerr I can think of is perrhaps he defected.." She speaks without looking to anyone but Rith.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-28 00:00:50)

Lorhas: "This has just become much more complicated. There is no real evidence proving him innocent or guilty. Minus the fact that he is more than likely affiliated with the Imperials. But you do bring up a good point my furry friend, why in the Force would he be on the ship while the other TIE's are bombarding the ship? What condition was he in when you found him? He cannot remember anything, and I can sense he is telling the truth through the Force. I don't think my ability with the Force has faded that much through the ages."
The guards seem a little puzzled.
Guard: "Well Master Jedi, we just have our orders. Though we'd like truth to show it's face. We will do what it is necessary."
Master Lorhas nods at the guards.
Lorhas: "Nevertheless, we are being sidetracked from our mission. However, something feels right in helping these survivors."

"I don't know much about this Forrce you say I have, but I do know to trrust my feelings when I feel like I can trrust someone, and I trrust him.

After a few minutes of this tense scrutiny she relaxs and nods "Alrright..I don't like this, but alrright." She turns back to Rith and steps closer to him her hand returning to his cheek "I'll be back in the morrning Rrith, please..be good tonight?"

Mur Eva: "I trust you handled everything in there? If you are ready, let's go."
The young Jedi lady walks forward leading Red Team. She takes a right into a dusty alley way. You walk about a hundred and twenty meters to a moderately large dome-top building. You walk into a low-lit room that appears to be a cantina and restaurant. The establishment is sparcely populated, and you see a tired middle-aged human cleaning the bar at the moment. He looks scruffy and dirty, with grease stains on his long-sleeved white shirt. Mur Eva spots a large table in the center of the room and ushers everyone to have a seat.
Jes Mur Eva: "The food is on me...everyone order at your leisure. The lodging is also on me. The rooms are on the second floor of this building. "
Mur Eva sits down and adjusts her robe to sit comfortably.

Awne looks around while she waits for the food. The soup arrives and she looks at it for a moment, before poking a peice of meat with her spoon. She glances up at the others to see them eatting the soup happily. Awne coughs a little and subtly eats around the meat, she had never been one to eat a lot of meat, strange for a farghul but her father had never eatten a lot of it so she never developed a taste for it, she was happy with a bowl of vegetable soup but she'd drink the broth. She wasn't very hungry, worrying over Rith and Radon was taking her hunger away, she would have gone straight to bed but thought it polite to atleast stay awhile with her pack.
Awne glances up from her broth to look at the Jedi "We came forr an interresting job forr bounty hunterrs, merrcenarries and anyone else that wants some crredits forr hunting." She grins she had forgotten why they were coming to the planet in the first place, but credits..that's right, she could do a lot with more money.

But we are not trying to determine how the ship was attacked or why. My master wants to ask you all some very specific questions later after you have all rested. So, I have to watch over you all and make sure you stay near me. I apologize for this apparent choke on your freedoms, but it is necessary...we are on a very important mission. My feelings tell me that these events are all linked, and you may be spending more time with us than you want. But I just ask you for your kind cooperation. And..."
Mur Eva pauses for a moment.
Mur Eva: "My Master truly sees something in your TIE pilot friend. I don't know what it is, but I have never seen him act so concerned about an individual before. He doesn't know where to start with him, and that is very strange. He may not have told you this, but he is at the facility right now to make sure your friend is not taken away. I think he has something planned for your friend but I don't know what. In my opinion, though I want to help my master, we shouldn't be spending a whole lot of time with this Imperial.

Awne walks up the stairs and just as she does, she sees a trandoshan clad in mercenary type black armor with red trim walk past her. He doesn't say a word and just leaves the restauraunt. Awne sees plasteel doors on each side of the small hallway. She picks the first room on her right and goes in, the door slides open. The first thing Awne notices is that the room is a cool temperature, and it feels very refreshing. There are two beds in the room that are neatly made. There also seems to be a refresher room to her right. She also notices is a mirror in the center left portion of the room, it is held up by a large table with drawers. To the right of that, is a opening that would be considered a window, except there is no glass in it. You can look out here to see the moonlight blanketing the quiet town.

Awne sighs and moves to the refresher room to clean up. Once finished she sighs in relief glad to feel clean again. She walks back into the room and looks out the 'window' for a moment hoping Rith and Radon were alright. She made a mental note to be more civil to the female jedi and appologise for her behavior, and to thank mister Lorhas later. She picks the bed closest to the wall and lays down under the covers, curling up and falling asleep in only a few minutes, her dreams revolving around a certain imperial.

Woroken, still sitting at the table, decides that Awne's uneaten stew should not go to waste, so he dumps it in his bowl, and finished both his and Awne's dinner. Woroken had no idea if the Jedi spoke shri wook, but he made an attempt at conversation, "I am sorry for the behavior of the Farghul. She has a strange interest in the tie fighter. She hears no bad about him, even though there seems to be evidence he could have been involved in the sabatoge, and he definitely shot a member of our group for no reason, and nearly killed him. I am certainly not convinced of his innocence or trustworthiness."

Dexer lets out a short sigh and leans back in his chair. "You going to order something, *SIR*?" Dexer turns slightly to look at the waitress currently making herself a nuisance. "My dear how can you expect me to choose from your establishment's wondrous selection of Tatooine delicacies with but a moment's thought?". The waitress just stares coldly in return."You said that an hour ago, and an hour before that. Have you even looked at the menu?" "Of course my dear, just a few minutes more and I will be ready." He taps the glass sitting next to him, "In the mean time might I have another of these." The waitress merely grunts and grabs up Dexer's empty glass.
With the distraction gone, Dexer turned his attention to the other patrons. Finding little of interest he turned his attention to the menu, planning on eating a returning to bed for the night, until the jedi arrived. Dexer had seen the small group of jedi before, indeed he had made it something of a point to know where they were most of the time, but the group with her was unusual. He focused his attention on them, as discretely as possible, and waited intently. His interest perked even more when an apparent disagreement arouse between the jedi and a strange cat-like alien, and he strained to hear the words exchanged between the two.

"You said there was another reason you were here aside from investigating the crash? Care to fill us in and maybe we can help with that problem. I owe you at least one favor, if not many more for rescuing us. Jedis are spoken of very highly on my planet, and it would be an honor to assist you..."

"Sir are you ready to order now?" Dexer glances up at the waitress and waves his hand dismissively, "Just bring me the bill. I'll be heading out now." Dexer smiled slightly as he mulled over this new information, 'So the bunch are survivors of the crash reported earlier, but how does that involve jedi?' His smile briefly turns to a scowl, 'Of course those self-righteous would be heroes must have leaped at the chance to save someone; more importantly why is a TIE pilot involved. This night certainly has gotten more interesting'
Dexer quietly pays his tab and starts towards the stairs. 'Looks like I'll be making the rounds tomorrow.'

Mur Eva looks at Woroken innocently.

Awne cracks an eye open, having just turned in her sleep cycle to a more concious state. She's not particularly worried, after everything the team had been through she was familier with their scents..that and she recognised the voice. Her tail flicks gently under the covers, moving to lay across her hip and trail down the side of the bed to the floor. She yawns "Night Vorr, Pleasent Drreams." She snuggles back into the pillow and purrs softly as she slips back into dreamland.

Woroken decided to briefly continue the conversation with the Jedi. "I need to go to get some rest myself, and don't want to put you out, but I do look forward to speaking with your master. I heard some of his discussions of the Force with some of the other members of Red Team, and I have a few questions as well. Do you know if he speaks Shriwook?
Also, on a different topic, those moves you used against the Sand people were amazing. I have heard about lightsabers before, but seeing one in action was really impressive. You are very skilled in battle."

Ben eats his meal in silence. The food is very good, but his senses have been getting numb. The conversation seems to go by over his head, and he says very little. Finally after he has finished his fourth glass of Jawa Juice and his third bowl of food. He stands up and excuses himself. "It was very nice meeting you," he says to Mura Eva. I hope to have the chance to get to know you better, tomorrow." He smiles and nods his head, and says to Woroken, "Good night buddy. When I wake up, which might be never, I would like to continue the Shyriiwook lessons tomorrow. Good night."

Mur Eva waves goodbye to Bennosuke as she is finishing her soup. After she wipes her mouth with a napkin she speaks to Woroken.
Mur Eva: "My master certainly does speak Shyriiwook, as Jedi we often study many languages. We are usually called forth to mediate between many different races, this is when we assume a more ambassador like role. But, as far as my fighting prowess goes, I'm afraid that is quite average for a Jedi. You see, with The Force, any task can be done much better than someone without the Force. Because we listen to The Force and let it guide us, it is empowering us by following its will."

It has only happened a few times, but I have always tried to follow my "calling". Heck, following it is what put me here today. I had no experience with hunting, but for some reason, I just...had.... to go to that space station, which led directly to this.

And it would seem many among you have a very strong potential relationship with the Force, that has definitely not eluded the eye of my master. Your group of people has brought fourth many questions to my master and us. We have so much to do and so little time.

"Good night, Mur Eva," he bade the Jedi, and followed her to the hallway, looking for an empty room. Finding one, he goes to bed, and falls quickly to sleep.

About nine hours and twelve minutes pass when Awne awakes to the sound of a beeping comlink.
*You all regain hit points equal to your level.*
Her eyes barely opening, she can see sunlight pouring in from the window. It is very bright, and blinding to her focusing eyes. She sees Vor'en asleep next to her, completely undisturbed by the beeping comlink. She did not want to get up, as she felt she had a lot of sleep to catch up on, but thoughts of her companion Rith inspired her to stay awake.

She ends the call and pockets the comlink, moving back to her room and speaking loudly from the door, she wouldn't be surprised if the soldier had a gun under the pillow so better to be safe "Vorr! time to get up we need to get to the med centerr!"

Red Team reluctantly gets out of bed and assembles in the hallway. They all check their equipment preparing to head to the Med station. Once they are ready, they descend down the steps. The first impression they get is that the Bantha Track's bar is now flooded with people, conversations are loud and ambient. However, a majority of the people are rough looking, with the occasional Republic soldier throughout the crowd. The soldiers are in twos or threes. No one pays any notice to Red Team coming down the steps.

She gets out of the door while being nearly tripped. Awne regains her footing and stands tall, she notices the suns are not in high noon just yet, but at least two hours away.
The streets of Mos Esre are quite populated, although not quite shoulder to shoulder. Just as Awne is looking around, Mur Eva comes behind Awne and greets her.

He had a small bruise from his falling off the ladder into Awne, but nothing serious. "Must be more graceful in the future there, Woro," he thought, pleased that his slip did not cost the Red Team.

Red Team works their way through the crowded streets of Mos Esre. You see large clumps of people, creatures, and landspeeders going about their business. After a short walk, you are back to the Med facility. When you walk in, you can see Radon sitting in the far corner. His face seems back the way it was, the medics had done very good work. Radon was in patient clothing. Rith was at the other end of the facility, in patient clothing as well. The Republic guards were keeping a close eye on him. All of the bodies that you saw last night are no longer there.
*Rith and Radon are back to full hp and are normal on the condition track.*
Jedi Master Lorhas approaches the group and bows politely. After he bows, another Jedi comes to his side.
Lorhas: "Hello, this is my other apprentice, Feldon Azrik."
Feldon is wearing a tan Jedi tunic with dark brown robes on the outside. He had blonde short hair with a clean smooth face. His eyes were dark brown and he was somewhat fit. You can notice a poorly maintained lightsaber on his belt.
Feldon: "Greetings everyone."
He looks to Master Lorhas and speaks.
Feldon: "Master Lorhas, we have had no other survivors from the ship other than the ones here. The others were all dead or died shortly after we got them here. I could do nothing for them."
Lorhas: "Very well, however, this Wookiee knows of Orwen Gered."
Feldon: "That is great news Master, where did he last see him?"
Lorhas: "On the Telares Station, he has found his way to the planet, supposedly."
Feldon: "Yes, we should start looking for him. I can't do anything more for these people. The Republic will handle the rest of the wreckage detail."
Lorhas: "Yes. Feldon, I want you to check flight manifest logs and see if Orwen was listed by either of his names. Mur Eva, keep an eye on those guards and tell me what they are up to. Do not let them take him anywhere just yet."
Both of the apprentices acknowledge him and begin to carry out their orders. Master Lorhas looks at Red Team and speaks.
Lorhas: "Would you mind to stay here? I need to contact someone very quickly."
Master Lorhas asks for a medic to come over to him and a female medic does. He asks to use her wrist comlink and he begins speaking into it.
Lorhas: "This is Jedi Master Lorhas seeking Corlen Doris. Come in Headmaster."
A distorted static sound comes from the wrist comlink. He looks at the medic.
Lorhas: "Why can't I get a transmission?"
Medic: "We recovered lots of equipment from the personnel's bodies, they may have had black market radio jammers still activated. We will have to get away from this area to make a clear signal."
Master Lorhas nods and walks out of the Med Facility with the medic.

*As far as I know Dexer, you cannot check the news on your datapad. That is of course, flexible if you can prove me wrong.*
Feldon and Woroken are locked in conversation at the entrance of the Med station.
Feldon: "I would greatly appreciate your help, but will that be ok with your companions? We can't force you to help us...but any manner you decide to assist, we will certainly be thankful for."
Feldon looks around the station for a second and walks back to Woroken.
Feldon: "As soon as my master is done with his call, we might be able to tell you the details of our mission."
Right at that moment, the double durasteel doors slide open. Dexer walks through the door and seems to be looking for something, although you don't know what. Feldon notices him, motions for Woroken to wait, and greets Dexer.
Feldon: "Are you here looking for a patient? Or are you seeking medical aid?"
Meanwhile, Awne growls at the Republic soldiers watching over Rith. Jes is watching the whole scene, she gives a soft chuckle in Awne's direction.

"Good to see the kids are all healthy again hopefully they learned alittle from this." Vor'en looks at both of them like a sargent looks at two troopers how scerwed up and are now paying for it."Anyone want to let the *Hired Help* what is going on and what we are doing so we can get to doing it." " I mean I like setting around and soaking up the local hospitality as much as the next guy, but I am starting to get bored and that could get me dead. I for one would hate to see that happen." Vor'en looks at the Jedi, cigar in mouth pationtly waiting for his anwser. "Could some get me a cup of caf while I wait?"

Awne's ear twitchs at the sound of a chuckle and raises an eyebrow in that direction, seemingly to silently ask "What's so funny?" Her tail swishes from side to side, the long apendage keeping any guards near her from getting to close; it was nice having such a long tail.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-30 14:15:36)

Feldon looks at Vor'en.
Feldon: "I'm sure if you want payment we could arrange that. We need everybody we can. Not only do we need people, we need you to keep quiet about these events. If you'd like some caf, go try the refreshment dispenser over there. Try not to make a mess because we don't want the spread of germs here."
Feldon points to a device on the wall across the room pass the medical platforms.
In the center of the room, Mur Eva laughs at Awne's statement.
"I'm sorry, just never really seen a Farghul angry."
It seems the group is in lighter spirits as they have been fully rested and they are socializing. It was certainly a welcome trade from being in a crashing ship or a scorching desert. However...

Awne frowns at that, pouting a little "I just don't want the suits getting too close.." she glances at the guards and whips her tail higher and faster then she did before. She chuckles softly at them. Her ears twitch and her head turns "I hearrd crredits, what's this about?"

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-30 14:22:53)

Mur Eva acknowledges Awne's question.
Mur Eva: "If it takes credits to get your help and for you guys to be quiet. We will pay what is necessary."
Mur Eva kinda frowns and crosses her arms...
Mur Eva: "I don't know why you wouldn't want to do this out of the kindness of your heart though. It is for a good cause. But I suppose you have to make a living somehow."

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **ganthet** (2007-11-30 14:40:13)

"Thanks." Vor'en walks over to the refreshment machine and gets if caf then turns to Mur Eva " Good intentions don't keep me feed and roof over my head, but I am sure we can come to some kind of understanding." Vor'en drinks some of the caf and then continues, "I am willing to do as you ask I will keep this quiet and I will help you out but not for free I have reputation to keep." Vor'en says with a smile. Turning to head out the door to the Med Center. "If you need me I will be outside trying to not make a mess." With that Vor'en goes though the doors.

Awne turns her head again to the Jedi woman "Look, I'm a merrcenarry, and while I do worrk forr frree on occasion..I KNOW you can pay and I was alrready on a mission with pay..big pay too. Why do you think any of us werre on that trransporrt to begin with? Therre was a call forr all merrcenarries, bounty hunterrs, and the like to come forr big money if we can bag cerrtain crreaturres and brring them back to the station forr study alive." She grins a little "Now, I'm not about to leave this pack, but I do so hope that I'll be compensated forr the worrk I'll be loosing.." Awne was no fool, they looked like they could pay for help. And if they wanted some of Red Team to help then they'd have to pay, giving up the hunt for another mission was one thing, giving up that reward for a free job was another.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-30 15:49:12)

Mur Eva looks at Awne and smiles.
Mur Eva: "Fair enough, as Vor'en said, niceties aren't enough to live on. I just hope you guys are capable of earning your pay."
Feldon looks at Mur Eva and sighs.
Feldon: "I'm sure they are very capable Sis..."
Mur Eva: "And what do you know of capability?"
Feldon frowns at the question.
Feldon: "We're not all as skilled you Jes..."
Mur Eva: "Honestly Fel, I'm going with my master's belief on this. Otherwise, I'd just as soon do the mission ourselves. We don't need to contract ordinary mercenaries for Jedi work."
Feldon looks at Red Team.
Feldon: "Forgive her please, she's not used to working with anyone but us. She may have a hard time trusting you. But I can sense that you are just fine."
Mur Eva makes a grim look at Feldon.
Mur Eva: "And I thought your senses were more attuned than mine, I sense bad motives amongst these people."
Mur Eva gives the group a hard look.

Woroken was definitely insulted by Mur Eva's accusation. He says flatly,"I assume you did not mean to include me in that last comment. All I have looked for in the last half day is answers about Orwen's situation, of which you clearly had no idea before we spoke, and I have received none. I did not assume that to be a poor motive."

---

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-30 17:19:51)

Mur Eva: "My apologies Woroken, I shouldn't have generalized you with the rest of the mercenaries. I thank your contributions to our mission so far,and you do your band great credit. I would even bound out to say that you should be leading this group if you work with us. Besides, I heard it is unwise to upset a wookiee, you are known to pull people's arms out of their sockets when you get angry."
Mur Eva smiles and hopes her apology is sufficient for Woroken. Feldon just looks unhappy about the entire situation, perhaps embarrased of Mur Eva.

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-30 17:51:50)

Woroken's feelings were hurt, as he had felt his honor had been insulted, but he was one to accept apologie, and give them when necessary. "I try not to pull off people's arms, Mur Eva. Especially strong warriors. I do think you might be a little hasty in your evaluation of the Red Team. Although we are a little rough around the edges, I think overall the group is honorable enough. It is true that most of them are mercenaries, but through my limited time with them, most of them have good hearts. I think they will be extremely helpful to the Republic and the Jedi knights."

Awne growls at the woman her tail flicks harshly in warning almost hitting a guard "Watch it girrly, I alrready don't like you, and this isn't helping. Should listen to yourr brrotherr therre, we'rre a good bunch, but we arren't all nice happy flowerrs you don't surrvive if you stay like that in this prrofession. You'd do well to not talk about my pack like that again, I got a line a people with brroken bones that know not to mess with a Torra.

Ben watches the conversation with some interest. Although he is insulted by what Mura says, he is too hungry to involve himself in the arguement. The sooner they get through this, the sooner he can get some more food in his stomach, and the sooner everything gets resolved. "So what exactly did you call us down here for?" Ben asks curiously.
He also thinks it is funny that Voren is always drinking Caf. At home his father and brother had always drunken it to sobber themselves up from alcohol. But maybe it had other uses.

While everyone is talking in the Med Station, the same unarmed Republic officer from last night walks into the facility. He looks around until he spots Rith.
Officer: "This man is under arrest by order of the Republic....seize him!!!"
Everyone in the room looks at the officer, stunned. The two guards nod to each other, and one gets out a pair of binders.
*Rith, are you going to resist arrest or not?*

Because she has a powerr she can contrrol and we can't? I can do the same things I'm just not trrained! so what? I don't trrust herr..and I'm cerrtainly not gonna let them take Rrith away!"

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-30 22:07:38)

Mur Eva takes a quick look at all of Red Team, her gaze then rests on Awne...she nods to Awne and steps forward.
Mur Eva: "Under what charge is he being placed?"
Republic Officer: "Sabotage of a ship, mass murder."
Mur Eva: "It's not been proved!"
Republic Officer: "We know this, but due to the fact he is with a hostile enemy force and they are at war with us, he must be detained...it's too dangerous to have him free."
Mur Eva looks at Feldon. Feldon looks back, as if he is waiting for Mur Eva to make a move.
Mur Eva: "Then turn him over to the Jedi, put him under our control."
Republic Officer: "Jedi are not soldiers, this is not an enemy POW to you, and this does not require a diplomatic solution. He must be incarcerated, or he could call for reinforcements and have this settlement attacked."
*Continued….I am awaiting Rith's response*

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-30 22:16:54)

The black bearded officer looks at Awne with concern.
Republic Officer: "Perhaps they thought him dead already, the Remnant is known to not completely value the lives of their men, so long as the job gets done. We don't know, but we will get to the bottom of this. I can see this is your friend, and I am sorry...but too many lives are at stake to let him stay free. If this settlement gets attacked and people die, the lives would be on your shoulders."
The officer pauses for a second and looks at the Jedi, along with Red Team... then speaks.
Republic Officer: "You may have not heard this, but twenty minutes ago, a Star Destroyer just came in orbit of Tatooine."

"wh...what?" Awne pales, a star destroyer? here? oh stars no..how? "That doesn't mean it was his doing! those fighterrs could have called! It doesn't mean it was him. He's strrong, and if Jedi arre half as strrong as they look then he's betterr off being with them."

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-30 22:26:40)

Mur Eva nods to Woroken and attempts to comlink him.
Lorhas: "Yes Padawan?"
Mur Eva: "Master, we have a situation at the Med Station...please come quickly."
Lorhas: "Remain calm padawan, use the Force. We are good distance away, the mercenary jammers were worse than I thought. Do not let him go under arrest, there is something special about that man."
Mur Eva: "But master, their is a Star Destroyer in orbit, and if they use their bombardment, our mission will be a failure!"
Lorhas: "Mur Eva, do this...for anything I ever taught you and for me."
Mur Eva speaks with conviction.
Mur Eva: "Yes Master."
She turns the comlink off and looks at the officer.
Mur Eva: "You will not be taking this man today. My master believes he did not do it, he has a feeling."
Officer: "The lives of millions can not rest on a Jedi hunch, I'm here to save lives Jedi, what about you all?"

Woroken, doubting very seriously the guard understood shriwook, nevertheless said out loud, "I am sorry officer, but I stand with the Jedi and the Farghul. I don't think we can let you take Rith prisoner." The wookiee still didn't fully trust the tie pilot, but evidence was mounting that maybe he deserved a second chance.

Rith still unsure of everything was getting extremely tired of being accused of things he could not recall. His patience wearing thin, Rith stepped up to the guards. "I will not be going with you today, nor any other day for that matter." Rith clenches his fists, wishing he still had his blasters, curse them for disarming him. His anger beginning to rise Rith turns to the jedi. "So what now jedi?"

Mur Eva: "This has to be done Fel."
Mur Eva waves her hand at both entrances and the doors seal shut. The soldiers bring up their blaster rifles. Immediately when they do, the lights go out. You cannot see anything.

He shouts with fear in his voice.

Unable to see, Rith immediately crouches to the floor. Though he could still somewhat fight he was at a major disadvantage should they start blasting. reaching up Rith grabs Awne and pulls her down next to him and moves her behind him slightly so as to protect her from where he thought the soldiers were standing. "Be careful Awne."

Woroken also was engulfed by darkness. He too crouches to the ground, as not to take an errant blaster shot. He pulls out the hold out sporting blaster, he had taken from the decesased pilots, just in case it was necessary. While crouching, the wookie switched the blaster to the "stun" setting.

Awne purrs softly at how he's protecting her, and takes his hand in hers tugging him gently as she whispers into his ear "Come with me, I can see what's going on." She leads him to an opening the guards made as they cower, she grabs Ben's hand as she passes him and leads the two men into a safer corner, pulling Ben and Rith to crouch, releasing Ben's hand but still holds Rith's as she whispers to the two "Miss Eva's about to take out her lightsaberr..and herr brrotherr seems rready to do something as well, the guarrds arre scarred."

A blue blade snap-hisses to life, and you hear the hum of the powerful energy weapon. Blaster bolts tear through the darkened facility, the blade reflects them back and the fight ends quickly. The lights come on and you see all three of the Republic personnel with their backs to the wall. They are unarmed now. She holds the lightsaber up to the Officer's throat.
Mur Eva: "Listen well, because I'm only going to say this once. If you tell anyone about these happenings today I will hunt you all down. Your families and lovers will die first, then after slow torture, you will die.If me besting all three of you right there is any indication of my powers, you had better be wise enough to follow my advice."
Mur Eva waves her hand at the Officer.
Mur Eva: "You will leave now, and we will tell our superiors that Rith has died in this station's care."
Officer: "We will leave now, and tell our superiors that Rith died in this station's care."
All 3 of the Republic men get up and leave the facility immediately, and Mur Eva turns to you all.
Mur Eva: "Ok guys, you need to get out of here just in case they don't believe my threat. We will meet up with you later...and please don't leave the planet, we don't know what that Star Destroyer will do. Get your equipment and leave, but all of Rith's equipment must stay here."

A monment later Awne moves throw them leading Rith and the others. "What the hell is going on." Seeing as Rith is not armed Vor'en hands the pilot his E-11."

The events with the Jedi happen so quickly Ben doesn't have time to act. He is dragged down and into a corner by Awne when the lights go out. He is horrified by the threats Mura says to the guards, but at least they are safe.
Ben responds to Radon's question, when he asks about Ben's home *playing for Radon*, "I have a home about two and a half hours by speeder from here. But I'm not sure where we can get the speeder, or if we will be completely safe the whole way there. Plus my home has probably been overrun by swoopers by now. If you guys are willing to scare a few swoop bikers though, I can provide us with a fairly secret and safe home. The question is where to get a big and safe speeder."

Red Team walks out of the Med Facility. They are back on the bustling, dust-covered streets of Mos Esre. Many people are either walking, talking, or trying to sell something. You see bazaars set up along some of the building walls, with various creatures trying to get people to shop. Some of you have a feeling they are selling junk. The settlement is quite expansive, and you are now free to head in any direction now that the Jedi no longer need you. Speeders continue to hover through the area trying to avoid people. You've also noticed a few armed people walking around, they seem to be thugs. However, you have also spotted Two Republic soldiers who don't seem to be looking for anyone in particular.

Awne drags Rith to the store with the woman and smiles pleasently, her tail flicking gently "Hello ma'am, would you happen to have something that would fit this gentleman herre?" she asks motioning to Rith.

After being assured, through Ben's translation, that the two information brokers meant no harm, Woroken's attention began to wander. "Let Awne take care of all that," he thought to himself. He still wasn't sure he wanted Rith to be packing weapons right now, but with the last few days they had, everyone probably should be able to defend themselves.
He was pleased with one new development. Through the "charades" game he had been playing with the party, it seemed the Ben had quite a natural talent for languages. Ben had completely picked up on shri wook. He understood virtually everything that Woroken said. It was nice to have another in the party that could understand the wookiee's language.

Maybe one of you mechanic types can rig the gun so that it stays on stun only, and can't be switched to kill. That would keep everyone safe, and let Rith contribute.

*Continuity note, I just remembered humans can't speak in Shrywork, hence Han speaking basic. Since so much has already happened, I'll say Ben has been whispering in Woroken's ear.*
Ben looks at Rith, "If you really must use pistols and nothing else, then how about Woroken's blaster pistol. I can even try to modify it for you. Also I don't think we have time to do missions for local drug dealers and crime runners, and they won't take credits. Plus that is the last thing you need if you are going to win a case with the Republic. We don't want to oppose you. But none of us can help you, not even Awne, if you don't try to work with us. To be honest after you attacked Radon, a lot of us don't trust you with a fully powered weapon. If you dont learn to trust us, then we can't help you, or I can't at least."

*oh damn now that's a choice to make*
Awne looks from Rith to the rest of Red Team. This was certainly a big choice to make. Stay with a team she'd known for only two days and thought of as her pack. Or this human she'd known for less then a day, that tried to kill one of the members of the pack, that was nice to her as well. Her tail flicks in thought, running over things.
"Rrith..arre you surre you wouldn't rratherr stay with the grroup? if we continue with the mission we werre given the rrewarrd is rratherr handsome..and those ah..people may help you to rrememberr things. If these..gentleman take crredits I'll buy you a blasterr of yourr choosing prrovided I can afforrd it."
She glances at Ben "It's my choice who I go with. And he has a point, you lot did drraw yourr blasterrs on him back on ship when we werre unsurre of who he was orr his motives. Is it any wonderr why he won't trrust you? orr that he wants a weapon? If he's unarrmed arround you, you might trry to kill him but he won't be able to defend himself! How is that fairr Ben? Worro? You can't trrust unless you give trrust."
To the men she asks simply "How much you offerr forr serrvices? and what would be the benefits? Mind I'm not agrreeing yet but I would like to know what's in it forr me."
She was no fool. she wanted to stay with Rith and her pack, but..if the men could offer something better then loyalty then she'd concider it more.

Listening to the insane rambling of the tie fighter was beginning to wear on the wookiee. He wanted to honor the wishes of the Jedi to protect him, but he was not going to allow the Red team, whom he had began to regard as friends, to constantly be threatened that the unstable pilot would explode at any moment. "Blasters to your front can be dealt with, blasters to your back can't," he thought. While Radon might have been exteremly unpleasant to the tie fighter, that moment had long since passed before the unprovoked blaster attack occurred. It was certainly not heat of the moment anger, it was something much more sinister.
If sense could not be talked into him, then Woroken would be perfectly content with Rith going into business for himself. Awne, too, if it came to it. He would explain exactly that to the Jedis if necessary.

Ben looks wearily at Awne,"I'm not going to justify my actions back them because I'm not proud of them. But at the time it seemed like he was the cause of my problems and possibly a threat to my survival. That doesn't make what I did right, and if it will help things, Rith I completely apoligize for my actions back on the ship. I should not have pulled my gun on you, and I am sorry I did."
Ben looks at Awne, and the confusion in her eyes. "I know you probably don't care for my apology, or my friendship, or my aid, but please listen to me. If you care at all for Awne, you will not force her to make this decision."

Deeluk: "Hey now, we came offering you job opportunities, and yea...we will give you weapons if you need some. Just don't go asking for E-web blasters or anything. If you want to do a job, we have a client called Alus has been giving us some trouble lately. She is a slave, her and her family have not been pulling her weight.

Ben translates what the Rodain says for the others. "I'm sorry Awne, but I will have no part in this. It is because of slimos like these that my father and brother were killed. And I could never support slavery." They're lucky I don't open fire on them here. Ben thinks to himself. Hopefully Awne would never join these scavangers, but if she did, it would show her true colors.

Rith looks to the Rodian. "I must confer with my friend, please give me a moment." Rith steps over to Awne grabbing her arm Rith pulls her over to the side away from prying ears. Rith looks her in the eye. "Awne i can see my sister being raped like it was right before me, yes i remember who she was." Rith lowers his head with a slight sadness pooling in his eyes. "Awne, Reka was my sister." "When we were young she was raped and murdered, I told her i would keep her safe after our parents were killed but i failed." A crimson tear begins to streak down Rith's face. "She was only 12, in my rage the vessels in my eyes burst and blood filled my eyes turning them red, and i killed the thugs, but in the end I could not save her." "You asked about my eyes, It is a condition, something i was born with." "That is what they told me in the med bay." "Awne I still see Reka, I can still hear her screaming my name calling for help." "Awne please, I will not leave those children to this torment." "I will save them on my own if I must, but i am asking you to come." "Rith wipes the tear from his face, mentally cursing himself for being weak, and shortly heads back over to the Rodian. With a stern face showing no sign of the sadness Rith was feeling he made the deal. "I will take the job, and i request a heavy blaster for my first day's payment so i will have some means to efficiently guard them." "Will that suffice?" Rith stood firmly awaiting the Rodian's answer.
*Oh and on a side note to Woro, Rith walked up to Radon face to face not from behind and tried to shoot him in the face… just wanted to clarify that my char is a head on guy, not a coward… so maybe that will give everyone a little more understanding of him.*

Awne stood a moment longer where she was, *'he rrememberred something'* she looked down as his story ran through her mind. She was a mercenary, if the price was good she'd take almost any job..almost..she hated slavery. He was right those people couldn't stay there..but..*'hmmm'* Any idea was forming. That house was going to be out of the way..someplace they could all hide she just needed to get the others to agree to this or have a way to meet with them later. They were going to need help once she and Rith got those people out of that house.
She walks back to the group slowly, she makes sure to pass through the group instead of by the side like she had, making a note to smile sadly at them, making it appear that she would be leaving them while whispering to Vor'en and Ben, the two she had passed closest to "help us rrescue them." She then moves beside Rith and crosses her arms over her chest her tail flicking behind her to the others as though to say 'come help.' "8 hourr shift, 100 a peice perr hourr. Do we get a speederr to get therre? and I'd like at least 400 up frront if not all of the 800. I want all the terrms beforre I agrree to anything."
She wasn't going to let people stay in slavery.

Ben looks shocked at Awne. This was a bad idea, a very poorly thought out, bad idea. "Awne, could I talk to you over here for a second." Ben steps away from the group of people and waits for Awne to come over. "Awne, do you realize how stupid of an idea this is? Trust me, I hate slavery as well, but there is no way we can safely rescue these slaves. If it were possible, if we had some place safe to take them than I would say do it. Awne, this is Tatoonie. It's owned by the Hutts. The law of the land is the gangs and the crime lords. If we were to free the slaves they would hunt us down. And not just a few mercenaries. Bordo could bring every bounty hunter on this planet and off it after us. It would involve killing lots of gangsters, and putting the lives of the slaves in far greater danger than they are in now. As much as I would like to help the slaves, I might actually hurt them by trying to save them. Do you understand? As we are now, we can't save them. Maybe with the help of the Jedi, and the support of the New Republic. But neither of them would want to get involved, because we would be infringing on planetary law. Slavery is legal on this planet, and the Republic can't stop that. Please think about what you are doing before you decide to follow this plan. I've already lost my family to the crime on this planet, I don't need to lose you too." Ben looks anxiously at Awne, trying to see if his speech has had any affect on her.

Awne sighs as she looks at Ben having been pulled away from Rith and the shady men. "Ben...they'rre poorr people, they need help. Legal orr not would you want people to stay like that? if you could help them? maybe get them off the planet? What if it was yourr family, you'd want to help them wouldn't you? They'rre a family and they need help, if we don't help them who will? You don't have to come, we'll catch up I'm surre. But I'm not going to sit back and let them stay like they arre Ben...Vorr'en.." She sees him pass her and stops him with a hand on his arm and whispers in his ear "If you won't come help us rrescue them then please look afterr the otherrs forr me." She smiles slightly at him "I can't let them stay therre Vorr'en..if not us who can help them then it'll be someone else that'll beat them...I can't let that happen."
She moves from the two humans and whispers about the same to the wookiee making it look like a goodbye as she hugs him. Then moves to Radon, she smiles and pulls him into a hug again whispering the same into his ear along with more "Rradon, please be carreful..I know you don't like Rrith, I won't forrce you to come, but if you only don't want to come because it's Rrith, please then think of the woman and herr family that arre in trrouble. Eitherr way..please take carre of yourrself." She kisses his cheek "Maybe we'll meet up again and have that drrink. Don't go dieing now you hearr?" She smiles and nods to the other human not yet part of Red Team "Good luck."
She returns to Rith's side awaiting the answer from the two men to her previous questions. Legal or not, she wasn't going to let this continue, she couldn't save them all but if she could save at least one family then by the stars she'd do it.

His faces drops into a scowl, "Frankly I don't know which is worse. Look I may not raise a hand to hurt those people, but I'm not raising a finger to help them. You can do what you want, but if you go through with this your life is marked." Dexer smiles slightly, "Which means it will be harder to move around on the planet.

Woroken, like most wookiees, hated the idea of slavery. He didn't really want to go on a risky misson and antagonize every crime lord in the local area, either. Listening to Awne's cue to "free the slaves" would kill two jawas with one round of blaster fire, though. He could help strike a blow against some slavers, and he could follow through on his agreement with the Jedis to keep the group together and look out for the tie fighter. He tells Ben his feelings on the issue, to see if Ben might be swayed.

As Rith headed to the cantina to get a drink he wondered about the situation. This was going to be tough, very tough, but since when did he care about being out numbered. He thought and a smile came to his face, the more there were the more he could kill and that was a very nice thought. He would tear them apart with his bare hands if that was what i meant, he would probably enjoy that more than anything. They would pay one way or another for what they had done. Maybe the hutts were big and bad, but nothing would stand between him and this goal. He would save those children or die trying. Rith wanders around trying to find the Cantina. "Where is that dang place?" he thinks. "Its got to be around here somewhere.

After wandering around for a little bit. Rith discovers a sign on a fairly large building in the center of town. It is called the Racer's Bend cantina. Rith walks into the brown-colored theme cantina and immediately notices it is packed, this establishment is much bigger than the Bantha Track's you were at last night. The lights are really low. You see many people around with powerful looking weapons, and these people are in raggy clothing with bandoliers, much like Bordo's thugs you saw a few moments ago. There seems to be a lot of card playing, like pazaak or sabacc going on. The Twi'lek male bartender is currently engaged in conversation with a short pink-haired lady. Her clothing seems to be that of a smuggler with a tan cargo vest.

When Rith looks at her face, she has striking features. She has nice cheek bones with dark mystic eyes. By looking at her you can tell she has been through a lot, but she has also retained some of her innocence.

That is unless you want to find yourself staring down the butt of every bounty hunter and gangster's gun this side of Tatoonie. I wouldn't be surprised if the reason the Remnant hasn't taken over here is the gangs. The hutt's have a pretty strong hold on Tatoonie, and I wouldn't be surprised of they don't take too kindly to the Remnant's actions. This may even be good for the Republic."

"It's alrright Vorr, Ben and Worro arre speaking with a local about a trransporrt when we finish the job.." she didn't want to say slaves while in such a crowd "And I'm heading to wherre I last saw Rrith go, he said something about getting a drrink, so I'm looking."

Rith grits in aggrevation, he could not hear over the chatter of the cantina. He wanted to just yell at everyone to shut up. As Rith sits he checks every so often out of the corner of his crimson eyes to make sure she is still conversing with the bar tender. "Not being able to hear what they were saying was making Rith that much more curious about why she was here. Rith decides that he will wait till she is done then he will confront her.

All this time Radon had limped along with the group almost completely silently. Despite being in the peak of health after a full night submerged in a bacta tank, he still felt nauseous. He hadn't ever gotten used to such submersion, even though he'd experienced it quite a number of times during his podracing career. Therefore, Radon only managed to smile in return to the barest of pleasantries by everyone who greeted him that morning. Thankfully, his clothing survived almost entirely intact, save for that cut that marked where Rith's first blaster hit his thigh. He'd also gotten his blaster back, and it took every ounce of his willpower not to draw it and shoot, maybe kill, Rith outright. He'd almost succeeded when he got ambushed, but he knew that starting a blaster fight in the middle of the bazaar was a death sentence.
Perhaps it was good that Rith went off on his own, then. The temptation to make the Imperial experience his final breath was getting too great. He even held some contempt for the Jedi Master who responded to his aid - why in the world would their Jedi rescuers let someone who tried to murder him go?! Because they *felt* something? *Please* - that made about as much sense as an honest Hutt. The only saving grace was seeing how the Jedi's apprentice intimidated the Republic soldiers into doing as her Master wished. Now *that* was pleasing to witness. He wondered if he could one day gain the courage, and maybe even the power, to do that himself. As it stood, the only saving grace he saw was in the revelation that the Jedi knew Headmaster Doris - he had tried to contact the Headmaster directly right in front of the podracer. He already assumed nothing was truly what it seemed, but their direct connection made everything all the more confusing. He couldn't help but wonder what their relationship was all about.
Radon then nodded as the group 'declined' the offer from the Rodians. Endearing himself to a crime boss wasn't all that distasteful to him (the most powerful people did make the best acquaintances, in his experience), but what was being suggested - enlisting - was just too hard a notion to swallow. That Dexer guy didn't seem to make things any smoother, either. At least, that man was up front about being a man of the street. Radon had met too many of his kind not to notice, and someone not trying to hide it at all was... quaint.
So what were his options? Awne obviously chose to side with Rith, even after all that happened, so going with her meant going with Rith, and that was out of the question. Now, despite his enormous amount of respect for the others, they *were* talking about going up to free some slaves, and in Radon's mind that *always* ended up in a shootout. And a shootout was just the kind of situation he didn't want to be in; he'd rather be racing.
That last thought made him make up his mind. Finally breaking his long silence, he said to the others: "I'm not going with you. Why you guys always want to head towards your deaths is beyond me."
He pulled up the hood of his all-temperature cloak to hide his features once more, as he pulled out his comlink and dialed home. He hoped he was within range of Mos Espa as he spoke in Ryl, the native language of his podracing agent, saying: ""
*Deception +8 for the Disguise, take 10 if possible.*

Rith is observing the pink haired lady in the Racer's Bend cantina, he can't hear what she is saying...but she seems to be enjoying herself with the bartender. While Rith is being mesmerized at the bar, a loud crashing is heard at the entrance. You see some people in a group arguing, then a tough-looking trandoshan breaks free from the group. Someone rushes the trandoshan with a vibrodagger, the trandoshan rushes him back and body checks the man with a vibrodagger. The man falls over and the trandoshan just steps over him. The cantina goes silent, and the trandoshan seems indifferent. He is wearing a black-mercenary type of armor with ammo pouches and multiple weapon pouches. He approaches the bar and promptly orders a drink.

Awne listens to the directions Vor'en gives her over the comlink and smiles "Thank you Vorr, we'll meet you therre." She ends the call and instead calls the rest of the group and tells them how to get to the Cantina. She listens intentle as Ben tells her what Radon had said. She thanks him and calls Radon, "Rradon what's this about you not coming with us? Please, we should all stick togetherr, if it's Rrith I'll make surre he won't go nearr you again. Please Rradon, we need you." As she spoke she made her way to the Cantina. "Please atleast meet us at the Cantina, if only for a goodbye drrink." She ends the call and opens the door, looking around in confusion at the silent bar. She spots the red eyed human as well as a body on the floor. She pauses a moment, her tail flicking, then steps over the body and over to Rith.

Woroken decided that perhaps a Cantina visit was a good idea, for nothing else to get out of the oppressive heat. Maybe he can buy a Hotna Ice or two before embarking on the slave free-ing mission. He didn't think any of the Jedis would approve of the mission, but, the orders were for Red Team to stay together. The orders did not specify what they were to be doing, he supposed.

"Please at least meet us at the Cantina, if only for a goodbye drrink," Awne said over the comm. Radon declined to answer. He knew he wouldn't be able to stand the sight of Rith walking around a free man not being punished for his attempted murder, but if Awne wanted to stay with the scum, that was her choice and he would respect that, even as his respect for her began slipping away ever so slowly. Radon wasn't the type to force any personal decision on anyone, and that made him different from Rith - at least that's what he thought.
In the end, he decided that at least some semblance of a response was the polite thing to do. He replied, "No, thank you. Maybe next time, Ms. Tora."
With that, he returned to calling Mos Espa, waiting for his agent to respond.

She wouldn't do that, at least not infront of these people, if she was going to break down and cry it would be some place no one could see her. Instead she tried again "Please Rradon...what could we do to get you to come with us? besides leaving Rrith."

"*Nothing,*" was Radon's silent answer. He didn't mean it just because Rith was there; he meant it because there really wasn't anything tying him to the group other than the fact that they'd survived a crash together. They were lucky survivors, but to Radon, that was it. He didn't even once feel like they were a 'family' or a 'cadre' or whatever Awne thought they were. "*Pack, was it?*" he asked himself. Hadn't he already told them he was going to part ways with them as soon as they got planet-side?
"Sorry," he replied honestly, sensing the distress in her voice, "but I already told you I wasn't going to stick around as soon as we got here."

"*Oh, I'll be staying; I just won't be going with you,*" he thought. The trauma of yesterday's events had made him momentarily forget the reason he'd even decided to go down here in the first place. He was exactly where he wanted to be: Mos Esre. In just a few short hours, he'd already seen first-hand the Republic occupation force, as well as the power structure laid down by the local crime boss. Add the orbiting Star Destroyer and the Falsoor company to the equation, and it was pretty much a recipe for disaster. The rest of Red Team had known enough of Radon to know that he would be the last person to go straight into the heart of a disaster, but Tatooine was his home. It survived the fringe and rule of the Empire, and Radon wanted to make sure it would survive the complications brought on by this new settlement of Mos Esre. He was tied to the planet, that much was certain in his mind. If allowed a bit of hubris, he would even say he and the planet were one.
That was the thought running through his mind as he replied, "I'm sure we will." After that, he began to reach for the controls in order to block her frequency, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it, somehow. Instead, he just redialed home again, and resumed attempting to contact his agent.
Or maybe he should try looking for Falsoor. Wasn't the whole point of Red Team's hunters coming to Mos Esre about employment under Falsoor? He decided to ask around for directions while he waited for a reply from home. If 'auntie' didn't reply, he would at least have an alternative option.

Radon, being quite frustrated with the current events, shrouds his appearance just enough to get by on the streets of Mos Esre. He begins asking the somewhat unfriendly locals of Mos Esre on how to find some connection to Falsoor on this settlement. It's not even ten minutes before he runs into a friendly Duros spacer who gives him exact directions to a nearby Falsoor facility. He learns that the Falsoor facility is quite close to the eastern archway of Mos Esre, about two hundred meters from his current location. Radon begins making his way through the busy streets when his comlink starts beeping.
Meanwhile, Red Team begins slowly reuniting in the festive air of the Racer's Bend. Everything seems to have been returned to life after the incident with the trandoshan. The talk of the cantina seems to be that there is a local podrace going on through the canyons not far from Mos Esre, it appears to be a fundraiser of some kind. This seems to be the most important topic so far. Ordenn, however...seems to just be relaxing at the bar despite what is going on.

Radon nodded at the others as they split up, perhaps forever, watching them move towards the cantina where Awne and Rith had gone off to. As for him, he had an entirely different direction to head for. He began to question the locals, and thankfully, his galaxy-trotting had gotten him quite familiar with the nuances of the Duros language. It was much easier to understand than Shyriiwook, that much was certain, and it was much easier to find one of them "friendly neighborhood Duros" in busy spacer towns such as Mos Esre. It didn't take him long to chat one up and figure out where the Falsoor facilities were.
As he began his 200-meter trek to the facility, Radon wondered if perhaps the Headmaster already knew he was okay and heading that way. It was a safe bet, after all, that *someone* in the Republic would've recognized his face the moment the bacta had fixed him up, and would've told the Jedi who Radon was. Then again, he'd also heard about how well-traveled Jedi could be, so it was just as unlikely that the Jedi Master or his apprentice didn't figure out his identity for themselves. In any case, he decided that paying a courtesy call to the Corlen Doris to inform the Headmaster of Radon's good health would be the... diplomatic... thing to do. At the very least, it would get him in the facility, as he had the very valid excuse of "I'm a survivor of your transport."
His thoughts cut short as he finally heard a beeping noise from his trusty comlink. He accepted the transmission, eagerly listening for the sound of a familiar voice.

Sienn Var: "How is my favorite mild-mannered podracing jockey? It feels like I haven't heard from you in ages. How was your trip to the Telares station? Come on! Tell me tell me tell me..."
It seemed Sienn was like a little kid as she was so excited to hear from Radon, quite contrary to her professionalism as his agent.

She wanted to know everything, as usual. Naturally, he'd have to tell her *something*, but Radon would have to conceal his most recent unfortunate medical treatment. It wasn't all that hard, given that the warmth of recognition made him truly smile as few things ever really could, and nearly made him forget the tragedy that was yesterday.
"It *has* been ages," he replied brightly. "As for Telares, well, I didn't stay there long. I managed to hook up with the folks at Falsoor and they, uh, let me crash in Mos Esre." He hoped his play on words, truthful as they were, didn't alarm Sienn at all. "But I'm bored to tears now, ," he continued with some light laughter, letting himself loose as only family would allow. "So, you wouldn't happen to know if there's a race around these parts I could sign up for, now would you? Or, at least, point me in the direction of who would?"

The comlink pauses for a second. *This is in Ryl.*
Sienn Var: "They LET my number one star crash?!?! Perhaps you should have flown it dearie! The Falsoor organization will certainly hear from me for their work with incompetent pilots. Ugh, well...thank the stars that you lived. Anyways, I figured you were calling about a race. And let me tell you, this one is HOT. We can't make money off this race, but we can boost your public image. It's a fundraiser for Mos Esre as it has been struggling financially. By helping this fledgling settlement you would definitely secure your name in this city's history, and maybe even bolster your reputation in Tatooine even further. I could see it now...the HERO of Tatooine. You could be the most well know podracer of Tatooine with some work. There is one slight setback though, you have no sponsor for the race and it is in two days. We have some who are very interested in sponsoring you, but it will be a rush to go through all the procedures. Currently I know Bordo the Hutt wants to sponsor you, he could even pay you during this fundraiser, however, there is a lot of rumors circulating that he is the reason Mos Esre is in financial and economical decay. They are JUST rumors, but you wouldn't get recognized in a good light by the people if it is true. Other than that, there are some businesses in Mos Esre that want to sponsor you. I even got a call from Corlen Doris, the Headmaster of the station you came out of. Your winnings from any of these people will mean the money is contributed to the city. I'll leave the choice in your hands darling, but you need to start warming up those engines!"

"*Hero of Tatooine?!*" Radon exclaimed inwardly. "Podracing star" was nice enough already, but... hero? It would be the first time he'd hear of that word being linked to his own name. He listened intently to the options Sienn had laid out; normally, he hated to have to take any sides, preferring to avoid the issue of choosing any one side in the first place. It worked well enough for him in the past. Since early in his career, Sienn handled everything business-side of the racing circuit; all Radon had to concern himself with was his piloting. In any case, the moment he heard the headmaster's name, he knew he had already made that choice just the day before. He would accept the Falsoor sponsorship.
Despite the fiasco that was their transport, Radon accepted that he owed the company for the trip. In fact, Corlen Doris was kind enough to simply request the sponsorship as a favor, and didn't shove a business deal in front of his face like most others. That was the kind of treatment he expected from the Hutts and swore he would neither have anything to do with such deals nor be linked directly to the local syndicate. On the other hand, if he sided with the local businesses, he risked the ire of the Hutt. In the end, Falsoor was the safest choice - it at least had the backing of the Jedi, if not the Republic. If anyone wanted to come after him for not supporting Bordo, Radon would have the support of a moneyed corporation that could either ask for Jedi help, or bring in a few mercenaries like it did for the hunt.
"" he replied in her language. ""
Radon continued to make his way to the Falsoor facility as he waited for confirmation.

She smiles and walks to the rest of red team, taking a seat beside the soldier she'd come to think of as a friend.; "So what does this place have to eat? Hopefully something with out meat.." She mutters the last part as she looks around for the waitress she saw Vor'en speaking with hoping she'd bring the menu and she could get a drink from her.

Dexer leans in towards Vor'en, "The Star Destroyer does present a problem, but hopefully it will have more to worry about then us. As for transportation, we are seating in a veritable hotbed of smugglers and low-lifes. Now if you'll excuse me..." Dexer stands up and turns to the crowd, he pauses and looks back at the group, "You can pay for the meal, consider it a part of my advance." With that he moves further into the cantina, "Why hello kind sir, I was wondering..."
*If this is before we have had a chance to eat, then I'll be back. Gather Info +12 to find someone willing to transport us off planet.*

Eventually, a waitress comes by and gets all of your food and drinks. *Each meal for each character is 10 credits, that includes the drink. Please tell me who is paying for what.* *Dexer's Gather Info 12+3=15; Dexer's Perception check 6+2=8. Dexer gains 50 experience.*
Dexer gets up after finishing his meal, and during the conversation, he could not spot anyone listening to them. He notices that the cantina is quite packed from shoulder to shoulder with various beings. He asks around for about four hours about people willing to transport him off the planet. The general consensus of the responses seems to be that everyone is afraid of getting shot down by the Star Destroyer or boarded by the Remnant.
Woroken has a nice meal and conversation then he gets up and leaves the cantina. He walks outside to the cool night breeze and he cannot see many people out in the streets. He begins to wonder how the trandoshan got away so quickly. However, he can see an old woman in the distance attempting to stop passerby, she seems to be begging for help.

Radon's comlink emits a response.
Sienn: "I'll let Corlen know right away hun. You take care of yourself before the big race, ok?"
Radon puts away his comlink and walks the rest of the way through the thinning streets of Esre. He gets to a very small building with a domed-roof, standing about 15 fifteen feet high. Someone in a silver uniform is standing outside of the facility. It is a human female with a pale face and a moderate amount of make up. She has brown hair and brown eyes with her hair in a pony tail. She quickly spots Radon taking interest to the establishment.
Sheyla: "I'm representative Sheyla on behalf of Falsoor, how may I help you?"

She is short, probably due to declining integrity in her spine. She has white hair with a face that seems wrinkled and very worn from the suns. She has very worn out clothing that seems to be raggedy.
Old Lady: "Hello sir, could you help me with my grandchildren in my home?"
The lady musters the best smile she can as she looks at Bennosuke intently.

Bordo has guards watch over them and they have began abusing my kids, I would like them liberated from the men. I want to get us out of here...if you could help, I would greatly appreciate it. I can give you directions to the house if you are interested."
Meanwhile, Rith is trying to get Ordenn's attention in the cantina.

*Disguise DC 26*
Radon looked over the domed-roof facility that belonged to Falsoor. It was imposing, but not all that spectacular. The woman standing outside of the facility was of more interest to him at the moment. He expected Falsoor to post guards, not officials. Could he have been wrong about them being moneyed and all?
Without dropping his 'disguise' for now, he answers, "I'm here as a favor to Headmaster Doris. He's expecting a call from me, but my comlink isn't strong enough to contact him on Telares. I was hoping you could assist me in this manner, Representative Sheyla."
He then felt the tinge of hunger swelling in his body. Submersion in bacta may have been healing, but it certainly wasn't filling. "I would also appreciate a hot meal. I believe it's the least Falsoor owes me after my transport crashed and got me stranded in the desert."

"But its going to be very dangerous, and you are going to have to trust us. First i have to ask you this; we can free them, but what will you four do once we've saved them. Where will you go. I don't want to put you in greater danger if you don't have some place to hide. Also is it this house?"

'Well if transportation is out at the moment better look for a place to lay low and dig up some info on the area.' He heads out of the cantina giving a nod to Ben as he passes him. "I'll be back kid." Dexer stops for a second, 'What was that about a trando? Better do some checking on Bordo and his goons."
*Well might as well keep trying at what I'm best at: Gather Info +12 to find out some more about Bordo's goons, particularly of the trando variety. Also I think I have enough XP for level 2, that what you got? Gather Info is +13 if I leveled*

Awne leans toward Ordenn and looks around, she sees nothing out of the ordinary. Also, while Awne is alert she can hear the faint sound of her comlink beeping. She looks at her comlink. Ordenn looks right back at Awne.
Ordenn: "Say, weren't you on the Telares station? You survived the crash? Why do you want to save slaves?"
Ordenn looks very concerned as she converses with Awne.
Back at Bennosuke's situation, he is talking with Alus. She seems to be very relieved.
Alus: "Well, that is certainly my house you have there! I know Bocce, but that's about it! This is wonderful."
The old woman claps and dances a little, but she grabs her hip after a few seconds and stops.
Radon speaks with Sheyla at the facility.
Sheyla: "Well, we can definitely get you those things. I apologize for the trauma and suffering you have went through, you will be compensated. But first, I need to see some identification and tell me what you want with Corlen, I must screen all his contacts."

After you finish your business with him, Doris has reserved you the best hotel in Mos Esre. You will also have two Twi'lek escorts to take you everywhere and your own luxury speeder. Please, right this way."
Sheyla motions to inside the facility, the double doors slide open revealing the cramped Falsoor office. It is all white with high-tech machinery beeping and whirring. A protocol droid is behind the desk, monitoring all the systems. Sheyla guides you to a room behind the desk. The room is dark and only illuminated by the HoloNet system at the end of the small room.

Lorhas: "I'm afraid with the Star Destroyer in orbit it would be quite dangerous to transport them off, we know of their intentions and anyone leaving is likely to be blasted or taken under custody. Although I'm not sure what they would do, it would be wise to wait until they leave. If you are looking for a safe place for refugees, I would have them taken to the Republic outpost in this settlement. I doubt anyone would hassle them, it would be very unwise.

He did have to admit that Falsoor was perhaps going a bit overboard, but then again, they did owe him. He followed the representative into the office and into the communications area, giving a polite nod to Sheyla as she left the communications room.
The podracer stepped up in front of the holorecorder, and began transmitting to the Headmaster's frequency. "Headmaster Doris, this is Radon Antila. I'm at your facility now. If my agent hasn't contacted you yet, I'm here to tell you I'm taking your sponsorship for the upcoming race."

Ben thanks Awne before returning his comlink to his belt and moving back to the conversation. "Wait for us outside the Republic's Embassy. We should be there some time before tomorrow morning. I don't know when, but if you can wait for us, we will bring you your grandchildren."

Woroken felt knots begin to form in his stomoach, nerves as he began mentally preparing for the upcoming "mission." Keeping the slaves unharmed was priority one. He didn't think he would be able to face the grandmother again, if something happened to one of the her grandchildren. He just hoped that the Red team would be able to find its focus today, as it had been clearly fragmented since the crash.

A hologram of Corlen Doris emits from the projector of the HoloNet computer. It hums with energy as it displays the figure.
Doris: "That is wonderful news Mr. Antila. I've been dying to break into podracing and you are one of the most sought out pilots out there. I would say if you do well then there is no need for you to be a free agent anymore. You could consider full business with my organization. Ok, I will have a pit crew and a pod assign to you, they will bear the colors of Falsoor. The race is in two days and I trust you will be prepared? My people there will accomodate you to make you feel welcome to our team. But in the mean time, I'm bogged down in procedures to advert the disaster about our transport. It's very warming to see that you survived. I apologize for my men's mistakes."
Meanwhile, Alus gives Red Team a detailed map of her house and the possible location of the guards.

Radon smirked at the unexpectedly enthusiastic reply.
"Please don't get ahead of yourself, Headmaster. I am simply upholding my end of our gentlemen's agreement from yesterday. I said I would consider you as a regular sponsor, and now I say I will pilot your pod, but I said nothing about a permanent arrangement, sir. Do be aware that I have no intention of making Falsoor my new agent, so any other races you wish me to compete for your company, will have to discussed with Sienn Var when these races come."
Radon shifted his pose, now reflecting the confidence he had in his ability to command his terms with regards to podracing.
"But I do thank you for your company's hospitality, and rest assured that I hold no ill will towards Falsoor for the crash. I will certainly be preparing for the race, and if I may, I ask that you allow me to to practice with the pod you wish me to pilot before the race even begins. There's little worse a racer can do than race an unfamiliar pod."

Ane sighs and looks at her comlink, making a desicion to try to get Radon back. "Rradon, please come with us, Jedi have asked us to all stay togetherr, you'rre amazing with perrsuation we need you to help us.

Back with Alus, she listens to Red Team discuss their strategy.

"Not unless there is something you haven't told us." Ben says with a smile. "Thank you Alus. I think the sooner we get this started the better. Also the quieter the better. So how are we doing this? My thought was Voren and Rith could go in first, and we would pretend to take over for them. Voren and Rith would pass the guards on duty pretending to survey the house. While we distracted them, Rith and Voren, with blasters on stun would take out the guards. Then we strip the guards and lock them up, and run to the Republic Embassy. However, we don't know how many guards there are what the house is like, so this might not work. Alus, do you know anything?"

"That will be fine, Headmaster Doris," Radon accepts. "You have my comlink frequency, so please feel free to contact me if anything comes up. In the meantime, I shall head be grabbing a bite to eat - I haven't had a decent meal since the crash."
Radon sees his commlink beeping soon enough, and so he say, "If you'll excuse me, Headmaster, I have to take this," and so cuts communications with Telares. He receives the call, but this time he gives Awne no response. "*Should've thought of that before you wound your tail tight around the man who shot me,*" he thought with some irritation. Radon simply disconnects, finding the prospect of blocking her frequency out less and less unimaginable. He holds off on that thought again for now.
Taking a deep breath, he exits the communications room and looks for Representative Sheyla, saying, "I would like to have my meal now, please."

Radon hears the beeping sound of his comlink again - it's from Vor'en this time. What was up with everyone? Did they all want to drag him back to his death on Red Team? He struggles on whether to answer the soldier or not. It was very likely that the veteran was with the farghul and that he should ignore the call, but it was just as likely as the man had already went off on his own - there weren't any credits to be made on some fool's errand to free slaves. Radon sighed. He had to give the soldier the benefit of the doubt.
"I hope you're not going to ask me to join you on whatever dangerous assignment you've signed up for, Vor'en. If you are, please drop the transmission and never call me again. If you aren't, then I'll listen to what you have to say."

Lorhas: "Hello Awne, did you manage to reunite with Radon? I can't emphasize enough how important it is that you stay together. You are at too great of security risk seperated. Just stay low until morning, when we can contact you then."
While Awne is talking to Master Lorhas, Woroken pulls out his datapad with blueprints to Alus's house. He observes that there is a guard walking around on the smooth-top roof, and that one guard will definitely have cover to engage them from an elevated position. The second known guard position is just in the front door, where the living room is. The third guard could possibly be in two rooms just after the living room. The fourth will be in room next to the back door. Woroken remembers that these positions are all tentative. But it was better than nothing.

Ben looks over Worken's shoulder at the datapad. "Maybe it's best we try it another way." he says bashfully. "I think our original plan might work better. We take over the shift, and when we either leave before the next shift comes, or wait till they come, stun them unprepared then leave. I know we wanted to get paid, but I think it might be best to avoid all confrontation. Maybe I'm just too soft, but I don't think a few credits justifies killing someone, even if they are scum. So I say we just wait an hour or two, maybe check for and nuetralize any security devices installed in the house then get to the Republic embassy as fast as we can."

She looks at everyone and waves for Rith to join them. He catchs the motion and stands, paying for his drink before walking over. He grabs a chair and sits beside the Farghul asking if they were leaving soon. "Soon Rrith, we'rre worrking out a plan now. I still think it would be best to take ourr shift and do the full 8 hourrs. We can stun the next shift afterr us and steal a speederr if Dex can't find us one. We'll have the upperrhand as they won't be expecting it.

Back at the Falsoor facility, a chromed Z-98 landspeeder with triple turbines and closed cockpit arrives in the area. Sheyla hears the sound outside and looks to Radon.

He looks to see how wide the building is, so people could hide outside. He looks at how many stories there are, and if there are any windows.

Woroken was also in agreement with Awne's plan. It would be simpler to relieve the first guards, and stun the next group a few hours later using better knowledge of their surroundings. The innocent slaves would be less likely to be hit in the crossfire as well. He was ready to go.

Radon responds a little bit exasperated with Vor'en and the rest of Red Team. "Sir, I don't care one bit about good causes - I just want to make sure I live to see tomorrow! And if you're on some wild crusade to change the way things have been on this *planet* for *millenia*, then you're part of the problem, not the solution. Besides, if you're really doing what you're going to do out of some sense of justice, then why did you - all of you - let Rith remain a free man after he tried to *kill* me?!"
He takes a deep breath as Representative Sheyla approaches him. "So don't bother calling me again, you hypocrites," he says in frustration, ending the transmission and finally managing to block both Awne's and Vor'en's frequency. *"Hypocrites,*" he repeats in his mind.
He fakes a smile as Sheyla comes and says, "It appears that your ride has already arrived, you can now meet your lady friends. I trust you will enjoy your time with the company. Good luck on the race."
Radon nods, putting away his comlink and responding, "Yes, I'm sure I will." He walks nonchalantly towards the exit to await the speeder. He starts to lift his hood up, only to chuckle as he realized there wasn't any point to hiding his identity if he was going to be parading around town in a luxury speeder flanked by two Twi'lek escorts.

Bennosuke observes the blueprints very closely. He can't really notice any places for cover in the front door, but he imagines there will definitely be furniture in the house. The shape of the building seems to be that of a thin box, with a smooth rooftop. It doesn't seem to be in the guards favor to stage an ambush. There also seems to be only a few windows on the main level, the only floors being the first and the roof. The windows are on the front and back, just next to the doors. There are two on each side of the building. From the front door, only the first guard would be visible, but the guard on the roof would see them long before they got to the front door. Perhaps more planning was necessary, in an area that is comfortable away from other people.

It appears the passenger side of the luxury speeder is open for Radon. He gets in and immediately notices that the twi'lek behind him is massaging his shoulders.

Woroken also waits for Ben to take point. Having someone who knew the area was a huge advantage.

I need to warn you that being separated from the rest of the survivors is quite dangerous. The reasons you are in danger I can't reveal now.

*Actually, Lorhas' voice is familiar to Radon - he's the one that responded to the distress call back at the wreck.*
Radon quickly notes the personal frequency of the Jedi Master that responded to the crash. Despite his great urge not to have anything to do with Red Team, Radon's slight sense of honor - the reason he still accepted the piloting gig for Falsoor - at least made him listen to what the Master Lorhas had to say.
"Stop the speeder," he told the driver. He then replied on his comlink, saying, "Sir, I have no interest in helping anyone. The only reason the others survived was because it was *me* piloting that wreck of a starship to a survivable crash. And what did I get for the trouble? A blaster to the face from the very man you told your apprentice to release! I thought you Jedi were about justice and all that, so where's the justice for me?"
"Even though I may owe you for saving us from the desert, I can't be certain Rith won't try to kill me again - nor can I be certain that I won't try to kill Rith myself. So you'll just have to forgive me for choosing the danger you can't tell me over the danger I already know. I was born on this planet, so hidden dangers don't scare me as much as the dangers I can see."
He pauses for a bit, trying to think up a way to minimally accede to the Jedi's request. "If you can guarantee my protection, Master Lorhas, I'll do as you ask. Is your apprentice around?"

Lorhas: "I understand your frustration, but his crimes are not unnoticed, we will handle him in our own way. But that man has things about him that are bigger than you could realize now, and I intend to get to the bottom of it. As of right now, I need all of you to try to work together. Once this all over, justice will be served. You will have my protection and that man will be dealt with...you have my word."

The man's conviction was something Radon felt compelled to respond positively to. He didn't know if the man was using Jedi powers on him from so far away, but he found himself relenting. Trust was a fleeting thing on Tatooine, and lifetime trust was the rarest commodity of all; Radon was risking a lot trusting the Jedi Master, but every trusted relationship had to start somewhere. A Jedi was a safe bet, he wagered. At the very least, he'd have a powerful protector.
"Fine. Do know that however important you may think is, I intend to kill him the moment he threatens to take my life again - Force be damned. Tell me where they are, and I'll head straight to them right away, Master Jedi. I hope they're at a cantina; I haven't had a decent meal since Telaras."

After the short pause he began moving again, trying to think of anyplace where he might find someone who might have useful information. A beep from his comlink turned his attention away from his continuing search, 'Lovely...'. Making sure to look as unassuming as possible he pulled out the small device.

"I'll say one thing this the most unusall group I have ever been with." Vor'en looks around and shakes his head smiling." I kind of like it." Vor'en keeps following Ben to the house.

Woroken was definitely torn, as he knew he and the rest of the team could use some rest before the mission, but the anticipation had already began eating at him. He decided to follow the group to the Bantha's Tracks, and get some rest prior to "beginning guard duty." The wookiee was not kidding himself--he knew the he was unlikely to sleep at all, but maybe some resting in the room might do him some good to keep his senses sharp.

### **zerah** (2007-12-12 14:32:56)

Awne and the group head back to the Bantha's Tracks to both rest and wait for Dex to arrive. Stepping through the door Awne turns to the group "Alrright, Ben you have Dex's com frrequency so, when he calls to say he's herre you can come wake the rrest of us. Everryone, lets get some rrest, do what you need to do, I doubt anyone of us is going to sleep while we'rre on shift." She smiles and takes Rith's hand leading the group through the tables and chairs to the staircase at the back.
Moving up she opens the door to the room she had before, taking Rith in with her. He had slept at the hospital the last time and didn't have a room like the others, True she could have let him just go with one of the others but she didn't want him to be out of her sight for too long, Stars only knew what might happen.
Stepping into the room she releases his hand and moves to the beds looking at them then turns to look back at him "Alrright, which one would you like?" She asked him, her hand moving to link the fingers into her belt, her tail curls by her feet.

Rith looks at Awne shortly then pulls off the cloak, the scar oh his chest from Radon's blaster shot still large and perfectly visible. He steps over and pulls Awne closer and wraps her in his arms. His physique was more of an athlete, the group had been unable to tell because of the armor, but the imperial training had done him well. Rith stares into Awne's eyes. "I owe you my life several times over, for that I am grateful."

Awne blushes as she watchs him drop the cloak, her tail stills as she takes in his appearence gulping a little. He steps to her and she shivers, hoping it wasn't noticable when his arms wrap around her. She felt warm being in his arms, she liked the feeling. As he looks into her eyes she looks back into his smiling gently "I would hope that if the tables had been turrned you'd have done the same forr me." Her hands were resting gently on his shoulders. Her fur was soft, to the touch.

Rith stared deeply into the young Farghul's eyes. Awne was shivering, he wondered if she was cold or if it were something else. Rith pulled her closer and placed a gentle hand on the side of her face. The light had yet to be turned on and with all the emotion he had been carrying there were no more words. There was no anger none at this moment, no sadness. Only what he saw before him, this woman had gone through so much for him. Noticing she was still shivering Rith moved in and kissed Awne's lips. He had always been stubborn and head strong. Always rushing into any fight, his anger always guiding him, but not this time. This time it was a different emotion. He had begun to care for her deeply without even realizing it. He held her, his kiss long and soft. As he pulled his lips from Awne's he stared back into her eyes, his hair slightly covering his face, he was smiling for the first time in ages, a real smile.

Vor'en walks into one of the other rooms and takes of his gun belt and slides his side arm under his pillow. Kiucking his boots off, and then taking off his long coat he lays down on the bed and shuts his eyes. "I hope those to get some rest, I would hate to have to have to worry about a fire fight and them at the same time." He looks over at Ben and the Woroken. "I hope you guys don't snore, I need my nest I'm and old man." and with the old soldier goes to sleep.

Awne's heart was beating so loud in her ears she would swear that Rith could hear it. He was kissing her, he was honestly kissing her it wasn't a dream it was real. Her mind was gone, only thing going was telling her that she wanted this man. She wanted him to hold her like this for so much longer, kiss her all the time. Her thoughts were spiraling away as he pulled away to look at her. Her eyes had turned darker in passion, she pulled him back into her and kissed him. More passionate though still gentle.
She pulled him along, never breaking the kiss as she moved back to one of the beds, his hand was moving up her back, a trail of fire burning from each place he touched her. Before she knew it her shirt had gone missing, that wasn't important now, she'd find it later..much, much later. She was panting when she stilled him for a moment "Do you..have something?" He knew what she ment, and he nodded. Pulling out the protection she was asking for from his pants that were by the bed. They were kissing again. Her body was on fire from so much pleasure. The only coherent thought before the finally joined as one, was that she was glad the door was locked.

The wookiee awakes with a slight growl. As he looked around the room, he had to ponder for a second before remembering where he was. Apparently he was able to sleep after all. He had to admit he felt a bit better as well after grabbing a few hours sleep. He thanked Ben for waking him, and slowly began gathering his items together. With a curse under his breath, he realized that he had forgotten to have his spear fixed, during yesterday's dwon time. Since the haft was snapped on the shuttle, he had intended to have craft work done on it. Assuming the party wasn't wanted after the upcoming events, he would have that done.

He steps up to the door and knocks, calling out to them and hopeing they hear. Then he goes downstairs to Voren. He takes a seat at the bar next to Voren.

Awne's ear twitchs at a muffled voice, the noise waking her slightly. She could hear a heartbeat, and she felt warm..and sore. She opens her eyes slowly to see the bare chest and neck of Rith, her arm was wrapped about his waist. She didn't have to look to know he had his arms wrapped tightly around her. She purrs softly, laying her head back down in the crook of his neck, nuzzling the skin gently. She didn't indulge in purring much, not like when she was a kitten and purred at all hours of the day. Her papa had thought it cute, but the other children had teased her about it. Now as an adult she purred when she was truly happy or pleased with something.
She wonders idly why it was she woke up. Her eyes open again as she remembers she heard a voice, *'Ben…it must be time to go.'* She yawns with the thought, and moves to look at Rith. She smiles gently, running her fingertips along his jaw, her tail that was curled around his leg, tightens gently before releasing. She kisses his soft lips, and smiles as she pulls away again "Rrith, it's time to get up, the otherrs arre waiting forr us."

Radon woke up without so much as a yawn. Ever since he was old enough to work, he'd gotten used to sleeping light. It was another of his survival instincts, to wake up active and completely alert the moment a blaster sounded inside the room. The trick served him well during his early days in acting - he'd rarely ever get a full night's rest during heavy days of recording, and the directors were often not the type to want their actors lazing about for early morning takes.
Still, he considered his hygiene. Radon didn't think they needed to be so quick about it that he wouldn't have the time to comb his hair and brush his teeth. As soon as he finished, his good feeling suddenly turned sour when he remembered why he was waking up in the middle of the night in the first place. If it weren't for that Jedi and his meddling apprentice...
Radon gathered his possessions and began to walk towards the door, making sure he had the key to the room with him for proper checking out. He made one last clothing fix in front of the mirror, before putting up the hood of his cloak again. The others weren't aware he was already shadowing them. If he could keep it that way indefinitely, he would very much love that. The Jedi Master only said he needed to be with the rest - not to actually participate in whatever it is they were going to do, or for them to even know he was there.

Rith opens his eyes to the Farghul, her tail wrapped tightly around his leg. Her kiss was soft and gentle. What an amazing night that had been he thought. He lay for a short while longer holding Awne in his arms then with reluctance sat up and began searching for his clothes. As he stood putting his clothes back on he stared at the young Farghul, how could someone have so much of an influence on him. For the time he had been with her that night his anger had subsided to no more than a whisper in the back of his mind. As he placed his cloak on once again Rith stepped back over to Awne and wrapped her in his arms again. He kissed her again with a softness unbecoming of his former rage. "Lets get this done Awne." With that Rith stood until she was ready then they strode out of the room together to meet up with the rest of the party.

He was not going to let this night be the last with Awne. Rith squeezes Awnes hand and looked at her to let her know that he was about to let his anger return. Rith, after nodding to Awne, lets go of her hand and the anger returns, though his caring for Awne remained, his anger had taken over. "I need a vibro blade, a BIG one."

Ben smiled to himself, he had an answer. "Actually, it would be best if we don't kill them." Ben said. "Realize that slavery on this planet is legal. By killing the guards we would be breaking more laws and techniquly putting the slaves in more danger. By breaking less laws we make the republic's job easier in keeping them safe and free. Hopefully Voren can devise a way to ambush these guys so that a real fight isn't even neccesary. Then all we have to do is stun them and lock them up somewhere.

" You heard the lady boys lets get moving." Vor'en picks up his E-11 and heads for the door. "Ben you know the way you lead." Pulling out a cigar and lighting it as he 's walking Vor'en looks down at the datapad once and awhile figueing out what they should do.

*Bennosuke's Perception 8+4=11; Radon's Deception 8+5+16=29. Once again Radon, keep this number. Vor'en deduct 5 credits from your sheet. Luckily Bantha Track's accepts credits and not just truguts.*
Red Team exits the bar/hotel and begins moving towards the direction of Alus's house. It is not a very far distance at all, as the settlement is not very large to begin with. Bennosuke keeps a watchful eye out for the group as they move through the scarcely populated streets, but he never sees anything suspicious. It would seem everyone has went indoors, probably due to the fact that no one was trading or selling anything. Woroken keeps his datapad out guiding Red Team to the target building.
The party treks on for about five minutes, and suddenly Vor'en signals for the party to stop. Red Team freezes in place not doubting the veteran's instincts. He points to an alley to the left of the group, and everyone seemingly dissappears into the shadows. Everyone kneels in the shadows looking around for anything suspicious. Rith and Vor'en exchange some tactical information. Then Rith and Vor'en point out that the building is within 100 meters and is now visible. It is northeast of your current position and you can see it is seemingly isolated from the rest of the buildings. *Perception checks if you want more details of the slave house.*

Awne follows her boys, sticking next to Rith as they walked. She shivers and crosses her arms in front of her, "Firrst it's too hot now it's too cold, dammit doesn't this planet have a middle grround??" she mutters under her breath, gradualy moving closer to Rith for more heat, her tail finding a loop in Vor'ens clothes and uses it to pull him closer to her other side so she had body heat from both. She sighs as she walks, looking down at her clothes. She was use to a more moderate temperature, if her clothes her anything to go by, tight shirt with her midriff showing, tight pants with a short skirt over and boots. Yea..she wasn't prepared for this kind of weather. *'Note to self: get warrmerr clothes orr at least a nice all-purrpose cloak'*
At the signal from Vor'en, Awne's thoughts of shopping stop and switch to survival. She ducks into the alley with everyone else and looks to the house. Then a thought hits her and she sighs at the men "Why arre we stopping? They'rre expecting us."

Woroken puts away his datapad once the house was in sight. Before the group moves any closer, he takes a good long look at the house as well as the surrounding area. He wanted to wait for the "safe to proceed" signal from Ben and Vor'en before approaching closer.

*Actually, without electrobinoculars, you will be all the negatives with your perception checks at 100 meters. You would need to get closer, but you don't know what the guards have and if they might spot you. I stopped the party so you could plan out your next move without getting spotted, Vor'en and Rith realized this was a good place to scout.*

Noticing that Vor'en had been spotted Woroken began slowly moving in that direction. He wanted teh current guards to see there were other guards than just Vor'en, and wanted to begin moving out into the open, hoping to avoid a confrontation with them at this time. "Probably wouldn't look good if they saw all of us trying to hide," the wookie thought as he walked.

Vor'en studies the slave house hard, and he can only see the one guard on the roof. He realizes if they were to be ambushed, the guard on the roof would be a challenge as he is covering the whole team from an elevated position. It would be difficult to kill him unless they had some explosives. Also, he did not like being surrounded by buildings, that means any enemies could attack them from windows. They could also be flanked from any alley way if they wanted to attack bad enough. Actually going into the target building was a nightmare in itself, as the enemy would likely have the jump on them.

Woroken moves quickly to get behind Awne as she opens the door.

Vor'en observes the front of the house, it is a rectangular building. There is only one glassless window in the front and a door. Awne walks past Vo'ren and looks into the doorway. Awne only sees the main room of the house, and one human guard sitting in a chair next to a wall. The room is very desolate looking and the sand serves for a floor. There is very little furniture, and if there is any, it is comprised of old wood. The guard dressed in worn and torn clothes stands, his bandolier looking about the newest thing on his body. He carries a seemingly state of the art rifle though...*Knowledge tactics.*This reinforces the fact they are weapons for hire, all their money was invested in weapons and nothing else.

Woroken takes over the main room, which appears to be the living room judging by the worn out furniture. Vor'en has now gotten in place on the roof, with a good overview of the settlement. Bennosuke goes back to the room just past the stairs, in the back of the main room. He notices the room is completely dark, he flicks a light switch on and he can see beds spread out in the tiny room. There are four kids underneath ragged blankets.

Ben looks in the room cautiously. All he can see is a shelf that has been neatly organized and squared with the rest of the room, they seem to have picked up in here.

The room is small and it has a door, the back door of this house obviously. There is a generator of some type in here with crates stacked up against the wall, almost to the ceiling.

" Oh ya, tell everyone open coms so we can stay in contact." Putting his com away and going over the details he thinks. "Should be able to do this when we need to."

Vor'en tries to remember to his days of being a stormtrooper, but can't quite remember on how to garrison a building effectively. He remember that their lieutenant always worried about that, and he just barked out orders to the other troops for the officer. Well, he knew as long as someone stayed on the roof they'd be covered from every direction, but more eyes on the roof would be good. This would help to see anyone going into the building. He also knew that every member needed to have a comlink operational and communications needed to be frequent between teammates if they got into a firefight.

Radon's disguise seemed to have worked. Red Team hadn't been alerted to his presence so far. He'd managed to walk just behind them enough to escape casual notice and follow them discreetly through the near-empty streets, but as soon as they began to relieve the guards in the house they intended to go to, he knew it would only be a matter of time before one of Red Team began looking around in earnest. He ducked in an alleyway, keeping close to the wall, trying to blend his drab cloak in the shadows of the dark as he kept watch on the house. It kind of reminded him of his one spy movie, but unlike then, however, this was the real deal, and he was far closer to the danger zone than he was normally comfortable with. The Jedi Master owed him - big time.

Dexer gets low on top of the roof and begins visually scanning the area around the building. He spots people going about their business and he can even see into some of the buildings that have lit interiors. However, something suspicious catches his eye, he sees a hooded figure in the shadows of one alley watching them. It might be something they want to check out. Dexer notices something else out of place, there is someone in an adjacent alley watching the hooded figure. He appears to be the trandoshan from the Bantha Track's! The trandoshan looks from left to right, then at the building Red Team is on. He seems to be studying it. After a few seconds, he disappears behind the building. Vor'en, on the other hand, scans with his eyes but can see nothing but walking around.

Rith leans against the wall in the small room, he glanced at the hulking wookie standing across from him then pulled out his comm. "Voren, when are we gonna do this?" "It needs to be soon while we still have the cover of dark." "Also we need to remember that blasters are loud and if we get into a firefight here we are gonna end up way worse off." Rith looked at the small blaster Awne had given him, he had wanted a blade but this would have to do for now. He would fashion a blade for himself later. One that reflected his anger and rage. "Whenever your ready Voren."

Bennosuke moves very stealthfully out the back door of the slave house. When he exits, he can see the large duracrete wall that surrounds the settlement about 150 meters way. This house was obviously next to the barrier of Mos Esre that kept hostile creatures out. There was no other buildings behind this one. Bennosuke walks to the right corner of the house and peers around. In the distance he can see scattered amounts of people walking around in the moonlight, none of them seems to be doing anything suspicious.

Vor'en sees that it'll be possible to watch the group from the roof as long as they stay in the open. But being in the open meant anyone could see them. Because it was dark, it would be harder to keep eyes on Red Team. He remembered that in an urban combat situation it was always good to have at least two people in an elevated position to have eyes over the battlefield, but comm must always be maintained with the overwatch, and you could never get too far away from the people watching. He also realized that this was a settlement, and not as hostile as a battlefield. It would be wise to look as nonchalant as possible while moving the kids to safety, he didn't want any of Bordo's thugs to take notice of Red Team. It would be wise to keep weapons lowered and to not look like they are in a security posture.

Something was definitely up. From his distant vantage point, he couldn't tell what exactly was going on in that house, but he was surely certain that something was up. Were the others already on the move? Were they now attempting to free the slaves? He wondered why they seemed to be acting so quickly. Radon tried to get a good look around while keeping himself from moving as much as possible. What did Red Team see? It might've been him, he admits, but a randomly cloaked figure isn't all that suspicious in Tatooine. Then again, besides himself, only Ben and maybe that Dexer guy were from around these parts. What was going on? Perhaps, regretfully, why did he choose to be in the middle of it?
And why did he have so many questions? That was never a good sign.

Outside of the house, in the alley between a few small houses, Radon quietly observes the house. He can see a shadowy figure on top of the roof, but that is about it. He can see the lights on but he cannot see movement in the house. It was quite hard to see in the dark and at this distance.

"*Too dark,*" Radon mutters under his breath.
He could only make out a person on top of the house, and if he knew Red Team any, that would probably be Vor'en the veteran. It certainly seemed like the rest had the situation completely under control, so that was a relief. He just needed to stay where he was, not making a sound or a move, until such time that Red Team left the building. Perhaps it would be an easy favor to complete, after all. He wouldn't let himself become complacent, however. No, definitely not complacent. Radon began to check his vicinity, making sure his 'back way out' remained clear, should anything untoward happen that he'd need a quick exit for.

Bennosuke observes the hooded-man sneezing. He thought this was strange, this is the place where he thought he had seen something move earlier. Perhaps more investigation was in order. He noticed that the buildings around him were quieting down, and the lights were being turned off. It seemed that most people were going to bed, and very few people were treading the streets. The moonlight was very bright, as usual, and there was no cloud cover. So the alleys had good shadows to shroud movement. Bennosuke started to question the hooded-man when he heard a voice.
Voice: "Hey you! I'd like to welcome you into Bordo's circle the right way!"
Bennosuke turns and notices that it was the scruffy old gangster known as Kex, and he was approaching him swiftly with three other people. It was two humans and a Duros, they seemed armed with slung rifles and typical bandoliers that all Bordo's men had been using.
Kex: "Hey man, we bought your shift a round of Sith Spit's to welcome you into our happy family. What are you doing away from the house anyways?"
The men motion their hands showing they got drinks for everyone, they seem to be in a jovial mood. It was obvious they had a few drinks already.

Radon curses himself inwardly for having a sensitive nose at this point. Thankfully, it was Ben that decided to drop by, and in case the other native saw him under the hood, Ben would be the one most understanding of Radon's spying. It was just chance then that a group that identified themselves as Bordo's thugs came along - even though they seemed inebriated and acted friendly, they were still a danger that he wanted, no, *needed* to avoid. On the other hand, what was he going to do about Ben?
"*Why'd he have to be so damn thorough, anyway?*" he thinks, but with that thought comes a plan.
"Okay, I think I got it now. Let me just record the directions you gave me so I don't forget it along the way and get lost for hours again," he says, using his voice to give himself away to Ben but not to the thugs. He takes out his comlink and his audiorecorder, plugging one into the other, and continues his impromptu performance. "Now... which one's the recorder again? Ah, nevermind, I'll just switch 'em both on."
He does so, making sure to act like a forgetful fool. In the meantime, he also makes sure to dial in Woroken's frequency, beginning a covert transmission. "Start recording. Day 2. Directions to Racer's Bend cantina. Start by walking down the road, heading right at the intersection..." he begins his oration, hoping the Wookiee was tuned in. A couple more sentences later, he finished with: "... and taking the third left after that. Don't get lost, and don't forget to pay your tab. End recording."
Radon paused momentarily, and bowed slightly to Ben. "Thanks again for the directions, uh, Ben, was it?" he 'asked', knowing fully well that he was still transmitting. "Alright, I'll be following your directions now. I hope you and your friends here enjoy your drinks."
He begins to walk the way out of the alley, clearly muttering "Now, where's that rewind button again? Aw, shoot, at this rate I'll get lost again..."

Kex: "Show us your dedication by having a little fun with this poor sap."
The Duros thug puts his drinks down and steps in front of Radon, crossing his arms.
Meanwhile, Woroken receives the whole transmission from Radon. Everyone around Woroken can also hear the conversation.

This is Worroken and Rrith." she says pointing to each person. She turns to the two men "I'll be back, keep them in herre." She then leaves through the door to the 'front door' Walking outside she looks at the men, her tail curls by her feet, as she places a hand on her hip looking for Ben in the dark "Ben?"

Radon's transmission had confused the wookiee. Radon was a home lander, so he clearly did not need directions to a place he had already visited. It seemed the most important thing about the transmission was that Ben and Radon were speaking--Ben was outside their current location. Awne was quick to volunteer to go look for the two. Woroken made a what he hoped was a funny face at one of the kids, trying to keep them entertained until Awne returned. Woroken kept his com on to monitor any further conversations.

Awne walks the short distance to the alley from the slave house. She sees Ben and a hooded-figure dealing with four thugs. A Duros thug is pushing the hooded-man around. The other thugs are laughing at the scene. Kex looks at Awne approaching the area.
Kex: "Why are you leaving your post...? Hey, want to get in on this?! One of you give him a good beating, show yourself to Bordo, teach him what we do to stupid people in our settlement."
Kex also notices someone screaming from the roof.
Kex: "What the..? What's going on up there?"

We were going to run away wit the kids, demolish this house, and sell the kids for more money then Bordo would ever pay us. I have a friend in the Bleeding Wampas, back in Mos Ires who would pay top dollar for kid servents. He likes to *play with them.* Plus he has an agenda with Bordo. This would have been perfect. However, you start firing, and that *fool out there*, who is a demolition expert will fire the kilo of detonite he wired to the house. What do you think I was actually giving him directions?

Woroken uncurls the youngster from around his leg, and sticks his tongue out one more time at the kid for good measure, drawing a laugh for his efforts. "Hey, maybe I have more of a knack for this that I thought, "he considered, laughing at the thought. Woroken had always been a softie, especially for a wookiee.
Back to busines, Woroken walks outside, observes the scene, and tell Ben, "What now, boss? Seems like you and Vor'en have the situation in hand." He had heard all the action on the com and was happy things worked out for both the group and for Ben--maybe this would be a confidence booster he needed.
The wookie took the blasters from the thugs. "Ben, we cannot harm these men, as they surrendered willingly to us. To hurt them now would be barbaric. Let's get them inside, out of view. We can tie them up, and get the kids out now. When the next group comes in, they can discover these guys, long after we are gone."

Ben's heart leaps when the deception works. Thank god they were able to avoid a confrontation."Thank you for the offer, but after doing this, I don't think Bordo will trust me too much. Besides, after this mission is over, I won't have to work for a long time. But thank you, I guess I am honored." Ben thinks for a second and has an idea. "But I'll tell you this, because Bordo will want to know. I'm just a hired hand so I don't mind telling you. The Bleeding Wampas want in on Bordo's territory. And they mean buisness. They plan to strike soon since Bordo doesn't know they are gunning for him. If he's smart he'll find some way to dismantle the swoop gang before they can organize another hit. The new head of the group is a hot shot and a dangerous guy, named Kix Styre. If you remove him, the gang will become less dangerous." Ben felt bad bringing the Wampas into this. But Kix Styre was a dangerous man, and the one who killed Ben's family. If Kix was removed the Wampas would become a far less dangerous, and possibly a more productive group.
*Sorry it took so long. I was spending time with the family.*

Kex: "Trust may be an issue at first, but only at first. I'd say it'd be worth the risk,someone with your obvious talents. The pay would be enough to keep you around. Even more than that, since you gave us information on Kix, perhaps you could work with us to take him down? You would probably be put in charge of the ordeal. Nevertheless, we're not sure if we will occupy this settlement permanently, it is strictly tentative. If you want to work with us, I can give you some contact information.

The thugs go for holsters on their thighs...

The front door window could look out into the combat. Radon you are about 10 squares away from the fight in an alley.

*"Idiot!"* Radon screams in his mind right after mentally patting Ben on the back for the astounding speech. If he didn't know any better, the podracer would say that the other native was a no-good scumbag himself - then the fiasco happened.
*"You don't try to shoot someone* before *you've taken away their blasters!"* he found himself internally yelling. For Radon, that was just one of the hard lessons learned living in Mos Espa. Apparently Ben hadn't learned that one in Mos Ires.
"Great..." he muttered, as he dropped prone to the ground for safety. "Why do these things always happen to us?"
Drawing his blaster, Radon drew a bead on the apparent leader, trying to make sure neither Ben nor Woroken were in his line of fire. He wasn't certain he could hit the guy, but he would try to make sure someone else would... but why was he pulling the trigger at all? Why wasn't he running?
"Oh, right... last time I do a favor for a Jedi Master," he muttered under his breath.

Woroken and Bennosuke flinch as Kex quickly draws his blaster pistol from his thigh holster. He brings his pistol up to Bennosuke's chest level and fires. The blaster bolt cracks the night air and immediately strikes the extreme right side of Bennosuke's chest. *Attack Breakdown: Kex's to hit is 16 beats your flat-footed Dex. You take 16 damage.

Bennosuke grimaces in pain as he aligns his blaster carbine sights quickly on Kex, dropping into a low-standing position. He fires a stun bolt at the Thug Leader, quickly returning fire. The stun bolt strikes Kex square in the stomach, but it barely phases him.

It was times like these he really liked, a big fat juicy target in your sights. Vor'en took a slow puff of his cigar and fired. He saw the blaster bolt strike the thug to the left of Kex, and he saw his body fall. *50 Experience Vor'en*

Dexer hugs the wall close, pulling out his blaster pistol. He peeks just barely around the corner to survey the happenings. He can see Bennosuke just ahead and to the left, behind a junk pile. Woroken is squaring off with the thugs to the right and forward of Bennosuke's position. From this point, Dexer could take cover behind the junk pile that Bennosuke is behind. Other than that, the building he is at now is the only other good place to stay in cover.

The thugs react to Kex's orders by moving a short distance to a junk pile to the southeast. Anyone outside that is watching the thugs see them disappear behind the junk. The junk pile is in a straight line about seven squares away from the slave house. Once they are out of sight, they seemed to have stopped shooting.
Thug: "Prepping frag grenade Kex, give us some covering fire!"
Kex: "Gotcha, turn these morons into bantha poodoo!"

Woroken and Kex are still squaring off against each other as the thugs moved to cover. It seems Kex is covering his men so they can get to safety. Kex is obviously in the open, trying to get the group's attention.

*Radon you do have LOS. You are in a alley in the main crop of buildings behind the thugs in the junkpile. Basically, the battlefield is broken down into five portions right now. There is everyone inside the house. There is Vor'en on the roof. Dexer is behind the slave building on the corner. Woroken, Kex, and the thugs are in the opening between the house and the main crop of buildings. Radon is in the alley where the main crop of buildings are located, so you can see the backs of the thugs behind the junk pile. They seem to be unaware of Radon still being there.*

*Woro, you must state one attack you are using and that is the only attack you can use, regardless if you hit them easily or not. Also, I don't know if your spear is out but I'm going to give it to you without the expense of a move action. Everyone in the game needs to be very clear about weapons being drawn, if you think combat is approaching, make it obvious that you have your weapon out. Woroken's Melee Attack 9+7=16. Woroken gains 50 experience.*
Woroken takes a couple of steps forward into the sand and hops in Kex's direction. While he is hopping this short distance, he uses the momentum to thrust his spear tip forward. Kex is shocked by Woroken's aggressive speed, and is incapable of avoiding the spear. The spear pierces Kex's stomach cleanly and it is obvious the wookiee struck a mortal blow. Woroken holds the spear as it is the only thing holding Kex upright. He then kicks Kex's body off the spear and Kex collapses into the sand.

When Ben hears the thugs talk about using a grenade Ben's mind races. He peers past his cover to see Woroken subduing Kex with his spear, and spasms in pain from his wound. If only he had his own grenades with him. But he had to calm himself and fight past this pain. *Ben uses a swift action to take a second wind.*
Now he had to engage the thugs at whatever cost. Ben runs out of cover so that he breaks the thugs' cover and opens fire on the thug holding the grenade. If both are he shoots the closest one. *Attack +4 and a force point.*

Radon's hand quickly went to his holster, and he drew it out as he ducked his head down. He noticed the other thugs heading his way, making him start sweating a bit, as that was definitely *not* where he wanted to be. That momentary anxiety quickly disappeared as he saw them go behind some junk in the alley and turn completely around. The moment he heard the words 'frag grenade', his heart stopped.
It was then that something in him clicked, like two ends of a long-ago cut thread touching for the first time. For that brief moment of clarity, it dawned on Radon what had to be done - despite the great danger to himself. He didn't know what came over him, but whatever it was, it felt right.
He locked his eyes on the unaware thugs ahead of him, and raised his blaster. A frag grenade was going to explode, all right, but not on Red Team.

Admist the loud blaster fire, Ben draws in a breath and focuses with every bit of his mental energy. *Bennosuke regains 10 hp, putting him at 26 hp.* He can feel a surge of power throughout his muscles as he moves forward to the enemies covered position. Ben brings his weapon sights up to the thug hiding behind cover, the thug just notices Ben as he fires. *Bennosuke's Ranged Attack 2+4=6*
The blaster bolt shoots past the thug and thumps the sand beside him, kicking up a cloud of dust. The thug looks as he had just seen a ghost.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 2)

Vor'en observes the fighting underneath him as he searches for his next target. He just watched Kex fall at Woroken's hands, and he knows the thugs took cover behind a junk pile. He can see just enough of one of their backs through a pile of junk to make a shot. *Vor'en's ranged attack 19+8=27; Vor'en gains 50 experience.* . Vor'en takes a shot and it appears as if the thug has slumped behind the junk pile.
Meanwhile, Bennosuke is looking right into the eyes of the thug as a blaster bolt tears through his chest, the man stares blankly as he collapses over. When he hits the sand, a fragmentation grenade rolls out of his hand. The other thug turns and looks at Bennosuke, with comlink in hand.

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-12-22 16:23:37)

*Well, it will take more than one turn to reach a good vantage point, the best being the roof. Everywhere else is just a wide open space, or a junk pile.*
Dexer hears the gunfire begin to die down, and the shouting between the thugs seem nonexistent. He didn't see everything but he assumed that Red Team was winning this fight, and he wasn't sure if anyone in Red Team was hurt either. *Dexer's Perception Check 7+2=9.* Dexer peeks around the corner and all he can see is Bennosuke squaring off with a thug behind a junk pile. He looks beyond Ben's position looking in the main crop of buildings, it seems that people have thinned out in this area due to the gunfight. So he estimates that Vor'en will see someone running down the alley if thugs are coming and that maybe he needs to contact him with these facts.

The thug right next to Bennosuke looks him in the eyes as he drops the comlink. He pulls out his blaster pistol from his thigh holster and desperately brings it up to shoot at Bennosuke. *Thugs ranged attack 15+1=16; Bennosuke takes 7 damage.* The blaster bolt travels quickly and skims his thigh, burning him. Bennosuke can hear a desperate voice on the dropped comlink but he cannot determine what the person is saying.

lunges forward, with the sharp end of the spear aiming for his neck. *Woroken's Melee Attack 2+7=9. You are in an unoccupied space to the right of the thug.* The spear swings wide as the thug quickly jerks his head to avoid the strike. The thug seems very scared as he is now going against three assailants.

Radon sees the grenade drop from one dead man's hand, and watches as the wookiee's legendary battle prowess cowers the thug. His moment of focus passes, and soon he finds bravado fleeing from his spirit. His breath grows heavy with panic once more, panic at the ensuing chaos Red Team has unleashed on this otherwise quiet part of Mos Esre. The ruckus has surely woken up the neighborhood, and if they wanted to complete that mission they undertook upon themselves, it was time for them to leave.
He steps up further into the alleyway, telling Woroken through the still open link of their comms, "I'm at the other end of the alleyway. I'm coming in to secure the grenade, but we better get out of here soon - we've already attracted the wrong kind of attention."
With that, he steps into the wookiee's sight, pointing his blaster down non-threateningly and his palm up in a "halt" gesture. He proceeds to the wayward grenade, picking it up and making sure it's safely disarmed before stowing it away in his pocket. He then gestures for Woroken to stay quiet. He points to the thug's dropped comlink, making the wookiee aware that someone might be listening in.

Radon examines the fragmentation grenade to discover that it isn't armed. The comlink is still on and there is no traffic on the net. The thug just watches Radon the whole time, keeping his arms in the air.

*I assume we're no longer in combat. Ignore if otherwise.*
The actor, still in disguise, finally turns off his own comlink. Instead of replying immediately to the thug, he steps toward the comlink, and picks it up. Holding it up, he plays the thug's game, one he himself had played earlier on. He sets his blaster to stun, making sure the ominous click is heard by whoever is listening in before he points it towards the surrendered thug. "There's a new power in Mos Esre," he modulates gravely, using a voice not his own. He pulls the trigger once and only once near the scum's feet, then quickly turns off the comlink to finish the performance.
Nodding his already shadowy hood towards the thug, he says, "Now Bordo and his men think you are dead along with the rest. If you go back to them, he will no doubt have you killed for your cowardice anyway. If you try to leave the city, the Hutt will find out for certain and send bounty hunters after your head - which, at this point, isn't worth all that much." Radon lifts his head just a bit to stare down the thug with his two-tone eyes. "But if you help us escape and avoid capture, we can make sure you are put in a place where Bordo cannot touch you. The choice is easy, is it not?."

Of course, it was securely in his mind that the safest place for the thug to be at this point was in a Republic prison cell, but he didn't need to know that at this time. All he needed to know is that he wasn't going to be any safer than being with Red Team. "And if you try again, my wookiee colleague here will make sure you don't try anything ever again," he finished.
Turning to Vor'en and Ben, he said, "The faster we get out of here, the better."

Woroken clasps tightly around the shoulder of the thug in an intimidating gesture, backing up Radon's description of a threat. Growling in what he hopes is a menacing tone, he releases the thug with a warning glance.
Woroken then takes a quick glance at Ben's injuries. He had taken a direct hit, but appeared to be okay, for now. Woroken tells Ben that he will treat his injuries directly, but it would be better to get out of the street now, before they were discovered. Hopefully, after arriving at their destination, there would be plenty of time for healing.

To be honest, Ben didn't know how he had survived two direct blaster bolts to the chest, but he wasn't going to complain. Ben grabs his datapad from his belt and pulls up the navigation system.

Thug:" Ok, we are headed to the cantina then. But the reserve men are taking a direct route through the settlement to here, they will be using the main street more than likely. So we should take the back alleys. Is this everyone? We don't have much time. "
The thug looks at the main street as it seemed everyone has cleared the area, then he looks back down at his fallen compatriot. He looked up at Radon and awaits an answer. The little boy looks at the fallen thug. He then tugs at Awne.
Boy: "Is he sleeping?"

Awne looks down at the little boy tugging at her tail, at his question she looks to the fallen thug. She bites her lip and looks at the group then crouches down to the the boys eye-level "Yes..He's sleeping a verry deep and long sleep, so it's best not to wake him orr any of the otherrs you see on the grround sleeping, ok?"

The thug looks at the kid and gets a sad look on his face. Then he looks around desperately.
Thug: "Is this everyone? We have to leave soon if you want to avoid the men."

Woroken nods at the thug, that indeed it was time to get out of the area. The wookiee gestures for the man to lead on, following close behind.

" Lead the way my freind." Vor'en says while checking the charge on his E-11. "And remeber any funny business and it might take awhile for me to stop my Wookie friend here from ripping your arms off." Vor'en says making sure the thug understands his statement. "I will help cover the middle with the Anwe and the kids, everyone file in and lets get moving."
(OCC What did we find when we cleaned up the blasters and other stuff. AKA looting the bodys.)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-15 16:55:42)

Vor'en searches the bodies quickly. He also gathers the items that have been dropped on the ground. He collects a total of four fragmentation grenades, four blaster pistols, four blaster rifles, three short range comlinks, and 3 padded chest rigs. As he does this, the thug seems to have a growing look of sadness on his face.
Thug: "We've waited here long enough, if you want to avoid further death I suggest we leave now. We are headed to the Racer's Bend Cantina, but watch out, Bordo's men will definitely be on high alert. It would be best to get rid of all contraband and to not look suspicious."
The entire Red Team assembles on Vor'en's command. The kids mix into the center of the formation, some are trying to help push the hovering crates. The thug takes point on the formation and leads the group through some windy and desolate alleyways. Most of the lights in the windows have been turned off. Everyone has cleared the streets, which either meant everyone was sleeping or everyone knew there was going to be a fight. After a ten minute brisk walk, you see the welcoming sign overhanging the entrance to Racer's Bend.
The thug walks through the tan sliding door and quickly scans the cantina. The holovids seemed to have been powered down and you can see a protocol droid doing procedures to close the bar down. The patrons have all vanished, minus a very drunk one sitting at a bar stool. It is about one thirty, and you are unsure if the place normally closes at this time. The thug looks back at the group.
Thug: "So what did you guys want to do? Did you want to get a room for the night? We should be relatively ok in here, the droid won't say too much about you guys being here."
*Your characters are fairly tired as you didn't get a whole lot of rest before this operation, especially Rith and Awne. Please let me know how you guys are distributing the fallen thug's items so I may put them on the character sheets accordingly.*

Woroken addresses Ben and Radon for expediency's sake. "Guys, all I could really use is a couple of the grenades. I think we should sell what excess items there are, and buy a medkit. I can keep patching us up with our medpacs, but if we get hit hard, I need a kit to keep us running." The large wookiee thought for a bit and suggested that Awne take the kids to a room to get some rest. The rest of the team could stand watch and keep the thug occupied.

### **ganthet** (2008-01-16 00:54:08)

"I'm going to take one of the blaster rifles, then rest can be divided up or sold don't really care." "Radon if you need a blaster go ahead and take one." "Barkeep I need to rooms for the night, close together." "Anwe, Radon and Wroken take the kids in one and the rest in the other." Looking at the thug. " I am not letting you out of my site." "Well everyone lets go up stairs and get some sleep tomorrow comes early." With that Vor'en leads there new friend to the rooms for the night.

Awne leans against Vor'en a moment as he was the closest, her eyes slipping closed a moment, before she jerks herself back awake, her tail whipping up to help steady her quickly. She shakes her head at the soldiers orders and whispers to him "The Jedi wanted to meet us this morning, we should keep moving." She looks at the others, and the kids seeing how they were. She looks around for Rith, wanting him to be beside her.

*The protocol droid informed the group that persons lodging in the rooms is 15 credits or truguts a piece. The four kids could stay for free.* 
Vor'en walks into one of the rooms in the upstairs area of Racer's Bend. He notices the rooms are very similar to the Bantha Track's they stayed in before. He stacks the equipment up in a pile and decides how to disperse them throughout Red Team. *Knowledge Tactics to identify the weapons. Everyone please tell me what you are doing and if you are going to rest or not. Tell me who pays for what and who takes what equipment.*

Woroken, remembering his nap was so quickly interrupted at the "slave house" decides he will take an early shift of sleeping. Yawning, he hands Ben his cred stick and asks if he would mind settling up with the proprietor, getting rooms for everyone. "I just don't have the energy to go through the translation right now," he sighs, plopping into a nearby chair. "Just bring me back what's left..."

The four small children seem exhausted themselves. However, they also seem a little on edge. The four kids climb into a bed in Awne's room and they all talk for a little while, trying to go to sleep.

"Thanks Ben," the wookiee tells the human. "I will tend to your wounds after we get everyone situated in the rooms."
Remembering the bounty taken from the thugs, Woroken quickly grabs two of the frag grenades and puts them in his utility belt.

Awne follows the kids into the room smiling at them and helping them to get into a bed, "Alrright little one's best to rrest a while, sleep if you can. Stay in herre alrright?" She walks over to the other bed and takes a seat, sighing as she runs a hand through her hair.

The protocol droid nods politely as he accepts the credits from Bennosuke.
Protocol Droid: "Enjoy your stay at the Racer's Bend sir, would you like a wake up call?"
*Deduct 75 credits, as I'm not sure what characters are going to lodge because they aren't posting. Woroken, I will add the two frags to your character sheet. All of you tell me who is going to rest and who isn't.*

Before heading to bed Vor'en looks over the weapons that they found. "Most of this stuff should fetch agood price around here." "I think I might keep one never know when it might come in handy."
Looking over at the thug that they brought with them. " You are going to have to find another line of work and get off this rock." "You buddys aren't going to like what you did. Makes no never mind to me but when we get these kids to there family I will cut you loose and you can go about what you want." "I would give up on the hired gun business unless you want to help out the local security forces here." " Up to you. Well I am going to get some sleep and don't worry I will be removing the blaster packs from the weapons wouldn't want anything to happen while i was asleep." Vor'en removes the blaster packs from the weapons they got from the thugs and has Ben tie up there neew friend. Then takes off his blast vest and lays down to get some sleep after putting his blaster pistol under his pillow.
(OCC Knowledge Tactics 8 + d20 to which one of the blaster rifles is the best. I will take 10 if I have to.)

Thug: "I suppose your right, today was a horrible day...I watch my friends destroyed in front of my eyes."
The man watches Vor'en lay down.
Thug: "My name is Loyd by the way, and I don't think I'll be getting any rest."
*Vor'en, exactly what items are you keeping? I'll put whatever you list on your character sheet.*
Loyd walks to the door of Vor'en's room and looks into the hall, he seems bothered.
*Vor'en is now asleep.*

*Vor'en's Knowledge Check 10+6=16, and he gains 50 experience points. There are 3 pistols left, 3 rifles left, 4 blast vests, and 4 short-range comlink's left over to sell. They sit in a pile in Vor'en's room.*
Before Vor'en went to bed, he put two fragmentation grenades out of the pile of equipment and put it in his item pack. He took a look at the blaster rifles and identified them all as Kashnir Arms KX-60 Blaster rifles. They are just standard blaster rifles, with decent power, and they see much use in police forces and small miltias. They are fitted with scopes for accuracy at further distances. Due to the nature of this weapon, they are restricted on civilized planets. Awne took a pistol and holster to her items.
Red Team, and the four small children sleep peacefully. A small chime pierces the darkness of Awne's sleep.

Awne rises from her warm bed and notices that the twin suns are out. She checks the time and it is 10:11 am. The kids are sleeping soundly wrapped in their blankets. Her comlink is beeping, and something seems amiss. But everything seems fine in this room. Awne has a nagging sense, that feeling she can't explain, that someone in Red Team is missing.
