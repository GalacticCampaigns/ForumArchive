# [Heart Of Shadow] Chapter 3 Unknown location/Vor'en's thread

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-13 16:56:08)

Vor'en wakes up violently as ice-cold water stings his face. He is sitting in a plasteel chair with hands bound by binder cuffs behind him. There are two power conduit lines wrapped around him, the energy ends are digging into his side. The room smelled dirty and the ground/room was made of hardened sand like typical Tatooine buildings. He was facing a computer console with hundreds of blinking buttons. He saw a face he didn't think he'd see again. It was the green-skinned Rodian, Deeluk. He was dressed in brown-ragged clothes and bandolier. He had a blaster pistol on his thigh.
Deeluk: "Hello employee, why'd you quit? Not enough benefits for ya? Might as well get comfortable, if you can."
Vor'en realizes this is a very small room, his equipment is gone, he has no armor, and his friends are nowhere in sight.

"Whats the matter comlink broke." Vor'en looks up at his captor. "You better hope I don't get out of this or your dead." "And trust me there are people looking for me." He looks around to see if Rith and Anwe where there. "If you have hurt my friends there will be no force in the galaxy to prevent me from killing every last one of you."

Vor'en watches as poorly dressed human walks in, he grabs something out of the corner...and Vor'en is shocked what it is....

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-13 17:09:51)

The human picks up a burnt corpse from the corner, and it is....Bennosuke.
Deeluk looks at Vor'en and smiles.
Deeluk: "I'll do the talking here, and you'll respond when I ask for it."

"Sithspawn!!" "He was just a kid, his whole life ahead of him!!" VOr'en looks directly at the Rodian. "Any info you want you won't get now,better to just get it over with." "If I live I will kill every mothers son of ya. But you I will save for last you die slow." There is nothing but rage on Vor'en face and venom in his words.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-13 17:46:56)

Deeluk: "Come now, this is nothing personal, just business. If you get the chance to kill me, I suggest you take it. Because I'm about to exploit you enough for the both of us. If you want to die, I can make that happen. But rest assured, more of your friends will suffer as this one did if you don't tell me what I want to know."
Deeluk paces around the room a bit before opening his mouth again.
Deeluk: "We don't have to make this any more unpleasant than it already is...just cooperate and you'll be safe, along with your friends."

### **ganthet** (2008-03-14 01:01:28)

"Oh trust me if I get the chance you will die." Vor'en looks at the floor stareing off into nothing. "You made this personal when you killed the boy. If you where as bussiness like as you say you wouldn't have had to done what you did." Vor'en slowly looks up at his captor. "If you had any back bone you would have come after us yourself instead of sending your friends."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-16 20:43:50)

Deeluk: "Well I guess I can't expect you to be happy about the situation, but you and your people have stepped on a lot of toes. Business must be handled regardless, I hope you'll understand."
Deeluk motions to the control console.
Deeluk: "I'm going to ask you some questions now, if you tell me the truth...no harm will come to you and you will be released. Answer all questions truthfully and we won't have any more problems...now doesn't that sound nice?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-16 20:49:33)

"No what sounds nice is to kill you and your friends." Vor'en says nothing but hate in his voice. "Why don't cut them loose and then you can have your fun with me." "They have nothing to do with this they where just following orders."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-16 21:11:46)

Deeluk has his green hands hover over a switch on the computer console.
Deeluk: "That brings me to my first question...who are you working with?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-16 21:16:28)

"Non of your bussines green skin." Vor'en says. "Go ahead and fry me, I won't tell you squat."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-16 21:34:20)

Electricity begins pulsing through Vor'en's body with vicious intensity. The pain is tremendous and the only thing he can think about is the pain stopping. He lets the discharge go for about seven seconds and releases. *Make an endurance check Vor.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-16 21:40:22)

Vor'en feels like his body will quickly give out if he endures this much longer, the surge of electricity definitely hurt him.
Deeluk took his hand away from the console.
Deeluk: "Ready to talk now? Who do your friends work for?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-16 21:47:39)

"Ha!" Vor'en laughs weakly. "They trained us for this stuff back in the 501st." " You don't go right for the kill, you got to work them over a bit frist." Vor'en fee,s every fiber of his being hurt. "They work for me Green Skin! Havn't figured that out yet."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-16 22:14:33)

Deeluk: "I don't think you get it, your friend is an example of what happens if you don't talk. I have many others that'll sit in that same chair after you, that's if you are too foolish to talk. Save yourself and your friends trouble, you have the chance to save everyone!"
Deeluk sends an electrical charge through Vor'en once again for about eight seconds. Vor'en cannot tolerate the pain it seems. *Endurance check.*

### **ganthet** (2008-03-16 22:25:53)

"I work for the Reminate." Vor'en says trying to talk throw the pain. "They are part of my cover, which you are blowing by the way." Vor'en looks around trying to regain any strenght he might get in between shocks. "My job is to find out what information I can about the New Republic and report it back to the higher ups."

Deeluk retorts.
Deeluk: "Oh yea that's believable, your identichip says you are in the New Republic. Why would you take a job from us and try to release slaves if you were in the Remnant?"

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 00:33:26)

"Think about it if I did some good deeds it would get me in." Vor'en says. "Then when I delivered the little ones to the Them they would open the door for me, and I'm in." "If you check my back ground you will see that I was going to be court marsheled and then shot." Vor'en loks up at the ceiling trying to steady if voice. "That was also part of my cover. Can't just walk up with a big sign that says "Imperial Spy" now can I?"

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 00:40:54)

"Of course, I had to have my in with them." Vor'en look stright at him. " Apparently that is all I needed. Then pass the back ground check and boom I am in." Vor'en looks around to see if he can see his equipment. "If you look on my datapad you will see they want me to be an officer for them." "Go on check not like I am going anywhere."

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-17 00:48:25)

Deeluk: "Why are you interfering with Hutt business? The Remnant made an agreement to stay out of Bordo's affairs, thought it would be mutually beneficial for both sides. I want to know where you took those slaves, they are worth a lot to us."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 00:53:07)

"I had a job to do." "They didn't care how I did it." Vor'en still looking him. "I took the frist thing that popped up and went with it." Vor'en looks at the floor trying to compose himself alittle more. "I was supposed get resalts not worry about who made deals with who." " You have to also realize that they don't tell all there opertives everything they can't aford to blow there covers now can they?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-17 00:56:24)

Deeluk: "Doesn't matter what happened, it's obvious trust has been broken between our parties. Now tell me where you took those slaves. Since you are an agent, you have no communication, your friends won't know any difference as to what happened to you."

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 00:58:58)

"Took them to the NR Embasy and turned them over to there grandmother there." VOr'en says still looking at him. "Like I said had to have away in."
"What better way could there have been?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-17 01:00:11)

Deeluk: "NR Embassy, what is that?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 01:02:07)

"The New Republic's headquarters here on planet." Vor'en kind of looks at him a little stunned. "Don't tell me you did know the NR was playing in your own backyard."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-17 01:04:34)

Deeluk looks shocked as he walks around to get a breath.
Deeluk: "No we didn't, but you just told us. Where is this embassy located?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 01:06:35)

"Maybe 8 to 9 minutes walk to the Northeast from where we were ambushed." Vor'en says as commly as possiable. "I am surprized you wheren't watching us given where the attacks happened."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-17 01:40:28)

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 01:49:11)

"The slaves maybe there don't know, like I said the grandma took them off some where. Didn't see where." Vor'en thinks for a second. "The building is big kind of spread out. Gaurds on the front door don't know how many more." "Speeders in the back I think." Vor'en trys to sound as convinceing as he can.

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 01:54:39)

"I had to have away in didn't I?" Vor'en puts alittle anger in his voice "They were going to let me return them now would they?"

### **ganthet** (2008-03-17 02:00:15)

"Take it to the Imperials when you get the chance. I don't know." Vor'en head drops down looking to the floor."They won't tell you anything about my operation because it is need to know and they don't need to know." "Listen I have 1500 Tuggets in my gear take those bill me for the rest ok."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-17 02:07:37)

"You would have to let me go so I can contact my boss he isn't going to meet with you." Vor'en stares at the rodain some more. "He isn't going to talk to me with anyone around. So your just going to have to trust me on this aren't you."

"Nope they are part of my cover. Can't just go around telling everybody now can I." Vor'en looks around trying to follow the Rodians movments. "my supiors are in the Remnate though. If you want your money I can arange that." "But you would still have to let me go."

"Depends on how long it takes him on his end." "I am undercover remeber."
Vor'en seems to think he is getting some where with this he hopes.

Deeluk: "You've got three friends, each day that passes, equals a dead friend. After they are gone, we come after you. We have your identichip, I'll give you a comlink and that's it."
Deeluk fires a stun bolt into Vor'en and he immediately goes unconscious.

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-17 17:21:14)

Vor'en awakes face down in the sand, with the taste of it in his tongue. He can feel the suns bearing down on his back. He looks up and he can see the western archway of Mos Esre about 150 meters away.

Vor'en rasies to his feet slowly, realizing he as nothing but the clothes on his back and a commlink he starts to move toward the settlement. "They could have at least dumped me in town." He says to himself.
As he moves toward the settlement he realizes he is going to have to contract his freinds and the NR if any atemped in rescuing Rith and Anwe is going to be made. Swithching to the NR command signal he comms Lt Felzor. "Felzor this is Vor'en I am outside the settlement heading in follow my signal and bring the others with you. Your not going to belive what happened to me."

"Can't tell you right now. You will just have to trust me on this." Vor'en looks around some more trying to see if there is anyone around. "Maybe after i get some credits i will buy you that drink we talked about." Vor'en turns off the commlink and keeps walking.

Frelzor signs off reluctantly. Vor'en looks at the area very carefully. He can see nothing but sand and the settlement, the suns seemed to be getting hotter every second. He didn't feel like anyone was around, no one that was looking for him anyway.

"Stupid fool." "You should have known that they would be listening in on the comm." Vor'en walks to the settlement. "I am going to kill me a Rodian wheni get back and use his inards for boot laces."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-19 21:32:25)

After the short eight minute walk, Vor'en begins to notice he is sweating quite a bit, even after the absence of his blast vest. He crosses under the ominous archway of the Mos Esre settlement, and he appears to be close to the cantina section/bazaar. The area seems heavily populated as usual. He can't seem to notice anyone watching him or anything.

"Funny you would think I guy wondering in from the desert would attract more attention then this." VOr'en looks around to see if he sees anyone he notices. "Well I suuppose I should figure out how to do this." He starts walking toward some place to find away to make it look like he is doing what he said he could.

The woman seems sympathetic towards Vor'en, she avoids a customer who is trying to buy fruits.
Woman: "Well, I suppose a little call wouldn't hurt, you seem in very bad shape."
She hands over the comlink to Vor'en.

"Thank you. when I get some money I will repay you for this kindness." Vor'rn keys in to the Commlink to Lt Felzor. "Lt Felzor, I need a place where we can meet. I am being followed paln acordinly." Vor'en waits for the responce.

"Negative on that sir. We got jumped before able to get there." Vor'en thinks of a few places that would be safe. "Meat me at the Race track Cantiana not far from you. Come in civilian clothes and I will be waiting outside." "Got to go meet me there." With that Vor'en turns of the comlink and gives it back and walks toward his meeting with Lt Felzor.

Lt. Frelzor: "Ok, well it shouldn't take me that long. I'll have one of my men take me out there on the speeder. See you then."
Vor'en realizes that the walk won't take long as he is already in the bazaar area. He walks about two minutes and treads into the familiar cantina. It was alive and jovial as usual. It made Vor'en wonder how people could be so entertained as if they had no care in the world when there had recently just been a blaster fight. The standard sabacc,pazaak, and dejarik games were happening. There was also bets being placed on a shockball tournament.

After about fifteen minutes, Lt. Frelzor strolls in with a normal desert tunic and cloak. He quickly notices Vor'en and approaches him.
Frelzor: "Shall we get a table?"

### **ganthet** (2008-03-23 02:02:30)

"Sure." Vor'en glad to see a friendly face. "I suppose you are wondering what happened." As they set down at the table VOr'en starts to tell him about what happened when they where on there way to see the Mayor about the job. He tells him about the Ambush and being questioned about the NR and other things. "They seemed more interrested in the kids we rescued and ther money then anything else. I lied about being a Remate agent, and that I had a contact that could get me the money they wanted." "They have Anwe and Rith, they have also killed Ben and have someone else that traveled with us for a bit." Vor'en looks to see if the Felzor is understanding any of what he is saying. "Also the reason that the mperials havn't attacked here is because the Hutts have some kingd of deal worked out with them to keep them out." "I need to make it look like that I am meeting my contact and that the money is on the way to buy more time for Anwe and the others. Can you help me on this?"
(OCC: Vor'en will tell Felzor everything that transpired and baseically come clean about what he siad to get out of there to help his friends.)

Lt. Frelzor: "Well the slaves are still in the city that I know of. We were arranging a transport for them but we aren't sure of the Star Destroyer's intentions. They've had short-range fighters patrolling the entire system. Do you think they may still be looking for their slaves? And yes, we could arrange a meeting in town as if you were meeting a contact. But do you really need the money or are we falsifying that?"
The officer makes himself comfortable in his chair, despite the ruffians in the bar making things crowded and loud.

"I would like to keep up the impreances that I was doing what I said I could, and that would included making it look like I got the money." Vor'en takes a breath. "I realize that this is making things way to complicated for you and I would try to repay you the best i can for any help you can give me on this." "I also want to take these guys out of the picture and save the members of my team that they have." Vor'en looks defeated like he is not used to having to ask or beg for help from anyone.

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-23 22:25:11)

Frelzor: "No don't worry about it. You are in the Republic, we are a big team. We also agreed to have the slaves delivered to us safely. We'll get a plan in motion quickly, and hopefully we can save your friends. So it's the Hutts that have been giving you trouble? This settlement is mostly influenced by Bordo's gang. We try to stay out of their affairs. You'll be acting independently from us. We can't have the Hutts thinking the Republic has a slave-freeing operation, I'm sad to admit."

### **ganthet** (2008-03-23 22:39:48)

"That is understandable sir. I have dealt with The Hutts on more then one ocation." Vor'en looks relived to hear that the New Republic is willing to help out in this. "I will still feel like I will own you something for the help. We got into this mess before some of us signed up.' "Again Thank You."

"I need to keep up the appearance that I am doing what I said i could to try to get them out. So ya, thats about the size of it." Vor'en starts to look alittle troubled. "Is there going to be a problem on this sir?"

"Being hooked high voltage power cables will do wonders for your appearance." Vor'en say jokingly. "They said I had aleast 2 days to come up with the money but I would rather do it sooner. The said they would start killing my friends if it took any longer."

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-24 21:42:14)

"Some place public." Vor'en looks around to see if he sees anyone looking at him. "That way if I am being followed they can see that I am doing what I said I could." "I might need a blaster in case thing go wrong."

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-24 22:40:54)

Frelzor: "Sure, I got this. Just let find a place and I'll send my guy out there in about thirty minutes. Who all got captured? Was it your friends that I met?"
The officer hands Vor'en a blaster pistol of medium type. *Knowledge tactics to identify.*

"They have Anwe, Rith they have already killed Ben and then there might be one other." Vor'en takes the blaster pistol. "As soon as you can get the money aranged, contact me on my comlink they will be listening in so use a comm that they won't recise."

For a place I would say the gate where I came in is not that far from here and it is plenty public." Vor'en looks aliitle relived that the NR is willing to help out. "Make sure your man knows who I am and knows that lives are at stake on this." "I still feel like I will O you for this. I always pay my deats."

"Well a fully armed strike team and the location of there hide out but I can't get that so I guess no." Vor'en gets up to move toward the door. "Ok I will be around the area of the gate and awaiting your man. Thank You Sir I will try to get them out alive." "Oh one more thing can I have your commlink for a while I'm is being monatered." After getting the answer about the commlink Vor'en leaves the cantiana.

### **ganthet** (2008-03-26 18:10:29)

Walking out of the cantiana and head for the gate Vor'en starts to woner if the rest of his team know about what has happened. Looking at the commlink the the Felzor gave him he thinks about calling them and letting them know what has happened. Trying to find a place where he won't be seen he dails in com number to Hardu's link." He kid hows it going? We ran into a few problems on the way to the Mayors place."

After a few seconds, Frelzor and Vor'en listen in on Hadru's transmission.
Hadru:'Vor'en! What? Where are you!? We are here rescuing you!'
The two people can hear slugthrowers being shot, even amongst the chattering cantina patrons.

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-29 13:00:36)

"What kid how did you find the location of there hide out so quickly?" Vor'en looks up at Felzor. "Is there anyway to track where they are?" "This whole serade might be for nothing if they sucessed."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-29 13:07:00)

Not waiting for a responce from either person Vor'en specks into his comlink. "Awne and Rith are still there. They are still capatured. I repeat Awne and Rith are still in danger." Vor'en starts to look really worried that his might all go south real quick.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-29 19:39:36)

Frelzor: "Yea, you can trace them easily."
He examines the comlink, and hooks it up into his datapad.
Frelzor: "Seems they are not that far, they are north by northeast. I wish I could help, but the Republic can't touch this. If you take an action, you do so on free will, not by the Republic. It sounds cold, but I'll explain it later."
Another transmission comes from the comlink.
Hadru: "Vor'en answer me, where are you?! Where are the others!"

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-03-31 13:57:06)

"Kid I have you north north west of where I am." Vor'en's mind races with what could be happening. "Stay there, keep fighting I will be there shortly."
Vor'en takes off running toward the sence of the battle. "I don't know where they are being held so you will have to search each building." He heads in the direction that the luietnate indecated. He hope's that he will get there in time to make a differance.

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-01 00:33:55)

As Vor'en is heading through the crowded section of the bazaar, he hears a transmission from his comlink.
Hadru: "Voren!...Answer me! Where are you?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-04-01 01:24:03)

"Kid, I am north northwest of your position heading your way. I am near the bazzar near the the Race Track cantina." Vor'en starts to wonder if his friends are in over there heads on this. "Hadru, I need you to find Rith and Anwe, they are there some where." Vor'en pushing his way through the crowd trying to get to them.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-02 03:00:26)

Vor'en works his way through the crowd quite easily, and he breaks out of the main area of the bazaar. He runs through an open area with not many buildings, to a patch of another set of buildings. It seemed he was in the big residential area, and the comlink beep begin to grow louder as he zeroed in on his friends.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **ganthet** (2008-04-02 13:01:57)

Vor'en listen to the beeping sound from the com link. Thinking to himself. *"I am almost there guys, hang on a bit longer."* He races in the direction that the sound is the loudest. Also listening for the sound of blaster fire to would acompany the sound of battle.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 ( Unknown location/Vor'en's thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-08 19:55:47)

As Vor'en continued to move down past speeders and people past the houses of Mos Esre, he could faintly hear blasterfire in the direction Frelzor had indicated. It seemed he was quickly closing on his target.
