# [Into the Storm] Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-16 19:55:00)

After a long and cramped 4 day trip, Kayli's E-Wing finally dropped out of the hyperspace wormhole. She instantly saw the large globe of Thule fill her cockpit viewport. The world had more cloud cover than most planets she had ever seen. It also seemed to have a olive green hue to it with large patches of blue ocean. The place had a very foreboding sensation to it in addition to it being fairly large. Kayli had a feeling that the clouds would blot out the sky while she was groundside.
She heard an incoming message.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Unidentified channel: "Greetings traveler. Welcome to the Thule system. This place is not for everyone and we'd advise you to be careful in your travels. This place is best suited for adventurers and those who seek a thrill. Weather is a constant problem as lighting storms bombard the land. At this time, the space lanes are being lightly traveled. If you have any requests, please connect to Thule Ground Control."

</details>

The message goes on in several different languages. This was a prerecorded message to warn anyone about any hazards and the channels necessary to find a dock.

Sev the droid wakes Kayli moments before the fighter drops out of hyperspace. She stretched out as well as best she could inside the cockpit. She listened to the automated message, until it repeated again in basic, then switched it off.
"Well then, seems pretty lax to me." She says more to herself then the droid who was her constant companion. She reduced her energy consumption to a minimum, to conserve fuel. At least that would be her official statement should she be questioned by ground control. If it made it harder for her to be spotted by ground based sensors then so be it.
"Alright Sev, We might as well start sweeping the system with Passive Sensors. And see exactly how "Light" the traffic really is." the veteran fighter pilot tells her companion.

The sensors began whirring and Kayli watched her display screen. There was a sparse amount of light civilian vehicles coming and going from orbit. Their travel patterns suggested they weren't doing anything out of the ordinary. Her sensors also locked onto a IPV-1 System Patrol Craft. Its transponder marked it as a friendly unit. So it came up as a green dot on her display. It's registry was marked as "Thule System Defense." This vessel seemed to be on a routine patrol of the planet. It was at medium distance from the E-wing and the shields were not active.

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-16 21:03:14)

Kayli noted the System patrol craft, and with the traffic showing nothing unusual. She altered course, and brought the ship onto an approach vector to the planet. She kept her sensors online and at maximum sensitivity. She didn't want any surprises when she reached Thule.
"Sev. Keep a list of all the traffic in the system. I want to know if anything sticks around longer then it should." She tells her droid.
(continue sensor sweep)

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-16 21:25:22)

Kayli angled out her E-wing as she heard her droid confirm her command. She noticed the ship was quickly in the heat of reentry. After this brief period, she saw the dark clouds approaching her vehicle. Once she was in the blackened clouds she had to rely on her sensors to guide her ship down at proper elevation. When she broke the cloud cover, she saw the brownish/dark green surface of Thule all around her viewport. She adjusted her descent and set the heading to the LZ coordinates downloaded into her ship's sensors. She was not really picking up anything out of the ordinary. There were lifeforms, but she'd guess that was wildlife as she couldn't see any settlements in this area.
Thule seemed to have much in the aspect of rolling hills and plains. But it was really tough to tell in the blackness of night. Visual scanning was difficult except when the occasional lightning blast would illuminate her vision. There didn't seem to be any ships in the area.

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-16 21:33:02)

The life signs didn't interest Kayli to much, and adjusted the display to filter them out almost automatically. What she really wanted to pin point were power sources, as well and structures and large quantities of minerals.
"Don't be afraid to speak up if you notice something I miss, Sev." She tells the droid. She then does a quick check of the chronometer, wondering how much time until the rest of Red Group arrives.
(Continue Sensor sweep)

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-16 21:49:24)

The sensors didn't reveal anything other than spanning hills and wildlife in this particular area. Then again, she was orbiting the area around the LZ coordinates. Perhaps if she traveled in other directions she would be able to pick up something. The LZ sector seemed clear of power sources, structures, or mineral deposits. Whatever was at the Falsoor target site, was placed in the middle of the wild.
The chrono reads that it is 32 hours and 12 minutes into the day. She had about 6 more hours until it was midnight. There was no way to tell how soon the others would be here.

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-16 21:53:35)

Kayli plots a course, that would allow her to cover the most territory in the next six hours. Flying a spiral pattern starting with the LZ in the center and moving outward. At an altitude that would give her optimum readings. She then had a sudden though.
"Sev, Cut the Transponder if you haven't already. If Falsoor is here and up to something, the last thing they want to see is a republic fighter doing a survey of the planet."

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-16 22:02:08)

*Are you going to scout through the target site coordinates? And if your not, how far are you going to stay away from it in estimate?*

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-16 22:16:27)

(( She'll do a fly over, but she'll climb to a higher altitude, and allow gaps in the spiral so she only flies over it once. Not allowing more then two klicks, for a gap though. ))

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-16 22:23:39)

*Ok, so you're flying over the target site once. What is the estimated elevation over the target site and are you going to go within two kilometers of it?*

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-16 22:31:52)

(( Whatever altitude that put me at extreme range of any ground based AA guns. ))

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-16 23:00:33)

Kayli took her E-wing in a wide patrolling arc and made sure to raise her elevation to just under the cloud layers. She took her ship on a skimming route under the dark clouds. The clouds were certainly depressing but the lightning bolts that were constantly jumping about the sky were quite breathtaking. The whole patch of clouds was bristling with purple bolts. Kayli took special care to watch her sensors as the black horizon was distracting and covered with the spectacle of dazzling lightning that lit up her cockpit from the dark.
She observed her sensors and noticed that they locked onto one colossal life form. It seemed to be flying in a direction away from the target site. She was unable to tell the type of creature it was but it was about 1.5 km up from sea level.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-17 00:04:35)

Kayli decided to ignore the creature for now, unless it proves to be hostile. Besides, pursuing and killing it would only waste resources she might need otherwise.
She continued her course, and after surveying a 1000 kilometers diameter around the LZ, she she made a break back though the atmosphere, to check out the system traffic once more.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-17 13:14:31)

The pilot circled 1000 km out and saw that the land broke into the seas of Thule. The whole portion of land she observed though seemed to be an isolated section with no settlements. It was possible there were nomadic locals around with limited technology but she would only be able to confirm that from groundside. There was definitely a lot of life forms spread out across the land mass, and the same was true for the seas. Once her radial reconnaissance was over she set a new heading to low orbit. The E-wing cut through the shadowy clouds and it was somewhat relieving to see the dark-blue night atmosphere over the cloud cover. She took careful notice to scan any vehicles and it seemed like the typical sparse traffic she had seen before.
The E-wing's sensors also locked onto the IPV again. It seemed to have a course locked in for a steady orbit of Thule. The ship was most likely just planetary defense. The system wasn't heavily defended, so the Thule inhabitants probably weren't used to much trouble.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-17 13:26:01)

((And what readings did I get for my fly over of the target? ))
Kayli nodded. Satisfied that there weren't any immediate danger awaiting for the Starshade. She settled the E-wing into a parking orbit around Thule. "Well Sev. Looks like its time for the hard part..."
She leans back in her command chair, and tried to make herself comfortable once again. "The wait."

---

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-17 13:29:48)

*Well the only thing you could read was miscellaneous life forms and the one colossal flying creature. There is very little of interest in or around the target site. Then again, you might not of gotten to best reading unless you were closer.*
R7 acknowledged her master's sentiment. He also gave a suggestion in binary to maybe listen to the local information channels.

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-17 13:36:47)

"Alright Sev. Patch me though." She replies, unsealing her helmet and taking a few unappetizing bites of emergency rations, just so her stomach wouldn't be growling at a bad time. But in the meantime she simply relaxed.

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-17 14:09:45)

The information station came in very clearly over Kayli's radio. A voice in basic was going on eloquently about the weather and where to go to arrange docking. It also spoke about cheap housing options and the various opportunities to plunder rich minerals here. The whole idea seemed to be targeted at adventure seekers and those ready to make a quick credit. It also gave wind of the primary culture of Thule, which seemed to be very rigid because of the fact that military life was the way of life here. Also, there were some commercials to join the Thule's different military branches. So Thule's way of life enjoyed order. However, it seemed there weren't that many established cities here.
The current events seemed to be peaceful and with little disturbances.
Then she caught a news flash:
Information Channel: "2 two days ago, there was an unpredicted assault on the planet Sernpidal of the Julevian System. The attack came from a new found species believed to be called the Yuuzhan Vong. The species unleashed an unbelievable attack which involved pulling the planet's moon, Dobido, into the surface. Casualties are unknown at this point. The motive of the Vong species is also not clarified. One of the victims killed in the tragic action was New Republic and Galactic Civil War legend, Chewbacca the Wookiee. The Republic has officially stated they are investigating the assault and the instigators behind this will be brought to justice. More information as the events unfold."

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Avarna** (2010-01-17 14:33:36)

"Well. That's certainly not good." Kayli says to herself. Recording the broadcast about this attack by the Yuuzan Vong to share with the others when they arrive. It was always discouraging to hear about the death of such a historical figure, but there was nothing she could do about it, Not to mention she had a mission to focus on.
"Falsoor might end up having to wait, depending on how series a threat this turns out to be Sev." She says to the droid.

After 3 days of hyperspace travel, the *Starshade* arrives in orbit of Thule. Vor'en and Lieutenant Kierlin notice the humongous globe of the dark green and blue sphere fill their viewport. The green and blue colors were obscured by the intensely thick cloud cover. The planet was quite large compared to most in the galaxy. It was quite a sight to see.
Both of you hear a message coming out of your radio that pierces the silence of the cockpit.

*Awne was able to reconstruct her lightsaber using Sarin's dish emitter and a new wiring job. Your cracked crystal is unstable, giving it +1 dice of damage on a crit and deactivation on a natural one. Remember your mismatched lightsaber provides +1 to hit.

Woro was with the rest of the team in the Starshade waiting for the mission to begin. He went through his supplies for the mission making sure everything was in place.
While he did so his thoughts went back to his meeting with Kaz. It was as he had suspected...Kaz's bond was stronger with Awne. He would observe Kaz on this mission, and when it was over, if he thought Kaz could maintain an appropriate relationship with her, he would recommend that Awne be made his Master. Such a powerful bond could make training much more effective in helping Kaz develop his power, the same way Woro and Lorhas had bonded. Of course, he wasn't sure if anyone had actually made a recommendation like that tho the higher up Jedi before. "That might make for an interesting meeting," he thought as he collected his supplies and made for the door to meet up with the rest of his team.

"Yep, I did a fairly extensive sensor sweep, Covering a 1000 klicks diameter around the LZ, and even did a fly over of the Target." Kayli continued, double checking that the channel they were talking on was encrypted.
"The only local forces of note is the IPV system patrol boat. I did detect a large number of life signs, along with some very large creatures. But I didn't pick up any power sources or metal deposits."

AYMARIC AND KAZ'JEE'S ROOM
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

After leaving Meeks in the briefing room, Aymaric heads back to his own room, the one he was sharing with Kaz'jee. It would take awhile for Meeks to verify Aymaric's medical training, so he took this time to nap.

</details>

AYMARIC AND KAZ'JEE'S ROOM (1614)
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Being woken up by a kick to your foot from an uptight military officer is not a great way to start a mission, but Aymaric didn't expect any less from Meeks. Swinging his legs off his bed, the slightly drowsy former republic Soldier watches as the IM-6 droid and a Republic Soldier follow Meeks in with the gear he had requested. "Umm. You could've called first." He offers Meeks a smile, one he hopes the ass will interpret as a sign that he didn't care about Meeks or his attitude. Nodding towards the Soldier who just dropped his load of the gear on the floor. "So Commander, this Soldier here to guard you or me?" Meeks and the Soldier give the awol Falsoor employee no response to his comment or any indication that they will indulge any further conversations. "Alright then, let me verify you brought all I have asked for." Quietly going through the gear and making sure the money was transfered to his account, he stands up and hands Meeks the signed data agreement.
As Meeks and his Soldier quietly leave, Aymaric gets up to close and lock his door, but before his door is completely closed, Meeks turns around and says with a big self-satisfying smile. "You have less than ten minutes to make it to the Starshade before they take off. If you are not on that ship when they leave the hangar, you will be spending the rest of their mission in the brig. Got it Merc?" A sour look, Aymaric certainly didn't want Meeks to see, jumps on the newly ordained Mercenaries face. "Ass."

</details>

AYMARIC AND KAZ'JEE'S ROOM (1620)
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Leaving the door to do what it wants, Aymaric rushes around the room picking up his equipment. "You, droid, get that equipmet you brought in and take it to the Starshade now!" Grabbing up the remainder of the equipment he uses his free hand to comm Vor'en. "Sergeant, I mean..crap...Vor'en! Vor'en come in, I need you to hold that ship!" No response. No signal, they must have unsynched his comm mic. "Asses!"

</details>

DARK STALLION HANGAR(1623)
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The ramp to the Starshade hadn't closed yet, but the engines were on and warmed up. The droid, IM-6 had just hovered onto the ramp as Aymaric came through the hanar door. His face beet red with exertion and soaking wet with sweat. Closing on the ramp and hoping he doesn't get left here while the ship takes off, he catches out of the corner of his eye a tall figure in an officer's uniform. MEEKS! Aymaric had enough time to look and see the man with that same self-satisfyed grin on his face.Inventorying possible rude gestures in his mind, he is interupted by a warning alarm screaming it's message of emminent hangar door opening. He gives up his attempt at one last insult and boards the ship, heading towards the med bay to unload and strap in.

</details>

STARSHADE MED BAY PRIOR TO LANDING ON THULE
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hearing what must be the voice of the person now in charge, Aymaric finishes donning his armor. He learned a valuable lesson on Vijun, never go into the unknown withoutyour armor and weapons. His weapons had been hastly pt in a medicine closet and would remain there until he could grab them. Now though, he buckled in and waited for the landing.

Lt. Kierlin sets in his new heading and angles the freighter out toward the atmosphere of Thule. Within moments, they've cleared reentry and they are descending into the dark clouds of the planet. Vor'en and Kierlin observe the lighting tearing through the shadowy clouds as they keep their focus on heading to the LZ. The Lieutenant elects to keep his lights out as he did not wish to be spotted miles away.
The freighter ahd the starfighter curve out their flight route to skim over the spanning plains and hilltops of Thule. There didn't seem to be much vegetation that they could see. Corporal Vor'en kept feeding navigation data to the Lt and informed him that wildlife was abundant amongst the rocky terrain.
Once their within the proximity of the LZ, they went ahead and landed their vehicles with respective distance to one another. Vor'en and Lt. Kierlin exchanged glances as the vehicle powered down. They heard the winds of Thule nipping at the cockpit framework once silence took over. Beyond the cockpit, they couldn't see much except some shrubs being swayed by the wind on the ground. It was night time and difficult to see from inside the illuminated interior.
The chrono meter on the flight panel indicated it was roughly 4 hours from midnight.

"IM-6...no, I am going to designate you as Mix, M-I-X. Do you understand?"
"Yes sir I do. My new designation is Mix, M-I-X."
"Good, now Mix, I need you to go to the cargo bays on this ship and do an inventory of the medical supplies stored there. When you are done send me a comm message that you have completed the inventory and leave a data record of the inventory in that drawer. Got it?"
"Understood Sir. What should I do when I am done with the current tasks you have given me?"
"Stay in the med bay and power down until I need you. Can you fly this ship?"
"If the need occurs Sir, I can fly any ship, implementing basic maneuvers."
"Alright then, that's all I need to know. Get to the inventories." Without another sound, literally, the droid moves off down the hallway to the cargo holds. "Damn I'm glad that thing left. Was probably a mistake to bring it along. Piece of junk's probably a spy for that uptight Jerba, Commander Meeks!" Putting down the piece of mesh tape he had just torn from the roll, Aymaric pulls a small vial from his utility belt and inserts it in a med dispenser. Placing the device up to his armpit, he hits the dispensing button and waits to feel the warmth of the liquid move through his veins.
Relaxed and a little less focused, he finishes writting the large D with a smaller A inside it, on the piece of tape. Satisfied that the job was adequete he replicates the design on another piece of tape. Done with his art project, he sticks both pieces on the armor to cover the republic emblems still stenciled there. "Much better."
Walking through the hallways, Aymaric does a mental check of all his equipment. MedKit, Utility belt, Subrepeating blaster, Deathhammer, holdout blaster, Snare rifle with grenade launcher and of course his new armor. Everything he needs to render medical aid to the members of Red Team.
Walking through the doorway of the passenger section of the ship, Aymaric announces, "Hey everybody! It's Doctor Me! Who's ready to save the galaxy!"
TAG: Anyone within earshot of Aymaric.

He doesn't have his helmet on yet, so he will be recognozed by anyone who knows him. He is wearing GTU AV-1s Scout Armor from the S&V CG. There is no picture, but it is medium armor so it will be a little bit bulky compared to the light armors we were wearing. It is OD green with squares of mesh tape on the left breast and right shoulder. His med kit is a little odd looking because he had to adjust it so it would fit over the repulsorlift system on the armor. He has a Sub-repeating blaster pistol attached to his right thigh, a Merr-Sonn "DeathHammer" strapped under his left arm, a holdout blaster strapped to the left side of his stomach and a snare gun w/grenade launcher on a sling over his shoulder.

Taking the encouraging gesture from the Wookie, Aymaric gives Woro his own thumbs up, using only one hand though, he still had his helmet in his hand. "Hiya Woro! How have you been? I haven't seen much of anyone while I was on the Sallion." Stopping short of any additional social niceties, Aymaric remembered he had an issue to deal with. "Hey, I need to get my comms synched with the team again. Seems when they confiscated my old gear, they cleared out any coding I had on my mic."

"Hey big guy," Woro says, remembering that the human couldn't understand him. He clapped Aymaric on the shoulder in a friendly gesture, welcoming him back to the group. The medic had been in the medical area pretty much non-stop since the team boarded.
He tossed his own com to Aymaric to see if he could extrapolate the team's signals from Woro's currently functioning com.

Taking the offered pat on the shoulder and the comm mic, Aymaric looks at the friendly Wookie quizzically. "I have about three of these Woro. I...oh, I get it. Okay this shouldn't take but a second." The realization of what Woro was attempting to do took a moment to sink in, but it did. Pulling out his datapad and attaching the two earpieces to it, he begins to work on getting his own comm synched. "Hopefully they didn't change the frequencies or the access codes."
As he is attempting to load the data, Awne and Kaz'jee walk in. The pair seemed to be closer together than when he had last seen them. Using is one free hand he waves back to the pair and produces a bright smile. "Hello you two. I'm glad to be working with you again. Hopefully this will be just a gathering mission and not like Vijun. Either way I'm..."
Then the Lieutenant walks in. A proper military officer, he was direct and to the point, no fluff. "I was a little delayed but I managed. I wouldn't want to miss an outing with Red Team would I?" Looking down at the datapad and a little shocked to see it was going slowly, he looks back up at Lieutenant Natirash. "I'm certain I'm squared away with my gear. I have my droid doing an inventory of the ships medical equipment and as you can see, I have almost everything anyone might need."
He takes another look down at his datapad and notices an error. "Actually LT. Do you have the codes to synch my comm. Mine seems to have been wiped when the Stallion's crew took my gear."

Looking down again at his datapad, Aymaric realized that the error wasn't coming from the program being used to synch the encrypted comms. It was coming from a game he had forgotten to close out before starting the transfer. "HA! Found the problem. I should be good to go Lieutenant. Seems they didn't change anything from the last mission, so it looks like my comm is synching itself like it should. Thanks though."

Lance Starfell hits a button to lower the ramp control. Red Team waited in a line to disperse from the ship when the ramp hissed to the ground. Corporal Vor'en took the initiative by taking his fire team out first.
Private Lance and Jocen went in separate directions in a smooth motion. Vor'en followed up by walking straight away from the freighter. He immediately noticed it was quite dark and he was kicking through many dry ankle-high bushes. The environment was annoyingly windy and it reminded Vor'en quickly about how life in the field was. The veteran took a knee and scanned the horizon with his electrobinoculars.
There was a multitude of hills spread out across the plains. Vast amounts of dried out shrubs dotted the surface all around. A single plateau resided in the east which seemed to have nothing out of the ordinary about it. The skies were black/dark blue and lightning continued to illuminate the area off-and-on, albeit briefly. The ground was sandy and would be rough on the ankles/shins once they started moving.
Vor'en's detailed surveillance revealed womp-rat sized creatures at the base of the plateau about 75 meters away. However, there was nothing else that would be of interest.
The rest of the group walked from the illumination of the *Starshade* into the windy darkness of Thule. They set up a perimeter around their ships and waited for the next set of orders.

As Awne steps from the illumination of the ship her ears lower slightly near on immediate from the winds, they would slowly rise as she got use to the forecefull winds but for now it was a necessary instinct to protect her ears.
Blue eyes narrow against the wind, taking a moment in standing to let them adjust to the dark and to the winds before moving out. She knew the Ewok to be at her side and she took great care in ensuring to take the brunt of the wind to keep him from having to fight too much to stay upright.
As the Wookiee comes to them she nods her head "Agrreed." she calls, turning her back to the wind and pulling the wookiee closer with one hand and the Ewok into their semi circle with the other, Shielding the littlest fuzzy and allowing them to have an easier time talking.
"Kaz you arre Knight Thrree forr this mission you will answerr to it when addrressed by the otherrs in the parrty though Worro and I will most likely continue to call you by name." She looks to the wookiee "He doesn't have a com, if someone calls forr him on it we need to make surre to hand it to him to talk and rretrreave it afterr."
She looks back to the Ewok "Stay close to us, if you find you arre having trrouble with the winds eitherr tug on one of us orr hold onto a hand orr leg, we'll underrstand and help you as best we can."
She nods her head though there was one more "We arre the only Jedi on this mission, forr the sake of this we must act as Lorrhas, Feldon, and Lues and be confident and do what is in the best interrest of the otherrs, ourrselves, and the forrce. Use yourr senses to the best of yourr ability, we thrree have morre capabilities in this condition then the otherrs, use everrything to ensurre all safety and completion of the mission."
She looks between the two, she had said what she needed to and it was true, they were the only Jedi, and their masters were not here for guidance, this would be a test for both of them as well as a test to see if Kaz could even handle the responsibility a Jedi carries.
Taking this time now Awne surveys the area with her sight suited for low-light and stretches through the force to help her determine and hostiles or perhaps what way is best to begin their search.

Kayli walks over to her E-wing and ascends upward into the cockpit. She powered up the fighter and departed the landing zone toward orbit of Thule. The red lights of the fighter's undercarriage illuminated Red Team which was forming into a ranger file. While they were forming up, the Jedi didn't really seem to used to the tactical formation. They haphazardly found a place to walk in the group. Corporal Vor'en designated his fire team to stay with the *Starshade.* After a moment of organization, the group began moving toward the southeast. Lieutenant Kierlin had map in hand guiding the patrol toward the target destination.
The members were actively scanning the plains and hilltops of the spacious terrain. There didn't really to seem anything of note as they walked through the vast open land. Awne senses felt much more keen than they did on Vjun. She could feel the life of Thule radiating brilliantly. However, the wildlife did seem quite out of balance. Something was disturbing them, but she wasn't sure what. There was a great disturbance in the Force as well... what did it all mean?
Nevertheless, the patrol kept walking toward their destination to the southeast. After about 32 minutes of marching something peculiar happened. A distant roar could be heard bursting out of the rushing wind in your ears. It seemed to be coming from the west.

There was no way to tell what was behind any of the hills either. The brief illumination periods did not bring any help as well. Whatever was out there, it was a good distance away.

The Lieutenant and Warrant officer coordinated their search by talking through their comms. Kayli then brought her E-wing down to conduct reconnaissance of the *Starshade* and the friendly patrol route. She brought the ship under the cloud cover and flew a considerable distance above land to avoid any detection. Her sensors picked up the usual wildlife surrounding the freighter and the troops on the ground.
However, she was able to lock onto another gigantic energy spike. The lightning was causing her scopes to have some interference so she couldn't get a 100 percent clear reading. It seemed that the colossal life form(s) were 550-600 meters to the west of the ground patrol. The airborne radar blips seemed to be heading northeast, the opposite direction of the patrol route.
Back on the ground site, Lt. Kierlin climbed up the hill next to Sgt. Detonite's team who was prone and quiet. They looked up to the Lieutenant with curiosity in their eyes. The lieutenant kneeled as he felt a gust of wind blast his face. He began scanning all around to see anything. The binoculars produced a clear image for him to see. Unfortunately, there was nothing around for him to take notice of.
Near the middle of the patrol, Woroken stretched out his feelings to detect what was out there. He was able to feel a tip in the balance of the Force. It was a Force sensitive group of creatures that were airborne. It was indeed coming from the west but not approaching the group. Suddenly, he felt the Force creatures alerted by his use of the Force. It seemed they were attracted to those strong in the Force for some reason. As if to answer Woroken's Force beckoning, a roar could be heard once again in the west.
That's when Woroken suddenly remembered a lesson in the Force. When you use it to find others, it becomes easy for others strong in the Force to find you. Master Lorhas had reminded him of the dangers a few times. Hopefully whatever was out there wasn't hostile.

Lieutenant Kierlin organized his squad to orient to the west. They spread out in a tight line across the top of the hill and somewhat on the side. Natirash laid prone next to Detonite and Vor'en so he could pass orders out to his men. Detonite had his men laying down to the right of him, eagerly anticipating an ambush. Everyone was well-informed to wait for the command before opening fire. Aymaric and his speeder bike resided at the bottom of the hill, having complete cover from the kill zone.
However; Awne, Woroken, and Kaz were all laying in the "beating" zone waiting for the creature to show up. They were out in the open area surrounded by shrubs and being pushed by the violent wind as they awaited some sign of the creatures.
Once the formation was set and everyone was ready...a few moments passed with anxiousness. Every person felt the wind pushing into their ear as they tried to listen to a command or movement. Each person reached out with their hearing for something to comfort their mind of the anticipated action.
That's when it happened. Woroken looked up to see a gigantic winged creature diving straight down at him. The wookiee's Force senses warned him as the huge monstrosity crashed into the ground awkwardly. The apprentice was able to use the Force to leap from harm but was possibly appalled at what happened next.
The huge beast clambered up in a menacing pose. It's body mass was the size of *Starshade* and its limbs were 6 meters long. The creature possessed an even longer neck. It resembled a scaled, bird-like being. The head was rounded and it had a curving, tough beak with orange eyes. They seemed to gleam in the darkness with a hunger for blood.
It had 2 arms and two legs with 3 claws. His chest and body was covered in scales that looked as thick as any armor. He also boasted enormous wings that could get him anywhere in a hurry.
The neck stretched out and let out a ferocious roar that shook the ground. He was heading straight for Woroken and it didn't seem he was stopping.
*Ambush is coordinated due to Lt. Kierlin. Every military member receives +2 init. Detonite and Vor'en receive an extra standard action. Everyone also has +2 to attack. This lasts only for one round and the LT gives up his turn.*

The squad on top of the hill saw that the large creature was going straight for Woroken with what seemed to be hostile intent. Lieutenant Kierlin ordered his men to open fire at the animal. Staff Sergeant Eriks was the first to pull the trigger and discharged a burst at his target (two standards for ambush). The blaster bolts struck the beast in its front arm, effectively initiating the ambush on the charging threat.
*It is now Awne's turn.*

Awne frowns as she turns to the hilltop, why was it always shoot first before one knew what was truly going on?
The farghul turns back to the beast, it was attracted to the force so maybe it preceded them as a threat as they preceded it to be. She couldn't let it go after Woro though and she couldn't let it go after those on the hill...one thing to do she supposed.
Stepping forward she takes her saber in hand in preparation but feels out through the force in an effort to establish calm "Worro tell them to stop firring." she yells over to him though she tried to remain calm and tranquil. Better it thought her the threat then the others.

Woro pulled his saber, but did not ignite it, and held up his empty hand in a "stop" gesture, although he doubted the beast would recognize it. He tried to reach out with the Force (telepathy) and request the creature 'stop' as well. "Stop," he emoted to the animal, shifting his weight to a more defensive posture in case the atempt to parlay was ignored.

As the winged-beast closed with the Jedi, they were attempting to persuade the creature with the Force. However, both of their efforts were fruitless. The animal didn't seem intelligent enough to understand the notions of the Jedi. Woroken saw the creature's long neck rearing back for a strike at the wookiee.

The line of Republic troopers had concentrated fire against the creature in a well-organized attack. Blaster shots zipped off the hill and into the mass of the wild animal. Vor'en's rounds were especially accurate as they hit were he was aiming. The bolts seemed to be hitting his breast, which appeared to be chipping off his scales. The gigantic beast seemed to be absorbing a lot of hits thanks to its galvanized hide.

From above, Kayli notices an increased energy emission from the patrol's coordinates on her scope. A colossal life form was apparently right on top of them. She looked out the viewport and could see nothing. As she was around 12 kilometers above them looking down into the darkness.

Shortly after the teams blasters start barking at the creature attacking the Jedi, Aymaric hears the frustrated words of (place holder).
"Red Wing, this is Red Bacta. The team has engaged a creature of some size. Requesting assistance. Suggest a north or south approach and watch the comm transponders. Two Jedi danger close."
Satisfied he has done the best he could for the current situation, the merc turns his attention to the west. An easy ambush for the team could become a deadly battle if something came at them from behind.

Aymaric's transmission flooded out of Kayli's subspace radio. R7 whirred in response to the danger of their comrades, urging Kayli to assist immediately. She was now hovering somewhere below cloud cover easily within range of the ground patrol.

The ambush line kept up a steady stream of blaster fire at the charging creature. Staff Sergeant Eriks kept his sights trained on the beast as he repeatedly squeezed his trigger of his light repeater. He observed that his rounds on target were being absorbed by the monster's tough scales.
*Kayli you can act now; otherwise, it is Awne's turn.*

Kayli curses in fluent huttese into the com system, as she turns the Fighter. She dropped the altitude, taking the E-wing as close to the canopy. She didn't dare open fire until she got better targeting data. Hopefully for now, just the sound of her ion engines would drive away the creatures.
"Red One, Please tell my you grabbed those targeting lasers like I told you too." Kayli called out over the com.

Awne extends her hand and reaches out with the Force. She focuses the energy around the creatures neck and aims to have the the Force restrict that specific area. The long necked beast let out a muffled out growl as it ignored the attack by the farghul. He shook his head at the attempted Force grip but kept moving toward the wookiee.

He too ignites his saber, hoping seeing the energy blade up close might be enough to convince the creature to back off. Knowing this was unlikely, though, the wookiee realizes that if teh creature hits him, it was going to hurt. A lot. He mustered all his energies to focus on attempting to minimize the creatures attack as much as possible.

Blaster weapons didnt seem to faze the creature, Natirash figures he'll try something else, pulling out a thermal detonator he sets the time for six seconds, if anything the blast would disorient the creature, Taking a knee he throws the thermal detonator towards the rear of the creature, hopfully the creature itself would shield the jedi from the blast "FRAG OUT!!!"

While the ambushed continued, the Lieutenant observed his men firing and instantly thought of his next move. He pulled a thermal detonator out of his utility pouch and sat up on his knees. The soldier released the grenade at the tail of animal while falling back prone.
After a few seconds passed, a tremendous heated explosion nipped at the beast's tail. A thermal blast illuminated the darkness around the beast which projected a shadow at the Jedi. The monster yelped and pulled its tail away. Unfortunately, it seemed to have scales to protect its body there too.
Immediately following this attack, the long-necked creature turned his head to the Jedi and began hacking in its throat. It seemed to be regurgitating something. In just a few moments, the beast had launched a projectile similar to a flaming hairball coming from its beak. The fiery ball landed at Woroken's feet with an explosive impact, engulfing Awne and Woroken in the blast.

Kaz'jee watched as his friends tried to cmbat this huge beast and all the while this was going on he suddenly has an idea. Instead of trying to fight it and make it more angry...maybe the answer was to try and calm it. He fires one shot from his blaster towards its head to draw its attention, then starts to sing and belt out his voice. It wasnt necassarily any particular song...just a soft but beautiful melody designed solely to try and soothe this savage beast.

The ewok had his SSK blaster pistol and fired in the direction of the creature. The bolt sizzled past its neck without even phasing it. Once this happened, the furry one walked back a few steps and began singing. While this was occurring, the battlefield dynamics had certainly changed. Their was an ewok singing during an ambush, attempting to charm it. Nevertheless, the animal still had its orange eyes set on Woroken and Awne.

"Red Wing, Red Bacta." Aymaric had moved from the bottom of the hill to the top so he could give better direction to the pilot above. He now looked down at the computer screen on his speeder as he talked. Using it to coordinate a pinpoint strike on the fire breathing beast. "Our target is standing between two fireballs!" Using the speeders computer he sends the exact coordinates to Red Wing and readies himself to fire on the creature if the pilot doesn't finish the job.

## Re: Chapter 2 (Thule)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-24 22:25:42)

Aymaric inched his Aratech Speeder ahead and moves the short distance up to the firing line. The men were oblivious to his presence as they were in the heat of battle. The medic then looked in the direction of the huge winged beast and he observed the monster was chasing Woroken down. He then gave a quick glance to his map and then to the dragon. With the wind in his face, he plotted the coordinates and screamed into his headset the location of the beast.
Kayli heard the desperate transmission of coordinates over blaster fire and she typed into her forward display. Two beeps emanated from her targeting computer which signaled to her the target was locked in. She pushed a button and the targeting computer unfolded in front of her head, resting neatly in front her eyes.
That's when she saw the welcoming view of the electronic crosshairs in the computer's screen. They were waiting for the ship to be in range of the colossal radar blip before giving her the sweet sound of a weapons lock. That meant anything in front of her gun turrets would be a smoking crater.

Vor'en sees that his weapon was not doing a lot of damage to the creature. Then he hears that the Chief was about to cook this bird but good. Switching to his comm link his old habit being leader kicks in. "Knights! Disengage from target you have incoming! Awne get them out of there!" he raises his weapon and fires off another burst at the creature.

Vor'en kept his weapon on automatic while transmitting a message by the comlink. He tapped the trigger to get a good quick-controlled burst. The trio of blaster bolts connected with the beast's scales.
The whole ambush line seemed to be slowly chipping away at the creature's armor with each shot. But it was still going strong. It appeared to have a lot of fight left in it.

Eriks looked at his two men and nodded "Alright boys time to show them our stuff. Brace before opening up your cans of whoop ass. Do this with only two clips and one round of drinks is on me!" he said as he took aim on the beast, bracing himself before opening fire. As the bolts starting flying from his light repeater he tensed up his body enough to control the burst to a smaller target area. Soon his own blaster fire was joined by the sound of two more blasters going full auto.

Awne watches as the red bolts streamed onto the winged creature. It kept stomping to Woroken regardless. The farghul ran forward a bit and grabbed the ewok by the hand, cutting his singing off. She ran with Kaz 'Jee by pulling him along. They were moving away from the loud shots and roaring monster. As they moved, she spotted a low rock in some shrubs to their right that could serve as cover from attacks.

Woroken sees the monstrosity squaring off with him and darts to the left. The beaked animal jerks its head quizzically and roars in response. Its large legs made quaking footfalls with each step.

Aymaric sits atop his speeder watching the winged creature chasing Woro. He contemplates using the speeder to help Woro escape, but Red Wing's eminent attack keeps him from rushing to the Wookie's rescue. His only option, besides sitting here doing nothing, is to try and remember what this creature is and where a weak point might be located.
Short seconds later, the medically trained merc comes out of his contemplative state with an answer he hopes can help. He twists the throttle of the speeder and moves towards Woro and the creature, attempting to keep his distance until Red Wing's airstrike comes.

Aymaric sat upon his speeder as it was hovering on the hilltop. He scanned the creature carefully. It had the features of a giant bird, but with arms and legs. It had a curved beak and armored scales. The wings on its back were gigantic. Truly unlike anything he had ever seen or ever heard of in the known galaxy.
Nevertheless, he pushed the throttle down on his speeder and heard the accelerator kick in with a pop-hiss. The repulsorlift propelled the small craft at a moderate speed toward the creature. Aymaric angled his bike to the left a bit just to target the tail side of the beast. He let out a well-aimed shot at its back and saw a yellow bolt strike it in the back.
The medic then straightened out his vehicle in the direction of Woroken, though he was hard to see in the dark.

Corporal Vor'en relays the message to the fellow Jedi as he lays in the prone. Once he does this, he leans up and fires a burst at the monster. He had fired so many rounds by now, and so had the ambush team. It was a continuous stream of blaster fire that was deafening to the ears. The display of red bolts was like a fireworks display over Coruscant. The creature seemed to be wearing out by attrition, but still going strong enough to be a great threat.

As the group continued the battle, they saw Kayli's E-wing approaching from the northwest. They couldn't hear anything but it was rapidly approaching. A few seconds after the starfighter was spotted, a tremendous explosion engulfed the winged animal. The beast was knocked over completely in the blast and it blinded everyone for just a moment. The explosion was particularly close to Aymaric and his speeder who was driving by. You then hear the E-wing boom overhead as she passed the ground patrol's position.
Once the dust had settled from the attack, you noticed the beast was laying motionless. Kayli's E-wing also had passed the position and was out of sight.

Awne takes refuge with the Ewok behind cover, pushing him down and moving over to cover him from whatever was coming.
And then it flew over and lit up the beast, blinding her for a moment; closing her eyes she waits for the boom to leave before looking up.
Unmoving was the beast.
Standing slowly she moves closer not only to ensure that indeed it was not going to hurt them but also in the hopes it still might be living, a wasteful death for a creature they knew nothing about...though...she hoped it hadn't hurt the wookiee.

Woroken heard the loud sound of the fighter's weapons going off, saw the huge dust cloud blown up from the impact, and kept moving away from the scene. That creature was so durable, he doubted that even a direct fighter blast could have dented it. However, the sound quickly died down, and he turned seeing the huge creature was motionless.
After catching his breath for a moment, he walked back in the direction of the monster. He was not about to attempt to use the Force again, he had to make sure the threat was gone through his own senses. He saw Awne standing glumly near it--she wasn't any more happy than Woro was that it had to be killed.
"Thanks everyone," the wookiee growled over the comm. "That was my fault, Awne, it locked onto my Force signal, I guess, and there was no shaking it." He looked for the ewok to ensure he was okay as well, before continuing. "We have to be really careful using the Force here, I got sloppy and almost got all of us killed," he said.

Kayli dialed down her thrusters and brought up her repulsor lifts to hover over the ground, she kept the nose of the fighter pointed towards the beast, as she prepared for another attack run upon it.
"Red Wing, to Red Bacta. Please confirm the Target is Neutralized." She spoke into her comlink, even as she glanced at the life sensors to try and see if that would tell her what she needed to know. Kayli was a soldier, and threats had to be neutralized, thats just how it was.

Awne looks up to the wookiee and shakes her head, it wasn't his fault, they had no way of knowing how it would react so it was no ones fault..they learned, and they were alive.
She moves closer, her saber still at the ready as she keeps watch, looking for signs of breath, listening for a heartbeat , she wished she could use her sense in the force to tell if it had moved to the stream but no...for now they would have to be blind to that.

Awne approaches the large creature who was laying on its side. She walked past the scorched earth and smoke, trying to see the beast. Once the smoke cleared the farghul noticed one thing...
The creature's chest was rising and falling, indicating it was still breathing. She also noticed the bird like animal was much bigger than her. It was alive and unconscious. The creature also had torpedo shrapnel embedded in its three-toed leg. A large gaping red wound was present to the apprentice. It was likely causing the creature great pain.

The creature was still alive, which didn't please Aymaric at all. What really got him a little angry was how everyone was standing around the thing, looking at it like it was a dying relative! "KILL THE DAMN THING!" He was yelling into his mic. Emotions making him forget his comms would activate when he talked.
Bringing his speeder to a halt about 15 meters back, the merc hops off and hollers some more useful advice, not so loud this time. "It's dangerous and could easily kill all of you! Did any of you think about the fact that it might have friends who could show up and not be too happy you slapped their friend with a proton back hand?" Sheesh! Jedi and their mushy hearts!

She looks to those moving around "Be carreful though it is unconcious, pain and a beast do not mix well if it believes itself to be in dangerr orr corrnerred."
She growls again at the medic "it does not need to die. It was not at fault forr attacking, we werre." she motions to herself and the wookiee "it rresponded, and did not like the use of forrce."

"DAMNIT Aymaric, That doesn't tell me a damn thing!" Kayli screams into the comlink. She didn't ask if it was still alive, She asked if it was neutralized. That meant was the thing still a threat!
"YES or No, Red Bacta, Is that creature still a threat?" The fighter pilot clearly wasn't impressed. She dint' know who was running this commando team, but there was a serious lack of communication going on.
She didn't even wait for a reply as she, brings the E-wing fighter down for a landing, in the clearing with the rest of the commando team. From there she opened the cockpit and threw her helmet into the seat, and climbed down the latter. She ignored Aymaric on his speeder bike and walked directly to Natirash. Where she promptly decked the lieutenant. "Just what sort of Joke of a commando team are you running here?!"

Awne turns her head slowly to the male that had so little care for another life as to simply kill it while it was down. She growls darkly advancing on him slowly, her saber was still in her hand but had yet to be activated...till now. It angered her, deeply upset her that someone could so blatantly try to kill a beast they had no knowledge about and when it was done, attempt to and it's life.
She was upset, angry, pissed off even that he could do that, how could he! it was a life! it was hurt!
She could feel her temper raising, could see red...
How dare he turn that against a helpless beast...
How would he like it if he was hurt and it was turned on him...
He shouldn't be allowed to use it..
she could feel something build and lash out even as she continued to advance.

The farghul and E-wing pilot both close distance on the Lieutenant. Kayli seemed to be moving a bit quicker.
*Surprise round on Natirash. Kayli acts first followed by Awne.*
The pilot walked straight up to Natirash who was standing there over the defeated beast. He had his carbine in hand and aiming at the creature. Kayli delivered a sound punch to the jaw and Natirash felt the impact keenly on his face.
While this was happening, Awne was concentrating through the power of the Force. She felt an exhilarating burst of energy flow through her mind. It seemed Thule seemed to be speaking to her at this moment. And the aura of the whole world seemed to have an incredibly receptive feeling for her.

"I don't know what sort of CRAP your trying to pull Natirash, But I'm here to supply you with some God Damn Air support. I'm also YOUR Exec on this mission if you forgot. So why is it when the SHIT hit the fan, the only one to reply was the Medic, who couldn't give me a proper Sitrep?" When he turned his weapon around, she drew her fire knife, The weapon energized the second it was removed from the sheath, glowing faintly like a lightsaber.

At the side of the hulking creature's head, the Lieutenant lunges forward with his butt stock. He grazed the Warrant Officer's shoulder and she responded with a knife slash. The weapon grazed the Lt's flight suit and he felt the wind from the attack. He then dropped his carbine down and then stepped back from the knife-wielder. Kayli went to slash at him again but his swift back step avoided the slice.

"This creature needs our help, and I am going to try to help it, if possible. That might have been why it reacted so poorly. Awne and Kaz, please tell the group that I am going to try and heal it a bit. I'm not as good as Feldon, so I can't heal it much.

Seconds after his laughing fit, Aymaric is now sitting up. He has his arms resting across his knees and his chin resting on his arms, a big grin of delight sitting under his nose. This was the most entertaining thing the merc had seen in months. "A live show! A comedy at that! And free even!" HIs comments were said mostly in a whisper. His comm had been turned off as well, he didn't want to be rude during the performance.
His head snaps up and to the left as the underbrush comes alive. His heart begins to race at this new unknown, he almost gets up from his sitting position, but then he notices the small fuzzy form and rounded ears of Kaz. Aymaric raises his hand in the air and pumps it in a silent cheer for the heroic Ewok as he fights his way through Thule's shrubbery to come to the aid of his companions. Aymaric thought that adding a little white chubba, as a steed, to the scene would have been better though.
Woro's growls broke through Aymaric's...thoughts. The urgent tones in the Wookie's voice brought the man back to the seriousness of the situation. Aymaric had great respect for the Wookie. He was the only Jedi that lived up to Aymaric's idea of what a Jedi should be. Woro was already working on the animal when Aymaric puled up next to him on his speeder. It was obvious to the trained medic what the Wookie Jedi was attempting. So he hops off his speeder and stands next to Woro. "Here, let me help. At least this time if the thing wakes up we can use the speeder to get away."

Kayli didn't press forward while he was down. She was going to have to have words with the mercenary that thought this was so terribly funny, but now wasn't the time for it.
"Lieutenant Natirath, Its my conclusion that you are unfit for command. Please give up and don't make this any worse for yourself." Kayli held her fireknife ready yet. She didn't want bloodshed, It was just clear that this man was negligent in his duty and needed to be removed.

Woro held up one long paw toward the medic, hoping he would wait before helping with the creature. "Last chance, everyone, if you want to get back and take cover, go ahead and do so, because he and I are going to help it,' he says, pointing to Aymaric. "Who knows, we might even make a new ally." He didn't say the rest of his thought, that they might have to try and down the creature for a second time. That wouldn't win him friends with the military, but from his observations of the last couple weeks, that might not be a bad thing.

Kayli and Natirash continued to square off in fighting stances in front of the downed creature. The lieutenant was in more of a defensive stance while Kayli was attempting to talk him down. The situation for Red Team had certainly become more volatile. As this was occurring, Corporal Vor'en was trying to bring order into the ranks.
Aymaric had also assembled next to the animal to get some sort of analysis done. Unfortunately, it was a rare creature if he had ever seen one. He did not know what to make of it. It had scales where there should be feathers, and a durasteel like beak. Almost like it was the perfect predator. It was likely king of the food chain around here.
While all this was going on, the remaining troops who had just finished up the ambush began setting up a 360 degree perimeter around the animal, seemingly in accordance to Vor'en.

Kayli then turns and approaches Vor'en. "Sergent, Its clear To me that LT Natirash Is unfit for command. However, He seems to resist those charges as forcefully as I make them.

Climbing the boarding ramp, Kayli flopped into the cockpit and sealed her helmet. She then closed the cockpit, shutting herself off from the rest of the party. The fighter pilot then activated the repulsors and the E-wing rose up into the air.

Oh well he'd have to figure it out later making his way over to Vor'en " Corporal Vor'en, get the men together this has been a colossal waste of time and resources, we're moving out in 10 minutes. "

" with that the LT begins laughing, this situation was so stupid it was hilarious, if the mission kept going at this rate he would have to abort.

Aymaric continues to assist Woroken, perplexed a little by the creatures ultra unique physique. The creature was totally unknown to the man and that thought disturbed him. "What could this thing be?"
He follows Woro's line of examination and notices the shrapnel was pretty minor and should be an easy fix. Patting the wookie on the back. "let me get my kit." As he pulls his hand away from the furry mamal, he notices moisture on his hand and a distinct smell of blood. "Woro! Your bleeding! why didn't you say anything?" Grabbing his gear he preps for a minor procedure. "Hold still."
"Hmm, that's unfortunate." Closing up his kit, Aymaric reaches over to Woro's own med kit and pulls out a med pac. "I seemed to have forgotten to restock. Guess with all the distractions on the Stallion I didn't get the chance to restock like I wanted to." Healing the Wookie, the merc looks at the LT as he sits down next to him. <em>&quot;Hows it going Aymaric, you mind patchin me up a little bit, good thing we got all those extra medpacs huh ?&quot; </em> Reaching in his med bag the medic pulls out a bottle, filled with a thick, dark brown liquid. He uncorks the bottle and hands it to Natarish."Here, this should help. It won't fix that bruise on your face, but it will fix your bruised pride. Don't drink it all though, I only have a few of those." As the bottle is handed off, Aymaric offers the LT the same chuckle he gave Aymaric a few moments ago.

Woro immediately feels better after the medic's treatment. Aymaric was very good at what he did. A little eccentric, but very ghood.
"Awne, could you let everyone know what we are planning to do? I am hoping that leg injury is what made the beast so aggressive. If Aymaric can get the shrapnel out, maybe the beast's whole persona will change. Everyone should get back to safety, in case I am making a mistake. If so, I can distract it while Aymaric gets out of the way. I think it likes me," he grins, not wanting to think about what will happen if the plan fails.

Thsi only caused confusion and slight anger within the Ewok but he shrugs it off before going over to Awne and Woro, nuzzling against both before tugging on the wookie. "Woro guna be safe...okay...?

Red Team seemed to be reorganizing after their apparent chaotic moment. Vor'en had remembered his training well, and while not coming to an ultimate solution, he at least secured the perimeter so decisions could be made. The wind was still prevalent as ever, and was quite annoying. Inside the defensive perimeter, Aymaric had laid down his pack and was beginning to administer medical treatment. He searched around in his gear but he couldn't seem to find his first aid packs. This could be troublesome. It could delay the patrol's movement. Nothing seemed to be working very well.
The creature was still laying unconscious. It had not been touched yet. Some of the team members were contemplating treating it as well.
But ultimately, the group's cohesion had been brought down out in the flat and windy plains of Thule.

After standing about for roughly ten minutes, the ground patrol reorganizes and begins walking toward their target. Lt. Natirash pulls out his datapad and checks his map. They had about an hour and a half walk but they were still on the right heading. Corporal Vor'en's team took point of the formation while Staff Sergeant Eriks brought up tail end charlie.
Kayli watched from her E-Wing as the team began moving. She gave Sev the order to fire up the converters and she did a short pre-flight check. The starfighter then began hovering and took off to give the unit air cover. Once she was in the air, she locked in the ship to provide a one kilometer orbit around the patrol. She made sure to stay 11 kilometers overhead though.
The pilot was left with no other orders so she did a circular recon for the moment.

The remainder of the ground team stood around the fallen beast. Aymaric began pulling equipment out of his surgery kit and hastily set to work. He injected some soothing agents into the trauma site and began slowly loosening the piece of torpedo. While he was doing this, Woroken was concentrating through the Force to help the wounded. The Force flowed through him and the beast like river, stimulating his body cells to rapidly regenerate. Woroken could feel its life essence rapidly growing.
After about roughly eleven minutes, Aymaric had completely removed the shrapnel. He had noticed the wound was cauterized and applied 3 layers of synthflesh, effectively depleting it. Aymaric turned to look at his gear when something happened.
The creature lets out a low growl...
Almost immediately the long neck of the creature snapped forward with a fierce predator's precision. The enormous beak swallowed Woroken whole as the beast laid on its side. The group turned in horror as the Wookiee was gone in the blink of an eye. The creature had been startled awake and had snapped at their friend.
*The beast received a surprise round as everyone was within the creature's threatened range. It basically got the group on you because everyone had let their guard down, so I'll rule you were all unaware of your opponent. Due to its immense size, their wasn't an effective way you could restrain it. You are all adjacent to the beast at the moment. Initiative Order: Awne 42, Kaz 36, Woroken 31, Aymaric 17, Winged Beast 14. Woroken had recovered 24 HP and Natirash 23 HP for the TI. The ground patrol is roughly 1 kilometer away from the Jedi, as Natirash ordered the movement ahead. Woroken suffers 58 damage from the bite and moves -1 on the condition track. Woroken also had taken 18 damage from the Vital Transfer earlier. This puts Woroken at 39 HP.*

While staying above the range of Anti-aircraft fire was the first instinct of any combat pilot. This time around Kayli did the opposite extreme flying just above the tree tops, to be better positioned to react to trouble on the ground.
When it was clear that the Knights were splitting off from the soldiers, Her responsibility to provide air support became more difficult.

She couldn't feel any of the beast's thoughts except primal hostility. It seemed it was hungry. The situation had swiftly gone wrong, and Woroken was in the creature's mouth.

Woroken lay on top of the creature's huge tongue, fading in and out of consciousness. Everything was fading fast, and he couldn't see anything or feel his body. The wookiee was shifted around on the tongue and then severed at the torso by the beak's grinding. The last thing he saw was the edge of the beak coming for his head. Then everything was black. Woroken let out a muffled growl out of the beak and you all hear a gruesome snap, silencing the apprentice for good. His bones and flesh were being chewed like he was nothing, but you all knew he wasn't nothing... your friend was mere food for someone to digest.

Thoughts of retreat never enterd the mind of the merc. His frind had just been grabbed, crushed and swallowed by the very beast the Wookie had been trying to help! The veil of surrealness came across his eyes again. He felt like he was sitting in a theatre, watching a distant and distorted screen. None of his actions were his own. He watched his body pull his newist blaster and place it directly against the creatures bandaged wound. The synflesh not setting so soon would offer little resistance
The light from the repeating blaster was beautiful as it's bolts danced on the creatures unhealed leg. A soft hum, familiar only to those present on Vijun when the Jedi Master Lorhas failed, can be heard over the encrypted comm channel. "Hum, Hum, Hummm, Hum, Hum Hummm, Hum, Hum, Hummm."

Aymaric took his automatic blaster pistol and shot from his hip. He felt the weapon vibrate viciously in his hand as a stream of red impacted around the injury site. The creature winced briefly in pain as the bolts hit the exposed skin. The long neck of the animal snapped to the side as he was continuing to chew. The 30 foot tall creature appeared so hungry it didn't care about pain. Or it could just simply tolerate a lot of hurt.
Woroken lay sliced in multiple pieces inside the mouth of the monstrosity. His life force was fading fast but it at least it was painless. The wookiee had no opportunity to even reflect on his life as the beak came down again, crushing his entire body...killing him instantly. The bones and organs were crushed with a squishy-snap. It was no way for a sentient being to die. But, it is the nature of the food chain. The group was experiencing this reality first hand in all its visceral imagery. Once he was completely chewed, he was promptly swallowed.
To their horror, the rest of the group noticed that the bird like animal had stopped chewing.

His thoughts becoming clearer, the merc quickly moves to the head and fires his sub-repeating blaster pistol at the the eye of the beast.

Aymaric scoots over to the creature's head, as he does this, the beaked head quickly locks onto the medic. It's massive cranium turned toward him and lunged forward. The human watched in horrific slow motion as themassive open beak swallowed him completely. He saw darkness, saliva, and blood as he went straight into its mouth. The hard yellow shell slammed down on Aymaric and he felt his whole right side ripped clean off with one bite. He was shifted across the tongue as his legs were being grinded off from the mouth. The remnants of Aymaric were being shifted around like a doll, ripe for the plucking.

This wasn't working, she wasn't doing any damage to it and it was still eating them! She couldn't let it happen anymore, she didn't want to be eaten or worse have the Ewok be eaten next.
it's one of those moments, those moments where you're screwed. Stepping back she grabs the Ewok and makes a run for it, the speeder wasn't that far off if they could get to it they could make a run for it.
The farghul pushes the Ewok in front of her, running behind so at least if one of them were to be grabbed she'd be first, and she'd go down taking it with her; after all, her saber was still ignited.

Awne runs ahead and shoves the ewok to get him moving. The monstrous creature notices the activity and swings his back side around to attack. It's long and huge tail came crashing down on top of Kaz 'Jee, pinning him to the ground with a stomp. Awne was running so fast to the speeder and once she arrived she turned to see the weight of the tail on top of the Ewok. It's weight prevented Kaz from moving.
As this unfolded, Awne heard Aymaric let out a final yelp of agony. She saw his upper body clumsily spill out of the beasts mouth. His body was a red strewn of organs, flesh, and bone.
*Ok, Awne pushed the ewok forward which provoked an AoO from the bird. This was a new round so he gets one only for this go. He grappled/pinned the ewok with his AoO. Kaz cannot take any actions while pinned. Then, it was Aymaric's turn who took 43 devour damage….killing him. I went ahead and spent a force point…bringing him to unconscious status.

Awne shuts her eyes, reaching out for the power of the Force. She delved into the creature's mind and sensed that it was no ordinary being. It had a pack mentality that she could tell, and it was territorial. The farghul reached toward its stomach and signaled for it to forget its hunger. The mystical energy quickly permeated its brain. The beast twisted its head at the farghul.
The tail came off of the ewok, allowing him to take a big gasp of air. The monstrosity rose to its feet and shuffled about. He reared his neck back and then forward, producing a high-pitched roar that was deafening.
Then, the unthinkable happened...two more of the same creatures had flown to their very location and landed next to it. They all walked up towards Awne, shaking the ground with each step. The creatures then lay on their stomach, while Kaz and Awne spotted something peculiar. The creature on the right had a large saddle on top of its back. But not only was it a saddle, it was luxurious with a boxed seat to prevent you from falling off. Apparently, it was used for a mount. . . this was certainly an odd discovery. Why weren't the other creatures attacking?

Corporal Vor'en had found a pile of glowing rocks. They were flashing a bioluminescent blue as they leaned up against the side of the steep earth. They were something of interest and worth checking out possibly. The veteran was not sure what it was though. He alerted the team of his find.

Even as the beast roared she was reeling, she could make people..things...anything, forget. it wasn't until she felt the ground shaking that she looked up to find three of the giant monsters in front of them. Her muscles tense, ready to run to the Ewok and stand in front of him but...
were they bowing? was that bowing or was that...submitting?
She blinks slowly and look to the Ewok then back again, a seat on one takes her attention, so then...these beasts could be used for mounts? but by who..
She gulps faintly and looks between them all, she didn't forget even with shock that one had killed their friends and she shifts her arm to point at it, "You..y..ou arren't forrgiven, you ate ourr frriends." She looks at the other two "neitherr of you arre to eat anymorre of those that look like us, any that walk on two." she points to her legs to indicate.

Growling to the beasts he spoke "No ride...Get out...Took brother...took friend...Get away from place...Took one of Kaz'jee's masters..." He stood up and looked up to Awne "Awne and Kaz'jee leave now...yes...?"

As Awne and Kaz talked, the three calm creatures did not move. Their size was overwhelming yet they were completely still. They did not even acknowledge Awne's speech. Three large heads with yellow eyes just watched them closely and intently. The cool wind didn't even seem to affect them.

Natirash looks at the rocks but wasn't for sure what they were. He had no idea what caused them to glow like that. It was just something about Thule's ecology. Another one of Thule's wonders they had encountered most likely. However, it could be of some interest to Republic's world surveying efforts.
Meanwhile, Awne and Kaz boarded the speeder bike. It was still powered on by their recently deceased friend. While they were sitting on it, the three large animals began howling in a sad tone. It was almost strangely melodic in nature.

There seemed to be rich minerals packed underneath the rocks though he couldn't tell what they were. The sensor beeped with life as he continued his scan, waving it over the glowing rocks.

Awne closed her eyes, why were they sad..
One of them had a nice dinner of their friends but they were crying? why?
The Ewok's words made sense, she knew but she cleared her mind, thought back, it was a wild animal, even wounded ones would lash out on those helping them; that sparked a memory of home...she missed home..
She remembered though...training with her father in the forests, stopping when her keen ears picked up the sounds of struggle, she never thought it odd that he seemed to know the things she heard before she said a word, it was just father being...well father.
The two had moved after the noise, he letting the cub track it and hone a few skills but at the sight of a small wild thing..funny how species escapes us..but it was injured, bleeding everywhere and though her father tended to it, it kept biting, snapping at her when she would get to close and clawing and biting at him until he was finished...then it just ran off.
*"Animals can't tell us thank you, and even though they know they're being helped, it's in their nature to attack what's helping. Even then, it doesn't mean it personally, it's just afraid."*
Opening her eyes to the terrain and the sad singing beasts, the farghul sighs, tail flicking. "It's nothing against us...it was hungrry..and we...werre lowerr on the food chain." She mumbles faintly.
Sighing again, she gets off the speeder and motions to the Ewok. "Come on...they'll be fasterr." everything needed to eat...those that at meat never thought that they were eating someones friend or loved one, why would it differ here.
The law of nature..."Forrgive...and underrstand the balance. If anything, Worro would have rratherr died helping someone than forr nothing, and Aymaric died trrying to save a frriend." She says calmly to the Ewok "Jedi forrgive, to hold angerr and hate is to the darrkside, and if I am yourr masterr now, I had best begin teaching you."
She looks to the beasts "Firrst lesson...learrn to forrgive.."

Kaz'jee have bad feeling about this..but master says...forgive...so Kaz'jee try." He walks with her and holds out his hand, though at a somewhat safe distance to where he could pull it back if they were still hostile. In his mind he knew now that Woro would have forgiven them and takes a brave step closer now. "Kaz'jee...forgive you..."

Awne crawled into the boxed saddle and reached for the reigns. Kaz followed behind her. The beast stood up and noticed she was high above the ground. It let out a roar and it spread out its wings The other two mimicked the creature's actions as well. In just a few seconds, she felt the creature lift off and the riders felt weightless with the animal.
They were rising into the dark sky, going through the winds of Thule with grace and power of 3 colossal winged beasts. They were flying in a line formation and they noticed the two others were flanking the center creature. They seemed to be communicating with a sort of howling and squawking. Strangely, they were heading in the same direction as the patrol was.
As they flew, Awne saw an inscription carved into the tough seat. It was a language she didn't understand.
Back in Kayli's E-wing, her reconnaissance picked up 3 more large energy signatures emanating from the area they received contact. They were flying toward the target coordinates.

He saw what was left of Aymaric. It was the right side of his chest and it was chewed up. His face was mangled and the flesh had peeled back from the skull.

As Natirash returned, Kayli had no problems picking up the speeder bike, on her sensors. She amused herself by targeting the vehicle with her weapon systems, but didn't pull the trigger. Didn't even fantasize about pulling it. No if she had to finally kill this man for the sake of the mission, it would be face to face.

Getting off the speeder bike Natirash calls everyone in " Alright people lets pack it up, we're moving in 5, Vor'en hurry up and grab a sample of that mineral, We've still got alot of distance till we get to the target area. " Natirash hops back on the speeder and waits for red team to get in formation so they could move out.

Awne sees that the winged animals depart the perimeter. Once this is done, everyone finishes up their business and the group arranges in a straight line. They had a 5 meter spread, with Vor'en on point of the formation. He had neglected to pick up the minerals underneath the glowing rocks. The corporal did grab a mossy rock however. Once the group had closed in the formation, they started their walk toward the southeast.
It was an uneventful hour and 18 minute walk. Natirash had guided the team via his map on the speeder bike. He had annoyingly braked and accelerated for almost the whole walk. Luckily, no one caught wind of the party. The winged creatures seemed to be out of sight as well. As the terrain rose up slightly, Vor'en called a halt. He had spotted something in the direction of their target about 500 meters.

As the formation grinds to a halt, Natirash dismounts the speederbike and rubs his legs, the jerky stop and go journey had been tough on his legs and backside making his way forward to the point elements position he pulls out his electrobinoculars and peeks over the ridgeline.

Looking up to Awne to see her expression during the hike he asks "Awne...Awne Kaz'jee's master now...yes?"

Lt. Natirash looked through his electrobinoculars and saw a grim site. It was the target coordinates about 500 meters away. There was a foreboding black structure surrounded by a circular canyon. It sat atop a summit while being enclosed by the canyon. The canyon drop off was deep and made it appear that the building was not meant to be reached. There were multiple steel beams which seemed to be set up to harness lightning for a peculiar reason.
What Natirash saw through his binoculars was definitely the target site. There didn't seem to be any personnel. It was dark, foreboding, and devoid of life around it.
Kaz 'Jee walked over the small hill and also saw the same thing. He couldn't see anything else of interest besides the structure.

The farghul advanced toward Natirash, Kaz, and Vor'en. They were all spread out along the small incline, staring at the ominous structure. Awne was able to get a clear look of the building but could see no life around it. The canyon would make it a difficult process to get to the structure, if they were going to investigate it. This was definitely the target site from the coordinates downloaded on Vjun. There was no sign of Falsoor equipment however, and no way to tell if the facility did belong to Falsoor.

Natirash observed the pyramid shaped structure, trying to figure out the best method of entry. More than likely, they would have to descend into the canyon and then climb a top the tall cliff summit. It would not be an easy approach. If there was any opposition, they would be disadvantaged climbing up toward the building. It would be a great place for an opposing force to ambush.

While Awne is looking about, something peculiar catches her eye. Someone seemed to be beckoning her near the canyon's edge. She walked over to investigate and saw someone very familiar...
It was Mur Eva. She was dressed in her Jedi robes and was standing with her arms open wide. She then took her hood down to reveal her face. The left side appeared to be rotting off and both her eyes were red with yellow trim. The woman spoke in a jovial tune to Awne.

Everyone hears a loud blast next to them and you all see a brilliant blue flash that nearly blinds you. Awne stood in a smoking crater with something odd floating next to her. It was a large pyramid shaped crystal. The crystal had an odd shaped "organ" in its center. It was pulsating and hovering over Awne as if it were alive. The item was silvery and translucent with a glowing white light. She had been gone for 30 minutes and then had warped in front of the group.
The farghul had a whole new aura about her. Something incredibly strange was happening.

Vor'en looks at the structure try to figure out the best course of action to get near it. There could be traps or defences ofany kind around it or none at all. Climbing was the most obvious way to in but that may not be the best way. The Lt. wanted something from the him. "Well we scout it out and see if maybe there was away in there. I mean there would almost have to be something, bridge, trail something." Vor'en looks around at it some more. " I could take Awne and the fuzz ball and check it out before we commit to trying to get in. The chief could give us an eye in the sky and tell us if there is anything happening in there."
He didn't like the look of the place and it didn't look like something that Falsoor would use but there could be anything in there. Pirates, Smugglers you name it.

Vo'ren observed the pyramid structure closely but could see no easy way in. There wasn't even enough room for Kayli to land her E-wing over there. The only possible way to the building was to traverse through the canyon, and that meant difficult climbing.
Back in the sky, Kayli was encountering a difficult problem. Her navigation systems seemed to be shorting out from the energy surge. It was almost like an emp blast and Sev warned that they needed to land. So the pilot kept her descent steady as she was gradually losing power. She brought the ship down fairly hard with her nose down. The E-wing shook violently as she was unable to get her landing gear completely down. The vessel skidded through the dry land and shrubs as she came to a sliding halt. Kayli didn't have a scratch, neither did Sev. However, she couldn't say the same for the ship.
The whole ground patrol had watch her crash land. She was roughly 520 meters from your position.

"You want to explain what happened darlin' I mean if this is a new force power thing, it might come in handy, I hope it is not going to cause a problem. Had enuf of those so far."

Kayli cursed loudly during the entire forced landing. Without power she was trapped in the cockpit until the other came and to free her. But the pilot did her best to maintain military discipline throughout.
She had to dig little to get open the storage compartment to pull out her blaster rifle. She then worked to free her Droid Sev. "Come one Sev, Speak to me. I need you to fix the ship while we finish the mission."

The farghul walked toward him and they both noticed that the living crystal had reacted adversely. It began pulsing black very rapidly.
The pulsating black light quickly gained the attention of everyone. Suddenly, a black wave of energy formed around the group in an expanding sphere. The black sphere imploded and the entire Red Team vanished.
