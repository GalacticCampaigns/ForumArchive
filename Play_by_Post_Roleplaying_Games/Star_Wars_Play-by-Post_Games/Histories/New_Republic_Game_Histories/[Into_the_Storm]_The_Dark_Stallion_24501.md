Walking down the ramp, with little Ewok escort in tow, was a breathe of fresh air. Finally they were off the starshade and back onto the main ship and more over...
Awne looks down to her right arm, rolling the shoulder, lifting the arm, bending, flexing the fingers, she was in complete awe that her body could give her a new arm in just a matter of hours, or..days as it were.
She was thrilled, honestly thrilled, the conversation with the doctor was in the back of her mind as she was all but playing with her new arm in glee.
Even with the arrival of the others humans and the Sarge giving the news she was blissfully putting it all aside to play with the arm.

**Hangar Bay 7**
The Republic platoon sergeant snapped his fingers at some nearby medical technicians. The men then promptly went up via the docking ramp into the freighter. They were pushing around repulsorlift stretchers. The younger Republic soldier looked around with nervousness.
Private Jaxin: "Hey Starfell! Where's Theos at?"
Lance stepped away from the group and shook his head solemnly.
Private Jaxin: "Dammit!!! What the hell...it was just recon!"
The soldier then stormed off out of the group's sight. Vor'en knew he was probably on his way to the cantina.
After a few moments, the technicians came back down pushing the remains of the dead. An impenetrable air of uneasiness could be felt at the sight. After Vor'en viewed this, he stepped forward to head back to his quarters. The platoon sergeant stopped Vor'en by holding his chest.
Sergeant Seres: "Stand fast! I didn't say you were dismissed."

Not really bothered about what this officer wanted right now, Gor felt he had more pressing matters to attend to. First things first, he needed to get the information assembled during the mission to the people who required it...and he guessed this guy wasn´the one he should be talking to. And also, he still had that vision - or whatever it had been - lingering in his head. Had it just been a bad dream, triggered by all the things that had passed before? Or had it been something else? Had Mur Eva really survived?
He held that as unlikely, but still...*he* had gotten out, and his odds hadn´t exactly been great. But still, he would take care of the most urgent matters first, and he would make sure that the others were able to properly debrief before he told them of this. Well, maybe he would talk to Feldon...he trusted that the Jedi might be able to keep his cool at hearing the news.
"Excuse me sergeant, does that mean that those of us not actually commisioned in the army, and thus not under your command can leave? Because I have some errands to take care of, some of which I´m sure your superiors will be interested in"

Vor'en turns and spins in place, gaze fixed on the man. "Look! We have been trough five different kinds of Hell on your little recon mission. My squad is beaten and tried. They need to be checked out at the med bay and they need to rest. If you are going to stop me from seeing to my squad then I think you need to find some help fast! Other wise stand down and get out of my way." Vor'en was serious if the man did not get out of his way he was going to be picking himself up off the deck soon.

The ewok was laughing happily for many reasons. The first was his friend's new arm that had regrown, the second was that he was actually jumping up and trying to swat playfully at it. Lastly was finally being out in the fresh air. It felt so wonderful to him and he looks around for a minute before tugging on Awne's tail. "What we do now?"

The platoon sergeant looks over to the bothan.
Sergeant Seres: "If you want to have your contract picked up ever again then I'd advise you to follow orders, just like everybody else. The only difference between you and enlisted men is that you can quit in between missions."
The man turns his head to Vor'en, who he was still holding in place with his hand.
Sergeant Seres: "As for you....you know better. Don't let your discipline fail because you are tired. You will snap to and square your ass away. You still have work to do...is that understood? Now, what I need from you is that you tell me what the hell you're going to do with all these people you picked up."

Vor'en clams himself a little. "I thought that that you could assist them for helping us out while me where on planet. They worked for Falsoor who has abandoned them back there." He trys to clam himself further. "They need transport off that world and to somewhere else." Looking at his squad. "Red team, stand to and answer any questions these gentlemen have." Turn to the Sargent. "Sir, we need to contact the med bay, we have dead on the ship that need to be dealt with. Sir" Vor'en stands at rest waiting for orders.

Sergeant Seres: "As you can see the docs just carried your casualties away. We'll organize for a memorial when possible. Furthermore, I'll send it up the chain about securing a transport for those Vjun locals. Meanwhile, you need to delegate down to your men to fill out a report about all the locals you have gathered. What they were doing...what you want to do with them now...etc. However, you need to report in to Major Kiernan now for a debriefing. The rest of these people are free to bunk up with your men. None of the Vjun locals are free to roam the ship until the reports are turned in and cleared. They are restricted to their quarters pending the locals report. But your troops and the Jedi are off-duty. "
Feldon steps forward and addresses the Sergeant.
Feldon: "If you don't mind, I'd like to take this man here and take him in for questioning. He attacked us and I'd advise we take him to a holding cell to accommodate Force-users."
The Jedi Knight gestures towards Sarin. Lues Van promptly disarms him and is escorted away by the Jedi. Feldon remains in place and further reports to the Sergeant.
Feldon Azrik: "I'm now the representative for the Jedi. Anything you need from us please speak to me first. If there's nothing else, I must report to the Praxeum. May the Force be with you."
Feldon bows and courteously leaves the group. He gives a reminder to Aymaric about Awne's psyche report before he leaves.
*Here are the places you can visit on the ship. You've all been given personal quarters which fit two people very comfortably. The ship is 300 meters long and spans multiple floors accessible by turbolifts. It is such a large vessel that you need a map to get around. The visitable areas are:
**(Forward Section)**
Airlocks (likely to not be used).
Barracks
The Drifter (Popular Cantina).
Command Bridge (Admiral Elin Ordani)
Corridors (Turbolifts)
Gunnery Towers (accessible special corridor lifts, tbese are accessible through external hull areas. For example, the bottom of the aft section leads to the forward turbolaser control.)
Hangar Bay 7
Laboratories (Numerous, converted to use for reconnaissance purposes.)
Medical Bays (quite a few medical bays throughout).
Personal Quarters (Equipment lockers and two comfortable beds).
Surgery Suite
Administration Offices (Major Kiernan’s office)
Storage Rooms
Supply Rooms
Reactor Core
Training Rooms (Use these to gain experience…Republic Enlistees and Jedi only).
Security Control Rooms
**(Aft Section)**
Airlocks
The Rusty Frigate (Engineer’s/technician’s cantina…not a hospitable place for grunts).
Shield Generator (Restricted)
Engineer’s quarters (Tight living space)
Main Reactor

Now that they were free to move about she moves to speak with her master, showing off her arm but finds him already moving away. A sigh escapes her, she looks down to the Ewok playing with her tail and chuckles "Come on Kaz, I'll buy you a drrink."
She moves off in the direction of the cantina, intent to get a drink and some good food into both their systems. She knew the doctor or her master would track her down eventually to make her go to the med bay, but for now she was free.

Woro was mentally and physically exhausted. So much had happened in such as short period of time. He decided the first thing he would do was to stow his pack and supplies in his personal quarters. He had carried all these things with him for so long.
He quickly headed in the direction of of personal area. Upon reaching that particular wing of the ship, he grabbed the closest room to him and threw his things onto one of the beds, not bothering to stow anything.. He kept his lightsaber and grabbed Awne's broken one and decided to head out to the cantina where Kaz and Awne were headed. He hadn't had much of a chance to talk to her during the trip. He had asked Feldon about her whereabouts, but Feldon had mentioned something about she and Aymaric doing some research. "On her arm," the wookiee supposed.
He exited the personal area and headed toward the cantina.

"Sir. Do I have time to clean before reporting to Major Kiernan for debriefing? " Vor'en puts on his best subordinate routine. Most nerf herders like these two like to make sure you knew your place. He could not stand command staff that just wanted the people under them to fall in line cause they where a head of them. Could be why he shot that officer back in his youth. "Sir my team will give you its full cooperation, and file there reports to your satisfaction. Red Team knows there jobs sir." He keeps doing the professional soldier routine until they leave or dismiss him and his team.

**Hangar Bay 7**
Sergeant Seres: "You've got ten minutes to report to him. Use that time however you please."
The veteran sergeant quickly made his way to his personal quarters after a short turbolift ride. Inside his quarters, he laid out his service whites and made sure his uniform looked correct. His boots were polished and his rank insignia was measured correctly on his chest. He threw his old red/brown pattern camo in a storage bin and darted into the back of the quarters. He looked in the mirror of his refresher and noticed he had a gruff face but had no time to shave. After he got dressed and showered he moved quickly to the CO's office leaving his personal quarters in quite a mess.
**The Drifter**
Awne and Kaz had traveled the length of the ship's corridors to arrive at this cantina. This bar was full of Republic personnel in their service whites and various colored cover-all's. The illumination was fairly bright for a cantina and that was typical for a service man area. The large beverage dispenser was in the center of the room and it was surrounded by the circular bar table. There were booths lined up against the wall which essentially resided around the bar. At the end of the cantina was a stage for live performers, which was empty at the moment. There was a holovid presentation of Shockball going on however.
A small crowd was forming around the bar. This led Awne to believe that most people were just now getting off their shifts. The crowd was of various species which was a testament to the Republic's diversity. The music was an electronic beat that was mellow. There seemed to be an old human lady working the bar at the moment. Awne saw Woroken walk in a few minutes after her.
**Kiernan's Office**
Sergeant Vor'en strolled down the busy hallways of the 22nd floor. He looked up and down when finally he arrived at the Major's door. He hit the door chime and awaited a response. A voice spoke out from the door control.
Major Kiernan: "Yes?"

"Staff Sargent Vor'en reporting as ordered Sir." he said with practiced ease, and waited for the door to open and be allowed to enter.
When the door slid open he moved in the Majors office. Moving with the military style that looked as practices as firing his weapon. He stands at attention, snaping a salute and keeping it there until returned.

Awne looks around the room before eyeing the booth "how about grabbing a booth huh Kaz?" Her ear twitches to sounds, glancing behind her she wave to the wookiee, pointing to the booth before moving to follow the Ewok, taking a seat next to him and waiting for the wookiee to take a seat as well.
"What to get...something warm would be nice, and...food like.."

Walking to the starshade, Warrant Officer Kierlin inpects the ravaged exterior of the ship, hands behind his back he boards the vessel and looks for the nearest uniformed personell, seeing a bothan in uniform he approaches reading his nametag and rank quickly " Pvt Kelto I'm Warrant Officer Kierlin, I couldnt help but overhear how you spoke to Seargeant Seres, from your words I'd assume you're a contractee, and as long as your contract is binding I'll remind you to respect your superiors. I understand you've just returned from a classified mission and from the looks of if it didnt go exactly as planned (referenceing the multiple stretchers he'd seen leave in no hurry from the ship) but if it happens again I'll have your contract voided and you removed from this ship. Now to more pressing matters I need to speak with Seargeant Vo'ren. "

**Major Kiernan's Office**
The door to the office slid open and Vor'en briskly walked in. His military bearing had not dulled too much as he walked into the small office to render a salute to his commanding officer. Major Kiernan responded in turn and stood behind his desk, rendering a salute back to the sergeant. He then took his seat. The major was a human that had aged well. He had a high crewcut that was black and his face was ivory. His facial features were rigid and definitely screamed of commanding demeanor. His uniform was the distinctive officer type. It was a beige vest that encased a white long-sleeved blouse. The belt on it had a brass centerpiece and was shining as bright as gold. The light blue pants had military creases that went down to his polished black dress shoes.
Behind his desk, there was a giant blue flag with a New Republic symbol on it. There were two more flags flanking the desk of the 31st Marine unit and then a NRDF symbol. It was decorations becoming of a true patriot. The room had a small viewport to open space on the left side. The room was gray and kept clean with smooth, polished floors. The desk he had was cluttered with flimsiplast.
The Major moved the papers aside and hit a button on his black desk control panel. The room suddenly became brighter.
Major Kiernan: "At ease! Welcome home Sergeant. Did you get a chance to eat? Anyways..down to business. I want a quick debrief. Tell me about your objectives accomplished or failed, your actions on the objective, and any casualties you might have taken."

Breaking out in a laugh might have been somewhat inappropriate, so Gor decided to hold it in. Instead he merely smiled at the Warrant Officer in front of him.
"Fair enough. I meant no disrespect to the sergeant, which I am sure *he* understood. I was merely wondering if there was something special he wanted the military personell among us for, because if that was the case I would no longer be necessary. Which would mean I could go deliver some intelligence reports I beleive might have some value. You couldn´t direct me to a communications console, could you?"

Vor'en does as ordered his hands move behind his back. "We retrieved information on the Falsoor factory there and where able to secure a data core of which is stowed in the Starshade now. We also brought a couple of civilians with us that request aid for there family and friends on planet. One is in security for Falsoor. We lost Master Lorhas, and members of my squad in actions with hostiles on planet mostly driod and wild humans. We where not able to bring back Mur Eva. We ran into a Sithlord name of Strife. He appeared to be running on had taken over the facility for his own use. The LT was also among the dead sir. she died when the ship crashed landed due to unforseen reasons." Vor'en tries to keep a professional manner whille giving his report to his commanding officer.

Woro walked into the unexpectedly busy cantina, and caught the furry forms of Kaz and Awne grabbing an unoccupied booth. He quickly followed, grabbing a chair next to the two. "Hey guys," he said, "Anyone got a menu?" He hadn't had real food in a while and was very much looking forward to it.
"And this is yours," he presents the broken saber to Awne, "I didn't know if you would want to make a new one or repair this one." As he says this, his eyes hit Awne's 'new' right arm. "That's amazing,' he blurts out, not being able to help from staring.

Major Kiernan: "So...The Jedi's initial suspicions were correct...Falsoor is up to no good. I was skeptical myself about following their lead. But the Lieutenant crashed your ship and died? There was no comm from her or anything in the ships logs as to why it went down? What happened to the rest of your squad mates? Sergeant I know you didn't ask for the LT's job but now you are accountable. This was supposed to be recon, quick and fast. In and out."

Kaz'jee had grabbed the booth for Awne and was very pleased to finally be able to sitand relax. Ah this was the lifge, friends, peace, and hopefully good food and drin. He was very unaccustomed to any form of alcohol however. He then noticed the empty stage..and shuddered. True the Ewok had a talent, but he was oh so very shy in front of complete strangers...even shy in front of his new friends. A sort of nervous fiddling with his hands would be noticed by both Wookie and Farghul, and anyone else who happened to look his way.
Worro's words jerk him from his thoughts however, and now noticing the person in question present, he smiles and makes room for him to sit. "Big Fuzzy amazed too? Awne very lucky yes?" He pats her arm, the old one, and sighs. "What to drink? Dont care too much what type of food...not picky." His eyes however keep going back to the stage...how drunk would the Ewok be in order to get up and sing...
It is then that his eyes graze across the broken lightsaber. He tugs quickly at Awne's shoulder and says quietly "If...If Awne no want...Kaz'jee have please?" His eyes were pleading to the Farg'hul with an immense want and urgency to possess something so beautiful as that glow-stick.

Scooting in beside the ewok, Woro nods in thanks at being welcomed to the table. "You okay, Kaz'jee? You seem nervous," Woro notes, seeing the little fidgety ewok looking all over the cantina. "You're not in any trouble are you?" he asks turning around to scan the bar for anyone casting an unkind gaze toward his little friend. Seeing no one, Woro's attention turned again to his empty stomach, "I think I could finish off a rancor."

Awne chuckles to the two 'fuzzys' beside her, looking down to the new arm "I still can't believe my body was capable of such a thing..it's rreally astounding." She shakes her head and leans back into her seat "I could use some good food, maybe cold..salads are cold...a big salad...like the size of you." she pokes the Ewok with a grin, she was feeling better, happier to get off the planet though she tried not to think about it; thinking about it brought up thoughts of Mur and her wellbeing and Lorhas being gone, as well as the two cubs.
She shakes her head and looks to the bar "I need a drrink...that frruity thing I had when we firrst met..rrememberr that Worro?" she says while taking her saber, glancing to the Ewok "Tell you what..if I can't fix it and have to build a new one, I'll let you have some of the parrts." She taps it "The crrystal's mine though."

"I am aware of that sir. I tried to contact the LT over comms to inform her of what was happening on the ground. I got no responce and then the Starshade crashed near us." "We could not find a reason for the crash. We had encountered hostiles and call for evac to a safe location and then the ship crashed. As far as the others they where killed in fighting with driods security forces and a Sith warrior." Everything was playing back in his mind his men dieing, the shot that almost killed him.

Major Kiernan: "Now Sergeant you sound a little strung out right now. I'll give you some time to rest and think it over. I have a lot of families to inform so I'll need a detailed mission report on my desk by 0600 tomorrow. I'll also need intelligence you gathered on Vjun turned at the intel shop tonight. You can expect intel personnel to be getting sworn statements from everybody who was in the field with you. I got to send this to the big man so I'll need more details."

Eyes looked straight to the wookie but shakes his head quickly "No..No not in trouble. Nervous...Stage is empty...and Kaz'jee wants to go sing...but.." He blushes and looks down "Kaz'jee think it bad idea...too many that Kaz'jee does not know...and...and song isnt finished yet." The last bit was a lie. He really did not like lying to his friend, even if it was one of embarrassment and anxiety...but what was a nervous Ewok to do.
At the mention of salad, the Ewok's mouth watered slightly and nods his head in agreement. "Salad...with meat....mmm..." His features took on a dazed look about them but quickly snaps out of it when she had made mention of the lightsaber again. "Kaz'jee have crystal though...maybe make it work for me..." It was his first time referring to himself out of the third person, but he seemed to take no note of this. "Kaz'jee wish...to be fighter like Awne and Worro...."

Kaz'jee looks with a bit of skepticism at the wookie's words and sure enough, Awne had confirmed that she would not help sing. However..this -did- give him an idea. "Awne no sing...but...but maybe she can dance yes?" He looks to her with pleading eyes "Kaz'jee no want to be alone...please Awne?" He looks back to Worro now "Training room for what? Snging or..or fighting..."
At hearing Awne's exasperation the Ewok takes it upon himself to stand up in the booth and take in a deep breath before yelling out at the top of his lungs "**Service please?? Over here!**" He then sits down and blushes with a soft giggle. "Maybe that work?"

Awne laughs at the display of the Ewok, feeling far more relaxed with the two furry beings now then she had the entire trip.
It worked though as a woman scurries to the table, young and brunette she was ready to take orders. A muffled word that sounded suspiciously like 'finally' escapes the farghuls lips, her tail curling faintly under the table at the prospect of food.
"I'd like anything sweet that has any amount of alcohol in it, and something vegetarian the size of him." she points to the Ewok as a reference for size. It was anyone's guess if she was serious or not.

"I would like..." the wookiee began, noticing the waitress's blank expression. He quickly scanned the customers of the cantina, found the largest piece of meat anyone ordered. He pointed toward it, and pointed to himself. The waitress picked up on the gesture and rushed back to the kitchen to prepare the orders.
"We can practice singing and fighting, if you would like Kaz," Woro said, smirking. The little fellow was just the pick-me-up the Jedi needed right now. "Maybe you could show Awne how to dance while we wait, Kaz."

Kaz'jee freezes when Worro had suggested helping explain to Awne how to dance. He himself didnt know how to dance...but yet he had seen and even heard of the technique, for lack of a better term. He looks to Awne and says with a straight face "No worry Awne...Only thing to remember is...how was said...hrm...All in the hips?" He thinks for a minute before "Yes...hips and chest." He then starts to hum a few notes and nods, pleased. "Kaz'jee think he can do it.." He gets himself ready and pauses before starting out slow and soft, and sings a lullaby that his mother used to sing to him. It was about the rivers and the streams...how they all one day turned into each other and sometimes into something bigger...and how the water was a giver of food and life. Once he was done he looks t them both and says quietly "Other song...one Kaz'jee made...is...faster than that one...more...excentric is word? It is about...recent trip we took..."

Awne rests her head on the table, banging her head faintly, how did she get roped into dancing? she couldn't dance...she could fight, she knew very well how to fight but dancing was a lesson she never asked of her father and never wanted.
Her head turns towards the Ewok, listening to the tune, she relaxed, letting her eyes close at the images of home that rushed through her mind. Home with her father, the trees, the river, her favorite place...her heart ached, she missed home for once. Ever since joining the team she had been missing home more and more...was it the sense of family they brought of the want of the family in her heart?
Or maybe it was just female emotions...yea...that could be too. "That was beautiful Kaz.."

Kaz'jee gulps but looks to the stage before nodding to Worro "Oh...Okay....Kaz'jee...guna...go." He shakily makes his way to the stage and clears his throat "Umm...okay...Kaz'jee can do this..." he mumbles to himself before cursing in Ewokese. A few more deep breaths before he starts singing about how he was lost in the dark, alone and helpless...about how by chance he found his friends...and the deal they made. He sang about how the deal seems to be forgotten, but he doesnt mind...because he feels he has found a place just as good as home. It was all done in his language of course, but the melody still sounded as heavenly as an angel's voice. When he finishes, he looks to Worro and Awne to see their reaction...and hopes he can get off the stage quickly.

**The Drifter**
In the cantina that was becoming livelier by the minute, the ewok worked his way through the crowd of Republic patrons. Every creature seemed to be taller and it was sort of intimidating as he made his way to the stage. The bartender gets light of this and turns off the music, while putting a light on the ewok.
At first, none of the patrons seemed to pay attention. But once the ewok's voice began cutting over the noise, the crowd started murmuring. A few seconds after this, the crowd was stunned by Kaz's song. He hit low notes and high notes, creating an epic ballad that would soothe a rancor. The faces of the Republic soldiers was that of bewilderment and shock. He controlled his voice with professional precision and tone. Once it came near a close, he managed to pull off the last note without going over the top.
A stunned silence followed by a round of applause ensued. Instantly, the Republic people started gathering around the wondrous ewok and asked him a hail of questions. Woroken's applause was drowned out by the glorious reception. Awne could not even see little Kaz 'Jee anymore.
After the night of drinking, everyone goes back with their hero of song. Everyone in the ship does their respective duties then goes to sleep. Sergeant Vor'en gets up earlier than anyone and turns in his report at 0600.
Overall, the week goes by slowly with most of the Vjun combatants resting and taking it easy. Feldon Azrik keeps the group informed that he is unaware of Mur Eva's whereabouts but he is working on potential leads by the intel gathered on Vjun. The entire Vjun party is briefed they will have an intelligence briefing on a date to be determined. As it stands right now, no one has seen or heard from Kardoon. Everyone wakes up bright and early on a new day after being on the ship for roughly one week total. Everyone has been assigned personal quarters.
*Kaz gains 300 XP and a +1 Fame bonus to charisma-related checks while on the Dark Stallion for a month. Roommates are as follows; Awne and Feldon, Woroken by himself, Vor'en and Sergeant Seres, Gor 'Ak and Starfell, Aymaric and Kaz, Natirash by himself. Sarin is in a holding cell.*

After he woke up, he cleaned up and dressed for the day. He straped on his blaster and headed for breakfast. He walks down the corridor toward the mess hall. Everything went good with his report cause he was still here and they hadn't handed him his walking papers. All and all good if losing friends on missions was a good thing. Maybe he would run into one of his squad on the way to the mess hall.

Listening to the Ewok sing was astounding. She was in awe, who knew that sound could come from that little body.
When the song finished the amount of people that too felt the awe caused a twinge of panic as they conformed around the stage. She had to stand up in the booth to try and see her friend and even then it wasn't enough.
Frowning catches sight of a small fuzzy form moving through the crowd and to their table, making her sigh with relief as she sits back down, helping the Ewok back to the table so he could enjoy his meal.
"That was amazing..." she says to him, nudging him lightly "completely amazing."
~~~~~~~~~~~
With the meal over and the three moving off to the rooms she was content and happy and looking forward to sleeping in a nice warm bed. passing by the doors to the other rooms she waves off Kaz and Woro with wishes for good dreams, a meaningful look towards the wookiee as she knew he and her master would be the most likely to have nightmares of their friends death. She didn't doubt nightmares would find her too.
Entering her room she looks around for her roommate before moving to the bed to sit, her head in her hands with a sigh

The week passes for the fargul with little to report, daily routines, training with the Ewok, and trying to figure out time to set aside for working on her saber. At the com buzz from Vor'en she sighs and prepares to meet with him.

Woro had spent the week in training. He used one of the training rooms to get in a ton of lightsaber practice with Awne, and had gotten back into his meditation routine. He felt as if he had made gains in the avenue as well. The Force had seemed to embrace him more and more, and he had began practicing a technique that Lorhas had spoken to him about in the past--attempting to use his ability with the Force to interfere with a Dark sided users Force connection. Of course, he could only practice this in theory, since there was no dark sider around, unless you counted the jailed behemoth. Woro wanted to be prepared the next time he encountered the Sith, so he could keep him from using his power as much as possible.
Upon receiving the missive from Leus, Woro immediately buzzed back and said that he would attend. He wasn't quite sure how to keep the others from revealing what had happened. Maybe Vor might leave out the part about the Sith, but he had his orders, and Woro doubted he could change his mind.

Putting down the holorecorder, datacards, code cylinder, and other stuff containing the information from Vjun, the Bothan got up and ready to leave, as he passed Vor'en he stopped for a moment.
"Fine, I´ll act more professional. But while you´re at it, remind them I was contracted to assist your team on your missions, not to be their servant. I´ll treat them nicely if they treat me the same, but I don´t see them as my superiors, because they aren´t, not in my eyes.

Heading to the comm center, Gor settles down in front of the system. While he was working to establish a secure channel, he thought about secrets, and the ones he were keeping from the ones that had become his friends. He wondered how they´d react when he told them what he had seen. He wasn´t really sure what he had seen had been real, though, so he planned to talk it rhough with Feldon before he told the rest. For all he knew, perhaps he wasn´t the only one who knew.
Some secrets though, would never be revealed, he decided, as he checked around to make sure he was alone in the room.

He had grown into a habit since they had returned to the ship of only carrying his lightsaber with him, and nothing else as far as equipment goes.

Vor'en keeping his blaster pointed at Gor. "What are you doing?!? I thought you where get the info I asked about" Turning to the security guard that enter with him. "Secure the data pad and holorecorder. Also secure Gor and take him to the brig he can keep Sarin company." This didnot look good for his team mate at all. "We need a Tech in here to check the Comm gear and find out what was going on." Turning back to Gor. "Well I am waiting. What where you doing?"

Awne moves behind Vor'en taking the right side and flicking her tail for the Ewok to stay behind her.
At the sight of the bothan, the one that had shot into her duel and hit her no less, she was to say the least surprised, and not thrilled.
A frown marrs her features as she stands at the ready, though she watches his every move like the feline-sentient being that she was.

"Unlawful computer tampering? How can I be accused of that, when the blasted thing didn´t object to me logging in and preparing a message? It just randomly started to beep at me. Sounds like a malfunction to me"
He looked over at Vor'en.
"Yeah, I was working on that, but the things was quite scrambled...might have something to do with all the freaky things that went on down there. Anyway, I know a guy who is really good at that sort of things, so I thought to send it to him to have it fixed. Check the message for yourself. Oh, and don´t mind if the text sounds weird to you...I met him back when I was with the Spynet, and we kind of like talking in code"
He looks back to the officer.
"Sorry about the whole blackout thing, but I thought it would be beneficial for the mission. Besides, I´m no novice at these kinds of transmissions, no one would have noticed that. But place me in custody if you want to, and take the stuff we recovered on Vjun, but I´d like to know what kind of authoritry you have to take my personal effects"

A little suprised actually, that he had a weapon trained on him, Gor merely smiled, confident that the other wouldn´t shoot. Every nerve in the Bothan´s body was on edge though, ready to dive to the side should the shot come. The smile came from a somewhat deeper understanding of how that warrant officer worked. He seemed to be the kind that was used to just getting what they wanted because of who they were, that they never knew how to act when someone talked up to them.
"Well, well, some show of balls you´ve got there, pal. That only works if you are ready to fire a lethal bolt though, and I don´t think you are. I´m pretty sure someone would be quite mad at you for sinking a bolt into the comm console here, are you ready to take hat risk?"

## Re: The Dark Stallion

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-12-21 14:57:13)

Gor's story seemed believable to some people, and it apparently had created hesitation amongst the ranks.
Nevertheless, two of the Republic guards clad in white and armor stepped forward out of the formation. One trooper shouted a command.
Guard 1: "Hands behind your head!"
Once they saw Gor comply a human guard advanced to the bothan and swiftly took his pistol, taking his only weapon.
Guard 2: "Lay down on your stomach, hands to the side and legs stretched apart. Face away from my voice!"
The two guards were at a ninety degree angle of each other. So if one had to shoot the search man could back away safely and not get hit. The man who was going to conduct the search placed his knee into Gor's back and placed binders on him. The guard then patted down the prone bothan and threw all the items to the feet of the bystanders. After he was stripped of all items the search gave another command. The guard was being firm but gentle enough to not cause Gor any serious pain. They were doing this exercise by the numbers it seemed.
Guard 2: "Stand!"
Guard 1: "Recognize you are not under arrest. You are being detained for safety and investigation purposes. You will be released of detainment pending no incriminating evidence is found."
The guard team promptly escorted the bothan out of the room and escorted him to a holding cell.
*If you want to resist at any point Gor you may do so. These actions are only completed if you do nothing to resist. Otherwise, you are taken to the cell with no problems.*

Not really feeling the need to resist these guards - they behaved civilized at least - Gor did nothing to resist them. He followed along as they escorted him to a holding cell. as they were about to leave him, he called out to one of them.
"Hey, could you do me a favor and call the Jedi, Feldon, here? There´s something I need to tell him"
Waiting for Feldon´s possible appearance, Gor sat down and relaxed. Things seemed to be going ok. He couldn´t find anything crippling he had left behind, and he could speak for himself. If they should bother to check with his contact, he would corraborate his story.

Awne was not thrilled to say the least. The story was believable but after his shooting into the fray on the planet, of which she'd yet to forgive him, she wasn't sure anymore what to believe.
As the bothan is led out she turns to the others "something isn't rright herre..." she frowns all the more "is he telling the trruth orr is he playing us all? He said he use to worrk forr Spynet..what if he's still worrking forr them?"

## Re: The Dark Stallion

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-12-21 19:18:29)

**TIME: 0904**
The bothan was escorted by the two guards via turbolift and corridor travel. Many of the navy personnel were making odd faces at the event unfolding. Some of them were even giving dirty looks at the man, as if he was definitely a criminal. It was possible that some knew of his intention to send a transmission during comm blackout and jeopardize their mission.
After a fairly short trip, the guards check in with respective detainee personnel and log in the incident. They walk through a door down a small prison cell. The cells were ray shielded and he only saw two prisoners. One of them was Sarin. The guard pushes some buttons on a control panel and lets the bothan in.
There was only a waste disposal unit and a cot in his cell. So, Gor had no privacy.
Guard 1: "Visitors have to be approved. Who did you want to see again?"
The guard turned on the ray shield and slung his weapon.
After about an hour, Vor'en receives a comlink buzz from Sergeant Seres. The comm techs had reported that the computer was accessed by Gor 'Ak, but they weren't to recover anything else.

As he was being placed in the holding cell, Gor was glad to hear at least that visitors was allowed.
"Feldon, the Jedi. You can tell him it concerns our missing Jedi on Vjun"
With little more to do, Gor settled down in a cross-legged position, performing one of his usual calming and relaxing exercises. After all, he had little else to do. He was a little concerned however at the dark faces he had seen Awne shoot him. She seemed mad at him for some reason. The only thing he could think of was that he had shot her on Vjun. Sure, that was quite the reason to be mad at someone, but how could she have known it was him, after all the care he had taken to make his shot - and himself - completely invisible. Well, no use wondering over that now, she was a Jedi and maybe she had her ways. He made a mental note though to apologize the next time he saw her. It had all just been a terrible accident after all.

"Of course, Master," the wookiee told Feldon before signing off the channel. He was surprised to hear Feldon's misisve that he and Awne were being considered as Jedi Knights. That made him miss Master Lorhas even more, as he was sure Lorhas must have brought that up to someone before their recent mission. No matter the result, he again noted to himself that he would continue to make Lorhas proud of him, as he knew his Master as part of the Force now, was watching him.
He walked down the hall, stopping in front of Gor's holding area. He presented himself to the guards and asked to be allowed to speak with the prisoner.

He was telling him that they wheren't able to retrive what Gor had sent. "Thank you Sgt. Seres. I would go through Gor gear he has it some where. I took the rest of the gear I found to Intel for them I will be on the flight deck working on the Starshade. Vor'en out.". Still fumming he needed to find someone to talk to. Maybe he would check on what needed repaired on the Starshade. He was mad, someone who he trust may have just betrayed that trust. Gor a man he trusted had done something that betrayed that trust and he needed to find an out let for his rage.
He stops in his quarters grabs his coveralls and heads to the flight deck to start working on the Starshade. using his comm. "Red Team I will be on the flight deck if you need me. Vor'en out." His words are cold and unforgiving. He heads to the flight deck.

Do I have to keep them busy?! Your soldier is a Class 5 security violator. That is punishable by 10 years hard labor and/or confinement. I ran a great crew before your type was injected onto my ship.

"Of course Admiral. We went to V'jun to see what Falsoor was up to. We found the planet in ruins and a Sithlord had taken over. The information on the data pad is of the cloning research dealing with Force users. Mur eva the Jedi that we where trying to rescue was a result of those experiments. The information is about growing an army of Jedi. It would worth a fortune to whoever had it and could sell it." The rest of the info on the mission is in my report."

**Major Kiernan's office**
Admiral Ordani: "So you all hit the proverbial jackpot of dirt on Falsoor? There is information regarding cutting edge cloning technology, which is illegal, on how to construct Force-wielding soldiers... and your marine gave this classified information up?! And why was such a low pay grade able to walk around with this stuff when usually those types get minimal responsibility? We'll all be buried...not to mention we've possibly let information leak that could one day fall into the wrong hands. If this information is legitimate, then your Private is a suspect of espionage and treason. These are both punishable by death."
The admiral walks over to Sergeant Vor'en and rips his rank off his uniform.
Admiral Ordani: "You are hereby demoted for lack of discipline and failure to control top secret information. You are effectively a Corporal. Major, you handle the paperwork."
The woman was seething now and was apparently thinking of her next move.
Admiral Ordani: "Gentlemen you've left with me little options. I understand you run low profile operations but now this is my problem. I want you to get this information out of your soldier who he was sending this intelligence to. I want to know WHY he was sending it. We already know it was him that tampered with the computer. Now, you all have a lot of work to do. I suggest you get to it! Keep a lid on these proceedings and don't let this stuff float around any more. We've already compromised greatly what you all fought and died for...I'd expect you all to waste no time in undoing this disgrace. Dismissed!"

Vor'en snaps to and takes the punishment. "Yes Ma'am!" he snaps a quick salute to the Adrimal. He had been in worse situations before. it still stung though. He exits out of the Majors office and straight to the holding cells. He was going to get the information out of Gor one way or another.

**Cell Block 1: Time 1104**
Sergeant Vor'en arrived to the Cell Blocks after a short walk. The guard on duty patrolling the block took the man's weapon for security purposes and allowed Vor'en to continue his business. Apparently, Woroken and Gor 'Ak were in conversation as he approached his ray-shielded section. Sarin was also watching the events quite closely.

Vor'en turns and looks at Gor. "You traitorous Di'kut! You betrayed me and the team for what credits?! If the guard hadn't taken my sidearm you would be dead on the deck now." The words came out full of venom. "Go on Gor, tell Woro that you where going to sell the information that we collected on V'jun. Tell him that his Master, my friend died for nothing. That you betrayed the man that saved your life back there! Go on tell him!" Vor'en's fist slams into the ray shield that was between him and Gor.

"Whoa there sarge. Remember how I told you a few times to calm down back on the planet? Well, this seems like a similar moment. Breathe, breathe..."
Sighing deeply, the Bothan drew a hand through the fur in his face.
"Now, I haven´t betrayed anyone, and I can assure you it would take far more than just credits to make me do that. And no, I wasn´t going to sell that information to anyone. Has it even occured to you that there might be a hint of truth to what I told you? Or at the very least that we should await the outcome of this so called "investigation" before we start assigning blame and executing people? But perhaps being back around all the stiff-shirts of the military machine has taken away your ability to think for yourself, and you automatically swallow everything they feed you?"
Leaning back against the wall of his cell, Gor´s eyes lingered a little longer on Vor'en.
"Now if you can just shut up and listen for a moment, I was talking to Woro about something, and I´m guessing you´ll be wanting to hear this as well. But once again, take a deep breath first"
Demonstratively taking a deep breath himself, he turned back to Woro.
"From the looks of things, a bad one. Like I said, I was sleeping, but I woke up flying through the air after being attacked by some kind of beast in the vision. But I guess the thing you´ll be interested in is that I saw Mur Eva. I didn´t see much of her, but she seemed to be ok, and locked in a cell not unlike this one"

First Awne, and now Gor were having visions of Mur Eva. Woro wondered if Gor was going to start having black out episodes like Awne did as well. Shaking his head to clear his throughts, Woro immediately realized this was something that Feldon needed to know about after all. Gor's latent power was strong enough for Mur Eva to perhaps tap into to send a sort of message. The wookiee suspected that Feldon would want to keep Gor very close to the team to keep him monitored.
"Gor, try not to get yourself beaten to a pulp for a little while. I am going to talk to Feldon and one of us will get back to you." Woro hadn't seen Vor this angry in a long time, perhaps ever. He patted the old soldier on the back, and turned and walked out of the holding area.
He immediately headed towards Feldon's quarters. He did not feel comfortable talking about visions of Mur Eva over the channels. He wanted to see Feldon face to face. Once he got to Feldon's area, he buzzed for entry at the door.

Vor'en looks at Gor. He still has that killer look in his eye. "There are ways to handle things here Gor. You could have came to me about this, we could have went through channels went to the Major if it was that important. If you are a Force user I could have to talked to Feldon and Lues for you." Taking a calming breath. "Because of your actions I was demoted. You could sent to Kessel for all we know. Why did not just come to me with what you had we could have done something different. Now the Admiral is involved I may not be able to help you." Vor'en starts to pace in front of Gor's cell. "Did you not trust me?"

Awne frowns as it seemed by the look the Ewok was giving her at the simple mention of the crystal in his possession that she wasn't going to get that one.
Sighing and setting down the broken saber on the bed, then hiding it under the pillow for good measure, the farghul decides to ask her wookiee friend if he had a spare, if he didn't....she sighs again, she didn't want to have to ask her master for a spare, she didn't think he carried one, and odds were she'd have to go find one somewhere; which she believed was going to be the outcome anyway.
No matter, she had taken the short time of looking over her saber to think things through about the traitorous Bothan, seeing as that was probably where she might find the wookiee she leads the way to the cells.
Tail curled as it sways she enters after a nod to the guards; to her surprise she finds wookiee and Sargent; and traitor, as he had become in her mind, and sith. Frowning faintly she moves into the room, offering a nod to the Sith, she had to admit if it hadn't been for him picking up the Ewok they might have lost him, indeed that big monster had come in handy.
She moves to the Sargent's side, resting a hand on his shoulder in a calming manner, it looked as though the human needed it with his expression. "Sarrin, you look well. Vorr...you do not." she turns to the wookiee and bothan next "Worro, when you have a moment? ...Trraitorr you'rre still alive."

"Now, Awne, we don't know that Gor is a traitor. I still think there may be some explanation for this. The investigation will show what is true," he said to his friend. Woro had decided that until there was some evidence of guilt shown that he was going to believe what Gor had said, but would tread carefully around him for the time being. "We'll be back soon, Gor."
He turned to Awne, nodded to the exit imploring her to follow him. Any question she had would be better to hear outside of the ears of everyone else for now. What's up, Awne? You look troubled," he said, noticing the serious expression she held.

I mean I didn't take much stock in disaplain on planet, only when it was needed. The others trust me to help them out and back them. Why not you?" He lets out a long breath. "You fool, I would have back you on anything you wanted to do if you would have just followed channels. That is what they are in place for Gor. To keep out of trouble. Now I just don't know what could be done to help you out. Well I have an inspection to get ready for and a ship that needs repaired." He turns to leave. "If I was you I would learn to follow orders and cooperate with them it may save you." With that he heads out of the hold cells getting his side arm on the way out.

Awne frowns but follows the wookiee "Forrgive me if I do not trrust him." she crosses her arms over her chest. She was falling back into old habits more and more, reverting almost to what she was like as a bounty hunter...that seemed almost a lifetime ago now to her. "He's a quick talkerr and worrks forr spynet he said, I do not trrust that in the least."

Somewhat overwhelmed by all the activity around his cell now, Gor wasn´t sure who to answer first. But since she had shown up out of nowhere, he decided it could be best to at least try to apologize to Awne.
"That would be "worked for the Spynet", Awne, implying I quit their service some time ago. And I did, I preferred to live the free life of a bounty hunter. And since you´re here, let me just say how sorry I am about what happened on Vjun. I was confident I could pull it off, I´ve done it before, but you guys were moving much faster than I expected. Even if you don´t beleive anything else, at least trust me when I say I´m really sorry about that"
With that out of the way, he turned back to the Wookie and Vor'en only to watch the human walk away. He decided it was for the best though, and didn´t call out for him, instead he looked to Woro again, this time with a slight look of surprise on his face. The Force? Did they really beleive he had the power of the Force within him? And all this time he just thought he had exceptional skills...

Vor'en heads for supply to see about replacing his gear that was damaged on mission. As he walks he thinks about what had happened on mission and after. Nothing he could think of would make Gor do what he did. He had to realize how it would make him look if he got caught, which he did and now everyone on the team was taking it for his actions.
When he reaches supply he makes his way to the supply Sargent and salutes him. "I need to replace my flack vest and carbine. What do I need fill out or talk to?" if he could not tell Vor'en was not in the greatest of moods.

"We'll be back, Gor, don't go anywhere," the wookiee said with a snort. He knew Gor would be safe here while everything was resolved. Safe, unless Vor got into the cell with him, that is.
"Let's go, Awne," he says walking to an area well outside of hearing range of the bothan. "I'm not sure how much I trust him either, but I think we need to give him the benefit of the doubt. The Sith seemed to want him dead just as much as the rest of us, that's for sure. If the evidence is there, it;'ll come out. His explanation sort of makes sense...if he was trying to get the info translated." He then remembered Awne's question. "No, I don't have an extra crystal, unfortunately. I'd stay away from the one we gave Kaz to keep, though. It seemed to do dark things to those who held it."
Thinking back to the bothan, Woro asked another question. "Awne, have you had any more visions of Mur Eva since you met the Sith?"

Kaz'jee think if Gor was telling truth...Awne be going funny too." He nods before taking aim at Awne's tail and swatting at it a few times.
The question about the crystal still burned within hi smind....why should he let her have it when it had been known to possibly cause her problems by making her go crazy? he would keep it safe just as he had been...though then again...his apparent....but secret dislike for the bothan could make for some interesting scenario's.

"I can't explain to you why I like Gor. I just have a feeling there is more to him than meets the surface. I can't explain it more than that, unfortunately. Anyway, let's go talk to Feldon. He knows alot more about the Force than we do, and maybe he can sort this out. Do you remember if you ever spoke of your visions of her in front of him, Awne?

**Armory: Time 1127**
Corporal Vor'en walks through the armory doors and approaches the counter. There was weapon racks set up behind the counter and a ray-shielded back room. A lone M-3P0C was set up behind the counter, and he seemed to be idle until the veteran walked into the room. Most of the people on the ship called him CJ.
CJ: "Yes sir. I have the equipment you need right here. But do try to take care of these ones. I will need a field loss report at your leisure."
The droid deactivated the ray shield and returned with a basic Republic carbine and blast vest. It was the same cheap CDEF brand weapon he had lost on Vjun. The flak jacket he received was brand new and sturdy.
While the Corporal was filling out the equipment forms a comlink buzz came in from the Major.

So I need you to designate a lead investigator...someone level-headed and good with words. I understand your shore party might not be qualified but we can't afford any more leaks. Perhaps one of your Jedi? And I caught wind that you had a gear inspection at 1330. You need to have your investigator get sworn statements about Gor 'Ak's character at the gear inspection. We're on our own in this case. I expect you to do what's necessary to bring justice in this matter. More details will come to you as I am briefed. Are we clear, Corporal?"

I've heard that he was caught hacking into a restricted area, and there isn't much that would make me believe he wasn't guilty of something wrong. If you discover one thing wrong, it is likely you should go deeper into the matter in situations like this. But as far as Jes goes, I'm not so sure he'd make that up. If he did...what could be the reason? The Force is with him and we did go into a lot of turmoil over her...so it is perfectly understandable for him to see visions of the woman.

"Then there was the battle with the Sithlord Strife that he almost died try to get at something, never did figure that out. He is reckless and nonprofessional to a fault, for someone in his field I find it a little strange that he would be employed for very long."
Vor'en tell Kierlin what he needs to know in order to do his job. " The next question should be how are we going to find out who he was sending it to. The transmission had to be tagged to someone? Getting that out of him maybe more of a challenge. I could call Lues or Feldon in on this but I don't think they would help get the info."

Thinking for a moment " Well he profess's his innocence enough, he should just come right out and say it as of right now whoever he sent it to is going to be the only one that can prove he didnt do anything wrong, if he refuse's or gives us a bad contact it'll just make him look that much more guilty, I'm sure if he isn't cooperative, intel can track down where it was sent to.

The shore party slowly but surely dragged their equipment across the smooth and durable floor to the hangar. They arranged their items for display next to the OD green LAAT/i. Even the Jedi padawans courteously showed up to have the Warrant Officer check over their items. There was also a rumor that some investigative questions were going to be asked.

I need statements from you all of everthing your comrade was doing, most notably anything suspicious or unusually reckless, I understand he's friends with some of you and thats why I'm leading the investigation as I'm impartial. Second I want you all to go through your gear and find any items that are damaged or you would like to upgrade and make a list. Any items you think would help you do your job's more effectivley should also go on that list and I'll see what I can get for you. Any questons ?"

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Awne was one unhappy farghul, she had yet to find a crystal for her saber which meant she couldn't rebuild hers which also meant she needed to find a new one and good luck to her with that...and on top of it all she had to write that she had not seen anything about the bothans force powers, and had to go on second hand accounts as she was not present when the bothan had related his dream.
She sighs faintly as she watches the inspection, she'd have to rely on her vibrodagger then.
She fidgets beside the wookiee, she needed to get in some practice then if that was the case.

Why did you attempt to use the HoloNet when it is a known restricted action? Why did you do this when we are a under class 5 operation?

He cleared his throat a bit, and then continued.
"Had I remembered that we were under such a tight wrap, I probably wouldn´t have attempted to make the transmission I did. But it was just like I told sergeant Vor'en, I was attempting to send the data we recovered from Vjun to a close friend of mine, because when I tried to process the data myself, I found it scrambled and unclear, and he is quite good at that sort of work"

Woro hated paperwork. But he completed everything requested of him. He did not list any infractions by Gor, as he was not one to judge what was overly reckless.
As far as new items to be requested, Woro couldn't think of anything he needed off the top of his head. He did request 500 credits, since he had not been able to repay Awne for her planet side loan, and would like to get things cleared up with her. Just before turning in his report, he decided to request an aquata breather. His travels hadn't taken him to an aquatic planet, but just in case, having the breather on him would allow him to operate there.

Vor'en brings his gear to the inspection everything in place and ready. his gear webbing and pack where a little worse for where and he hate his new weapon, the E-11 was far superior to the weapon he had now but a few credits might fix that.
Walking into the hanger he sees his squad non of them have noticed the new rank he had. It was lower then his usual and it might be awhile before he moved back up, but he was confident he would. he get everyone lined up and ready for the inspection. After it Kierlin had finished he asked them to fill out statements about what had happened on V'jun he complied with the Warrent Officer and filled out everything asked. When it came to the gear he gave what he wanted, better Armor, better carbine E-11 and what every else he thought was lacking most of it would not happen cause every army thought there gear was the best. So he was not going to hold his breath on it.
Vor'en addresses his team. "As all of you know Gor is being held in the brig for what he did. I for one agree with this cause he put the ship and all of us at risk. The information we obtained on V'jun is of a classified nature and will not be discussed with anyone not already in the know. Warrant Officer Kierlin will be heading the investigation into his actions. You will cooperate with him, you will be truthful about what happened on planet." Turning to Awne and Woro. "I need to know if either one of you noticed Gor using the force in anyway. I think he maybe a force user and I need to know if it is true." Back to his team. "Hopefully Gor will cooperate and this will be all over quickly. Because of his action I am going to address disaplian issues in the team. This has been brought to my attention of late by the Major and the Admiral, I failed to do my duty as your leader and have been punished for it. Don't worry it has happened before and I will live. Unless there is anything else, we all have work that is in need of doing. Dismissed."

The major shifted both arms behind his back and begun pacing around the outside of the cell. It appeared that Gor 'Ak's story was not deceiving the Major.
Major Kiernan: "So you're claiming negligence. I see. Well, I can tell you right now the negligent story is going to be near impossible to sell past any semi-competent scrutiny. You're claiming that you forgot about the comm blackout even in spite of a unauthorized user warning? There is a opening prompt that thoroughly warns of restricted use. The only way past the lock out is slicing, and you really want to go with that story? Come on kid I'm trying to help you. Even if your actions were a part of failed memory you still willingly sliced through the restricted access. That's the same classification as sending transmissions during a comm blackout. Now, think hard. Did you REALLY have your memory fail you? So bad that the unauthorized user prompt did not remind you what you were doing was wrong?"

He quickly headed out and this time, headed to see Leus. It appeared this Gor thing awas a bit more serious than he initially thought. The military was seriously pissed at the bothan and might not rest until they got a pound of his fur. He planned on asking Leus to consider talking to Feldon, and the two of them trying to get Gor released to their custody. He got to Leus's quarters and buzzed for entry.

The Bothan laughed at the major. A friendly laugh, not the kind that is just mocking and provoking, but the one you make when someone´s just told a good joke.
"Well, in all honesty, I did forget that we were in such a serious comm blackout. But yeah, I probably should have suspected something when that prompt started to flash on me. I actually took it as a challenge, probably from years in the intelligence field, and natural curiosity. Honestly though, all I did was send a transmission, that´s the truth of the day"
He sighed and drew the hands through his hair.
"I don´t suppose that helps my case very much though, does it? Very well, I guess I should tell you that my contact is not an actual person, but a state-of-the art AI that I set up a long time ago. Otherwise I would not have trusted it with information I know is so vital"

Awne glances about faintly now that they had been dismissed, moving with the wookiee to Vor'en "I haven't noticed anything...but Worro has." she looks to the wookiee "If you two will excuse me I have..." she sighs "trraining.." she mutters and leaves with the Ewok at her side.
She was mumbling to him about how she had gotten too use to her saber, which probably wasn't the best but then she hadn't ever thought that she would need a new crystal. It seemed with all the complaints and the time to think for the Ewok he had come to a conclusion that she might be able to handle the crystal in his possession.
As they walk back to the quarters he offers the crystal to her, the one that she had given him for safe keeping on the planet when it was believed that it was making her react...oddly.
The gratitude was immense if the hug was anything to go by, nearly choking the poor Ewok with it before remembering people needed to breathe. She made sure he was alright before all but skipping to hers and her masters quarters; it's here she takes out her broken saber to begin rebuilding with her new crystal; handing the old one to the Ewok as the agreed exchange.

Major Kiernan: "So, the story changes. I'll make a note of that. And the truth of the day is that you willingly breached the security measures, despite the reasoning behind it. The fact that you wished to slice the computers is the key here. Having natural curiosity or seeking challenge does not override military procedure. These reasons do not give you the justification to compromise everyone's security. So, next question. Who is this AI you were intending to send the package to? What is this AI's contact information? By law, you are required to give it to me as you are subject to a military investigation and suspected in misuse of top secret information.

**Awne's personal quarters**
The farghul apprentice observed her lightsaber and prepared the blackened but translucent crystal. Upon closer inspection, she noticed her turbine emitter had the wires severed to it. It would require some rewiring and maybe a new focusing lens. Someone would have to fix this mechanically as it was not the same as building a lightsaber with the power of the Force. She would need this done before she could install her new crystal.
**Training Room**
The Jedi gestured in respect to the wookiee's notion.
Lues Van: "Well, I've heard whispers that he was caught red-handed breaching restricted computers. That he was very reckless with the intelligence we gathered about Falsoor. So I can't really blame the Army. He's not a bad person, but a good person is also able to commit a crime. I think if you execute a crime you deserve to serve your punishment. But, if you want to give Gor 'Ak the benefit of a doubt, you have my good graces. I for one am too busy to deal with Gor's problem. Did you know that Luke Skywalker himself has taken great interest in our case? Poor Feldon is being questioned to death. Not to mention Master Luke wants to have us all commended for the way we handled the Sith Lord. He's satisfied of our actions and feels it is an example of our Order's ability to handle the Dark Side. It's a good possibility you and Awne are destined for Knighthood in the near future."
The Jedi takes a moment to pause, as if to punctuate the moment.
Lues Van: "You are ready to take the trials."
Indeed, Lues Van was mentioning the trials to become a Jedi. This was the final rite of passage an apprentice could take before becoming a knight and getting their own apprentice.

"Master Skywalker himself?" Woroken said in a low growl, which did not hide his reverential tone. He immediately felt a pang of guilt over his behavior on the planet. He wasn't sure he would ever get over not ignoring Lorhas's orders, and leaving him to face the Sith alone.
He was also thinking about the proposed trial Leus mentioned. Lorhas and he had only spoke about the trials on a very limited basis. Woro knew these were dangerous, difficult, and were designed to test him on everything he had been taught. "I am willing to be tested at your convenience," he told the Knight.

Awne sighs, hanging her head; she was never going to get this done at this rate. She breathes deeply calming herself down and taking a few moments to simply breathe, meditate on calm and relax. she could feel a few muscles in her back continue to be tense, she'd need to work on those later; carrying tension in her back she knew was a fault of hers though one couldn't seem to break.
Opening her eyes she breathes deeply and picks up the pieces to her saber and new crystal; quietly she leaves to find someone with the skills she would need to fix the wires and new lens. First stop then, she figured, would be...erm..
She pauses in the hallway, blinking a few times as she realizes she had started walking without thinking first where to go. Choices...yes, list the choices...Vor'en...he must have some kind of skill...though he was busy and she wouldn't want to bother him..who else then...she wasn't sure about the others really...so that left the personnel...they were trained to fix things so that would be her best bet in her mind.
She nods her head to herself, likely earning an odd look or two from passerby but she paid no mind and headed off, she'd just have to try that cantina that the more mechanically inclined frequented, The Rusty Frigate she believed was the name. At the least they could point her in the proper direction if they couldn't help.

"Well of course the story changes. That´s one of the oldest tricks in the book to keep an interrogator guessing, ask anyone. Disregarding that though, maybe I´ve decided to be more cooperative for a reason? Yeah, I hacked the computers, I´ll admit to that. But any half-witted technician can inform you that no harm was done to the system, and that a single transmission was attempted, nothing more. Something I feel should give at least some credence to my story, don´t you agree?"
As for the AI, it was something I cooked up in a moment of brilliance many years ago. A simple system, given tasks depending on the message entered, designed to recognize patterns in various verbal codes. It can clear corrupted data, decipher algorithms, search the holonet, and many more things. It does, however, require a certain access code to utilize, which is how I can be sure anything I send to it is perfectly safe. I will front you the contact information to contact it if you´d like, and I can even go as far as to give you some of the verbal codes used to specify its tasks, if you´d like to try it"

Taking some noting gear from the guard, Gor scrabbled down the contact info. He was quite surprised actually, that they hadn´t been able to extract that information from the transmission. Not to antagonize anyone further, he wasted no time on writing down false info, and just wrote down the exact same place his transmission had been sent to.
"There you go, that´s all you need to make contact. I put down a quick note of what the codewords are for clearing up scrambled memory banks too, just in case you want to try it out. Don´t be offended if he acts somewhat rude though, he is programmed that way"
((I don´t see why the information would require a Deception check, since I´m giving up the very same coordinates I sent the transmission to. As to the nature of the contact, I said that it was sent to a "minor employee at a small company on the Outer Rim".

*You're right, it's not a deception. I just guessed it was a creature as you did not give much details about Gor Ak's contact. Therefore, I will need specific information on this contact that you have generated. I need it's location(planet), all the organizations the droids related to, and how often you speak to it and how well it knows you. You are also not able to control this contact. I already know he's affiliated with the SpyNet because you told me so.*

The officer adjusted his beige vest and continued his conversation. It appeared as if he was ready to leave.
Major Kiernan: "Just to let you know, this droid is subject to incarceration. This is because he was the intended recipient of top secret information. He is especially accountable if he does not cooperate with us. I hope we don't have to do that. But, who knows? Finally, why did you feel it necessary to disobey Corporal Vor'en's order to turn the intelligence in and send it to this contact before you handed it to your superiors? Every Republic soldier or contractee is trained on how to handle top secret information. It should not of been sent out to anyone outside of this organization. You knew this and you broke it. For that, you are accountable. I want to know why you did it. A private who is not qualified to hold onto such things has no place in judging where that intelligence goes. This better be good or you're looking at a lot of time in a cell...or worse."

Awne traveled the length of the engine rooms and utility corridors. The various navy personnel were hard at work and the farghul could have a feeling she was not useful around here.

Opening his door he lays the armor and flight suits on the bed and takes the aquata breather and puts it in his desk drawer. Grabbing a cup of caf from his dispenser, he begins poring through the statements he got at the inspection and looking through the personel files he's gotten from Vor'en looking for any evidence Gor'ack was negligent and irresponsible and any clues to his past or current affiliations with any criminal or known intelligence communities.

After several cups of caf, Natirash see's a pattern in all the reports except for one, Gor'ak was reckless and irresponsible and failed to obey orders , he had no regard for the safety of his squadmates as proved on numerous occasions while his actions had actually gotten several of them killed, Xander, Pvt Theos and Pvt Malhaf when he ventured off on his own in a hostile area and the Jedi Master Lorhas who was killed because of Gor's inability to obey the order to retreat. The Warrant Officer came to the conclusion that if Gor didnt care enough not to put his teammates in mortal danger unnescessarily what would stop him from putting them in danger from the release of classified information, remembering that Gor'ak had admitted to being previously affiliated with the bothan spynet he decides to get some more information. Picking up the handset to the ships comm system he radios the intel office " This is Warrant Officer Kierlin, I'm heading the investigation of the comm breach yesterday and was wondering if i could get a protocol droid with some information on the Bothan spynet and anything that would be pertient to an espionage investigaion.

Their numbers strength ranges up to the thousands. They'll use what they can to get information from any place you can think of.
They are also known to not take particular sides in a conflict but they tend to benefit one side more heavily than the other. They possess a military branch and they all function as one whole to primarily benefit the bothan species. Although, they are known to have a multi-species payroll. Their help to any organization cannot be denied as they are extremely useful. It's a group that has rooted its identity deep in the galaxy.

Looking around to see if any of the guards were still around, he continued.
"I did it because I´m used to operating with a little more freedom, where people trusts you. I haven´t been in this tightly held service since my days in the 'Net, and even then it was never this tight. And frankly I had forgotten a lot about just how stiff some regulations can be, I´ve already confessed to negligence of the comm blackout. And since I´ve already told you I sent the data somewhere secure, and we haven´t been killed yet, I think they´re overreacting. Don´t they have a mission to run?"

Apparently this whole intelligence leak has greatly sparked the Admiral's interest. This whole deal about a private taking it upon himself to send intelligence of this type to a computer without clearance is no joke. Your job is to form your team up and inform the Warrant officer when your ready. I can only hope when the intelligence is analyzed it's nothing major...but from your report it sounds to be really critical. I'll brief the warrant officer at his promotion then he'll brief you. This is Republic Jurisdiction as before so feel free to let the Jedi know this. We're to be oscar mike as soon as your team is ready and you've all been briefed.

When the major entered the prison block, Gor looks at him and smiles.
"Now now Major, you are too kind. Perhaps you should thank me for finding your men some work. It seems like you´re lacking things to do out here. Otherwise why would you start all the fuzz out here, when surely the Republic have its own intelligence branch that can investigate this? It seems a far greater compromise to this missions security to launch a ship from here, than any communicative transmisions could ever be"
Clearing his throat, the bothan looks a little more serious.
"Seriously though, no chance I could tag along on this mission? I heard something about the Jedi wanting to keep check on me, and I could obviously be of some assistance on the mission.

As far as anyone else having access to the A.I. is not known at this time. I would respectfully request that the Private be aloud to return to his duties and the frist of which would be to aid in this mission. He knows what we are after and how best to deal with it."

It appears to me this intelligence has implications of catastrophic proportions just from a cursory look. We can't afford to have this suspect free when the investigation is not even completed.

Gor rolled his eyes. It had been a longshot, but you never knew. At least Vor'en had been willing to go along with it, and that put some ease on Gor's mind.
"Thanks for trying Sarge, but the man does have a point. If I may make another suggestion though, Major? Please let me out of this blasted cell, and allow me to assist your investigation from aboard the ship. Anything to speed this process up, it´s boring me to death. And what could I possibly do if I´m confined to the ship, watched by your men all the time?"
Sometime during his talk he realized that neither of the men seemed to even notice he was talking. They must have cut the sound. He sat down against the wall in his cell, sighing heavily, and drew his hands through the fur on his head. *Bureucrats*, never able to think for themselves, always having to do things exactly by the book.

He used the quiet time to think about how he might be able to help Gor out of the mess he was in, but to his displeasure, nothing sprang to his mind. Maybe the opportunity to help might come up soon. He would have to keep his eyes open.

Warrant Officer Kierlin frowned, he didnt really want to be in charge of this haphazard group, but it was an opportunity for him to climb one step higher in the chain of command " Yes sir, Understood sir. "
Making his way back to his room he stops and gets all the equipment he'd requisistioned earlier and makes his way to the hangar bay, When he arrives he puts the flight suits onboard the dropship and seeing Corporal Vor'en working on the starshad he makes his way over to him " Hey Corporal, got a present for ya, " Tossing him the tan combat jumpsuit " No luck on the E-11 though only way theres one on this ship is if someones got it stowed in they're wall locker. "

Looking down at the droid. "You do realize that this is not a military ship. It is mine." Vor'en continues wiring the comm dish.
Looking at his job and wondering why the droid would bother with checking on the Starshade when it was a civilian craft. he looks up at hear the Warrant Officer walk in to the flight deck and howler up at him. he catches the combat jump suit. "Thank you sir. But I didn't get you anything." Vor'en smiles and looks the armor over. It was not what he had been trained to use and it was not close to his Storm Trooper armor he had on the his ship but it would do. "Oh the Major said something but a promotion for you or something to that effect. I guess I am going to have to start calling you sir before much longer. And Feldon is letting Awne and Woro tag along with us. There good so I not to worried about them." he continues his repairs on the comm dish.

**Hangar Bay 7: 1705**
The droid bows to the corporal's statement.
M3P0C: "Sorry for any inconvenience. It is protocol for us to check on every ship in the hangar bay. It seems you're having trouble with your sensors?"
**TIME ADVANCEMENT: 2 hours**
Nevertheless, Vor'en works on the ship for two hours after receiving a call from Major Kiernan. It seems the Warrant Officer was having a promotion ceremony in the hangar bay. 1st, 2nd, and weapons platoon got into formation in between the ships of the hangar bay and Major Kiernan formally promoted Warrant Officer Natirash to a 2nd Lieutenant. The whole company gave an ovation to the newly promoted officer and a resounding oohrah that made your hair stand on end with motivation. The major briefed the unit that something was going down in the unit and everyone was ordered not to talk about any events they witness on the ship to anybody. Once the unit was dismissed, the 90 or so marines stood around in the hangar bay mingling. The Lieutenant might be feeling a little empowered at his new rank and command of Vor'en's 2nd platoon. The major came up and gave the LT a warm handshake.
Major Kiernan: "Congratulations. I'm sure you will make a fine infantry officer."

<strong>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POST: EVERYONE READ!!! TIME ADVANCEMENT ONE WEEK AND TWO DAYS!
</strong>
The major briefs the lieutenant entirely on the situation with Gor 'Ak and how they would be traveling to the Rosche asteroid cluster to gather information on Gor's AI and destroy it. He would be taking Red Team with him because they are the only one's with clearance to act on Vjun intelligence. After about one day of preparation, Red Team travels to the Rosche asteroids to meet with the Verpines and infiltrate their way to Gor's contact.
Before this happens, an intelligence team assembles to act on Gor's alleged past ties with the SpyNet. They wanted to confirm what was going on as Gor seemed to be changing stories and that he was a former Spy. The intel team could not turn a blind eye to see why he would maliciously hack the comm equipment to send out sensitive intelligence. They take Gor's message, while keeping any coding, and erase all the Vjun-sensitive information. The group then cleverly sends out a phony message to Gor's contact with a tracer code in it. Red Team departs once they confirm that "Gor's" message arrives at its intended source.
Red Team has an uneventful trip to the Rosche asteroids via hyperspace. Once they arrive, they meet the technologically inclined Verpine and quickly make their way to a hospital where the contact is. They discover Gor's computer and notice the Verpine personnel don't even really know much about the computer. They confiscate the entire computer and notify the Verpine personnel that they have the right to take it for bearing military intelligence. The Verpine hospital staff gladly hand it over.
The group arrives back at the Dark Stallion about one week and two days later. The intelligence team had made a crucial discovery. The phony message with the tracer code had worked. Gor's intended destination for the information would pass through a series of routes. Ultimately, it would arrive to a HoloNet gateway that was linked directly at the SpyNet. The phony message had done its job at finding out its true destination.
It was time for someone to address Gor to the true intentions of the message. It was obvious Gor had betrayed everyone on Vjun to send the information to the SpyNet. Everyone who had shed their blood had now been scoffed upon for the essence of espionage.

**TIME ADVANCEMENT: 3 DAYS**
At the third day of learning Gor's treason and espionage; Admiral Ordani and Major Kiernan are at a difficult decision. The bothan had proved his loyalty against the Republic by trying to transmit information of a superweapon that would pose a tremendous threat to the galaxy if not controlled. They ultimately had to determine the bothan's fate under urgent conditions.
So the Admiral used her power to make an executive decision.... Even though the Jedi fought this conclusion. It was really the safest way, albeit the not most morally sound.
**TRAINING ROOM: 1600**
Two armed marines from 1st platoon escorted the bothan to the back of the black-surfaced training room. The room was empty and used for hologram training. They placed his back to the wall with his hands and ankles restrained. The two marines made sure he couldn't move much and then they rejoined the other troops on the firing line. The firing line was a group of about 12 men, who were fifteen feet away from the bothan. They were all armed with CDEF carbines.
There was a small crowd of observers to witness the event, and all of Red Team was here. The Jedi were present to meditate of the passing of life to the Force. The marines were here to take accountability of the action. Major Kiernan looked over to the bothan and back to Lieutenant Natirash.
Major Kiernan: "Gor Ak! You have been sentenced with high treason and espionage. The punishment is death by firing squad! You're loyalty is against the good will of the Republic and you are too dangerous to be kept alive with the knowledge you possess! Lieutenant Natirash, carry out the sentence!"
There was a team from the band here, and they were playing the drums to signify the tension of the event.

Awne stood beside her master, the Ewok at her side. She held no reaction to the events before her, in her mind he had betrayed them all and sent the information that had cost her cub and another member of the packs lives, as well as her old arm and their friend and their other master Jedi.
It was low, she didn't know spies but she would think even they thought it to be low.
The farghul glances down to the Ewok mumbling softly "Don't look Kaz...you don't need to watch this.." her arm was wrapped around his shoulders as she wanted to give him comfort in this; not even her tail was flicking in her rigid posture.

The small Ewok struggled to look and managed to get an eye out into the open while saying softly "Kaz'jee want make sure that thing is taken care of...need to see for himself. Kaz'jee may be small but does not mean he is a youngling." He then looks up to Awne with a nod "I want to see this..."

"Well, thanks for the time guys, it was fun. Sarge, keep the team together and well. Woro, you go ahead and make Lorhas proud. You´ll be the next in the ranks of Jedi Masters, I know it"
He then looked at Naitrash.
"That´s the beauty of the military isn´t it? You can always blame someone else, and if that don´t work, blame it on protocol"
He shook his eyes at the sight of the blindfold.

"Masterr..." she says softly "Arre you alrright?" she asks, she knew that if she put her feeling aside as she was supposed to in all situations to be a Jedi she would have trouble with this taking of a life but at the moment..well...this whole time really, she'd had trouble with it.

**TRAINING ROOM: 1605**
The disciplined marines do not hesitate at all as a stream of blaster fire permeates the air with violence of action. The bolts rip through the bothan's chest and bloody dust flies out everywhere. One bolt even struck the bothan on his face, ripping the side of it off to expose his skull. In mere seconds, the bothan was laying flat on his face....dead.
The major went over to the fallen bothan to make sure he was dead.
Major Kiernan: "Sentence....completed. Marines! Get his body out of the airlock. Hmm, it seems he urinated on himself in fear. Poor bastard."
Feldon was not watching the events with ease. He seemed to revolted about the whole thing but somewhat understanding. But suddenly, a curious thing was happening among the ranks of Red Team.

Kaz'jee watches as the bolts fire from the squad with eyes widened, not with intrigue or wonder...but in pure shock.

The ewok had watched the demise of Gor 'Ak bravely. The shock that occurred in him was keen and brilliant. He had witnessed the passing of life. To the Jedi, this was becoming one with the Force. Nearly moments after the bothan had died, the ewok felt like his eyes had just opened to the galaxy again. As if he had been reborn. The little ewok had awakened. It reminded him of stepping out of his large tree village on the forest moon of Endor. It was like stepping into the open to see the lush forest canopy and flourishing life.
Like a bright buoy in the web of the Force, the one closest to the little creature felt his presence shine immensely. Perhaps it was the shock of a dying creature that triggered this?
Whatever the case...Kaz 'Jee had the power of the Force.
One might think this is why he was being studied on Vjun. The personnel in the Falsoor facility did have great interest in Force-sensitive beings. However, it was unlikely that Kaz 'Jee himself was aware of his potential.

She blinks at the Ewok then to her master and back "Kaz you..." She looks to her master, moving her arm to clasp at his arm "Masterr I can feel Kaz in the forrce he just....appearred.."

Woroken was disgusted by the scene that played out in front of him. More than any time since the battle on the planet, he wished Lorhas was there. He knew Lorhas would have come up with some way to stop the scene that had just played out. An eye for an eye type of retribution was not what Lorhas would have wanted. With his untapped Force potential, Gor could have been useful with just a little bit of molding, but now that would not happen.
The wookiee looked away from the scene as it transpired. He had seen death many times, and quite frankly was growing tired of it. Without a word to the others, he retired to his quarters after the incident.

Feldon and Lues looked at Awne in bewilderment. It was evident they had noticed the potential in Kaz 'Jee as well. Woroken senses were not as keen. Their attention couldn't help but turn to the marines who were carrying out Gor's body. They place him into a body bag and take a walk to the nearest airlock. Within moments, the body is propelled into the vacuum of space.
After the body is disposed, Major Kiernan approaches the Lieutenant.
Major Kiernan: "Lieutenant, I need you to get the entire Vjun shore party together and inform them we're having a delayed debrief about the events on Vjun in one hour. We got the initial statements now we have to do the closing remarks. Get everyone to bring caf with them because this will be long. The Admiral is going to want to see this.

Kaz'jee watches the body go sailing out into the deep cold reaches of space but gives a salute that he had seen being used before between some of his friends here...Even though he might not have agreed with Gor, he still would never have wished death on him. Yet this was how proceedings took place with those that were considered traitors...and he was not about to question the authority of a law that wasnt his own...not yet at this moment. But now enough blood had been spilled and he hoped he would not see more of it.
Kaz'jee looks now with a start to Awne and tilts his head "What force?" He then looks now to Lues and tilts his head the other way "This bad or good..." The Ewok was very confused at this point, but would wait for an answer.

Meanwhile, the white haired Jedi bent over to Kaz 'Jee.
Lues: "Well my little friend, you've witnessed us using it quite often. The Force is, simply put...everything. It's everything you know. It is everything you can see, touch, and feel in the very essence of your spirit. It is reality that we all know. It is life.

Vor'en stayed long enuf for the judgement to be handed down for Gor' ak. He did care much for what had transpired, Gor had betrayed them all and placed the lives of everyone on the ship in jeopardy. To execute him for his actions was a waste. He could have been turned around and put to use on some project, but he was not in charge here and didn't want to be. He busied him with cleaning his weapons and and readying his gear for a mission and there was the maintenance on the Starshade, he still need to get the senors working again. Maybe he could pay one of the techs in the hanger bay to repair them. He filed reports and did what training he could get in while on down time. If they didn't get a mission soon he would put in a request to aid one of the other platoons or maybe he would take some of the new Marines that came in and help them with they needed.

The major was standing at the end of the table, awaiting everyone to take their seats.
Major Kiernan: "Good evening everyone. How are things? I'm sorry to call you all in late but this has been put off long enough. Feel free to take some caf if you would like. Basically, we're going to get one final verbal account on the events of Vjun. So if you don't mind, please take your seats."

As such, the caf had been loaded with sugar and cream to try and make it some type of tolerable to her palate.

He hated these things, he hated what had happened in the last few weeks. There was nothing he could do to stop it from snowballing and that was a shame. He looks over at Awne and smiles. He had not spent a lot of time with her as he should have. He had been kept busy with everything that was going on.

**Briefing Area: Time 1806**
The major waits for everyone to get in their seats and then begins speaking.
Major Kiernan: "Alright, moving right into it. We're going to do a full debrief on what actually happened on Vjun. Firstly, let's discuss your mission objectives. Your mission objectives were as follows : 1. You were to search out and discover the condition of Jedi Knight, Jes Mur Eva. If she was in a helpless condition and appeared to need help, you were to assist. You were to rescue her if she was held captive anywhere. You were to assist to get her out of danger, if any. But you were to rescue her only if she so desired.
2. You were supposed to conduct a reconnaissance patrol on the surface of Vjun to determine any Falsoor presence. You were also to determine if there was any other force that could be a threat to galactic security or the Republic. If Falsoor was discovered, you were to find out what they are doing there and why.
Secondary objective: Your secondary objective was to gather any information of Falsoor's corruption. You were to take evidence of Falsoor personnel handling illegal weaponry. Also, you were supposed to take evidence of any other corrupted item,data, or person.

"Sir. We accomplished all but the rescue of Jedi Mur Ev. We found that the Falsoor factory was home to genetic experiment on Jedi to create a super force user. As far as he planet went it was in chaos from what was going on with the Sithlord Strife. The data we brought back should have everything we found."

Woroken sat quietly in his chair. At the current time, he was not a huge fan of the military. He had filed his report as requested, and was not completely happy about being required to sit through another meeting about the mission, the gathered information, and the happenings on the planet. Perhaps this meeting would have been a better idea before the military decided to execute one of the group members.
He looked around the room, noticed that Vor seemed to be in even worse shape than normal. He was looking extremely haggard. Woro realized he hadn't had much of a chance to talk to him about Lorhas, other than their brief moment in the cockpit after the incident. He would make a point to try and get a translator and talk to him soon...knowing him, he had no doubt that Vor was blaming himslef for Lorhas's death.

Kaz'jee continues to sip the drink before feeling...odd. His digits quickly started drumming against his chair and he tried to still himself by gripping his seat tightly, only to find that he couldnt keep his legs from swinging in and out. At the Major's orders to tell about action taken on the planet he immediately looks up and says "Kaz'jee was rescued by...by Big Fuzzy and Awne, and given glow-stick thing...and, and Kaz'jee was tortured and found by Big Fuzzy and Awne and-" He immediately cuts himself off as he realised that speaking out of turn would most likely be frowned upon. Poor little Ewok...it was his first experience with Caffeine.

"Alright, Sev, Stay with the fighter." Kayli Sunstalker told her droid, R7-B7, as she climbed out of the E-wing fighter. The droid beeped its acknowledge him. The old fighter was one of the first the Republic had received, and it had been with Kayli since her first sortie in the Battle of Mon Calmarri. But despite its age, the E-wing was in excellent shape, Just like its Pilot, who had streaks of gray in her hair.
"Alright, Have at it." She said to the deck crew as she stepped way from the fighter, taking off the helmet to the marine armor she wore instead of the standard issue flight suit. The helmet she clipped to her belt. "Where can I find Major Kiernan?"
"He's in the briefing room." the Dock officer told her, and pointed the woman in the right direction. Kayli nods her thanks, and makes her way to the briefing room. Part of her would have loved a moment to head to the refresher and enjoy a long shower after the long uneventful trip to the Frigate. She knocked on the door, and entered without waiting for a response.
"Sorry to interrupt Major Kiernan, but my orders were to report right away. Warrant Officer Kayli Sunstalker reporting."

Major Kiernan: "These will be the people you are working with. You even have Jedi on your side. I heard you were one of the best pilots out there. You've been attached to us because we've just uncovered something incredible. This will require some of the best hands and someone with a low profile. It just so happens you fit the bill.

Awne glances to Vor'en as he speaks with the major, she had every intention of staying quiet as this wasn't her real feel for things...not like it ever had been even as a bounty hunter.
At the sudden voice from her side she glances over with a raised brow at the movements of hyperness, A chuckle escapes the Farghuls lips behind the rim of her cup, her tail flicking down at her ankles. Ah the Ewok's first taste of caffeine it seemed.
Glancing back to the Major she leans back into her chair, claws faintly trailing over her mug in an amused yet bored fashion. That is of course until...
"Sorry to interrupt Major Kiernan, but my orders were to report right away. Warrant Officer Kayli Sunstalker reporting."
A growl comes to the Farghuls lips, eyes narrowing as her lips curl back in a silent hiss her fur puffing up faintly as her ears fold back. There was only a few reasons that someone interrupted a meeting in a debrief, none of which she liked
"These will be the people you are working with."
This time a growl did escape, soft but still there, fur puffing up more as her tail thrashed beside her, Red Team knew, the older members at least, that the Farghul was not good with other females when it came to her pack.

Vor'en thinks back to when they first arrived on the hell hole of a planet.
If he knew then what he knew now he would have never set foot on it.
He didn't let the new Warrant Officer that arrived distract him that much. He stands and salutes her then goes back to what he was doing.
"Should I continue sir? The Warrant Officer may not be cleared to hear this information." Vor'en found it weird that he was suddenly worried about such things. At any rate he continues gathering his thoughts. He looks over at Awne when he hears a slight complaint coming from her. He gives her the not now look that should tell her everything would be fine.

Looking at the Warrant Officer. "I am Corporal Vor'en ma'am. I am lead on the ground for Red Team." He waits to let everyone introduce themselves then continues.
Looking over at the Major. "I understand that what we found should shut Falsoor down for good and that it cost me part of my team to get it. I also understand that in the wrong hands this could be very bad for everyone." Going back to the holovid on the table. "When we landed on planet we geared up and headed out. We headed to a settlement, we had to land outside of there defensive umbrella to keep from getting shot down. The LT. flew the Starshade while the rest of use entered on foot. We ran into moderate resistance but where able to get by them. Apon entering the settlement we found it to be almost destroyed. There where blaster marks and no signs of life any where in the area.

She continues to watch the woman but with the introductions she couldn't simply stay quiet, "Awne Torra, Jedi Apprrentice." she said simply, right to the point and she made sure the other woman would know that it would take time if not a miracle to get into her good graces, after all...it was her pack the human was being told to join.

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-01-12 07:01:41)

The major waits for introductions to the new fighter pilot to conclude and continues on with the debrief. Red Team then begins the discussion about how their rescue and reconnaissance mission went on Vjun. This was all very new to Kayli, and apparently this shore party had the mission to rescue a Jedi. They also had a mission to investigate Falsoor, a research organization who apparently was illegally carrying military grade equipment. Before the Republic investigation, Falsoor had gained galaxy-wide support and even had representation on the Senate. They had restored many planets that had been affected in the Galactic Civil War. The organization did this by bio-research and cloning of ecology to restore life. Falsoor was loved by many people throughout the galaxy.
Apparently to Kayli, the group had encountered much of Falsoor's presence on the barren world of Vjun while attempting to rescue a Jedi Knight.
The mission had all started when the group landed on Vjun via freighter. They walked in by foot through the mountains to arrive at a Falsoor colony. The colony had apparently been overrun by attack droids and some of the refugees had even joined the Republic shore party. The reason of the attack was unknown and the affiliation of the droids were also unknown.
The group also suffered a sniper attack by an assault droid that had claimed the lives of some of Corporal Vor'en's men, including Xander. Once they were finished investigating at the colony, the group proceeded through more mountainous terrain. They encountered mindless colonists who attacked with limited motor skills. Their behavior was rabid and unexplained but the shore party was able to successfully escape the attack.
They arrived at a Falsoor refugee camp where innocent bystanders had been injured or killed from the colony attack. The shore party exchanged information and the refugee leader told the group that he encountered a strange sensor dish relay that may be a lead to their investigation.
The group traveled to the relay dish and discovered a underground facility that claimed to be a mining guild. The shore party was forced to defend themselves. They discovered military grade equipment in the complex and also a mainframe that seemed to have loose affiliation with Falsoor.
The group had found astounding news on the mainframe. The complex was apparently being used for cloning research and construction of Force warriors who could be mass produced. Major Kiernan grimly informed Kayli that she needed to see a certain holovid of their discoveries.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

While the group is viewing the holovid, Gor notices that the monitor shows the date of the recording goes back to 16 ABY. These events had happened years ago. The holovid goes to the next segment...
The woman who appeared to be Vesslyn was strapped into the experimental panel. A number of medical containers hooked to tubes were surrounding her. Various other medical equipment resided near the woman and it showed these machines linked to the vulnerable woman.
It was a horrific scene of medicine being used for the wrong reasons. A younger version of the deceased man you recently found can be seen strolling next to the experimentation board. The man spoke into the holovid.
Dr. Haliford: "The subject has been drained of a tremendous amount of blood. We've managed to utilize the blood in isolating this woman's midi-chlorian cells. We have all the usable amount of midi-chlorian samples that we'll need. The first step of the plan has went perfectly."
The doctor roams around and the holovid tracks him to another half of the laboratory where you see various lab containers, they seemed to be holding blood. The blood didn't look normal, it looked thinner. The liquid also seemed to be illuminated.
Dr. Haliford: "Although these midi-chlorian cells are not completely prepared to be introduced to a new host, they will be soon after we cultivate them with various amounts of treatment. After the treatment is concluded and the midi-chlorians are ready to be infused, we'll need a similar test subject to those we have extracted the cells from. We'll need a host that is biologically related to you, Vesslyn. This new host, if my calculations are correct, will have its Force potential tripled by the infusion of more midi-chlorians. In theory, this Infusion technique can grant the power of the Force to any individual or bolster the existing ability already."
The scientist orders the other droids and humans from the laboratory. He walks over to Vesslyn and caresses her cheek. The woman spits in his face with what seems to be her last bit of energy.
Dr. Haliford: "The new host I need will come from you Miss Eva... Now, what I'm about to do to you is in the interest of science. However, I won't hold it against you if you take any pleasure in this...."
The man laughs as he crawls on top of the restrained woman.
Dr. Haliford: "I know I will....hahahaha!"
The group watches in sheer horror as the scientist proceeds to rape the woman in the video known as Vesslyn Mur Eva. It was shocking what this bizarre experimentation video had entailed...what crimes was Falsoor responsible for?

</details>

Once the holovid is concluded, the debrief closes off.
The shore party had encountered what they believed to be a Sith Lord at the end. The Sith Lord was allegedly behind the creation of the mass-produced Force warriors and was suspected to be behind Falsoor's dark motives. They found their Jedi Knight friend restrained by the Sith Lord and were unable to rescue her. Jedi Master Kel-Yun Lorhas gave his life so the shore party could escape the self-destructing facility.
The group was unable to keep data cores from the mainframe of the facility but they were able to get holographed evidence of the weapons and Force-warrior information.
At this phase of the mission, the only lead seems to be towards Thule. This is where an order was issued to the "mining personnel" to regroup from the self-destructing facility. The Jedi are unable to track their Jedi Knight friend via their feelings. The Republic officials are also working hard to bring Falsoor to termination. They may need more evidence to bring the popular organization down.
As of now, all evidence points toward Thule if the group is to continue pursuing Falsoor and the Sith Lord. **Everyone in the room is ordered to not spread information about the mission and their discoveries. No one is authorized to leave the ship. The mass produced Force-warrior information could very well threaten galactic security if it is uncontrolled. For this reason, this is why Gor &#39;Ak was terminated. He was too dangerous to be kept alive, by the Republic&#39;s judgment.** 
The discussion ends after about one hour. The major looks up and addresses the hearing.
Major Kiernan: "Ok, you know what we'll be working towards. Expect a mission to Thule soon. This is pending coordination with the chain of command, intelligence analysts, and the Jedi Praxeum. Do we have any questions at this time? Does anyone have a dispute with our current lead? Officer Sunstalker, you must have something?"

Without looking, he knew what the sound was coming from his right. Awne wasn't pleased about another female being introduced as a member to her "pack." He didn't even attempt to calm her, as he knew Kaz could do the job, and Awne would warm to the newcomer...eventually. After she proved herself.

He took a deep breath and opened the door before walking in "Sargent Detonite reporting for duty. Corporal Vor'en, Lieutenant Natirash, sorry I'm late but the docs thought I needed some more rest before going back into action. So it took a while but I proved that I was fit for duty." He saluted the officers in the room as he spoke and stood as straight as he could. He waited for a second before lowering his arm and finding a empty space on the wall. As walked over he took a look around the room and noticed all the faces and made a mental not to get all their names.
Eriks zipped up his vest the rest of the was as he leaned against the wall, lacking his shirt he figured it would be inappropriate to leave it open.

Apparently, they had made contact with the Praxeum back on Yavin 4. They were talking to the Knight, Wurth Skidder. The blonde human with the stubbled face turned to face the apprentices who walked into the room. There was also an image of the silver haired Tionne Solusar.

**Briefing room**
Wurth Skidder paced around in his holographic imagery setting. The Jedi seemed to bypass the negative light of the situation.
Wurth Skidder: "We read the reports of the actions on Vjun. The point is, you both handled the situation well. We believe that the Republic hesitated in their actions to withdrawal from the powerful Sith. This is understandable, because of the fact they have likely never encountered one. Most of us haven't. But you two, performed exceptionally well. You followed Master Lorhas' orders and in turned saved more lives. Both of you were also able to recover sensitive discoveries. An emergence of a Sith Lord and evidence of a organization's wrongdoing. Also, a suspected new clone army with incredible potential. You stood in the face of the Dark Side and prevailed. Your service to the Force is honorable."
The silver-haired woman in Jedi robes stood and made a powerful statement.
Tionne Solusar: "You've passed two phases of the trials of Knighthood. The trials of skill and flesh have been mastered by you both. Now comes the final step. The trial of spirit."
The two Jedi exchanged glances and Wurth nodded at Tionne.
Tionne Solusar: "Knight Feldon reports that you've discovered two Force beings amongst you. We believe this is a testament to your destinies. One of them have passed to the Force and one yet remains. We believe this one ewok has been chosen. And we choose to usher in this wonderful occasion with ceremony. As it stands, you will both be responsible for identifying young Kaz 'Jee for training. You are to ask him two questions of your choosing and then question him of what virtue he considers most important. With these three questions, you will pass to us whether or not you feel Kaz is ready for Jedi training. The one padawan with the correct answer shall become a Jedi Knight and train young Kaz' Jee the ways of the Force. The one who fails shall remain a padawan and continue on as a learner. You are to carry out your trial as soon as possible. Is that understood apprentices?"
Indeed, being addressed by the beautiful and wise Tionne was a privilege in itself. She was considered by many to be the teacher of the Jedi order. The two padawans had been given a great honor and a monumental task.

Major Kiernan: "Good afternoon Lieutenant. We've got a new designation for your specialized Falsoor investigation team. I've heard Vor'en calling these guys Red Team all the time, so that's what will call you. I need you to gather Red Team together and have them at the aft briefing room by 1400. The intel gurus have a meeting for us. After that, we move. The mission to Thule has been organized. We've been working at this around the clock, so make sure you do this by the numbers.

Awne's eyes widden as she glances to her friend then back to the holonet; they had passed two tests already but this third...a test of their own intuition and spirit then?
She frowns slightly, But only one of them would continue on to be a Jedi Knight if they questioned correctly and the other would have to take the tests all over again when they were allowed.
She looks back to the wookiee, she knew Woro would have the better questions, he had done all he could to follow the teaches to the best of his ability and beyond, and she still have trouble with mastering keeping emotions in check. Kaz would be better with him if it came to it.
She turns her attention to the holonet again "We underrstand masterrs, we will do ourr best to ensurre we ask rright to betterr assess Kaz'jee."

Tionne: "But remember this learners. We appreciate the eight years of service you've given to the Jedi Order to this point.

A few hours of bunk time, a change of clothing, and some quality time in the refresher. Sometimes it was the simple things that let a veteran know things were right in the galaxy. Kayli didn't let the details of the briefing bother her, One simply couldn't dwell on things like that without permanently damaging ones mental health.
Eventually the fighter pilot found her way back down to the Hanger. Kayli could only shake her head, as Sev was polishing the E-wing fighter with a cloth, and cooing happily to herself. It was common for the R7 series to develop a "Mother Hen" mentality when it comes to "Their" fighter, but Sev seemed to take it to extreme. But if the Droid seemed happy then she knew the fighter was being well taken care off.
Finally the woman ends up in the information processing center, She finds an empty terminal, and begins doing some information searches. First, was on the Thule system, as that was they're next destination by all appearances. The other was to look over the raw data gathered by the team on Vjun herself.

**Corridor: Time 1240**
Kayli walks outside into the hallways where various Navy personnel were walking about. She accessed a computer and began seeking information through the HoloNet.
She was able to learn that Thule was located in the Outer Rim Territories. It had a population of 790 million and they were mostly human. The primary government was military hierarchies. It's terrain primarily consisted of hills and rocky terrain. Tremendous lightning was common here. A day was 38 hours. This place also had served as a battleground for Jedi/Sith throughout the years.
Further research into the computer system brings up nothing about the team's exploits on Vjun. It was likely this information was very sensitive and likely should be taken up with the shore party themselves.

Kayli makes note of the information of the Thule system, even transferring it onto a datacard. She'd review it in more detail on the flight. She then returns to he hanger.
"Sev, Make sure you check the Surge diffusers. Apparently the Thule system has frequent electrical storms." Kayli told her droid, before walking over to the service tech nearby.
"What sort of E-wing parts do you have in inventory?" She asked, politely. Wanting to make sure her ship was going to be properly cared for.

The second man was slightly shorter had spiked green hair. "So boss what's the word?" the taller one asked. Eriks smile "Sorry Matsun I can't talk about it right now." he said patting him on the shoulder. Vlad sighed and rolled his eyes "You missed another briefing...didn't you." Eriks sighed and dropped his shoulders "Hey it wasn't my fault this time. The doctor kept longer than they needed to."
"And who was the one who shot the guy with the unstable condensed tibanna gas in his backpack?" Matsun asked
"Hey how was I supposed to know?"
"And because *you* shot him it cause a chain reaction which cause a large explosion." Vlad said it a slightly annoyed tone
"Which cause the heated pressure pipe to fracture." Matsun added
"And that caused the super heated steam to spray on your armor and melt it." Vlad said in a slightly cold tone
"Which cause the severe burns that caused you to miss the briefing." Matsun smiled
"So it is yo---" Eriks held up his hand cutting off Vlad before he could finish "Alright! Alright!..I get it." he barked "You know you guys really like to give you're CO a hard time."

Bothan tech: "Well ma'am...depends on what you're looking for. A ship that size would be hard to get anything put on it. But, we can do anything from shields to weapon upgrades. Perhaps some modifications to your sensors to give you a better heads-up? Or maybe you need a jamming suite to cut someone's communications off?"

"And its only in as good a shape as it is because of techs such as yourself. Check the serial number, Its the Eighth E-wing accepted into republic service." She said, walking over to the starfighter, then she giggled to herself. "I wonder how long it'll be before its taken way from me for the Republic Stardrive Museum on Courasant?

He felt new still, and what with him being awakened to the force he felt even moreso like this. What would happen to him now? "Kaz'jee...be easy..." He told himself out loud. Even with all the new friends he had, especially Awne and Woro, he felt like something was still missing...other than his home.

All of Aymaric's time on the ship had been spent avoiding everyone he knew who had been on Vijun. He was questioning his state of mind and his next course of action. Staying on Vijun to clean up what was left of the research facility and report to Falsoor on what had happened, would have been the right thing to do. Sending a message to his dead girlfriends family would have been the right thing to do. But he didn't want to deal with it, any of it. The pain and grief he felt for all the people he knew that were now dead, was gnawing at him constantly. Every waking moment was shadowed by memories of all that had happened in the last week spent on that hell hole of a planet. He couldn't be anywhere near the mess hall, the smell of cooked meat always seemed to smell like burnt flesh. Alcohol was his only way to chase the waking nightmares and ghosts away, but that would only put him in a deep sleep that prolonged his most vivid treks through a horrifying past.
Using his medical experience and annoying attitude, he found salvation in the med bay. The original intent of visiting the med bay had been to try and get his mind off his issues by helping out and getting back to what he knew best. This backfired though when the first patient to come into the bay was bleeding profusely from a wound on her face. The bloody face brought Aymaric a cargo hold worth of memories he had hoped he'd forgotten. His buckling knees and nauseated dizziness caused the surprised man to stumble into a new crate of medical supplies loaded with pain meds and sedatives. Avoiding a catastophic spill, he stared at the contents of the crate for sometime, ignoring the drama unfolding around him. Aymaric went unnoticed for the next several minutes as the medical crew worked together as a seasoned team, probably preferring he just stayed out of the way. This distraction and Aymaric's desperation for a solution to his demons, provided an opportunity that Aymaric took full advantage of.
Poketing a few vials of pain killers and placing a couple boxes of sedatives in aplace that could be considered an accident if found, he starts to help the medical staff finish there treatment of the lady with the wound, not caring about the blood anymore. His excitment over his acquisitions gave him a new hope that the darkness folowing him could be dulled.

The intelligence officer folds her arms behind her torso and begins speaking aloud.
Lt. Zhell: "First of all, I'd like to thank you for your efforts on Vjun. We heard you went through a lot to bring us this information and we greatly appreciate it. It's helped us a lot and shown us the resolve of both the Jedi order and our military. As it turns out, Jedi Master Lorhas' suspicions were correct. The research company, Falsoor, is up to no good. At first, we were reluctant to take official action towards this company, but to our surprise it was the right thing to do."
The gray-haired woman gestures toward the HoloNet projection system and a documentary begins to play. It shows Falsoor workers helping to rebuild ecosystems and cities throughout different planets. The vid also displays employees assisting the hungry and poor. It seemed various species from all different places were benefiting from their good will.
Lt. Zhell: "As some of you may know, Falsoor research has dedicated tremendous resources to assist planets in rebuilding that have suffered great losses after war. They took on a role of cleanup that many factions tended to neglect. The group has done much in restoring life and building places up better than they were before. They assisted such places as Manaan by restoring an entire ocean full of aquatic life. The group helped restore Onderon after an Imperial battle by restoring ecology and life. They even had a hand in abolishing slavery on Tatooine. A truly noble organization...or so we thought. Their work was so recognized that they even earned a place in the Republic Senate. They got there out of sheer demand and reputation. And now due to recent events, we've uncovered that this is all a front to serve their own selfish needs. It seems certain individuals in Falsoor have been using the resources gathered to accomplish their own wishes. The goals of these individuals is not entirely clear. But our mission has just become to get to the bottom of these unjust actions. We need to find out what they are up to and what they plan to do. And I'm going to tell you that incriminating this beloved organization will take a lot of work. What you guys have done up to this point has kick started us in the right direction."

He stands in his chair, after nuzzling against the Farghul and says in an outspoken voice "Kaz'jee wishes to know when Kaz'jee get voice box thing...and also wants to know what happen now with him and force thing." He murrs in thought for a few moments before starting back up "Also want to know where Kardoon is...and...and maybe a new weapon for Kaz'jee...to replace this one?" He holds out a vibrodagger and blinks sheepishly "Kaz'jee would like shooter thing...possibly?" Even though the room had a large amount of people, this was not the time to be shy.

**Aft Briefing Room (1445)**
The lieutenant scanned the room quickly and made an announcement.
Lt. Zhell: "If there is no questions, I'll turn this over to Ensign Barklen."
A younger human Naval officer stood from a bench and walked into the center of the briefing area.
Ensign Barklen: "Afternoon everyone. Let's go over why you went to Vjun and the discoveries you made from Falsoor's equipment. Before we start...I have a question for the Jedi. Was it ever determined why Jes Mur Eva went down to Vjun? Was she on Jedi orders?"
The hologram of Wurth reacted to the question.
Wurth Skidder: "No. Whatever reason she was there was her own. We did not give her any reason to be there."
As this was being said, Woroken and Awne could feel that Lues felt particularly uneasy at that question.
Ensign Barklen: "I see. Well, moving on. The initial reason to take action against Falsoor was suspicion of illegal activity and possession of military grade weapons without licensing. Corporal Vor'en's team was able to gather sufficient evidence of military arms in the underground facility. However, the weapons are difficult to trace them actually belonging to Falsoor. There are no marks that make them actually appear to have belonged to them either. The fact that you got copies of data files from a Falsoor computer isn't enough to incriminate them officially. The data copies cannot be ran via programs so any of the information you all gathered cannot be used as official evidence. The reason being is because the files can be altered as copies to incriminate Falsoor. We needed a local program to link the files and weaponry. All you've given us is copies of evidence that cannot be used completely. In short, this weapon evidence isn't enough to link them to Falsoor. We know someone possessed military grade weaponry, we just cannot prove who. However, what you've given us is enough to conduct follow-up investigations toward Falsoor. You've created a stepping stone to bringing this group to justice."
Judging by what the officer said, the copies and holopics of the evidence weren't fully incriminating as it was hard to prove them having relation to Falsoor. The memory cores probably would of done the job better but they were with Kardoon, wherever he was.

Vor'en looks up from his data pad. "So what you are saying is that what we gathered is damning but will not hold up in court. So now we have to make a official investigation into there dealing? They are going to destroy any hard copies they have the intent we show up. Plus Strife is not going to let any thing connect him to what happened on V'jun." The things that happened on the planet still run though his mind. So many things went wrong. "What if we where able to locate the data cores we found on V'jun? Would those help us any at all?"

The ensign quickly responds to the Corporal in a cool tone.
Ensign Barklen: "What you've gathered is enough for us to act, but not for record. If we're discovered acting against Falsoor we could face tremendous opposition. They hold a seat in the Senate and this would be similar to the Trade Federation blockade of Naboo pre-Clone Wars. We needed evidence that can be irrefutably connected to Falsoor. Copies of data files are good but those are easily manipulated, an official hearing would obviously known this. Falsoor would use that in their defense. But what's this about data cores?"

"We where able to get the cores out but the ship they where on as far as we knew did not make it of V'jun. We waited in orbit as long as we could with the damage that was done to the Starshade." Vor'en looks around at the others. " If we could locate that ship we would have the cores that we need. At last report he was picking up civilians that he had agreed to get off planet." Vor'en realizes that he had left this out of the report cause ass far as he knew Kardoon never left the planet.

Woro watched yet another meeting transpire with distraction. The military was taking long moments to blame each other individually for any mishap. They all seemed to be interested in simply covering their own hind quarters, it appeared to Woro.
As he was bored, he began paying attention to Kaz'jee and watching him fairly intently. It was clear he was growing before everyone's eyes. A couple weeks ago, Kaz would have been scared of his own shadow, but now he was speaking up in a large meeting of "important" people. Whether it was being removed from his awful capture and arrangements, or the Force, Kaz was definitely becoming more comfortable with himself.

That was all fine and dandy but what about his request for a new weapon or a commlink? The humble Ewok sighs and sits down now, trying his best to listen in on the conversation but finds it incredibly boring as it progressed. He mumbles to himself "Kaz'jee wants a talky box thing...and new weapon...Kaz'jee will just have to go -find- one then on his own..." He looks up to Worro and smiles with his eyes for a brief second before looking at the table. If boredom was a drill...there would surely be a hole in the table and the floor from where the Ewok was looking.

And now that bantha pudoo had gotten Vor into trouble for a simple mistake, a growl escapes her as she makes note of the face for reference for later.
Shaking her head she shifts in her seat to move her tail allowing her to flick it slowly, she looks down to the Ewok as he catches her attention, still angery at the human she calms herself a little "I'll take you laterr to get you both alrright?"

After everyone seemed to have collected themselves from the stint with Vor'en, the ensign replies to the lieutenant.
Ensign Barklen: "Well, all of you who traveled together are now assembled as Red Team for this operation against Falsoor. They have channeled their funds to what we believe to be a Sith Lord. This Sith Lord has used ancient Sith alchemy, cloning research, force infusion, and your friend Mur Eva to generate an army of Force-able warriors. These warriors are called reavers. They have been mass produced into an unknown amount. Some of the schematics are enclosed in the data you all gathered. We need you to follow up on the lead to Thule. It was said that at Thule the Falsoor personnel was going to regroup from the self-destructed Vjun complex. When you go to Thule, you might very well encounter a group of reavers. Or its possible you might face as something as light as security droids."
Ensign Barklen: "Anyways, I'll send a detailed file about the Falsoor operation to your datapads if you request it. I suggest you look at it."
While he's speaking, a zygerrian officer stands to address the group.
Commander Meek: "I understand that some of you are not officially related to the Republic. I would ask us that you please join us. Because due to the threat of galactic security, we are bound to see this to its end. None of us must talk about what has transpired. The information about the Reaver army is devastating if it's not controlled. I'd ask all of you who are not in Republic contract to please speak to me at the conclusion of this brief."

Looking up at the Major, " Sir if I may. " standing and facing red team Natirash lowers his voice into a barely intelligable growl looking at everyone except the padawans, they seemed to be bored but they were at least being quiet and paying attention, " I dont know what kind of military unit you are all pretending to be, but I dont see any Special Forces here. Maybe you all have forgotten how a military unit is supposed to function, but its to accomplish the mission and keep your friends alive. The only reason I'm in charge is to instill discipline in this unit, and the last time I checked the reason we have these briefs is so we all have enough information to hopefully come back in one piece. So if you're all finished bickering, have a seat, drink a cup of caf and pay attention. " turning back to the Major " Thank you Sir. "

**Aft Briefing Room (1458)**
The officer adjusted his beige vest and activated the HoloNet projection of Thule. He seemed to be extremely embarrassed and humiliated at the events unfolding.
Major Kiernan: Ok then, listen up everyone. This mission to Thule is by order of me. We're being evaluated by the Jedi Praxeum and the Admiral herself. There is a lot riding on this mission and I suggest we all start acting like it."
He clicks a button and watches the planet of Thule rotate.
Major Kiernan: "Thule is located in the outer rim territories. It's arid with open plains and rocky terrain. Everyone will be in for a challenging movement groundside and you won't have much for concealment. Lightning constantly bombards the planet so your ears will be ringing and it might be tough to listen for things. Jurisdiction for this mission is New Republic military since the primary objective is investigating Falsoor. That means Lieutenant Kierlin calls the shots planet side and he is acting under my authorization. If for any reason there is a Sith Lord appearance the mission authority will go to padawan Woroken."
The major paces around while making sure everyone was still listening.
Major Kiernan: "As you all may have gathered, we have sufficient evidence to take action against Falsoor but not enough to bring them down. That's what your mission on Thule is all about. You're to gather any intelligence you can while searching for a lead on the missing Jedi Knight Mur Eva. Some of us feel that finding the Jedi there is unlikely, but still keep your heads up. While you're running this, the Jedi will be conducting their respective investigations. Lues Van will be heading to Vjun and Feldon will be consulting former Falsoor Headmaster Corlen Doris. The actual mission breakdown is as follows:"
A zoomed hologram of Thule can be seen. It shows the *Starshade* and an E-wing flying over the rocky hilltops of Thule.
Major Kiernan: "You're to have Chief Sunstalker scout the atmosphere of Thule. Once it's deemed safe the main body will fly in. The wing is to navigate to the coordinates loaded into your flight banks while avoiding any defensive networks. Red Team will set down 12 kliks outside of target site to avoid detection and trouble."

Woro stood to address the group, "Natireash is right. We need to work together, even if it is just to get out of this meeting," he says with a grin, not sure who could understand him. "But we have to work together, both newcomers and those who know each other a bit better. I assume the military wil be sending someone to locate the information we did not bring back. I am sure his ship will be easy to track. Now as to the Thule mission," he says, trying to get the team back on track, "exactly what should we expect there? I don't know much about the planet at all. Is it entirely Falsoor run, or are there other sentient beings there we can expect to deal with? Wil we have to go in in secret, or is there enough legitimate business there so we can just show up and not be immediately attacked?"

The hologram then changes to show the unit on the ground walking across the hilltops.
Major Kiernan: "You will then patrol to the target site. If you feel it is safe enough, you can also keep Sunstalker as air support orbiting the groundside patrol. Once you arrive at the target site, you are to evaluate the alleged Falsoor rendezvous point and gather any intelligence you can. We don't know what's actually at the target site. It is your job to recon what the target site is. Relay a message through your HoloNet comms to Dark Steed if you have any questions on intel items. Once you're finished at the target site, arrange for your own extraction. Your ROE's is to engage anyone who attacks you or anyone who observes you on the target site for an extended amount of time. If anyone is watching you at the target site, they are to be eliminated with extreme prejudice. You must try to keep your cover as long as you can to and from the target site. Also, remove any identifying marks that link you to the Republic. Leave your identichips here. We can't have anyone thinking this is an official action against Falsoor. Use your best judgment when dealing with these people; some of them may be innocent researchers. You will have 3 days to accomplish this mission and be on your way back to the Dark Stallion."
The major then pushes the button on the holoprojector and silhouetted figures appear on the display. It was a chain-of-command that read as follows:
Headquarters command: Major Kiernan -- call sign "Dark Steed"

Medical Element: Aymaric Destmaur -- call sign "Red Bacta"
Jedi Element: Awne Tora and Woroken -- call sign "Knight One and Knight Two"
After everyone gets a good look at this he clicks off the display.
Major Kiernan: "The Vjun refugees are encouraged to tag along as advisors to this mission. It is your discretion whether they go or not. As far as actual enemy contact on Thule is, we are not sure. It could be the reavers or attack droids. Most likely the enemy will attack on sight and if they do your orders are to return fire. You will return fire and break contact. Enemy contact is to be avoided at all costs. Is that clear to everyone? The SpecForces' base tactic applies: "Hit-and-run." Based on the intel we've gotten so far, you shouldn't run into any locals. If you do, try to keep your distance from them."
Major Kiernan: "I want everyone to pack 4 days worth of rations from supply. If you haven't already done so, you are all free to pick up Camo Scout armor and long-range comlinks. I want at least three of you to carry the radios on the patrol. Make sure someone is left in the *Starshade* to relay messages. If you guys lose all comm out there I'd advise you to RTB.

The attendants of the briefing began falling out. There was low chatter amongst the group as relaxation began to spread as tension dropped. Commander Meek was waiting next to the Holo system in anticipation of conversation.

After the meeting was over the Ewok immediately got up and made his way to the door, stumbling somewhat and bumping into Avarna. Was it on accident...or was it on purpose? Either way he nuzzles against her to show he was sorry and says "Sorry Lady..." He then makes his way out and waits by the side for Awne and Woro.

Kayli didn't hesitate, Upon her dismissal, she immediately left the briefing room, and was on the comlink. "Sev, I want to dust off in 20. Make sure you clear it with flight control. And I'd like at least a months worth of E-rats aboard, just in case."
Thats when the Ewok bumped into her. She shrugged. "Sure, Fuzzy Wuzzy." She replied disengaging from the critter, and double checking that everything was still in her pockets.
She waits for Vo'ren, and takes him by the arm and pulls him off to the side to talk with him. "I'm going to launch right away, since I don't have to wait for passengers and the like. Hopefully this will give me a few hours to do some air recon before you arrive."

Now that the meeting was over, and she could take her frustration of a certain female that she'd much rather...no...no..bad thoughts..those are dark side thoughts.
She shakes her head to rid her mind and focus instead on the Ewok "Come on Kaz, lets see about that comlink and weapon forr you."
She sighs faintly and looks up to the wookiee "I'm going to need something else as well, no one know hows to fix my saber and I don't have the skills for it." Sighing again she motions to the Ewok, "Come on Kaz, lets get going, we might have to talk to that Commanderr firrst." At the sight of the woman she growls in her direction making sure she would hear it. Though Jedi were well known for their patience and good will, this padawan had been having trouble with that last part.

Woro hustled to catch up with his two furry friends as the mission ended. He heard Awne complaining about her saber. "Awne, if we can't get your saber fixed before tomorrow, I am going to let you use mine. I have this, thanks to your credits," he pointed at the gleaming blades he had procured on the planet. Thanks to his training, he was almost as good with those now as his saber. "We can't very well have you without a saber, especially if there is a certain Sith running around down there." His tone indicated he would not hear no for an answer.
He patted Kaz on the head, as he asked if they would mind some company. Woro was a little nervous about the mission, and unlike the last few days, wanted some friends around.

The entire group of Red Team moved about the ship doing their different duties. Now they had a much tighter deadline to meet in response to Lieutenant Natirash. Aymaric Destmaur was just asked to join the Republic military under special binding conditions. The report from Corporal Vor'en detailed his loyalty to the squad and his medical expertise. Commander Meek was very intent to get him to join, especially for the Reaver operation. Was it wise for Aymaric? Did he still have a reliable contract under Falsoor?
Vor'en sat in the substructure inside of the waste tanks. The smell of all the different species' excrement was all the same to him. All of the waste came up to his knees and he had to scrub the tank walls for a good while. He also had to clean the filters which dumped the waste into space. It was not very becoming of a 501st veteran. The major was also nowhere to be found. Cleaning bodily waste up was just a part of military discipline unfortunately. The corporal found himself in the lowest of states, sweating profusely in the saturated air of stink.
In the hangar bay, Private Starfell was guiding workers onto the *Starshade* with all of the team's gear. He took careful notice of the speeder being repulsor-lifted up into the loading ramp. It would take at least 15 minutes to have everything properly stowed in the cargo bays. Private Starfell also noticed that mechanics were still conducting repairs on the freighter. The Lieutenant's timetable meant that pre-mission routines would be rushed.
Across the deck, R7 had finished the launch cycle for Kayli's E-wing and it was ready for flight. The woman climbed a ladder to her cockpit and slid into her seat. She looked up and saw the cockpit closing down. She heard the familiar sound of the enviroseal hissing to life. The deck officers made sure the area was ready and waved their glow sticks to dispatch the E-wing into space. Kayli eased the stick ahead and within seconds saw the stars envelop her senses in the cockpit. She heard the Hangar control voice echo out of her comm speaker as she guided away from the *Stallion's* hull.

Eriks had sat in the back of the room the entire time not saying a word. As everyone was let out he quietly let himself out ahead of everyone. He wanted nothing to do with the meeting and just wanted to get back to where he could be himself. As soon as he made it back to the hanger bay Vlad and Matsun were waiting. He quickly filled them in all the details. Vlad sighed "So we're not going in hot?"
"No but there's a good chance we're leaving hot. Make sure your sub-repeaters are in top shape and the you have all your power pack. I don't want anyone running out of ammo." Eriks said in a flat tone "Both of you are to be ready and on the ship fifteen minutes before it's ready to leave. If you have any questions save them for the trip." Both Vlad and Matsun knew Eriks was always like this before a mission. His carefree, playful, side always disappeared as soon as Eriks had all the details of a mission. They knew what he was going to do, double and triple check his equipment. They both remembered the mission where both his weapons jammed up on his and almost cost the three of them their lives. Eriks ended up taking the brunt end of the assault, mainly cause he stood in the way of all the blaster fire. After that they managed to meet up with another team and somehow Eriks still carried himself back to the shuttle, where he collapsed from blood lose. He had spent a week in a bacta tank and he still blames himself for it. As he walked out to the ship he had his full Como armor on, his CR-1 slung over his back and his light repeater under his right shoulder. The three men walked onto the ship and took their places.

The droid beeped and whistled in response to Kayli's command. It began calculating the route from its specialized compartment in the hull. Kayli imagined the route was not traveled much, but thankfully the Republic had pathfinders to scout hyperspace routes for the mission. That meant that the R7 unit had fairly new astrogation data in its memory banks to work with. A few minutes later, R7 confirmed that the coordinates for Thule were locked in. Kayli eased the lightspeed accelerator stick to the rear and watched as stars changed to starlines. At that instant, she zipped ahead into the blue hyperspace wormhole.

Approaching Major Meek, Aymaric had thoughts running through his head. Thoughts about self-preservation and sel-interest. He waited until anyone who had to speak to meek had departed, then stepped up close to the Major, presenting a datapad. "Sir, on that datapad is my list of required equipment. Most of it is what I had before I came on board, but there are a few items I will need you to accept and furnish before I agree to stay with Red Team." He continued speaking while the officer looked over the datapad. "As far as your proposal to be part of the Republic military, I must decline. My contract with Falsoor is very straight forward about unfullfilled agreements and I need to look at my best interests. Your military and government are strong on severeral respects, but when it comes to fighting legal battles with corporations, you will lose."
Taking a quick deep breath to replinish his lungs and his nerves, he continues before Meek has a chance to speak. "In summary, what I am asking for is to be an independent operator working for myself. I will not hold any rank in your military and I will not be treated like a Soldier. I will have the autonomy to act as my own agent, and the officers on this mission will be briefed on this thoroughly. The money I have asked for will be paid before I leave this ship, there are no negotiations on this. If you are unwilling to supply me with the additional equipment I listed, then the cost to hire me will be double."
Another deep breath and as stern a look as he can muster. "I know the equipment I am requesting is not the normal low bidder stuff you provide your troops, but I also know that you Republic Officers keep your own stashes of high grade equpiment stashed in case you actually have to get your hands dirty." This last comment was a bit more harsh than he wanted it to be, but he had to make sure Meek understood that Aymaric knew what he was asking for. His prior military experience, though limited, had given him some insight into the workings of the Galactic Republic.
He really didn't know what he would do if Meek did not agree to his terms. He had no desire to go home or to go back to Vijun. He barley had a desire to do anything but sit and read his data books.
"Your choices are three Major. Agree to my terms, let me continue on with my life at Falsoor or Execute me right here. Because if I do head back to Falsoor, they will want to know what's going on." A realization crosses the man's mind. " And any attempt to imprison me will cause me to make as much trouble for you as I can, including press realease of all the information I have on your operations on Vijun, your illegal operations."
He had barley taken a breath in the last few seconds. He waited for Meek's response.
((PERSUASION+4 and an FP +2d6 to convince Meek to bend to Aymaric's demands. The only extra items inluded with his old equipment are a GTU AV1S Scout Armor from S&V, Blaster Subrepeating from S&V and an IM-6 Medical droid from the clone wars. Last but not least, 50,000 credits. It's a lot, I know. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> ))

If you don't fulfill your obligation to help us, you're going to be responsible to pay the Republic back. It's only fair we get our money's worth out of you. This isn't the Rebellion anymore. We don't take anybody out of the fringe and let them leave whenever they want. And remember kid, it's a two way street. You don't fall under our command, so our uniformed men will unfortunately take priority over you. Otherwise, I have no problems as long as you sign a contract on this agreement."

Surprised but not shocked, Aymaric grinned slightly as he responded to the Major. "Have the equipment I asked for and a credit chip in the amount I want brought to my room. Have an agreement brought as well and when I am satisfied that there were no.." Bringing both hands up to make quotations. "Administrative errors, I will sign the forms."
Leaving the data pad with Major Meeks, Aymaric makes an abrupt about face and heads towards the briefing room door.
"Oh, one last thing Major. I will need to have full access to your med bay. The medical equipment you send your Soldiers out to the field with is severly lacking and I need to make sure your troops get the best aid they can if I am going to help them at all."

Commander Meek: "That's Commander. Please at least learn our titles out of respect. And yes, you will get full access to our medical equipment pending your verification of medical licensing. I will go arrange your request though."
The officer left the briefing room and went about his business.

***Starshade* Aft Cargo Hold (1601)**
The ewok was rummaging through the plasteel bins and plasteel crates even as they were still being loaded onto the ship. Private Starfell eased a crate down with a metallic clank with the help of another soldier. He looked up at Corporal Vor'en.
Private Starfell: "That's the last one loaded. I guess everything's prepped for take off. It seems our new LT has been looking out for us. That speeder will come in handy for reconnaissance.The technicians are doing some last minute pre-flight checks for us."
The private watched the ewok going through the weapons.
Private Starfell: "Hey fuzzy tail! Those aren't rock slings in there, be careful!"
As Kaz 'Jee went through the equipment, he saw that everything was too difficult for him to use. They were certainly not like spike pits or bows he was used to from Bright Tree Village. Even the long-ranged pack radio was not like anything he'd ever seen. While he was looking, his eyes caught something that had a white tarp over it. It seemed to be a large weapon he hadn't seen before and it caught his attention.

Kaz'jee looks up to Starfell and waves him off dissapointedly "Acha...Acha..." He then sees the tarp and looks around before quickly running over to it. Perhaps here would be a weapon for him t use? Being all curious as a true Ewok...he lifts up the white tarp and sticks his head under before crawling fully under it to examine the covered item.

***Starshade* Aft Cargo Hold**
The ewok crawled underneath the tarp and moved it out of the way. Dust leaped out everywhere as he uncovered the weapon. It was an enormous sword. The weapon was about 6 feet long and 6 inches wide. The blade was black with straight edges and a pointed tip. It seemed to be constructed of odd materials that Kaz Jee had never recognized. Obviously, the ewok would not even be able to pick the blade up much less use it in combat. It seemed this item had been tucked away by the crew of this ship and forgotten about.

Awne chuckles as she stands back watching the Ewok look through the crates. Though it seemed he found nothing he was having a good time. Glancing over to the side she nods to Vor'en before her ear flicks at sudden scampering feet. Looking sharply over she watches the Ewok go for the tarp.
Moving after him she lifts the tarp out of the way to see "What did you find Kaz..? what...what is that?" She frowns at it, brushing fingers over the hilt "odd weapon." She shakes her head and turns back to the crates to relook for something for the Ewok to use, she was taller perhaps she could find something he couldn't see.

Kaz'jee looks at the weapon before grinning "Ee chee wa maa!" He grabs it by the hilt and suddenly finds that he would not be able to lift it. That, however, does not mean he wouldnt be able to drag it all the way back to his quarters. He wanted a new weapon and by god he was determined. He had found this weapon so to him it was only right that he would keep it..he thought to himself. He starts to try and drag it while saying "Awne help Kaz'jee?"

The ewok, while attempting to scoot the weapon back, fell over quite comically. Private Starfell couldn't help but get out a laugh. Awne kept her eyes on the weapon trying to identify it.
She remembered it belonged to Lues and he didn't really talk much about it. It might be worth an inquiry later when time permitted.

The Ewok had fallen back and stays down for a few minutes, before standing and looking down...defeated by a gigantic and useless weapon. He takes his vibrodagger out and just looks at it sadly "Kaz'jee...stuck with you again..." A few more minutes pass before he whirls around and throws it away from him and Awne, as if he was throwing a primitive tomahawk. "No...-will- find better weapon...or use no weapon..."

Awne sighs as she watches the Ewok, moving back to him she leans down to pick up the sword "Come Kaz...i know who's this is but maybe he'll let you have it...how about we go and pick a rroom hm? I want to ask you something beforre I worrk on my saberr." She motions him to furthur inside the ship to pick a room, setting the sword there before leaving room and ship to return to her quarters.
Taking her bag of sorts she makes sure the helmet, the monsters saber and a few items of clothing were packed before returning to the ship and back into the room she had picked for herself and the Ewok, most likely the wookee would join them as most rooms had room for more than two.
Taking a seat on the floor she pulls the saber from her bag, and the crystal from her belt bag. She looks to the Ewok and pats the ground in front of her "I wanted to ask you something.." her tone was different the usual, softer and thoughtful, a tone that asked one to pay attention and to answer in truth.
"Imagine this situation...you have been capturred with thrree otherrs; a warrrriorr, a spirritualist, and a civilian. You arre all placed in differrent cells but you manage to escape.

Kaz'jee follows her sadly, though the sadness was dissipating as he was near her. Upon reaching the room he sits down and listens carefully to her question and tilts his head at the change of tone..and just the overall nature of what she was asking. Regardless, he closes his eyes and thinks carefully before opening them again.
"Kaz'jee would save...Civilian. A spiritual leader make peace with their god quickly...die to go be with them...able to watch over flock still. A warrior..." he taps his chest "Warrior ready to die...Sometimes even happy to die for cause. Civilian has none of these...scared...weeping, alone...no comfort, and just as important as any other individual. So Kaz'jee save...civilian."
He awaits her now, to say something in return.

### **zerah** (2010-01-17 15:00:33)

Awne nods her head though she gives no sign of right or wrong as there was no true answer only what the answer shows about the person. Saving the civilian shows compassion and understanding for life and that though we all must die someday, some were more ready then others to join the force.
From another perspective it showed that he understood that if he had saved either of the other two they would have risked their life as it was to save the civilian perhaps even dying in the process.
Now though it was time for the next question;
"Anotherr question then..." she says "You...hold the powerr that is farr grreaterr than any otherr in the galaxy, and you come upon one who had wrronged you in the past. Do you use this powerr to hurrt them as they hurrt you orr do you forrgive them?"

She looks down to her saber "I suppose I should rrepairr this beforre we get planetside." she looks to the Ewok "I will underrstand if you want to go and see the rrest of the ship, it will take me time herre and I need quiet."

Shaking his head the Ewok stays beside Awne and looks intently into her eyes with wonder "Want to stay please and watch? Promise to be quiet....and stay out of way." In truth he didnt really want to go anywhere. He wasnt going to find a weapon anytime soon, His eyes suddenly open wide with horror. He had left his weapon in the cargo hold! "Cant stay...forgot weapon!" With that he rushes back out the door, comes back and kisses her cheek with a friendly lick, before rushing off to search for his discarded weapon.

Commander Meek arrived along with another Republic soldier to supervise the signing of the contact. Aymaric observed it stated he had to help the Republic conduct the investigation toward Falsoor, and they reserved the right to reacquire any property if Aymaric defaulted on services. Aymaric was required to do field work on the investigation and serve as a medic. He was not given authority to make commands but he had to work with the group to not have his items reacquired. The deal went on without a hitch and they left the equipment on his bed. The funds were also transmitted to his account. It seemed Aymaric's career took a turn towards mercenary services. He checked his chrono and he noticed final rendezvous was in 15 minutes.

Looking to the crystal she had taken she holds it and simple looks to the color. She sighed, she wanted her purple one and though this crystal had great intrigued her she knew that it wasn't safe for her to have it attuned to her if it had made her insane. She shakes her head and stands, it wasn't safe, and she knew better....she did...really.
Gathering up the items she stows them in her bag, being gentle with her newly repaired saber and makes for the hold to find the Ewok, picking up her com as she walks "Negative, we could not find a weapon suitable forr him norr a comlink small enough forr his size." she moves to the hold to look for the Ewok, calling out for him.

Woro had been searching for Leus to no avail. When he had spoken to the Jedi immediately after the mission, there had been one question he had that he had forgotten to ask: what sort of mission was Mur Eva doing that led her into conflict with the Sith? How she got herself in that circumstance hadn't been explained to anyone, combining that with the strange uncomfortable look Leus gave at the meeting, made the wookiee wonder if there was yet another layer he had not been made aware of.
Woro, under a time constraint, gave up on speaking to Leus for the time. He instead went looking for Kaz, to get the "questioning" out of the way.
Finding Kaz walking in a corridor near the quarters, he asks the ewok to join him in the quarters he had been using. "Hey Kaz'jee, nice blaster!" pointing to the shiny new weapon Kaz was brandishing. "Would you mind coming with me for a few minutes so we can talk about something?"

This question was one the Woro had been asking himself lately, wondering if he could have mercy if he met up with the Sith that had taken his own Master.

Kaz'jee shakes his head as he answers the Wookie "Kaz'jee forgive them...because as told to Awne it not my place to condemn or do stuff like that...If justice is served to them...Kaz'jee not happy they die...If they captured, then Laz'jee can only hope that they are cured." He gives a nod to this and continues "Kaz'jee would...try very hard to not do anything bad...and take them to..what is word...law person...? But would forgive them...Reason why...is because while Kaz'jee forgives....Justice still needs to happen."

"Kaz, we have to go," Woro says getting to his feet after the buzz from the Lieutenant. "I don't have any more questions. But in response to what you told me earlier, do you have a preference on who would be your teacher? It would not offend either of us, no matter who you might prefer. You will be a good student for either of us. I will tell the Jedi Masters your preference, although they may have their own ideas about it."

**Hangar Bay 7 (1624)**
One hour passes and Red Team settles themselves in for their trip to Thule. The soldiers stowed their weapons securely as to ensure their would be no accidental discharges into the freighter's sensitive equipment. Lt. Kierlin and Vor'en set into the dual cockpit in preparation for launch. The deck officers guided the ship out with their glow sticks. The Lieutenant heard some chatter come over the radio as the ship was hovering across the deck.
Hangar Control: "*Starshade,* you are clear for departure. The *Dark Stallion* will move from this position in 3 weeks, make sure you are back before then. May the Force be with you. Out."
The light freighter then eased out of the hangar and cleared the hull of the capital craft. The pilot set a heading for hyperspace and input the stored coordinates into the navicomputer.
He awaited for the hyperspace route to be cleared by the computer and then prompted the crew to prepare for hyperspace travel. Kierlin pulled back on the lightspeed accelerator and watched as they jumped into the blue wormhole.

Kaz'jee had bit his lip at Woro's last question about who he preffered to train him. "Kaz...Kaz'jee not know how to answer...wish he could have two, both of you...." He looks down before smiling up to his now-brother as they made their way back to the ship "Kaz'jee...would prefer Awne...but will be happy with whoever teaches him."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the ship took off now, Kaz'jee sighs and looks over his 'old' crystal that Awne had given back to him. Thoughts race through his mind once again about training and fighting and other things of the like before going off in search of the Farghul. "Awwwneee?" He calls out, hoping she was near so they could talk.

Sarin rose from his meditation. He had been in a cell for so long he had forgotten how much time he had spent benind that dim blue field. The humming that was constant from the mechanical projectors reminded him of his own body in ways. The constant hiss of his respirator and the gentle triple thump of his organic heart beneath his armored chest as it was assisted by the life support servos that kept it beating. The giant had to hunch as clearly the cells were not designed for one of his height. His Leg servos whined slightly as they had not been used for much else than sitting all this time. Turning his head towards the wall bed he had tried to sleep on and quickly fell to the floor as the wall mounts gave way made him grunt. "Guard!" The giants voice regulator worked just as well as it had before, his roar carrying a loud terror with it as it echoed down the empty prison halls.

As the disturbance was made in the energy cell a Republic clad in a padded vest and helmet ran in front of Sarin. It was a bothan armed only with a stun baton. He looked curiously into the cell, trying to see through the shadows.
Republic guard: "What is it?"

The giant saw the small guard through the blue haze, his visor giving him a clarity to his sight. "I am ready to leave, what is it that you require?" "Speak to your masters and ask them what it is that i must do to free myself from this dismal prison." As he returned to a seated position on the floor, tired of hunching in the small room, he closed his eyes... or what was left of them and began the long task of weeding out the pain that often coursed through his body, and awaited an answer to his request.

The guard nodded and replied...
Republic guard: "I can do that. Please wait for me to get the person in charge of your case."
A few minutes pass after he makes a call via his comlink, and then a bothan Lieutenant shows up.
Lieutenant: "Well mister, it looks as if we have no evidence to keep you. Apparently this was the Jedi's issue and they have no real binding problems to hold you by. You're free to go and I apologize. Do you need us to take you anywhere?"

The giant gave a slight nod... "I am grateful, could you please ask your commander if he could take me to where the others i arrived with have gone if at all possible, and also if he could return my possessions to me." Sarin stepped out of the cramped sell and brought himself to his full height. With a great metallic groan the giant stretched his half machine body. Even the servos seems grateful to be stretched after being confined for so long. Sarin gave a glance around taking in the detention area of the ship. Perhaps a look around was in order... if nothing else it would help pass the time.

The guard goes and questions his superior, returning after a few minutes. He informs the cybernetic man that he can only have his weapons as he is leaving, not any time before. The Republic soldier was also not able to find out where Red Team was. It was likely their mission was top secret and many people aren't permitted to know about it. Sarin nevertheless walked into the bustling corridors of the *Stallion*. He checked a map from a computer on the wall to see all the various places he could visit.

Airlocks (likely to not be used).
Barracks
The Drifter (Popular Cantina).

Laboratories (Numerous, converted to use for reconnaissance purposes.)
Medical Bays (quite a few medical bays throughout).

Looking across the screen the giants bionic eyes immediately snapped to the small words listing "training room". Sarin turned back to the small man. "Thank you, your assistance has been much appreciated." The giant then turned and headed towards the training room, his bionic assisted brain making a mental note of the directions from the map screen. Sarin's body ached and combat was the best way to get it back in tune, not to mention all the time spent in the cells gave him little time to train and exercise. Hopefully he would find an opponent there that he would not have to hold back on. After that he would get a tune up to his bionics then try to find out where the group went. After all his crystal was not something he wanted to let go so easily and they would probably need his help, or he may need theirs... either way time was short and he had much to do. With a hurried pace the giant strode off to the training room his bionic body almost in excitement at the challenges he hoped awaited.

Sarin traveled the corridors past the bewildered Navy personnel. They were obviously intimidated by his size as they made way for him. He arrived at a lift and traveled to the 4th floor. Once there, he made the short walk to some double doors. They hissed open and he walked into a medium sized glossy black room. There were holo tiles throughout the black shining area. He looked over to the computer and arranged his training regiment.
*You can choose a difficulty level from 5-25. The higher the difficult the worse the strain on your character. You can be injured. But there is more XP for the higher difficulty. Also, what type of combat do you want to improve? You can pick H2H, melee, blaster targeting, Force wielding, or deflecting.*

The giant found himself eager to be in the combat, pushing lvl 20 melee combat was an easy choice. Sarin knew the opponent would be a major challenge. Taking in a deep breathe Sarin reached for a vibroblade and prepared himself for the fight.

Sarin takes on hordes of holographic enemies. Once he strikes them in a sufficient place they disappear. After about 15 minutes of sweat and swinging limbs, he encounters a Force vision.
He had the vision of his master, who was far away. His old associates who he traveled with were in danger...but it all seemed to come and go. What was going on?
Nevertheless, he continued his tiresome regimen. Unfortunately, he found he wasn't able to get much from the training as he became really tired from the intense exercise. He could spend more time in the training quarters if he wished.
*Sarin gains 100 XP.*

Sarin flexed his non bionic arm, or the least bionic arm in any case. His servos were still pushing. The giant called over the comm for a medic and pushed the difficulty up to level 25, the fight would push his body to his limits, but that was where a warrior of his power needed to be... right on the edge. Sarin flexed his claws and gripped his sword and a smile crept across his tortured face. Sarin charged into the fray using his rage to push his body to its max. He could feel his bionics pushing past their limit and knew that unconsciousness would soon follow. Perhaps the chaos would bring the images back, maybe he could understand better what had pushed through his mind. Battle... it was like air in his lungs, like fresh blood in his veins. It brought him a peace he seldom felt.

Sarin engaged the lightning fast holograms with fervor. The images disappeared one by one as he swiped away with powerful slashes. In a matter of minutes, Sarin had dispatched all the images. He collapsed from fatigue and felt that he couldn't carry on anymore training lest he risk an injury or mechanical failure.
*Sarin moves -1 on the condition track but gains 1500 XP.*

Exhausted and near collapse the giant asked the medic to escort him to the sick bay, and to bring someone able to work on his bionics. His whole body, organic and inorganic, needed repair. His entire body had been pushed to the limit and every minute of it had excited him to his dark core. "Also, could you ask your commander, Admiral Ordani I believe, to meet us in med bay? I have something to ask of the Admiral. With that the giant headed to medical eager of the rest that awaited.

An ithorian escorted Sarin to the rear of the frigate. Within moments they were in the medical suite and bypassing various sterile rooms. The ithorian escorted the behemoth to a medical bed and a cylinder shaped droid rolled up to him getting his vitals. The ithorian was adjusting the med scanner over the creature when he spoke. The large room was littered with medical personnel going about their work. A murmur of low conversations could be heard by Sarin.
Ithorian: "I'll see if I can get her. Don't get your hopes up she is quite busy."
He made a comlink transmission and surprisingly the Admiral arrived at the treatment area in a few minutes. Her uniform was well-pressed and decorated with medals, she quickly got to the point.
Admiral Ordani: "Can I help you?"

The giant was near motionless on the bed, his helmet hid the shape of his tortured face from the admiral, and any hint of emotion was lost behind the dark visor of the custom fitted mandalorian helmet Sarin wore. One of the few reminders of his lost past. "Admiral, I have a favor of you... please send me to meet with the team that left." Sarin turned his helmeted gaze towards the Admiral. "They are going to need my help."
