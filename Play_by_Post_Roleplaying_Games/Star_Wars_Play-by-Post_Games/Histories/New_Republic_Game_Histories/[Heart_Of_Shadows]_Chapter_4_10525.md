# [Heart Of Shadows] Chapter 4

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-23 01:23:55)

Hadru stretches his feelings out to become united with the Force. He has a very comforting feeling about approaching the Embassy. The group indeed had a lot of their mind and no doubt even more to discuss. The weariness of battle coupled with the weight of problems in their mind was overwhelming, and now they just desperately wanted safe passage to their haven. Rith did not seem like he was coping with his problems well. The Jedi held some special favoring to this group of mercenaries and fringers. You all weren't sure why other than it had something to do with the Force. It was obvious that some members of Red Team were even thinking of leaving despite the Jedi's request to stay due to the sensitive mission, and the prospect of taking the Republic contract. No matter why the reasons this group had endured hardships together, you begin to wonder if the Jedi Master was right about your destinies being linked.
The expansiveness of the open area comes to a close as you approach the Republic guards flanking the Embassy main door. They nod respectfully to the Jedi and the rest of you. Once you feel the cool air wash over you, you feel safe and comforted. The Jedi Master turns to you all and speaks.
Lorhas: "Feldon will be happy to tend your wounds if you want to make your way to the Med Bay. I'll be getting something to eat in the mess hall if you need me."
*It is now 9:45 am, and you all have gotten hungry/thirsty.*

Awne's legs almost gave out on her once they crossed into the safety of the embassy, indeed she stumbled a little but gained her footing. Gently she takes Riths hand, giving it a light squeeze before releasing it as she moves to the med bay. She was so tired her body was starting to shake now that adrenaline was leaving.
Once inside the med bay she'd look around for the jedi healer, at least she trusted him "...Feldon?"

Saracia is greatful, that they all made it back to their refuge. And, she is doubly greatful; to be out of the miserable dry heat and sun of Tantooine.
â€œThank you, Lorhas. I will see the wounded to the Med Bay. There, I will attend anyone needing or wanting care. Then, I can eat.â€
Saracia continues to help Voren to the Med Bay and onto a table. When she sees the Jedi Healer, â€œFeldon, You should treat Awne and her mate. After what they have been through, they deserve to be treated by someone, they trust. I will tend to any and all of the others, if they wish it.â€

Awne blushes at the term for Rith, her tail flicking in embaressment "h..he's not my mate.." she mumbles looking to see if he was with her, if he were she'd blush more as her tail would wrap around his ankle for a moment "neverr asked him to be...dunno if he'd even want to be."

Hadru finally let his guard down when they reach the inner sanctuary of the embassy. This time he welcomed the cool air and he carried a warm feeling in his heart. Vor'en and the others were alive, and he was able to help them as they had helped him. They were a capable and resilient group, he admired there toughness and will to fight, especially Vor'en. Hadru held great respect for the man but he hid his feelings. Vor'en was a brave solider never backing down, and fighting to save his friends while severely wounded. Hadru let the wounded go to the Medical Bay and he followed Lorhas to the mess hall.
Inside the mess hall Hadru grabs some ready to eat snacks and a grabs a cup of cool water. His thoughts were dwelling on the Qiraash and her unique abilities, Hadru remembered Feldon doing something similar to him when he was wounded.
Hadru asks Lorhas plainly as a child would ask a parent.
'What is the Force?'
((OOC The Qiraash is female , right?))

Xander will tag along with Hadru to the mess hall and grab some chow as well. He takes his helmet off and sets it down and starts eating when he hears Hadru asking about the force he looks up and listens to the response.

Woroken still was not in tip top shape, but he was completely ravenous after the long day. He knew after eating Feldon could heal whatever minor wounds reamained. He followed most of the team to the kitchen area, and began wolfing down his meal. He listened intently to the discussions between Hadru and Master Lorhas.

Walking into the med bay, Vor'en finds a bed to lay down on. He is exhausted and beaten. "Anwe, I am sorry. I did what I could to get out of there to get help fortunately our Jedi friends where able to find you frist. For that I own them." Vor'en closes his eyes and thinks back to all the things that have happened resently. "I lied my way out, by telling them I still had conection with the Remant. Which I do not. If I was to go back there they would shot me on site." He takes a painfull deep breath and continues. " I told them that I could get there money. All I had to do was make contact and they get it." "After they released me I contacted felzor and told him what had happened. He could get involed so I was on my own. I was trying to figure out how to get you guys out when Hardu called me and I ran to help free you." Vor'en rubs in fore head. "I would never put you ar any of the others in danger. I am sorry for what happened to you and poor Ben and I will make it up some how."
"If this is not acteptable then I will leave." Vor'en's hand goes ro his side. "I have tried to do my best to keep everyone safe. I have screwed it up and I have no way of fixing it accept to try harder next time." "That is the whole story." He turns to the Jedi in the medbay with them. "I did find out why they Imps. havn't attacked here. They have made some kind of arangements with the Hutts so they stay out."

Awne sighs from where she stood, slowly growing more and more tired "you told them a lot morre than that Vorr, but I forrgive you...you'rre lucky you told me all that while I'm still tirred." she grins at him and moves to a bed slightly away from the others. She sits with a groan "Starrs above I think I could sleep forr a few days.."

### **ganthet** (2008-04-23 11:35:32)

"They would have found out about the NR anyway and I told Felzor about that allready." Vor'en trys to think back to when times where simpler, he can't seem to remeber a time when life was simple. Working for the Hutts, running from his past. It all seemed like one big blur. "I have done alot of things I am not proud of. This team isn't one of those. I promice I will try harder in the future." After vor'n is done talking he slowwly driffs off to sleep.

Inwardly, Saracia thinks to herself; whether its mates, sister protecting a brother, or a mother caring for its child; Awne has a deep connection to Rith. There is no denying it. She is about to apologize for her mistake, when Voren speaks up.
Saracia is pleased to have this respite. She feels her being becoming itself, once more. *full action(s), removing condition(s)*
When Voren and Awne finish talking, Saracia asks Voren, â€œIs it alright for me to tend your wounds or would you prefer Feldon?â€ Saracia looks over to Awne for her reaction, not wanting to draw her ire any further.
***OOC1:** Yes, Saracia is female. I made Saracia female, because, I had only a picture of female Qiraash. Though, I am male.*

Awne gives her a look growling softly, she still didn't trust the female and didn't want any strange 'healers' near her packmates. Still..she stops growling as she thinks, the female did help them, and did support Vor until they got back. She hmphs and turns away slightly, a small sign that she wouldn't get in the way but the way her tail flicked on the bed said she'd be watching.

Saracia interprets Awneâ€™s low growl, as a warning to a possible threat. So, Saracia decides to hold off on healing until her patient gives her permission or Feldon tells her to take care of it. Meanwhile, she stands there in a light trance letting her aura recover from the stress of the earlier evening.
*Recovering condition steps, while waiting*

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-24 01:42:18)

*Saracia recovers her conditions after sitting down for a while, catching her breath.* The corridor thins out quickly as the members of Red Team disperse to handle their necessities. Lorhas watches the young boy inquire about the Force and he responds in a kind tone.
Lorhas: "I don't have much time to explain it, but I can sum it up. To put it simply, the Force is a
energy field that is in everything. It IS everything, and it governs every aspect of life that you could possibly imagine. It also has more control over existence than you'd think. Trust me, you and your companions will get a more in depth explanation later. I must contact someone of great importance. Please get some food and rest, and have your wounds tended to if you have any."
The Jedi walks deeper in the corridor as his footsteps clank against the grated floor. He quickly disappears from view.
In the med bay, Feldon and two medical technicians are preparing the medical beds that Red Team had grown all too familiar with. The various electronic medical machines began to hum to life. You'd be willing to bet it was the most advanced technology on Tatooine. Feldon notices Saracia tending to the patients.
Feldon: " I'm so glad everyone is ok, you seem to attract a lot of trouble. You all do manage to stay alive though in a rough place like this. You've thoroughly impressed my master, to a degree. Saracia, I'd like a full brief on your experience in the field once we've gotten the patients under our care."
Feldon seems to overhear Vor'en as he speaks about the Imperials.
Feldon:"Hmm, you have information why the Imperials have stayed out of Mos Esre? Master Lorhas might want details about that."

Awne looks over at the human still standing and frowns. With a soft groan she stands again and moves to his side, taking his hand in hers and leading him to a bed. Softly she whispers to him as she helps him to lay down "what..do you think about..um..that..mate comment?"

Rith massages his bruised face and sighs.
Rith: "It sounds good, but I'm dealing with a lot of internal problems that I didn't know about when we first met. I can't stop thinking about my lack of memory, and how I lashed out on Radon. I was intent to be a murderer, and I don't know if that was even me because I don't know who I am."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-24 02:15:23)

Rith: "I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but I'm dealing with a lot lately. I don't even have time to sort out the problems right now with what we are all going through. I mean, I could have just accepted arrest and avoid all this danger."

Awne shakes her head "I had half expected you to not even conciderr it. I underrstand Rrith, I rreally do. Don't worrrry about his now, lets deal with everrything else." She sighs softly at his comment of accepting arrest "Rrith..would you have rreally wanted that?"

Woroken finished up his stew, and listened to the small talk between the members in the kitchen. He pulls his weary frame up from the table, and walks to the medical area.
"Hey Feldon, long time, no see. Don't suppose my bed is still open is it? I need to bit more healing, if you can spare any."

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-24 09:25:56)

Saracia feels like herself, once again. She should be taking care of the wounded and hates waiting around for permission. If their initial contact was in the Med Bay, there probably would not have been any problem. They felt safe here and would have expected her to start healing them, as they arrived. But, having just been tortured, their response is understandable with a stranger coming up in a combat zone.
Saracia is about to ask Feldon, if she should start taking care of Voren, when the Wookie comes in. *At last! I can get to work. He will allow me to work on him.*, Saracia thinks to herself. As she moves over to the Wookie, a warmth starts infusing her being. â€œFeldon is taking care of Awne and her â€˜friendâ€™ Rith. Your comrades have not given me permission to heal them, yet. It would lessen Feldonâ€™s work load; if you allow me to finish, what I started. Just take a seat there, there is no need for a stay in the bed. As long as, you do not mind.â€

The wookiee nodded his head in affirmation, and clapped Saracia on the shoulder in a playful way. "Never mind, Feldon," he said as he took the chair and waited for the healer to begin her work. He was pleased to allow her to heal him, hoping the rest of the group would follow his lead. Apparently, there had been a bit of resistance to allowing her "in" the group, so to speak. Woroken considered himself a good judge of character and he immediately was fond of Saracia.

Vor'en sleeps wher he fell. He is not really bothered by the sounds of the med bay or who is working on him. As he sleeps he dreams of time he had to run for his life after he shoot and killed his Commanding Officer. He still remebers the sounds of the other troopers blaster cutting down civilians who had done nothing other then be at the wrong place at the wrong time. He can almost smell flesh burn, the ozne from blaster bolt being discharged. It was one of the most horrorifing days of his life he could save them.
He looks down at one of the bodys, smoke still rising from it. It seems a little out of place to him, like it shouldn't be there.*"I don't remeber this one there where only the civilians, this one is differnet some how."* Vor'en bends down to look closer and he is right it wasn't one of the towns people that the Troopers had cut down, It was young Ben.*" Why is he here is isn't right?"* Then the body starts to move, it looks up at him. "Why didn't you save me Vor'en? You let me Die. Why? I trusted you."
Suddenly Vor'en jumps up. He is panicked, Like he is looking for a place to hide to get away from something. His hand still holding the blaster comes up. Then he realizes where he is. He is in the med bay and his friends are all there, and alive. He looks around alittle asahamed of his actions. "Sorry everyone. Must have just been the stress from the everything that has happened. I'm fine." Vor'en knew what he said wasn't true he had the same dream or nightmare before. He had learned to live with what had happened in his past.

Saracia feels the warmth within her, growing stronger*(FP, Fools luck)*. When she touches the Wookieeâ€™s arm to start her healing, she get a reflexive felling of warmth. Grabbing a nearby chair, Saracia places it in front of the Wookiee. She takes a his left hand in her right and his right in her left. With them sitting facing each other and holding hands, Saracia says, â€œI like to treat the whole person. As I heal, it will feel like you are getting a massage. So, donâ€™t worry. Ask any questions, if you have any concerns about what you are feeling or what I am doing.â€
Saraciaâ€™s hands seem to warm up, in turn warming yours. The warmth first continues down your fingers gently massaging the muscles. With your hands relaxed, the warmth starts heading up both arms, relaxing the muscles, as it proceeds. When the warmth approaches the wounded area on your arm, you see tensing on Saraciaâ€™s face, as the woundâ€™s pain is washed away. The warmth and massage from each arm continues into your chest, meeting up in the middle. It continues to fill your torso, then continues working its way to the ends of your other extremities.
The warmth and massage is similar to having just finished a leisurely hot bath without the wetness. But, like any bath, you get out and dry off. The warmth starts receding back the way it came. It lingers a bit right around the wounds, before returning to Saraciaâ€™s hands.
The entire process only took a minute or two. But, it leaves Woroken body is physically refreshed, reminiscent of just finished stretching oneâ€™s arms after a good nightâ€™s sleep. The wounds are almost completely healed *(+9 HP)*.
Saracia had taken Worokenâ€™s pain *(-1 cond)*. By taking her time to heal, she was able to recover, as the warmth receded back to her. During the curing, Saracia got the distinct feeling: She was meant to be here and with these people. With her purpose, renewed, Saracia decides it is time to be more assertive. No one was going to prevent her from fulfilling her destiny.
â€œA little bacta will take care of the last little bit.â€, Saracia tells Woroken, as she releases the Wookieeâ€™s hands. She stands up, goes to the medical supplies, grabs a small container and returns. Gently, she places the bacta ointment on the tiny scar left. *(This finishes up the 1 missing HP, but, could have done 8 more.)* â€œThere, all done.â€
Saracia was about to challenge Awne on taking care of the human soldier, when he wakes up with a start. Saracia rushes over to Voren. â€œJust lay back. I will take care of your wounds. I shouldnâ€™t have waited for your permission.â€ Saracia places her hand on Vorenâ€™s chest and repeats the procedures with him. It should be easier for him to fall asleep, with his body relaxed and wounds healed. *(Voren, Up to +14 hp, fully cured 36 to 49*
***OOC1:** Worokenâ€™s Force Treatment: **9 hp** - Take 10, +14 UtF, +5 Foolâ€™s luck, -15 First Aid DC, -5 2nd FA in a day. Last HP taken care of by regular first aid.
**OOC2:** Vorenâ€™s Force Treatment: **14 hp** â€“ Take 10, +14 UtF, +5 Foolâ€™s luck, -15 First Aid DC*

Awne looks up from where she was leaning over Rith to glance at Voren. 'Trruama induced nightmarre.' she thinks, remembering something along those lines a medic and mumbled in passing her long ago. She frowns at the woman still not fond of her just yet, but if the others were ok she'd try and warm up to her..try. 'But if she comes nearr my Rrith..' she thinks to herself, she'd rather have the jedi do it; at least she knew him and trusted him. Shaking her head she turns back to the human to wait for his reply, her hand lightly brushing his cheek as her tail flicks slowly by her feet. She was in pain, but it could wait.

Vor'en looks up at the woman. "Thank you . I am useally good with names but I seem to have missed your." Vor'en closes his eyes at let's her work. "How are the others?" He asks.
Not really waiting for here answer to either question. Vor'en starts to relax agian. "Soory if I scare anyone. It is an old dream I have from time to time is all." Vor'en turns to Feldon. "Tell your Master that the Remant will not attack here because they have made a deal with the Hutts. I don't know what the details are but we will need to find the guy you where looking for. Life has just got more complicated."

Woroken decided that the new healer might even be better at her profession than Feldon. Both of them were clearly much better healers than the wookiee. Woro was able to combat medic decently, but these two took healing, through the Force apparently, to a new level. When Lorhas began training the wookiee, he definitely wanted to learn how to feel that efficiently.
He nodded in thanks to Saracia, and moved out of her way, so she could work on Vor'en who was in much worse shape the Woro was.

â€œI am Saracia. I donâ€™t think, we have met before.. Iâ€™ve been working with Feldon, couple days a week. With the attack on the compound, he sent me there for medical support. I have pieced together , that she is Awne.â€, as she tilts her head over in Awneâ€™s direction. â€œHer friend is Rith. But, I donâ€™t know your or his name.â€, nodding in Worokenâ€™s direction.
â€œI should take care of your wounds now. Feel free to talk or ask questions.â€, as she places her hands on Vorenâ€™s chest. The warmth and relaxed muscles start in the chest and radiate outward to the extremities. But, otherwise, the healing proceeds like the Worokenâ€™s. After a minute or two, Voren is much refreshed and all wounds cured.

Feldon approaches Rith as he is in the medical bed. He pulls a medical machine over towards him and retrieves a scanner. He flicks it on and begins looking over Rith for any internal injuries.
Rith: "Hey Feldon, I'm having a lot of internal problems."
Feldon: "It's not showing up, no internal bleeding."
Rith: "I don't mean that, I mean emotionally...as well as my memory. I can't explain it well, but it feels like some type of void is growing inside me."
Indeed Feldon had been locked in the medical world where it seemed he could no longer see the gray areas in life. Anybody who knew anything about the Jedi would guess this kind of life style would be detrimental to a Jedi's code.
Feldon: "We found no traces of it in your brain pattern. But, The Force is telling me you are not being dishonest. I'll have a deeper look at it when the more urgent injuries are taken care of."
The young Jedi applies a bacta shot to Rith's arm. After that, he begins using ointment and bandages to soothe the burns on Rith. He also bandages the bruises and a few other things. He plugs Rith into his IV machine and looks to the group.
Feldon: "Rith seems ok, but he'll need total bed rest. If you need him for anything I'd count him out for eight hours."
*You all recover the HP listed from Saracia if she treated you. If you've been eating in the mess hall you are no longer hungry. All negatives on the condition track have been removed.*

Awne watches over the two men carefuly, worry for Rith and his memories. Once Feldon was done she nods her head with a sigh, and leans over Rith's form again, laying her lips to his in a soft kiss before smiling at him "Rrest up Rrith." She then moves to the bed beside his and climbs in, laying down with groan/sigh..so really she groaned a sigh.

*Awne, Saracia, and Vor'en gain 100 experience for roleplaying on the 23rd. Awne regains 23 hp.*
Feldon places his hand on Awne's forehead. She slowly but surely feels the pain subsiding in her body. Within minutes, she can feel the burns being soothed and her wounds mended. After five minutes of this treatment, Feldon begins applying ointment to Awne's burn spots. He also injects a fluid that will relax her muscles that have undergone violent spasms and repair them. She began to feel very drowsy with comfort.

### **zerah** (2008-04-24 14:33:59)

Awne sighs with the treatment, her tail moving over her stomach to flick lazily as she relaxes. She smiles up at the Jedi "Thanks Feldon." and looks over to Rith again with a smile before closing her eyes, deciding sleep would be good. She thinks about her favorite spot back home and smiles as the last thought to enter her mind before falling asleep was *'I'd like to show Rrith that place someday.'*

Feldon stands and looks at Saracia.
Feldon: "She needs bed rest too, what is your evaluation on your patients?"

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-24 15:15:02)

Saracia pays careful attention to Rith, as he describes his condition. Mentally, she takes stock with the clues given: *memory trouble, emotional trouble, void growing within him, no abnormalities noted in brain pattern.* Taking in all her scholastic knowledge *(+9 on all knowledges, but, tactics)* and the symptoms, Saracia tries to come up with a diagnosis or explanation. She stands by, as Feldon works on Rith and then Awne.
When he finishes and asks her a direct question, she responds. â€œBoth of my patients are fully healed. Plus, I have relaxed or massaged their muscles, so, they should get good rest. So, their immediate medical concerns are handled.â€
Indicating Voren with a wave of her hand, â€œHe has been through a tramatic event in the past. I donâ€™t know, if it is a persistent problem or if it was triggered by an recent event. Though, by what he said, I would lean toward the later.â€
â€œAs soon as, I could, I started to heal Awne. After her ordeal, I can not fault her for taking offense or fearful of a stanger touching her. She took great offense toward me. Which prevented me from healing her or Rith. Both of them deserve a long rest.â€
Saracia blushes a bit, â€œI should apologize, for not letting you know about my full abilities. I can treat most medical conditions, by using only force. You probably noticed, I tended to use minimal instruments for diagnosis and healing. I was also fully trained in non-force medical applications. I believed it best to hide this, with the history of the defunct Empire purging the Jedi and also, hunting down members of my species.â€
â€œI have been watching you and how you treat. It seems to me, you are using Imposed Trance technique for healing injuries.â€ She hesitates a bit, â€œI think, Jedi refer to it as Vitality.â€
*OOC: Let me know, what type of diagnosis/explanation I can come up with.*

Xander will use this down time to field strip his weapons and gear. Providing them with vital preventive maintence. He strips down the modified blaster and makes a note of its many improvements.

Woroken introduces himself to Saracia. Doubtful she would understand him, he growls over to Feldon, and asks if he might help a little with the introductions. Just as he was asking Feldon, the two Force healers began a conversation of their own about their own particular healing methods.

Xander works away on his equipment feeling himself just kind of slip away into a working trance he doesn't really think about what he is doing he just does it. Anyone watching might notice that when Xander reaches for a tool or piece of equipment thats just out of reach the part slides close enough for him to grab and continue his work with out pause.

Xander breaks down the modified blaster pistol. The most notable upgrade seems to be its focusing emitter for the blaster crystal, it would cause more damage to soft targets. It also has a reinforced barrel to endure the heat of the auto fire. The trigger has also been modified to adapt to auto fire. He recognizes that this weapon would be considered illegal due to its high rate of fire and being able to conceal it.
In an hour and five minutes, Xander estimates he'll be able to repair the weapons and clean them. They should be fully functional again, and should fire with no problems.

After an hour passes Xander blinks a few times and looks around. He sees he has finished with the weapons.
"Hmm less time than I thought. Hey Woro whatcha doing big guy? What are we doing with these spare weapons?
Xander gets up and stretches his legs and puts his armor back on. He adjusts his new pistol on his thigh and then puts his all-temp cloak on so it blocks the pistol from view.

Hadru watches Lorhas walk away, and turns to Xander with a curious and perplexed look then bites into a snack and sips on his cool water. He doesn't know what to say to such a ridiculous answer to a simple question. Hadru doesn't speak and keeps quite.
((OOC: I posted this 3 times now, and the first two times it was blocked for some reason. So this would have been up further for Xander to respond. Something weird happened and Rowen had to reset my privileges. BTW Xander I think we are in the Mess Hall and Woro is in the Med Bay.))

"Nice to meet you too, Saracia," the wookiee exclaims, suprised that the newcomer can understand shriwook. "It's a pleasure to meet someone who can understand me. Thank you for the healing earlier. You are quite skilled. How did you come upon us?" He was blurting out short quick sentences, genuinely excited that there was someone he could speak to other than the Jedi.

Feldon looks at Saracia, patiently awaiting an answer.
Feldon: "What did you gather from their evaluation Saracia?"
Shortly after he speaks, the Lt. Frelzor walks in.
Frelzor: "Hi you guys, I'm hoping for a speedy recovery. That contract has warmed up for you very well. Reela has gotten anxious and awaits a response from us. All my other operatives are in the field right now. So have you guys really stirred up trouble with the local Hutt gang?"

*(OOC: Answering Worokenâ€™s question, before previous post to Feldon.)*
Answering Worokenâ€™s question, â€œI did not come upon you. Feldon knew about the assault and sent me for medical support.â€ When Feldon finishes, and asks for her evaluation of her patients, she tells Woroken, â€œWe can talk, later. I have to brief Feldon.â€
*(OOC: Trying to get us all at the same time frame. Saraciaâ€™s/Worokenâ€™s conversation happens. Then, Woroken getting quiet and listening to my previous post to Feldon about Woroken and Vorenâ€™s condition. Hopefully, we are all current now. Continuing in current time frame.)*
When Feldon asks her for her evaluation of her patients; Saracia isnâ€™t quite sure, what Feldon is asking for. When Lt Frelzor walks in speaking of some contract, she figures, it requires the various abilities of this group. Maybe, the question was on whether, they are in condition to go on this contract. She decides to let the otherâ€™s discuss the contract. Besides, it is there affair and their choice; whether to include me or not.
So, Saracia tries to answer the posed question, â€œFeldon, I am not completely sure, what you specifically are asking. All of Worokenâ€™s and Vorenâ€™s wounds are healed. Should they get a good nightâ€™s rest? Yes. Is bed rest medically necessary, right now? No. I have noticed, they have been in previous combats, recently. Plus, while wounded, Voren really exerted themselves. My evaluation of their condition: Within a couple of hours, they should be going to bed to get a good nightâ€™s rest. Their bodies and psyche can recuperate from the their recent endeavors. But, if they are immediately needed for some purpose, they could put off sleep for a few more hours.â€
Looking carefully for Feldonâ€™s reaction, â€œBut, I get the impression, you are asking for something very specific and whether I noticed it. If I am right, I would prefer a direct question.â€
*(OOC1: I didnâ€™t see anyone with any condition damage on their signatures. If they do have them, she would have noticed them and would require rest.)
(OOC2: Perception: +14 â€“ to see if Feldon is looking for something more/specific.)*

While Xander stripes his weapons down and takes care of them Hadru seems interested, he takes a seat next to Xander and watches him work.
'Guns are new to me, I don't know how to maintain them only load and pull the trigger.'
The young boy puts his two weapons down sharing the table with Xander trying to emulate what he is doing, but its hard because Xander is so fast and efficient. His slug throwing pistol and his sporting blaster rifle look second hand, rugged,and worn from recent sandstorms but functional. He takes out his tools from his utility belt and starts to work inadequately on his weapons .

"Here it is like this."
Xander takes the gun and shows Hadru how to field strip it.
"You pop those out take the slide off like this see. The you take out the bolt and the firing pin. You really gotta clean these slug throwers often or you get alot of carbon build up. They use a chemical reaction to expell the metal slug. Basically its a contained and directed explosion that forces the slug out. You get this black residue that builds up in your chamber and on all your parts if you don't clean it eventually its gonna jam up. Here wipe that down and when your done take these swabs and clean this out. Once thier clean take this lube and oil up this and this."
Xander takes his time and goes slow showing Hadru the basics.

Saracia watches Feldon and she observes that it seems like he didn't want anything more specific. Feldon responds to what Saracia is saying,
Feldon: "Well, you are correct with your response in this case. A lot of times in this field you will not have the luxury of someone double-checking your work, everyone will busy with their own patients. You have to make the best decision you can and trust your instincts. I'll take a look at them and see what needs to be done."
Feldon carefully checks Saracia's patients, after he is finished, he looks back up at Saracia.
Feldon: "You definitely handled it well, now you just have to trust yourself better, and be certain in your ability to tell the patients how to follow up. In most cases, Rest goes hand in hand with good treatment."
Lt. Frelzor looks to Feldon.
Frelzor: "How long will they be out of action? I need them for this contract."
Feldon: "I'll let Saracia answer that."
*Hadru, you only need the mechanics skill to fix broken or rusted weapon parts. If you are proficient with the weapon, you know how to clean it.*

Saracia looks at the sleeping Voren and the medical kit on Worokenâ€™s back. She knows Feldon meant well, but, she didnâ€™t like being talked to like a medical school student. She wants to say more, but, decides against it. â€œYouâ€™re right of course, Feldon.â€
Not wanting to step on Feldonâ€™s toes, Saracia faces Lt. Frelzor, â€œMost of the team should be available about 9-10 tomorrow morning after a good nightâ€™s sleep and a hearty breakfast. I havenâ€™t examined Awne or Rith, so, Feldon will have to answer for their condition and availiablility. Though, I have no idea, what this contract of yours entails.â€
She turns and looks up at Woroken, â€œI was thinking about getting a snack before bed. Woroken, would you care to join me? You have been patiently waiting to ask me some questions.â€
â€œUnless, you need me for anything else, Feldon.â€

Hadru watches Xander following his tutorial and notices the tool slide to his hand as if a magnet attracted it to his hand. Xander catches Hadru look of surprise, but the boy doesn't say anything. Shaking his head as if he just saw an illusion Hadru moves to take another drink of his water.
"I've been out in the twin suns too long."
Hadru continues following the simple instructions Xander had gave him. Learning a few extra tips from the skilled man, Hadru cleans his two weapons during this down time.
'Thanks for the tips Xander, I'm going to check on the others.'
After Hadru finishes cleaning his two weapons he moves to the kitchen to wash up and then heads to the Med Bay to see how his friends are doing.

Woroken nodded and followed Saracia to the kitchen area. "I don't mean to bother you while you eat, but I am just pleased to have someone to speak with again. There were two prior members that understood me, but one left, and the other was the body seen earlier today." Woroken said the last part of the sentence quietly for a wookiee. "But on a brighter topic, you are a very skilled healer. I do a little bit of field healing with medkits myself, but nothing like you do. If Lorhas is right, and I've got the Force, I want to learn to do that one day..."

Frelzor: "That's great, well I guess I want them to be in good health. You guys take it easy ok? I hope the local gang will choose to leave you alone over time."
The Lieutenant promptly leaves the room as Feldon checks over the patients that Saracia had treated.
Feldon: "Everything looks good, nice work for your first time in the field."
Feldon cleans up the surrounding area of the equipment that is no longer needed.
Feldon: "Do you guys have anything planned next?"

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 4)

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-26 02:22:38)

When Feldon asks about what we have planned next, Saracia responds with a slight smile, â€œGo get a snack. Have a little conversation. Then, to bed to rest up for tomorrow. I will stop by on my way back to my quarters. Want me to pick something up for youâ€
Saracia will await for Feldonâ€™s answer. Then, with Worokenâ€™s accompanying her, they head to the kitchen area.
With the mention of the death of one of his comrades, â€œMy condolences on the loss of your friend.â€
Saracia empathizes with Worokenâ€™s plight, â€œit must have been very lonely without anyone understanding you. I donâ€™t think, I would have had your fortitude. Among the travelers of my people, Wookiees have a great reputation as a noble, honorable, and trustworthy species. When it was revealed, I was to leave my people; the leaving committee required my learning Shyriiwook.â€
â€œI appreciate the compliment, but, I really played a small part. You were the healer. Ahhhhâ€¦â€ Saracia hesitates for a moment trying to figure out how to word something, â€œI better explain that better. If you took a few days rest, your body would have healed your wounds. All I did, was tell my body to tell your body exactly what to do and where to do it. Thereby, your bodyâ€™s natural healing process was speeded up. When I do this, your body doesnâ€™t like being told what to do. Instinctively, it tells my body, it knows better. This is why, you may have noticed ; I experience pain, when I heal. In time, I will learn to tell my body not to listen to the backtalk from my patientâ€™s body. Then, I will not feel the pain. It used to be worse, and I actually took the wounds on myself, when healing them. This can still occur, if I am not at my best.â€
â€œFrom your words, Lorhas hasnâ€™t explained the Force to you. Not surprising, since, its entirety is well beyond anybodyâ€™s comprehension. Everything has the Force, and the Force is everything. The Qiraash simply consider the Force, as life. The Jedi will explain the force as energy that surrounds, permeates, and bind everything to everything else. Others even call it magic. And those who donâ€™t even believe the Force exists, call it by various names: Luck, coincidence, gut feeling, premonition, just to name a few.â€
â€œItâ€™s really like a symbiotic relationship. Sometimes, you do things for the Force and sometimes the Force does things for you.â€
â€œAs a medic, you know, there are all sort of bacteria in your body to help with your digestion. In return, when you eat, you are feeding your pet bacteria. The Force is like this process quite a bit. Its there, but, most people really donâ€™t think about it.â€
â€œSo, since everything has or is part of the Force, you definitely have it. Lorhas meant, he sensed in you a natural talent for being able to listen to the Force and learn to ask it to do things for you. You could look at this, like giving yourself an antibiotic to help/tell your body to fight some infection.â€
â€œIf you wish, I could check, if I sense the same thing. I havenâ€™t, because, my species consider it rude to check without permission or a pressing need. Or, we can do a Force exercise game. I prefer the later, for you will be able to prove it to yourself, because, you will see it with your own eyes.â€

Woroken bade good evening to the healer., thinking what a different spin she put on her healing abilities than the wookiee had originally considered. "What a talent," he thought, as he grabbed an empty bed to get some rest.

Hadru grabs a bunch of snacks, bottles of water, and some fruit for Awne. He stuffs his mouth full and starts chewing as he leaves down the corridor. Hadru passes the Qiraash and Woro on his way to the Med Bay, hes holding a bunch of packets of food and balancing bottles as he walks past them, he greets them with an nod of his head, but doesn't stop to talk because he is chewing on something, but you can hear him say 'Hellwoo'. As he walks down to the Med Bay dust follows his footsteps, he dumps all the snacks and puts the bottles on to an open table. With a kiddish smile he offers the goodies.
'I brought snacks'
Hadru hops up on an open bed and opens another packet of food, he seems to enjoy the perks of free food. He addresses Vor'en, Rith, and Awne,
'I know we just got back, and you look like you've just wrestled a nest of Gundarks, but would anyone like to fill me in on what exactly happen back there? Starting with the part when you were captured and who they were.'
Hadru bites into a new piece of fruit and waits.

In the Med Bay, she sees one from last night. He takes the water to Feldon and does a quick check on the sleeping Voren. Going over to the Hadru, â€œIt was very kind of you, to think of your friends and bring them snacks. But, they need their rest and you should get some too. Donâ€™t worry. Feldon will have them feeling â€˜Right, as rainâ€™ in the morning. And, that is saying something, on this planet.â€
She has a short conversation with Feldon, before bidding him, â€œGood Nightâ€. Then, goes to lay down in the open bunks, Feldon told her about. She enters a Force Trance to take care of her the wounds, she recieve a few hours earlier.

Woroken ambles into the kitchen at right around 8 am, nods at Hadru who flashed by him. He was still half asleep, as he sat down next to the Qiraash, rubbing his large paws across his eyes. "Morning..." he mumbled, grabbing a piece of fruit, and looking around for something more substantial, clearly showing the affects of the last several days. While he wasn't hurt, he was just tired. "You wanna try that game you mentioned last night after you eat something? That sounded really interesting."

â€œIâ€™ll be right back. Got to go get the pieces for the game.â€, Saracia responds, as she gets up from the table. She heads over to where the fruit is and picks up two round fruits about the size of an orange. She returns and hands one of the fruits to Woroken.
Retaking her seat across from Woroken, she rolls the fruit from one hand to the other. She firmly grasps the fruit to stop it from rolling. Then, she rolls it back to the original hand. She repeats the pattern, letting it go to and fro. â€œWoroken, I want you to roll your fruit back and forth, like I am." She continues rolling the fruit, as Woroken starts rolling his.
She continues rolling her fruit, when she starts talking to Woroken. â€œI attempted to give some definition to the Force, last night. Imagination is the key to the Force. It is a lot easier to teach the force to a toddler than an adult. A child hasnâ€™t learned something is impossible. You have many years of experience, which tells you, that some things canâ€™t be done. For example, you could pick me up and carry me without any trouble. But, your experience tells you, I would not be able to carry you.â€
â€œSo, I need to do something, that you would normally not think could happen. Once, you see it is possible, then, you can believe, you can learn to do it, yourself. Belief in the possibility is the first requirement in using the Force. It doesnâ€™t matter, if you think itâ€™s a trick or someone is hiding something from you to do it. You know, that it can be done. How really doesnâ€™t matter, at this point.â€
â€œNow, as you roll your fruit back and forth, pay attention to the feelings, as the fruit leaves and reaches each hand.â€
â€œKeep rolling. Any questions, so far?â€

The wookiee was busy rolling the fruit around in his hands. "Fruits leaving and reaching my hands, huh? I can do that," he thought to himself. The wookiee had recently begun to believe, seeing Master Lorhas in action and seeing the healing powers of the Force. He also had not forgot the apparently Lorhas and Awne were able to communicate without words, only with their minds. "Leaving and reaching...leaving and reaching...." It took him a bit, but he finally got the movement down. While trying to maintain his focus, he snuck a peek to observe the Quiraash.
"I'm rolling, Saracia. I think I have the hang of it. What happens next?"

Saracia and Woroken are enjoying a conversation in the mess hall, when Saracia's ears pick up something. She can hear a conversation outside of the dining facility faintly.
Mur Eva: "Master, what is this about?"
Lorhas: "We have much to discuss; about Rith, Rast, and the rest of the group. We must do so in the briefing room."
Saracia can no longer hear the voices as they walk down the hallway, she had a feeling the Jedi wanted to keep this information low profile. But it sounded like they were going to discuss matters about the people she just met. They would be in the briefing room talking more, she might want to know more.

Saracia has no idea, who Rast is. But, from what she has seen, this group risks their lives for each other. Only Woroken has somewhat accepted her. But, Saracia knew, she was meant to be part of this group. The Force had welled up inside of her to burst forth to heal Woroken and Voren, even though, her normal abilities would have taken care of it.
She had to find out more. Unfortunately, that meant Worokenâ€™s training would have to be suspended abruptly. But, a few seconds would not hurt. Saracia feels the Force surrounding Worokenâ€™s fruit. When it is halfway between them, she exerts the Force to make it take an abrupt 90 degree turn, so, it rolls directly toward her. When it is near the edge of the table, she has it reverse course directly back towards Woroken. When it nears the edge of the table, instead of rolling off and dropping, It goes straight up in the air. Finally, hovering at Worokenâ€™s eye level.
Saracia stands up, â€œI am sorry to break this game up, but, we are needed at the briefing room. Grab your fruit.â€ Saracia waits for Woroken to grab his fruit before letting go of it, through the Force.
â€œLetâ€™s go. I do have a couple of questions for you. Did Lorhas mention anyone else in your group, as having the Force? And, who is Rast?â€ Saracia waits for Woroken to stand up, before starting toward the briefing room. Hopefully, she is accompanied by Woroken.

Awne stretches out with both the Force and her feelings, she remembers back to the days of her martial arts training to track down targets. It's not long before her senses lead her into the hallways of the embassy, she walks past the mess hall and the briefing room. She takes a left at a T-section hallway, and through a sliding durasteel door. She walks into a small room, immediately she notices a command console on her left. There seems to be 3 energy cages to her right that resemble small cells. A stranger is in the first one, and Rith is at the far end.

Rith: "Well, Feldon said that I had some kind of condition, in my affinity with the Force. He said he had never seen anything like it, and he is willing to bet it is the source of my memory loss. It could also be the factor in my wild mood swings. He doesn't know for sure though. I felt since the pending assault and sabotage investigation, it was best to just sit here. I don't even know who I'm turning into anymore. I mean, what would you do when a bunch of unexplained things happened internally when you felt you were losing control?

The young boy was sleeping in a chair in Med Bay when Awne got up, but her movments didn't seem to wake him. He stayed in the chair all night waiting for his friends to wake up. You notice bottles of water, packets of food, and some fruit that the boy must have brought to you before you went to bed. Sprawled out on the chair Hadru looks very uncomfortable, and you wonder why he would sleep in the Med Bay chair rather than a nice bed in the visitor's quarters. His arms are off to the sides of the chair, his head leaned back up supported by the wall, and his legs are keeping him from sliding off the chair, he occasionally snores lightly. An empty snack packet and bottle of water are on the floor near his feet, and you notice more bottles of water, fruit, and snack packs are on a nearby table. Vor'en's voice wakes him up.
'Hey Vor'en, Your up! How are you feeling? I came by last night, but everyone was sleeping. I figured they must have given you a sedative to help you sleep through the night. Here I brought you these, and some for the others, but it looks like they are gone already.'

The wookiee was amazed by the display. He grabbed his fruit, and stared at it. "I have got to learn the Force," he thought.
Woro stands up to join Saracia. "I have heard Lorhas say that our group is a strange one, as everyone has a bit of affinity with the Force. He has told us this numerous times, as he tells us to stay together. Then we always separate and get in trouble," at this the wookiee chuckles. "Rast is a friend of Lorhas that the Jedi are looking for. Our group met him a couple weeks ago, and he went missing. It appears he is hiding on Tatooine. The Jedi are looking for him." While Woroken likes Saracia, he did not want to go too far into the explanation of Rast. Yet.

Saracia listens to the Worokenâ€™s answer and mentally processes the information. The medical scanners showed everything normal, while the patient gets worse. Patient is force sensitive. Patient describes a void growing inside him. Is he being cut off from the force?
â€œThe Jedi are gathering to discuss your group, in secret And, there is some urgency about it. You, guys werenâ€™t invited. So, we are going sneak up to the door and ease-drop.â€ Saracia puts her finger up to her mouth in the universal sign of Shhhhh. Then, she makes her way up to the door. Knowing the Jedi would be alerted to any overt force use, passive use of the Force is the best course of action. Saracia opens herself up to be â€˜toldâ€™ by the Force, what it wants her to know. Because, thatâ€™s how she found out about this meeting, anyway.

**Knowing they are about to be caught,** Saracia opens the door and looks inside, â€œThere you are Feldon. I was looking for you to discuss a possible diagnosis on Rith. Woroken just informed me, that, he is Force Sensitive. With the scanners not picking up any abnormalities and his description of what he feels. I am guessing, a Force Illness. Though, they are astronomically rare. My people have not know of any for over a millennia and they are almost considered a myth. This diagnosis is based on very limited data an d no personal evaluation.â€
â€œIf the Force illness is cutting Rith from the Force, that would explain his sense of a void growing inside him and trouble with memory. What are your ideas on this?â€
Saracia thinks quickly on her feet to have an additional arguments or possible diagnoses for Rithâ€™s condition. And, just in case, they try to kick her out; a reason they have to include her in the discussion.

Knowing she is being dismissed by Feldon; she looks at Lorhas, â€œOne quick question. I have been instructing Woroken on the basics of the Force. I donâ€™t want to step on your toes, doing this. But, I was explaining to him, that no secret can be hidden well enough, that the Force canâ€™t lead someone to find. For it listens and talks to us; sometimes getting us into or out of trouble. For example, Jedi would may told to destroy bad omens â€¦â€, looking over to Mur Eva. â€œâ€¦ and invite in good omens.â€ Then, she smiles and winks at Lorhas.
â€œSo, one should be very careful to only try to hide, what the force wants hidden. For it doesnâ€™t matter, if they are where the secret is or in another room far away, they will know it.â€ Pulling out a chair from the table, â€œSo, do you want to invite us in? Or for us to learn about it in Med Bay? For, I may know a lot more about the current situation, than you might imagine or know.â€

â€œYes, you would have invited me, if you thought I was needed here.â€, Saracia states matter-of-factly. â€œI invited myself in, to prevent being caught sneaking outside.â€
â€œI want you to succeed in your mission, whatever it may be. For it may tangentially affect my mission. My mission Is to prevent war and destruction coming to my home planet. I know, my place is to keep this group alive. They or people, they affect, will cause events to happen. Their success can prevent my home planet being destroyed, minimize a war, or even prevent a war. The future is always hard to see.â€
â€œRemember, this group is force sensitive, not Jedi. Like myself, their curiosity can get the better of them.â€

Once outside of the briefing room with the door close. â€œWoroken, I am sorry for surprising, you like that. I should have warned you , instead of, suddenly opening up the door and walking in. Let me explain why and what happened. Though the Force, I was able to easedrop. We were about to be caught, so, I decided to face it head on. The conversation may have been a bit confusing, because, I was letting them know, what I heard. And, gave a bit of a warning to them, to be a bit more careful.â€
â€œ Additionally, Force users have some of their own slang, words, and meanings. Lorhas was severely scolding me. You probably caught the scolding for my rudely interrupting the meeting. But, there was a more subtle and severe scolding through specifically chosen words. The Jedi see the force, as having two sides: a light or good side, and a dark or evil side. Lorhas words of: â€˜forget our goodnessâ€™; was scolding me and at the same time from being deceived by the dark side or the Force.â€
â€œWe, Qiraash, are real homebodies. Most prefer to stay on our home worlds. Most who leave, are doing it, because, the Force tells them to. They are free to not leave. If they donâ€™t the Force has something like contingency plans. And lets other know, they may need to go. Your group is a focal point to the future. Its purpose, I am not privy. But, I do know my mission. Keep you guys alive. I fear, your groupâ€™s ability to find trouble and survive, is simply training you for even more dangerous assignment.â€
â€œNow, there are some force users, that could be on another planet and look into the meeting room through the Force, as it they were standing there. I have not been trained in that area. I am trained in the Force. And, I only have a microscopic understanding of its full power. So, what I can show you is very limited. But, then again, the Jedi will be able to show you another very limited amount of the Forceâ€™s true potential.â€
â€œWoroken, shall we go to the Med Bay to check on your friends? We can continue the game and training there. That way, all of you can learn the little, I know, about the Force.â€

It sounds like everyone in our group could use some tutoring from you, as you have a much more advanced knowledge of the Force than any in our group do."

As they walk together to the Med Bay, Saracia talks with Woroken, â€œLet me explain the second part of the game, which will be the most fun and exasperating part for you. You are going to roll the fruit without touching it!â€
â€œUsing the Force is more of an art, than a science. You will have to find your own way or style with it. All I can do, is show you the Force exists, an example of what is possible, and suggest imagery to you on how to ask the Force to do things.â€
â€œIn your life, you have learned quite a bit. You know rules on how the world works, such as gravity. While they have served you in the past, they do not apply as much to the Force. Letâ€™s look at what you did with the fruit in the mess hall. You thought to make your arms apply a Force to the fruit, to make it roll to your other hand. One way to move the fruit would be to imagine the Force, as an extra set of arms. And, all you do is have those imaginary arms roll the fruit back and forth between them.â€
â€œSounds simple, doesnâ€™t it? This is why children learn the Force easier, than adult. Your brain is going to say there is no such thing as imaginary arms and they definitely canâ€™t make the fruit roll. That is where your battle lies and the basics of the game start. You have to convince yourself:f there are imaginary arms and they are just ,as good as, your real arms. These imaginary arms are the Force. And, you have to believe the Force exists to ask it to do anything.â€
â€œKids have great imaginations. They can have what adults would call imaginary friends. Though, that is another matter. Did you had an imaginary friend, when you were a child? Remember back to that time, and ask your friend move or rule the fruit.â€
â€œEveryone can learn a lot about the Force, if they only paid attention to kids. At times, kids can use the Force, almost subconsciously or by instinct. Take a kid playing with a bunch of blocks. He wants a particular block, thatâ€™s behind him. So, without looking, the kid reaches back. But, the block is just a little out of his reach. He doesnâ€™t know that. He thinks the block is where he is reaching. So, the force moves it to his reach. Even if his parents were watching him, they might discount the block moving. Thinking they imagined it or they didnâ€™t see a finger touching the block drawing it closer.â€
â€œAnother way, would be to use gravity. You know, the fruit would roll down a surface tilted at an angle. So, you could imagine the fruit is on a piece of glass on the table. Then, you see the sheet of glass tilt to make it roll. By imagining the glass tilted at different angles, you can make the fruit roll, where you want.â€
â€œAll three of these examples can work or be total failures. One may work for me, while another works for you. You have to find out, what type of imagery works for you. You will fail a lot more than you succeed in the beginning. So, donâ€™t get frustrated, because, there is an emotional component to the Force. Remember when you were a kid and trying something new. Your mother or father would keep encouraging you, saying â€˜You can do it.â€™. In a small way, they were helping you do it. The Force likes to be subtle. Your parents wanting you to succeed may have gotten the Force to give you just a little boost.â€
The finally arrive at the Med Bay. Seeing Voren heading out the door, she says in a mock authoritative and jesting tone, â€œVoren, trying to sneak out without permission? Are you thinking, I would keep you here, longer than necessary. Just so I can look at you in bed and wish, you were sharing it with me. Must be a tough burden to bear, with every woman wanting you. While it may be true, I am a professional. If you got a nightâ€™s sleep, you can go.â€

All the examples Saracia threw at Woro temporarily struck him dumb. He repeated as much as he could remember to himself. Then one of the methods jumped out at him. He, like most children, had an imaginary friend. When there was some down time, he would begin the training again, this time doing as the Qiraash suggested, using his "imaginary friend."
Saracia seemed to be at home in the med bay. As she questioned the crusty old soldier, her temperment changed from the kindly teacher she had shown Woroken, to the assertive professional who while flirting, got her message about his recovery across with ease.
While the coversation with Vor'en was occuring, the wookie quietly ducked away, went to the kitchen and grabbed another fruit. He had always been fascinated with the Jedi, and if he could begin to understnad the Force, that would surely impress Lorhas.

Awne nods her head, seeming to debate on actually leaving before walking out of the room and heading to get food, hoping they had fruit. Once arriving at the Caf. she looks around and spots fruit. She purrs happily and grabs a few different fruits along with a drink and a few vegetable that as always she sniffs first. Once her arms are full she walks out of the caf and makes her way to the med bay poking her head in.

Saracia notices Woroken excusing himself. Probably, wants to practice in private. I did tell him not to get frustrated and the rest of his group would probably wonder, what he was doing.
Saracia sees Xander and Hadru in the Med Bay, She is about to introduce herself, when she sees Awne poke her head in. â€œLooks like, there has been a coup in the Med Bay. Considering all the patients were getting up on their own and leaving. â€œ
Looking over at the Farghul, â€œAwne, I am glad to see you are feeling much better. I know, these two were part of the group last night, but, I didnâ€™t catch their names. Would you mind introducing us?â€

Awne's eyes move to the woman, it was a nice gesture to pull a table over..that didn't mean the woman was on her good side in the least but..it was a very nice gesture. Her eyes narrow on the woman then relax and looks her over again. Setting down the food there would give her reason to stay but..Rith was all by himself..what was a farghul to do. *'Stay with frriends…eat with human…stay with frriends…eat with human..'* was running through her mind, she wished Rith was there with them..then again there was the taking them to him..

From last night, Saracia knew, Awne may be a little testy. But, she was a person of action and this behavior was completely out of character. If she was right about a force illness, they may have isolated him, to prevent any of the others from getting it. She looks around the Med Bay and doesnâ€™t see a missing bed. Unless, they have something already set up, that couldnâ€™t be it. Otherwise, one of these beds would be missing. Guess, I was wrong and Feldon just wanted me to leave the meeting.
Maybe, they had a spat or she is just worried about Rith. I donâ€™t know, her well enough to ask and after last night, she may literally take my head off. So, Saracia starts peeling the fruit, she still had from teaching Woroken. When she is finished, she HOLDS OUT the fruit meat to Awne, â€œEat! Otherwise, you will be no good for anyone.â€
Then, SARACIA picks up one of FRUITS from AWNE'S ARMS WITH HER FREE HAND AND PLACES IT ON the table IN FRONT OF AWNE. IF AWNE DOES NOT SHOW ANY OBJECTION, SARACIA CONTINUES TAKING ONE ITEM FROM HER ARMS UNTIL THEY ARE ALL ON THE TABLE.

Saracia takes a close look at Awne's mannerisms, Saracia would guess that Awne is not in the best of moods because of her affection towards Rith. You would even bet that the long day and being away from her close companion has made her grumpy. Furthermore, knowing the behavior of Farghuls, female farghuls tend to be jealous of other females in their social groups. This is especially true in a male dominant group. All of these factors coupled together led Saracia to believe it might be difficult to get on her good side.
*Outstanding use of the Knowledge: Social sciences btw.*

Awne looks at the fruit suspiciously, sure she had watched the woman peel it but she didn't know where it came from or how she got it...eatting it would be an act of trust to the woman and really...she didn't trust her yet. She shakes her head at the woman and deciding it would be better to protect her packmates from this intruding female she moves to Xanders side and sits, placing the fruit with skin beside them and passing out the rest, only after her men had some of the pile of food and drink did she pass a few pieces to the woman. After all she was *trying* to be polite.

When Awne shakes her head, Saracia withdraws the fruit. Saracia watches her actions watches Awneâ€™s actions carefully, evaluating the social implications.
When Awne offers a piece of fruit to Saracia, â€˜She is trying to be nice to meâ€™, Saracia thinks to herself. Saracia thinks carefully on her next action. While she wants to be courteous, she does not want to appear submissive, aggressive, or competition. She looks at the section of fruit laid out by Awne, and breaks the fruit in her hands to equivalent size. Saracia picks up the proffered fruit section and in its place, leaves a section of her own fruit in its place.
Saracia is not sure, if she should wait for Awne to eat before her or not. So, Saracia decides to fall to a general principle of any culture: Respect begets respect. Saracia makes sure Awne sees her, while she can observe Awneâ€™s reaction. She eats Awneâ€™s proffered fruit first. After the first bite, â€œAwne, this is delicious. Thank You.â€ She finishes Awneâ€™s fruit.
Then, Saracia starts eating her part of the fruit, of which she offered the other part to Awne. â€œHmmm. I have got to say; they donâ€™t skimp on the food, you can get at this embassy.â€ It was a mild non-threatening challenge, to see, if Awne would reciprocate.

Awne was watching the woman closely, at the offering of fruits and the eatting of the one offered to her first she couldn't help but smirk and chuckle, she waits for the woman to take a bite of her own fruit and waits for her to fall over from poison or some such.
When there is no outward appearence of a threat, she hums and takes up the offered fruit, sniffing it before taking a small bite, watching the woman. Seeing no hostile expresions she deems the fruit safe and eats it, then eats her own half, looking to the men to make sure they were eating.

Saracia smiles inwardly to herself after watching Awneâ€™s actions and thinking â€˜Awne probably expected me to sniff the fruit, even though, I donâ€™t have her heightened senses. â€˜ Saracia guesses, she didnâ€™t make any great faux pax. But, Saracia is pleased with herself. They definitely arenâ€™t at a friendly stage, but, better yet, it doesnâ€™t seem they are enemies. Saracia could deal with stranger status.
Having noticed Awne checking on Hadru and Xander eating, Saracia figured she would want the other members taken care of. Keeping her informed about the members, would be a good tact to take with Awne. â€œThank you very much for the fruit, Awne. It was the perfect desert for breakfast. Woroken and I met in the mess hall earlier for breakfast. We had a very nice conversation about the Force. And, I started to show him a Force game. Woroken left a little before you arrived. And I made sure Voren was well and had a nights sleep. Voren left with Lt. Frelzor.â€

Awne nods her head to the woman, finding it rather funny how she was trying her hardest to get on her good side, but at the same time, found it admirably the lengths she was willing to go to. She gives the woman a curious look at the wookiee and a game "Forrce game?" She had presumed the old soldier to be well enough if he had left the med bay and, as she was informed, speaking to Frelzor.

Hadru enjoys the fresh fruit Awne brought, he gives her a nod and smile of approval after biting into one of the more juicy pieces. Sitting silently Hadru watches the two females exchange words, using them like swords parrying and thrusting at each others ego. Hadru felt protected by Awne, but he wasn't picking sides. He didn't dare get between the two, instead he sat quietly until he couldn't stand the awkwardness any longer.
'Force Game? I ask Lorhas about the Force and he game me a ridiculous answer. I can't understand how a simple question, What is the Force? Could be so complicated to answer.'
Hadru looks at Saracia waiting to see maybe what she had to say on the matter.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 4)

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-30 11:10:56)

Saracia sees one of the problems, her people considered where the Jedi were misguided, They only wanted to start teaching children, only. â€œWhat is the Force? Itâ€™s a very simple question, but, very difficult to answer. The Old Jedi Order generally described it as: An energy that surrounds, permeates, and binds us. Sort of like the air around me. We all know itâ€™s there, but, we canâ€™t see it.â€
â€œThere are many Force Traditions. They each have their own way of describing the Force and some contradict another tradition in some small detail. The Qiraash believe, it is a very personal thing and each person has to create their own relationship with the Force. We can try to give a very general definition to it, but, no one knows the full extent of the Force. The Force is also given many different names: The Baran Do call it, The Guiding Ancestors. The Jedi believe the Force has two parts: a Light or good side, and a Dark or evil side. Some refer it to an all-knowing and all powerful god, which you ask favors from. Some even call it, Magic. The Qiraash simply consider it Life and their environment.â€
â€œSo, Hadru, your question was basically asking him to explain the life, universe and everything. *(hehe)*.â€ Saracia gives a brief pause, so, they can take in, what she has said.
â€œNow, everyone uses the Force, at times, throughout their life. Youâ€™ve all done it; You just didnâ€™t know it. There are different levels of use by different names: luck, natural talent, gut feeling, just to name a few. Lorhas takes a special interest in all of you, because, you are Force Sensitive. All this means is you have a natural talent to learn to use and listen to the Force.â€
â€œSince, the Qiraash consider it personal relationship, I can show you the Force exists and give suggestions on how to view the Force to use it. But, in the end, you have to find what works for you. In the beginning, all it matters is you know it can be done. It does not matter, if you believe whole heartedly in the Force or think itâ€™s some sort of trick. Though, the former means you will probably be more successful. The Jedi may or may not have a way of teaching about the Force, that will work better for you, than my instruction.â€
â€œUsing the Force has two basics to it. The first is simply to believe, something is possible. You donâ€™t need to know exactly how it works, just that it can be done. The second is imagining, what you want done.â€
â€œAwne, Hadru, you both asked about the Force Game, I was teaching Woroken. Itâ€™s a fairly simple game to show the Force exists and you can use it. After you have learned the basics, you can add rules to make it more difficult. At the beginning level, we pick a small object and make it move. For you to know, I didnâ€™t set this up ahead of time, I will use a piece of Awneâ€™s fruit. If you donâ€™t mind.â€, Saracia ask,s rhetorically . Saracia points to a particular fruit on the table in front of Awne. Reaching through the Force, she makes it move through an obstacle course of the other food and water bottles on the table.
â€œOf course, this is a bit above the basic game. The first part of the game, is just to get it to roll. Then, you add making it roll to different places. Once, you have that down. One learns to defy gravity.â€, the fruit goes straight up in the air and hovers about eye level of those gathered. â€œThen, you combine them allâ€ The fruit moves towards Saracia and goes around her head. The two males would probably not think, the orange going around their head a threat. But, Awne might. It may be risky to have the fruit circle Awne, first. With Awneâ€™s protective and nurturing nature, its probably better her first before her charges.
After it finishes circling Saraciaâ€™s head, it starts moving back towards Awne. Saracia makes sure it doesnâ€™t it get too close, to be considered a threat. It starts to circle Awneâ€™s head. And, if she doesnâ€™t object, the fruit goes and circles Hadruâ€™s head, then, to Xander. After this display, the fruit goes back over the tray and slowly descends to where it was original.

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 4)

### **zerah** (2008-04-30 11:46:49)

Awne listens intently to the explination of the force, at least this was easier to understand somewhat. When the fruit moves around the table her eyes watch it intently, when it rises so does her head to keep watch on it and when it circles her own head she trys to keep it in sight; her ears perked and tail twitching as it moves, muscles bunching when it starts to move around Xander and Hadru ready to slice it with her claws if it tried anything.
Even as intent as she was in watching it she still was able to mumble "so...that's how those plates moved afterr the crrash.." Her next words are directed to the woman as her gaze rests on another fruit still stationary, holding her hand at it, wondering if she could get it to move. "Can you use the Forrce to hearr people? talk frrom mind to mind, ah..telepathy I believe. Orr use it to find someone?"

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-30 14:28:14)

As Saracia moves the fruit around, she notices Awneâ€™s wariness of the piece of fruit. Subtle nervous ticks give away Awneâ€™s emotions and betray her being on guard. Saracia takes no offense to this, considering Awneâ€™s culture and her recent circumstances. Saracia takes a bit of guilty pleasure, seeing Awne evaluate how much of a threat the fruit is and expecting it to turn on her. Saracia had a bit of an idea, how strong and capable this woman was. And, Saracia knows, she doesnâ€™t want to get on her bad side, for it would be no contest.
Though, curious about the Awneâ€™s comments under her breath, Saracia just files them in her mind. *Curiosity killed the cat, works in general. But, in this case, curiosity could get the cat to kill me!*, goes through Saraciaâ€™s mind, so, she doesnâ€™t ask about it.
Saracia knew Farghul females considered other females competition, especially, with males around. But, Saracia got a healthier respect and understanding of its depth; when she noticed Awneâ€™s claws extend, as the fruit headed for Hadru. *I am starting to really like this woman. I may be starting to get a better understanding of her and her culture. Her protectiveness is not that much different, than how I am protective of my patients. I must remember to take her actions, like I would, if someone was interfering in my treatment of my patients.*
Not wanting them to be distacted by the fruit, Saracia waits until she returns the fruit to its starting position, before answering the questions. Saracia answers Awneâ€™s questions, simply, â€œYes, telepathy is one of the basic uses of the force. I use it every week to let my family know, I am alright. And, they are on another planet, quite a distance from here.â€
â€œAnd, Yes, you can use the force to find things or people. Itâ€™s easier to find things or people, that are force sensitive, though. Sort of like, you would notice a beacon in the dark. While a lit candle at the same distance may be overlooked.â€
â€œLet me give a more detailed explanation of telepathy, since, that was your first question. Telepathy is like talking mind to mind. But, it is not mind reading. You can say something to someone elseâ€™s mind using the Force. The closer you are, the more you can say. Itâ€™s quite similar to normal talking, in that, you whisper to someone close to you, talk in a normal tone in normal conversation, and yell to someone a distance from you. And, you canâ€™t keep up yelling, as long as, you talking in normal voice.â€
â€œNow, there is an emotional component to the Force and it is evident in telepathy. The Force knows whom you trust. For example, right now, it is easier for me to use telepathy to talk to Woroken, than the rest of you, with Awne being the hardest. The explanation is fairly simple; right now, Woroken accepts me, more than Awne. And, it will be easier for Woroken, Hadru, Voren, and Xander to contact Awne through telepathy, than Awne to contact them. Iâ€™ve noticed, Awne is protective of you guys. So, she pays more attention to what you are doing, than you paying attention to her. In essence, she is always listening, waiting for you to say something to her.â€
â€œLet me give you an example of telepathy, which almost everyone has experienced or heard talk about. Most cultures have stories about â€˜Mother Hearingâ€™, or something similar. A child scraps its knee outside, just enough to hurt. But, not painful enough for them to yell out in pain or cry. Just then, the mother decides to look out the window to check on her child. This happens all the time and people make jokes about it. But, in reality, this is the force helping out. Because, a mother is always looking out for and listening for any signs of distress in her child, she is more open to these feelings.â€
â€œWhen you were a child and scraped you knee, your mother probably did the *Kiss it and make it feel better*. And, her kiss on your hurt, did make you feel better. This was the Force at work. The only difference, between the kiss and what I do, is I have more experience and know how to ask the Force to do more.
Knowing Awne may take great offense to Saracia, just calling to Woroken; Saracia decide to ask for permission. â€œAwne, I can give you some proof, Telepathy is possible. Woroken is interested in learning about the Force and playing the Force Game. I could call to him, asking him to come here. If you donâ€™t mind. And when he gets here, you can ask: why he came.â€

They are a capable bunch, however they need guidance to gain their max effectiveness. I know you all were almost captured by the gang, but you managed to fight your way out. I'll admit that adding you to this expeditionary force may have been a better move than I expected, but I need a leader of these people you work with. Though your pay and status doesn't reflect it yet, I need you to step up and be a sergeant. I understand that all the members in your group don't fall under military command or even operative command, but you do, and it's up to you to utilize whatever assets you can to get the job done now. That being said, your resources must be protected, and I don't expect another blunder like that again...to be captured by any hostile force. Actions like that are simply unacceptable."
Frelzor takes a moment to sip his caf.
Frelzor: "I'm not saying your friends are expendable assets, they are strong companions that you must watch out for. Don't let your friends become compromised again, I'm charging you that duty as an experienced operative. The expeditionary force lacks formalized discipline education, we must learn it faster than anyone else in the field. It is a part of the risk you take, but you are a former stormtrooper, you only know mission accomplishment.

When Awne mentioned using telepathy and meditation, Saracia gets really excited and pleased. A broad smile breaks out on Saraciaâ€™s face. Saracia observes Awne sectioning the fruit and passing it out. When one is placed toward her, she hesitates a second before reaching for it. â€œAwne, I do not want to be rude. So, I should ask you: by your culture, am I supposed to wait for the men to bite into their fruit before biting into mine? Or, is there some time frame, I should wait before it is considered polite for me to eat the fruit?â€ Saracia will follow any of Awneâ€™s cultural instructions.
Saracia waits for Awne to finish talking, before responding with an self-evident glee in her voice, â€œGood. You have already been using the Force, without calling it the Force. Did you know, you could still talk to your father, that way? The only thing preventing it; is you thinking it is too great of a distance. Also, you know how much rested and better you felt after meditating? You can expand on that to help cure yourself and go with less sleep. In a large part, my healing is kind of me telling your body to go into a meditation and rest and repair itself very quickly. That probably is why you felt my healing, so strongly, last night. Your body recognized it, but, from an outside source.â€

Thankfully, they werenâ€™t very insulting or you were gratuitous enough to forgive my ignorance. You are the first Farghul, Iâ€™ve met. I only know what I have read about them."

â€œYou mentioned poisoning and tampering of food. I suppose, smelling the food is also meant to check for this. I did not smell or wait for you to eat the fruit, you offered me.

After roughly an hour of practice, Woroken had not gotten to much more than bring really good as passing the fruit back and forth. He had tried to remember some of the hide and seek type games he played with his imaginary friend back home and apply those same tenets toward moving the fruit. So far, he had no success, but was determined to not give up. He stashed the fruit, and went to check on the rest of the group. He knew Saracia had not been completely accepted by the team, and he wanted to determine her status.
Woroken left his quiet spot and marched down the hall, looking for the team. He heard voices and laughter and saw the majority of the team was together.
"Hey Saracia, no luck so far. My imaginary friend wasn't of much help today. I will try again later." He nodded at the rest of the team.

Awne chuckles "The fourrth..." She grins "but you'rrre trrying and I suppose that's something." She chuckles again though there's a glint in her eye that was directed to the woman. It would seem that while she was being friendly that didn't mean she trusted the woman. She looks up at the wookiee and picks up a fruit from her pile, sniffing it before tossing it to him. She grins and speaks to him in slow Shyriiwook, her natural language making it easier to make the noises. When she finishes she grins proudly, her tail flicking in self-content.

Woroken stares at Awne in disbelief for a split second. "I have my own fruit, thank you," he says, pulling out the fruit he had been practicing with. "When did you get so good at shriwook? That is very impressive, Awne. I appreciate you attempting to learn the language. That is very thoughtful of you."

â€œDonâ€™t worry about it, Woroken. You left before, I could tell you some tricks that help people.â€ But, then , she hears Awne speak Shyriiwook. She listens and is amazed, that she can make the sounds.
Looking at Awne, â€œNow, arenâ€™t you one for surprises. First, I find out you have been using the Force, but, under another name. Then, you speak Shyriiwook. I can understand it, but, I havenâ€™t known of anyone, who could speak it. Besides a Wookiee, of course. I wish, I could do that.â€
Saracia gets another meal tray and returns, â€œAwne, if you remember your fatherâ€™s teachings, you may be able to explain some things in a different way, than I. That way, they will have two teaching methods to choose from. Whichever works for them to learn; how to use the Force.â€
â€œAwne, you have also used the Force before. Picking up how to the move the fruit, shouldnâ€™t be, as hard for you to pick up. Would you care to grab a fruit, place it on this empty tray , and try to move it through the force. Just let your imagination guide its movements.â€

Hadru takes the offered piece of fruit Awne handed him and he sniffs it using his weak human nose. He shrugs as if the smelling didn't enhance the taste, but he bites into the piece with the same amount of savory joy as he did before. Listening to Saracia explain of the force was overwhelming, but it was undeniable the things she and Feldon had done. To heal with just a touch was an amazing feat even his father could not perform as a doctor. Moving objects in the air seemed like some sort of trickery, and Hadru was skeptical and his head filled with doubt as he watched the spectacle. Even seeing these amazing things with his own eyes, Hadru was not a believer, yet. He was very interested in the fact that Saracia had mentioned the Jedi said he was sensitive to the force.
While Awne and Saracia were conversing, Hadru moves to area where he can practice. He grabs a piece of fruit and sits down placing the fruit in front of him on the floor. He is looking at the piece and nothing happens. He imagines the fruit to roll, but it doesn't. He puts his hands under his chin looking closer at the piece of fruit on the floor and squints his eyes, but still nothing. He seems to lose his patience after the third try. He tries to concentrate again, but it looks like he is going to pop a blood vessel in his head. His face gets really flush turning red and his teeth are clenched slightly grinding, then he raises his hands up placing his finger tips to his temples thinking that will help. Nothing happens. You can see Hadru get very frustrated very fast. He starts to imagine the fruit to exploded as if a grenade went off in the center of the fruit tearing it to pieces. He's looking at it intently, teeth clenched, body tense, face red and you notice his holding his breath.
A huge sigh of breath is released as he catches his breath and gets more frustrated, he goes into his routine again trying to make it explode.....

Woroken looked at the Quiraash and told of his recent attempt at 'the game.' "I thought about our last talk and the several different suggestions you made. Like most kids, I had an imaginary friend when I was younger, so I decided to use that approach. I used to play hide and seek and other games with my imaginary friend, so I wanted to take the basic ideas of those games and see if I could pull something from those games to h elp me move the fruit. I tried talking (in my head) to Waltanor, the name of my friend, and asking him to help move the fruit. I couldn't really connect with him today, though, and then I got frustrated. That clearly didn't help, either. "

He knew the force was real and had a basic idea of its workings He was still a little shocked to learn he could control it. He couldn't resist any longer. He imagines a hand reaching out and grabbing a piece of fruit and bringing it to him.

As Woroken speaks, he has Saraciaâ€™s complete and rapt attention. She repeats some key things, as he says them. â€œhide and seekâ€™, â€œWaltanorâ€. Saracia thinks for a few seconds and ,as time goes by, a smile grows on her face.
Saracia speaks with all seriousness, â€œWoroken, I should have realized, Waltanor would play hide and seek with you. There are many dangerous animals in the forest, below, the Wookiee tree cities. Hide and seek would have taught you some tricks to protect yourself. But, Waltanor has been hiding for many years now. Thatâ€™s why, you are having trouble finding him. He has had many years to find the perfect hiding place.â€
â€œLet me tell you a little secret. Imaginary friends are real. What other races call imaginary friends, we call them; force friends. The Qiraash believe force friends are ancestors or an ancestorâ€™s best friend, come back to help their descendents. When someone dies, they become part of the force and they come back, when needed. Qiraash talk to their force friends all their lives. I would bet, if you had a list of your ancestors and their closest friends, you would find Waltanor.â€
â€œWaltanor, probably is all the way on Kashyyyk. You have been calling all that way for your force friend. At your current level of understanding, it would take many tries to find him. So, I am going try to call him in, from his hiding place. He doesnâ€™t know me, so, he may stay hidden. But, I will try to find him and let him know you want to play, once again.â€
Taking Worokenâ€™s hand in hers, Saracia concentrates to learn Worokenâ€™s unique force signature *(Sense Force)*. Saracia opens her eyes and pats Worokenâ€™s hand. â€œLetâ€™s sit.â€ Saracia takes a seat on the floor. â€œI am going to try to find Waltanor or at least get him to come. I need you to pat my hand, when you see him. Because, he could come and hide from me, but, let you see him.â€
Saracia closes her eyes getting into a Force Trance to focus her energies at the task at hand. Once, focused, she mentally calls her force friend and tells her, that Woroken is missing his friend and we need to find him. She shares Worokenâ€™s force signature with Zula and then together they rush across the vast distances of space to Kashyyyk. There, they call out to Waltanor, that Woroken wants him to come out of hiding to play another game.
Saracia is in deep concentration. Her normally pale white skin gets a slight blush tint from her effort to find and get Waltanor come to play with Woroken.
*Using Foolâ€™s Luck and Force Point to get a UtF with Take 10 to have 29. Itâ€™s very important to Saracia for Waltanor to come and help Woroken learn about the Force.*

Awne frowns at the woman, growling softly under her breath. She didn't look like a master of the Force thing, only masters should teach others...after all it'd be dangerous for a student to teach another student in martial arts so it must be the same for the force thing....at least that was her thought. Training, she had been taught, should be done by a distingused and recognised master of the art. They've already made all the mistakes before and know how to correct them and how to make the mistakes safely again without hurting themselves or anyone again for teaching purposes. Having a master that was recognised brought pride to the master and student and able to say who taught them..an unknown was just that.
She frowns again and stands, not wanting to be in the room to see this, less she lose her temper. Her tail flicking behind her in supressed anger she leaves the room to head down the hall quietly searching for one of the jedi to ask about Rith..perferably Lorhas over the female. *'that woman just rrubs my furr the wrrong way..'* she thinks to herself.

Woroken takes a seat within arm's reach of Saracia. If he would have spoken, he would have admitted the idea that his imaginary friend was real and hiding on Kashyyyk from him would have seemed very far-fetched.
He did his best however, to focus in on what she was saying. He had seen amazing things happen through the Force in the last couple months...perhaps this would be no different. He thought back to the force game he had been playing just a few minutes ago, and tried to picture Waltanor, asking him to 'come out and play,' so to speak. He closed his eyes in deep concentration, keeping his hand near Saracia, in case Waltanor appeared to him.

Hadru sees Awne leave and he is fed up with this ridiculous display.
'I must be insane to think I can move things with my mind.' He says more to himself then to anyone else as he leaves the Medical Bay after Awne.
He knew nothing would happen, and as he suspected nothing did. He picked up the fruit on the floor brushed it off on his dusty clothing "cleaning" it and then took a bite, then moved to the door to follow Awne. He didn't ask if he could follow, but he just did what he wanted and nobody ever really noticed him anyway. Staying behind Awne choosing his steps carefully so that he could dodge any conversation that would lead to him having to leave. He was a curious kid and still let his curiosity drive his actions.

Saraciaâ€™s mind and her Force friend, Zula, are searching for Waltanor on Kashyyyk. If either finds someone elseâ€™s force friend; they ask, if they ask them to help find Waltanor. They explain to the other force friends, that Woroken and Waltanor have been playing a game of hide and seek for a very long time. Woroken does not remember, which one was hiding and which one was seeking. But, he misses and needs to get with his friend now.
Together, Saracia and Zula, hand out â€˜party invitationsâ€™ to all force friends, they meet and agree to help them find Waltanor. The â€˜party invitationsâ€™ are actually a combination of two force signatures, Worokenâ€™s and the Tantooine Med Bayâ€™s. But, they provide the same basic information. Since, people and places change over time, each signature gives something like a date for them. This is one of the reasons, one can recognize other known signatureâ€™s with sense force. Recognizing signatures from a long time ago, is sort of like, meeting someone at a high school reunion and saying, â€œArenâ€™t you â€¦â€. And since, it contains a place signature and a person signature, the recipient knows: who the party is for, and where the party is.

Saracia and Woroken work together to establish a connection with Waltanor. Woroken can feel the Force, although he does not understand the sensation that is coursing through his mind. It is as if everything in the galaxy started to make sense to him, but it was sliding from his grasp as he concentrated harder. He could sense Saracia's powerful entity in the Force, linking with other people. It's as if Woroken was walking in a dark room in his mind, and flickers of Force flames began popping up everywhere. The flames were gathering together in a large fire. Saracia had gathered others to find Waltanor. The powerful Force connection resonated through Woroken, and the power was invigorating, he felt he would soon get to Waltanor. The Wookiee just almost felt his voice as if he was next to him. The connection broke abruptly as you snapped back to the Embassy.

Saracia was putting quite a bit of effort into going deep into the Force, to get it to help Woroken recognize it. But, she was snapped back at the forcefulness of Lorhasâ€™s question. Though the words registered, it took her a second or two to readjust from being snapped back from Kashyyyk to Tantooine. The effort could be seen in a bit of tiredness evident in her face, as she opened her eyes.
Once back, she takes a few seconds, carefully picking words to explain it in the Jediâ€™s point of view of the force, as far as, she knew or understood. â€œWoroken told me, most of this group is sensitive. He was interested in learning about the Force, so, I obliged. I instructed them on how different traditions basically see the force. I explained a childâ€™s force game and let them play, so, they could start to believe it exist. Woroken was having trouble connecting to the Force. I was asking the Force to help him, when you queried me. Its not like, I have any patients or other current responsibilities, I would be neglecting spending my time this way.â€

Woroken snapped to, with the sensation of a door slamming in his face. His extremities were tingling from what the wookiee assumed was his first real connection with the Force. It was an amazing indescrible feeling. Thinking about the last few minutes, he almost didn't notice Lorhas calling to Saracia.
He shook himself back to his senses, and quickly uttered: "I'm sorry , master Lorhas. I asked Saracia about the Force, and we decided to play a Force game. I lost the sense of time, and I apologize for taking her away from her duties. She was only trying to help me. I accept the full blame."
Woro hoped Saracia would not get into trouble. She had led him back to Kashyyyk in her mind, and he had felt the presence of Waltanor before being snatched back by Lorhas. Surely she could help him try again some other time.

The Force can corrupt those who are not ready to understand its implications. The power you are blessed with can warp your mind, it takes great responsibility. Now I'll admit, I sense something special in this group, but we should be very cautious on teaching them the ways of the Force. I'm asking that you please not teach them anything else; I've chosen to watch over them until the instant the Jedi deem them acceptable to be educated.

Saracia listens carefully and respectfully to Lorhas. In response, she speaks matter-of-factly, as she relates the Jedi/Qiraash history, â€œDuring the Jedi/Sith wars, millennia ago, the Jedi mistook the Qiraash, as Sith. The Jedi attacked us and we rallied to repel the invaders. After a few months of fighting, we scored our first victory against the Jedi. There were many wounded Jedi from the battle, which the Qiraash tended. When they were healed, we offered them freedom, if they promised leave the planet in peace. If they gave their word, we gave their equipment and weapons back and told the way back to their comrades. Most thought it was some sort of Sith trick or they were trying to hide something on the planet. A wounded *Jedi Padawan* was freed and returned to the Jedi. He couldnâ€™t find his master living or listed dead. So, he returned to us unarmed and found we were tending his master. He discovered we were not Sith. And we learned the Jediâ€™s concept of light and dark force. He was able to create an understanding and peace between my people and the Jedi.â€
She rhetorically and respectfully states to Lorhas, with a hopeful tone evident in her voice,â€ If they could come up with a compromise, days after severe battle between them, could we do any less?â€
As her tone drifts into fondness, â€œMost children of most races have â€˜imaginary friendâ€™. If they were better versed in the force, they would know, they are comprised and sustained by the force. To this day, the slain Jedi from those battles return, as force friends to someof our children. We are taught to respect Jedi. Even though, some of your practices simply strike us strange or wrong from our vantage point, and vice versa.â€
Saracia addresses Lorhas as an equal with a respectful, but teaching tone, â€œNow, Jedi and Qiraash have vastly different traditions on the Force. Considering our normal day to day experiences, this is extremely normal development. The Jedi consider it a rare and unique gift or power. The teaching of its use should be guarded, less it be abused or corrupted. This is a great responsibility.â€
â€œQiraash are a Force Sensitive race, similar to the Miraluka. We are born this way and it comes naturally to us. Any three or four year old Qiraash would know a lot more than, what I am teaching them. As children, we learn about the force from other children, in addition to our teachers and parents. I am teaching adults, how to play childrenâ€™s games. Anything taught can be wrongly used. Oneâ€™s personality determines the use of the force and that can change over time.â€
â€œMost races teach not to unfairly use ones strengths or advantages unfairly over another. Any gift, strength, or advantage carries great responsibility. Woroken, like most Wookiees, has great strength, but, gently pats people to show his caring. It is his responsibility to use it wisely and not unfairly against another. The same for ,Awne and her claws. From my cultural perspective, there is no difference in teaching them about the Force.â€
â€œFor our compromise, I donâ€™t think it would be fair or kind of me to unilaterally withdraw my offer. But, from what I have observed, I would probably be considered a bit behind Mur Eva. I am willing to point this out to the others. I told them there are different force traditions and views. I will tell them, my tradition does respect yours. Though, each views some things in the other, as misguided or wrong. Then, I present my traditionâ€™s viewpoint. You can present the Jedi point of view. And you can have Mur Eva and/or Feldon add their views also, if you wish. Since, they are trained in the force also. Then, we will let them decide, whomâ€™s advice to follow. I will only teach those, whom decide to continue learning from me. The lessons will be taught only around those continuing with me. This would be a binding agreement, so, we should think about setting a time for the decision to be made.â€
â€œDo you think this compromise is reasonable? Or have any suggested additions or modifications? Before you answer, I want to point out some things â€ Saracia pauses a second and looks directly into Lorhasâ€™s eyes. â€œI mean no disrespect, but, I need you to seriously think about some points, I am about to make.â€
â€œLorhas, we agree this group was brought together for a purpose. We may disagree or not even know what that purpose is. But, didnâ€™t you start this entire problem? You are the one, who made them aware they were Force Sensitive. Didnâ€™t you think, they would be curious and want explanations. Whether from you, others, or simple queries on various computer networks? You could have easily said, you saw some potential in them, that the Jedi could hone. And would they like the opportunity to be tested to see, if they qualify for specialized Jedi training. They would have been ignorant about the Force and their Sensitivity to it. Was it your mistake in judgment or the Force directing you to let this slip out?â€
â€œTo a point, you telling them about being Force Sensitive, is: showing a child a piece of candy, teasing the child by holding it just out of their reach, and telling them they canâ€™t have it. And, you are asking me to do the same thing. Offer to help them understand and then take it away. Thatâ€™s why, I want it to be their decision.â€
Saracia becomes silent and will respectfully wait, until Lorhas has time to digest and think about what she has said. She won't speak until he responds.

Lorhas nods to all of Saracia's statements.
Lorhas: "You speak of kindness by not withdrawing your teachings, but yet you speak in a condescending manner when you say the Force let something slip out. While you make interesting conversation, you haven't been around the group as long as I have. A lot of them have already begun to use the Force, they simply didn't know what it is, I just told them what the Jedi label it as. The curiosity was there before I said anything, Awne had already begun to be enticed by her powers before I even said the word Force. Now that we know the curiosity was there before I had a say in it; we are here to guide it, as opposed to teaching undisciplined and emotional free traditions that you do. We had ask them to stay near us, we even have paid them to not leave this planet, in the precaution to not let their power go unchecked. The power is being checked, which is why I'm here to ask you to stop teaching them. You are in the service of the Republic as a medical technician, your duties do not involve training the Force. You either adhere solely to your duties, or work for someone else. You are tapping them into a power that transcends Wookiee strength or a Farghul's claws, it's a power limited only by your mind. Potentially, it can be unlimited power, and I'm asking you to leave them be. Teaching an unprepared mind the knowledge of the Force without responsibility can lead to great disaster."

Hadru discovers a variety of rooms as he walks through the Embassy, some he has already been too. He finds a communication room, a briefing room, the mess hall, armory, barracks, latrines, speeder lot, and a few rooms he cannot get in. Most of the soldiers in the area watch him cautiously, as Hadru is a young boy with no uniform.

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-04 23:21:32)

Saracia is a bit perturbed at the suggestion, she was condescending to the Force. â€œThere was a miscommunication between us. Whether it was my wording or your interpretation doesnâ€™t matter. Let me clarify, what I meant to convey. A central theme of our culture is: you can ask the Force to do things and the Force can ask you to do things, also. The Force may have wanted, you to let them know about their ability. The Force is unlimited power and knowledge. *Oneâ€™s use of the Force* is limited by that personâ€™s mind, belief, and to what the Force agrees. â€
â€œI have been respectful to your traditions, while not denying my traditions. I admitted to disagreements with some of its tenets. Though, some of my comments could have been considered a bit rude, they were meant to explain the way, I see and have interpreted things. But, you have determined my tradition is undisciplined, emotionally free, and without responsibility. While at the same time, giving yourself some moral superiority, by saying you chosen to be to be some benevolent shepherd to watch over and guide this group.â€ Saracia is definitely starting to dislike Lorhas and his superiority complex.
â€œYou have been disrespectful of my traditions. So, I will speak bluntly.â€
â€œYou ask me, if I could try to see things from your side and for us to come up with a resolution to this impasse. I offered a compromise and asked your thoughts on any addition or modifications. You did not offer changes to my compromise or a counter proposal of your own. But, instead, issue an ultimatum. You are basically demanding me to stop teaching or face the consequences. Your ultimatum has me wondering, if this republic is worth surviving. Do the Jedi serve the Republic or is the Republic a tool of the Jedi? You demand me not to teach or face the threat of loss of employment. And, the requirement for the Republicâ€™s employment is to be a slave and limit my freedom of speech. Maybe, its my ignorance, Is there a law or clause in the employment contract, that prevents me to express my culture?â€, Saracia asks rethorically, with her words dripping in sarcasm. â€œIf I do not give into the ultimatum, you will see : I am excommunicated and separated from this group, through ending my association with the Republic.â€
â€œYou have said, you believe the Force has brought this group together for some purpose. But, you automatically discount my addition to the group could be the forces will, to teach them or give them a choice between traditions.â€
â€œYou demand from me something, you would not follow yourself. If I told you, I thought: Mur Eva or Feldon were not ready or should be evaluated by the Qiraash, would you withdraw your teaching them? Or, if I issued a similar ultimatum to you: *You are in the service of the Jedi Order on an assigned mission, your duties do not include watching over this group. You either adhere solely to the assigned mission for the Jedi Council, or leave the Order.*â€, as she uses Lorhasâ€™s own words to show the absurdity of his ultimatum.
â€œYou have not said, what would be done ; if the Jedi Council decides, they are not acceptable to be educated. Are you going to lock them up or prevent anyone from teaching them? If the Jedi Council is the final arbiter of whom is to be trained in the Force, you should have every Miraluka and Qiraash tested. For they could be much more damage, than I can with this small group.â€
â€œI was willing to attempt a compromise. It appears, that you are not willing. You have taken on the mantle to watch over this group. How sure are you: It is the Forceâ€™s will and not your own, that I should not teach them?â€
â€œI have seen, you redirect a blaster shot, in defense. That action caused a death. Now, by your perspective, my teaching is a greater threat to the group than any blaster shot. So, you have no choice, but, to protect your wards.â€
Taking on an authoritative tone. â€œ*If you are sure*, the Force does not want me in teaching them: Draw your lightsaber and strike me down. â€œ
Saracia stares eye-to-eye with Lorhas. She leaves her arms straight down her sides, as he makes his decision.
*OOC: Reflex Defense: 0 (?) - since, Saracia isn't going to prevent her suggested action, to strike her down.*

" No sir there is nothing else. If you have need of me again please do not hesatate to call, thank you sir." Vor'en turns and leaves to office. Once out of the office he heads for the armory. He pulls out his commlink, sets it for Anwe's comm. "Anwe could you meet me at the armory? I have somethings I need to talk to you about. Oh, and bring Rith and Woro with you please."
Vor'en thinks back to what it was like to have to lead troopes when he was in the Remenat. It was easier then, they where all trained soldiers they didn't question orders they knew what there job was and got it done. *"This will not be easy.

Lorhas: "Perhaps I shouldn't of judged your entire tradition's tendencies by your own actions. The fact remains, no matter what you tell me, you were teaching the power of the Force to people you haven't known for hardly a day. What is even more disturbing, is that you don't sense their emotional turmoil, Awne is twisted right now for her feelings to Rith. How do you know she wouldn't use the Force to be consumed by revenge if something were to happen to Rith? What guarantee do you have that this stranger won't later use that power to destroy all of us? Did you know that Feldon told me of a serious mental condition that Rith possesses? That he is having mood swings, and for that reason he locked himself in an energy cage? You don't think his attachment to Awne won't give him any knowledge of the Force that you taught her?"
Saracia notices that Feldon and Mur Eva have walked up to their master's side, probably trying to learn something. Nevertheless, the Jedi Master continues to speak.
Lorhas: "Rith himself is also under investigation for a sabotage and attempted murder. Yet you want to teach Awne this great power? When these two are very close? They may use this power later against us, considering I might be the one to arrest Rith. And the obvious thing you aren't understanding is that you don't know any of them, yet you want to teach them such a great power that could doom us all. If you were that intent on training them, couldn't you at least wait a while? You jumped right into something, which tells me you aren't respecting the power of the Force. With great power comes great responsibility, have you seen their responsibility tested? Or are you just that attuned to the Force where you can see their whole lives until their demise? Not even the great Jedi/Sith of the old have accomplished that feat."
Mur Eva seems to be growing increasingly impatient as her master speaks. Feldon watches her closely, as if he can anticipate her moves.
Lorhas: "I'm issuing this ultimatum because I don't believe you are seeing the danger of training complete strangers, and you're making it sound as if there is no way you will defer. If that offends your freedom of speech or your beliefs, I am sorry. I have to do what I believe is right for the safety of others. It may seem cruel not to educate people on using the Force, but essentially, without discipline, you are providing them the means to use a powerful weapon. You may not know this, but it is a Jedi's duty to identify those strong with the Force, and have them brought to Master Skywalker. So I am right on track with my duties, although that is not my primary mission, it is still one of mission parameters. Nowhere does it state for a Medic to train people in the Force. If I was shot then I'd trust you or Feldon to heal me, just like if a Force-user needed to be trained to be a Jedi, I'd trust us to handle that. Yes I am asking to take control of this group, and I'm peacefully asking you to withdraw your teachings. I believe to be trained in the Force you must first have trained your emotions, which I don't think you are sensing within them. I found this group first, if I could gather every Qiraash and Miraluka to be trained, I would. It can be quite difficult to convince a planet to become Jedi Knights, would do wonders on their economy."
Lorhas: "In reference to your statement on our the deaths we caused during the rescue, you didn't sense their hostile intent as we did. They had multiple weapons and were going to attack us to the death. We had sensed that, and we were doing it for your safety."
The Jedi Master extends his hands, completely away from his lightsaber.
Lorhas: "I don't believe the Will of the Force calls for murder, though you feel you must die for your belief. I won't even think of striking you, I just want you to stop teaching the people we met first."
Mur Eva has her hand rest firmly on her lightsaber as her master speaks.

Rith frowns in his energy cage, seemingly reluctant to stay in there any longer.
Rith: "Yes, better to go on without me. I'll see you when you get back."
A gleaming white protocol droid frantically clanks his feet to attend the desk Vor'en just approached.
Droid: "Oh sorry sir, we just had a shift change, what do you need?"
The armory seems to be the same as always, with weapon racks and armor racks stacked parallel to each other to the end of the room. There are storage crates at the wall where the racks end.

She pauses and walks backward as she passes one room, looking in as she sees the three jedi and the woman she didn't care much for. She moves back a little more past the door and calls woro on his comlink "Worro go meet Vorr'en in the Armorry I'l meet you therre."

## Re: Heart Of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 4)

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-06 02:45:57)

Saracia perceives Awne, but, has no problem with Awne hearing, what she had to say.
Saracia smiles at Lorhasâ€™s last statement, â€œI wouldnâ€™t expect to be struck down by a Jedi. If I was doing something against the law, a Jedi would arrest me. At the same time, issuing ultimatums is not the Jedi way, as far as, I know about the old order. I understood, the Jedi would work toward compromise, especially, when the intent to find agreement was shown by the other party. If you had struck me down, the group would have found out: you were not true Jedi. In a way, it was a test of you. Yes, I could have died. But, Iâ€™ve died before.â€
â€œMaster Lorhas, â€œ Saracia turns her attention to the female Jedi, â€œJedi Padawan Mur Eva, I owe you an apology. I used my raceâ€™s definition of Padawan, even though, I am aware of the Jedi definition. I assume, this Master Skywalker is a member of your Jedi Council. Your Jedi Council is about the closest equivalent of our level of padawan. A central tenet of our force tradition states: Any death or harm you cause, takes you from understanding the force. To translate my comment to your vernacular: How do you ever expect to become a member of the Jedi Council, when you caused a needless death. The is one of the greatest commonality between the Jedi and the Qiraash. At the time, I considered the death, as needless. I was just taken by surprise, by the redirected blaster bolt. Just like my blaster can do lethal damage, I keep it set to stun to minimize any harm. I thought, Jedi always altered the energy, when they redirected shots to do stun damage. I am sorry for any offense, I gave.â€
â€œBoth of our traditions understand that sometimes death is necessary, we should minimize those circumstances. Every child knows the following and I believe. the Jedi know it or something similar:â€
â€œDo not hurt, when holding is enough;
Do not harm, when hurting is enough;
Do not maim, when harming is enough;
Do not kill, when maiming is enough;
The greatest warrior does not need to kill.â€ *
After apologizing, Saracia returns her attention to Lorhas. â€œWe are going to have many conflicts between our traditions, but, that is natural. As a Jedi, you consider Force Sensitivity as a extremely rare gift and power. And the survival of the Jedi Order, is based on finding Force Sensitives. The Qiraash believes everyone uses the force, the extent is the only difference. A mother kissing a childâ€™s scraped knee, to make it better: is using the force. So, we view the Force as you would consider people with eyes to see with. Both traditions respect the force, just in different ways. If you could refrain from saying, I am disrespecting the force, I would really appreciate it. It irks me.â€
â€œMy understanding, is Jedi believe to use the Force one should be calm. The Qiraash believe emotions are a gift from the Force. Certain emotions make certain powers easier to manifest, but, and exact opposite emotion can achieve the same result. There is an emotional component to interacting with the force.â€
â€œYou mentioned, Awneâ€™s emotional turmoil. If my mate was sick or believed to do something wrong, I would be in turmoil, also. I understand her feelings. The Qiraash simply accept, that some will use the Force properly and others will abuse it. It is the responsibility of those, properly using the force, to handle those abusing it. There have been fallen or turned Jedi in the past. Though, it is a rare occurance. So, the Jedi Councilâ€™s determination does not prevent the danger, you think my training could cause.â€
â€œEven though, it is one of your missions to find Force Sensitives and take them to be evaluated. You have every right to try to convince them. But, you have no right to compel them. You have no right to take control of this group and it is not within my ability to give control of the group. Each of them possesses free will to decide, which they want to do.â€
â€œI have a solution, both of us can agree to and respect each otherâ€™s Force traditions. Itâ€™s more of a truce with a compromise coming later. We both will meditate to find the Forceâ€™s will about this matter. If the Force tells me; I should stop teaching, I will. Or, it should give you the arguments, you need, to convince me, to stop teaching. Not knowing, what our respective mission will require. I suggest, we aim for a meeting in the morning two days from now. And, hopefully, we both get time to meditate on the matter and come with a solution tomorrow morning. I get to give them a basic explanation of our conflict on this matter and we are going to meditate on the matter. If you agree to this, I will suspend teaching for the two days, until after we met to possibly solve this impasse.â€
â€œWould this be acceptable to you?â€

Mur Eva seems to rally behind Awne's outburst. She quickly draws her lightsaber, activating it next to Saracia's throat.
Mur Eva: "Since you don't understand that it's common damn sense that rookie's don't teach strangers something as powerful as the Force, I'll make it easy for you and spare the meditation. You back down or lose your head, since my master is too nice to handle you in a way you'll understand."
She glares at Saracia intently, as her lightsaber is jolted from her hand by the Force. Feldon catches the deactivated lightsaber.
Feldon: "That is not necessary sis!!!"
Mur Eva: "She doesn't understand the dangers Fel, she wants to train them just to say she can! Whereas we will train them to do greater goods!"
Lorhas: "Mur Eva, leave immediately."
Mur Eva: "Yes, master."
Mur Eva takes her lightsaber and leaves reluctantly.
Lorhas: "I'm deeply sorry Saracia, she will be thoroughly disciplined for that unneeded outburst. Awne, could you please go check on Rith?"
Lorhas turns to Saracia.
Lorhas: "You're right, they definitely have the freedom of choice. But I sense you only have been trained in the basics of the Force, I would rather pass them over to someone who has more experience. The Jedi have always done good for the galaxy, and I seek to send them down the same path if they are worthy. I would ask, for what reason do you want to train them? Why do you feel they need to be able to use the Force? If they become Jedi, they will seek to help others throughout the galaxy; solving planetary disputes, bringing peace, and possibly saving billions of lives. As far as I know about your culture, trained Qirraash keep to themselves. The Jedi seem better equipped to send people through a higher moral cause than learning knowledge for just themselves."

Mur Eva nods to Awne.
Mur Eva: "I believe that's the only way she'll learn the responsibility that comes with great power. Funny a non-Force trained can figure this out, but a trained one cannot."
Mur Eva walks toward the briefing room, and disappears from sight.
In the armory, the protocol droid rushes to retrieve the equipment.
Droid: "Sir, I'm afraid with your limited time in the Republic, you are only allowed certain equipment."
The droid passes out two power packs, datapad, blaster pistol *Tactics check*, utility belt, shoulder holster, identichip, desert tunic, and a blast vest of civilian design.
Droid: "Do you need anything else? I'll need your voiceprint for all these items if you don't mind, for accountability."
Vor'en notices a weapon that strikes his interest in the back. It appeared to be a large sword, forged from black durasteel. The weapon was huge, and as tall as a person. He doubted most people would have the strength to wield it. It doesn't seem like a weapon the Republic would use, due to it's high impracticality.

Once inside she moves to the counter "I need a new utility belt, prreferrably one in purrple if you have it, datapad would be nice, hip holsterr, powerr packs and..." she trails off, leaning against the counter as something shiny catches her eye. She points to the large sword "what is that and how do I get it?"

Saracia decides to wait until Awne finishes her outburst, before responding to it. But, she doesnâ€™t have a chance, because, Mur Evaâ€™s lightsaber is at her throat. Saracia is no fool and keeps quiet, while watching the interaction between the Jedi.
When Lorhas apologizes for Mur Evaâ€™s outburst, Saracia considers it safe to talk. â€œItâ€™s ok, Lorhas. No harm done. She decided to become to a Jedi and you decided to be her master. Whether she is disciplined or not for her actions, is an internal Jedi affair. It does not entail me, since, I am not versed well enough in Jedi traditions to judge fairly. But, the outburst does make me wonder. You warn me about teaching some basics to Awne, due to her volatility. I know, Mur Eva is well versed in the force, but, just as volatile.â€
â€œSpeaking of Awne, I should answer her comments, Lorhas. And, some of those answers, may answer some of your questions.â€, Saracia turns to Awne, â€œFirst, you were still being held, when the battle occurred. You did not see, what I saw. When I saw it, I thought the death was needless. I was apologizing to the Jedi, for I thought they modified redirected shots to stun only. A few seconds after the incident, Mur Eva explained her actions to me. Though, I regret the loss of life, in this case, it seems necessary. I never accused them of murder.â€
â€œAwne, you are right. You could probably learn more from her, than me. You attitudes towards life are similar. I on the other hand, preserve and nourish life and prevent from doing another harm. Woroken is another matter. Not only is he an experience soldier, but, he has also learned to treat the wounded. â€œ
â€œMaster is only a title. Sometimes, it denotes a level of competence and sometimes only someone more knowledgeable. A master may be great in his field, but, that does not make him a great teacher, and vice versa. And a master canâ€™t know everything and handle everything. Any master worth his title, learns from the students, they are teaching.â€
â€œChildren/students teach other children/students all the time. Hasnâ€™t one of your friends ever helped you understand homework or something. They may have understood the teacherâ€™s instructions, but, the way the teacher taught did not agree with you. That student may have been able to word it, where you understood. You could teach me things. But, I probably would not understand them without an interpreter, if you only instructed speaking Farghul. And, a student must be willing to listen to their teacher.â€
â€œAnd, if the Jedi Council deem you are not worthy and you want to learn about the Force. What are your choices? Learn it on your own or I may be you only other option. I do not claim to be a master, but, I am more knowledgeable than you. Would you choose to remain ignorant, since, you canâ€™t find a master?â€
â€œNow, we can discuss the teaching of the Force.â€, Saracia replies as she turns back to Lorhas. â€œWe have a fundamental different outlook on the force. You consider, what I am doing akin to: Giving a thermal detonator to a child and letting them play with it. I see it, that I am teaching a child, hide and seek, constables and criminals, or someother similar game. The lessons, they learn from the childhood game, may apply in adult life. The children grow up and have many teachers and ,in time, they become a military unit with a demolitions expert handling the thermal detonator.â€
â€œAs I have said, everyone uses the force, to what extent is the only difference. They were curious about it, ask questions, and I have just started answering their questions. They will need quite a bit of practice and teaching, to relearn things. I am not teaching them anything, I did not know as a child of four or five. â€œ
â€œAwne doesnâ€™t want me to train her. I respect her choice. But, for the purpose of an example, lets assume the rest of the group wanted me to train them. If Awne, Woroken, and myself were somewhere together and he asked me for instruction. I would suggest Woroken and myself go someplace private, to respect Awneâ€™s choice of not wanting to be instructed by me. But, on the other hand, if I was teaching the group and Awne came along. Even, if she does not respect me, I would expect her to respect the choices of her friends and not start disrupting the lessons.â€
â€œLorhas, you are a bit mistaken on Qiraash culture. Qiraash tend to stay on their own planets. Those that do leave the planet, do so to follow the Forceâ€™s will. They help solve disputes, cure injuries and all other manner of things. We are quite sociable. We do not learn things for just ourselves, but, for the Forceâ€™s will and its purpose for us.â€
â€œLorhas, no disrespect, but, you are putting your purpose above theirs. You want all Force Sensitives the Jedi Council deems worthy, to be trained and become Jedi. But, what if, they do not want to become Jedi, but, still are deemed worthy to be trained as Jedi by the council? And, what happens to those deemed unworthy? What happens to someone deemed worthy, trained, and then found to be unworthy?â€
â€œYou speak of grand things a trained Jedi would do. They have been trained for that and they may want to do that. But, take the person, who sees someone hungry and feeds them. Who is to say, which in the distant future did the greater good. Yes, at the time, the Jediâ€™s may seem to be the greater good. But, the great grandchild of the person fed may have a great destiny, which does greater good than the act that was applauded. While the man just fed someone.â€
â€œI was not willing to die, so, I could train them. I was willing to die, so, they had the free choice on how they were to be trained. They chose to ask questions. I chose to answer those questions. Some chose to listen. Some chose my instruction was not for them. The Qiraash tenets say, free will is the greatest gift from the Force. Also, the force can ask us to do something and we are free to accept, reject, postpone. Reasons for these choices very, but, for a rejection they may feel they are not ready for the task. The force told me, he would like me to leave in the future. I learned the healing arts. After a few years, the Force told me it was time to leave. I could have postponed this request, so, I could learn more of the healing arts. I chose to leave, when asked, instead. Even though, I would have preferred to know more healing arts.â€
â€œI understand, force healers are rare among the Jedi. Feldon sees me perform some Force Treatment technique, he does not know. I know, Feldon chose to become a Jedi. Though, I donâ€™t know, all the ins and outs of Jedi culture; I do know, he is a padawan and you are his master. Even though, I may be the only person able to train him the particular technique; I would approach you, Lorhas, for permission to teach it. I would be respecting his choice to become a Jedi and try to work within that framework. If you told me, No; then, I would not teach him. I may not like your decision. But, I must respect it, if I am to respect Feldonâ€™s choice to become a Jedi.â€
"Is the suggested meditation and truce, Ok with you, Lorhas?"
*OOC: I started writing this response before your last post, Awne. Hope the belated comments to Awne arenâ€™t a problem. Or I will edit my post, if you want. Where you left before I said this.*

Woroken ends up at the armory seeing most of the members of red team. He greets them all, and greets Awne in shriwook. He hadn't had much chance to talk to her lately, but wanted to make sure she kept up her mastery of the language. The wookie saw the attention of the group was focused on the large sword. He asked the worker at the armory if he could take a closer look at teh weapon.

Awne grins "good!" she laughs and claps the mando on the back as she turns to the wookiee, clearing her throat before answering him in her own greeting of his language. She wasn't perfect, it would take years for that but thankfully her farghul tounge allowed her to make the noises of the wookiee, though she was sure some she wouldn't be able to make. "How arre you Worro?" she says in basic.

"I can tell I am in the Military again. Would look at this. I could use a blaster rifle to you know." Vor'en looks over the little bit that the driod had given him. "Well I guess this is strandard issue." Vor'en eyes the sword in the back. "That seem alittle out of place back there. Can I take alook at that?" Vor'en looks over the gear while he waits for the driod to answer.
He turns to Xander. "If you want to join up you are more then welcomed to. As long as you follow mine or Awne orders frist time everytime, I don't see where there is a problem. Just be warned we have made some people here very unhappy with us." While waiting Vor'en give the driod what he needs to speed up getting his gear. Checking over the pistol he starts to tell Anwe why he called her down here. "I will have to assume that Rith is on the way. We are going to take the job for the mayor and complete it and then do what we can for the Jedi." " We are also to find anyone who wants to help out the New Republic and send them Felzor way." "We are to operate on the fringe of the Republic we are alittle bit better then hired mercs." Vor'en looks at both of them to see there reaction. "The NR will give us some support but we are mostly on our own. And for what ever reason Felzor wants me to lead you guys so no one is to leave on there own without the rest of the team." " I don't want a repeat of what just happened OK."

It was strange how she would jump at some for calling her human anything but others she let it slide. Still she turned to him and grins "He is an ass sometimes I'll give you that one, but he's getting betterr." She chuckles softly as she looks to ther hands on the counter "As forr why he's therre, he said it's because he doesn't know what's happening with him, that..Feldon said he has a condition and he losses contrrol...he doesn't even rrememberr the trransporrt and can't explain what happened with Rrad."

Thank the starrs forr it, not being in this thing saved my life when we got capturred."

Xander takes a close look at the enormous sword in the back of the Armory. It appears to be six foot in length, and the blade is roughly six inches in width. It is all black steel, but he can also tell it has some type of weave. As far as swordsmithing, this appears to be of an extremely high quality. Due to it's size, Xander estimates it would only be practical if you were mounted when you wield it. It looks like it would take huge amounts of strength to even swing it once. He doubts that even he could swing it.

"We will be heading out pretty soon so we can get Woro's spear and me some new clothes sence mine are alittle torn up." Vor'en looks at his commlink. " I will get this thing with Rith sorted also.

Rith steps through the door into the shop. Rith glances around at the party and his eyes latch onto the large sword held by xander. His memory suddenly flashes to a black suit of armor and an image of excessive training. "A dark Saber?" Rith steps over to xander and pulls the humongous blade from his hand at close examination the blade is nearly 10 inches in diameter and the blade alone is 6 feet in length. "I remember this blade well." The weight seemed familiar. Almost 180 pounds or 80 kilograms, even for Rith though without the suits augmentaion the blade was almost too much. Rith swung the sword and shattered the floor in one mighty swing. Taking several seconds to pick the blade back up from its nearly unmovable position. Rith looks back to the shopkeeper. "Where did you find this blade?" His eyes intent on learning the truth. Rith's memory though shallow was very vivid on this weapon. He remembered the weapon well. This was an imperial prototype weapon. "I was one of the few lucky enough to train with this blade." "Where did you find it?" His eyes now unblinking, staring directly at the shopkeeper.

The attention he drew from the guards didn't stop Hardu's curiosity of the embassy grounds. Snooping around was something of a game to Hadru, exploration was in his heart. His wanderlust brought him outside an open balcony where he could get a good view of the city. He acclimated to the hot dry air of Tatooine, moving his goggles down from his head to protect his eyes. His thoughts were sad as he thought about his home planet and the war he left behind. A dry gust of wind pushed against his face, but the hot suns made sure it was uncomfortable. He never thought he would celebrate his birthday alone on a desert planet far away from home, he is fifteen almost a man. He missed his brother, father and mother he had never known but he smiled when he thought about his new friends and a warm feeling overwhelmed him. Not the hot desert air, but a tingling feeling inside his heart that he has grown to feel more often with his newfound companions. He stands outside on the balcony for awhile enjoying the peaceful time alone, then moves inside the embassy to find the others.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" "Are you really going to fight over a bloody sword?" "All I did was look at it, you might want to consider your actions before you act upon them." Rith's stare tightens then he turns his focus to Voren. "I dont know what it is about the warm welcomes i receive from you people, but its getting old." "What makes you think i need to calm down, i have shown no anger... If anyone needs to calm down, its this trigger happy womprat over here." Rith shakes his head then turns to Awne. "Feldon and the lieutenant believe that my condition is well enough that i can come along on this mission, they believe that you will need my help so they are sending me along." Rith turns his focus back to the blade in his hands. "This is called a dark saber, it is a prototype weapon made by the empire." "It was used by dark troopers as an offensive weapon mainly designed to give an edge to troops against the jedi, but the empire fell before it could be fully put into production." "It is a very heavy weapon that can only truly be effectively wielded by the enhanced strength of a fully trained soldier in dark trooper armor." "I was one of the men chosen to test the sword, it is an awesome weapon in the hands of a suited dark trooper, sadly none of us will be able to wield it with the full potential of a dark trooper." "It is still a very deadly weapon, but the only ones of us who could wield it in battle would be me or woroken." "Even then after one swing me or woroken would take several seconds in combat to ready it for another attack again making it valuable in only certain situations."

Saracia is starting to see some similarities between the Empire and this Republic. So, she wants to find out more, to correct her misunderstandings. â€œLorhas, it seems we are not going to solve this disagreement, here and now. As you noted, my contract with the Republic does not include discussing the Force with you. So, I will take my leave and return to Med Bay.â€ Having said goodbye to the Jedi, Saracia turns and goes to Med Bay.
Upon her return, she sees the Med Bay empty. *I must not be needed for the meeting.*, she thinks to herself. So, she starts cleaning up and throwing peels and other used food in the trash. Any nutrients left, she puts off to the side. Once finished, she gets out her datapad and connects to the Embassyâ€™s network. She starts performing some basic information retrieval. In order, they are: 1) Rights of the individual, especially concerning cultural or religious rights, 2) Laws relating to the use or training about the Force, 3) the legal connections, power, responsibility between the Jedi and the Republc, 4) Jedi tenets, major sayings,culture, and responsibilities, and finally, 5) her contract.

While saying nothing, Woroken did not take his eyes from Rith while he was holding the weapon. The wookiee had never fully trusted him, and nothing he had seen in the last few minutes made him change that position. Woro was completely prepared to take that weapon from Rith, if it came down to it. Thankfully, things settled down on their own.
The wookiee looked to Xander and showed him his bowcaster, so he could determine exactly what pieces would be necessary for cleaning and maintaining the weapon. He patted Xander on the shoulder in a gesture of thanks.

Rith turns to everyone seeing how they ignored the threats and words said by Xander and how everyone seemed to target him with their aggressions. Rith turns back to Xander his eyes flaring the veins blood red with his anger. Rith straps the sword onto his back and walks out of the Armory. As he passes Rith whispers under his breath so only Xander can hear. "Watch your back fool, You have crossed the wrong man... your death will be long and painful i promise." With that Rith strolls out of the armory and waves his hand. "I'll remember this when you all need my help." "Damn all of you." "See if I will raise a hand." Rith leaves the armory and heads to the med bay hoping the find a doctor for some meds to calm his rage.
As Rith enters the Med bay he finds only Saracia, working diligently on the computer. His rage almost uncontrollable Rith looks to the woman and breathes a heavy breath, someone was going to pay she was as good as any. Rith lunges across the room and heaves the sword swinging with all his might at the woman.

Awne watches the human leave, a hurt look crossing her features. It stays for only a moment before she turns and bangs on the counter "hey! drroid!! how my belt coming?" she looks down, and sighs as she rests her arms on the counter, shifting her postition so she could aly her head on her arms, a rejected look in her eyes.

The protocol droid raises his hand at Rith.
Droid: "Sir! You cannot take that sword, you are not in the Republic! GUARDS!!!!"
An alarm begins blaring in the Embassy, after about thirty seconds, four Republic soldiers dressed in tan armor walk in. They appear to have blaster rifles at the ready.
Guard 1: "What's going on?"
Droid: "Thief! He's headed to the west wing!"
The four guards head out towards where Rith was walking.
Saracia hears Rith behind her and faces him. She sees that Rith is in an attack stance. He brings the mighty sword down and Saracia barely gets out of the way, as the sword falls, it cleaves her left arm and left leg clean off. They both can hear the sound of bone crunching and blood splattering. The blood sprays all over the computer console she was working on, covering the screen with red. The sheer weight of the sword and the shock of the pain knocks her straight into the ground. Saracia is no longer breathing, she is bleeding heavily on the Med Bay floor.

The sound of the alarm caused Hadru to make haste pulling out his slug pistol, he runs down the hallway to the last place he saw his friends; The Med Bay. He grabs his comlink on the way calling Vor'en.
'Where are you!?'

As Saracia sees and feels the sword slicing through her arm, instinctively her mind yells out to Woroken, â€œ**Help**â€. Before she realizes, what is happening, she sees the bed rise in her vision, as she passes out.

Rith looks down at the body, blood spilled out all over the console. His last breath of anger, Rith lifts his sword and with one last swing slams the blade down with all his might cleaving the unconscious body clean in two and shattering the floor beneath. His rage somewhat subsided and the room now drenched with blood Rith looks around now hearing the alarm since his mind is now coherent. Rith sheathes the massive blade and runs out of the room and heads to the nearest place no one would look.
*Perception +2 to find a good place to hide.*

He hears the alarms go off as Rith walks out with his sword. He draws his blaster and follows Woro out.
*shouldn't we have have some more chances to act before psycho gets to the medbay when he first steals the sword?*

Vor'en not liking the way Rith had looked when he walked in to the armory. Liked it even less when to of his men started argueing over a piece of metal. "Hey you too need to play nice. Rith, Xander does have a point you could have asked." As Rith threatens not to help them if they need it and turns and walks out of the room. The driod behind the counter screams for Rith to not leave with the sword. A minute later guards come running into the room then the kalaxan sounds and more guards going to in the direction of the med bay.
Vor'en grabs the rest of his gear and heads out the door following Xander and Anwe, Woro to the med bay. Apon reaching the bay Vor'en sees something he has only seen on the battlefield. A body cut to pieces laying on the floor and Rith standing over it covered in blood. Vor'en motions to Xander to give him his blaster rifle. Taking it and aiming it at Rith. "Son put the sword down now. I am only going to ask once Rith." Vor'en hopes that this will not end the way he knows it will. Rith was his friend, he trusted him with his life they had been though alot. Something was wrong and it needed to be fixed and fast.

Xander shrugs the rifle off his shoulder and lets Vor'en take it. He sees the carnage cause by Rith and sees Sarcia's body on the ground. He lets the anger flow through him as he raises his pistol. Time seems to slow as Vor'en shouts
"Son put the sword down now. I am only going to ask once Rith."
The blaster lines up with Rith and Xander smiles as he squeezes the trigger.

Red Team walks into the Med Bay and can only see Saracia's corpse laying on the ground. Blood was all over the floor and the computer console. The four Republic soldiers storm into the room, rifles at the ready.
Soldier 1: "EVERYONE PUT YOUR HANDS UP!"
Just then, the alarm pattern changes. A new alert goes across the sound system.
Voice: "WARNING!!! Two more Star Destroyers are now in orbit of Tatooine, Three Star Destroyers total are now closing distance towards the system."
The soldiers look at each other, highly alerted, and they seem scared.

Awne sighs and looks back at the body, she didn't like the woman but she didn't want her to die..well...maybe in her own head but not seriously. "Yea...I know..." She looks around as well, slowly trailing her eyes over the ground to see if he could be found.

Xander pulls out equipment from the medical bin and quickly but sloppily patches up the bleeding from Saracia's body. She appeared to be breathing, but unconscious. She was alive and there seemed to hope. Immediately after Xander saves her, Feldon storms into the room.
Feldon: "Mur Eva has been captured by an Imperial strike force at the outside of the Embassy! The shuttle is escaping!"
Beyond that, Rith seemed to be completely out of sight.

Meanwhile, on board the Star Destroyer *Thunderpoint*. An Imperial officer gazes down at Tatooine through the large bridge viewport. Another officer approaches him from the long bridge catwalk.
Captain: "Excuse me, Admiral Reyis?"
Reyis: "Yes Captain?"
Captain: "We've captured Lady Eva and we've calculated her time and distance to this ship. The shuttle will be safe if we attack the settlement now."
Reyis: "Hmm, does Lord Strife realize the repercussions of destroying a settlement controlled by the Hutts?"
Captain: "I believe so sir, he's offered to pay triple the settlement's worth in compensation."
Reyis: "Decent, but I hope Rast Drowen's death is worth that amount of money. Is he sure the Jedi have found Rast?"
Captain: "He's not sure, but he has detected a large amount of Force energy being used down there, it was several beings using it. It created a large enough flicker that led him believe they were in vicinity of Rast."
Reyis: "Well then, we just have to be in the vicinity of Rast to kill him with these weapons."
The admiral takes a moment to think, and then speaks with a commanding voice.
Admiral Reyis: "Commence orbital bombardment of Mos Esre!"
Captain: "Yes my lord!"
Within mere seconds, The three Star Destroyers unleash a hail of turbolaser and torpedo fire towards Mos Esre. The settlement, and everyone in it, is destroyed in a matter of minutes.
