# [Heart Of Shadows] Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-03 06:43:12)

Red Team slowly marches behind Hadru as he guides the unit along the small Jawa tracks. Everyone can feel the sweat drying against their bodies as it is cooling off slightly. The wind is gently whipping sand into everyone's faces. You walk over a few dunes to keep up with the tracks, and notice they are slightly starting to change direction back towards the settlement. Hadru estimates with his skill of tracking that the target was making a wide circle to make it back to Mos Esre, and he believes if he turns the group around he could head off the Jawa instead of chasing him. However, he could be wrong about this. Red Team needed to make a decision.

Awne breaths, looking out at the sand as she returns to her teachings to calm her nerves and clear her mind to determine the proper path. Cutting the Jawa off was the best idea, but if they were wrong...
*UtF +7 search feelings*

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-03 14:26:39)

Awne looks deep within her feelings, and she gets the notion that cutting the Jawa off will work.

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-03 15:04:05)

Awne opens her eyes and looks to the boy and Rith. "We head him off, lead on Hadrru, I'd like to trry to make this quick and get you two to get medical attention"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-03 15:12:08)

Awne also gets a feeling that running would expedite the process since you are no longer following his tracks, but you merely want to intercept the Jawa.

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-04 02:55:27)

*Awne's silence to Hadru's question may have been mistaken as a statement, but Hadru knew that it was a hunt. Hadru smiled, but it was hidden by his breath mask and scarf. Hadru nods in agreement with Awne's choice to take the risk.*
**Hadru obeys Awnes command**,"Yes Mylady."
*Hadru leads Awne and Rith, he gets a little excited and his heart starts to pump faster because he knows the hunt is on and the prey is close. Hadru moves a bit faster using his skill and instincts to guide them at a faster pace. Its obvious Hadru wants to find the Jawa as he quickens the pace.*
[OOC: Hadru picks up the pace to a normal speed, Survival with speed penalties. If Hadru feels he is losing the tracks, his instincts kick in UtF +3 Search your feelings.]

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 17:00:22)

*You are no longer following the tracks, you are attempting to cut the Jawa off as he circles back toward the settlement.*
Hadru ponders if this is the right course of action. He can get a vague sense that Awne is right, but he is not positive. The Team runs toward the east to head over some dunes. They begin to scramble up them as they can hear footsteps. All of you clamber over the top of the dunes and can see the Jawa immediately. It appears he is walking towards the settlement. He looks at you and stops in his tracks completely. *He is about ten squares away at the moment. It is now 4:50 pm. Hadru and Awne receive 100 experience for tracking the Jawa successfully.*
Rith stops and looks at the rest of the group, he has his scout blaster ready.
Rith: "I slept through Jawaese classes in my studies growing up, now what?"

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-04 18:12:02)

Awne looks at Rith and mumbles to him and the boy "set it to stun but don't firre yet.. Hadrru get rready to rrun afterr him he rruns frrom us.." She stands tall, slowly bringing her hands up to show she didn't have a weapon in hand, her tail flicks the sand around as she speaks louder "Tippet, We'd like a worrd."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 18:20:12)

Rith nods to Awne and looks back to the Jawa.
Rith: "But there is no fun in the stun setting."
Rith follows the group as they close distance on the Jawa. The Jawa waves to the group, but when Awne speaks to him, he simply holds out his empty hands. You can see a holster with a weapon in it.
Tippet: "Heebah una tanini!"
Tippet speaks in a very high tempo, and you doubt you could understand it even if you knew Jawaese.

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-04 18:31:52)

Awne hums looking at the Jawa, he was waving..and letting them get closer...What was it her father taught her..something about the eyes and body language and inner feelings...She focuses on her past training, to see if he was really actually friendly and a victim like they were.
She shakes her head as she focuses "I don't underrstand you, can you make..ah...hand motions?" she was trying her best to simulate the hand motions for speech.
*UtF +7*

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 18:39:28)

Awne doesn't get a good feeling about this particular Jawa, but it is something she can't explain.
Tippet watches Awne and then waves. He turns back towards the settlement and moves in that direction.

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-04 19:59:48)

*Hadru's heart is pumping he almost forgets to set his sporting blaster rifle to stun, it looks like he might have to shoot the Jawa if he runs, but Hadru waits for Awne to finish her diplomatic solution. Hadru keeps looking at Awne and Rith for the nod command to shoot.*
[OOC: guns set to stun have a range of 6? right? I can still shoot beyond 6 just at penalties? BTW, I'm off to work. I won't be able to post until 3am PST]

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 20:06:29)

*According to the Errata, stun has a maximum range of 6 squares, so I'd imagine that means the stun blast cannot go further than that.*

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-04 21:51:23)

Awne hums, keeping her face friendly though she mumbles to the others "I don't like the feel of him..be rready.."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 21:56:56)

Tippet pays no mind to Red Team as he just continues to walk towards the settlement.
*He is now five squares away.*

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-04 21:59:50)

Awne follows him "Tippet!" she then mimes as she talks "walk...with us...Republic." she draws the image she saw for the republic in the air.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 22:02:42)

Tippet gestures as if he was clueless, he then continues to walk.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-04 22:07:13)

"Tippet!" she mimes again, pointing to him, and then herself and the other two, walking and the republic symbol.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 22:08:32)

Tippet stops and then spins in the sand, he motions frantically.
Tippet: "Heee bawta hawh!"
The Jawa resumes his march towards Mos Esre, and Rith frowns at the situation.
Rith: "Well, I see that we have a language barrier. We can either force him to come with us or stay near him until we get a translator. Forcing him to do something may mean less info if he is innocent though."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-04 22:12:41)

"Bawta?" she glances to the others "the sands a bawta?" she growls and marches to him "Tippet, damnable thing we need you to come with us and get a damned trranslatorr so we can figurre out why it was you rran!"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 22:23:41)

The Jawa motions for everyone to go away, he then walks indifferently to all of your communication.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-04 22:30:35)

Awne growls and picks up her comlink "Feldon! I need a trranslatorr please tell me you speak Jawaese."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 01:16:36)

Xander has been watching the Jawa lead these people across the sand for several clicks from his shade spot near the gate to Mos Esra. He watches as the jawa tries to shoo them away. They seem to get more desperate the closer the jawa gets to town.
Xander yells out "I don't think he likes you very much."
Xander is siting on a crate in the shade. Wearing a all temp cloak over his armor like a poncho. His blaster rifle lays across his lap. His helmet sits next to him.
He is a young human with red hair and gree eyes. He looks maybe 16-17 standard years old.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 03:30:54)

Awne looks up at the voice "Hey! you speak his language?" The farghuls tail flicked in aggrivation, she was hot, annoyed, and had been shot at. her mood from earlier had not increased, rather it was going down.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-05 04:31:58)

*Hadru's was focusing was on the Jawa, when the man sitting on the crate spoke it startled him. Feeling a little jumpy Hadru turns his weapon quickly towards the voice. Hadru seems a little on edge, possibly because he angered the wrong Hutt. After the man speaks Hadru calms a bit, lowers his weapon in a non-threatening manner hoping the man will help with their small dilemma.*

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 09:24:32)

Xander takes a drink from his canteen. He sits up a bit straighter and says to the Jawa
*Jawa trade speak "These people would like to barter with you"*
*ooc:How many of you are there following this little guy? I read back throught the posts but couldn't tell.*

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 10:46:25)

Tippet motions toward Xander.
Tippet: "I'd like to sell them many things, but I fear those giant bandits might come back to shoot me! I have to get out of here. The giants of sand can meet later if they really want items."
Awne's comlink buzzes back as Feldon responds.
Feldon: "I'm busy treating Vor'en and Woro, can it wait?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 10:59:33)

Xander nods as he listens to the Jawa.
"Jawas are an incredibly timid race. He says he is scared of giant bandits. He says he will meet with you later if you want."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 11:19:08)

Awne looks at her comlink and answers much calmer then before "It's alrright..we found someone to help..sorrrry about yelling to you Feldon, arre they alrright?" She looks up at the boy at the spoke and frowns "He just wants to sell us things? He wasn't parrt of that attack? Why did he rrun, we could have prrotected him."
*there's 3 of us with the Jawa.*

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 11:41:35)

"He is a jawa they always run away. Maybe if you tell me what happened I can make more sense of what he is saying."
Xander gets off the crate and rests his rifle over his shoulder

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 12:00:15)

"We werre attacked. He.." Her tail points to the Jawa beside her "told us he had a shop of sorrts that he wasn't allowed to set up inside the city so we werre going to go to wherre he has set it up outside of the city when we werre attacked." She narrows her eyes at the Jawa a moment before looking up again "He took off just beforre they starrted shooting at us. Needless to say we thought he was parrt of it, and I want to know if he was."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 12:24:53)

percept +7 to see if jawa lies in his response

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 16:50:25)

Awne's comlink emits the Young Jedi's voice.
Feldon: "Yes, thank the Force that they had treatable blaster wounds. It appears they'll easily pull through after some bed rest. But you all need to head back once you are done out there."
The Jawa proclaims that all he wanted to do was sell them items. Xander has been in Mos Esre for some time, and he has realized that almost anyone is allowed to set up business in the settlement without prejudice. He has the nagging sense that the Jawa has been lying to the three people.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 17:26:30)

Xander wipes the sweat from his brow and looks the group over.
"Well I have been here working for the Falsoor company doing hostile speciman retrival. I havnt heard of any sentiant being banned from setting up a stall in town. He was most likely paid to lure you out of town."
He squats down eye level to the jawa.

*That's a persuasion intimidate check, do you want to do that? If so, post your persuasion skill.*

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 17:56:14)

Tippet seems visibly afraid as he backs up just a little.
Tippet: "No need for that! I was hired by fat slug's giants to give up these giants. Many giants in the town want these giants dead for big trade pieces."
*Xander gains 200 experience for discovering the true nature of the ambush.*

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 18:50:03)

Awne was livid, anyone could set up shop? what in the galaxy happened? She watchs the two speak to eachother, her tail curling on her ankle. 'Damn me...if I hadn't been so upset I could have atleast thought betterr..maybe prrevented this..' she berated inside of her head, aloud she addressed the human "What's he saying?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 18:55:25)

Xander stands and says.
"It seems that you made an enemy of the Hutt. He is the one who set your little surprise up. My hunt team met a gruseome fate trying to capture a Krayt dragon for that slimey worm. Ive been working solo since bringing in Tuskens for Falsoor. The area around here is being hunted thin though. Do you need any help my services are available if the price is right."
Xander slings his rifle over his shoulder and puts on his helmet. It has a mandalorian look to it.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 19:13:10)

Awne growls, at the Jawa and herself; she felt guilty. She grabs at the jawa so he couldn't escape and so they could bring him back with them to the embasy, Vor'en would love to have a chat with him I'm sure. She looks up at the human and hums, another hunter on the team would be nice. "Come with us..I'm surre we can worrk something out, but I'd like to get out of this damn heat and get these two.." she motions with her tail to Rith and Hadru "to the med bay."
*Grab = unarmed attack 1d20+4*

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 19:36:54)

Xander grabs her hand as she reaches for the Jawa.
*counter-grab +2*
"Hold on there kitten. I gave him my word that if he told me who hired him he was free to go. Its not like he had much choice anyway who's gonna tell a Hutt no on a world they control?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 19:58:48)

Awne reaches for Tippet as he backs up alarmed. Xander reaches to block Awne but she stops in her tracks. The Jawa seems definitely frightened.
Tippet: "Why do the giants fight amongst themselves? I thought you had problem with Tippet!"
Rith watches indifferently at the Jawa's rapid speech. He looks at the group, holstering his blaster.
Rith: "If we've angered Bordo, which is very likely considering all the evidence we've discovered, it'll be dangerous to explore the settlement anymore. We'll likely be baited into more traps if we aren't careful."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 20:03:38)

Awne frowns "a deal? hmph..fine, ask him then if he will come with us to the embassy....kitten?" she blinks at the term, unsure how to feel about that. Turning to Rith she nods "time we got a ship and left then...let's get back, Feldon would like to see us in the medbay I'm surre." she turns back to the human that tried to stop her "you will come with?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 20:07:43)

To Tippen
Xander grins
"I think its time I was moving on as well, this town is getting a little hotter than it should be on a world with two suns. So if the offer is still open I will join you."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 20:08:28)

Rith frowns at the current situation, he folds his arms waiting for the next member to speak up.
Rith: "Though it doesn't really bother me, we won't be in much position to help the Jedi here because we will be hunted down. It'll be hard to find that spy with Hutt's militia after us. Even if we do bust their chops everytime, they'll likely hire bounty hunters to do us in. They use more underhanded tactics and would probably kill us in our sleep. I know how these fringe types work, even though I can't remember my own past."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 20:12:12)

Awne nods "Then we leave. Lets get back and tell the otherrs and prreparre..we'll need to get a ship." She begins to walk in the direction of the embassy, glancing at the new member of Red Team as she passes him; her tail waving as she walks.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 20:13:24)

Rith looks to Xander.
Rith: "My name is Rith Bendar by the way, if you choose to get involved with us, I can't promise you monetary gain. The only thing I can promise is trouble. It seems we've angered a few people since we have arrived here. You sure you want to get him involved Awne?"
Rith begins trudging back to the Embassy at Awne's side.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 20:15:49)

Xander offers his gloved hand to Rith.
"Names Xander and trouble is usually profitable in one way or another. Did I hear you say you were working for Jedi. No wonder you attract trouble."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **zerah** (2008-03-05 20:17:39)

Awne turns as she walks and grins "He chooses himself to get involved; afterr all, he offerred!" She turns and continues walking, laughing lightly, another mind and opinion was good, another gun was better.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 20:18:30)

Rith shakes Xander's hand.
Rith: "Yes we are working for the Jedi. They may pay you for your efforts, I wouldn't want you to get involved in this with no hope of gain. Our situation here has gotten complex, but we can talk this out when we get to our makeshift base of operations."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 20:19:51)

Xander nods and follows the group as they wind through Mos Esra

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (The Hunt for Tippet)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 20:34:23)

*It is now 5:10 pm.*
The suns are near setting behind you as Red Team moves through the sand. The Jawa tags along reluctantly as each member awaits the refreshing breeze of the Embassy, and a cool drink.
You see some of the lighting begin to spring up beyond the adobe style buildings, past the Mos Esre walls. The few ships that are leaving orbit have their safety lights on. In the sky above, you see the Star Destroyer looming like a giant arbiter of fear.
You close toward the walls of Mos Esre and see the huge familiar tan archway. A speeder whizzes past you as the Republic guards wave to you. The main dusty street that you walk seems to be thinning out as time goes by. The group veers to the left from the Residential area to the crimson colored building of the Embassy. The guards flanking the doorway welcome you immediately and let you pass. The durasteel door hisses open as you feel the cool air blast your face. The group clanks across the metal-grated floor towards the medical bay, you walk in to see a grayish room with a very sterile feel to it. There are several medical beds embedded in the walls of this narrow but long room. The young Jedi Feldon has both of your comrades hooked to whirring machinery with tubes protruding from them.
