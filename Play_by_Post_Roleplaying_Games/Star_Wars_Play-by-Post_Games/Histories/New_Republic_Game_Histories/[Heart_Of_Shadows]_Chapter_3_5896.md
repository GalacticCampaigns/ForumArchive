# [Heart Of Shadows] Chapter 3

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-23 22:07:17)

Awne stands in the room as she can feel a soft breeze coming through her room window, it would seem the suns are on the rise quickly. She can hear chatter from the townfolk coming from outside. The Jedi Master had just left her with a surpising statement, that they had no choice but to meet with the Jedi.

### **zerah** (2008-01-23 22:10:50)

Awne blinks at the comlink *'no choice? strrange..'* She sighs, and leaves through the door, while she would have liked more sleep they needed to meet with the grandmother and then the Jedi. She walked to wear she believed Vor'en's room to be and enters after knocking once. She stands in the doorway and calls out to him "Vorr! time to get up!"

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-23 22:12:56)

Awne follows her strange feeling for a second, opening the door next to Vor'en's room. This is where Dexer and Radon were staying, they are both gone...The Jedi would not be happy with the group being seperated. She thought of Rith's room....

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-23 22:16:30)

"Gone.." She looks down the hall, and continues in a direction hoping to find Rith's room. Her heart pounding as she hopes against hope he was still there.
*Perception +6*

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-23 22:18:51)

Awne opens the door. The dark brown door hisses open.*Awne's perception 6+19=26*
His bed is empty, and there appears to be no one in the room at all.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-23 22:20:48)

"No..No!" Awne rushes from the room and down the stairs to the bar area, looking around franticly for the imperial she'd come to care for.
*Perception +6 again right?*

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-23 22:23:38)

*You don't need a perception for that.*
The Racer's Bend cantina had become lively as usual, with the typical gruff looking group partaking in some drinks. Rith stands at the bar in front of the bartender, the droid is no longer there, just an old out of shape human. He is drinking a reddish liquid that makes his face grimace.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-23 22:27:10)

Awne breathes a sigh of relief, leaning against the doorway for support as she grasps her heart. She moves after a moment with quick strides over to the human, her tail whipping furiously behind her. Upon reaching the human's side she promptly hits him over the back of the head with an open palm.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-23 22:32:56)

Rith pauses for a moment in shock, then a grim look comes over his face.
Rith: "It's good to see you, did you rest well? I noticed that Radon chose to tag along with us again. Is he upstairs?"
Rith takes another sip of his drink and offers one to Awne.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-23 22:36:12)

Awne couldn't help but smile, even if he did look grim. She takes a sniff at the drink first to see how strong it might before taking a sip. "He's not up therre..neitherr is Dex..and don't you scarre me like that!" she looks at him crossly "worrrried me when you werren't in yourr rroom, thought you might have..rrun off orr something." she looks at her glass and sighs.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-23 22:43:53)

Rith: "I wonder where they are, not that I'm worried about Radon. But he did help us out last night when we got into that firefight. He could have left us alone but he intervened, despite my attempts to try and kill him. Even when he must of felt alienated when he left the team. Regardless, the Jedi's were right, it is dangerous for us to be split up...Bordo's men are aware of last night's events. So, it would be in our best interest to keep a low profile. What's next on our agenda? I take it we are going to deliver the kids to Alus at the Embassy?"

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-23 22:46:11)

Awne nods her head "Yea, Need to get the otherrs up and get going. Think you can handle getting the kittens up and feeding them something while I get the otherrs?"

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-23 22:48:59)

Rith: "Yea, I'll get them something. We should eat after we deliver them to the embassy though. My stomach could hold more than a Sarlacc's right now."
*Rith's statement reminds Awne that she is hungry.*
Rith waves his hand for the bartender, asking for some food.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-23 22:51:36)

Awne grins, and pushes back from the bar and back up the stairs after a quick look back at the human. A small warm smile crosses her lips, before she dissapears up the stairs to wake the others.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **ganthet** (2008-01-24 01:14:22)

At the sound of Awne's vocie Vor'en wakes. "Let's get moving guys." "We have things to do today." Vor'en gets up and checks his eqiupment and heads down to the bar."Woroken if you and Ben want to take the rest of this stuff and sell it go a head." At the bar Vor'en orders a cup of caf. Vor'en then rembers the man they brought with them, picking up his comlink he calls Ben. "Ben cut him loose. He shouldn't be giving use any grief." Vor'en then puts his com link away and drinks his caf.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-24 01:38:02)

*That'll be 1 credit for the coffee Vor'en. But your thirst is quenched, now you just need a meal. Unless you guys have some container, carrying all that gear could be an encumbrance.*

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-24 01:41:24)

Awne smiles as she spies the old soldier leave the room. She makes her way to her room and opens the door looking in on the kids. She smiles and moves to the bedside "Time to wake up little kits, we've got something to eat forr you downstairrs and then we'll take you to yourr grrandmotherr."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-24 01:44:06)

The door slides open behind Awne and he has a steaming tray of warm food that tickles her nose.
Rith:" No need kids, just eat this up real quick and we'll go see grandma."
The kids eyes light up as they recover from their sleep.
Boy: "What's on the menu?"
Rith: "Dewback eggs, sandcakes, and juice."
Boy: "Ewwww...I hate those eggs.."
Rith: "Eat it boy, it's good for you!"

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-24 01:48:26)

Awne chuckles behind her hand, her tail waving happily as she watchs. She steps up next to Rith and helps him to pass out the food to the kids "Eat up kits!"

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-24 08:57:06)

Woroken arises after hearing Vor'en call his name. Woroken throws the remaining blaster rifles over his broad shoulders. "Ben, grab what you can carry, and let's go sell all this stuff. The rifles alone should bring a pretty penny. At the least, grab the blasters as they will bring a higher price than the other stuff."
Woro sticks his tongue out at the kids, eliciting laughter as they poke around at thier eggs. Woroken gestures to Awne and Rith that he and Ben were going to sell the excess equipment and would return shortly.

Ben picks up the equipement, feeling the burn mark on his chest stretch as he lifts it. He grunts a little in the pain but tries not to register how he feels on his face. Okay Woro, lets get rid of this trash.
*Gave myself the xp. Also Ben hasn't had any creds of his own this entire game. lol*

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-24 13:05:15)

Woroken saw Ben flinch as he bent over and grabbed teh equipment. He made a mental note to try again to bandage those wounds properly after they sold the epuipment. Themedkit would make his job easier.
Woro fell in line behind Ben and they both stepped outside into the market area, and headed toward a booth that might be interested in their wares.
*Perception +7 to find a booth that might traffic in weapons*

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **ganthet** (2008-01-24 13:45:20)

Vor'en drinks his caf and decides for food would be a good idea. He orders some breakfast, he finds a table and sets down and waits for his friends to show up with the kids in tow. Vor'en thinks back to when his life had changed. He was a Sargent in the Imperial Army, He commanded a squad of stromies that he had more less trained himself. Then the day one of his Commanding Oficers had order him and his squad to kill agroup of civilians, mostly women and childern.
He remebers what happened next. Truning to the Co. and refussing to follow the order. The smell of the mans breath as he yelled at him to open fire and then the sound of his E-11 going off and the man falling dead. He had never regeted his actions that day he was a soldier then and still now. Killing unarmed civilians was not his job. The eye patch is acontent reminder of what he did and the honor he felt when he did it. Of course he was arrested and was going to be exacuted untill he escaped and ran. But he saved some of them before the others opened fire.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-24 15:13:15)

Awne smiles at the wookiee as he poked his head into the room, nodding at him as he left. Concern flitting over her features at the sight of Ben, he really needed to be treated. She turns her attention back to the kids, leaning against Rith with a sigh as she watched the little ones finish breakfast; she was still a little sleepy and made a mental note to try to catch a nap later.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-24 18:43:39)

Awne and Rith serve the food from the tray to little kids. They eat every bit of it up. The kids crawl out of bed and start collecting their toys.
Boy: "Are we going to see grandma now?"
Rith looks up at Awne.
Rith: "When do you want to go? Oh, Woroken and Ben went to go sell some items huh. They need to be careful, Bordo's militia is alerted."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-24 19:01:42)

*Woroken's Perception Check 7+2=9.*
Woroken and Bennosuke walk outside admist the burning suns. It had not gotten quite as hot as usual, but it's still hotter than most places in the galaxy. The crowd of Tatooine locals were busy bustling about the shops that were about 55 meters away from the Bantha Tracks, in a open area away from the other buildings. You hear overhear some topics of conversation and everyone seems to be talking about the militia uproar or the charity podrace in two days. Ben points to the shops and they both make their way towards that direction. It seems people were either dealing in junk, clothing, or moisture vaporators. Woroken looked over the shoulders of people standing in the booths to see some indication that someone would buy weapons. He looks to his left and he spots a sign hanging over a booth in basic, "Hunting Goods", it read. Woroken thought this was the best option they had.1
Despite Tatooine being ferocious, it didn't seem weapons were being sold outright. Woroken stands in front of the booth, and sees a jawa standing there. He begins speaking Jawaese, and motions to a set of sporting blaster rifles on display on one of his tables. Woroken displays his weaponry, and the jawa looks stunned. He offers to pay in truguts. *Credits not being a very popular currency here. But truguts are accepted everywhere on Tatooine.* The jawa offers a trugut value that is 4700 in credit value, but the trugut pieces seem like a lot less credit chips. So truguts are worth more.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-24 20:08:09)

"4700 truguts, huh? Make it 5000, and you have a deal..." Woroken tells the Jawa.
*Persuasion +2*
Woroken nods to Ben, and mutters in shriwook, "We probably need to get back to the group as soon as possible. The Jedi is waiting, and we don't want to run into trouble, just you and I out here alone."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-24 22:00:17)

Awne looks up at the human and hums "We should get going as soon as Worro and Ben get back, I think Vorr is downstairrs, best get the grroup togetherr." She looks back to the boy and smiles brightly at him and his siblings "Yes we'rre going to see grrandmotherr verry soon, lets all go downstairrs and wait forr the big wookiee to get back alrright?"

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-24 23:21:17)

*Woroken's Persuasion Check(Haggle) 18+2=20. Make sure you are putting ur updated character sheets on the forum.*
The jawa takes a long look at the collection of weaponry. He then nods and hands over 5000 truguts. He happily puts his arms around the rifles and puts them behind the counter. Apparently, he doesn't want these items to be in plain sight for some reason. "Utini!", the jawa shouts frantically, he then waves good-bye.
Meanwhile, back at the Racer's Bend lodging, the kids gather up their toys and gather around Awne. They follow her obediently into the bar and await further instructions, seemingly distraught surrounded by ruffians.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-25 00:22:00)

Awne smiles soothingly at the kids, letting her tail wrap around a few beside her as she guides them to where she spots the old soldier "Hello Vorr."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **ganthet** (2008-01-25 01:17:37)

"Oh, hello darling." "Sorry I was just thinking." "Everyone ready to go, I see you have the littles ones in tow." Vor'en smiles at the childern realizing his appaerance is alittle scary. "As soon as the human blaster target and Woroken get back we are headed out." Vor'en stares off for a second looking alittle sad, and then he is snapped back to reality again. "Did you guys get something to eat?" "Set down and order something."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-25 01:26:48)

Awne ushers the little ones into chairs, and takes a seat beside the soldier, pulling out a chair and tugging on Rith's sleeve for him to sit. "Rrith and I haven't eatten, I'd rratherr wait until the little kits arre safe in theirr grrandmotherrs arrms."

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-25 07:03:32)

"Are you ready, Ben? Let's get back and meet the Jedi," Woroken asks of his human friend. "We can get whatever supplies everyone needs with these truguts."
*DW, for the record, I have found it easier to make a new character sheet at every level. On the PC thread, Woro is updated to level three at the most recent post. I have been decudting credits, medpacs, etc. from that sheet.*

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-25 17:16:04)

*Ben, you are certain it is a real form of currency, as a native of Tatooine you are 100 percent sure that it is real. It is not the first time you've seen it.*

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-25 17:16:39)

*Sounds good Woro, just want to make sure things are being tracked.*

Woroken and Ben begin going back to meet up with the remainder of Red Team.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-26 14:08:14)

Woroken and Bennosuke finish their transaction with the jawa. They turn around and walk away from the bazaar. As they scan the crowd, they notice that Bordo's militia seems to be out in full force, as their are more people toting around blaster rifles. It's safe to assume they are trying to get to the bottom of this morning's incident.
They make it back to the Bantha Track's without anything happening. They can see Red Team dispersed out in the crowd of drinking patrons. The kids seem to be hovering around Awne.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-26 14:27:09)

Woroken walks over to where the children were sitting and ruffles their hair with a friendly growl. He moves to the counter and pantomimes eating to the individual working the counter, then points at Ben and himself, indicating they needed breakfast, before rejoining the group at the table.
After sitting down, he shows Voren, Awne and Rith the truguts they had received for their bounty.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-26 15:01:53)

Awne blinks at the money showed to the group, reaching out to grab one. "How much did you get forr the goods?" She holds it up as she talks, turning it over and over looking at it. "What kind of currrrency is this anyway?"

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-26 22:05:41)

Rith stops Woroken as he is about to order.
Rith:" Hold it buddy, our priority right now is to get these kids to Alus...she must be worried sick. I know wookiee's like to think with their stomach sometimes. Let's get the group together and then we'll escort the kids."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-26 23:18:06)

Awne nods and looks up at the wookiee with a smile, "You'd want yourr kits as soon as possible, we can forrgo a little food to make it fasterr."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-27 08:44:01)

The wookiee nods in agreement, and prepares to depart with the group. He makes a mental note to himself to put forth a slightly lessened effort the next time Rith needed healing, however.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **ganthet** (2008-01-27 13:42:11)

"Not bad Woro, Ben." "I thought those weapons would fetch agood price." "Now I am fed, and fueled and ready to go. Let's get those kids home and see what our other friends want." Vor'en pays the tab and moves to leave out the door. Field kit on his back and new rifle slung on his shoulder. E-11 always at the ready. "Lets go guy we ain't got all day." Ben you know the way, I will take point and rest of you follow. Rith cover the rear."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-27 13:51:09)

Awne nods to the old soldier, sends a smile to Rith, and herds the kids up and out the door after everyone. One of her hands idly checks to make sure her new blaster was on her hip as she walks.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-27 20:22:05)

"Hold on." Ben says, grabbing Awne's shoulder. "There were a lot of Bordo's thugs out there. We need to be careful. It would be too risky to just walk out there, we need to think of some way to hide the kids and get ourselves to the embassy safely. Can we get rags to dress them up as Jawas?"

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **ganthet** (2008-01-27 20:41:58)

"Kid, I don't think they are going to attack us in the middle of the day." "And besides we took care of them last time." Vor'en looks around to see if everything is clear. "We have other things to do today also, so lets get moving."
(OCC: Prepection check 1+d20 to make sure anyting is cool.)

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-27 22:38:38)

Rith watches as the group is getting into a formation. He hears Bennosuke and approaches Vor'en.
Rith: "He may of messed things up last night. But Bennosuke makes a point. If you haven't noticed, Bordo's men are out in full force. We may not be able to stand up to them even if we had to. Remember those hover bins we picked up last night? We should trying using those to transport the kids to the embassy. But it's up to you, you are acting like the chief around here."
*Vor'en's Perception 17+1=18*
Vor'en takes a peek outside just beyond the Bantha Track's door. He can clearly see Bordo's men with their raggy clothes and bandoliers, armed with the same type of blaster rifles you captured yesterday. They seem to be highly suspicious and questioning people all around them. Vor'en begins to wonder how Bordo got such a control of this area and why. Perhaps it would be a question to ask the locals when they had more time. But for now, they had to figure a way to safely make it from point A to point B. Also, Awne was aware that the Jedi wanted to meet in thirty minutes roughly.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-27 23:03:03)

Awne bites her lip, her tail flicking in thought "Rrith has a good idea therre..eitherr way we need to get moving ourr otherr frriends want to meet us in a half hourr."

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-28 11:45:32)

"Well, therre could be lots of rreasons why someone would be pushing a crrate. Only a few of those thugs saw us, and you all took carre of them rright? so it's safe to prresume that these guys arre looking forr the kids since they don't know what we look like rright?"
*Side note, Rad seems to have vanished, he's not in the bar.*

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **ganthet** (2008-01-28 15:39:20)

"Ok,kids got a point." Vor'en steps back inside and looks around. "Is there a back way out of this place?" " "If not the we will have go out the front and hope they aren't good enuf to spot us." Vor'en turns the idea over in his mind."*They shouldn't know what we look like they will know the kids…"*
"Ok, Ben and Rith find what ever we need to get these kids to look like something else, then we will head out hope there memorys are really short."

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-28 17:47:23)

"If we can get uniforms or something the bins will work, because it will appear we are doing something official. Otherwise it will be suspicous for a team of civilians to be carrying covered hover bins, we'll just stick out like a rancor on cloud city. Bordo's thugs may not be the brightest, but they'll be looking for a group of humans a wookie and a Fargul trying to smuggle kids. Also because of this, I think it's smart of Awne sneaks off ahead. That way if something happens we have someone who can surprise the enemy, and she can warn us of impending danger. Furthermore Fargul's are far less common than wookies, and she will be the first one they look for. If she's hiding then we have a better chance of survival."

"Here's a thought," Woroken says to Ben, "Did you notice if there was a speeder rental place back there in the market? With our full purse, we might rent something that would move much quicker than merely on foot."
*Couple questions DW, 1. What kind of check would I have to make to answer the above question? 2. How far are we from that place we met the Jedi at, and I guess are supposed to meet them at this time?*

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-28 19:01:14)

Awne's tail twitchs "You want me to leave you with the kits and go on ahead?" It was probably a good idea, she wasn't common for this area and sneaking on ahead to not be seen would be best; but maturnal instinct said to not leave kittens with men. She frowns "Give me a hat and something to coverr my waist." To make in understood why something to cover her waist, her tail wraps a few times around her waist and stills.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-29 00:59:50)

*Renting a speeder sounds wise. It would be a gather information check to find where to rent a speeder. Also, if any of you plan on disguising, remember to do the check. The Jedi want to meet you in thirty minutes.*

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-29 01:12:29)

Awne sighs and looks around the bar for someone wearing a hat.
*Perception +6*

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-29 01:25:08)

Awne sees that the most popular version of hats is rags wrapped around the head, many people in the bar seem to be wearing these. Some of them appear to be wearing helmets.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **ganthet** (2008-01-29 01:27:46)

"Speeder sounds like agood idea." Vor'en looks at Woro and Ben. "You to have the creds go take care of it." Vor'en looks at everyone else. "When they get back here with the speeder everyone be ready to jump in and go." "I will cover from the door, kids frist then everyone else." Vor'en hopes to himself that this will not become another fire fight.

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-01-29 01:28:21)

Awne hums at the rags on the heads, muttering to Vor'en "You know we could call the lady and have herr meet us herre with a bit of an escorrt orr somethin...not like someone would mess with the Rrepublic. Eitherr way speederr sounds like a good plan, I can always lay in the back underr something." she glances at Rith "Like Rrith's coat."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-01-29 01:32:26)

*You estimate if you gather info for the speeder rental the jedi's will meet you by that time. Not that having the Jedi with you would be a bad thing, but they might inquire why you have those kids following you around.*

Rith walks up to Vor'en...
Rith: "Hey chief, regardless of what we do. We don't want to look like we are executing a military operation here."
Rith walks back to the bar and orders a drink, nonchalantly scanning the area.

"Well if Woro and Ben get the speeder we can just walk out hope they don't see us and taske the kids home." "Other wise it is a running battle to where we need to go and that would complicate thing alot." Vor'en looks over at Rith. "Besides this old soldiers been in the miltary to long to think any other way." Vor'en says with a smlie diging around in his pockets for a cigar. Finding one he looks up at Anwe. "Don't worry darlin' I ain't licked yet I will get us out of here and them home."

*DW, just so I am sure, what you are saying is by the time we would find the speeder rental place, it would already be time to meet the Jedi. So, the idea really won't work that well. My post below is assuming that to be true.*
"I guess disguises are the best idea. We don't have time to go get the speeder and get to the meeting with the Jedi. We could com the Jedi and tell them to come meet us partway, and escort us the end of the trip. I can carry the children in the boxes, and the rest of you could cover me, I suppose..." Woroken tells Ben and asks him to relate his statement to the rest of the party.

Ben relayes what Woro said to the rest of the group. "I think that's a good idea. If Woro can carry all of them in one bin, then this could work. Voren and Rith can act like slavers pushing Woro around, if that's all right with you Woro. The rest of us can either pair off or just give them some space, and that way we don't attract too much attention as a large group. Even if Woro does attract attention, it won't appear to be what they are looking for, and if we keep enough space between each other everything should be fine."

"I can handle it...for the children's sake," Woroken tells Ben. "I think your plan makes sense. Only a couple of people will blend much better than the remainder of the group. Everyone else can follow and watch us from distance." As the group needed to leave soon, Woroken took all his visible weapons, the bowcaster, the pistol, and the spear and passed them to Ben and Vor'en for safekeeping. He stowed the frag grenades out of site, in case things got really bad. He waited for Awne to inform "her kits" of the plan.

"Anwe get the kids ready to move when they get here." "If wee are lucky they won't notice us and we can slip away if We get even luckier the Jedi will get here and we will have some more help." "We will just have to figue out a way to make the kids look different, the boxes well I think there are enuf people moving stuff around they won't notice it to much."

*We could do that some of us take the kids and the rest meet the Jedi. We need to do something before the Jedi show up. We need away to ditch the guys watching the bar and leave with the kids. If this place has a back way out I would like to know.*
Vor'en moves to the driod tending bar. "Excuse me could you tell me if there is a back way out of here?" Vor'en starts to plan something that might just work. "If we have another way out,we can check that out and if it is cool we take the kids out that way and some of us head out the front."
"This is all kind of ify though they maybe watching the back as well."

The droid looks at Vor'en confused.
Protocol Droid: "I'm sorry sir, there is only one way out of here, and you just looked at it. I know, it can be rough with this many people and only one way out."
*Woro, it's really no big deal about the Jedi deadline. They just wanted to meet you in a half hour. It would just take too long for one of you to find the speeder shop. The Jedi mentioned to keep all of you together as much as possible. So, if you value the Jedi's request…you would dismiss the speeder idea to save time.*

### **ganthet** (2008-02-02 01:13:32)

"Ok so much for that looks like we are going to have to go out the front or wait here for the Jedi." Vor'en thinks things though some more. "Awne what time did the Jedi say he wanted to meet us, maybe we might have to head out that door and make a run for it." Vor'en doesn't like the idea anymore then anyone else but it might be there only hope.
*Ok guys we have to do something this setting around waiting is not going to get use any where. DW I want to do a Knowledge Tactics role d20 +8 I think to see if there is any other way out of this.*

Awne chuckles at the soldier and pulls out her comlink waiting for the jedi to pick up. She looks around at the other members of Red Team with a smile, they'd been together for just a few days and it felt like she'd known them forever. She looks over at the kids, laughing at seeing them play with the wookiee, her tail flicking from side to side lazily; she knew she didn't have to keep an eye on them now, they'd be fine with the wookiee playing with them, though maternal instincts said to check over every so often just to make sure. She takes a seat beside Vor'en; her eyes roaming over to Rith where they rest, a gentle smile on her face.

*Vor'en's Knowledge Tactics check 8+5=13.* 
Vor'en takes a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey shot from the grimy protocol droid. He thinks back to his days in his stormtrooper division, he draws blanks about the current situation. Most of the missions he encountered in cities was under his Lieutenant's direct command,and he was unsure how to move through Mos Esre discreetly. Usually, it was standard operating procedure to just blast through a town when they wanted something. But with his group, as a leader, it was imperative that he adapt to today's objective... keep the kid's alive. He reluctantly took a sip of his drink, and realized ten minutes had passed toward their deadline with the Jedi. If they sat tight, perhaps the Jedi would present a solution to get through the town full of inquiring thugs.

The young boy and his three sisters tug at the Wookiee's fur, hovering around him because they felt a bit safer from the bar's ruffians. The littlest girl crawls onto his lap and hugs him, patting his chestnut colored mane.

The wookie erupts in a loud, almost bark of laughter, playing with the little children. He had always been concerned about scaring the young of different species, being so large and different, so he had never really interacted in this way before.
While playing, Woroken scanned the bar, and noticed Ben paying particular attention to the food coming out of the kitchen. Woroken, although saying nothing, had noticed Ben's gaunt build, and threadbare clothing. He had also noticed than in the few days he had known, Ben, he had not seen him with any credits whatsoever. It was clear he was exteremly strapped for credits. Woroken did not want to point this out and embarrass Ben in front of the others, though.
"Ben, I have my hands full over here," Woroken pointed to the children hanging onto him and sitting in his lap, "Could you grab us a couple bowls of whatever the barkeep can prepare quickly? Assuming we have time of course..." he said looking at Awne on her com. He reached his cred chip over the table to Ben without commenting on anything else.

Woroken pantomimes "eating a bowl of soup" towards Awne. He could always eat one of his rations on the run, but he would really like to squeeze in a quick bite here, since it could be awhile before he gets warm food again. If the wookie had to put up a fight to defend the kids, he wanted to be hale and hearty.

If you are watching Rith, you notice he has a shocked look on his face as he is staring down at the bar table. He shakes his head for a second as if it was nothing. It seems like something disturbed him, but he is fine now. Awne can sense that strange feeling she has been noticing since she went on Telares station, that same sensation that got her out of the ship rubble amazingly. The sensation, is emanating around Rith, and then it quickly fades.

### **zerah** (2008-02-04 23:20:58)

Awne can no longer sense that sensation coming from him.

Woroken, while playing with the young'uns, couldn't help but overhear some of the conversation between the "odd couple." The wookiee still didn't completely trust Rith--after seeing the rage behind his attack on Radon, he wasn't sure he ever would. Awne clearly felt a connection to Rith though. "Just a strange crew I've hooked up with..." he thought, before picking up the little girl and holding up above his head, as she cackled with laughter.

Awne frowns at the human, she felt a little hurt that he didn't want to talk to her about..whatever it was; she squashed that down though, didn't need to be going completely fem.
"We have the kids yes, but I can worrrry about you too" she takes his hand in hers, "you'rre a memberr of the team now, we look out forr eachotherr." She places her other on his cheek, looking into his eyes "I carre about you, I'll let it go, but please talk to me Rrith.." She wanted to say more but now wasn't the best time for talks like that, she could wait until the kids were safe and she could talk to him alone.

Rith: "Sorry, I just need some time alone. I have a strange feeling going through me that I cannot explain. Just come get me when the Jedi get here, or we decide to leave."
Rith turns and makes his way through the bar's patrons. He goes upstairs to the lodging rooms.

Awne sighs as he leaves her grasp, her head hangs hiding the hurt. *'what happened? did he stop carring forr me? No…no he said he..just needed to be alone.'* she thinks to herself. She wanted very badly to go after him, but at the same time wanted to respect his wishes to be alone.
She sighs, and weaves her way back to the table with the old soldier and sits while bringing her head to meet the table, her tail doesn't move much, an outside sign that she was distressed. "What do you do when someone you carre about, and trruly like, doesn't want to talk to you and just wants to be alone? Do you follow them anyway? Vorr...what do I do?"

"Well, I would wait until he is ready to talk to you about." "He knows that you are there for him and he will come around." "Remeber Rith is a a complecated man, he has some stuff to work out." Vor'en looks at Anwe. He can tell that she is consered for Rith and Vor'en doesn't want to see her hurt. But this is one situation that a blaster would not cure and he is out of his element on this.

Awne makes a whining sound, much like a kitten would do. She smiles slightly though, batting at the glass that's put in front of her for a minute before bringing it closer and sniffing at it; a habit she never chose to break. If it was new and unfamilier, hell even if it was familier she sniffed at it before drinking or eating it. She takes a lap at the drink, her eyes going cross for a minute before she starts to cough "What in the starrs is that stuff?"

*You now have fifteen minutes until the Jedi contact you for the meeting.*
Red Team moves back and forth, some are sitting down, and some have done other things. But it seems your suspicious actions have not escaped the attention of one young little boy in the cantina. You kind of wonder how he got in here, just as you wonder how the young kids were able to get in. Perhaps it was because lodging is allowed here. The little one watching your group appears to be a healthy young human boy of fifteen years. His shoulder length brown hair is tied back using braids on the left and right side that match the length of his hair, and his bright blue eyes stand out. He is young, but his eyes show wisdom and you get the feeling this young boy is somewhat capable, but it is hard to look past his youth. He is clothing is worn a bit favoring browns, greens, and black colors, but a noticeable out of place yellow scarf stained of blood and sweat covers his nose, mouth and neck and underneath you can see a breath mask. Atop his head rests a pair of goggles for eye protection, and on his hip a medical kit. The only noticeable weapon he displays is a knife strapped to the bottom of his right leg, a blaster pistol on his hip and the barrel of a sporting rifle that his all temperate cloak cannot hide on his back. Overall his clothing is a bit dusty and weathered.

Awne sighs and moves her head looking around the Cantina, after glancing back at the kids and the wookiee to make sure they're alright. She looks around, her eyes coming to rest on the boy; her tail flicks by her chair and pokes the old soldier to get his attention, it then points in the direction of the boy. She leans back in her chair her eyes on the boy though she speaks quietly to Vor'en, "What in the galaxy is a boy doing in herre with those kinds of weapons.."

"Might check this out though. Be right back." Vor'en moves over to where the kid is. Trying to gauge wheither or not the kid is going to be a problem.

*You can see the young man moving around the cantina, you catch him looking for something, but he catches your movement towards him and straightens up when the you start to make your way towards him, its obvious he is on edge and his hand slowly goes for his pistol on his hip. He doesn't draw the weapon, but he seems a bit defensive. As you get closer its obvious the young man is mal nourished, it looks as though he has been through hell. A lighter shade of skin color surrounds his eyes where his goggles have been protecting him from the twin suns, and his face and clothes are dusty with trails of sand covering his body. He never draws his weapon and let's you come to talk to him, now you can see in his eyes something you did not see before, fear.*

**Hadru**, "**..water..**" He able to breath out with a raspy cotton dry mouth that is muffled even more by his breath mask and dirty mustard yellow scarf.

*Vor'en's Knowledge Tactics Check 8+6=14. Ten minutes until the Jedi contact you.*
Vor'en looks at the young one who has been watching his group. His pistol seems to be of a slugthrower type, considerably less dangerous than blasters, but still lethal nonetheless. He is carrying a standard hunting blaster rifle, and a knife. He seems young, but you don't know what kind of combat experience he has or training he might have undergone. It would be impossible at this point to determine the threat level, but he seems exhausted.

"Set down son I will get you taken care of." Vor'en says to the youth. "Barkeep food and water for my friend here, make it quick." Vor'en turns to Woro. Motioning him to come and check out the boy. "Woro I need some help over here." "What did you get yourself into son." "You loook like a rancor spit you out, open desert is no place to running around with out backup." Vor'en stands a short distance from the kid blaster hand at his side just in case. He can see if he were to draw on him it wouldn't be much of a contest.

Awne watchs the soldier approach the boy and motion for the wookiee to join him. The Farghul stands and moves over to the kids, taking the girl that was in his arms into hers and purring at her with a gentle smile. She then sits down in the now unoccupied chair, her tail moving to the side and poking at a few of the children then waving as an invitation to play though the owner doesn't move the rest of her body; one would think the tail has a mind of it's own.
Awne coos to the girl in her lap, ears twitching and turning to listen to the rest of the bar for any danger as she smiles and tickles the little ones. Woro leaves knowing their in good hands and walks to the 'leader' of Red Team, motioning while asking what was needed.

*When the young man realizes that you are going to help him he eases his hand off his pistol hilt. He joins you to your table and graciously accepts the food and water.*
**Hadru**,"It started two days ago, I was leading an expedition across the dune sea. The first storm wasn't so bad, but it disabled our speeder transportation. We had to abandon the vehicle, probably Jawa scrap by now."
*The boy unwraps his scarf so it rests on his shoulders and unclasps his breath mask to take a drink from the cup. Some sand shakes off him as he makes his slow tired movements. His lips show signs of dehydration, dried up with peeling skin. Now that you see his uncovered face, he is a handsome young boy.*
**Hadru**, "Thank you kind sir, you are generous. It is fortuitous to meet such kind people, especially on this desolate world.." He is well spoken and speaks in basic with a hint of High Galactic tone, not your normal uneducated backwater slang."
*He takes another drink of water finishing the cup, he seems to be feeling physically better with every drink and bite of food, but his attitude is still distant and somber.*
**Hadru**,"I am used to going out on long expeditions alone, but never with the responsibility of others. I made it to this planet by working for anyone, I'm just trying to find myself some work to keep going. I naively and against my common sense took out a small loan from a loan shark here on Tatooine. I thought I would be able to make a name for myself as a guide. I geared up with what I needed, but I wasn't prepared for what happen next."
*Hadru takes a bite of food, and continues…*
**Hadru**,"A job opportunity opened up and I jumped on it, but it was one I should have let go. I was late on payment and up against a wall not making scraps for credits my loan shark offered me a transportation job to clean my debt. A simple task, transport some cargo across the dune sea to some palace. I had the speeder, the coordinates and the equipment, then the cargo…. Well that was a problem. You see the cargo were "servants" illegal slave trade i think, and I didn't want the job, but I found my survival at stack. I put aside my morale judgment, just once so I can get out of debt. Two guards accompanied me, more like slime ball thugs, to make sure I didn't screw up and the cargo would get there safely."
*Hadru starts to feel more uncomfortable talking about this, especially in the Cantina. He knows that eavesdropping ears can be listening, but he has a good feeling about these people and continues*
**Hadru**,"After losing the speeder everything went downhill, and the slaves were starving and thirsty. He had to take extended shelter. Of course the stupid thugs didn't have any extra rations or water ethier so I was sharing mine with everyone. It was at that moment when one of the young Twi'lek girls wanted a drink and the Thug took the canteen away and started to drink the last bit a water. I flew into a rage, and pulled my gun on him demanding the last canteen back. Things got ugly, and all I can say is the sand swallowed the thugs."
*Hadru eyes start to water, but he holds back his emotions and doesn't let a tear drop. Trying to stay strong and show no weakness.*
**Hadru**,"I tried… I tried… to get them back… to saftey… I had a plan to hide them in an old abandoned cave that I have made a safe house on trips through the desert, but I couldn't protect them, and on foot the desert is a hungry monster that is never satiated. I lost them… all to the desert. I barely made it back here alive."
*Hadru hides his emotions eating his food, he is constantly looking around the Cantina. He knows that he will be visited soon.*

**Hadru**,"Thank you again, My name is Hadru Kazo, most people call me kid, it doesn't bother me much but it doesn't help when I'm trying to get work. If your serious about your offer I accept, any paying job is better then working for Bordo the Hutt. If there was ever someone you should stay away from it is him, the big slime ball slug is some big shot here in Mos Esre. I don't think he is going to like that I didn't get his "cargo" to its destination, nor that his thugs won't be returning."

A nights rest should heal any fatigue and superficial wounds, it was the deeper emotional wounds that would need more time to heal, and no medical kit could resolve. As he finishes up his last scraps of food, Hadru never stops looking over his shoulder, he seems very nervous.*

Woroken accepts the kid's gesture that he needed no medical attention. The wookiee simply gave him a friendly nod in greeting, and to not push the nervous human too far, he went back to playing with the younger children.

Moving her tail away from the others, grinning when they frowned that the toy was leaving but cheering up at the sight of the big wookiee sitting down to play with them again.
Knowing they were in good hands she weaves her way to the bar standing beside the kid and looking him over "You don't look so good, betterr than when you walked in but not grreat yet...what's yourr name?"

*Hadru can't help but look at the young children in the Cantina playing, its like time slows down as he watches them smile and giggle at Woroken. An innocence that was taken away from Hadru, he remembers when he was in the fields playing with his brother, such peaceful times. Hadru's thoughts fade and he is snapped back into reality when he hears another patron enter the Cantina. He suspiciously looks at the Bothan, but tries to keep a low profile hiding his face. Hadru wraps his dirty mustard yellow scarf around his face hiding most of his face and keeping to himself.*

*Awne's perception check 6+14=20.*
Awne was able to catch the conversation between Hadru and Vor'en as they spoke. The kids seemed to continue orbiting Awne and Woroken, as they seemed just like pets to the kids. Indeed, a big wookiee and a nimble farghul is truly a sight to behold, especially to the big imagination of a child.
Meanwhile, a bothan has entered the cantina. He quickly notices that the cantina is quite full for this time of morning. The place was small but obviously the people didn't mind it. The lifestyle of Tatooine denizens seemed to revolve around roughness, so this would explain the large amount of patrons. The bar itself has no lights illuminated and the lighting is coming from the bright sunlight pouring from the large arched door the bothan just walked through. The wind is whipping through the door and scattering sand throughout the dusty cantina. There seemed to be no particular entertainment at the moment besides boisterous laughs, chatting, and drinks. The people themselves are wearing tunics, mercenary-like armor, or rags to conceal them from the harsh suns. The races are as varied as you could imagine; ranging from rodians, duros, ithorian, humans, or lesser known beings. The bartender is a black-chrome protocol droid, and he seems to be enjoying his work, no matter how busy he seems.
Awne continues her conversation with her friends, but she quickly realizes her comlink is beeping.

Woroken heard the beeping of Awne's comlink. As he knew the time to meet wtih the Jedi and move the children was close, he did a quick scan of the cantina for anything out of the norm in such a hardscrabble place. He was especially looking for any of the slavers who were no doubt looking for them by now. "I'm not moving the kids until I'm sure everything is safe," he thought to himself.

But as far as work goes, ask around, people are always looking to hire hands for some job. There are no real companies to work here for. Falsoor Research is about the only place that is a set organization with good pay."
*The other party members next to the bar can notice the name Falsoor immediately. Falsoor's expedition is what got this whole journey started.

"The safest way to get the kids out is in the boxes," Woroken thought to himself. He began the process of emptying one of the boxes of toys and determining how best to arrange the children. "If the two smallest children can both fit in a single box, we can still get at least some of their toys for the trip..." he pondered.
The wookiee also pulled out his all weather cloak to shade the boxes, as the children were no doubt going to be very hot in the enclosed space of the toybox.
Woroken had already decided he was going to give the children's grandmother a good chunk of his share of the recently gained party kitty to begin a new life with. It would be nice if they could keep at least some of their toys for what was going to be no doubt an unexpected (for the kids) relocation.

Awne walks up the sand-covered stairs towards the lodging rooms. She looks in all of them, and finds that Rith is at the end of the hallway looking through glassless window at the end of area. She approaches and immediately feels the sensation she has been experiencing since she was on Telares station. It was like hearing a faint heartbeat of that energy she couldn't describe, it was getting louder...then it was getting fainter and quiet. As if it was intentionally trying to be cut off. He noticed Awne and turned around.
Rith: "Yes? Is it time to leave?"
Back in the entertainment area, Woroken observed the boxes, he remembered that 4 were empty. The fifth box had the kid's favorite toys in them. Luckily, the boxes were long and deep enough to fit the small children. The droid bartender looks at Red Team, and then back at the bothan.

*You don't hear the sound. Just to let you know, OOC it was the Force that Awne was feeling. She self-trained herself to use it but doesn't really realize it yet. It was something she did when she underwent rigorous martial arts training years ago, she meditated in the most nature associated areas.

At that moment, you notice the three Jedi walking in...they are trying their best to not look suspicious...but they stand out by looking like three very capable humans. They quickly spot the group and walk to them. Master Lorhas scratches his slightly-wrinkled face and speaks to Awne.
Lorhas: "We can walk these young ones to their grandmother whenever you're ready. It is not good for kids to be hanging out in a cantina."
Mur Eva: "Such a rough crowd master, don't see why these people allowed these kids to hang around them for even a minute."
Lorhas: "Exactly, you don't see why, therefore you have no need for that tone for something you know nothing about."

Awne smiles as Rith leads her back downstairs; watching the kids and the wookiee. She looks over as the door opens smiling at the Jedi "You kinda stand out you know." She says to Lorhas, frowning at the woman at the comment. She then ruffles one of the boys hair and gathers them together, nodding to the others "Lets get going then. Would it be best to hide them in these crates we have orr walk them frreely?"

Rith overhears the bothan talking to the droid as he decides to buy a drink, he speaks to the bothan nonchalantly as he quickly downs his shot.
Rith: "Be careful my friend, you may be pulling strenuous work from them, because one of their heavy-duty transports crashed into the desert near this settlement. Not to mention you may get caught in the proceedings of their likely investigations."
Rith walks back towards his group and prepares to leave.

Vor'en motions for there new friend to join them."We are headin out you comin?" Vor'en turns to the Bothan at the bar if you are going to work for that outfit I would take out some insurance and get some better gear then what you have. You will need it." "Oh and if they ask you to go on a ship, don't." Vor'en turns to the Jedi and motions for the door. "I will head out frist follow behind, Ben direct us to where we are going everyone stay alert. Lets move." With that Vor'en heads for the door with his E-11 at the ready. Stoping at the Jedi's question. "Well we where going to try to sneak them out but now I don't think that is going to be possibale." "Anwe, Woro stay close to the kids, Rith cover the rear." Vor'en starts moving toward the door.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-02-11 22:58:49)

Mur Eva leads Red Team's formation through the crowded and sandy streets. She makes sure to get through the most populated areas briefly. Most of the alleyways you cross seem have next to no one occupying them. After about fifteen uneventful minutes of walking, you arrive at the moderate sized building of the Republic embassy. It seems to be isolated from the rest of residential area. The building looks very sturdy and clean, with a crimson color that yields an official look. The roof is dome shaped and there is a small door at the front. Two Republican soldiers flank the door and have immediately noticed you. The soldiers salute the Jedi.
Soldier: "Sir, what can we do for you?"
Lorhas: "Good day men, we'd like to get these kids to their grandmother."
Soldier: "You must mean Alus, we'll inform her immediately."
The soldier goes inside, and after about five minutes Alus runs out...tears filling her eyes. The kids surround her and give her a tight hug. The Jedi observe this scene with a smile.
Alus stands and talks to the group.
Alus: "Oh thank you, I don't know how to repay you. I'm sorry, but we have a ticket for public transport, and we have to leave immediately. May the Force be with you all."
The boy looks at Woroken, seemingly ignoring his grandmother for a moment. He gives Woroken a thumbs up, with a tear in his eye.

Awne watchs the bothan, somethin about him just made her fur puff, a growl kept emiting from her when he started to move too close to her, Rith, Woro or Vor'en, mostly if he got too close to Rith or Vor'en; in her eyes the wookiee was able to take care of himself, maybe it was instinct..like when one of the students brought their dog and another brought their cat..those two animals just didn't get along...poor dog never stood a chance.

Woroken smirks seeing the palpable discomfort of the feline-like Farghul. Quite the protective one, she was. That was one characteristic they had in common, except hers was more motherly and his was more of a simple protection of his friends.
The wookie was again silent, as he was back in the presence of the Jedi. He always felt strange around them, almost a feeling of unworthiness. He knew he had information they wanted, but decided to wait for them to broach that subject, instead of doing it himself.

I just spent the last 4 years of my life in the New Republic's service, I understand how things are. By the way my name is Keth. It is nice to see that there are still folks out here that are willing to make sacrifices for the helpless.

Lorhas: "Yes, we definitely have more lined up for you. I hope you are willing to help us. You all may have many questions, as we do for you. So if you'd like, let's go inside the building and get everything out in the open. Now som....."
The Jedi is interrupted by a well-dressed uniformed man briskly walking out the door.
Officer: "Master Jedi? You know of the Star Destroyer right? Do you have any idea why they are here? Because my intelligence reports they have been stopping as many ships as they can leaving Tatooine."
Lorhas: "I'm afraid I don't know. But, for Alus's sake, I suggest she stay here with her grandchildren for the time being under your protection."
Alus takes the 500 truguts and bows courteously to Woroken.
Alus: "I can do that, I don't want to deal with Remnant scum."
Officer: "Yes, we will accommodate her needs comfortably. Are these people the one's responsible for saving the children?"
The officer points at the diverse Red Team.
Feldon: "Yes, they are very noble."
Officer: "When you are done speaking with them Jedi, send them to my office. I have a job proposition for them."
Lorhas: "Certainly, we could use them in the Republic. Now, if you don't mind, let's get a room to talk."
Master Lorhas gestures towards the door with a smile.

Awne moves to the Jedi masters side, intent on getting some things cleared up, but without the others near by "Misterr Lorrhas? I...I dunno how to say this without coming off crrazy but I'm hoping you'll be someone that can explain it to me." Looking around she leans in and begins to tell him about the heartbeat sound she had heard when she went to see Rith, that it was the same kind of energy around the wookiee and that helped her move the things that were on top of her after the crash, as well as what she felt on the station "Please..I'm not crrazy, I don't misshearr things, I know I hearrd a hearrtbeat sound, please tell me you know what it was..orr atleast can tell me who does know."

"If I'd had known the Republic was handing out jobs I'd have signed up awhile ago." Vor'en follows the Jedi. "So what is this bussiness of a Star Destroyer in orbit?" "That can't be good and we are along way from the Remiate. " " Couldn't the you guys just send some ships and run them off?" " Not that I am worried, It is just that I don't have good relations with the Reminate army and I would like to aviod any unplentess that come up."

The officer walks inside the building and takes a right down a small hallway. The Jedi escort you to the left. The building has a military-ruggedness to it, with grated floors and thick durasteel walls. The lights were bright and the ceiling was low. You pass about 2 doors on your left and right, then the Jedi go right into a room. There is a large rectangular table in the center of the room, and there appears to be machines on the cabinets for refreshments. On the table, is a vidscreen embedded in the surface that seems to be powered off. It seems this room is designated for operations planning. There is more than enough chairs for all of you.
The Jedi have a seat and Mur Eva begins on preparing some food/drinks for the group.
Lorhas: "Firstly, we have a lot to cover. So let's begin with names. If you haven't met me, I'm Jedi Master Kel-Yun Lorhas. I'm on a top secret mission for the Republic."
The younger Jedi next to him introduces himself.
Feldon Azrik: "I'm his apprentice, Feldon Azrik. I'm known as a healer to the Jedi Order. One of the few in existence."
Mur Eva looks back as she has opened a package to put in a pot of water.

Awne sighs and steps into the room, her tial flicking slightly as she walked with her thoughts all a jumble at being ignored. She steps into the room and takes a seat, her tail coiling around her ankles for the moment. At the introductions she leans back into her chair, and figures she might as well be the first of Red Team to introduce herself "I'm Awne Torra." she said, she wasn't sure what else needed to be said so she left it at that, 'if they want to ask questions they can ask I don't need to give morre inforrmation than needed' she thinks to herself.

Woroken, while clearly still nervous around the Jedi, mutters lowly, hoping to not disturb the Jedi Master's speech, to the female Jedi, Mur Eva, who he had conversed with in the past, "Hello again, Mur Eva. After this meeting, I have to pick up some medical supplies for the group. Could you tell me the best and or closest spot around to pick up medical items?"

The wookiee thought for a second after answering, and several items came to mind--"Master Lorhas, what happened with the transport ship being sabatogued? Do we know the status of any of the Jedi that seem to be missing? Have you heard from Orwen?" The wookie took a breath after the questions rolled quickly out of his mouth.

Rith speaks back jokingly.
Rith: "I'm only going for the farghul. Be glad that's the reason, otherwise I'd just as soon go to a Republic cell."
Lorhas: "I don't care your reasoning for this service, so long as you do it. Now, Woroken...those are very important questions. The Jedi you speak of, is us. We were delayed in getting to the Telares station. We were there on a mission that has not yet been completed."
Feldon: "The mission is highly confidential. We are looking for a Remnant defected officer, a communications officer that possesses some intelligence that might be of extreme importance to the New Republic."
Lorhas: "He's correct, the intelligence might be a red herring or a trap. It is also possible the intelligence has no real value. That is why they sent Jedi to handle this instead of standard Republic agents. The defected officer is known as Rast Drowen, aka Orwen Gerad...his cover identity."

"Orwen , er Rast, is a Remnant officer?" Woroken thinks to himself disappointedly for a short moment. Over the couple of days they had all met, Woroken had definitely considered Orwen a friend. "At least he was defecting..."
The wookie asks Master Lorhas if there had been any news from or about Rast since the conversation the wookie had with the Jedi the prior morning.

Awne had been quietly listening to the sounds of the wookiee, she made a mental note to get more lessons. At Rith's comment of being compensated she smiled, it was just so him..and she agreed. However the outburst from the Jedi caused her to stand and growl warningly, glaring at the Jedi her fur puffed and her tail whipping from side to side, yes there were guards she was sure, these people had lightsabers and could singe her fur but she'd be damned if these people, or anyone talked like that to anyone of her pack so long as she was around.
The farghul lost the rest of the conversation for the moment, instead moving over to sit in Rith's lap, she didn't want to have chairs between her and him if he needed her. She liked Lorhas, but boy did he loose a few pegs on her good list. Her ears twitch at the mention of Orwen being the defected officer, turning with interest to the conversation now. The wookiee knew him better and she didn't trust herself yet to ask any questions..and previous questions had gone unanswered and evaded which lead her to not be too keen on asking anything. She'd wait.

Lorhas watches the display from the outraged farghul.
Lorhas: "Please be calm, we have a lot to go over."
He takes a moment to compose himself.
Lorhas: "Unfortunately, the last we heard from Rast is that he was on the Telares station. He was awaiting transport to the surface of Tatooine with the same ship you guys were on. That night when we rescued you, we were amazed that you were the only survivors. We could find no trace of his body, but most of the other people were accounted for on the flight manifest. We don't know if he somehow survived, but we have evidence of a TIE fighter squadron attacking the ship. What was the most strange, is that there were no way those ships could have been that far out on there own. We haven't heard from Rast at all, my apprentices are losing hope. But, my strength in the Force is telling me that he is here, at this settlement. We checked Rith and it seems that he suffered minor head trauma, but only enough to cause minor memory loss."
Feldon looks at Rith.
Feldon: "Yes, it seems that you would have remembered the incident on board the ship."
Rith: "Hey, you know I'm guilty of assault. But I'm telling you the truth, I don't remember what I was doing on that ship. I don't even remember why I was in the Remnant!"
Lorhas studies Rith deeply with his eyes. Slowly but surely, Awne can hear that same sound again. It is similar to a heartbeat, a pulsing sensation of life, but it is faint. The aura keeps cutting itself off from Rith.

"Could the tie fighters have come from ship in orbit right now?" Woroken asks the Jedi. "Can you tell exactly where Rast is now?"
While asking these questions, the wookie purposefully avoids the display of the Farghul and the red eyed human. He had been taught back on Kashyyyk that the Jedi were to be respected.

Awne watchs the Jedi master looking at Rith and also looks at him, her tail flicking lightly. Her ears fold as the sounds starts up again, groaning she leans forward and rests her head on his chest "go away stupid hearrtbeat...leave me alone" she mumbles, then sighs mumbling again "I don't think the hearrtbeat likes you Rrith. The..ah..aurra keeps going away frrom you."

Rith looks at Awne confused.
Rith: "Please stop with that...we are in a meeting."
The Jedi looks at Woroken.
Lorhas: "No, my friend Corlen Doris, the Headmaster of the Telares station, told me that Star Destroyer did not go into orbit of Tatooine until after the crash. It appeared out of hyperspace shortly after. Now, you heard they are inspecting vessels that are leaving Tatooine. So I believe they are here for Rast, and they believe that he is still alive. But the question is, why would they shoot down the transport if they knew Rast was on it? This strengthens my belief that he is still alive. But where? I have no idea where to begin, and why hasn't the Remnant moved into this settlement if they were looking for him?"

### **zerah** (2008-02-13 19:35:26)

Awne sighs and moves her head enough to look at him "tell it to stop and leave me alone, how would you feel hearring something no one else can?" She sighs and looks over at the jedi, her tail curling around Rith's leg for comfort. "Maybe they'rre afterr Rrith too. those TIE fighterrs werre shooting at us afterr Rrith was on boarrd..I still say they werre trrying to stop him frrom something."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-02-13 19:35:40)

Lorhas: "But as far as Rith goes with the sabotage, I believe he is telling the complete truth. I have no doubts about that."
Mur Eva places a pot down and looks around.
Mur Eva: "Master please...you think Rast still alive? You think this man was not involved with the wrecked ship? What's next? Do you think those Imperials just want to have a festival with Tatooine?!"
Lorhas: "Young padawan, you must trust my judgment. I have felt these feelings but I was at calm, at peace. I can hear the Force in ways you can't. Because you hold on to things that your mind tells you, I only listen to the Force."

*Hadru listens to questions and only has more questions with each explanation that is given. It wasn't his place to say anything, he knew if he was going to be apart of this team he would first need to use all the patience he could muster. Hardu's mind is thinking about the many possiblities, and he reviews and analysis them in his head. Maybe the fighters didn't belong to the Star Destroyer, he thinks, followed by another thought that it could be that someone else wanted Rast dead and was ordered to destroy the ship. Too many questions, and Rith seemed to be involved some how. It was Hadru's gut feeling telling him that Rith was the key to unlocking some the mystery. All these thoughts surfaced in seconds, and then Hadru calmed his mind to continue listening to the debriefing.*

Another question was bothering Woroken. It was probably nothing, but as this might be the only time to question the Jedi, but the wookiee decided to go ahead and ask the question. "Master Lorhas, I am not even sure how to begin this question, but just before the explosion, a drunk Transoshian stumbled into our room. There was really nothing that seemed abnormal about it, but it was just strange. It was attired in a gold vest, but unfortunately did not make it off the ship alive. I don't suppose that could actually be important, could it?"

Awne moves back to Rith laying a hand on his shoulder and moving her food to him; she doesn't speak, she was upset again, confused and upset just weren't good she knew, her father told her that a lot..that and she had a temper. She moves to a corner of the room, placing her back there, and crossing her legs under her, taking a breath and closing her eyes. Her ears twitch forward to the table so she could still listen, but she needed to calm down. 'calm..peaceful..like a trree..strrong..calm..' she continues the thoughts in her mind, breathing deeply. She wasn't really meditating, just trying to calm herself.

"The only being I can remember Rast speaking to other than us, was the ithorian merchant named Derak. They had a conversation with us, then excused themselves and spoke privately. Perhaps Derak had piloting ability, even though he didn't brag about it?"

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-02-13 21:02:23)

The Jedi Master puts his spoon down and stands, he looks over the group with heavy scrutiny.
Lorhas: "Yes, you can help by staying together as a group, and perhaps asking the locals questions. I would suggest you ask questions relevant to this meeting, but keep a low profile about it. You might want to ask as to why the Imperials haven't occupied this settlement, because we've heard they have spread amongst Tatooine. But no matter what you do, you need to stay together as a group. If someone should try to interrogate you or kill you for the information you have, you have a better chance of survival as a team. I'm going to call Corlen Doris and find out about Derak. After that, we'll go do the same thing you guys are doing. We'll be separated from you to spread control across the town. We'll contact you with any updates."
Master Lorhas puts his hand to his chin and then speaks again.
Lorhas: "Don't give up hope, because our last message from Rast said he would reveal himself to us when it was safe enough. He is probably just laying low at the moment. Will there be anything else?"

The Jedi looks at Awne very concerned.
Lorhas: "I have not even told my apprentices this...but, I need all of you to survive. I can't explain this well, but the Force is strong with you. I'm sure my apprentices feel it as well, but when we sense you, it like a tremendous beacon of light through the Force. It calls to us and it seems your presence in the Force is attracting others. When you are together, I do not doubt you will survive. I believe you will have a strong influence with your surroundings. If we complete this mission intact, I'd like to take you all to the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. "
Mur Eva and Feldon seemed shocked as Kel-Yun revealed his feelings, but they did not dare argue. You expected Mur Eva to dispute, but it seemed she agreed with him. Did you all possess some tie to this mystical energy?

In fact, you are the only one in the group who it listens to. We'll touch more on this later, for now...you have other things to concern yourselves with. One more thing, I know you were kind of forced into this task, but do any of you object? If we succeed we could be helping millions of lives, or we might not even make a difference.

"And I don't know what the blasted thing is, if I knew why would I ask? you ask to seek knowledge in that which you don't know not in something you do."

The group proceeds down the hallway with the metal grating floor, the footsteps producing a distinctive clank sound. You can hear other footsteps and you wonder how many Republic people have come here. You knock on the Lieutenant's door, and after a few seconds you hear, "Come in!". You walk into a small office that seems to be just as crude looking as the hallway. He has a small vidscreen on his gray desk. There seems to be a New Republic symbol on the front of this desk, he was obviously displaying his pride. The man himself seems quite young, with a dirty-blonde shaved head. He had blue eyes that seemed to scream naiveness. His uniform was a gray two-piece suit, and he seemed to have multicolored badges on his breast. He offers a handshake to every member in Red Team.
Officer: "Greetings, I'm Lieutenant Din Frelzor. I'm in charge of operations here on Tatooine. Is this everyone that was interested?"
Back in the meeting room, Feldon unpacks his bulky medical case. He has one medikit and five medpacs. He speaks with a smile.
Feldon: "These are on the Republic, seeing as how you will help us. Keep your credits, you will need them."

While waiting for Feldon's response, Woroken and the young apprentice begin walking down the hallway to join the meeting with the Lieutenant.

Feldon looks at Woroken grimly.
Feldon: "I'm afraid we have no leads, other than what you have given us. It is truly a dire situation. All you can do is keep a low profile and maybe discover some information. My master truly thinks you are a capable group, probably stemming from his belief in your connection with the Force. So, I'd suggest you believe in yourself, and trust your feelings. Pay no attention to what Mur Eva says, she seems unfriendly, but she is truly a admirable comrade who will help you when needed."

Frelzor: "We are a new type of Republic operative. We are an expeditionary unit, and we are charged with spreading the Republic's eyes and ears across the galaxy, even on places such as these in the Outer Rim. It keeps the central source of the Republic well-informed. We are also inclined to act on behalf on the Republic as we see fit. We are given responsibility to act as a far reaching arm of the Republic. But, due to the fact in the way we recruit people; any person acting unbecoming of a Republic operative will have their contract terminated. We will also disavow any knowledge of you working with us."
Frelzor looks at the group for a moment and then speaks again.
Frelzor: "We understand that you did a good job in helping Alus into a better life, and that is the kind of action we would expect from you if you worked under us. Eventually, word of the Republic's good deeds would spread and we would be further welcomed throughout the galaxy. However, we must keep a low profile through all our operations. We do not want people such as the Hutts or any other criminal groups to know we are helping people in their territories. This is a prototype group in the Republic, it is an experimental operation. If we fail across the galaxy then our funding will be cut. We hire people like you to aid us. We don't ask that you go out of your way, we just ask to continue your lives as normal. But when you see something that is unjust, you can make it your responsibility to step in as a Republic representative at anytime."

You are permitted to gain further training from us, and you are allowed to work through the ranks."

There really was no decision to be made by Woroken. Helping others was something he had done his entire life. To continue to do the same, help the Republic, and get paid for his time was a wonderful offer, as far as he was concerned. There was a definite question as to whether the more morally...ambiguous... members of the party would be interested.
Testing the Lieutenant's knowledge of languages, Woroken states, "That sounds great to me. I am very interested."

---

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-02-14 22:19:57)

Frelzor: "Pay is on a case-by-case basis, seeing as how you aren't employed by us 24-7. We pay you based on the deeds reported. There is a downside to this however, if you help local law enforcement agency capture a known criminal, and they don't sign towards your contract...you cannot receive payment. We need some sort of proof that you helped someone and what it was, your client should know this before you help them. That is, if time allows you to inform them. Pay isn't everything in this job, you have to want to help people. Consider payment as a bonus. But you can also count on other Republic people around you if they are in your area. Capital ships will recognize your ID if you have a ship."

Frelzor: "I know, that is the downside. We don't expect you to directly interfere with criminal organizations. If you intervene, do so if you are sure you can do it without getting recognized as a Republic operative. It's not hard to just say you are a bounty hunter looking for a mark, or you are a local undercover policeman. If it's not something you guys want to do, I understand. It can be a hard life. But once again, you get all the benefits of serving the Republic as regular personnel. This means military grade equipment, perhaps even your own ship provided to you one day."

A Republic soldier comes in and collects everyone's IDs. After a few moments he comes back and hands a datapad to Lt.Frelzor, and your ID's are given back.
Lt.Frelzor: "Everything you told me was true. But Rith Bendar? Your status in the Remnant is under investigation for deserting the Imperials?! I'm sorry, but we can't have you in the Republic with the Imperials after you. The rest of you, we will allow you in. Here is the contract, we will need your autoprint on this datapad."
He presents the datapad with the contract. It tells that you are obligated to service for one year to be paid on a case-by-case basis, and you are entitled to all benefits of a Republic member. You are charged with doing the just and righteous thing while under service, and that you may possibly die in your duty. You cannot tell any false statements in this contract.
Rith seems visibly shaken after he heard the news.

Woroken steps forward, presents a furry hand, and enters his print on the datapad. "At the very least, the next year should be exciting," he thought as he stepped back for the others to sign.
It certainly did not break the heart of the wookie to see that Rith wasn't easily approved. Woro still was not convinced of his intentions, and was still not sure if he should be trusted. Rith's reaction to being denied would be entertaining to watch, though...

As the meeting winds it's way to an end, Woroken takes this opportunity to divide the remaining truguts he had received from selling the weapons from the thugs that had been rousted the night before. The wookie handed Vor'en 1100 of the currency, and gave double that to Awne indicating that Rith's was included. Woro still was not convinced of Rith, but Awne clearly backed him, and he had earned his share of the booty. Woroken kept 600 of them for himself, and gave the two new "recruits," so to speak, 300 apiece.

*Hadru take 100 credits and give the Wookiee back 200.*
**Hadru**,"I will take this for food an lodging, I will need a lot more than 300 credits to get out of debt. Keep it, you earned, but I will accept your charity."
*Hadru humbly takes the credits.*
*Hadru stood there confused. The soldier never took his I.D because he never gave him one, he was better at not being noticed then he thought. It was common for people to ignore him, after all he is young, but his attire hid his age well and he was a bit annoyed at the neglect to his offer to join.*
**Hadru speaks with an educated tone and charisma**,"I have No I.D. and no background to check with your computers. You would think that would be perfect for such a mission, but then again I may be a liability like Rith. Unknown past makes it an unknown future, but I think its hypocritical to say Rith can't join because he may be hunted by the Imperials, but he can still be a part of "Red Team". His presence will still draw trouble, just like me being apart of this team with bring trouble from the Hutt's and attention to everyone. I may be young, but I have experience and for you to ignore Rith's experience and choices he has made to make it this far is bureaucratic bantha poodu. I am no different then Rith, no one here knows anything about me, so I guess that makes me a no."
*Hadru gets up, not satisfied and very disappointed. You sense that he really wanted to be a part of something big, but he's left alone again as it always was with him. Hadru starts to to move for the door to exit and join Vor'en.*

The wookiee takes back 2/3 of the currency he had given to the "kid." Woroken liked to buy the food and drink for the Team anyway, so without realizing it, the kid's 100 would go a lot further than he realized.
Before exiting the facility, Woroken exhanges com channel info, so that he could easily be reached, and in turn, get into contact with the Republic officials.

As the wookie hands Keth the credits he says â€œThanks but this not necessary all I did was walk with you all for while. I still have credits from my discharge. If you insist on paying me I will accept no more than 100 credits.â€
Keth also provides his comlink information to both the group and Lt. Frelzor.

The wookie takes the 200 back from Keth. "Well, neither of them seem especially greedy," he thinks to himself, "That's a good sign for the future."
*Gonna use the 400 to start a new party kitty unless anyone in particular needs it…*

Lt. Frelzor observes Hadru as he speaks with great concern.
Lt. Frelzor: "You are a little young for human years. Don't you have any parents? I mean, if you got nothing, then I could welcome you into our family. But your companion Rith... he has too much trouble circling around him for him to be hired. I understand the Jedi have half a mind to take him under custody for attempted murder against the podracer. He blew the side of his face off with a blaster. No offense, but we don't want people like that in the New Republic. Regardless of how he saved the kids, it does not get you off the hook of attempted murder."
Rith agrees with the officer and then follows Awne.

"Hey kid." "I thought you would be in there learning all you could about what is at stake." Vor'en looks at Hadru. "If your worried about the Hutt don't Most of the guys he will send after you will be second class at best."
"Just being around us has brought you more trouble then a Hutt can dish out." Looking at Hardu equipment Vor'en kind of shakes his head. "I might want to find something with a little more bite then those sporting models you got." " Maybe we can fiond you something along the way."

The officer watches Hadru after talking to him and watches with concern.
Lt.Frelzor: "You seem like a good kid, it's just that it's not advisable to let someone in this young. Especially without parental consent."
Back in the Republic briefing room, Awne and Rith are having a conversation.
Rith: "You know, I don't get where your going with this heartbeat thing. But the Force, is a religion that the Jedi practice. I don't believe in it one bit, but according to them they are in tune with a mystical energy field. The energy field is like an aura that continually speaks to them, and they can manipulate this field to do magic tricks. They use the Force to achieve greater goods. I guess he thinks that you possess this attunement? They think the whole group has the Force. If you ask me, I think old man has gone senile and everyone mistakes it with wisdom. I mean come on, he is letting me off the hook to find someone who is probably already dead. It just doesn't add up."
Meanwhile, Vor'en observes the happenings outside of the embassy.
*Vor'en's Perception check 1+12=13* Vor'en notices immediately that the embassy is quite far away from the Residential area, and the crowd seems to be in that area. Indeed it was obvious that no one was around the embassy. Perhaps they wanted to have nothing to do with it. In the crowd, Vor'en can't tell for sure, but it seems the thugs are walking amongst them.

All I know is I keep hearring that hearrtbeat sound, like...like enerrgy I guess, that and..and back on the station I almost passed out frrom something and feelings and..just everrything, like i could hearr everryone at once..and then those things that werre laying on me when we crrashed! they moved!

She sighs "I don't underrstand what's happeneing, but..but I know that hearring the Jedi when they werre farr happened beforre, I would contact my fatherr when I was meditating sometimes in the forrest."
She looks at him and takes his hand in hers, her thumb running over his hand gently "Maybe he's letting you go, because he knows something? orr maybe he trrusts you like I do" she smiles at him as she speaks, one hand moving to cup his cheek gently.

It seems that I was a deserter to the Remnant? And what's more, people may not trust me because medically I checked out ok. It seems like we are at a milestone in our lives, we have to keep our heads on straight. I think I can do that with you by my side."

He walks into the dusty store as the wind sweeps his fur. The store seems quite small, with junk littered throughout, it seemed poorly kept. The material of the building seems to be hardened sand, like the rest of buildings in the settlement. A female sullustan is sweeping the floor when she spots Woroken.
She approaches Woroken and speaks in basic.

Rith looks down at the floor, as if he was picking up his thoughts. Then he looks back up and gazes at Awne.
Rith: "You know, when you saw me at the Bantha Track's, before we came over here. I could almost feel my memory coming back. You kind of disturbed me, and that's why I seemed distant. I felt like I could almost see my thoughts in front of me, but they kept pushing away. I don't know what's wrong with me. Medically, they can't prove anything IS wrong with me.

The wookie glances around the dusty shop, looking at the chaotic arrangement of the mass of items. "Hopefully Weebus has a filing system," he snorted to himself.
He was snapped back to attention at the sound of whom he presumed was Weebus. First, he decided to try shriwook to see if there was any understanding between the two. "Hello, Weebus, I have a spear that I need repaired, and it seemed as if you might be the best person to help around these parts."

In Weebus's shop, she welcomes Woroken's business whole heartedly.
Weebus: "If I can't fix it, then it's no broken. Let me see that."

Trying to regain Weebus's focus, the wookiee loudly announces, "Here are the 50 truguts, Weebus. How long before the spear is repaired?"
*I'll deduct 50 from Woro…*

After handing over the truguts and the broken spear, Woro realized that when he first saw Ordenn, she was speaking with Radon. "Hmm, wonder if she has any knowledge of his whereabouts..." he thought, deciding to try and engage her in conversation once she concluded her business with Weebus. He walked nonchalantly about the shop, looking at the various inventory strewn about the shelves.

After picking up the fact that Ordenn was not being completely truthful, the wookiee was intrigued.

On the other side of the settlement, Keth enters the Racer's Bend cantina. He can quickly observe that there is someone hosting a gambling event. It seems people are beginning to place bets for the charity podrace in two days. Keth can see there are various types of spacers, merchants, mercenaries, and thugs here. There are multitude of different races. At the right corner of the cantina, a sabacc tournament seems to be going on. You hear a soft beat similar to galactic blues emanating from a sound machine, it gives you the urge to just have a drink and be sociable. Most notably in the cantina, there seems to be blaster-wielding thugs questioning people. The human bartender does not seem to pay any mind that weapons are brandished, nor does anyone else. Perhaps it was a testament of the level of control these thugs had in the area.

> Rith agrees with the officer and then follows Awne.

*Hadru waits for Rith to leave, and turns to Lt. Frelzor instead of leaving the room*
**Hadru**,"I didn't know that he attempted to murder someone. My statement was naive, since I don't really know anyone I shouldn't be defending them, but it does seem odd to me that Rith is allowed to stay with Red Team. If he is a dangerous person or danger to the team I wonder why he is still around, there must be more to his story then anyone is telling."
> The officer watches Hadru after talking to him and watches with concern.
> Lt.Frelzor: &quot;You seem like a good kid, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not advisable to let someone in this young. Especially without parental consent.&quot;

*Hadru listens to the Lt. Frelzor and looks at the Lieutenant with serious eyes, there is some emotion behind them as if he wants to ask the Lieutenant something but is holding back. Hadru thinks to when his "father" gave him the scarf he is wears; now dirty from scouting missions. It was a graduating symbol, but most importantly it was given to him by his "father". He has learned how to survive, how to make hard choices, and take responsibility for his actions. More than some men are capable, and this man stood in front of him knowing nothing and judging him by his appearance. He felt like he was starting all over again, and it sickened him that he had no reservations for adding any of the others, except Rith. Hadru accepted the Lieutenants reservations toward him, but Hadru wondered why the Lieutenant had none for the others.*
**Hadru speaks plainly hiding his emotion**,"If you feel that I can't handle the assignment I understand. My parents can not give me consent Lieutenant, because I don't have any. I would rather not talk about my family, but know that if I don't get work from you I will find it by any means to survive. You seem like your a good guy Lieutenant, but maybe I should use my better judgment and wait to see what this faction of yours is all about."
*Hadru bids a respectful nod goodbye, and this time leaves the room feeling that its best to wait then join a faction he knows nothing about.*
> &quot;Hey kid.&quot; &quot;I thought you would be in there learning all you could about what is at stake.&quot; Vor&#39;en looks at Hadru. &quot;If your worried about the Hutt don&#39;t Most of the guys he will send after you will be second class at best.&quot;
> &quot;Just being around us has brought you more trouble then a Hutt can dish out.&quot; Looking at Hardu equipment Vor&#39;en kind of shakes his head. &quot;I might want to find something with a little more bite then those sporting models you got.&quot; &quot; Maybe we can fiond you something along the way.&quot;

**Hadru replies to Vor'en**,"I think I learned what I need to know, and it turns out I know nothing of there faction and what they represent , so I'm waiting. Anyways, the Lieutenant thinks I'm too young, something that it would be against there better judgment to allow me join."
> Keth turns to Vor&#39;en, &quot;Don&#39;t knock the sporting models, those of us that need to use cover can use them quite well. Granted they don&#39;t punch as hard but aiming with a scope can be quite beneficial&#8230;&quot;

*Hadru grins and watches as Keth defends his weaponry against Vor'en's criticism.*
*Hadru shrugs to Vor'en's criticisms innocently.*
**Hadru**,"You work with what you got, they get the job done from long distances. I don't like to get to close to the action if I can help it."

Vor'en stops and grabs his comlink. "Rith I figured you had your hands full at the moment." "I was thinking about following up on what we are supposed to be doing for our new friends." "If you are not to busy that is."
After finishing his statement Vor'en sees a Jawa looking rather up set and walking away from Anwe. "What is going on Anwe?" "Has something come up?"
Vor'en notices that she is upset also. As she cureses at the Jawa she moves away from NR offices.Stopping next to a wall she says something to someone behind Vor'en. He turns to see Rith standing behind him moving toward Anwe. There talk seems to be going well.
Vore'n steps in between them. " I might suggest that you to figure out what is happening and solve it fast." " We don't have time for this stuff."
"We need to get our minds focused on the job at hand." "Lets go see what we can find out about this guy we are looking for."

Vor'en looks at his to friends, he realizes that they both care for one another, but it is complaicated. Alittle more so then most.
"Anwe you go see what Woro is up to." "Rith you come with me to find out where Hadur went." "When you find Woro and the rest call me and we will meet up some where." "Ok lets get moving, and keep an eye out for our friends from last night we don't need there involement in this."

Just then, the same Jawa that Awne met earlier approaches you. This time he has a fit-looking human with him, he is dressed in typical desert clothing. The human greets everyone standing outside of the embassy.

Ian: "His name is Tipett. He's been equally frustrated lately, he tried to join the bazaar in town, but the Republic guards wouldn't allow him to set up due his inventory. He was forced to due business beyond the city walls and he was wondering if you'd like to check out his wares. He has droid parts, weapons, starship parts and so forth. Him and his clan set up a stand not far from the city walls."

Awne couldn't help it, really when you see a giant wookiee pantomiming something that..what was it a light? sword? something, it was pretty funny; she startled to chuckle, and with a grin she took out her comlink, she got that much. She didn't have the officer's comlink but she did have the jedi's so that must have been it. "You want to talk to the Jedi rright?" she dialed the frequency and handed him her comlink, he wanted to talk to them, after all she didn't understand him yet and the Jedi seemed to so best thing to do was let him talk.

Lorhas: "Great job Woroken. I had a feeling the package made it here. Keep up the good work and you guys stick together. Kel-Yun out..."
Tipett pays no attention as he trudges through the sand, passing through the thinning crowd as you near the city gates. Domed-buildings flank you on the left and right, and it appears you are walking close to a clearing that seems to be a road. Speeders float past you as they are heading to the gates as well. The hovering action of the speeders blows sand and whips your clothes around. You pass the medical facility you were at two nights before, and it seems nothing has changed with it.
After about eighty-two meters, you arrive at the giant archway you passed through on your first arrival here. Two Republic guards flank the entrance, and they wave to you as you exit the establishment. Once beyond the city walls, the Jawa looks at the expansive desert. Mountains can be seen in the far distance, but they look more like mountains of sand. The Jawa walks off the roadway and begins heading southeast. You travel through the empty desert for about one hundred and eleven meters. You go over a humongous dune and end up in a sort of basin, the wind whipping fairly hard here. It seems rocks are more prevalent here but not in this little basin. *It's now 4:11 pm.* You've walked for some distance and you can't see over the next dune which is a good distance away.

*Hadru's been with the team, but hasn't been able to get a word in edge wise it seems like this group likes to talk a lot about everything. Hadru gives an agreeing nod when Rith explains the Hutts knowing about Hardu. Hadru doesn't say anything, He was thinking how the New Republic officers graciously offered for him to join them, but he still didn't want to join a group he knew nothing about. Hadru was cautious that way, it was his survival instincts that told him not to jump into anything before knowing what your getting yourself into. Hadru was mostly watching his companions as they tried to come up with a plan, and he was suspicious of the Jawa; he sensed a trap. His Shirrywook was getting better, but he still couldn't understand Woro and Jawa speak was beyond him. Hadru thought a protocol droid would be very helpful for his friends and himself, but he didn't have enough credits to shop around for one, and even if he did he knew it would need work and that wasn't his specialty.*

Hadru looks among his new companions in shock as he cannot determine where the enemy is as blaster bolts pour down from what seems like the left and right side of the dunes. One blaster bolt dangerously whizzes past Awne's chest and misses. The Jawa runs straight forward up the dune hills, he gets about ten squares in front of the group. He is frantically trudging up the dune to get away from the blaster fire.

As Woroken is looking, a bolt scours past his thigh. *Woroken suffers 15 damage.* Yet another blaster bolt strikes Awne, skimming past her foot. The blaster bolts were getting too close, and the pain was real. *Awne suffers 15 dmg.*

Hadru realizes that there is a rock jutting out from the sand at the beginning of the slope. It should offer protection from the assailants on the right slope, but no protection against the attack on the left. He moves to the right, just beginning to move up the steep slope. *(3 Square movement total, you are now on difficult terrain.)* He starts to catch his breath as he realizes that the attackers are shooting down from the top of the dunes to the left and right of the basin they are in. He draws his sporting blaster rifle and prepares for battle.
Immediately after Hadru takes action, Rith drops to a prone position reaching for his small hold-out blaster that the party allowed him to have.
Rith: "AMBUSH!!!! What do we do Vor'en?"
Rith uses his small blaster and points in the direction of the left slope, firing at the only visible attacker behind the rocks. Rith sees a blaster bolt strike the attacker.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-02-20 18:01:32)

Awne drops right next to Rith, immediately training her weapon on the attacker looking over the rocks on the slope. She fires and the bolt impacts on the rock, the attacker quickly takes cover again. Awne and Rith's combined fire seems to have kept the heads down of the shooters on the left. But as this happens, a hail of blaster fire comes from the right.
A bolt scours past Vor'en's thigh burning him immensely. *Vor'en takes 13 damage.* The attacker you already saw on the right pops up again and fires at Woroken. You notice the rifle he is carrying has a scope on it. The assailant has ragged clothing that is old and torn with a bandolier. The bolt travels from his rifle and grazes Woroken's shoulder. *Woroken takes 12 damage.* A blaster shot lands in the sand next to Rith's back, the person who fired from the right is spotted. He quickly takes cover when Red Team notices him.
Vor'en uses a boost of energy and begins rushing up the right slope. He can feel sand and sweat beginning to build in his clothes, but he realizes he must overcome the fatigue to stop this enemy. *You are now 19 squares away from the right rock emplacement.*
Woroken dashes to cover at the beginning of the left slope, he kneels behind the rock pulling out his hold-out blaster.
As this happens, a stream of blaster fire grazes Awne and Rith. The sand kicks up and they feel the burning of blaster bolts grazing them. *Awne and Rith each take nine damage.* Then after that burst of fire, a bolt lands harmlessly next to Rith. A sand cloud kicks up in front of Awne's face. Obviously, the attackers saw Rith and Awne as a nice area target to shoot at, yet they weren't hitting as effectively as they should. Woroken begins looking for targets, and hears a bolt snap on the rock he was hiding behind.
*Each character made a Perception check as a reaction due to the enemies firing and taking cover. Only these characters can see all the targets on the right slope; Vor'en and Hadru. Rith has spotted all the attackers on the left and right. These characters can engage these targets freely. The rest can only see two on the right and one on the left.* 
As the fight rages on, the Jawa continues to dash up hill, almost reaching even ground. *He is almost out of sight, 32 squares away. It appears as if he will be over the dune beyond your sight.* 
Rith screams to Red Team.
Rith: "Suppress each of those three targets on the right slope! Let Vor'en close on them!"
Hadru responds to Rith by immediately opening a barrage of blaster bolts toward the rock position on the right slope. The bolts pound the rock and whiz past it relentlessly, you can see one shooter quickly get and stay in cover. Everyone in Red Team manages to spot all three attackers behind the rock on the right slope, thanks to Hadru giving away their position.
Rith digs his feet into the ground for support, wiping the sand out of his eyes. He watches the bolts striking the right rock as the assailants peek over it periodically, waiting for a clear shot. Rith fires four blaster bolts at a sustained rate, to add to Hadru's suppressing fire. *Two attackers on the right slope are now effectively suppressed.*
Awne rallies behind her companions, blowing the sand out of her eyes. She aims in the general vicinity of the rock on the slope and shoots four shots. *Every attacker is suppressed behind the rock.*
Vor'en is closing on the rock emplacement. He can see his friendly fire on his side traveling to suppress the enemy. He quickly notices that all three people are attacking less now. One of the enemies notices Vor'en approaching and quickly pops up to fire, he shoots and the bolt goes wide...missing the old soldier as he charges. The second one goes to the right of the rock, just barely poking his weapon out. He shoots and misses horribly. After that, A rifle pokes over the top and fires a burst of blaster bolts. A few bolts graze Vor'en right side, burning him alongside his body. *Vor'en takes six damage.*
Vor'en stops and looks up at the steep slope for a second, using the suppression to get a good idea where the enemy is. He watches as all three pop out from every side of the rock, immediately Vor'en brings his E-11 to eye level and lets off ten rounds of automatic fire. A few bolts strike the attackers and they yelp in pain, retreating back to cover.
Woroken watches his friends in battle as they lay fire down on the right slope. Woroken figures he needs to attack the left slope. He brings his sights up as he rests his bowcaster in his shoulder, he can see the mass of the attacker fill his sights as he squeezes the trigger. A powerful bolt quickly travels to its target, and collides into one of the attackers chest with a tremendous thud. Woroken observes that a hole was blown clean into the shooter's chest as he slumps to the side of the rock, dropping his rifle. Woroken hears a voice behind the rock.
Voice: "I can't believe we lost one!"
After Woro's attack, he can see the thugs appear over the top of the rock, aiming their rifles in. One of the assailants shoots at Woroken, and the blast scrapes his shoulder. Woroken can feel an immense burning sensation. *Woroken takes 13 damage.* Woroken watches as one of them fires at Rith. The bolt strikes him square in the bicep, and he writhes in pain. The third attacker takes a shot at Awne, and the bolt lands harmlessly in the sand next to her.
As the firefight ensues, the Jawa fumbles over the top of the dune to the front of your formation. He is now out of sight. All the attackers are now visible to Red Team.
Hadru brings his blaster rifle up, carefully aiming in to one of the men on the right slope. He shoots and a laser blast hits an assailant in the top-right of his chest, he crumples over and you can no longer see him past the rock.
Rith does his best to ignore the burning pain in his bicep as he fires his hold-out blaster. The bolt misses the rock and the attacker completely. He shouts, "I'm out of ammo, reloading!"
Awne carefully aligns her pistol sights on the attacker who is constantly peeking over the rocks, she fires and strikes him in the stomach. The Twi'lek collapses into the sand, almost on top of his other dead companion.
Vor'en watches the rock formation on top of the right slope intently, waiting for the next enemy to pop up. He has almost reached the position where the enemy was causing so much chaos from. It happens so surreal, a human attacker jumps up from cover and shoots right at Vor'en. A bolt strikes him in the kneecap as his body grows weary from this heinous attack. *Vor'en takes 9 damage.*
Vor'en grimaces in pain, but he channels this energy and raises his E-11 up just enough to let off a ten round burst. The blaster bolts pound the human all over his body relentlessly, and he collapses over. Vor'en is almost positive he is dead, and he can see no more enemies in the right rock emplacement.
The team notices after everyone has been dropped on the right, they shift their attention to the left slope. An attacker jumps up and engages Woroken, he fires a bolt and it goes wide, landing next to the Wookiee. A green skinned attacker fires at Awne, the bolt landing between her and Rith. The third assailant shoots and hits Hadru in the arm. *Hadru suffers eight damage.*
*It only costs 1 swift to get a Second Wind. Hadru recovers 13 hp.*
Hadru peeks over the rock just enough to shoot at one of the attackers on the left slope. He fires and hits his opponent, though he can't exactly see where. The opponent grabs cover again.
Rith quickly reaches into his utility belt and grabs a energy cell. He slaps it into his small blaster and charges his weapon. He fires at the opponent that Hadru just hit. The bolt whizzes past the attacker as he goes back down for cover.
Awne moves her pistol sights to the next opponent she can see, it appears to be the one that Hadru hit. She holds her hand steady and slowly squeezes the trigger, the bolt travels from the barrel and strikes the person square in the stomach. He topples over behind the rock.
Vor'en unslings his KX-60 blaster rifle and fires quickly at the left slope rock emplacement. One of the blaster bolts appear to strike a target, but he is unsure at this distance how much damage it has done.
Woroken takes careful aim towards the left slope, looking for a figure. He spots an assailant and shoots...missing completely. The assailant catches Woroken and fires back, the bolt grazing over Woroken's shoulder, dangerously close to his neck. *Woroken takes nine damage.* Another attacker comes from the right side of the rock and fires at Awne, the bolt lands harmlessly in the sand in front of her.
Hadru spots these two attackers and aims at the one on the right. He fires and misses horribly.
Rith moves and begins climbing up the large dune after the escaped Jawa.
Awne steadies her breath to fire at the targets behind the rock, she views a body and sneezes on some dust. She fires and misses completely.
The group hears someone shouting over on the left slope. "Wait for my signal!"
Back towards the right slope, Vor'en drops to the prone and points his rifle toward the left rock emplacement. He fires at a figure that he can vaguely see. He bolt travels through the air and quickly hits one of the opponents. The people in the basin can see the attacker fall over.

Woroken ducks behind the closest cover, trying to get his wits about him. He had taken two direct hits and needed to get out of the line of fire. After getting to cover, he pulls his bowcaster and prepares to defend himself against the onslought.
*If there is cover, he will duck behind it. If not, he will lay prone on the ground and pull his pistol.*

Woroken moves up the steep slope steadily. He gets toward the rocky area on top of the slope with his bowcaster raised, he can smell the smoke from hot blaster rifles. He walks over past the rock where the assailants were at, and he sees four people laying on the ground. They have smoldering blaster holes throughout each of their bodies, and they are in very shabby clothing with bandoliers. They don't seem to be moving, and Woroken checks all of their vital signs after watching them for a few seconds. They are all dead. The people are two human males, a human female who looks to be in her thirties, and a rodian who seems quite young with green skin. There blaster rifles are laying next to their bodies where they dropped them. Frag grenades are propped against the rock where they were taking cover. Woroken can see the Jawa off in the distance walking away, he appears to be about eighty squares away.
Woroken also hears voice coming from all of their bodies, it appears to be a comlink. The speech is in Rodese.

Woroken flops down on the sand dune, exhausted and wounded. He heard that the Lieutenant was on the way in a few short moments. That did nothing to relieve the oppressive heat, so the wookiee unrolled his sunshield roll and placed it over Vor'en, who was still struggling. He nodded at Hadru, who had some skill in treating wounds as well, it appeared.
Woroken was still confused what role the Jawa had in all this, however. He had joined up with the group too late to hear why everyone was following him. Had the Jawa been ambushed too, or was he to lure the Red Team into the thug's trap? He figured Awne could sort everything out.

**Hadru**,"You have a talent for healing big guy. I never did get a chance to introduce myself. I am Hadru, glad to meet you."
*As Awne runs off Hadru shakes his head disapprovingly, then he looks at Woro and speaks*

*Hadru wonders if Rith is going to be a liability being so rash, look where it got Vor'en he thinks to himself.* 
*Hadru let's Woro finish the treatment, he gets close to Vor'en as he sees he is trying to say something. Hardu puts his ear very close to listen to his mumbled incoherent whispered words. Then he raises his head and looks at Woro with a chuckle.*

Woroken offers his hand to Hadru. He could already tell he liked the young human. Hadru seemed to be much more in line with the wookiee's temperment. Also, Woroken was happy to have another person around who knew his way around bacta and synthflesh. He knew from experience it was much harder to treat your own wounds.
Woroken next looked around for the Lieutenant's caravan, as the time was passing. He certainly did n't want to walk all the way back to town, as he was a little light headed from the shots he had taken during the battle.

Awne runs quickly to Rith as he chases after the Jawa. Awne can see in the distance that the Jawa is getting out of sight and realizes they may not be able to catch him. She catches up to Rith and she stops him. Rith looks at Awne desperately, looking as if he really wanted to catch the Jawa. Awne notices little tracks in the sand however, they appear to be the Jawa's footprints. If you wanted to track him this would be the best way. Off in the distance, you can hear the humming and hissing of landspeeders. You no doubt assume that is the New Republic Medical team.

After a few moments, two tan colored XP-38 landspeeders arrive in your area. The speeders whip sand and dust around all over you. The wind blows your clothes and the dust makes it difficult to see. The speeders are quickly turned off. A Republic soldier clad in desert stripe camoflague and tan armor walks toward you with his rifle at the ready.The soldier is followed closely by the young Jedi, Feldon. The dirty-blonde youth bows to your group and speaks.
Feldon: "What is the status of your wounded, are they all ambulatory?"

Feldon: "You need to find a Jawa? He's the one responsible for this? Well, you cannot use our assistance. The New Republic is trying to remain low key on Tatooine as of right now. We have to avoid any formal incarcerations or interrogations, you'll have to act on the Jawa independently of the Republic. We wouldn't want to stir up local trouble for the Republic. However, you can use the scanner on this speeder to locate any life forms around. Are you fit to go after this Jawa? After all, you look like you need medical attention. But considering the circumstances, you might need to chase the little one now."

Awne slides in the front seat next to Feldon. She types in a few commands to bring up a sensor sweep. On the display, she can see a grouping of slow moving life forms about 300 meters south. Even shorter than that, is a weak signal of a life form 150 meters southeast. She doesn't pick up any energy signals other than the adjacent landspeeder that the soldier was piloting.

Awne frowns at the sensor, 300 yards would be too far for the jawa to have gone so quickly, it had to be the one closer. However to be sure, she closes her eyes and breathes slowly returning to her training to calm her nerves and determine the proper target.

The two speeders power up and head towards Mos Esre with Vor'en and Woroken. After the noise and sand settles, you once again hear the quiet ambient sounds of the desert. The suns are near setting, which will make it more difficult to track the Jawa soon. Hadru begins leading the group towards the tracks past the basin where you were ambushed. He quickly notices that the small Jawa tracks are difficult to see. He moves quite slowly to accurately follow the tracks.

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-03 06:54:12)

Woroken and Vor'en breathe a sigh of relief as they finally can relax in the back of the landspeeder. In a very short amount of time, you are passing back through the Mos Esre archway. The flanking Republic soldiers at the gate nod in respect to the returning transports. The speeders move through the slightly populated area next to the gate, and in about thirty seconds the speeders veer to the left. This is the direction of the Embassy. The speeders hover slowly to the back area of the Embassy next to the giant wall that encases the whole settlement. You can see other speeders parked here awaiting use. Feldon powers down the ship and so does the adjacent transport with the Republic soldier.
Feldon walks through the rear doorway with his comlink in hand, telling the staff to prepare for the arrival of patients. The cool air as you walk through the door is viciously welcoming. You walk through the familiar halls of the Embassy as your feet clank off the metallic grating. In seconds you are in the space constrained medical room. There is a bacta tank at the end of the room, and flanking beds that are embedded in the walls. You can see numerous white plasteel containers that no doubt hold medical supplies. The two other Republic medical personnel begin loosening Vor'en's clothing, and they put both of your more cumbersome gear to the side. The personnel grunt as all three assist to put Woroken into the medical beds. After everyone is bedded down, they begin plugging tubes into the arms of Vor'en and Woroken.
They slide large machines over that hum and whir with power as they pump nutritional water into your bodies. Each of you feel the cool soft material of the smooth bed as you lay your head down, beginning to feel better already. Feldon asks each of you where you are injured.

Feldon chuckles at this and then becomes serious. He closes his eyes and holds his hand over Woroken's forehead. After a few seconds, Woroken can feel the pain mystically subsiding in his body. He can also feel the wounds mending at a rapid rate, though not completely. *Woroken restores 12 HP.*
Feldon then relaxes and pulls out a medpac from one of the plasteel bins. He breaks it open and applies synthflesh, along with bacta. He snugly secures the bandage in place where the bacta was applied. *Woroken restores an additional 18 HP.*
The young Jedi stands and smiles.

Within a few moments, Woroken felt practically as good as new. The wookiee was a decent combat medic, but his skills paled at those of the young Jedi. "Thank you, Feldon." Woro was slightly uncomfortable, as he never was good at taking a compliment, especially for something he didn't fully understand. "Your healing skills are amazing. If I get good at the Force, could you teach me that first thing you did?"
He looked around and then asked the Jedi how Vor'en was coming along. He knew the vet was in much worse shape than he was prior to being brought to the med center.

I had never heard anyone could heal without a medpac using it. And I have seen your sister do amazing things with her lightsaber, but that might have just been her own battle skills.
If it's true, and I have some ability in it, I suppose that could explain things in my past. I've sort of had a 'voice in my head' so to speak telling me what to do before. It hasn't happened often, maybe 5 or 6 times in my life, but for instance, I felt I just had to come to the station for the 'safari,' which in turn led me to the planet and to meet you all."

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-03 10:17:08)

Feldon: "That voice you speak of in your head is called the Will of the Force. It's the Force inspiring you to do what it bids. It controls every living being in a sense to do its bidding. Despite what people may think, we are not slaves to the Force. We are working together with it to accomplish our destinies. So you could say the Force has a plan for all of us, and some of us can use the Force more so than others to reach that destiny. And I believe Jedi utilize it solely to help others live well. We cannot be so selfish as to use it for our own reasons, as we have been blessed with this responsibility. My master firmly believes that the Will of the Force has guided all of you together to meet us, for reasons he cannot yet determine."
Feldon takes a moment to pace and then speaks again.
Feldon: "Although I could not see what my master does at first, I'm beginning to see it now. Especially after you all survived that vicious attack, with these wounds most people would have been dead. Though Mur Eva might not believe in you, she can be stubborn at times, but she is unbelievably loyal. She's not really my sister by the way, it's a long story and perhaps I'll tell you about it some other time."

However, anything to do with the crash is strictly Falsoor jurisdiction and we allowed them to take full control of it. They are handing the investigation internally, and as such, they are keeping his equipment as evidence. Yet, if he is identified as being behind the sabotage...he will be turned over to us. So would his equipment, but it would be useless at that point anyways. The Jedi have agreed to take responsibility for Rith, but we can't get you his stuff because it is evidence. I can't do anything to get it back. But what I can do, is issue you equipment when you take your first job.

Feldon places his hand on Vor'en's forehead. Within moments, Vor'en feels a soothing aura filling his body. His wounds begin to rapidly heal. *He regains 6 hp.* Once this is done, Feldon unpacks another med unit and applies the medicine to his injuries. *He gains an additional 11 hp.*
Feldon stands away from Vor'en, he washes his hands from the refresher.
Feldon: "Now, that is the best I can do. You two need bed rest, I trust the others will contact us if they need help?"

Awne smiles at the Jedi as she steps in, a look of relief on her face as she can actually feel her fur cooling...she could swear she could hear a hiss as the cold air hits hot fur. "Hello again Feldon." She grins brighter at the other eyes "Hello boys, feeling betterr?"

Feldon bows politely to Awne.
Feldon: "I see you have the Jawa with you, I trust everything worked out? Your friends are going to be strong enough to wrestle Wampas soon, I wouldn't worry about them. Why don't all of you lay down and we'll get started on those injuries."
Feldon reaches for a medical datapad and pulls out a bacta injector.

Awne looks back at the Jawa "yes..seems he is the rreason those people werre able to ambush us." she looks to Hadru and Rith "let him trreat yourr wounds, and take the time to rrest." She then moves to the old soldiers side and between the wookiees so he could hear her "we should look into a ship..it's time we leave. The hutts arre onto us, it's not safe herre."

*Think Clint Eastwood western style*
"What catastrophe? Are you talking about the crash?"

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 20:59:05)

Rith nods to Xander.
Rith: "That's correct, they were all looking to work for Falsoor until the ship crashed."
Feldon cuts off Rith as he is speaking.
Feldon: "You are not thinking of leaving are you? If you do, you may face the might of the Remnant, which could be far worse than Bordo's local gangsters. Even more than that, my master might have had plans for you all after the completion of this mission. But we can't stop you if that is what you want."

"Hutts." Vor'en says with alittle surprise. "I was wondering when they would get involed." Vor'en look up at Anwe. "I have dealt enuff with them to know that running is not an option." "Don't worry we will deal with what ever they throw at us." Vor'en looks over to Rith. " I tryed son but these wouldn't give up the ghost. Your gear is gone untill we can contact the company that owned the ship we were all shoot down in." "WE have some extra stuff and I will see what can be made of it."

Feldon goes back to what he was saying, pacing the room, checking both patients.

"Yes it is darlin." Vor'en looks at Xander. "He can stay if he will follow orders." "Name is Vor'en I lead this team." Vor'en notices the weapon he is working on. " If you need something to do check the pile of there and see what is serviceable and what isn't Rith here needs some more fire power." Vor'en motions to the weapons piled up from the last bunch of thugs they took down.

Feldon frowns at Xander's question.
Feldon: "I don't have credits to give you in advance, but you get 400 credits per day of assistance."
*The fallen thugs weapons will require maintenance to work properly. Please decide how you are dividing the gear amongst everyone.*
Rith smiles and looks at Xander.
Rith: "We did pick up some truguts from the blaster goons. Think we should give him some for his troubles?"

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-05 21:21:49)

Feldon waits for Awne to crawl into the medical bed and he slowly puts his hand over her forehead. Within moments, she can feel the pain mystically subside in her body. *Awne regains 12 hp.*
After this, he breaks open a medpac and applies bacta to all her wounds, followed by snug bandages. *She gains 14 hp.*
Rith climbs into the medical bed next to Awne and receives treatment shortly after Awne.
Feldon folds his arms and looks at his patients compassionately.
Feldon: "You all need rest, once you wake up...I would advise you plan your next task and then do it. But for now, free your minds of worry and get some sleep. My master and Mur Eva are looking for the spy as we speak, hopefully we can resolve this quickly and not request your labors anymore. I want to see all of you free from the Hutt's reach, especially due to the good deeds you did to get the attention."

### **Frost** (2008-03-05 21:28:47)

Xander walks over to the pile of weapons and starts looking them over. He picks up one and starts fields stripping it. He take out his tool kit and pulls out a cleaning rag and some lube. He starts cleaning the weapon quickly and efficently.
"Man these Echutta didn't take care of thier gear did they. If you have place for me to work I will field strip these and do maintence on them."
To the wook

Rith: "As you know I can't remember my personal past. I have no direction other than that you guys pushed me into. I'm accused of sabotaging a ship and may be placed under arrest if I don't cooperate with the Jedi, it seems my options are very limited.

*Hadru has always been comfortable in the Med bay, but its been awhile since he has been in one as a patient. All those years helping his father, and then the mess of the war brought up memories while he was siting in the Med bay. Hadru quietly listened to everyone, and he welcomed Feldon's aid and care for the night. Knowing that a good nights rest would take care of most of the burns and scratches Hadru excuses himself for a bit and leaves the room. The cool room was refreshing, but Hadru had acclimated to the warm climate of Tatooine and the cool room was actually bothering him. Hadru finds a secure balcony or terrace and watches the twin suns set, with thoughts of his father and the war he left back home Hadru spends some time alone out of the cool air.
After a calming moment to himself Hadru will retire in the Med Bay at 6:30pm*

Xander works hard on the KX-60 blaster rifle and other weapons. However, in eight hours he is only able to get one KX-60 and one DL-18 fully functional. The other six weapons would have to be worked on later or accepted as they were. The KX-60 still had a shattered scope. After Xander completes his work on the KX-60 he goes to sleep.
Awne awakes first with a cold sweat, it is roughly 1:20 am. She has trouble remembering the events that happened just yesterday. The medical bay is empty, the only thing she hears is the beeping and whirring of medical machines.

Awne sits up, shaking and sweating and breathing heavily; 'what the hell happened last night?' she wonders. Looking around and seeing the med bay, she frowns 'why the med bay?' Deciding she needed some air, she scoots from under the covers and hops of the bed, walking quietly outside after a look to make sure Rith was still asleep.
Stepping out into the cool air, she sighs and runs a hand through her hair.

The rest of the group is awakened by Awne leaving the room.
When Awne walks outside, she notices that the streets of Mos Esre are vacant. The moon was out in full set, and the area was well illuminated. It had cooled down substantially and now there was a breeze. One of the Republic guards nods to Awne as he is nonchalantly watching the area.
Guard: "M'aam..."

## Re: Heart of Shadows Campaign (Chapter 3)

### **zerah** (2008-03-06 12:20:28)

Awne's blue eyes glance over to the guard giving him a nod and a slight wave "morrning.." She sighs again and looks up the moon, she always loved the moon. Moonlight seemed so pure and yes a little romantic but she blamed the other female students of her father for that, they were always lending her novels and telling her stories. She smiles at the thought, remembering meditating in her special corner of the forest in a beam of moonlight. She had felt so at peace in that moment, night creatures made music, the moonlight hitting her fur, everything seemed in harmony.
She sighs and opens her eyes, not realising she had closed them while in thought and steps forward into a stray moonbeam, closing her eyes and listens to the sounds of the planet.

Woroken, normallly a heavy sleeper, surprises himself by hearing Awne get up. He looks around to make sure everything is okay, before getting up himself. He could tell it was very early in the morning, but as he went to bed so early, he felt fully refreshed--the best he had felt in days.
It was too early to go get his spear, so he decided to see if anyone else was up. Maybe Feldon or Mur Eva were awake. Woroken gathers his gear before walking out of the med bay to look around.

Woroken takes a look in the long hallway of the Embassy, and as he does, he views Feldon approaching the Med bay. Feldon stops in front of Woroken and bows.
Feldon: "If you would step in so I could finish my examination on everyone, then you'll be free to go."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-06 15:50:43)

Feldon awaits everyone to lay flat in their respective beds, once they do, he types a few commands in the medicomputer on the wall. A low hum begins on the ceiling over your bed, a laser beam scans your body quickly.
You can hear Feldon type a few more commands.
Feldon: "Hmm, that's strange. Everyone seems to be in excellent condition. Awne has no feedback that suggests she would lose her memory."
Rith climbs out of bed at the mention of this.
Rith: "Well Doc, it sounds similar to my situation."
Feldon: "Yes it does indeed, I'll need more time to look into this. I'll notify my master. Are all of you going to continue working for us?"

Feldon smiles to Woroken's response.
Feldon: "And even if you all decide to continue your services, what made you all visit the Telares station? Why did you choose to help us in the first place? From what I've noticed you all have no prior allegiances, you all just seemed to gather naturally. My master believes the Force gathered you together. I even sense the Force strong in Xander."

"Well, Awne, Vor'en and myself were thrown together by random assignment. We picked Rith up on the way, getting out of the shuttle. The others have been picked up here and there through random chance. Or at least it seemed like random chance," Woroken laughed. "The Force is as good a guess as any how all the random events transpired."

Feldon: "I assume that random assignment was the Great Falsoor hunt right? You were together in this effort until you got here, and then we chose to enlist your aid. But why did you accept servicing us? You could have fled, presumably be in less danger than you are now. I'm not sure you really want to see Rast brought to the Republic. I want to hear everyone's feelings toward this, if you don't mind. What brought you all to Telares and what drove you to serve us?"

Feldon: "Yes, his name is Rast Drowen. He is a defected Remnant Communications Officer that might have great knowledge of how the Remnant operates. We weren't sure if this was a trap or not, but that's why they sent us to handle it. This mission was not be to be on record. The reason why we were assigned this job is that Corlen Doris, the headmaster of Telares Station, knew my master and had worked to keep Rast safe until we arrived at the station. This group ran into him and found out that he had to leave for reasons we suspect had to do with the Star Destroyer in orbit. They may have been spotted with Rast so their safety could be compromised, either by bounty hunters or Imperial agents. We most definitely need to protect him."

Rith paces around the room next to Feldon.
Rith: "That all sounds good, and I know I'm lucky to get a second chance thanks to you guys, but we won't be able to do much searching with these gangsters after us."
Feldon: "Yes, we'll have to come up with a plan if we are going to do anything with you all further. At the minimum I'd say you'd have to stick together and keep a low profile for a few days. In fact, since most of you started working with the Republic, I heard that the Lieutenant's job operates way beyond the outskirts. It would be an optimal way to keep you guys close yet out of danger, letting you guys line your pockets. Or I imagine you could continue the hunt under a disguise."

Ordenn told me that she gave a ride planetside to Rath/Orwen. That was the message I communicated to Lorhas before we went out to follow the Jawa. I forgot that I didn't tell the group that."

Rith looks at Feldon and speaks.
Rith: "You might want to have the other Jedi ask around about that."
Feldon: "Yes, I'll have them ask about that. Hopefully the Remnant stays out of here, so that would give a high probability that Rast is still here."

Rith counters Awne's statement.
Rith: "It's likely he is in this settlement, but we would be severely hindered to assist the Jedi here due to the fact that we angered the militia. I believe we should take this Republic job and see where it leads us, and perhaps we could find more information while getting paid. We won't do anyone good here if we get killed. We won't be sought out as much somewhere else, but while we stand here it might as well be a gundark's nest."
Feldon nods his head.
Feldon: "Frelzor did mention that the mayor's contract involved work outside of Mos Esre. Rast did land here, but it is possible he left. What would you all like to do?"

Rith looks to the rest of the group.

Feldon promptly leaves the medical room. Rith looks to the equipment.
Rith: "I say we divide up the gear and go get something to eat. We can plan our next move over some food. I want that repaired DL-18 if you don't mind, I'm carrying the weakest blaster of the group."

*When Hadru wakes up he is a bit sore, and his stomach still aches from the blaster burns from the dune skrimish. He considers using his last medpac, but figures a few more nights rest will heal him you can see he is uncomfortable. Hadru watches as his new companions discuss future actions in the Medical Bay and suggest we all go to the mess hall for breakfast. He sometimes picks up words Woro says, and tries to keep up with the Shyriwook speak, but most words still elude him. This bounty on Rath (a.k.a Orwen) has perked Hadru's attention, and it could have well been a job offered by any of the scoundrel types that populate Mos Esre. He realizes the dangers are going to be greater than he first anticipated.*
*Hadru looks at Rith when he says he would not be noticed, it seemed odd to Hadru that he would say something like that if he was suffering amnesia. How could he know or assume to know if anyone would or would not recognize him if he himself doesn't even remember. Hadru was about to speak, but thought it better to keep his words to himself.*
**Hadru**,"If I was being hunted and needed to lay low then I would head for the desert, unless I knew someone that would hide me out. I suspect Rath has done the same. The only person we know Rath spoke with was this pilot Ordenn which Woro ran into at Weebus's shop in the marketplace. Ordenn may be able to help, if she took him down here Rath may contact her to take him somewhere again. If we can gain her trust we may gain another set of eyes and ears to help our mission."

*You initially repaired the DL-18 Xander, then the KX-60. State how you are all distributing the gear and money. Rith will take the fixed DL-18. Hadru you recovered 24 hp in addition to long term care.*
Rith nods to Hadru.
Rith: "I suppose we'll get a chance to search the desert a bit when we leave this settlement."
Rith moves with the group to the mess hall. You all move left outside of the med bay and walk down a few feet. You pass through a door to an expansive room with two long tables and benches. A cleaning droid is sanisteaming the floor at the moment, and in the very back you can see what appears to be the kitchen. No food seems to be left out. Rith walks back to the kitchen. One soldier is quickly finishing up his food at the farthest table, and you suspect he has some pressing duties.
Rith: "Hmm, seems they only have rations out for Dewback stew and water. Let me prepare this for you."

"Interesting," Woroken thinks as he listens to Xander's thoughts. The wookiee passes the bowcaster to the mechanic, nodding his head at the offer.

Back home when she was a kitten she had refused to eat most meats but after leaving had realised that the rest of the galaxy wasn't like her; and had developed a taste for meats like a 'normal Farghul' as one spacer had said.

Rith smiles at Awne.
Rith: "I suggest we go to Weebus's shop and see the deals he has on speeders there. But I would even go so far to borrow one from the Republic, we are working for them anyways."
Rith then looks at his chrono.
Rith: "We've got some time, I'd say we should get some more rest after we are done eating."
At that time, Lt. Frelzor walks in.
Lt. Frelzor: "Hi everyone, I heard you'll be taking that job tommorow? I need to do some things quickly if you all have a moment."

Awne smiles at Rith, and finishes her greens, kissing his cheek again. "Well we should look into a speederr of ourr own, and we can ask the Rrepublic if it's too much forr one of ourr own."
She pushes her plate away a little and leans against the imperial slightly, with a sigh "rresting forr a while longerr sounds nice."
At the voice she looks up, only to return her head to laying on Rith's shoulder.

Woroken watches Red Team all doing their individual tasks, and decides to leave them to their own devices. He stand up and walks to an empty corner of the mess hall. He was slightly embarrassed to be seen as he decided to try something. He thought about Feldon and the healing he did with his hands, purportedly "using the Force." Feldon had told him, he had the Force inside of him as well. Realizing he had absolutely no idea of what he was doing, the wookiee sat down, placed his hands on himself, mimicking the Jedi earlier, and closed his eyes, attempting to concentrate on healing. He was not surprised when nothing happened.

Lieutenant Frelzor looks at Xander.
Lt.: "Someone new I see? Well I'll need everyone's indentichip that joined. It'll give you military grade identification and will allow others to recognize you as a New Republic agent. If you are still wanting to take that job you will have visit the mayor at 9 am, that is when she goes into her office."

**Hadru to Woro**,"Woro, I'm catching some of your words but I can't understand everything, maybe we can use a data pad like you did with Awne. Just in case we come across something important. I need to check and see if everyone is properly equipped to travel in the desert, that will give me a good understanding of what kind of supplies will be needed for the expedition. If the Republic will equip us with some items then it would be good to find out before we go buying stuff at Weebus's. If we can't get field kits then plenty of water, food, and all-temperature cloaks should suffice. Let me speak with Lt. Frelzor before we leave."
*Hadru is very prepared, and it seems like this isn't the first time he's been out in dune seas of Tattoonie.*

Red Team finishes up their meal and conversation. The officer leaves the mess hall with identichips in hand. The group goes back to the med bay and crawls back into the medical beds. Within moments, due to exhaustion and full stomachs, the group falls asleep. Awne is a bit restless but manages to catch sleep. She awakes a few times throughout the night. In a more humorous tone, she doesn't know if her memory problems or Woro's snoring kept her up the most.
At about 8 am, the bright lights to the med bay pierce everyone's closed eyelids, and everyone slowly begins gathering their bearings as they wake up.

Lorhas then recommended you all continue to stick together, as you are still in danger. He advised that you take the New Republic mission and do what you can for Rast somewhere else. I also told him of your condition and Rith's, he told me to keep studying it medically. Once we get to the Jedi Academy we will have someone look into it to see if it has something to do with the Force. Mostly because, my master feels a discreet disturbance in the Force."

You all walk a short distance through the halls of the Embassy to the Armory. In the armory, you can see a counter set up with a vid display embedded on the top of it. Behind the desk, is narrowed walls with durasteel equipment racks parallel to each other. At the end of the room, crates are stacked upon each other. Various types of blasters are stored in these racks, some weapons you can't identify very well. You notice some Republic armor suits next to the crates. The room is quite small for an armory, and you imagine the equipment here is for the skeleton duty that the Republic hosts here.
A middle-aged black-haired woman in a New Republic uniform greets you.
Woman: "Can I help you?"

Woroken hands over the 75 truguts and takes back his identichip and quarrels. She was right, as bowcaster ammo was reasonably tough to find. That is why he didn't complain about the expensive price.

Xander pulls out his datapad on the way to supply. He shows it to Woro and Hadru. It contains several scetches and scematics.
"Here is my idea for your langauge barrier. I need a simple droid brain and a translator unit. I then wire them together inside your vox-box. The brain uses the translator to understand what you say and turn it into basic and then it relpays it through the vox. That way we can understand you and don't have to worry about some slow ass protocol droid following you around. Using a simple brain rather than a heuristic processor will negate any chance of it developing a personality or doing much more than repeating what you say into basic. What do you think?"

Interesting using simple droid parts to make a translater, maybe a small droid with a repulsar locomotion could make things even easier, sort of like an remote droid."

*DW, I will leave the rifle in the sick bay with the others.*
Woroken walks with the two humans toward th supply room. His interest had been piqued by the inventive human. He wondered if the modified vox box could actually work. He also noticed the clear uneasiness of Hadru when the sandstorm was mentioned. Woroken had never been in a bad storm like that, but he had heard tales of how dangerous they were.

The supply room is just next door, and as you walk through it, a cargo droid is pushing heavy items into the room. A bipedal droid with white plating greets you at a room that looks very similar to the armory.
Droid: "What can I assist you with? I trust you are all in the Republic?"

They are five minutes away, by the time I reach there on foot the battle will be over or they will be dead.

Feldon:"Master, I have an urgent transmission from the headmaster, Corlen Doris."
Lorhas: "Hmm, we are a little preoccupied, what's it about?"
Feldon: "He claims to have more information about Rast."
Lorhas: "Relay his transmission to my comlink."
Feldon: "Yes master."
You hear the whirring of the comlink as it attempts to receive a new signal, then a man's voice can be heard.
Doris: "Master Lorhas, how is your search?"
Lorhas: "We had a lead, but we encountered a complication."
Doris: "I must make this transmission brief, they are there looking for him, but they won't come near your location. There is too much presence of another faction."
The comlink signs off and Lorhas seems like he has much to think about.

The Jedi Master looks to Mur Eva as everyone works their way through the crowd.
Lorhas: "I believe the information we got and the conclusion I derived was accurate, due to Bordo the Hutt's control, the Remnant has decided to stay out of this area."
Mur Eva: "I agree Master, but just because they won't do a formal show of force, doesn't mean there aren't Remnant agents and bounty hunters."
Lorhas: "Very true, but it's likely since Rast landed here, if Woroken's lead was correct...that he is hiding here because it is the most logical choice of action to avoid detection."
Mur Eva: "So hopefully he stays in the area."
Lorhas: "Yes, but when will he come to us?"
Mur Eva: "When he feels it is safe enough?"
Lorhas: "Well, I'm not sure what's happening...but we need to focus on saving our comrades in need for the time being."

Although the wookiee wasn't sure of the location of the ambush site, he had been able to tell that it was in the northeast part of the area.

People are moving throughout the various streets, alleys, and buildings in the residential area. It seems that you cannot tell an attack even happened recently. You see the usual blaster rifle toting men walking as if they owned the settlement. They seem to pay no attention to you. The Jedi try to walk as nonchalant as possible, looking as if they were engaged in conversation. However, in reality, they were discreetly talking about Rast. The gist of the conversation seems to be that it's too dangerous to contact them now, and that he would likely show up in a heavily crowded area when he is ready.
As you look at the crowded sections of houses, you begin to become discouraged. It would seem there is nothing to point you in the right direction of your friends.

[OOC: I wasn't trying to find the person who I thought would have the most information, I was scoping the scene to find out if I could find someone that Hadru could most relate with and maybe have a better chance talking with that person (like those kids playing), He can use Persuade to reduce the bribe cost, and I think it would be wise to use a force point for Gather Information to have a better chance at succeeding. This is kinda important, and peoples lives are involved. Searching his Feelings could help to make sure he is on the right track and maybe even improve the time that it would take to find the information. Considering the event just happened I can't imagine it would take hours to find someone willing to talk, but its a game mechanic so its your call.. with four people helping I would think we could reduce the time.]

*You don't really need to search your feelings because you already know that asking for information about the local happenings is common sense, and that eventually you'll come to the right person. Spotting the kids is easy enough where you don't need perception. This check would take 1d6 hours considering you are not even in the area where it happened and you don't even know where the correct area is, not to mention you don't know the people's disposition to the attackers…they may not want to give their position away. So I'll rule that we will go by the rulebook for gather information: Locate Individual. I'm also very aware that characters lives are involved, but everyone knew that when they went to see the mayor. Everyone understood people were hunting for them and they took the risk of losing their lives to see this person. It was planned that you guys could have gotten attacked.*

Woro: "I am ready to go now, and I believe my two human friends are ready as well." Woroken was extrememly worried about Awne, and wanted to waste no time in getting to her, and hopefully the rest of Red Team.
However, while 99% of his mind was on the well being of his friends, the wookiee was astounded that Mur Eva was able to "feel" Awne's presence. He assumed that was another aspect of the Force of which he had no previous idea. Even though Master Lorhas had indicated he saw The Force in the wookiee, he still had his doubts.

Mur Eva quickly leads the group to the right, through a set of alleys with the common trash compactors and piles of junk. She has the group of people move through multiple alleyways throughout the residential area. After about a ten minute brisk walk, she motions for the team to kneel in an alley that seems to be the end of the housing area. You all take cover behind a pile of tore down speeder parts.
From the alley, you can see two large buildings parallel to each other on the northwest. In the center of these buildings appears to be a junkyard, with some very tiny buildings that would barely hold four people. A small amount of passerby and occasional speeder cross through this area. Mur Eva points to the large house on the right, nodding to Lorhas and the group.

Hadru scans the junkyard to see three people dressed in ripped and worn clothing. They have bandoliers, and pistols strapped to their thighs. They are carrying KX-60 blaster rifles. It is apparent to Hadru that these people look like they are dressed similar to the attackers in the ambush. They haven't noticed Hadru yet.

Other ideas are certainly welcome, too."

Lorhas: "I have a plan, we should try to lure one of those men back further in the alley and knock him unconscious quietly. We could have one of you wear their clothing and sneak into the building. Then we could have him get to your friends. This is a very delicate situation, and we don't know their intentions. If we alert these people it could bring Awne more pain, or death. I heard from Awne herself that she was guarded and bound, that they are completely hostile. Otherwise, we will have to just fight our way in, which could spell disaster. Do any of you have a better idea?"

The rest of you will standby behind this house out of sight. Hadru will be a lookout for Xander as he infiltrates the house. Hadru will go in if the area is clear. If they get alerted, we will have to go in. Does that sound good? Or do we need to try something else?"

Mur Eva gives a hand signal for everyone to be ready, she then proceeds down the alleyway. She walks about 20 meters into the junkyard, and she makes sure to stay out of sight distance of the other guards. The person she approaches is a human middle-aged man. Mur Eva greets the blaster-toting man.
Mur Eva: "Hi, one of my cute girl friends saw you over there. She'd like to talk to you. Don't you want to talk to her? You'll come with me."
Mur Eva gestures to him.
Guard: "Hmm, yea...I think I'll come with you.
Mur Eva leads the lone guard through the alley, and she brings him around to the hardened sand staircase where the group was hiding.
Mur Eva: "Oh she seems to have run off! Guess you're stuck with us."
Guard: "Us?"
Mur Eva: "Now!"
*Everyone roll for initiative. You may stay hidden if you want, and which case the guard will have to beat your stealth checks. Lorhas's Initiative: 19, Mur Eva's Initiative: 25.

*Yes, it is a powered blaster rifle.*
Hadru and Xander move up through the alley to the house. Hadru takes cover behind the trash compactor, and he doesn't seen any of the guards throughout the junkyard notice him. Xander walks out of the alley into the expansiveness of the junkyard. He can see a small, cylinder shaped building directly in front of him. The target house was behind it. He can see a guard to his right about 30 meters behind a substantially huge junkpile. He couldn't see any other guards at the moment. The target house was wide but only one story high. It was a rectangular shape with typical hardened sand used as the building's material. There was one moderate sized door in the center, and a smaller one on the leftmost portion of the building. There were a few glassless windows throughout the front of the building, however he couldn't see in very well.
Hadru spots a lone guard on the rooftop of the target building, and he is pretty sure that Xander hasn't noticed him yet. But he figures he might be ok under disguise. He can also see two guards in the junkyard. So he was sure there was a total of three armed men on the outside of the building. He can see one guard about to rove past the small cylinder building, and if Xander keeps moving the guard should meet him at a point past the building. Hadru estimates that his best choice for an observation point would be the small building, but he would likely get spotted moving up there. It might be better to stay in the alley.

Hadru holds behind the compactor. He concentrates through the Force to be aware if moving to the building would be good, and when would be the ideal time to do it. He also is aware through the Force that only three guards are out there. He notices one guard stop as Xander and the armed man cross paths. The other guard was in the junkyard, now was the time. With speed and quiet precision of his footsteps, Hadru trotted to the small building. The door slides open and he walks in quietly. The room was small, and it appeared to be a storage area. There were boxes on his right and a computer to his left in this tiny area. A ladder was in front of him about seven feet away, that is where the roof would be. A small spherical sensor droid hovers directly in front of Hadru.
Droid: "State your business and your name."
Outside of the small building the guard stops as Xander crosses in front of him. He glances at Xander's face. The guard turns around and walks back toward the junkyard.
*Xander gains 100 experience for fooling the guard.*
After he watches the guard head towards the junkyard, he then proceeds to the leftmost doorway. He arrives to the dark brown durasteel door and it seems locked. A key console is on the right. He punches in a few buttons and it seems the door is locked, and he doesn't have the passkey. Maybe one of the guards had it or he could slice his way through the door. It was also a possibility to try the main door. Both guards seemed to be in the junkyard at the moment, but he didn't know how long.

The room seems like a main area, and there are two sets of stairs behind the desk leading up. There are crates against the walls, and the place doesn't seem very well maintained. It appeared as if it was once a business that was abandoned, and these guys took it over. The Rodian immediately notices Xander.

*Combat post, all turn resolutions posted here for the storeroom battle.*
The droid hovers back a bit as Hadru lunges at it.
Droid: "ENGAGING SELF-DEFENSE PARAMETERS!"
The droid begins emitting a beeping alarm, it emits a laser from a jeweled blister on its spherical body. The little beam misses Hadru completely. Hadru goes to punch at it and he oversteps the droid as it hovers to the right. It emits yet another beam and the laser hits the door behind Hadru.
Droid: "REQUEST BACKUP AT STOREROOM, HOSTILE INTRUDER PRESENT."
The droid continues to beep and wail moderately loud for its size.
As Hadru reaches for his slugthrower, he hears a transmission emit from his comlink.
Vor'en: "Hey kid how's it going? We ran into a few problems on the way to the Mayor's place."
Hadru raises his iron sights up quickly and places them on the droid, he pulls the trigger and a slug travels blindingly fast towards the droid. The slug strikes the droid and it's knocked hard towards the right as it struggles to regain its hovering pattern. Hadru can see the slug lodged into its spherical body.
Xander takes off running from the front door of the building, he runs through the edge of the junkyard and takes a right. He has his eye on the storage building door as he approaches it. He charges through the door and stops as he watches Hadru square off with the sensor droid.
Master Lorhas and Mur Eva pull out their silver-hilted lightsabers. They begin walking towards the alley towards the alert.
Back in the storeroom, the droid fires a mini-blaster bolt at Hadru. The bolt goes wide and hits the wall, close to where Xander just ran in. Immediately after the shots, Xander can hear the sound of shuffling footsteps behind the closed door he just came in.
Voice:"It's in here?"
Voice 2:"Yea, check it out!"
Voice: "Right!"
As the Jedi move down the alley, Woroken spots an unfamiliar face walking towards their position.
Hadru continues to square off with the hovering droid. He fires a shot and the droid promptly hovers to the side.
In the alley, Woroken readies his bowcaster and then sprints towards the storeroom. The strange seems to be watching Woroken and the Jedi intently. Woroken reaches the end of the alley and takes cover behind a plasteel box. He can see the small storage building directly. He sees two armed men about to go into the structure.
In the building, Xander raises his rifle into his shoulder. He sights in as best as possible and fires at the small droid. The droid flies to the side as the bolt hits the wall.
Woroken continues to observe the building. The two blastermen look as if they are about to make entry to the structure with weapons blazing. Just then, the Jedi sprint past Woroken into the open area of the junkyard. The men spot them and begin raising their weapons towards the two Jedi. Their lightsabers snap-hiss to life with brilliant emerald and cyan coloring. The Jedi obviously knew a fight was imminent.
Hadru and Xander were slightly frustrated at the repulsor lift droid. The droid was circling about, dodging all their shots. The droid emitted another laser at Hadru. The laser lands at Hadru's feet harmlessly.
The armed men raise their KX-60's at the Jedi. One fires a bolt at Mur Eva. The young Jedi brings her cyan lightsaber up and intercepts the bolt as it is about to hit her. The bolt bounces back and hits the same person who shot it in the chest, dropping him instantly. The man watches his partner fall and grows angry, he fires a blast at Lorhas. He raises his emerald blade and deflects it into the man's stomach, and he collapses right next to the storeroom door.
Saracia runs through the alley to the downed opponents. She is able to get right beside the Jedi, and the enemies condition does not look good. She had to move a few more steps to get to them.
Hadru quickly pulls out his comlink and answers Vor'en, he fires with his other hand at the droid. The droid swivels right into the slug and falls to the ground with a clunk sound. The droid splatters its pieces across the floor. The room seemed clear of any enemies.
Woroken runs at full speed past the storeroom, heading to the moderate sized target building. The charging Wookiee spots a human rifleman pop up behind the cover of the side of the roof. The thug fires a blast at Woroken, the bolt hits in the sand next to him. He continues to run regardless of the attack, and he gets up to a small door. He attempts to go through but the door is locked by keypad
*Sliceable*. There seemed to be another door down to his right, it is a large double door that appears to be the main entrance. *About 16 squares.*
Master Lorhas and Mur Eva continue to walk with there lightsabers at the ready. Lorhas looks to Saracia and nods.
Lorhas: "Are you the doctor that Feldon sent to us?"
Mur Eva angers at Saracia's statement.
Mur Eva: "As a matter of fact, I am a padawan, and he is a master. We didn't mess up this rescue, the other people did, and now we are cleaning up this mess. So do as your ordered and shut up."
Lorhas: "Mur Eva! Keep your mind focused, don't worry about what people tell you, just go secure the other side of the building. We'll pass out the equipment now, everyone take cover inside the building. We must be very quick."
Mur Eva: "Toss me two stun grenades!"
Mur Eva seems poised to sprint towards the building, awaiting some grenades.
Xander walks outside the building and Master Lorhas instructs him to go back in. He then walks inside the building. He overhears Hadru speaking.
Lorhas: "Yes, if you could lock all the doors, we could keep them barricaded inside with no way to escape. We'll be able to come in from both sides of the building and pinch them in."
Saracia tosses the bandolier to Mur Eva, and begins walking to the direction of the downed guards.
Hadru walks to the computer terminal in the storeroom. He powers it up and the blue screen flickers to life. Something appears on the screen.
PLEASE ENTER IDENTIFICATION KEY TO GO FURTHER....
Hadru estimates that this computer will be difficult to get access through, it would take great skill to make use of it.

Back in the target building, The Rodian hears a beeping from the desk. He walks over and looks at a vidscreen on the desk.
Rodian: "The storeroom alarm has been tripped. Either it's another thief or we got these people's friends coming after them. I haven't seen you, so you must be new, go check it out!"
He points at Xander.

*Guys, I am drawing a mental blank. Am I forgetting anyone? Rith and Awne are captured. Vor'en is elsewhere. Xander and Hadru are occupied. Is there any other character besides myself and the Jedi right now?*

It takes her a few minutes, before, nearing her destination. She sees the strangers up ahead with their weapons out. *Ut-oh! Trouble is about to start!*, Saracia thinks to herself. Pulling out her *stun baton*, she heads directly toward the *Wookiee.*

The wookiee takes a deep breath and figures that with all the distractions, now was the time to move for his friends. He sprints to the room Lorhas told him that the group was being held in. The rescue was going to happen now, and his friends were to be freed.

Instinctively, Saracia reacts to correct the miscommunication in typical Qiraash fashion. *Utf +14 (Take 10?), if able to get past Mur Evaâ€™s Will defense:* A rapid mental picture of Mur Eva redirecting the blaster bolt into the chest flashes in her mind. Immediately, replaced with a rapid mental picture of the same thing, but, with the blaster bolt hitting the thugâ€™s arm and him dropping his weapon. While these are playing, she gets a strong sense of concern for the wounded. A more subtle undertone is the emotion of simple truth and no malice directed toward her or Lorhas.
As she takes the last few steps to reach the wounded, she pulls the bandolier over her head and tosses it to Mur Eva. She squats to one knee to evaluate their condition, then, stabilize the worse, first.

Mur Eva hears the blaster fire and shots toward Master Lorhas as she is preparing stun grenades.
Mur Eva: "Master! The Wookiee is already attacking the building!"
Lorhas looks to Hadru at the computer.

Xander gets right to the double doors and they hiss open, he sees Woroken squaring off with an armed Rodian.
Master Lorhas grabs one out of the six stun grenades, and begins moving towards the target building as well, lightsaber drawn and activated. Mur Eva sprints towards the back of the building, and she is behind it in about six seconds... out of sight.

Saracia gets flashes of the guard being disarmed by the redirected blaster shot, then, him pulling a backup weapon to continue fighting. This is followed by the flashes of some strangers to Saracia with underlying sense of urgency. She responds with a flash of understanding and resignation emotion, before Mur Eva is out of sight.
Having heard Lorhasâ€™s instructions, Saracia knows, she could be cut off from possible future patients. Luckily, the guards became Saraciaâ€™s patients, as soon as, she saw them falling from the redirected blaster fire. This gave them a temporary relationship due to her concern for any of her patients. So, being in right next to them, she should feel the Force disturbance from their passing or who is in greatest need.
***OOC:**  Conditional posting: Will delete the non-true condition, later.
**Condition 1:** If both guards has died*
Feeling the passing of the guards, Saracia rushes to join with and proceed with Lorhas. Since, he is proceeding with deliberate thought and action, which is the best chance for the fewest wounded.
***Condition 2:** If either guard is alive.*
Despite wanting to follow her allies, her duty is with those already wounded. Possible future wounded would have to wait. She immediately starts to stabilize the more wounded of the two. Placing her hand on the chest of the guard, she closes her mind and lets the force take over her sight. As her perception goes layer by layer and deeper and deeper, she understands the extent of the wounds and how best to care for him. She observes the strings of his aura and how the wounds have skewed and unraveled them. Intertwining her aura threads with his, she starts repairing the intricate fabric of life.
Those near her, hear Saracia let out a muted sound of pain under her breath, <span style="font-size: 0.85em;">â€œUnnghâ€, </span>as the pain of her patient hits her. (*Force Treatment, First Aid {24, Take10}, -1 condition due to not blocking out the pain, patient +9 hp*)

He sees blaster fire coming from the doorway. Hadru would be able to make it inside the building with just a few more steps, but he could see a rifleman on the rooftop watching his movements.
As Woroken and Xander square off with the Rodian, they can see someone appear from the stairwell just behind and to the right of the desk. He was a short Snivvian, dressed in a gray jumpsuit. He appeared to have a pistol drawn of odd design, it appeared to be heavily modified. The Snivvian seemed eager to get into the fight.
Snivvian: "I'd better be getting paid overtime, Deeluk!"
Rodian (Deeluk) : "Just shut up and shoot!"
Woroken brings his bowcaster up just enough to aim at the Rodian's chest, he sidesteps just as Woroken fires a quarrel. The bolt strikes junk behind the Rodian, pieces and sparks fly everywhere in the room with a sizzle.
A Gammorean armed with a Vibro-Axe storms down the same stairwell that the Snivvian just did, he runs to the doorway that Woroken and his friends are trying to get through. He jabs the axe at Woroken's side, and the axe leaves a small wound close to Woroken's rib area. *Woroken suffers seven damage.* The Rodian laughs at Woroken getting struck with the axe and fires his rifle at him. The bolt misses, flying through the empty space of the wide doorway.
A Trandoshan in shabby clothes runs down the right stairway and gets behind the desk right next to Deeluk.
Trandoshan: "Looks like we got a few of them here for their friends! We should get the prisoners out!"
Deeluk:"Yea, we'll do that if we can't stop them."

They seemed shocked at Xander's agility as the two gunman turn to face him, he brings his blaster rifle up at their head level and lets ten blaster bolts go at a cyclic rate. Both of them drop, their limbs entangling as they slump against the desk.
Snivvian: "Hmm, might be time to pack it up and leave boys."
Master Lorhas runs through the front double-doors seconds after Xander had killed the two gunman. His emerald lightsaber drawn, and at the ready position.
Lorhas:"There are no back exits, Mur Eva is securing the only other one. You had all better surrender your captives now!"
Snivvian: "Not unless I can get some truguts out of it!"
The Gammorean growls at this statement while he is in combat with Woroken.
Snivvian: "Shut up, I'll go to whoever pays me most!"
*It is now Saracia's turn.*

Snivvian: "My boss? You don't know what you are talking about, I have no boss. But I'll give you your friends if you pay me enough. 10,000 truguts, and that is not negotiable. If you can't pay now then we can't do business, and that means I'll be forced to kill you. Your friends will also die."
The Gammorean seems to lower his axe as he listens, then he speaks Huttese to the Snivvian. They both exchange a few words in Huttese.
Master Lorhas looks to the group and whispers, keeping his lightsaber ready.

*Aiming cost two swift actions. But for expediency's sake I'll give you the cover, shoot, and aim action.*
Hadru runs behind a pile of junk that looks to be a large broken down machine of some type, it would protect him from the enemy blaster bolts. He quickly peeks around the pile of junk and aims his sights on the rifleman. He fires and he sees the bolt fly wide to the left of him. He was very close to where his friends had gone in, but this armed man could prove troublesome to him.
Back in the small room past the double-doors, Lorhas looks outside after hearing a blaster shot.
Lorhas: "Call off your friends if we are giving you truguts."
Snivvian: "I cannot control them, I am a freelancer who was employed by them, they follow different orders. What I can do is guarantee safe passage to your friends location, but I'll need payment now or else your business is not worth it."
Master Lorhas looks to the group and whispers.

Saracia had carefully watched the Snivvian's motions as he spoke to the Gammorean in Huttese. As far as she could tell, he seemed to be telling the truth about wanting to secure a deal with the Jedi and others.
The Snivvian pulls out a comlink and begins speaking Basic into it.
Snivvian: "Hey Teemus, let them hear the voice of the captives, Deeluk wants to make sure they are ok."
Saracia immediately notices he is being deceptive about that last statement. *Saracia gains 100 experience points.*

Saracia thinks the Jedi, as being a bit naÃ¯ve in these negotiations. One should never show oneâ€™s hand, until the game has been played. Now, they knew, how much we have. They will just keep asking for a little bit more. â€œYou donâ€™t expect us to carry around 10,000 trugets, do you? We would be shot at by half the citizens, as we walked down the streets. On thousand is quite a sum of money. Plus, you are alive to spend it. What say you?â€

*It wasn't so much as he was naive, he was asking the group for more truguts. He was also whispering to the group, and the Snivvian was listening in. He was making sure that everyone have given up all their money. I was making it obvious as a GM so everyone would pass money over so we could get the storyline advanced, as it seemed the group was being a little slow towards handing money over.*
Snivvian: "Unless you can pay me immediately I have no reason to do business with you because
I can get it elsewhere. I'm not letting you get an opportunity to leave my sight without the money. Now hand it over!"

But, we donâ€™t have the full price with us. Plus, this is not the place for such a trade. Where do you want this transfer to take place? Need to get the rest.

Meanwhile, in the junkyard outside of the gang's building. The rifleman on the roof had kept Hadru behind a large broken down machine for cover. Hadru looks up to acquire his target better, and he hears a blaster bolt impact the metal in front of him. The cover was working for him at the moment.
A few feet away, Xander already had his weapon muzzle aligned towards the Snivvian. He simply pulled the trigger and a bolt shot past the Snivvian as he sidestepped a bit. This battle was very
vivid and vicious at close quarters. Every blaster shot echoed off the walls and hit your ears hard, making you want to flinch as the shootout continued. You could hear the Gammorean snorting as he was meleeing with Woroken.
Lorhas put his hand on Woroken's shoulder as he stepped right next to him, he was bracing him so he could squeeze past the closed double-doors. Lorhas shot his left arm forward, opening his hand. The Gammorean and the Snivvian were knocked over as if a giant gust of wind hit them at incredible speeds, they hit the ground hard and they were visibly shaken.

Hadru ducks his head as the blaster bolt sears the Junk machine he is using for cover, he decides to take total cover behind the machine. This time Hadru doesn't expose himself, not even a little bit. He sits behind the junk waiting just like when he made the decision to run for the storage room. With his weapon ready, he waits for that gut feeling in his stomach to tell him when the time was right to pop up and shoot. Hoping the thug will expose himself and make an easier target.
Hadru to Vor'en on his comlink

Back outside, Hadru searches for a way to get better cover. He sees a large piece of metal jutting out of the broken machine in front of him. It had a opening just big enough for him to present his head and weapon only. *You get total cover. Your action is readied.*
Rifleman: "What are you hiding for? Afraid of getting shot? Hahaha!"

As Hadru is hiding behind cover, he hears another blaster bolt impact the metal he was hiding behind. He was safe for the moment. Hadru looks as a figure is approaching him, it seemed Vor'en was emerging from the alley they were waiting at earlier.

As the riflemen is distracted trying to shot Hardu. Vor'en takes carefull aim at him. Knowing he has to end this quickly and also the fact that he couldn't take a hit now if he wanted to. "Iff I every needed to pull off a shot now is the time."

Vor'en turns toward the roof of the building, and he looks over the junkyard at the rifleman. *28 squares away.* He lets off a shot from his blaster pistol. *1- ammo.* The bolt flies way over the rifleman's head.

He ducks past the snivvian moving up the stairs to position him between Xander and the wookie. Xander knew exactly what to do his combat instructer had done it to him several times in training. Sizing up the snivvian he gives him a boot to the head.

Xander moves through the tight spaces of the small room, he squeezes past Woroken. The Snivvian quickly spots him moving and fires a shot that misses Xander completely. Xander gets to the Snivvian's backside as his attention switches back to Woroken. Xander throws a fist, striking him in the back of the head. The Snivvian's head and neck recoils next to Xander's firm strike.
As the group is surrounding the Snivvian, Master Lorhas gets to his front. He delivers a standing mid-level kick to the Snivvian's stomach. He reacts to the blow by putting his hands over his stomach, and he looks to be growing more weary as the fight continues on.

Saracia almost doubles over, due to the shot in the stomach. Instinctively, one hand goes to cover the damage to her mid-section. While she uses her other hand against the steps, to prevent falling face first into them. After scrambling up a step or two, she regains her balance. *(move)*
She takes a split second to calm herself, fighting down the pain and anguish. *(Swift, Second Wind)* Now, that she is slightly up the stairs, she turns to ensure , she is out of the Snivvianâ€™s sight. She surely does not want to be the target for a second try on her life. Saracia regains her perception of the â€˜hiddenâ€™ enemies and captives. *(standard, UTF +13)

Saracia can feel the people inside of the building, all of them. Indeed she had a strong sense of them with the Force. She turned right after she moved up to the staircase to the nearest pair of life forms. She was walking through a small, shadowy hallway that had junk pieces cluttering the area. She could see a shut durasteel door directly ahead of her.
*It is now Hadru's turn.*

Hadru jumps up from his kneeling position and rests his sights on the rifleman's chest. He squeezes the trigger and the bolt strikes exactly where his front sight tip was aiming at. You hear a scream from the rifleman as he collapses behind the roof.
Xander, Woroken, and the Jedi pummel the Snivvian with their fists and legs. He collapses down to one knee, he flicks his weapon to a different setting and points it at Master Lorhas.
Snivvian:"DAMN YOU!!!"
The blaster goes click, he awkwardly reaches for a blaster pack as he is getting beat down. He slaps it in his weapon, trying his best to fend off the multiple strikes. Xander quickly takes this opportunity to knee him in the stomach, and as he bends over, Woroken clotheslines him into the floor. The Snivvian appears to be unconscious.
*Combat has ended for now.*

Saracia spots a Farghul and a Human walk through the durasteel door directly in front of her. She can see another set of legs behind the Farghul. The human looks beaten and his face is bloodied, he looks into Saracia's eyes desperately.
Back where the Snivvian had just fallen, Lorhas comlinks to Mur Eva.
Lorhas: "What's your status?"
Mur Eva: "I just breached the side entrance, I'm heading to the room where Rith is. I haven't encounted any enemies."

Woroken saw the healer brush by combat and take a bolt to the stomach. She had went up the stairs alone, and not wanting to lose a member of the team, he hustles after her after grabbing the bowcaster he had dropped earlier in the fight. "Let's go everyone, we have to find everyone!" exclaimed Woroken temporarily forgetting Master Lorhas was the only one that could understand him.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-15 19:44:04)

Hadru and Vor'en run through the double doors of the target building. They walk into a small room with a desk and junk scattered throughout the area. Two bodies are behind the desk, Lorhas and Xander are standing over another. They briefly see the Wookiee go up a flight of stairs past the desk. Master Lorhas nods to the group, telling them to secure the Snivvian.
Woroken runs up the stairs and can see Awne directly to his front, along with Dexer. It appears they are standing in a doorway next to Saracia.
Human: "Stop right there! I'm getting through here, and don't try to stop me...or I'll kill one of these people!"

The wookiee immediately raises both of his hands in a gesture of understanding and nonviolence. He saw both the Farghul and the human were barely able to stand, and could easily be finished off with a single blow. They were too close to allow harm to come to his friends now.
He shifts his gaze to the humanwho had just spoke to him to see how the human would proceed.

Lorhas walks up the stairs and approaches the human cautiously, he adds on to what Xander had said. Xander cannot see the human, as he was crouching behind Awne.
Lorhas: "We've destroyed all your friends, and if you have to kill ours...go ahead. But you won't live past the first shot. So I'd advise you to leave, and we will do you no harm."
The human lets go of Awne, and walks past the group very carefully. Lorhas motions for everyone to keep their weapons down. Once he reaches the stairs, he breaks out into a run, leaving the building.
The Jedi approaches Awne and Dexer as everyone settles down.
Lorhas: "Are you ok?"
Dexer: "You guys are bad news! I should of never tagged along with you! Radon was right to leave you behind!"

Awne breathes a sigh of relief falling against a wall and willing herself to not slide down it, they still needed to get out. She grins at the jedi "Do we look alrright?" she chuckles softly, kicking her foot out to the beat up human "be grrateful..you went missing on us, just be glad you happened to be caught by the same people as us." She looks up at the jedi "I'm glad you hearrd me.." she trails off and looks back at Dex "what do you mean he left us behind?"

Mur Eva: "Yes Master."
Lorhas looks to Saracia.
Lorhas: "Thanks for coming out here, we need to get as far away from this building as possible. Do they need immediate attention?"
Lorhas looks to Awne and Dexer.
Lorhas: "Can you run or walk on your own?"
Dexer: "I sure can!"
Dexer runs out of sight in a matter of seconds, you hear him exit the door past the stairs.

Awne and Xander work together to search the bodies of the fallen combatants. Their weapons are two typical KX-60 blaster rifles you have been seeing, and they look as is they have been poorly maintained. *Mechanics to repair* You also see blaster pistols of unknown design *Knowledge: Tactics to appraise*, which have also been poorly maintained. One of the scopes is broken from the KX-60. You also gather two fragmentation grenades, a stun baton, vibro-ax, datapad w/ encrypted hit list, knife, stun grenade, 2500 truguts, and an illegal heavily-modified blaster pistol *Knowledge: Tactics* that doesn't need work.
Master Lorhas walks down towards the group, clipping his lightsaber to his belt.

Even though, the Farghul can stand and move on her own, Saracia can see with a practiced eye; she is in bad shape. Saracia doesnâ€™t really care about the loot, but, lets the others proceed. Saracia gently, but firmly, places her hand on the Farghulâ€™s shoulder, as Awne goes about her business. With contact established, Saracia finds it easier to focus on Awneâ€™s body. Going layer by layer, Saracia sees and feels the various hues of force within the devastated body. It takes her little time to find the deep and grevious damage to Awneâ€™s body. Stimulating her circulatory system, the white blood cells are directed to the internal injuries to prevent infection. Next, Saracia reaches in to damaged arteries, knitting them together and hastening the clotting. Having cured the immediate internal injuries, Saracia is sure; she has stopped the possible internal bleeding, that could have easily started. Having finished, Saracia lets her grip go on the Farghul.
â€œYou really had a bad hair day! But, we'll have your fur and coloring back to normal, within a day or so. Just, be careful while moving.â€, Saracia says with a smile, though, there is obivous pain in her face.
It doesnâ€™t take Saracia long to perform this action. As she does so, Awne feels a slight warmth come over her body and a slight return of strength and well-being. *(Take 10, Force Treatment **23**, Awne +8 HP)*
â€œIs the computer portable or a fixed terminal?.â€, Saracia asks Hadru, having not seen the storage room.
*OOC: Force users could feel the force being used very close to them. Saracia is not trying to hide this fact, so, they can easily identify her, if they look.
OOC2: Condition Track: - 2 after healing Awne
OOC3: If Saracia has time after the healing, she will spend 3 swift actions over 2 rounds to move up the condition track to -1. That way, she can move with the others.*

Awne feels the warmth and gives a little sigh before realising that the person touching her was a female she'd never met and she was doing something that made her fur stand on end. She deftly moves out of her hold and gives her an appraising look though not altogether trusting "Don't touch me...thank you..but don't touch me again. After what I just went thrrough to keep them at bay and buy you all time to get to us I'd rratherr not have strrange people touching me."
The Farghul takes the knife and slips it into her skirt *(or her dagger sheath if it's still there)* She grabs up the rest of the truguts and turns to the others "hope no one minds..seems my little pot of money I had is gone and I'd rreally like to buy up some of the things I lost laterr." She also picks up one of the pistols and looks it over, grabs a holister and slips it on then the pistol in it. She takes one of the other rifles and slings it around her arm and neck so it rests on her back, lastly she grabs up the baton and tosses it to the wookie "Hold that forr me will you? might get a good prrice." then picks up the data pad and pockets it, looking at the others with a grin "people will pay high prrices to know if someone's trrying to kill them." As an after thought she grabs one of the jumpsuits, shifting through the ones she sees for the one that would most likely fit Rith and ties it around herself as a means to hold onto it. She then slowly walks to the door and leans her back against the wall before looking out cautiously "lets get the hell out of herre."

Woroken catches the stun baton thrown in his direction.

Saracia has not had the time to restructure her aura, when the wookie mentioned his wounds. So, Saracia moves over to the Wookie, reaching up and gently touching near the wound. Quietly, she closes her eyes and concentrates on feeling the damage and any deep problems. She tickles the Wookieâ€™s own bodyâ€™s systems, to hasten its own healing power. A warmth comes through the wookieâ€™s body and eases the muscles around the wound, like a good massage.
Anyone watching Saracia notices; her face is extremely tight, as she grits her teeth, with minor contortions of anguish and pain. Those close can hear a groan from under Saraciaâ€™s breath, as though, someone had just punched her in the stomach.
Having finished what she can do right now, she withdraws her hand. Then, she looks up at the wookieâ€™s arm, inspecting her handywork.

When we get to a safer place, I can finish up the work with a medpac.â€, Saracia responds. Seeing the pro-offered hand, she fondly pats it, â€œThere are others in more need than I. We will need your strength to get to a safer place. I will help with the other wounded.â€

The pain and anguish, that was evident on Saraciaâ€™s face, subsided and left her face. Saracia truly empathizes and feels the pain of her patient, when she heals them. The pain is like the sudden punch of a fight, then, the initial pain subsides. Though, she does seem slightly off kilter, similar to when someone has an earache or mildly ill. Saracia doesnâ€™t feel completely up to par.
But, it will only take a minute or two for her to completely readjust her aura to normal, from the interference and mild unraveling caused by correcting her patients aura.
Saracia gets under Vorenâ€™s arm, to help support him for walking. She hopes to get minor respites, while moving for her aura to return to normal.
She follows the others on their way to safe haven.

Hadru leads them back tracing a less likely route that would draw less attention or witnesses. Trying to avoid following enemies, he uses his survival instincts and guides the group back to the embassy or rendezvous point.

As they start to move out, "Mur Eva is helping another freed captive. Rith, I think, his name is. We are to rendezvous with them at the alley, where the gangster was subdued.â€

"Great, I am glad to hear he made it." Vor'en seems more relived that his friends have made it. "Poor Ben though, kid never had a chance." Vor'en close his eyes as the anger raises in him. "They will pay for that, I swear."

Awne had caught the part about that woman jedi and her Rith, yes she was glad that he was free and alive..to what extent she wasn't sure but alive..had to be. yet..he was with that woman..she growls lowly, then pulls back on any more, she was helping...had to remember that.

"Ask The Jedi idf they have come across any gear laying around." Vor'en looks at Woro. "I would kind of not have to buy it all agian." Vor'en hopes they find some of it.

Lorhas watches Saracia as she quickly tends the wounds of Woroken and Awne.
Master Lorhas: "Yet another that has a relation to the Force, most curious indeed. We have no time, we aren't sure if they will reinforce this position or not. Follow me everyone."
The Jedi Master heads down the stairs, past the fallen gangsters you all struggled to beat. He walks through the double-doors to the wide openness of the junkyard.
*Add your weight to your carry capacity, all of your items are accounted for by me. Saracia was unable to recover due to the fact she couldn't rest, you all regained HP that she listed.*

Saracia has Vorenâ€™s arm over her shoulder, helping him move with the others. She is careful to match her speed with Vorenâ€™s, so, not to overtax the wounded warrior. Together, they follow the others toward the rendezvous with Mur Eva and Rith in the alleyway. More worried about her patient, she mainly keeps her focus on Voren and only looks to ensure safe footing, etc. along their path. She figures the other members will keep an eye out for possible hostiles.

The group walks through the junkyard carefully, as to not over strain the wounded. Awne tries to spot any suspicious activity around her, but she is too weary to notice anything effectively. Although none of you can see any imminent danger, you have a feeling that it could be closing on you quickly. You move cumbersomely through the alley and take a right next to the stairwell of the house you staged the rescue.
It seemed the detained thug had escaped, and you see Rith resting on the stairs. He looks very bruised and battered, he has a black eye and a bleeding lip. He looks up and smiles at the team, with whatever shred of joy he might have left from the draining experience you all endured.
Master Lorhas: "Is he doing well?"
Mur Eva: "Yes, nothing that some bed rest won't solve."
Rith: "Yea, well my face is damaged, I hope bed rest will solve that."
Mur Eva chuckles.
Mur Eva: "No amount of bed rest will aid your face."
Master Lorhas replies sternly,
Lorhas: "Let's make way to the Embassy, we can work things out there."

Awne moves past the Jedi to the man, lowering her rifle just enough to hug him tightly to her and nuzzle his neck, kissing his cheek. "I'm so glad to see you alive.." She rests against him only a few seconds before moving away and positioning her rifle again "lets get the hell out of herre."

Hadru is alert and he doesn't let his guard down. His rifle is in his hands, but his not exactly walking around with it in a military fashion. Trying not to look like a solider ready to fire on the first target he sees, Hadru moves to point and stealthily scouts ahead making sure the path is clear before giving his friends the sign to move forward.

*Hadru's stealth rating 24.*
Hadru watches as the group reconciles on the stairs in front of the residential area where they staged the rescue. He turns and looks toward the crowd of people going about their daily lives. He realizes that the enemy could emerge from that crowd in an instant. He advances forward of the group's position with stealth like finesse that only a street smart boy could have. He utilizes the alley way's to observe the gathering of people to spot potential targets. He realizes that there are armed gangsters amongst the crowd, but they don't appear to be looking for the group.
Mur Eva looks down to Rith.
Mur Eva: "Well, time to get on your feet."
Rith: "Oh man, I'd rather sit on my butt and shoot than walk anymore."

If anyone could see under Xander's helmet they would see his eyes rolling at the sight of Awne and Rith snuggling. He looks over his new found blaster and is surprised and delighted by its modifications. He quickly replaces his old blaster pistol with it in his hip holster. He rests his gloved hand on it and feels its grip while they move towards the embassy. He doesn't really say anything just sticks close to the group and the *jettii*

With half their number wounded, their survival is quickly getting to the medical center, quickly. Looking over her new found comrades, she swiftly appraises their resources and the wounded mobility. Voren should definitely be transported and it may be quicker to have another transported as well.
Saracia really did not have time to evaluate earlier, due to arriving as combat was starting. She is surprised at herself, for not noticing the medkit the wookiee was carrying.
â€œWe may be able to move more swiftly, if we use the 2 repulsor lift stretchers from my and the Wookieeâ€™s medkits. We would only loose half a minute setting them up and using them for the most wounded. Then, we could move quite a bit faster.â€

Master Lorhas motions to the group to move ahead. Mur Eva moves to Hadru's position as she guessed he was scouting. She quietly approaches Hadru and nods to him.

Vor'en follows as best he can. He looks over at Rith and Awne, they have something special going ever if Rith is to blind to see it. Vor'en has never had that because of the way his life turned out. In turth he never really looked for it though, his life was hard enuff with out worring about someone else all the time. "Come on you two." Looking at the the love brids and smiling. "Plenty of time for that later."
Vor'en sees Hardu scout ahead of the group. The kid was good at what he did Vor'en had seen that. When Vor'en saw "The Kid" as he called himself in action he was remind a Ben sure the kid was headstrong and green but he was slowly getting it. Now he was gone he should have been there for the kid, but nothing could change that now. Then there was the to new ones to the group. They where working out ok so far, he still didn't know what they brought to the team yet but if they signed with this group trouble was all they would find.

Saracia is more than willing to defer to the more combat experienced members. She continues to help Voren move and provide support. She trusts the force to keep watch out behind them, paying attention to any life, that seems to be approaching them in any hurry.

Rith watches Vor'en with a surprised look, he then looks to Awne.
Rith: "I don't know what is happening to me anymore."
Rith shrugs and then moves where Mur Eva had went, followed by Lorhas. Saracia opens herself up to the Force but quickly realizes that life was dense in this particular area, and she couldn't pinpoint any immediate threats towards them. She was able to sense that Lorhas was using careful scrutiny through the Force to watch her actions.
The group reassembles in the alley, and once they do, Rith recommends to walk back to the Embassy while appearing nonchalantly as possible. You all proceed to move through the residential area, keeping your eyes open yet looking casual.
The foot travel seemed rather uneventful as it went on for a couple of minutes. Passing through the large residential area further left the impression that life continued on here despite wrongdoings. You exit out of the residential area to a huge clearing that would eventually lead to the Embassy.
Pedestrian traffic seemed to thin out as you approached the Mos Esre walls/Embassy. The twin suns were ever present, making you sweat as most of you ached for rest. You could see the maroon building in the distance, looming as a beacon for temporary safe haven.

Awne sticks close to Rith as the group walks, trying to look as casual as possible while still on edge. She keeps her eyes open for anything even as she sees the building, they were almost there..

As they walk to the Embacy, Vor'en doesn't hide the fact that he looks like something even a Rancor would think twice about eating. "Almost there, then a day of rest and then we take that job for the mayor. No sence in not making any creds." Vor'en wonders how many questions the Lt. and the others would have for him. He had allready explianed everything to the Felzor and he would explain it to Awne and Rith as soon as there was time.
He looks over at Rith and Awne, Rith seems to be battling with something. Vor'en hopes he wins the fight. "Sorry you two." He says to Rith and Awne. "If I had waited for the others we wouldn't have gotten to that mess back there." "I won't let it happen again, I promise." Those two two had been with him the longest, even Woro had been there sence the begining. The Jedi thought that "The Force" as they called, had brought them all together for some great perpose that no one had known about. All new was if this was the case this Force the Jedi held in such high asteem had one Frac'in sence of humor. They have been though one disaster after another. Luck was not on there side.

Awne turns her gaze to her friend, a glare finiding it's way at him as her fur puffs and then relaxes. It seemed to be unconcious, maybe from what she went through was catching up with her. "You and I..arre going to have a talk. And this talk may orr may not involve morre bed rrest forr you." she growls her words, the feline was very much for lack of a better word, pissed.

Saracia makes sure her hood is up, as they walk through the residential areas. Tantooineâ€™s twin suns were not very good for her pale skin. Saracia looks at her comrades, associating names with faces for those she had names for. Saracia was sure of correct association of the names Lorhas, Mur Eva, Rith and Awne. But, the others, she had no idea of their names. And this was not the time to try to find out. So, she continued in silence.
Saracia ponders; why such scrutiny from Lorhas after she notices it. She is aware the Empire killed most of the Jedi and destroyed their temples. But, those Qiraash within the Empire were hunted also. So, there really should not be such suspicion. They did loose lots of their knowledge. So, maybe, they have learned fragments of history, causing them to be leery of me and my race. They may not know the full story and reasons for battles between the Qiraash and the Jedi, leading to untold deaths, amongst both. They may not even know, *when* the battles occurred.
Saracia decides to keep quiet, until they have reached safety. She saw no reason; to put two seasoned combat veterans on alert against her.
Saracia was happy, when she saw the Embassyâ€™s walls. *â€™Its always darkest, before the dawn.â€™*, pops into her head, making her a bit uneasy. This would be a great place for any ambush. It was open range with no innocents, to be caught in the cross-fire. Plus, their enemies would have had time to pick the most advantageous positions to pick them off at a distance. Weary of an ambush, Saracia does her best to locate any enemies, as they cross the open ground.

'Not much farther. I suspect this to be the last point at which they could ambush us, so be on your toes.'
Hadru continues to work as the point guide, the enemy knew who they were and if they had time to set up this would be the best location being less crowded and quiet. Hadru hoped he didn't get the gut feeling that always told him something bad was going to happen.'

Woroken continued walking in silence. The group was half blasted to death, burning up in the heat of the blast-furnace planet, exhausted, and altogether in poor spirits. Not a banner day for Red Team. Woroken didn't want to inform the rest of the group just yet that before meeting with the Lieutenant tomorrow, he had to run by the bazaar area and pick up his now-mended spear. That could wait until they all had a chance to rest a bit.
