# [Heir of the Blazing Claw] Chapter One: Point Nadir

### **Avarna** (2009-01-26 22:41:18)

(Note: Its suggested that you read though the Point Nadir chapter of S&V)
Captain Gemthrine sat in the commander's seat as the *Hope Fades* navigates the Jackrab hole, the tunnel leading from the surface of the Resh 9376 comet, to the hollow interior that was called Point Nadir. OOM-45 stood nearby, as if intending to take over the helm at any moment. The sides of the tunnel are decorated with ships that had failed to navigate it successfully, and any ship larger then the former Confederacy warship wasn't going to make it.
"Easy, Fourtyfive, We've made this run countless times." The duros told the blue and tan painted battle droid, who didn't show any response to the statement. This didn't cause Dosha to stop talking. "We'll need to pick up some pilots if we're going to keep the snubfighters we picked up."
By that time, the *Hope Fades* docks in the Mooring Central Cove.Â

Seeming to sulk, Nadia filters through the disappointing selection of bounties at the Bounty Post located within Souk's central gallery. Leaning on the counter, she also keeps a wary eye on events happening around her. She isn't concerned about anyone bothering her; the dark blue Mandalorian armor enough of a threat of what she is capable of.

Lorcan smiled as he walked out of Fische's Pub "So I need to come back later. Well that's fine by me. I'm wiling to wait a hour or so to see me new ship and meet the crew that I'll be taking over" he said he he looked around. After a few moments of thinking he started walking through The Souk seeing if there was anything for sale that might interest him

Prince Gaston wakes up with a very satisfying stretch.  The soft markak worm-silk sheets of his bed feel luxurious against his skin. The lights of the overheads slowly brighten as his apartment synchs itself to the time of the Space Station. He looks at the chronometer on the bedside, reading 07:00.
â€œTime to wake up!â€ he smiles, growling through another good stretch. He slaps the naked bottom of the Twiâ€™lek dancer sleeping on her stomach next to him. â€œYou have a starship to catch!â€
The Twi-lek girl rolls over sleepily and flashes him a beautiful smile. She batts her beautiful green eyes at him. â€œAs you wish masterâ€.
â€œAaha!â€ Says Prince Gaston, leaning over and cupping her chin with his hand. â€œMaster no more!, You must hurry to get readyâ€¦. But first! The Prince demands wine!â€, he says with a flourish.
The Twi-lek slips out of bed and heads to the apartmentâ€™s galley. Prince Gaston jumps out of the sheets, landing on his feet at the end of the bed.
â€œIm surprised you have any energy leftâ€, says the Twi-lek girl coyly, as she searches through the galley for breakfast.
â€œThe Prince always has energy!â€, Gaston smiles dashingly. He walks over and begins to examine himself in the mirror. â€œToday is a good dayâ€, he thinks to himself. â€œBut funds are getting very low. I barely had enough cash to free this one, and there are always so many.â€ He flashes himself a smile in the mirror admiring his long sleek headtails and his dark black eyes, and then just for good measure, flashes himself another.
The young Twi-lek brings a plate of fruit and a glass of wine over to Gaston. â€œYou know Ma.. er.. Prince Gaston, I could always stayâ€¦..â€
â€œNo!â€ interjects Gaston. â€œNo.. noâ€¦ youâ€™ve already contacted your family.â€, he smiles charmingly at her.  â€œYou have a place to go..  they would miss you terribly. Think how excited they are!. Plusâ€¦ the Prince doesnâ€™t need to be tied down right now. I have to erâ€¦ go back to my planet soon, and you cant breathe underwater.. so.. â€œ. He smiled again. â€œThis is for the best. Now go get readyâ€.
The Young twi-lek pouts and then goes to start putting her clothes on.
Prince Gaston thought of the last few weeks as he put on his pants. Something seemed strange in the air.. he could feel it, but didnâ€™t know quite what. Plus he had gotten an odd encrypted message from Sasha a few weeks ago to beware of danger. It had put him in a wary mood. Fortunately for the Prince, his wary moods lasted no longer than an hour.
â€œAh wellâ€, he smiled to himself standing up. â€œFirst I will drop this child off at her outbound ship, and then its off to Fischeâ€™s pub for breakfast.â€ Mentally he totaled up his remaining cash.
As he slipped his vibro-scimitar into the sash at his belt, he flashes himself another smile in the mirror. â€œToday is a day for another good deed done.â€ He smiles taking the Twi-lekâ€™s arm in his. â€œWhat could possibly go wrong?â€

Taylor woke up in the inn. He was still tired, he'd been traveling for about a month with that smuggler schutta. That part of his life was over, thank whoever may be running the cosmic forces of the galaxy. He walked over to his duffel bag, his jumpsuit was draped over it, as well as his trench coat.
He put the jump suit on, then the concealed holster that held his hold out blaster, then his hip holster with his DL-44, his utility belt came next, and finally his trench coat. He looked into the mirror that his small room provided. He needed a shave. He needed a haircut. He shrugged and walked into the 'fresher.
A splash of cold water his face from the sink, whatever drowsyness he had melted for the most part. He checked the room over one more time, grabbed his duffel from the floor and put it over his shoulder.
He'd have to find transport off of this rock, or go check out the mynock caves, maybe make some quick credits. Hell anything sounded good right now. His stomach rumbeled as he walked out the door into the hall way of the inn. Breakfest first.

Suddenly there is a loud hammering on the door to your apartment, and several Houk thugs employed by the Anjilac clan of Hutts burst in. There are three of them, each brandishing a Vibro-ax with a blaster carbine in easy reach. The lead thug points to you, and starts to speak in his native language. Its clear that he's unhappy about something.
If you speak Houk:

"You owe rent for this place. Pay up.

The young twi'lek girl you've been courting, gasps and pushes away from you, and makes a mad dash for the door. Not understanding the language herself, she believes Gaston has lied to her.

Nadia watches as the Bounty Post scrolls though the listed bounties for the third time. Still no one of interest as come up. Just then there is a beeping sound as the stations Holonet receiver dumps an update onto the post. One new bounty has come though the Imperial channels, for one Captain Dosha Gemthrine...

Even though it might seem earlier, there really isn't a set "day" or "night" in the Shadowport. The narrow streets, more like alleys, are always packed with people.

You head to the Souk, the market place is busy as it usually is. However your in a good place to watch as a large ship docks in the Moorings. Its easy to identify the *Hope Fades* by its monster Ion Cannon.

"Sweetie! Wait" Prince Gaston yells at the slave girl. "I dont know what these people are here for, get behind me!" The prince moves to try and get between the door and the girl.
Prince Gaston looks over at the goons. "Look, I cant  understand what your saying, can you speak basic?" He holds his hands up non-thretaningly. "Can you just tell me what this is about? No matter who you are, Im sure the port athority will be displeased when they see the holos of this. Also your boss will have to recompense me for any loss of property." He nods at the girl. "And this one is mine, and well paid for. I have the paperwork".
He smiles his best smile at the lead thug. "Lets be reasonable, can I offer you a glass of wine? Bottle of ale".

The Houk laugh as Gaston tries to step between the thugs and the Twi'lek girl, who has no interest in remaining with him. The thugs don't bother to detain her. They seem to be unimpressed by your attempt to improve they're opinion of you.
"We authority. You owe rent, pay now!" The leader speaks up in poorly spoken basic, holding his vibro-ax a little higher then before as if about ready to swing. Point Nadir is a Shadowport, with the only law enforcement provided by the criminal organizations.

For the fourth day straight Xorra awoke on the ship that'd brought him to this place.  He'd made a deal with its captain for some accommodations.  Though she thought the request unusual, she agreed to let him rest on her ship until she left the port, for a price, of course.
Soon he wouldn't be able to afford the luxury, as his funds were quickly dwindling.  He needed some income, but nothing appeared to be on the horizon.  There were no dueling competitions here, only brawls, both drunken and disorderly.
Exiting the ship brought a new day, and possibly new opportunities.  A roar filled the cavern, looking up he saw the fan shaped cruiser flying over head.  It had just come through the Jack Rab, and was setting down inside the port.  Without a word, Xorra left for the Slips, and from there the rest of Nadir.

Kyle was standing in one of the casinos at the Arcade, overlooking a sabacc game. He had plans to join in himself, but at first he wanted to check out the competition. After all, the lousier they were, the less heÂ´d have to cheat. And the less he had to cheat, the less was the risk to get caught.

(Nadia, Taylor, Kyle)
While Kyle can't tell if anyone is cheating, but then no cheating leaves the same evidence as really good cheating. However he does notice the commotion out in the Souk, between a Mandalorian and a twi'lek girl.
The Girl stops, only long enough to see it was a Mandalorian who questioned her, before changing directions, and literally runs directly into Taylor. Knocking them both to the ground.
----------------------------------------------------------
(Gaston)
Tired of waiting, one of the Houk brings his ax down, shattering a table. While the leader, "500 credits. Keep bad stuff from happening."
----------------------------------------------------------
(Lorcan, Victor)
The Toydarian merchant looks up from the circuit board he was working on. "That one... 100 Credits, get the cursed thing out of my shop!"
While the merchant had done a good job of maintaining the Droids available. The Toydarian has ran into some hard times, and need to liquidate his stock and get off Point Nadir before Epsis comes down and takes everything from him.
-----------------------------------------------------------
(Xorra)
Once he's off the ship. The smuggler he'd been bunking with appeared in the ramp. "Bye Sweetie." She says, blowing him a kiss, before raising the ramp. The engines whine as they warm-up and as he watches she takes off.
As He enters the Souk, he notices the commotion out in the Souk, between a Mandalorian and a twi'lek girl.

Victor finally gets himself powered on and is astonished to see once more that he is in a completely different place and that his chassis has been stripped and rebuilt.  He takes a few seconds to do an internal diagnostics check before looking around.  After a few seconds he notices a human standing near him apparently asking how much he costs.  *Great it would appear I've been taken as property once more, and this human might be looking to purchase me.*  Victor starts moving to get up and looks the rest of the area over.  **"I am not available for sale, I am a free thinking droid that has a purpose in my existence.  However if you can get me out of this shop I will gladly travel with you until such a time as we can agree that I have repaid you of your trouble."** 
Victor stands up and looks at the human for a few seconds before looking at the owner of the ship with the closest thing a droind can to loathing.  *If only I new I wouldn't be melted down for killing him he would be dead already.*  He thought as he awaited a response.

I own you and that's that, but to tell you the truth I going to need someone to help me out." Lorcan wrapped his arm around the droid and pulled the droid close as he started walking "See that ship there" pointing to the *Hope Fades* "I'm going to take out the captain and take it for my own. You help me do that I'll give you plenty of money and if you want you can be my right hand man if not I'll drop you off where ever you want." Lorcan looked at the ship again and smiled

Either these guys were actually playing by the rules, or they were very good cheaters. Anyway, Kyle didnÂ´t feel like taking up the match with them today. He had already had to drop playing in three other casinos for a while as his playing - and winning - had begun to gather some attention. He did notice something outside the casino. A TwiÂ´lek girl and a Mandalorian, and at least the TwiÂ´lek seemed a bit upset.
*Well, at least it wonÂ´t be more boring than looking at these guys play…*
Moving outside to the two persons, he looked at the TwiÂ´lek.

The Prince smiled at the goons.
"But let me tell you this. Im supposed to be meeting Zietta in about two hours. And that young lady who just ran out of here was a messanger of hers come to collect me. She has all your descriptions. So unless you are all planning on jumping ship in the next two hours, when I dont make my meeting Zietta is going to be awfuly mad at you. It wont take long to put two and two together and you guys are going to be taking a permanent nap in the Mines"

Taylor looked at the twilek. His eyebrows arched.
"As fun a situation this could be, I would appreciate it, HEY WHERE.. Another woman, another day." He picked himself up and looked down the hall then to the mando. His eyes narrowed thinking it was Boba Fett, the armor has that effect, the figure was obviously female, voice and the armor structure itself said that much. "Never better. But you know, most women come and go, just never had it happen that fast. She came from there, looked scared, thought I'd check things out." He looked in the direction the girl had come from, and began walking that way. "Come if you'd like but it's probably just a schutta skipping out on a bill."

Carrying everything he owned, Xorra was in no mood for a calamity.  However, it seemed the calamity would not be ignored.  A small crowd had formed around the Twi'lek and the armored Mandalorian, and it seemed intent on keeping him from passing.  Muscling his way through the gathering of onlookers, he ended up where he didn't want to be, in the middle of things. 
"Can't this happen someplace else?"  He complained as he dropped his chest.  Though he didn't understand her native tongue, he responded with one he thought she might understand.  In Huttese he asked, "You should run along home, this is no place to be dressed like that."

As yet an another strange man comes into the circle and starts to verbally abuse the girl, she is once more reduced to tears. But this is all a mote point as....
Three Houk thugs lead what appears to be a noble born Nautolan down out of the building. Its common knowledge that Houk work for the Hutt clan in control of Point Nadir. Its not an unreasonable assumption that this Nautolan is the master of the Twi'lek girl, and that he's now in serious trouble.

Looking over toward the Nautolan she understands what has been happening.
"You should leave now. Ba'slan shev'la. But you are going to have to start crying or you'll look even more suspicious. Make a choice. Stay and help your master, or leave and take your chances." All this she whispers to the Twi'lek in an undertone, hoping that she can hear between the sobs.
Loosening the blaster pistol strapped to her leg she turns her attention toward the Houk. Her next action dependent on what the girl does.

Ignoring the other man bumping his way through the small crowd, KyleÂ´s eyes falls on the three Houk. As he sees the Nautolan among them, he begins to piece things together, and as the Mandalorian next to him starts to reach for her weapon, he breaks into laughter. 
"Well, well, if it isnÂ´t the HuttÂ´s finest. And once again they have proved their heroics by taking such a threatening being into custody"
He pauses for a moment, and a flash of recognition flies across his face and he points his finger at the one who appears to be in charge.
"Hey, I recognize you. You cheating hutt slime, you took me for everything I had!"

Prince Gaston is lead out of his room by the three Houks. One in front and two behind. Desperately his eyes scan the crowd trying to figure out what next to do.
Much to his dismay he sees the young dancer standing next to a female Madalorian in deep blue armor. "What by the maker is she doing? Why did she not run to the docking bay like I told her to?" THere was still time, the ship was not due to leave for another two hours.  He had to get her free of all this.
The Houks lead him into the street and closer to the dancer and the Madalorian. As he got closer he felt waves of power off of the Mandalorian. She resonated with sorcery like his old teacher.
Suddenly a strange human steps in front of the lead Houk.
"Well, well, if it isnÂ´t the HuttÂ´s finest. And once again they have proved their heroics by taking such a threatening being into custody"
He pauses for a moment, and a flash of recognition flies across his face and he points his finger at the one who appears to be in charge.
"Hey, I recognize you. You cheating hutt slime, you took me for everything I had!"
This was the break he was looking for. In the temporary pause and confusion, Gaston closes his eyes and reaches out with his Dathomir sorcery and squeezes the trigger of the lead Houk's Holstered weapon.
> Use the force Check +9, I will be spending a Force Point to help succeed at this. Since this is critical to my next action and I am moving forward, I will spend my Destiny point if I need to.

In the distraction of the explosion, Gaston makes a sprint for the Twi'Lek and the Mandalorian, realizing he has only second before the Houk grab him, or just open fire.
"Get to the rendevous!" he snaps at the young girl in Basic. "Your ship leaves in an hour! I did not pay all that money to free you, just to see you waste your life here. These goons are after me, not you."
He turns to the Mandalorian. "I have heard that the Mandolorians are a honorable people. I am Prince Gaston de Nautol, help me get rid of these goons, and lead this girl to freedom, and you can name your price"

Eventually you find it near a warehouse, that was constructed out of discarded cargo pods. Several ASP loader droids are filling the truck with Proton Torpedoes and Concussion Missiles.
Overseen the droids, from an E-web mounted on the truck, is a humanoid wearing an Ubese environmental suit. Its nearly impossible to determine the beings gender, but you get a distinctly male impression. He turns the heavy weapon towards you, as you approach, and speaks in the soft spoken manner of the Ubese.

Lorcan smiles as he looks at the Ubese man and aims his sniper rifle, mounted on his shoulder, at the mans head "No idea what you just said but unless you think you've got a faster trigger finger I'd suggest that you lower that gun" he says in a coll, calm tone "Now I'm just here cause I saw the ship you came form and wanted to know if you needed an extra crew"

Xorra's words seemed to have the opposite effect than he'd intended.  The girl began crying anew as she felt threatened by his comments.  Her emotional state was eclipsed by a sudden outburst of chaos.  A weapon discharged, then a Houk was hollering in pain.  The person the Houk's held made a break toward the girl, and unleashed with a barrage of words about a rendezvous, a ship, and freedom.  Three things Xorra was familiar with.
(Initiative +3)
It was a little crowded to be brandishing his blade, as such he instead drew his blaster.  Waiting for someone else to take the first move, he focused solely on not getting shot himself.  With a sideways glance he looked to the Twi'lek slave.  If she was free as the Nautolan had said, then Xorra would see her to her ship.

Kyle donÂ´t hesitate, at least hoping that his words put some kind of confusion in the head of the Houk. After all, he had lost some money to *a* Houk some time ago, but it didnÂ´t necessarily had to be this one. Not moving, he casually pulls the blaster at his side from its holster, flicks the switch to set it for stun, and presses a shot at him.

(Note: When a heavy blaster pistol is **set to stun**, it only does 2d8, not 3d8. I've taken this into account.)
There is a hail of blaster fire, as Nadia, Gaston, Kyle and Tyler fire almost as one. Three of the four shots drops the lead Houk, leaving him to drool on the floor stunned.
Then is the thugs turn, Both the Houk behind Gaston swing at him with they're Vibro-ax, as he's the closest, and connecting. The other three move closer to the fight, two of them fire on Nadia, as the Mandalorian must be the greatest threat, while the third fires at Kyle.

As Lorcan and the Ubese exchange dirty looks, a female human comes out of the warehouse.  She sighs, apparently this isn't the first time this has happened. "Oh, is this personal, or can anyone draw a blaster and point it at someone?"
"You want to join our crew? Then be a dear and back off about ten meters, then Tosh won't feel the need to shot you. We can talk once we're done loading the warheads."

As the Prince pulls off a shot, the other Two Hulks run up to him and swing thier mighty vibroaxes. He tries to jump out of the way, but the crouching slave girl behind him blocks his path. One slices deep across his chest while the other cuts into his thigh all the way to the bone.
He doubles over rolls backwards. "To day is not a good day to die", he gasps through clenched teeth. Closing his eyes he begins to chant the Jensaarai spells taught to him by the Sorceress Sasha.
"*Gladius Venefica Caderi VELOX!*" He spits out.

Shots were fired all around, but none seemed destined to strike Xorra, or the Twi'lek girl he was so keen to help.  With a quick step, he moved closer to the girl, then with his free hand rested it on her shoulder.  "We should go, get you to your ship."  He spoke in a gentle manner.  He needed her to trust him.  Letting her go for a moment, he reacquired his luggage.  His blaster hand remained at his sides.

Kyle barely dodges out of the way for a blaster bolt, but he can feel the distinct smell it left in the air beside him. Turning his pistol straight to another one of the Houk engaged with the Nautolan, he is a little suprised to see the others vibroblade leap up from his belt and strike at the Houk. Shifting his aim slightly, he sends the bolt the other way.

You wait patiently, exchanging looks of hatred with the Ubese, Tosh, that is manning the large blaster, while the human female and ASP droids finish loading. Finally the chore is done, and the labor droids pile into what space is available on the truck. The woman pulls off her gloves as she comes to speak with you.
"Alright. So you want to join our crew?" While she's friendly, there is also a weariness to her voice, as if she's gone though this sort of thing one time to many. "The only bunks we have open, are for Fighter Jocks and Boarder. Its dangerous, and the pays crap, but if you prove yourself useful, the Captain might send you on scouting runs, and those can be a lot of fun."

(Nadia, Taylor, Kyle, Xorra, Gaston)
The Twi'lek girl does move, But only to run away from Xorra and the fight with the Houk. More by coincidence then anything else, she ends up heading towards the Slips.
In the chaos of the fight, Another Houk is left sleeping after taking hits from Gaston, Nadia and Taylor. While Kyles shot nails a third one heard, and he seems dazed for a moment. The thugs that all miss they're targets, but at the same time move closer, it would be a safe assumption that they'll be bringing they're vibro-axes into play in moments.

Realizing that survival just had become more important than avoiding killing any thugs working for the local Hutts, Kyle switched his blaster back to lethal and sent another bolt towards the Houk he had just nailed with the stun shot. Fighting to keep his distance, he backed away, trying to keep enough space between him and them so that he could react in time if they decided to charge.

Summoning the magic taught to him by Sasha the Jensaari Witch, he swings his own blade forward to intercept them before they can get within atack reach. With a twist of his hand his ancient Scimitar swings a mighty cut at the lead Houk.

Xorra saw the fear form in the Twi'lek's face as he spoke, she turned and ran before Xorra had collected his luggage.  She had too far of a head start for him to keep up with his added weight, as such he left the girl to her own devices.  The Nautolan's words of regret brought a faint smile to Xorra's lips.
Fearful of a shot to the back if he ran, Xorra dropped his chest and in the noise and confusion turned quickly bringing his weapon up.  With erratic movements he took a step back and to the side.  With little hesitation he fired.

The Houk aren't paid to care that someone has a floating sword. Kyle's shot strikes home taking down another of the Houk, While Xorra hits another. Now weary of the floating sword, the thugs manage to avoid it causing Nadia and Taylor to miss.
Before the Houk can respond, A large Togorian steps forward, holding the twi'lek girl, kicking and screaming, over one shoulder, In his other hand was a clearly modified Deck Sweeper, and he fires upon the remaining Houk. One falls, and suddenly the other two appear to start choking.
"They not so tough." The Togorian speaks in basic before turning around and starts walking back towards the Slips. Painted onto his armor, is a single Blazing Claw.

"DOWN!" Taylor hits the deck as the alien with the deck sweeper approaches. This job, or lack of job just got worse.

As another Houk falls down, Kyle jerks his blaster to the side as a large figure appears. Halting his shot though, he watches a large Togorian gun down one of the Houk, and then watches as the two remaining starts to choke for some strange reason. Reholstering his gun, he moves over to the downed Houk leader and searches him for credits.
*The whole gambling line was a lie, but maybe he does have some credits after all…*
As the Togorian starts to move away, he notices the emblem on his armor, and was certain he had seen it somewhere before.
((Knowledge(Galactic Lore) +7 to see if I can recall any reason why swords suddenly starts to fly of their own account or people suddenly choking for no reason, and I suppose Knowledge(Galactic Lore) would also be appropriate to recognize the emblem.

"Right Then".. says a voice near him. "Who the hell are you?"
The Pince flashes a smile to the Mandalor and the other associated humans. He bows, cutting a leg and waving his hand with a flourish. "I am Prince Gaston de Natulo, Prince of the province of Seladon, Protector of the Great Pearl, and Lord of the Ninth wave.

Nadia seems to be ignoring the Nautolan beside her, her attention directed solely on the retreating Togorian and the girl. Moving past the Nautolan who had identified himself as a prince of some place or another, she hurries to catch up with the Togorian. Her blaster held ready at her side, she stays a meter away. Close enough she can charge at him if he should bring his deck sweeper up to fire.

Within moments, the Speeder Truck is back within the hanger of the *Hope Fades*. The ASP droids spring to life once more, unloading the Proton Torpedoes and Concussion Missiles. Its easy to see the dozen fighters, as well as the two transports that compliment the Diamond-Class ship.

You approach a dirty looking human female using some sheets of durasteel to patch the hull with a fusion cutter. After finishing her current weld, she looks him over. "This is a Pirate ship, Don't exactly take passengers. I know there's a few open crew bunks though. The Cap'n doesn't usually deal with people too well. But you can talk to Lana."
Just then a Speeder truck rushes past to land in the hanger. The female stands up, and stand close against you, she doesn't look to bad in a simple white tank top. Pressing her body against yours. "Of course, you can warm bunk with me, if you like."

The Togorian picks up the datapad, Then laughs loudly. "Everyones going to get a kick outta this." He declares, stuffing it into an open pocket. "Sure we got bunks open. Come along if you want."

Xorra's head perks at the proposition of room and board.  Ever since his previous bed left port, he was wondering where he would sleep tonight.  Engaging in piracy wasn't beneath him, but he was a bit worried about the nature of those he'd be pirating with.  This lot wasn't too bad, perhaps they'd work together.
Quickening his steps, he caught up with the Togarian and his new-found followers.  Xorra had come here in hopes of an opportunity like this.  A chance to make a name for himself.  Maybe his luck was just getting started.  Silently, he followed the group.

Nadia allows Gaston to handle the situation concerning the Twi'lek girl. Pleased with the opportunity to get on the ship she follows the Togorian.
When Gaston attempts to subtly use the Force to persuade the Togorian, she glances at Gaston. Her helmet hides the scowl she directs at him.
*This guy is going to get himself killed at this rate. Sure there's no Empire anymore, but if anyone notices what he is…*

Gaston's attempt to mind trick the Torgorian appears to have failed. Fortunately for the Nautolan he doesn't appear to notice.
"I'm Medrik," The Torgrian introduces himself, as he leads the group onto a skiff. Within moments they were above the assembled craft at the shadowport. Yt-series transports of all makes and models, Many other ships that you couldn't identify, most were smuggling vessels, while others were the ships of Pirates, Slavers, and Bounty Hunters. Scavenger ships moved along the ceiling and cave walls, scooping up the wreckage left behind by those that failed to navigate the JackRab Hole.
Two ships seemed to dominate the hollowed out cavern with the Resh comet, One was your destination, the former Confederacy ship, *Hope Fades*. The other was an older style Marauder Corvette, The *Sweet Victory* was another Pirate ship, this one operated by human pirate Zan Dane.
Finally the Skiff deposits you on the hanger deck of the Diamond-Class transport. There is a lot of activity on the deck, A pair of children running and laughing amongst the Starfighters, while labor droids work at unloading warheads from a speeder truck. Various makes and models of Astromech droids: R2s, R4s, R5s, And even an ancient T3, work preforming routine maintenance on the craft.
Lana walks over to the children, and finally shoos them off the flight deck. The Ubese, Tohs, has already disappeared into the rest of the ship, while Lana addresses the newcomers, Medrik standing close by, finally puts down the twi'lek girl who stopped struggling on the trip to the *Hope Fades* "Go ahead and look at the ships if you like. We keep them maintained as best we can, considering out supply of parts is inconsistent. We're mostly in need of fighter pilots, but there is always room for boarders on Medrik team. I'm afraid you don't get to see the Captain, until after Pops checks you out. Its just the why things are done here."

As they are taken aboard the *Hope Fades* , Kyle looks around as they passes through what appears to be the shipÂ´s main hangar. He doesnÂ´t find anything overly impressive, mainly an array of slightly outdated starfighters, including some of the early TIE models used by the Empire. He finds no sign of the Interceptor though, but then again she is still a serviceable enough craft that she might not have reached the stage where she becomes a pirate vessel just yet.
He listens to the words of the woman who he assumes is Lana, and offers her a half-hearted salute when she is finished.
"Liuetenant Kyle Manson, at your service maÂ´m"
He takes a short moment to look down to the spot where he can still spot the marks where his rank insignia used to be. Times had certainly changed.
"I notice you have a pretty decent line of ships with you. I can assure you whichever of them I will be assigned, IÂ´ll show her my best"

He smiles again. "However... I seem to be in need of quick transport off of this lovely spaceport myself. I am short on cash, but would be more than willing to pay my way though, especially if you are in need of pilots".

Nadia is unconcerned about the background check this "pops" will be running, instead she is silently overjoyed at the prospect of being on the ship. She looks around the hanger and one of the ships in particular catches her attention.
"If you are looking for pilots, then I supposed we are both in luck." She heads over the NovaSword fighter, taking a closer look at it.

As Corran looks around, He noticed several of the newcommers, Particularly the Mandalorian, the Nautolan, and the human that introduced himself as Kyle, seem to be in the need of some medical attention.
Lana looks first at Kyle, and offers him a smile. "We don't stand much on formalities here. Pick a fighter you like, And if you have a hotter hand then the current pilot its yours. Of course, I think your better off just hanging out at the moment. And it won't be to long before Pops gets here. He doesn't move as quickly as he used too."
"Just you step back from the Aethersprite, for a moment boy." Calls an older human male. His hair has gone grey, No effort was made to conceal the prosthetic right leg, even as he walked with a cane. His eyes were bandaged, but seemed to give him no trouble as he maneuvered down the short set of stairs leading from the catwalk to the hanger floor. "I'm not about to hand it over to just anyone."
Lana looks over, and shakes her head, in that ultimate humoring of an older much respected man. Moving over she took his arm and helped him to where the new recruits were. "Okay, Everyone this will go much smoother if you just stand on that yellow line for a second."
The older man resisted her help at first, but eventually relented. "My Name is Silas Draay. But everyone on this boat calls me Pops. Listen carefully and this will go much smoother, and none of you need to get thrown off. Take a deep breath, and relax. Focus on the sound of my voice..."
Gaston and Nadia start to feel as if someone is gently looking into your mind. Trying to pick out some of the little details you might not share openly.

Nadia's attention immediately focused on the one calling himself 'Pops' *Silas.. Draay.. Could it really be?* She moves back to stand with the others. As she feels the gentle touch on her mind she buries deep her true intentions for being on board. Otherwise her demeanor toward what is happening is calm and she doesn't attempt to hide anything else. She decides to let him make his own opinions on what he finds and waits to see what his reaction to her will be.

Gaston imidately senses the interlopers thoughts, similar to what his old Master would do. Stepping up to the line, he begins by clearing his mind of all conscious thought, and sinks down into the oblivion of nothingness.
He imidately begins to think of The Twi'Lek next to him, the smell of her neck, the touch of her skin, how much he enjoyed this morning, and how much he was going to enjoy following her home. He let his mind become filled with the memories of their night together last night. He filled his heart with the truthful joy he felt for freeing her from slavery. Let his pride swell within him for the good that he has done. If he could not clear his mind completely, he would fill it with other thoughts.

Kyle smiles as Lana remarks about the lack of formality. It had been meant as a joke anyway.
"Then weÂ´re on the same page maÂ´am. HavenÂ´t been wearing that title for quite some time now anyway"
Deciding to stick around until "Pops" got around, Kyle looked over the fighter fleet again. She had said he could take whichever he wanted, right? Well, he had been one of the best TIE pilots in his division of the fleet, and unless someone objected, that would be his craft of choice.
As the old man appeared, he relaxed and listened to what the man said, waiting for him to finish whatever he is doing.

Xorra did as he was told.  He left his effects near the entrance and joined the others on the line.  The old man that had come started appraising them.  Xorra couldn't begin to fathom what the man was looking for, but Xorra felt a need to not ask questions at the moment.
Silas looked like he'd been on the ship long before the Empire had come into being.  His age, Xorra guessed, gave him an unique insight into those who would do well in this lifestyle.  Those who were honest enough to not betray their shipmates, those fearless enough to do what needed to be done to turn a profit.

"I see the greed in you boy. That'll only lead to darkness." He says to Lorcan as he walks past the man. Then facing Lana. "As long as he brings it back in one piece, he can use the Aethersprite."
"I see you doing well here. But this ain't the last stop on your journey." He says to Kyle, patting him on the shoulder. Before moving onto Corran. "The *Hope Fades* has a good medbay, and we can always use good men. Medrik is also a follower of the Teras Kasi."
Moving onto Xorra the old man seems to look at him sternly for a few moments. "You..You'll find what your looking for, but will it really be what you need?"

Xorra kept his expression neutral as the old man questioned what it was that he was after.  There was no need to answer, as it would only confirm that he was correct in his observations.  After Silas passed on, Xorra returned to his stuff and sat down on the chest, contemplating.  Where would he fit in here?  How would he fit in?
He knew how to fly, but had never had to dodge laser fire before.  Turning his head away from the others he caught sight of the two larger ships on the deck.  A old derelict of a freighter, and a gun boat.  Their size and strength made up for their lack of agility.  Perhaps a pilot was needed for those.  Xorra kept his interest at bay though, no need to over extend himself just yet.

As the old man walks away, Kyle canÂ´t help be feel respect towards the man. It appears that he has been through a lot. And judging by the sounds when he moved, Kyle guesses that they might share more in common than the man wanted to say.
Deciding that perhaps it would be best to introduce himself, both to Lana, and to the others, he turns towards the group.
"Well, like I said, I used to be Lieutenant Kyle Manson of the Imperial Navy up until a few years ago. I served as squaron leader of Krayt squadron, one of the first squadrons of TIE Interceptors brought into service under the Empire. But after a skirmish with the New RepublicÂ´s Rouge Squadron, I was decommissioned and put to desk job due to "physical incapacity", as they so nicely put it"
Still remembering the particular battle, he unconsciously touches the back of his head.
"I took it for a few years, but when it seemed the only thing left they could demote me to was a mouse droid, I decided it was time to get out. I left the fleet, and have been making my way through the Galaxy doing the odd job here and there since then"

His grey trench coat is ruined in a few spots, holes, rips, whatever you'd like to call them. His hair is cut short to his scalp, buzzed really. He looks over the people and smiles.

"Thank you, I have had quite the difficult day.", he said to Ganthet, showing a nasty cut across his abdomen that had a hasty cloth wrapped around it. "I think it is not that deep. I appreciate any help you could give."
As the human begins his medical application, a much subdued Gaston peers at the doorway where "Paps" has left.  He speaks gently to Lana.
"I am thankful for you allowing me to travel with you. Im not much of a starship pilot, but I flew a YT-1250 for several years around the outer rim. Id be happy to help with that one, if there is no other taker for it. There is more than enough room on board for a good co-pilot and gunner also, so I dont mind sharing it around either".

We've been hitting the transports of the Desilijic Hutts, for a good deal of profit I might add. But now its time for the Big Prize.
"The Imperial Governor of Raxus Prime has managed to acquire a Stygium Crystal large enough to construct a cloaking device. To make a long story short. We don't want them to have it, so we're going to steal it. And you guys get to have the fun."

"Well this should be lots of fun. So we go in grab the crystal and get out, right?" he asked kicking his feet up on top of one of Sparky's legs "Ok well if that the case I want to head out as soon as I can, I'm good and sneaking around so I figure I can scout out a little"

Corran listens to the meeting. He thinks over what he will need to pack for med supplys. "So how is this going to work. Smash and grab or is stealth going to be the way to go on this?" Corran realizes he is new around here and he might over stepping his bounds but getting killed frist time out was just as bad.

Unlike his excitable associates, Xorra sat comfortably toward the rear.  The details of the prize meant very little to him.  Whatever this crystal was, a cloaking device sounded like a useful piece of equipment.  Though the big prize was of little importance, the nature of the job itself was foremost on his mind.  Also, the nature of the information.  The rivalry between the Hutt clans was well known, and to side with one was a double-edged sword.  Hopefully the information was good.

"Best bet, it'll probably be a stealth job. Most of us have certain skills, I believe, that can aid us in our trip there, recovery and escape. As far as resistance, there will be some, but nothing we can't handle." Donovan looked to the captain and re-took his place against the wall, hands behind his back.

"The Crystal has already been delivered, so there is no convoy to hit." Captain Gemthrine told Kyle, "Fourtyfive and I agree, taking the *Hope Fades* into the system would be too dangerous. So you'll be taking in Donovan's freighter. We'll leave the details up to you."

Donovan arched an eye brow. The trip would be interesting thats for sure. He'd give the pilots their checks and let them procede with their tasks. He'd would have liked to speak with Silas before he left, but he could probably manage on his own.
He looked over at the mandolorian. "Your fight with my people, doesn't interest me. I know the jedi and the mandos haven't had the best of terms. Ever. Just know, that fight doesn't, or won't matter to me. Ever. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get the pre flight check done on the Intrepid, or as most of the crew likes to call her, the bolt bucket." He smiled. "Kyle, I'll make sure she's ship shape, but if you want to lend a hand or at least go over her systems, the more the merrier." He bowed his head respectfully.

From the flight deck of the *Hope Fades*, three craft launch. The first is the YT-1250 Commonly known as the *Bolt Bucket*, carrying Donovan, Corran, Kyle, and Xorra. Escorting it are a pair of Starfighters, Nadia's Novasword, and Lorcan's Delta-7.
From the ship's stores, a variety of luxury goods are loaded aboard the transport to give them a legitimate reason to in the system. Corran is able to find a Medkit, as well as a pair of vibrodaggers to fill his needs. (Anything else you want, ask me via PM)
As soon as the Trio of craft come out of Hyperspace in the Raxus System, a flight of Tie Fighters is upon you, hailing the transport, "Unidentified Transport and Escorts: Identify yourselves, and state your business in this system, Then reduce power and prepare for Inspection."

Nadia had been flipping through the holo-images Silas had given her when they had dropped out of hyperspace.

Xorra spent the bulk of his time waving his sword around the secondary cargo bay.  It was a bit lonesome, but it allowed time to pass by a bit quicker.  Also, it gave him a feeling of preparing for their assignment.  Having dull senses was not going to be an excuse he wanted to use, when this team was captured.
The ships revert alarm could be heard throughout the small freighter, and like a child investigating a new noise, he followed it to the cockpit.  Xorra watched from the door way, as Kyle adeptly took the ship safely out of hyperspace.  The group had very little time to discuss the next part, as over the speaker came a commanding voice.
> &quot;Unidentified Transport and Escorts: Identify yourselves, and state your business in this system, Then reduce power and prepare for Inspection.&quot;

"That was quick," Xorra started.  His words both truthful and skeptical of the response time.  "Did we have a plan for this?  Or is it one of those, improvise as needed situations."

The Imperial fighters did a flyby of the trio of pirate ships, You can almost feel the sensors ping off your haul as they identify your cargo. The whole process seems to take longer then it actually does, and the Ties return to they're patrol.
"Freighter Intrepid, your and your escorts are clear to dock with the Station. Follow present course and heading." Come the confirmation that They had avoided trouble as of yet. As you approach the Station, the Outline of the Victory II-Class Star Destroyer, *Boomstick* can be made out against the backdrop of the planet itself. In the ship yard slips, a number of ships are under construction, mostly Carrak light cruisers, but the occasional Lancer-Frigate and Nebulon-B Frigate can be picked out of the mix.

Nadia powers up the engines and follows the Intrepid into the docking bay. *So far so good… I hope they fell for the rouse.* As an after thought she pulls out the blaster strapped to her leg and checks the energy in the power pack.
Once in the bay she powers down the engines and locks down the controls. Opening the canopy, she cautiously jumps down onto the deck of the docking bay and takes a look around.

Leaving the pilots to debate over the situation, Xorra proceeded to the ship's ramp, stopping at the lounge to drop off his hat and cloak.  No need looking the role of mysterious, not here.  The loud hydraulics hurting his hears, trapped in the cramped confinement of the ship.  Before it'd touched the ground he was walking down it, eager to step onto the larger vessel.  There he was greeted by the two escort pilots.  They too seemed cautious about the Imperial motives, but kept dialogue of it to themselves.  With his left hand resting on his sword, he approached the two fighter pilots.  They made an odd couple, in Xorra's mind.  The mandalorian was ever quiet, and watchful.  The other, eager with a touch of over-confidence.
**"Well, we made it here."**  Xorra greeted them with, **"Seems like security is in good working order too.  Always good to know."**

### **Avarna** (2009-02-15 16:28:39)

According to Kyle's experience, There doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary. Having Ties do a fly-by scan of an unexpected arrival is common, Only if things were suspicious would it require the ship being boarded by Stormtroopers.
As the group gathers at the boarding ramp, an Imperial Officer enters the hanger, accompanied by a half-dozen Stormtroopers, with crimson marks on their armor, and carrying force pikes in addition to they're blaster carbines. Trotting along behind the soldiers, is a black colored military protocol droid.
The Officer looks ever the three people that have existed the ship, and finally locks his eyes on Xorra. "I'm Moff Cyclen. If your indeed carrying a variety of luxury items, your arrival could be rather fortunate for myself. Give my droid a copy of your cargo manifest, and I'll contact you again by the end of the day."
With that, The Moff and his men depart leaving you with the droid.

(If there's a roll required, I can't quite think of it.  But I'm sure it'd probably be Deception +14 or Persuasion +9.  He's trying to get the droid to tell him someplace where they might start looking for the crystal, essentially.)

Hanger Deck 4 has been set aside for civilian use. The only other ships in this bay, are a few tramp freighters and a few Uglies that seem to fall apart as you watch them. If there was any starfighters worth taking, they would have to be in the hangers used by the Imperials.
Lorcan and Donovan find the Cantina easily enough, its the only place on the station that doesn't have that aura that just screams "Empire" but even then, the crowd is subdued things like spilled drinks that would cause a brawl in moments anywhere else only causes glares here. As there is a Storm Trooper post just opposite the corridor from the Cantina.
It takes about an hour, for the Moff to signal Xorra. There is no side conversation, as Cyclen speaks. "I will purchase the Cases you have of Corellian Spiced Ale, Tallin Wine, and Bespin Port. And I'll pay you 5500 for the lot."

"I assume you are referring to the Fetts?" An audible sigh can be heard. "The Fett clan makes up only a small percentage of the Mandalorian people. They may be the most well known but they are possibly one of the smallest of the clans." She seems to think for a moment. "And possibly the most aggressive of our warriors."
When the moff contacts Xorra, she looks over at him. "So far everything seems to be going well."

**"Yes, Governor, that will be quite satisfactory."** Xorra realized that Moff Cyclen's offer was on the low end of the product's value, but decided not to haggle over the finer details. There was no sense trying to squeeze a few more credits from the man, when they were gearing up to steal something far more valuable.
**"And, if I may ask Governor Cyclen, would you be willing to consider a trade. I'm sure someone in your position must come across many rare and valuable commodities.

Things were in motion, but was Xorra's plan to survey the Moff's residence going to bring about any fruitful propositions.

"Now that's a very tempting offer." Moff Cyclen replies to Xorra's offer of a trade. "Unfortunately I simply don't have the time at present to properly broker such an exchange. I assume the credits are still acceptable. Oh, and if you could provide delivery to Hanger One, I'll include another 500 credits, for a total of 6000."
At the cantina, Lorcan and Donavan chat amongst themselves at the bar, Over the din of the patrons, Lorcan is able to overhear the conversation: Its between a couple of human males, clearly members of one of the fighter squadrons of the system.
"You hear that they'll be launching the *Immobilizer* in two days?"
"Yeah, from what I hear, they'll be pulling most of the security off the station to cover the christening."
"Nice, so any idea who's going to be on flight patrol...."

**"Of course, sir, credits are always acceptable."** Xorra said with a frown. **"My crew and I will begin unloading the cargo immediately and deliver your items as soon as possible."** Releasing the transmit button, he swore. **"Blast! Not what I had in mind, but I suppose it's better than nothing. I'll call the others back, and we'll make the delivery together."**
Walking back to the *Intrepid*, Xorra keyed Donovan's frequency into his comm. **"Larsh, this is Xorra. Deals been made, and Moff Cyclen wants the cargo delivered to Hangar One. Interested in giving a hand?"** Without much hesitation, Xorra began the long process of unloading the cargo.
(OOC: I'm assuming we either have a cargo skid, or can rent a cargo skid, correct? Something with repulsors so we aren't carrying this stuff all the way to the other hangar.)

Nadia had listened to the conversation between Xorra and the Moff attentively.
"Maybe they will find out what we need there. You can find out some interesting things in a cantina."
She helps him load up the cargo onto the hoverpads and Xorra would see she is surprisingly strong.

Kyle had returned as they neared the end, he posed a question that Xorra answered. **"Yes, we are delivering the stuff to Hangar One. The others should be here soon if you want to join us on the delivery."** Xorra did his best to keep up, but Nadia simply wouldn't let him. Though they had the cargo unloaded before the others arrived, Xorra knew that she had moved most of it. He hid his surprise well, easy when he remembered she was mandalorian. With everyone around, Xorra asked the question. **"Ready?"**

**"Well, we're delivering it to a hangar. Perhaps we'll find what we seek there."** Xorra explained as the four worked to load the cargo. **"If nothing else, it should give us an idea of the force we're up against."** Xorra sat down on the edge of the carrier for a moment. Manual labor had never been a forte of his, and tiring himself out was the last thing he wanted to do if they had a fight ahead of them.
**"Can someone tell me what it is we're looking for?"** Xorra asked, clearly confused about what the cloaking device was for. **"Is this crystal cloaking device for a person? A planet? What? How big is it?**

## Re: Chapter One: Point Nadir

### **Vash** (2009-02-22 16:24:34)

"It's not a device" Lorcan said walking up "It's just a crystal; and I'm guessing that we need to move fast. There's new ship launching in two day and most to the security is being puling to follow it out. Something tells me that that ship is going to get our crystal"

"Hence why I suggested we get some rooms and plan for the next two days, no offense but staying on the old bucket doesn't sound to fun. But hey, whatever gravs your ship."

### **Vash** (2009-02-22 21:30:57)

"No, I think that new ship is going to have the cloaking devise installed. So we want to get before they have a chance to install it." he says walking towards his ship "So I'm don't really care about a room, unless you're paying for it"

## Re: Chapter One: Point Nadir

### **Alicia** (2009-02-23 15:52:16)

Nadia worked on loading the hauler while the others talked. "Lorcan is right. Once it's installed on the ship, if that is their intention then it may be virtually impossible to get it. Once we locate it we should make our move."

**"I would like to point out, that the *customer* is waiting for these goods."** Xorra said, in an overly condescending tone. **"Also, I think all of us should go on the delivery, but I don't think all of us should be *seen* going to the delivery. A half dozen people making a simple delivery might seem a bit suspicious. Not to mention, people who look like they are ready to make some trouble."** His eyes cast over Nadia and Locran. **"As I brokered this exchange, I believe I have a responsibility to attend the finalizing of the transaction. I believe at most, two others should accompany me. Anyone else might be wise to follow at a distance, in case an *opportunity* arises."** It was obvious that Xorra felt this transaction was a chance for some good intel, and perhaps a chance to grab the crystal itself. While the others considered staying here for days, he was pushing them into action, perhaps a little faster than they were accustomed to.
With the cargo loaded, he strapped on his blade and blaster once more. **"Any thoughts?"**

Sparky manages to extract himself from the Aethersprite wihtout issue, and moves over to the computer socket. It bleeps a few times, mostly complaining about Lorcan's fashion sense But does inform you that a complete search for "Everything" about the Immoblizer will take at least 8 hours. (Information to be posted latter)
Meanwhile, a number of you make the trip across the station to Hanger Bay One. There are four Stormtroopers outside the enterence, but don't hinder your enterance. Apparently the Moff informed them to expect the ship ment. As you'd expect from a hanger for the Empire, there is a large selection of craft. Two Lambda-class shuttles, and an Imperial Assult Shuttle, A full squadron of Tie fighters sit in in thier rack. There is even a pair, of what appears to be hyperdrive equipped Tie Intercepters. More Stormtroopers guard the hanger, included by the bustling activity of pilots and techs.
To your suprise, the Moff's protocol droid is present, and guides you to one of the Hanger's Secure storage rooms.

### **ganthet** (2009-03-01 15:03:26)

Corran follows the others off the ship not really saying anything. He wants the bad guys to think he is just hired muscle, which he is. He looks around the hanger and checks things out. There are stromy every where. But they seem to not be to worried about them.
As he walks into the storage area he finds a spot where he can watch the door and not be to far from his freinds if there was anything funny going to happen.

### **Parmenter** (2009-03-02 21:47:00)

Xorra, as promised, went with the group to deliver the Moff's purchase. The journey itself was relatively quiet, and conversation was sparse. It was to be expected, this group had only known each other for a couple days. Trust was slow coming for the others, but not for Xorra. He believed these people had the right intentions, they only required a second opinion on a good course of action occasionally.
Before too long, the cast of characters reached Hangar One. With only a brief introduction, the group was let in by the four stormtroopers standing guard. Inside the doors the group stood idle for a moment, as no one knew where to go next. The hangar was very busy compared to the one they'd just left. People ran everywhere, doing most anything imaginable. The array of craft present was also of interest.
The clacking of metal feet announced the arrival of the protocol droid that had been with the Moff earlier. He greeted the group again, and with an order to follow led them to a secure storage room. Though Xorra hadn't seen the entry code for the room, the mere presence of a code peaked his interest. Only important things were usually locked away.

Lorcan returns to the Cantina. Four hours, and four drinks latter, The bouncer asks him to leave, "Closing time."
As Kyle takes a closer look at the Tie Interceptors, One of them is decorated with a blood red strip on one of the panels. That sort of decoration means the pilot is or was a member of the 181st Fighter Wing, the Empire's most prestigious fighter unit.
As Xorra helps unload the cargo skid in the Secure Storage: There is a large variety of contents in the room. Including several cases that are used for transporting rare crystals, such as Stygium.

Lorcan nods leaving without a word as he heads back to his ship "I really need a better crew. So far most of them have pissed me off. I may have to take a few months to get a new crew though. I'm not sure if the old crew is going to listen to me." he mutters to himself as he walks up to the ships "You know the fact that they doubted Sparky really pisses me off too. The should have more faith is his skills"

## Re: Chapter One: Point Nadir

### **Parmenter** (2009-03-03 05:59:06)

Xorra smiled as his beliefs became truths. With a quick bump into Corran, he nodded in the direction of the crates. He'd believed from the start that this deal with the Moff would be a key component to their finding the crystal. However, with the droid watching them unload the cargo, and being inside an Imperial hangar bustling with activity the likelihood of walking out with the crystal crates here was nil. As was any chance of inspecting them further. It was possible the crystal had long since been removed from it's crate, put aboard whatever ship was to have it, like Locran had said.
As he passed Corran again, he asked quietly, and simply. **"Well?"**

---

## Re: Chapter One: Point Nadir

### **ganthet** (2009-03-03 15:41:03)

"Well what?" Corran asks Xorra. He was playing the part he was there for. No one was hurt so he was actting like he was the gaurd of the ship or was there to send a message. Whatever his part was noone had bothereed to let him in on it.

Meanwhile....
Nadia stays behind to watch over the ships, and ensure that Sparky isn't interrupted in his search. Things are quiet for a long while, when a pair of naval officers walk into the hanger. They are clearly were junior officers as neither of them have Code Cylinders. They make a bee line towards the Aethersprite, and one of them turns to the other. "I Told you, it was a Delta-7 Aethersprite!"
"Fine, Fine. You win." The second one grips putting a credit chip into the hand of the first. "Aren't they Illegal?"
"You know what, I'm not sure. Maybe we should check that out."

### **Avarna** (2009-03-04 23:17:51)

The first officer turns to look at Nadia, And seem to think about it, taking a step forward, he takes a closer look at the Starfighter in question. "No, its not a Replica, Look there, Someone painted over the original insignia. I bet if I ran the serial number though the BoSS, We can end this debate. Might even get the name of the original Pilot, now wouldn't that be awesome."
Its then that Lorcan walks up between the junior officer and his friend. The second man, had pulled out his datapad and started to do a search. But he also took a good look at the NovaSword and Transport. "Sorry, Sir, we didn't mean to cause any trouble. Its just that we don't often see ships like that here."

### **Vash** (2009-03-04 23:22:24)

Lorcan wave his hand "That alright. I know it's a great ship. It's faster than I though it would be. I can't wait to really push it to it's limits" he says relaxing as he sits down and looking at Nadia "So they make the delivery yet?"

## Re: Chapter One: Point Nadir

### **Alicia** (2009-03-04 23:25:47)

The Second officer appears to finish his search, and his eyes grow wide. Quickly he takes a step over to his friend, tapping him on the shoulder and showing him the datapad. The starfigher expert gasps, and the pair starts to back towards the door, keeping they're eyes on the two armored individuals...
It doesn't take long to unload the cargo skiff, and the Droid makes it clear it would be in Xorra, Corran, Donavan and Kyle's best interest not to linger.

Back in Hanger 1:
Kyle starts to strike up a conversation with the protocol droid. Happily the M-3PO turns his full attention to the pilot. "Oh yes, Moff Cylen served with the 181st up until the Battle of Bothwanna. He received a reward for his bravery..."
The droid continues to ramble off the rest of the Moff's service record, as Corran takes advantage of the distraction to slip deeper into the Secure Storage. It would require some sort of scanner to find the case containing the Stygium Crystal.
In Hanger 4:
The Officers make a quick dash to the exit. If there was something actionable in the record of the Aethersprite, its possible that Stormtroopers would arrive at any moment.

"Really? Seems kind of odd to go from being a military officer to the more political role of a Moff. Do you think it would be possible for me to look closer at the fighter?

Suddenly, all the alarms on the station start to blare. They drop a decibel as an announcement is made over the intercom.
"This is Moff Cylen. The Super Star Destroyer *Iron Fist* has entered the system with escorts. We haven't received any communication from Warlord Zsinj, so we don't know what he wants. All combat personnel report to battle stations, We'll immediately start to evacuate civilians as a precaution..
Just then the station is rocked by explosions.
"Orders have changed. Everyone evacuate! This station is taking fire!"
In Hanger 1: The stormtroopers and techs suddenly appear to vanish as they board the available shuttles. Within ten minutes the place is deserted and the shuttles launched.
The reaction in Hanger 4 is slower, simply because it takes longer for the civilian pilots to leave they're drinks, and make for the ships. But a again within ten minutes, ships are preparing to launch.

Getting up with the rest of the civilians, Naroon began looking around for a group he could sneak in with. He'd just hide in their storage compartments until he got to the next place. As he was walking, he noticed the human of some bearing looking over the tie interceptor.

Lorcan couldn't help but laugh as the alarm sounded "Well I was thinking about jetting off early but now I have a good reson. Hey Sparks you ready to go?" he asked looking aty the droid as it locked into place "Ok I'll wait five minutes then I'm gone. Can't be capatin if I'm dead."

Kalor stretched out a hand as the officer extended the 500-credit chip. A Duros lay on the ground nearby, bound, and growling through a gag. Two troopers stood over him, helping him to his feet. One pointed his rifle at his back as the other walked him away, deeper into the barracks.
It was a pathetic fee for a live catch, but of course, it was only a local job. *And* they had fronted the cost for the transport down and back up from planet-side. Besides, Duros stuck out on Raxus like a Human on Nal Hutta. It was too easy, but it barely covered the costs. The bounty hunter wore a curt yellow jacket over a dark shirt and pants. Scruffy, dirty, blonde hair and short grizzled beard matched icy blue eyes. A large blaster was holstered at his hip. The officer held the credits in mid-air, reluctant to deal with those *bounty hunter types*. Of course, nine times out of ten, they got the job done better alone than a platoon of his best men. It was a survivalist's profession, you don't live long if you aren't good at it.
Both men froze as the announcement came over the loudspeakers. As it ended, the officer looked back at the hunter defiantly. Then the ground shook beneath them. Kalor's reaction was precalculated. Snatching the chip from his employer's hands, taking off towards the hangars. The officer looked like he wanted nothing more than contest the act, reaching for his blaster. As the space station rattled once more, his common sense got the better of him as he retreated deeper into the barracks.
Thoughts pummeled the bounty hunter like blaster bolts, the most prominent being, "***What in Hark's hell is going on?***" He was far from distracted as he instinctively made his way into the fourth hangar. Why was a question beyond his own understanding - he just, somehow, knew better than to question his instincts.
Three unattended ships caught his eye in the rowdy hangar bay, NovaSword, crashed one; Aethersprite, Jedi death-trap, probably why the Empire's here; YT-1250, bucket of bolts, but it got the job done. Without a second to reconsider, *he charged up her loading ramp*.
Making a sharp turn towards the cockpit, he caught a glance of the thing he expected least - there was someone there. "**Sithspit**", he muttered loudly at the discernible sound of boots turning on the spot. Drawing his pistol, he took several steps back and crouched low near the entrance to the anterior cargo hold. He had his share of dealing with pirates and hijackers, and it wasn't a pretty business and he sure wasn't glad to be on the other side of that.
One way or way or another, he was going to get off that station.

Sitting at the controls of the Bolt Bucket, Nadia was getting the ship ready for a speedy departure once the others returned.
An unexpected, heart wrenching feeling caused her to suddenly gasp. Something had happened, though what she wasn't sure. With quick motions and a sharp hiss of air, she removed her helmet and set it on the console in front of her. She stood and taking in a deep breath she ran her hands through her short cut black hair. Restless she started to pace. *What is this feeling? I haven't felt anything like it since… since the day, Mother died.*
The sound of footfall behind her pulled her from the reverie and she turned her head. An unfamiliar stood in the doorway of the cockpit, rather surprised as she was to see someone. Reacting she charged the intruder, sending a hastily aimed punch at him.

The station is once again rocked by turbolaser fire, and the lights flicker for a moment as life support fails then the back-ups come online. The artificial gravity fails for a moment, and the station starts to list, the deck plates end up at a 45 degree angle from the gravity well. with a loud screech the ships slide along the deck, bumping into the hanger walls. (No damage to the ships but +5 to the difficulty to take off)
Nadia, Lorcan, Kyle, Naroon, and Kalor are unable to adjust they're footing and fall prone.
Corran smashes through the secure crates, and manages to adapt as the floor lurked under him. Most of the cases contains expensive luxury goods, There are a few illegal weapons in the mix as well. But your eyes are drawn to a single palm sized black crystal, that seems to absorb the light that touches it. Your almost certain that this is the Stygium Crystal you were sent here to obtain.

Dr. Trin Graffi came to gradually at first, but then a shock of panic gripped him and he sat up suddenly, cracking his head on one of the cantina tables. His cry of pain had a note of disgust in it, and he cradled his head as he tried to orient himself. He remembered the klaxon and the evacuation order, and some of the civilians panicking and rushing out. He had stood up to leave, thinking there was no need to hurry. Menin and Eeryth were already preflighting the ship, so they'd probably be ready to fly as soon as he stepped aboard. Of course, that was before he was unconscious on the floor. He remembered a weight crashing against him suddenly as he stepped away from his table...someone must have started a small stampede, and he could feel the spot on his left temple that hit the edge of the table as he fell. Now, as he twisted his body slightly to place his hands for support and stand, he felt a sharp pain across his lower right ribs. He felt the spot carefully. No, nothing broken, but there was a bootprint on his tunic. *Lovely,* he thought, and stood up, unsteady at first.
The cantina was deserted. For just a moment he considered taking a bottle or two from behind the bar, but then decided better of it. He was sure not much time had passed, because his shipmates would have found him before he woke up, but he still needed to get moving. With a sigh of regret, he walked to the door and headed for Hangar 4. When he felt steady enough, he broke into a run. He was just a few yards from the door as the station rocked again and he stumbled and fell. The lights flickered, and as he tried to stand he ended up slamming into a wall as the artificial gravity failed, then came on at an angle to the deck plates. A tremendous screech echoed out of the hangar, followed by an equallly loud crash as ships slammed into the hangar walls.
Trin struggled to his feet, made his way into the hangar and stopped short. The ship he had come in wasn't among the pile at the opposite end of the hangar, or anywhere else in sight. He shouldn't have been surprised, but he was. He spat out a question with all the venom he could muster: "Did those schuttas even look for me?" He looked at the jumble of ships, noting the two fighters, the astromech droid and the remaining freighter. He also noticed two bags lying against the wall...could it be? His long stride carried him there quickly, his boot heels clanging on the deck. As he grew closer, he was relieved to find that one was the beat-up glorified sack he'd been hauling his personal effects in, and the other was his medical bag.
*Well,* he thought, *looks like I'll need another ship, and fast.* He glanced at the sleek fighters for a moment, then shook his head. *No, that would just lead to even more trouble. If I had a fighter and somebody made off with it when I needed it this badly, I wouldn't rest until I had their hide nailed to my door. I'll try the freighter first.* He strode over to the freighter's ramp, and paused at the bottom. He heard some kind of commotion going on, and he thought it might be much more than just the sound of people pickiing themselves up after a fall. Best to be sure, people could be awfully panicky in a situation like this.

Sputtering as the air gets knocked out of him, blaster in hand, he struggles to his feet, revealing a second weapon in his other hand - a familiar silver shaft. He holds his hands over the switch, aiming the blaster as Nadia, the other at Lorcan, as he looks around. "**They'll bring this whole hangar down around our ears!**" he mutters, his cool fading.
He stares down the pair. "**Look, I'm not going to make this easy on you, because I need to get out of here as much as you do, as quickly as you need to.**"
"**Now, we can stand around here, wait for someone to take a shot, have a bloodbath and all more or less likely die, or you can take off now, get us out of here, and drop me off at the closest half-civilized spaceport where we part ways. No-one gets hurt. But I'm not going down, not now, not like this and definitely, not without a fight. It's your call.**"
He toggles the pistol up and down as it's still pointed at Nadia. "**And trust me, I know how to use this.**"

"**Not a Jedi..**" sing-songs Kalor in a muttered whisper, as Lorcan leaves the ship. He deactivates the lightsaber and returns it to his holster, turning his gaze back to Nadia, who still had a blaster pointed at him.
"**Going to put that away?**"

## Re: Chapter One: Point Nadir

### **Alicia** (2009-04-02 17:37:51)

Nadia had glared at Lorcan when he had ordered his droid to fire on her ship if it came to that. *How annoying a man!*
Her gaze quickly re-focused on the man, especially when he holstered his weapon and withdrew a lightsaber all in one quick movement. Upon seeing his blade her own hand habitually went to the hiding place of her own lightsaber, ready to withdraw it with a slight use of the Force. Instead she kept the blaster held steady on him, though knowing full well if he was proficient with the blade he could deflect it, and possibly back at her.
When Lorcan withdraws she lowered her weapon slightly, ready to bring it up. Once the man puts the lightsaber away she re-holsters her own weapon.

It was obviously a question he wasn't prepared to answer, not now, not yet. Following through with an intrinsically inexplicable desire to explain himself, he adds, "**It's a weapon. I use it like you use your blaster, your armor.**"
Noting his folly, he bites his lip, watching Nadia warily. "**Not exactly the best time for this. When are we taking off?**" he asks, as the ship rumbles once more.

Naroon smiles at the human's suggestion.
"Maybe I do."
Naroon reaches into his backpack and pulls out a small rolled bag. He quickly unfolds the bag and pulls out a few small tools of the trade. Quickly prying the panel off near the keypad, Naroon connects several small wires from the starfighter's circuits to the datapad he pulled out of his backpack. Doing so with the speed needed in the situation, Naroon types in a few quick commands to open the fighter's hatch.
(Activate Gearhead to do this in a standard action)
(Standard action: Use Computer check +15 plus a Force Point to Improve Access to the tie fighter. [I'm assuming that's the application])

Nadia's eyes narrow at him at the excuses. "When the others return we will leave."
Heading back into the cockpit to grab her helmet, she checks to make sure the needed preparations to launch are in order. After wiping her brow with the back of her hand she puts the helmet back on. With a short snap-hiss it seals, once again giving her anonymity.
Returning back to where the man is standing she says to him "I agreed we would take you off the station, but you are going to be flying with me." Without another word she motions for him to follow her and disembarks the ship, heading for the NovaSword.

"**The NovaSword? No, no, not even for a Hutt's ransom. My first ship, crash-landed right into Manaan. Drowned. Clinically dead for 2 minutes. Not going to happen. Not again.**" He shakes his head.
The ship rumbles again as more laser battery fire batters the station. Kalor scratches his forehead, obviously rethinking.
"**Err. It's space-worthy, right? Done a few runs, hyperdrive runs well, seals all good, yes?**" A sick grimace appearing on his face, he adds, "**Fine, but don't you even dare think about *spinning*.**"

If only he could see the mischievous look Nadia gave him at the look of spinning, though the fact he looked green at the thought quelled the desire to do it anyways. In a steady voice which belays her expression, she says, "No promises, a roll is one of the most basic defensive maneuvers. But yes, she is sealed tight and works remarkably well."
She jumps into the cockpit and with a final glare unseen at Lorcan and his aethersprite helps Kalor into the passenger seat.

"I have skills that can be valuable to any crew, starting with the fact that I'm one of the best doctors you'll ever come across. I want off this station and you look like you can use some help.

*I haven't spoken anyone from the clan in a long while.

Maybe there's a ship I can borrow in one of the other hangars.* He turned and headed for the rear door, wlaking carefully because of the bulk of his bags. For a moment he wondered if the two people preflighting the NovaSword would be able to overrule the trigger happy armor jockey, but then he decided that if he was going to assume this guy really would shoot him, he also had to assume he'd shoot him for trying to go over his head, around him or whatever else.
The station shuddered again from another round of turbolift blasts, and he slipped and barked his funny bone on the doorway. Gritting his teeth, walked a few meters down the corridor and set his bags down...best to be unencumbered until he knew what hangar he was going to. He started toward Hangar 3, then stopped for just a moment to listen. Were those running footsteps he heard in the distance?
((Perception +9, listening. Definitely going to "hail" anyone other than Imperials who come into range.))

Having completed the slice into the interceptor's security systems, Naroon stood back with a flourish of his hands.
"Tadaaaa!"
Then he looked in the interceptor's cockpit.
"Oh. There's only room for one. Frak! I don't suppose that those friends you were talking to a few minutes ago might have room for one more? Possibly? I really don't want to die here."

(Sorry Vash)
In Hanger Four,
The station rocks again, and suddenly a large chunk of durasteel falls form the ceiling directly above the Aethersprite. The debris hits Lorcan directly in the head with enough force to knock him unconscious. Luck is with him however, as he falls into the cockpit of his starfighter. Thinking quickly, Sparky starts up the Aethersprite, and starts it moving, before the rest of the ceiling collapses atop it. Warning alarms start to blare as the atmosphere containment field starts to fail.
(Two rounds (posts) until the field collapses.)
In Hanger One,
Naroon easily bypasses the security of the hyper-capable Tie Interceptor that Kyle wishes to "liberate" from Moff Cylen. It would be an uncomfortable fit if best, if you tried to get two people into the small ship, (Not to mention not enough connections for the life support equipment.)
However, half buried under crates, there is the second Tie Interceptor that would have been for the Moff's wingman. While it has sustained damage when the station started to list, its still space-worthy. As in its companion hanger, Warning alarms start to blare, informing people of the containment field's impending fail.
(Again, two rounds to get the heck out of there)

(4/5 Force Points)
Quickly looking around, Naroon spots the second tie interceptor.
"That'll work."
Running over, Naroon first checks to see if the tie's even locked.
(Depending on that)
"Of course this one's locked! Why not?"
Pulling out the tools again, Naroon set about slicing into this tie's computer systems to open the cockpit.
(Full round action to improve access to the tie, if needed; add Force Point; Use Computer Check = 1d20+15+1d6)
(Either way)
Looking over at the human he had helped out with the first interceptor, again rushing himself through the process to make sure.
"Get going, I've got this one working just fine. I'll be right behind you."
Naroon climbs into the cockpit, kicking the tie to life.
"Let's see if those hours in the simulator will pay off now. And who was it that said I was just some frakin' academic *playing* at being a pilot? Oh right, that nerf-herding idiot Tam. Well, Tam. Here's to you."
Kicking the tie to life, Naroon lifted her off the hangar floor and rotated her towards the doors. He just hoped the doors were open.
(That might be more than one round)

Trin heard pandemonium erupt in the hangar he'd just left. He ran to the door and peered in, watching as the fighters zoomed away with a roar. *What did I do to deserve this luck,* he asked himself. He ran back to his bags, jerked them off the floor and ran for his life. As he ran he added, *What kind of luck am I talking about? Sure, I can get to the freighter now, but only because I'm probably about to die anyway when containment fails.* He charged up the boarding ramp, dropped the bags and reached for the ramp controls. Then he thought of the feeling in the pit of his stomach when he'd run into this hangar and found his ship gone.
*This might be the dumbest thing I ever do, but I can't do that to somebody else. I'll give the crew of this ship whatever time I can. Let's just hope they're a lot smarter than their boss. I get the sense that he's a special kind of anti-social. I'd better be right.*
He gritted his teeth and waited, looking out the ramp for any clue that they were coming, or that it was time to go without them. The seconds seemed to stretch on for hours.

Trin slaps the hoist button on the ramp control panel and is already stepping over his bags and the jumble of rifles as he answers Corran. "Waiting is the last thing we're going to do, sir. See you in the cockpit when you've caught your breath."
He runs to the cockpit, straps into the pilot seat quickly, checks his panels to orient himself, and carefully increases power to the repulsorlifts. As the ship rises off the deck, he adjusts her angle to the hangar door, then pushes the sublight throttles forward slightly, pushing through into space as the containment alarms blare and the station shudders from more turbolaser blasts.

Being experienced with Tie Interceptors, Kyle easily notices that this ship is more sluggish on the controls then a typical Interceptor. Probably because of the added mass of the Hyperdrive. Naroon's first clue that his machine also was hyper-drive equipped, was an error message, informing him that the Nav Computer was malfunctioning.
Followed by a cloud of debris as the containment field failed, came the *Bolt Bucket*. It catches up with the NovaSword and Aethersprite quickly enough, for an aging transport.
The Space battle was already in full swing. The *Iron Fist* was exchanging broadsides with the *Boomstick* despite the fact that the fact that the Victory Star destoyer was no match for the Super Star Destroyer, and was merely attempting to delay the larger ship as the skeleton crew aboard the *Immoblizer* attempted to flee with a pair of half completed bulk cruisers.

Looking at his sensors, Naroon knew that getting away wasn't going to be easy.

The small squadron of ships make the jump to lightspeed. Its several days worth of travel, before you come out of hyperspace near the Resh 9376 Comet, the hidden location of the illegal spaceport known as Point Nadir. As you approach, your treated to the sight of the Diamond-Class Cruiser exiting the Jackrab hole. The Monster Ion cannon it mounts makes it easy to identify as the *Hope Fades*

Nadia had spent most of the trip sitting back and relaxing, slipping in and out of a Force Trance. Or atleast she relaxed as much as she could in the cramped cockpit of the NovaSword with a passenger who hadn't liked the idea of being in her ship in the first place. Every once in a while she would turn on her bracer computer and look through something though she was evasive about what it was if Karol asked about it.
Dropping out of hyperspace she is relieved at the sight of the *Hope Fades* and perking up she maneuvers the ship toward the hanger. "**Welcome to the *Hope Fades***." She says to Karol and makes sure on the way in to let him have a good view of the blazing claw signet on the ship.
She is in the process of landing the ship when Lorcan's voice comes over the comms. In shocked silence she lands the NovaSword.

It felt kind of odd to make a hyperspace jump from the cockpit of an Interceptor, but the experience was well worth it. After all, it meant they had made it out of there in one piece. Spotting the *Hope Fades* in the distance, Kyle brings his fighter in for landing, transmitting the approach vector to the second TIE.
As he lands, he exits the TIE and waits for the others to emerge.

For an uneventful trip, the hyperspace jump was something of an event.
Boxed into the passenger seat of the NovaSword, it took quite a deal of effort for the once-Jedi not to reminisce. Instead, he occupied himself with silently studying his pilot, who, to his surprise, seemed to nod off to sleep much more often than he did.
Whether it was the hunter's wary sense, the cold sting of space or his Death-stick experimentation period 8 years ago on Coruscant, he simply couldn't sleep. Instead, he took in his surroundings; the dashboard of the NovaSword(and fleeting feelings of nausea), the ebbing bleakness of hyperspace, Nadia's armor, her soft wheezes as she left and recovered consciousness, his blaster(he even took the time to clean it), his growing beard and at one point, a deep-seated interest in an encapsulated ration pill.
He did, in fact, notice Nadia covertly inspect her bracer computer multiple times, but he didn't need to inquire. It was obvious that she was looking at holos of friends and loved ones, or probably something as sappy. "*It's what **normal** people do,*" he thought to himself, frowning introspectively. "*They have people they care about.*"
Leaving hyperspace over Point Nadir, Kalor immediately recognized the constellation - it was, after all, one of the most notorious pirate, smuggler and bounty hunter settlements in the galaxy. Flying elaborately alongside the heavily armed vessel, he could not help but feel that she was appropriately named. "**Yes, hope fades**", he murmured.
Settling softly in the hangar bay, the bounty hunter could barely contain his amusement as Lorcan once more bickered with his astromech - the mischievous droid had done him the favor of broadcasting the conversation.
"**I think Flyboy's droid need a good wipe**," he points out, smirking, as the NovaSword's overhead panel unlocked open.

As the *Bolt Bucket* crossed into realspace, Trin took in the view of the *Hope Fades* and the comet that contained Point Nadir. He wasn't the sort of man who believed in omens, but it seemed clear to him that one of those names or the other was a portent for his future. True, Nadir meant â€œlowest point,â€ but that also meant nowhere to go but up. Or perhaps his hopes were fading...he would have to see. One thing he was sure of (though he had no idea why) was that his destiny lay with this ship for now, so he was going to put his qualms about their business aside and practice medicine as best he could. The fact that this Corran kid had been easy to get along with during the trip over gave him just a tiny bit of optimism about it.
He settled the ship gently on the deck, and as he powered her down he called out, â€œTop floor! Pirates, buccaneers, corsairs, marauders, freelance privateers, space raiders, rovers, wealth redistribution engineers, housewares and ladies' hosiery!â€ Corran was out of his seat and out of the ship before he was finished. Heading aft, he pulled his bags from a locker that he had stowed them in, and made his way toward the starboard boarding ramp. As he walked down the ramp, it occurred to him that he was whistling, just the way he did every time he came aboard a new passenger liner. He broke the whistling with a chuckle. *Happy to be aboard a pirate ship? A ship where one of the crew members was about to kill me a few days ago? Maybe I've just gone crazy. Well, if I have, I might as well enjoy it.*
As he stepped off the ramp, he saw crew members approaching the *Bolt Bucket* and an attractive human woman giving orders. She was walking over to a group of human males that included Corran, and she had the look of an officer. *As good a place to start as any,* he thought, *especially since it looks like we might be going into action right away. They might have casualties for me to take care of before this is over.*
He reached the group as the woman mentioned â€œnew toys and new faces,â€ put his bags down and waited for Corran to answer her question. When there was a break in the conversation, he spoke up: â€œExcuse me, but I'm one of the new faces and you look like the person I should be talking to. Dr. Trin Graffi, at your service.â€

Lorcan stood outside Nadias' room with Sparky right beside him "Well joining this sure turned out to be a lot of fun. Not as much fun as Dad had in his day." he said looking down at Sparky "You see, believe it or not my dad was a jedi and my mom was a mandalorian. They made quite a pair from what I heard but dad also had another jedi friend who's name I can't remember...anyways that not the point. Apparently there was one mission that hm and he friend were on where everything went from bad to worse." he says laughing "It started off with dad trying to act like a smuggler and things just went south from there." he said as he continued to laugh

Nadia's attention returns to what is happening around the small group when Corran is suddenly dragged away by Lana. Turning to the newcomers she states. **"I'm heading to the dorms now if you would like to tag along."** She doesn't wait for a response as she turns to walk away, heading toward the area designated which has empty quarters.
She pauses a moment when she rounds the corner and spots Lorcan waiting outside her room. She turns her head at the newcomers who followed her. **"I believe the empty quarters are marked. Pick the one you want. Excuse me."**
With that she goes to open the door to her quarters, the very door Lorcan is waiting at and goes inside inviting Lorcan in.

Naroon bristles at the suggestion that he *abandoned* his post. "I'll have you know I **never** abandoned my post! My family was falsely accused of a crime and I was drummed out! After that I had to run for my life. One day I'll prove my family innocent and return to that life. One day."
Seeing the attractive woman walk towards the group and give orders, Naroon was simply speechless. He couldn't complete a sentence while she was around. After she left, Naroon heard the woman introduced as Nadia explaining that the dorms were in a certain direction. He followed her and chose an empty bunk room. Once inside, he sat down for a second. He knew he wouldn't be able to rest for too long.

After about ten minuets Lana returned to the Hanger, she was carrying all of Corran's possessions. She handed these off to one of the numerous astromech droids, and it quickly zoomed off towards the crew quarters taking the items with it.

Should anyone wander back towards the airlock, they would find Corran locked inside, naked.

"Okay Everyone, we jump to Hyper in 5, then we have 12 hours before the ambush. I want the Aethersprite, NovaSword and Interceptors Ready by then." She replies to the technicians and droids present. Then proceeds to the Skipray and begins its system checks herself.

Lorcan thinks for a moment before heading back to the hanger deck to find Lana. Once he arrives he had Sparky head over to his ship and start prepping it as he heads towards Lana. "Yo Lana I want to make sure that the Shadow Fire is equipped properly, so what type of ambush are we talking about here?" he asks in an unusual normal tone

"For some time we've been keeping an eye on Rendili Stardrive. They have a prototype mobile spacedock that the Captain would love to get his hands on." Lana answers when Lorcan catches her at the boarding ramp of the Skipray Blastboat, used to carry the boarding party onto prize ships when the situation allows. She was opening up the cover for one of the heavy ion cannons.
"Anyway, The just screwed up. Rendili rented it out to a group of scavengers to gather operational data. What they didn't know, is that the scavengers owe Zietta the Hutt a lot of money." Lana continues with her face in the ion acceleration assembly. "So amounts to a Repo job. We take them back to Zietta, and keep the mobile spacedock for ourselves."

Deciding he had been resting long enough, Naroon walked out of his new bunk and back toward the dock.
*Just in case I ever need that interceptor again, I want it to have a functioning navcomputer.*
As he walked through the halls, he saw the one called Corran walking along, proud as a Hutt, stark naked.
*What kind of ship **is** this?*
Finally making it to the dock, Naroon overheard Lana saying to get everything read for an ambush. Without another word, he walked over towards the interceptor he flew in on and began looking over the systems.

Spending some time in her quarters Nadia prepares the letter she had been putting off the last couple days. It was longer than she had expected it to be, though she had left out specific details as to what she was doing and where she was. when it was finished she wasted time looking over the rifles Corran had handed her, making sure they were functional.
She felt the ship jump into hyperspace and with a sigh she slung the newly acquired disruptor rifle over her shoulder, leaving the pulse rifle in her room and headed back to the hanger.
Everyone was busy at work making sure the fighters were ready to go so Nadia went to hers to make sure everything was prepped. She also listened, seeing what she could learn about what was happening or had happened on board the ship.

"Take your pick." Lana replies as Kalor asks about a way back to Point Nadir. But just then the large ship lurches as it enters Hyperspace. "But It might be a long trip."
Only then does she look up from the Ion Cannon, and spares a movement to wipe lubricant from her hands. "You want work, I have a Cutlass-9 that needs a Pilot, and the Boarders always need more bodies. So take your pick, or suck it up until we find a convenient rock to dump you off on."

Seeing Lana talking with one of the guys he'd met earlier today, Naroon decided he needed to ask. Hopping out of the interceptor, Naroon walked over to Lana and said, "Hello. Naroon Graf. Nice to meet you. I... I was just curious as to whether or not you had a spare nav computer. If it's not too much trouble. The interceptor I flew in on has a bad one and needs to be replaced. I've been trying to repair it but not gotten anywhere. Also, do any of these other ships need work? I'm pretty good with machines and computers." He began to look down at his feet. "That is, if, you know, if you need another engineer, that is."

After Kalor's outburst, Lana looks at him with a cold stare. "You get Room, Board, and a Share of the take, just like everyone else. If you have a problem with that, Take it up with them."
Lana points behind Kalor, where the entire hanger has gone quiet. There are about 20 organic technicians in the hanger, plus 35 astromech droids. All of them were looking directly at Kalor, Some of them had blasters drawn, others were simply wielding large hydrospaners. Even the droids appeared ready for a fight. "We watch after our own here."
Lana then turns to Naroon, She smiles friendly at him, "Nice to meet you, You'll have to check with Tosh about the Nav computer. But its always nice to have another engineer aboard. Although from the readings Goldie took, its repairable."
(Kor, your eariler checks are enough to repair it)

As people dissmisses around him, Kyle gets to work on his newly aquired ship. He would need to get specialized parts of course, in order to improve it significiantly, but at least he could get rid of that disgusting paint job, which would turn this ship into just another TIE fighter to most eyes.

Kalor wasn't one to be intimidated, he pushes back just as hard. It was difficult talking over the silent glares of the hangar occupants, but he knew better than to accept something for granted.
"**Last time I had someone watch over me, I was dumped on Kessel with two hours of air and half an energy-pack in my gun. I look after me and me**", asserts the hunter, pointing the thumb of a fisted hand at himself. "**Now I'll be the one sitting pretty in your Mess [hall] while you change your mind. Do let me know when you make that stop over a *convenient rock*.**"
Satisfied, Kalor finally made his way out of the hangar, moving to explore the inner bowels of the ship - should he find a common area, or a mess hall, he makes up an *Aitha* and sips it quietly.
Trust wasn't something to be expected, it was something to be proven. He had learned that the hard way.

Nadia walked in right as Kalor was storming out, heading right past her. The silence on deck palpable. With her helmet on the frown she gave him was hidden. *What kind of trouble has he gotten himself into.* With an inaudible sigh she approached Lana.
**"I have a feeling he's going to be a troublemaker."** She says turning her head back toward the door, then she looks back at Lana. **"What's the next mission, boss? I assume that's where we are headed."**

Naroon turned around and looked at the navcomputer at Lana's mentioning of it being reparable. "That might be true, but it could also do with an upgrade. I'll see what you have in stock first. Thanks."
Turning towards the direction Lana had pointed him in, Naroon walked towards the crew person he'd seen. "Tosh, right? Hi. I'm new here and was wondering what kind of navcomputers you had just laying around. That one," he points at the interceptor, "has a reparable one, but it's a basic one only. If you happen to have a better navcomputer just laying around, I'd be happy to install it in the interceptor myself. So, do you?"

Kyle has an easy time finding what he needs to remove the distinguishing red point from the Tie Interceptor.
Lana looks first at Lorcan, "We don't know what to expect, so we're preping everything. The fact that they need a mobile spacedock says they're at least working on something big, but by Fourty-five's calculations, it shouldn't be battle ready anytime soon."
Then the woman grows sad, "I'm sorry. I thought you might have heard. Pops isn't with us any longer. It was weird, his body just faded away."
Tosh is currently working on one of the starfighters when Naroon approaches. When he pulls his head out it becomes clear that Tosh is a Ubese and the Chief Engineer. "20,000 credits is the going rate for an advanced navicomputer, You pay up, you can have."

Trin laughed as Lana dragged Corran away. *Well,* he thought, *the boy's certainly got a bold streak. I hope he didn't just grab a Krayt Dragon's tail.* When Nadia announced she was heading for the dormitory section, he nodded and followed, wondering at length what she looked like under that helmet. He placed his gear in one of the simple rooms. After cleaning up quickly and a change of clothes, he locked the door of his quarters and went to the medical bay.
((Avarna, my plan is to check out the medical bay, then return to the hangar bay and talk to Lana and/or Tosh about ships. I doubt that's going to throw your timetable off, but if it will, let me know and I'll do an edit on this post.

Naroon heard the Ubese's price and squeaks a bit at the price. He pats his pockets for a show. "Ah, I see. Well, I'll go make due with what I've got, then. Thank you." He heads over towards his new interceptor and begins the repair work to the navcomputer. "Fix it up, work it out, make it do, or do without."

After a bit he heads down to the hanger hopeing to aviod a repeat of last time he was there. He looks for the deck officer, she should be around here some where she seem to live in the hanger bay most of time. When he finds her. "Lana you know where I might be able to dump this for some credits?" Corran didn't have any interest in keeping the weapon it wasn't his style.

One thing was apparent to the Doctor. This wasn't what you'd expect from a pirate ship. The place is clean, and all the droids you encounter seem to have a cheerful disposition. Children run along the halls playing happily, unconcerned for their safety. Even the Weequay, Houk and Gamorians among the crew were treated with respect.
---------------------------------------------------------
"Yeah, If you could go see to that new flyboy you brought in, and Make sure he doesn't cause any trouble until he's ready to be useful." Lana says after taking a deep breath and smiling once more at the other woman. When Corran came to her offering the Lanvarok.
The woman smiles, and rolls up her sleeve, showing that she already had one of the strange weapons. Corran Immediately wonder how she concealed it earlier. "I'll take it. 3000, plus next time I won't lock you in the airlock."

Nadia gives a small shrug and goes off to find out where Kalor went off to. Not caring if Lorcan followed along. It took sometime but she eventually found him in the mess. Grabbing a bottle of whiskey and a couple glasses she approached Kalor, taking off her helmet when she reached his table. **"Share a drink with me?"** 
She didn't wait for him to respond as she took a seat, balancing her helmet in her lap, and poured a healthy helping of the whiskey into each glass. Setting one of the glasses in front of Kalor, she takes her own.
**"Nu kyr'adyc, shi taab'echaaj'la, Silas Draay."** she says, holding the glass up in a salute before downing the contents. The whiskey not affecting her in the slightest. She sets the glass down heavily back onto the table.
**"What do you plan to do now?"**

Trin was whistling again as he walked through the corridors. He'd developed the ability to "read" a ship's crew and passengers as a survival skill early on in his career, and this ship was reading as a better place to work and live than some of the luxury liners he'd served aboard. He certainly hadn't expected to have any pediatric patients aboard a pirate ship! He made a mental note to review some of his pediatric texts and some of the texts on Weequay, Houk and Gamorreans--he hadn't treated a Gamorrean since...when? Oh yes, that cantina fight on Ord Mantell. Nasty business.
*Hope the med bay is as nice as the rest of the ship,* he thought, and made his way there.

A free drink is something you take with caution. That Kalor had learned, the hard way, *yet again*, after some nasty business on Florrum.
Now a free drink and a pretty face; deadly.
He did nothing but stare as Nadia brought in the bottle, claimed a seat and took her first drink. In honor of something or other, as far as he could tell. Feeling defiant, he shifted aside the pair of stained Aitha glasses and picked up the glass of whiskey, swirled, and followed suit, draining it in one swallow.
"**What do I plan to do now?**" He repeated. It was obviously the question that's been running through his head for the last few hours. "**Well, if history tells us anything, then chances are I'm going to find my way to one of the cornerstones of uncivilized civilization, drown myself neck-high in Ale for a night, get up the next day and find some more work. Another man trying to find his way in the universe.**"
He frowns as he finishes the sentence, looking distasteful, swirling the empty glass. "**Wonder if Gorga's hiring.**"

That last drink went straight to his head. You'd think someone with his background would've lasted a little longer, but no, he was already getting quite tipsy. Taking a moment to *shake it off*, he nods at Nadia to refill his cup, and guzzles that down too. Mandalorian or not, she wasn't about to out-drink him. He clears his throat audibly, keeping down the foul-tasting fluid.
Kalor listens quietly as Lorcan talks at him, making out every few words. Finally, he shakes a finger as Lorcan closes. "**I offered my skills,**" he declares. "**But I still need my pay.**"
"**To Pops**", he declares quietly, raising a third glass. He waits for the others to follow suit, before draining that glass, coughing up then too as the drink burned his throat. "**You never *really* told me who Pops was.**"

The alcohol was already starting to affect her but it seemed to be doing far worse to Kalor. **"Pops was one of the captain's right hand men. He weeded out the troublesome thugs who wanted to join the crew to make sure those here would be safe.** She paused a moment as she made sure the top of the whiskey was secure. **"He was alaso known as Silas Draay and he was my mother's mentor during the last years of the Clone Wars."**

"**Silas Draay..Silas Draay.**"
Kalor repeats the name twice, the first time, as though in stupor, the second with a much darker tone. Visibly snapping out of his numbed state, he stares at Nadia with a burrowed frown. "**This..Silas Draay, Pops? He was here?**" He broke the stare as suddenly as it had been made, intentionally looking away. "**How did he die?**"
In deep, disturbed thought, it was obvious that the bounty hunter had made a troubling recollection, and as he had feared, his expression had already given him away.

As Corran arrives at the med bay. He looks around to see if anyone was there. "Hello? Anyone here?" He sets his shock staff in a corner and puts his med kit and coat on the chair by the desk. "Well I quess I should get started doing something." He picks up a data pad and starts to do an inventory of what medical equipment and supplys they had on hand.
(OCC: Corran is going to work in here untill something happens or he is needed somewhere else.))

Silas Draay's room.
Kalor sat on the ground, leaning against the far wall next to a strewn chair. Blood red streaks filled his ice-blue eyes as tears dried on his cheek. He was staring adamantly across the room at an open chest. His lightsaber had fallen alongside it, but it wasn't what interested him. Though he couldn't spot it from his perspective, he could still feel the Force waves emanating from the recently imbued item, which was still lay undisturbed inside the chest. He daren't touch it, not yet, there were amends to be made first.
"***Perhaps I can help***", reassured the Mandalorian woman. Kalor looked up, confused. What did she know about becoming a Jedi? True, **he** had been her friend and mentor for longer than he had ever known his own son, but still, as ignorant as Kalor was, he couldn't even fathom what Nadia could've known about his plight to come.
Kalor's connection to the Force had dimmed increasingly over the last twenty-five years. He struggled with where to begin. "**What? How can you help?**" asks the Jedi.
One thing was clear however, there were first amends to be made.

Nadia continues toward him, having been surprised herself to learn who Kalor was. *Silas had a son?* It was all rather hard to believe, but perhaps not. Silas was still a mystery to her, as he had been a mystery to her mother. A mystery which would remain such now that he was gone.
**"I told you my mother had been his student during the Clone War."** She hoped he would understand what that meant, but she said it anyways. **"She was a Jedi."** From behind her back she pulled out the lightsaber Nadia had tried to hide there.
The lightsaber hilt was wider than most, with the activation switch set near the top. The hand grip consisted of a protruding spiral piece offset by beveled glyphs following along the spiral to the bottom. The grip looks worn and some of the glyphs have been darkened from use making some more pronounced.
Nadia came to sit down beside Kalor, her back resting up against the wall. **"She taught her children everything she knew."**

Kalor looked at Nadia in surprise, then at the lightsaber. It was unique, special, not like his own generic padawan lightsaber and more like his own father's,though he had glimpsed briefly. A Jedi's weapon. His hand moved to touch it, but he stopped and pulled back - though it had been a long time, there was always an etiquette to lightsaber construction and handling, and as it were, another Jedi's lightsaber was off-limits without due necessity and permission.
"**You're a Jedi?**"

Nadia frowned at the question and drew her knees up to her chest. Showing just how flexible her armor was. Marina may have taught her children the Jedi way, but they also learned what it was to be Mandolorian. Some of their ideals did not mix.
Finally Nadia looked at Kalor. **"The Jedi Order is gone."** She paused and looked back at the saber, turning it in her hand so she could read the glyphs. **"I was taught the Jedi way, but I was given the choice on what ideals to accept. I carry this lightsaber to remember my mother, as she carried it to remember her first master, Firith Ven, and as a reminder of the Jedi code she valued."**
Glyphs read:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.
Jedi use their powers to defend and to protect.
Jedi respect all life, in any form.
Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.

Kalor inspects the glyphs with great interest. When he's done reading, he turns his gaze back to Nadia.
"**It's beautiful.**"
He smiles meekly, drawing his blaster pistol. Like to Nadia's relief, he keeps his finger off the trigger, and instead, crosses his legs and lays it on the ground in front of him. "**Let's see if I remember how to do this.**"
Running his hand down his face, wiping away a moment's sorrow, he closes his eyes and focuses on the pistol.
<span style="font-size: 0.85em;">*Feel the Force flow through you.*</span>
The pistol remains perfectly static for what must've been a minute, maybe two, and then quickly, it rattles on the spot, the barrel rising into the air the smallest of a distance, and just then, Kalor looses a breath and opens his eyes, and the blaster instantly drops still.
"**Heh**", he smiles. "**Not quite as easy I remember. Last time I did that proper, I was nineteen years old on Ord Mantell. My first bounty, Weequay called Ohn Vidra knocked a blaster right out of my hand and threw me to the ground. Charged right at me.**"
He frowns in deep thought. "**I shot her, twice, right in the chest. Fell over me, bleeding out of every orifice.**" The dark look on his face holds, as he recollects his first kill.

With a nod, Nadia stretched out her legs, crossing them in front of her. **"My father and I took great pains to retrieve it.** She pauses not going any further than that. Her thoughts are interrupted when Kalor pulls out his blaster and attempts to levitate it with telekinesis.
She sees him concentrate on it intently and it moves slightly. He exhaled heavily from the effort and speaks of when he last used his abilities, a dark look on his face.
**"Killing is never easy to deal with. Never should be."** She watches him for a moment, before extending her hand and calling the lightsaber he had dropped to her empty hand. **"The question is, what have you learned since then that will keep it from happening again."** She holds the hilt of his saber out to him, offering it to him.

Kalor half-smiles. "**I'm not sure..yet, but I have a feeling I'll find the way again, but not until I've faced up to what I've done in the past.**"
"**I never killed. Not if I could help it, but it never really mattered, I might as well have. You don't pay a man to bring someone who's wronged you back unless you intend to make their life miserable.**" He sighed. "**I wasn't strong enough, after the Purge, but maybe this time will be different.**"
"**You asked me before what I was going to do now. I think I'm going to stay, learn what I can about him**", he continued. "**He was a Jedi, he had a reason to be here. I think I need to see it through.**"
"**Look at me talking about destiny,**" he adds, his smile widening.

Nadia watches Kalor and nods slowly, before getting to her feet. **"Come, ner vod. Let's get you settled in."** Putting her lightsaber back into its concealed compartment in her armor, she reaches down to help him to his feet.
Once again she offers his lightsaber back to him. If he doesn't take she puts it with Silas's in the trunk, closing the lid.

Kalor watches as Nadia got back to her feet, and took her hand as she helped him to his. Finally realizing that she was trying to hand him back his lightsaber, he hesitated for a moment then took it back. Both pistol and blade secured to his belt, he finally makes a request.
"**I think..I think I want to stay here. For a while,**" he declares. "**Do you think Lana would let me keep these quarters?**"
"**I think I'm going to need to have a word with her about that work she offered.**"

With a nod, Nadia places her helmet back on and leads Kalor out of Silas's old room and to where there are empty quarters.
**"If you would like me to come with you to speak to Lana, I'll be in my quarters."** She points down the hall to where her room is. Without another word she turns and heads there to sleep off the minor effects from the whiskey.

Kalor tries to sleep for about an hour to no avail. Though his body was more than willing, his mind was not about to let up. He had questions, and he knew where to find the answers.
Leaving the quarters, and making sure the hallway was clear, he quietly makes his way back to Draay's quarters. The room was exactly as he had left it. Closing the door behind him, he heads directly for the large chest. Carefully shifting aside the tray with the lightsaber, he proceeds to rummage through the remaining contents of the chest, looking for anything, a datapad, a journal, a disk, anything that could tell him more about the man that was once his father.

Time passes quickly. Those that can rest, those that can't simply spends their time preparing the ship, or simply conversing with each other. At the 8 hour mark, they stopped serving intoxicants and most of the fighters were declared ready to launch. At the 4 hour mark, the two Intercepters, The Aethersprite, and the Novasword were added to Ready Status, and Non-combat personal were evacuated to a previously unseen Kappa-class shuttle, which promptly launched.
One hour before dropping out of hyperspace, the fighters pilots were ordered to report to their snubfighters. The faster moving fighters are moved into quick launch position. Mission briefings are handled on the fighter deck...

Naroon, not quite sure if he was counted as a fighter pilot, reported anyway, since he knew that an interceptor would be valuable in a star fight. He first made sure that he had his normal gear, both for slicing and for mechanics. One never knew what one might need. He also slung on his utility belt, put his datadagger, which looked like a code cylinder, next to his code cylinder in his utility belt. Finally, he also loaded his hold-out pistol into it's sleeve holster, ready for a draw if needed.
Naroon arrived on the flight deck a little winded. It had been awhile since he'd worked out on a regular basis. He noted that he'd need to again.

Having spent most of his time since the return to the *Hope Fades* in the hangar, working on his ship, getting accustomed to her systems and generally maintained her, Kyle showed up for the briefing pretty quick. In the ragged flight suit he still wore from his days in the Imperial Navy, no one would probably have taken him seriously if he said he was a fighter pilot. Especially since he had made a point of removing all insignias and markings that detailed him as a professional soldier.

Trin sits on his bed and checks his gear one last time...the fifth time in the past hour. His heavy blaster is in a holster at his hip. A stun baton hangs from his belt. In the pockets of his basic flightsuit he has a comlink and two extra power packs for the blaster. His medical bag straps are adjusted so he can wear it like a backpack. The six pockets hold 5 medpacs and his surgical kit, and he's crammed his datapad in an corner of the bag's interior.
There's a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He's been in combat a couple of times before, but those situations were defensive, imposed on him before he had time to think. This time...well, he had done everything he could think of in the med bay and still had too much time on his hands to think about it.
*This is what this crew **does,** Trin,* he thinks. *Get used to it.* He stands, deciding that going down to the hangar and checking over the Skipray again couldn't hurt. As he passes the medbay, he sticks his head in the door. He notices that Corran isn't around, but Corran isn't the one he's here for.
â€œSix, it's time to go.â€
â€œYes, Doctor.â€ The IM-6 droid trails him down the corridor. â€œI'm ready for action.â€
â€œI hope we all are, Six.â€ Soon they reach the hangar bay, and make their way to the Skipray Blastboat. Trin notices that Lana is gathering people for their briefings, so he drops the medkit by the copilot's seat and heads over to the gathering crowd. He catches Lana's eye, and whether he feels it or not the typical confident smile is on his face. â€œReady when you are, boss lady. What's on the agenda?â€

Kalor hardly sleeps a wink for the whole trip, instead, studying his father's old war journals intimately. A great pilot and a cunning warrior. To his dismay, he finally reaches the end of the tale as the Clone War ends, finding only references to an elusive *Holocron*(he did not recognize the term).
Frustrated with the lack of information about Silas' life beyond the Wars, Kalor finally considered resealing the chest, before finally catching sight of the Master's lightsaber. With apprehension, he reached out for it, and picked it up. The cool blade felt warm in his hand; *righteous*.
To claim his future, he would have to make amends for his past. He would walk his father's path, the Jedi's path and stave off both their shadows, with only that symbol of light in his hand as both weapon and guide. He knew where to start.
Seeking out Lana Stormsender, he had wandered back to the hangar, only to find many the crew congregated there in flight-suits. He recognized a few faces; Nadia, Lorcan, Corran("**Lucky son of a Hutt**", he smiles) and that pilot, Kyle. Lana was preparing to make an announcement.

Corran stands listening to the briefing on wha they where going to do. "Lana I am going to head in with the broading party. I am not really much of a pilot and they might need a medic." Corran's hand moves down to his med kit which is still field with the supplys he took last time. He looks around at all of the people around him they where alittle disorganized but pulled off there last mission and this one should be not be too different.

"That sounds good Corran." Lana says, before stepping into the semi-circle formed by the gathered pilots. From time to time she glances at her datapad.
"Alright, We're going to be ambushing a group of Scavengers that owe the Hutts. Since they currently have in they're possession a prototype moblie Spacedock, it reasonable to assume they're currently working on something big, and we have no way of knowing if its battle ready. We also expect at least a dozen Uglies, but with scavs you shouldn't place bets on what hardware they have.
"The captain wants the Spacedock intact, and the Hutts want them alive. So fire only if fired on first, and then try to disable instead of destroy. Merdic and his boarding party will go directly to the Dock and secure it. We'll be mixing up the parings since we have so many new faces. You'll be informed of your wingmate once your strapped in.
"Don't take chances, I want to see everyone of you again. Yes that includes you Murtiash. So unless there are questions, go load up."
(Each fighter pilot will be paired up with an NPC wingman. The wingman will use the Aid Another action every turn unless instructed otherwise.)

Lana turned and looked at Kyle first, Clearly annoyed. "We don't know any specifics. But like I said in the briefing. There is no telling what Scavengers might be flying, but we're guessing Uglies built out of newer designs."
She then turned to Naroon. "Sorry Kiddo, but if you don't fly the Interceptor then I'll find someone who will. Those are the newest fighters we have."
Finally she looks to Kalor. "Listen, We take the occasional job from the Hutts, and in return they leave us more or less alone. We have this job, because the *Hope Fades* Pirates have a reputation for being disciplined and trustworthy folk. And they knew the risks when they started.

"Let's just say that unlike you, my problems are all my own bloody fault. I came from a high class family, high level officials who had served the Republic for generations, and then served the Empire. They didn't want me to be a doctor, but they paid for my schooling, and I did well at first. But between my ego, a little too much after hours drinking and my problems stemming from beautiful women, I was bounced out of a number of hospitals and research facilities. I never had any problems with patient care, it was always the personal things, or telling the wrong administrator where to stick his datapad."
"Eventually I became the medical officer on a passenger liner, and it really agreed with me. I enjoyed seeing the galaxy, fine foods, gorgeous women, romantic settings...but my old habits followed me, and the ships got smaller and smaller and less and less luxurious. After a while I ended up doctoring in fringe settlements, and a few times I joined smuggler crews and served as their 'face.' That's what I was doing when I got to Raxus, a Star Destroyer showed up and...well, here I am."

"Yes it is." Lana confirms for Kalor, before making a motion with her hand. The rest of the pilots seem to know the meaning of it, and dash off to their designated fighters. A smelly looking Dug who was going to be flying the TIE fighter, takes over the controls of the TIE Interceptor that was Naroon's.

"Alright. Lets get this thing buttoned up and ready." With that the rest of the boarders start to climb into the Skipray, that has been modified for this purpose. "Medics stay behind the Techs, who stand behind heavy gunners, who stay behind Grenadiers, who stay behind Me. Got it? Good."

When Nadia approaches Lana about a co-pilot, the older woman stop for a moment and looks around the hanger. There were few organic technicians still working, and Lana apparently wasn't pleased with the choices. Finally she smiled. "Lee, get over here."
An older looking LE-series repair droid walked over to the pair. It was painted in a variety of colors, almost as if the children aboard the ship had used him as a painting project. "Yes, Mistress Lana, how may I assist you?"
"You'll be flying with Nadia, in the NovaSword." Was her reply.
"Oh, This is exciting news indeed." The droid replied, turning to look at Nadia. "And a pleasure to meet you, Mistress Nadia. I'm LE-EE, and with your permission, I shall get ready to depart."

Nadia considers the droid for a split second. If Lana believed the droid would perform satisfactorily then how could she complain. **"Get to it then, please."** With a nod of thanks to Lana she followed the droid back to the NovaSword and finalized the preparations to depart.
She watched the multi-colored droid assigned to her with mild curiosity. It had obviously been around for awhile considering its condition. **"Lee, have you been playing with the children?"** she asked lightly.

Kyle ignored the DugÂ´s rude comments, and climbed into his own fighter to prep her for launch. He preferred to have a wingman who he liked and could talk to, but he could fly this thing solo if he wanted to.
As they revert into normal space, he launches the fighter together with the rest of the crew. Acknowledging the "donÂ´t fire unless fired upon" command, he kept his fighter at a distance, using the ships sensors to try and scavenge as much data about the opponentÂ´s ships as possible.

At the go signal, Kalor fires up the engines. Half expecting the ship to falter then possibly explode to his grim end, to his surprise, the engine comes to life smoothly, as the console gives him a clean take-off notifier. The last to leave the hangar, Kalor hangs back to follow the Skipray.

Kyle sensors read the Uglies as being of Unknown Type (Not a big suprise considering these ships are a collection of random parts) They are shown to have no shields, and only one weapon system. Someone a little more tech savvy can tell you they are what are known as TYE-wings, the ball cockpit of a tie fighter with the engine Nacelle of a Y-wing.
The squadron of twelve fighters begin maneuvers to get target lock on the Pirate Starfighters, even as the Mobile Spacedock attempt to fire upon the *Hope Fades*, the monster ion cannon aboard the ship returns fire.

The experienced group work though the halls quickly, and soon are at the heavy blastdoor leading into the control center. A two person crew starts using a Squib battering ram to make it though.
As Naroon, Corana and Trin, bring up the rear they find many of the scavengers. More are stunned then killed, and most of the stunned ones have secured with mesh tape.

Kalor's wingman breaks off to join Nadia and hers, and the trio manages to destroy the Uglie that had hit her earlier. Kalor himself manages to destroy the one he'd hurt earlier.

It had taken a week to find the Hope Fades. Most of that time was just travel time. Once at Point Nadir Sulvar knew exactly where to go. He sought out Laery Druval knowing he would be able to tell me where to find Hope Fades. After the couple hours to locate Laery, Sulvar quickly made his way back to his ship coordinates in Y5. He needed to know what had happened. He never thought he would feel that familiar presence he had always felt in the back of his mind wink out. Once in orbit he made the calculations and jumped to meet Hope Fades.
Reverting back to real space Sulvar sends his recognition codes. "Captain Gemthrine this is Sulvar. Do you copy." Mutters "Gemthrine what have you gotten into this time..." While he waits. he locks his S-Foils in attack position.

"Sir, Sulvar is asking to speak with you. Merdic reports they have control of the Spacedock bridge." Call the pretty Zeltron girl running communications.
"Tell Sulvar to either shoot something, or get out of the way." The Duros replies, clearly not having the time to speak to the run-away pilot.
"Yes, Captain." She replies, transmitting the message word for word to the Cathar, along with the proper codes for their allied fighters.
"Transmit over open: Scavenger starfighters: We have taken control of the Spacedock. Surrender now and your lives will be spared. Gunnery Crews, Start targeting the Citadel's." A chorus of "Yes Captain" runs though the bridge.
*********************************************************
((I Will say this one last time: The splash on Missile weapons is for CHARACTER scale, not STARSHIP scale.))
Several of the faster Starfighters make it into range of the Headhunters, as those same starfighters target them. Lorcan manages to hit one of the Z-95s but they prove to be sturdier then the Uglies. Nadia barely manages to make it into range, and fires hitting another. Kyle fairs no better, as his target manages to avoid his lasers. The missile fired by Kalor makes the only kill, connecting with the Headhunter already damaged by Nadia's Novasword.
The Citadel's don't fair very well, as they come under the fire of the heavy Ion and laser batteries of the *Hope Fades.* In a single shot from the monster ion cannon, one of the small cruisers is disable, and a second is reduced to particles as both laser batteries tear it apart.

As the target narrowly avoids his lasers, Kyle turns his ship around, stalking his opponent in the traditional attack approach used by TIE pilots. Casually sliding his hands over the sensor board, he scans the other ship, trying to find anything out of the ordinary with these ships. After all, Z-95Â´s were quite outdated.

The *Knell* could hardly match the speed and maneuverability of the other craft present in the battlefield, but, in Kalor's mind, what it lacked in speed, it more than made up for in defense. Coupled with the pilot's relative ease of mind in the cockpit, he was confident in his ability to get what must be done, done.
Where'd he learn how to do it? Tales vary. For one thing, when you hijack a *NovaSword* while evading a Feeorin with a temper at age twenty, even if only to later crash land on Manaan on your way to Nar Shadaa, you don't stop to watch the instructions holovid. There were a great many things that just came naturally to the son of Draay; maybe it was just the way of heroes.
Smiling as he hears Kyle's comment, Kalor maneuvers his ship to tail the NovaSword, locking onto it's target Z-95.

The *Hope Fades* took some solid hits from the turbolaser battery from the Mobile Spacedock. One of its two hangers is now open to space, and its engines are bleeding radiation. Already Tosh and his engineers are in spacesuits and work pods seeing to the damage.

As his second missile ran out of fuel, fizzled out and exploded harmlessly after trailing a Headhunter up till the edge of the battlefield, Kalor finally took a breath.
As everyone else seemed to cry joyously over their comlinks, he stayed silent, not even confirming the new order as he moved to comply. The surge of the battle was over, giving him the peace of mind to contemplate the consequences. A great many men were shown their maker, and a few more a Hutt's fate, by his hands. He didn't share the jubilance of victory - it felt like another day on the job.
He finally managed to get a closer look at that spacedock. He had been to the other side of the galaxy and back, but had never seen anything like this - it look like someone had snapped an arm off of Kuat Drive Yards, slapped on an engine, and pushed it off into space.
The Cutlass-9 trailed the other fighters into one of the two Hangar bays. Landing promptly, he left the cockpit of the *Knell*, and drew his blaster, eying the pilot of the X-Wing suspiciously.

Nadia landed the NovaSword behind Lorcan without further fuss. Getting out of the cockpit she saw the x-wing pilot for the first time.
**"Lee, stay with the *Shereshoy*."** Without waiting for a response the Mandalorian woman approached the new pilot.

With a quick movement Nadia rounds on Lorcan sending a punch straight for him. Her gauntlets sparked with energy as they toned down the damage from her punch slightly.
**"Seems I could show you a thing or two myself, vod'ika."** As she turned her back to him and moved away from Lorcan she mutter loudly enough for at least Lorcan to hear. **"Ori'buyce, kih'kovid."** And though she turned her back to him she kept an eye on him in the event he decided to do something rash, but in the end giving the appearence she was unconcerned with whatever Lorcan decided to do against her. Having turned back to Sulvar she bows ever so slightly to him. **"Nadia Skirata."**

As his fighter pulled down on the spacedock behind the others, Kyle felt really good about himself. It had been some while since he had seen action in the cockpit, and while this fight had been quite the pushover, he had still enjoyed being back where he belonged. As he exited the ship, he saw several of the others gathered. He raised an eyebrow a bit, as he saw Lorcan take a solid punch from Nadia. He wasnÂ´t really surprised though. His limited experience with the man hadnÂ´t exactly put him in high regards with Kyle, and had pretty much labeled him a jerk.
Deciding to let them sort things out on their own, he headed for some of the boarding crew he spotted.

One other thing is very noticable about Sulvar's X-wing, and that is the freshly painted New Republic symbol on both wings and the fuselage. The small hanger isn't nearly as large as those aboard the *Hope Fades* meaning that it has yet to be converted fully into a starfighter carrier. Six huge OG-9 Homing Spider Droids stand vigil over the hanger.

As he passed the newly arrived X-Wing, Kyle shrugged a little. Hopefully whoever piloted it wasnÂ´t affiliated with the New Republic military. While his disgust of the Empire was what had lead him to leave it in the first place, he had no particular liking for the New Republic either. After all, it was by their actions his life had become what it was. And ever since that run-in with the rouges, he had never liked the sight of an X-Wing.
Now wasnÂ´t the time to worry about that though, and he unholstered his gun as he followed the others. He tried to recall the layouts of the *Diamond*-Class ships, as he usually had a knack for remembering such stuff, and after all, he had just spent the last days aboard one.

Kalor's eyes widened at the sight of the droids. Far-outnumbered, there was no tactical defense for the time being. They had to hold the line to avoid being flanked. Tossing his own glowrod to the far-side of attackers and drawing his own lightsaber with his off-hand, he levels his blaster at the closest of the droids, squeezing off a spray of blaster fire from the miniature firearm.

Sure, he had plenty of experience with power generators, shield generators, engines, hyperdrives, bulkheads, blast doors, droids, automated turrets, computer consoles, and various other mind-numbingly complex machinery, but he didn't feel his skills were relevant to this particular task. In fact, they were completely irrelevant.
