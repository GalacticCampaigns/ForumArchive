# [Into the Storm] Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-08-30 18:15:40)

It is the beginning of 25 ABY. The light Corellian freighter, *Starshade*, is on a hyperspace course to Vjun. The passengers of this ship have come together under alliance for a top secret mission. The passengers are of Jedi and Republic affiliation. The people on board have been through a lot together, but they have just recently reunited for this mission. The last time they were all together is when the Jedi, Jes Mur Eva, led two rival wookiee clans back to unification and prosperity on Kashyyyk. As a result, she was promoted to Jedi Knight. Throughout the Jedi's journey's they have been trying to unravel the corruption of a scientific branch called Falsoor. They have recently gained a vague lead from Jedi Knight Lues Van, formerly known as Rith Bendar. The lead has guided them to Vjun.
Jedi Master Kel-Yun Lorhas chose to follow Lues's lead, and requested military backing from the Republic. The Republic responded with only a squad of six, since the nature of Lorhas's mission had no real substance. Reluctantly, he accepted the support he received and decided to go to Vjun. Jedi Knight Mur Eva had left contact with the Jedi Order a year ago, and Lues Van believed he felt her presence on Vjun. He also believes she has discovered something key to their prior investigations of Falsoor, he just doesn't know what.
The squad from Lt. Baruush's 2nd Platoon was pulled from ship duty aboard the Republic cruiser, *Dark Stallion*. They were doing ship-raiding practices when they were abruptly given a real mission. The young calamarian lieutenant told them to pack their things and follow her to a Jedi's transport, and now they have been on the *Starshade* for a few days in hyperspace to Vjun.
At this moment, Awne Tora sits in the centered cockpit of the corellian ship. She is in the pilot's seat monitoring the hyperspace lane on the navicomputer, surrounded by ambient beeps and whirs. It was funny how relaxing the ship's functions seemed to be. The viewport with durasteel linings seemed like the only thing between her, space, and the wall of luminescent-blue aura that is a hyperspace wormhole. That and the vast assortment of pilot instruments and panels that went belly-high to her. She glanced at her friend Vor'en in the co-pilot's seat, it looked as if he had managed to finally gain some sleep between mission preparations. However, none of the other passengers were in here.
Everyone was asked to stay in the main hold for now, as there was some planning going on between the Jedi and the lieutenant. The main hold was the best space to congregate on the ship. It had a dejarik table sitting in the left corner of the hold, with a padded booth around it.
About 20 feet to your right is some computer instruments and a wall panel of buttons to monitor ship functions. There is a swiveling chair next to this panel. A few steps across the computer resided the refresher room. There were two doors into the main hold; the back door led to the main corridor. The front door led to the freight loading room. The main hold was about 9 meters long and 5 meters wide. The floor was shiny black plasteel that had been scuffed from the passengers pacing about. The ceiling had parts, wires, and pipes jutting around in a juxtaposed manner. None of the parts seemed to dangle near a person. The walls were mostly covered in some sort of mechanical piece or computers, and the background of the hold had a dreary gray look or blackness to it. It seemed a distinct social barrier was between the squad of soldiers and the jedi as everyone waited patiently to arrive on Vjun. Perhaps it was time to start making proper introductions.

Blue eyes of the fargul glance over to the human in the seat beside her, a smile coming to her lips as she watches him sleep. She sighs, leaning back into her chair, relaxing slightly; it was good to see the human sleeping for a change, he hadn't been getting enough, not that he let it show; still he couldn't hide that from her. Awne sighs again, blowing a stray piece of hair from her eyes as she shifts in her seat, crossing a leg over the other and moving her tail to the other side, giving a long sigh at the new, far more comfortable position.

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 01:09:30)

Getting sleep was something that Vor'en hadn't been able to do very much of in the past weeks. Most of his time was spent turning the motley crew the Republic had given him in to a fighting force that might actually make it thought it's frist battle.
Still it was nice to be working with Awne, Woro and Hardu again. He knew these people well he knew what they where capable of in a fight. The others where good at there jobs, even with the ruff old drill sargent yelling orders and making them run the same drills over and over. Still they where getting there.
Vor'en had alot of practice in his life at making men into soldiers and he would keep doing it as long as it was needed.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-08-31 01:14:29)

Awne gazes into the blue worm hole, seemingly lost in thought. Strangely, you can hear a loud creaking sound on the hull outside. Awne checks the status of the ship and it seemed there was an internal problem, she couldn't locate it just yet though. It didn't seem like a huge problem now, but it could become one. The creaking of the hull is enough to startle Vor'en awake.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 01:20:24)

Awne mutters to herself, she had just been ready to get up and walk around and now this! "Damn it...I hope we have a mechanic hitting the things only go so farr.." she mumbles, standing and moving out to the main room looking around "Any of you know how to fix a crreaking noise frrom the hull?" Her hands were on her hips, and foot tapping, yes she learned patience but somethings never changed.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 01:29:33)

Vor'en's eyes snap open and he looks around hand moving to his blaster. Then he realizes that there is no danger. He looks over at Awne. "What we hit?"

---

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 01:32:32)

Awne glances back into the room "nothin, something's crreaking, and I dunno what it is." she frowns.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-08-31 01:33:38)

Vor'en's eye is caught by a flashing screen on the main instrument panel in front of him. He can see Awne turn around as he is coming back to his senses.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 01:44:16)

"Oh, well this old bucket has alot of creaks and groans." Vor'en truns back around to make himself comfortable. "I amazed that it makes it as far as it does." The old soldier pulls out a cigar and lights it. "I am sure one of those guys in the back might beable to fix it." Taking a big draw on the cigar he blows it out. He knows Awne hates the smell of them, and she will complian about and use her mojo to try to take it away, But he doesn't care he smokes them anyway.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 01:53:26)

Awne turns at the smell of cigar smoke, growling at the blasted thing before grinning; hey she had to practice on *something*. She raises her hand to the cigar and grins as she wills the force to take it from his hand and from him. "Vorr...you know those things arre bad forr you."

---

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 02:07:15)

As the cigar moves from Vor'en's grip he smiles. "I see you have improved your controll some, the frist time you tried that you ripped the front half off." Looking at the cigar floating in the air. "You realize those thing are expenceive enuff without having to replace them sooner because of your need to keep alive longer."
"Besides these new guys might get me killed long before that cigar will." Vor'en smiles at Awne, he knows she means well and he would do anything for her willing to sacrfice his life to save hers.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 02:12:04)

Awne frowns at the notion of the new recruites "tch....have to go thrrough me beforre they could get you killed." she sighs and lets the cigar come back into reach "oh fine, herre...I still think you could find something healthierr..."

---

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 02:21:39)

"Darlin' I run into battle with men shoting at me." " I have faced death more time then I care to remeber, but if it will make you happy I will try to cut back." Vor'en winks at her and truns his atention back to the screen with it blinking light. "And I have allready told that if they get me killed they have to answer to you."
((OCC: Computer use D20 +8 to see what the blinking light is.))

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 03:13:54)

Awne chuckles and leans against the doorway watching him "hope they know I won't go easy on them like you do, old man." she grins and moves over to him, laying a kiss to this cheek "and you betterr cut down orr I'm hiding all your cigarrs." she whispers before leaving out the door in search of a mechanic.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-08-31 04:02:53)

Awne travels through the cramped cockpit access corridor, past the main corridor and into the main hold. She sees the army squad, Woroken, and Hadru all pacing or engaged in idle chatter. Lorhas, Feldon, or the lieutenant were not here at the moment. The dejarik game seemed to be off, no one seemed interested as social tension seemed to mount.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-31 10:17:30)

The large wookie grins toward the Farghul walking back through the hold. He had always been fond of the "mother cat" during their prior adventures. Jedi training seemed to be good for her as well--she was much more in control of her fiery emotions now than in the past. "How are things, Awne? Has the old man sparked up again?" he joked, knowing too well Vor'en's penchant for smokes, and the Farghul's disdain for same.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 13:01:00)

Awne scowled at the mention of the blasted cigars "one of these days I'm getting him off of them.." She sighs and looks around to the small army, glancing at eachone in an effort to learn faces, names could come later. "I need a mechanic, the hulls making a noise that's putting my furr on end." she says simply. Indeed her training had been doing wonders for her temper, making the farghul far more calmer then before; as wel lit seemed the proud woman stood ever taller with the notion of Padawan under her belt, along with her blaster and lightsaber.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 13:11:24)

Vor'en chuckles as his friend leaves to find someone to fix the hull. He slides over to the pilots seat and checks there course and heading.

"I'm no help there," Woroken says, looking at the soldiers to see if anyone could help, and pausing to listen to the sound Awne described. He also was noticing to see if any of the newcomers gave a hint of understanding his shriwook. That would be something important he needed to note for future reference.

## Re: Starshade

### **master_Tru** (2008-08-31 14:02:04)

Off in the corner sits a young man against the wall with his head resting sideways. Possibly asleep and if so a sound sleeper. He stands out wearing only about half his uniform though his rank is clearly viable. He looks a few articles of clothing away from being a regular civilian. To most the red star tattoo over his eye stands out the most not a common trait at all in the galaxy. But as Awne scans the faces within the hold she senses something more to this "solider".
Lances continues his silent meditation, though not in the usual jedi cross legged fashion. His training was rapid but contained real value and now serves him well. Unlike when he first started his training Lance is easily able to continue through the distractions around him.
"How are things, Awne? Has the old man sparked up again?"
"I need a mechanic, the hulls making a noise that's putting my furr on end."
Vor'en chuckles
"I'm no help there,"
Lance hears it all but continues his focus, even letting out a slight and low snore for cover.

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 14:23:00)

Awne pauses in her scrutinty of the crew, her gaze landing on the sleeping one in the corner..sleeping? well..it was a long trip..it's possible..then again what was that feeling something off. Not one to pass up a chance to meet/haress a new crewmate, she moves to him quietly. Stepping carefully so her heels wouldn't click too much on the floor. Once close enough would she crouch down beside him, looking him over more carefully. The star was interesting to her, looking it over many times before finally poking him, hard. "Hey, Starr boy, you a mechanic?"

## Re: Starshade

### **galenbd** (2008-08-31 15:33:12)

The grey-furred Bothan sits off to the side. Kor's adopted a posture, most humans think is relaxed. It's actually a bit uncomfortable for him, but at least his companions are more at ease. Since the discussions seem to be non-existant or randomly occuring, Dor keeps his awareness relaxed and open. Speech seems unnecessary and at least will not inhibit the inflow of information. Trying to keep from flaring his nostrils as he tastes the recycled air, he just seems even more alert. Hearing the pilot complain about the ship's hull creaking, he looks up from his datapad as she walks past. Seeing her attention focus on the human...ummm..Lance maybe...he keeps his peace. She'll get around to him eventually.

## Re: Starshade

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-08-31 16:11:32)

As the farghul entered the hold, GorÂ´Ak looked up. Having been mostly an idle ride, he hoped that her arrival would mean that something was about to happen. It seemed, however, that she was looking for a mechanic. Of all the skills he had aquired during his years, that was sadly not something he was good at. He was hoping that he would pick up some skills in that area as well, since most thing mechanical had a tendency to break down when you needed them the most.
As for now though, he was content to just sit and watch. The lot of the people in the hold seemed to be at least somewhat experienced, and he hoped they would measure up to what was required of them when it was time. He had no thoughts that he might not, and as long as he was payed, the bothan would put his skills at the RepublicÂ´s service.

## Re: Starshade

### **master_Tru** (2008-08-31 17:06:21)

In his happy place Lance continues his meditation sensing into his feelings the ship the space around them and the crew inside. Lance considers another snore when he senses Awne`s intent to disturb the young mans "slumber" but then thinks twice on the matter not believing that the would would cease anyway.
(poking him, hard)"Hey, Starr boy, you a mechanic?"
Still with his eyes closed Lance pauses a moment and grumbles a little keeping up the cover of slumber. Eyes still closed Lance replies "Its Starfell not star .... (Lance opens his eyes to see Awne for the first time) Lance Starfell that is, and no I am no mechanic sorry." Lance extends his hand in a customary hand shake "And you would be?"

---

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 17:52:49)

After checking the curse Vor'en switches on the ships internal comms. "Any luck back there Darlin' ?" He hopes there might be a mechcanic back there that would help. If not he would have to take a look.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-08-31 18:08:27)

It would seem the group of soldiers and jedi have a developing problem on their hands. The soldiers are not even sure why they are the ship on the first place, and some had considered asking the jedi what was going on. Everyone seemed to be wondering what was keeping the jedi knights and the lieutenant behind closed doors for so long.
As thoughts race through the passengers mind, the ominous creaking sound can be heard again.

## Re: Starshade

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-31 19:47:21)

The wookie stands up and lets out a loud yell at the top of his lungs, to get everyone's attention for Awne. "Pay attention, everyone," was what was said, but he had a feeling that message spoke to even those who did not understand him. He then pointed to Awne, wanting to make sure the ship was examined post haste.

---

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 19:56:09)

Awne blinks at the human "Starrfell then, orr would you prrefurr Lance?" She takes the offered hand and shakes it "Awne, Awne Torra." She sighs and stands, tail twitching in annoyance, she needed a mechanic. Her ear flicks to the com at Vor'ans voice and sighs, moving to answer him "still looking Vorr.." She glanced over the others as she spoke, moving past the wookiee she mumbles "oh boy...dogs.." in reference of course to the two Bothans.
Tail puffed slightly, arms crossed below her chest she looks over each soldier; blowing a stray peice of blond hair from her eyes "Look I need a mechanic and I need one now....Arre any of you one?"

### **galenbd** (2008-08-31 22:19:23)

Rolling his eyes up toward the hull, Kor blanks his datapad and stashes it in a pocket.
"Ma'am, perhaps I can help." he rumbles. "You got an idea where that racket is loudest?"

---

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-08-31 22:42:14)

Awne raises a brow to the Bothan, tail moving by her feet in flicks. "You'rre a mechanic pup? good, I don't know wherre it's coming frrom only that it's inside somewherre. Come on we can go looking forr it." she moves to the com system and pushes the button "Vorr I got one, we'rre gonna trry and get to it, any idea wherre it is?"

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-08-31 23:56:12)

"Give me a minute and i will have your answer Awne." Vor'en looks over the ships senors looking for where there might be a problem. "If you guys want to start looking go right a head just don't bother the Lt about it would want to have her blow a gasket before the mission starts."
Vor'en wonders why he hasn't heard anything from the so called brains of the operation so far maybe they found the bottle of Corilian whiskey he kept back there. Who knows. "The rest of you had better make sure that your gear is ready to go. I want you guys looking and acting like a unit before we get where we are going."

## Re: Starshade

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-01 03:14:30)

Happy that another guy was taken away for mechanic duty, GorÂ´Ak turns his attention to the sergeant.
"And where exactly would that be, sir? So far, it has been quite scarce with information regarding our actual mission"

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-01 04:24:56)

*Staff Sergeant Vo'ren has just recently been added as your squad leader. So, this would be your first time meeting him. You know nothing about Vor'en and that may be a spark of skepticism for some of you. Formerly, your squad leader was Staff Sergeant Jakin Sears. Sgt Sears was just recently promoted to Sergeant First Class and your platoon sergeant. None of you have combat experience except for Vor'en. Your only experience in your military careers is basic training and training with the Dark Stallion cruiser in the NRDF 2nd fleet. Vor'en has direct command over the squad while Lt. Baruush has command over Vor'en.*
Before Vor'en walked into the main hold, he ran a routine troubleshooting program inside the cockpit. It was revealed that the regulator in the hyperdrive was not working properly, and the inertial compensator was being overworked. Although the problem was not immediately harmful, it could be if left unchecked.

Hadru sensed the tension coming from the soldiers and tried earnestly to appease their questions with the reassurance that the members leading this team were good officers and orders would come soon enough. Explaining that he had served with them before and they were some the best soldiers in the Republic Hadru tries to keep the men's morale up.
Hadru wasn't exactly in uniform himself wearing a mustard colored scarf stained with blood and dirt that looked faded from wear and tear. The scarf was tucked neatly under his coat colar, but it stood out and could not be missed. When Anwe entered the hold looking for help Hadru didn't bother to volunteer because he skills lay elsewhere. He wasn't sure of the mission, but his presence meant recon or they just needed another crazy solider to fire a rifle at something.
He heard Awne talking to the tatooed man named Starfell. He wasn't sure why but he was drawn to him, but he resisted the urge to disturb the solider as it look as if he didn't want to be bothered. Instead he moved to his old wookiee friend.
'You think they ever seen a Wookie before...' Hadru jests to Woro 'I think they are little on edge, that one over there jumped off his feet when you asked for there attention, I think maybe they don't understand you.' Hadru smiles
Hadru extends his arm to shake his furry arm in a firm friendly handshake
'Its been awhile Woro.'

Woroken grabs the hand of his old friend, and shakes it a little too hard in his excitement. "Great to see you as well, kid. Well, I guess you aren't a kid anymore, are you? It's been too long." He claps Hadru on the shoulders in a warm greeting, then motions to the closest table.
"Any idea what we are here for, Hadru?" the wookiee asks in what would appear a whispered tone.

*This one has some fight in him!* she thought to herself as a grin spread across her face, she'd not been too fond of Bothans but this one was starting to grow on her already. "I'll call you pup if I like to." she says in a whisper to him, standing and turning making her sure tail flicked at him as she said "Come on now.." she grins and looks back at him "Prrivate, lets go find out wherre that noise is coming frrom." She grins over to Hadru and Woro, giving a small wave of her tail before walking out.

Vor'en sets the ship on auto and heads back to tell Awne about the problem. Hearing the complliants coming from the Bothian he heads there direction. "I would watch it kid, Awne bite is more then a match for her bark." "The problem is with the regulator in the hyperdrive. As far as the info goes I don't know much more then you guys do, the big brains havn't told me anymore."
"My name is Vor'en, I have been with the NR army in a part time compasity for awhile now. Now I am full time like you guys. I know Woro, Awne , Hardu and the other Jedi on board." "the rest of you can tell me about yourselve when your ready. i will tell you one thing though we are all walking away from this and I mean everyone that is that clear."

Awne nods her head, though her grin moves to a half frown, "the hyperrdrrive?" she sighs "add a new one to the list of parrts we'll need. Hopefully the pup herre can fix it." She looks back to the Bothan and grins at him, oh yes, she was enjoying this. She pats her old friend on the shoulder as she passes him, heading to where the hyperdrive would be.

*Could you guys put your important stats in your signature like Awne has done? Remember to track ammunition as well, such as 50/50 shots in a pack.*
Awne takes the mechanic and Vor'en out of the main hall and through the cramped main corridor. Their feet clank the grated-metal beneath them. They pass by the closed circuitry bay as Awne and the bothan spot something curious beyond the curved hallway. They can see a grated panel popped off from a compartment in the floor. *Awne and Dorijidan each gain 100 experience.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-01 13:59:32)

Awne quiets her mind and can sense absolutely nothing in the Force. She feels the life of the other passengers on board, but that is it. She walks the entire circle around the circuitry bay in the corridor and sees nothing wrong. All she is able to see is an empty compartment. The bothan was standing right in front of the engineering bay where the hyperdrive was located. Awne walks in front of the bay and stops, while keeping an eye on the compartment.

Awne shudders slightly, mumbling to her friend and pup "I don't like this, makes my furr stand on end.." she motions a free hand to the enginnering room and looks to Vor'an "something isn't sitting rright with me.." She nods to the door "lets make surre it's clearr."

Vor'en cautiously walks through the curvature of the circular main corridor. He looks at the ceiling covered in mechanical parts and scours the grated floor beneath him. He checks behind computers and panels throughout the hall. Once he gets to the compartment in the floor, he sees that is big enough to hold about two medium sized people and that was it. Vor'en continues on and checks the observation deck where the quad-guns resided and there was noting suspicious there. He stops at the engineering bay next to the others, his search was complete.

"Figures...if you want any decent info, you have to get it yourself. Just so weÂ´re clear though, IÂ´m not exactly a full-time soldier in the army. The were running short on soldiers and they hired me. No more, no less"
He throws a glance towards the path the farghul and the other bothan had walked down.
"Perhaps I should go and take a look as well...IÂ´m not very good with machines, but itÂ´s always good to learn"
GorÂ´Ak rises to his feet, and starts to follow the two others. As he reaches them, he sees that the farghul has pulled out a lightsaber.
"Whoa, I thought this was just a technical malfunction"

She was starting to get a bad feeling, her tail puffed and waving to show her unease, eyes fixed on the door. breathing deeply she attempts to send her senses into the room beyond, searching through the force to whatever may lay beyond.

As Lance shakes Awne`s hand a perplexed look comes across his face. As the woman turns to the rest of the crew still searching for a mechanic Lance disregards the confusion he senses from the Furgul woman. Thinking to himself I am no mechanic â€¦.. Maybe I could help in other ways.
Lance continues his meditation but this time focuses on the current situation looking for any possible clue that may aid them.

Sensing the rising tension in the group Lance puts a hand close to his blaster.

Gor 'Ak pushes a button on the door console next to the large engineering bay door. The door hisses open and you see the typical two large blisters of the engine at the back of the bay.
The bay was about 3 meters long and 15 meters wide. The doors to each cargo bay are flanking the two large engine blisters. In between the two hulking engines resided the hyperdrive. The engines let off a quiet hum of energy as they were functioning. The humming of the engine gave the bay an ambient feel. The room was very spacious and the ceiling had the usual configuration of wiring, piping, and parts jutting throughout the area. The hyperdrive itself was a rectangular mass of durasteel and other high-quality metals, with a blinking status display box on top of the rectangle. There were paneled barriers that protected the moving parts of the drive and the left panel was popped off. Parallel to the hyperdrive on the left was a shocking sight.
A bronze droid lay prone on the grated floor. The droid had a plasteel shell and two thin, long leg appendages. It had two arms with a wrist-weapon of some type. Its mid-section was black material, and its top-half was bronze plasteel. The head of the droid was without a neck, and it had a long black line for its photoreceptors. *You could identify it with a knowledge technology check. Otherwise, you are not sure what type of droid it is, other than its a combat model.* The droid seems to be deactivated and it has a hydrospanner in its hand. You can get a smell of something that had been burnt.

Awne searches the expansive engineering bay, and nothing in the room stands out to her except the prone droid. Everything in the room seemed to be in good order, the only sign of tampering was with the hyperdrive. If the computer was reading right then the regulator inside the hyperdrive was malfunctioning, and this is probably the source of the problem.

"Sweep the area, someone check out the planel make sure everything is ok, if you can fix whatever it did do so." Vor'en looks over the driod and around the room. Pulling out his commlink he sets it for the ship internal comms. "I want someone that can pilot in the cocpit now, I want gaurds posted in all viteal areas. Call out when set." "Woro you and Hardu make sure everything everything is secure then inform the Lt. that we have a problem." "Move it people."

Dorijidan carefully goes over the walls of the engineering bay. He looks pass the computer panels beeping and whirring trying to find some hint as to what's going on. He feels very confident he is systematically searching the engineering bay. He can't find anything pertaining to the droid or the hyperdrive in the room though. He looks into the main corridor, and can see nothing in eyeshot that stands out or looks suspicious.
Lance stretches out with the Force. He senses everything is fine at the moment. Nothing the group is doing presently will bring about negative repercussions. The Force continually speaks to him, calming his nerves a bit as he feels enlightened on the current situation.
Gor 'Ak looks over the droid but isn't that knowledgeable about droids to see if anything was irregular about it. However, he is able to find a small connection port on the droid's lower back. Huttese text begins scrolling down on the datapad.
Dorijidan finishes his search and returns to the hyperdrive. He expertly accesses the status display of the engine blisters and hyperdrive. He is able to quickly determine that the regulator has been tampered with, and it is putting gradual strain on the inertial dampers. Eventually, you estimate that the strain will kill everyone aboard if you either fix the regulator or come out of hyperspace. The ship could either fly apart or the G force would crush everyone aboard. The subspace engines seem to be working at 100 percent capacity. *Dor gains 100 experience for his expertise on mech/computers.*
Woroken walks across the engineering bay to the cargo bay door where the meeting with Lt. Baruush was being held. The door was locked, it seemed they wanted privacy. *Woro hasn't knocked on the door.*

The docking bay door slides open after Woroken finishes his report. The aging Jedi Master walks out with a caring look on his face. The human male had his brown beard well-grown and trimmed.
He had piercing brown eyes and confidence of a seasoned Jedi. His skin was of a light-tan complexion. His hair was neatly cut and brown, with a touch of gray beginning to show on the sides. The master stood at about 5'10. He wore a tan Jedi tunic encased by dark brown Jedi robes and dark brown boots. His lightsaber that was clipped to his belt had a dish emitter and was silver with black paneling. He stopped next to Woroken and began stroking his beard, looking at the fallen droid.
Lorhas: "Hmm, it seems like a case of sabotage. Though I do not know what happened to the droid. I can't sense any immediate danger anywhere on the ship, but I suggest we search the ship from bow to stern. This bothan should stay monitoring the ship functions and then somebody should further investigate the droid. I would carefully examine the droid and make sure he does not have any traps on him. Once you do that, I would consider looking into his records. What do you think Woro?"

"Well, if I am going to reactivate this thing, at least I want to make sure it doesnÂ´t have any routines telling it to kill us all. If you can keep translating this thing maybe we can make sure that doesnÂ´t happen"
Just in case though, he replaces his heavy blaster in its holster, and instead pulls out his ion pistol.

Lorhas: "I actually wanted to see how'd you handle the situation Woro. But for now, let's get this in motion. We need to let these two handle the droid in case he has a trap on it.

Quickly wanting to change the subject, he approaches Awne and makes an attempt at a whisper: "I see you have already found a new group to mother.

All of the jedi and soldiers collectively search the ship systematically from cargo bay to cargo bay. They work up through the starboard side to port, the center, and consolidate at the front of the cockpit access tunnel. Despite all your combined effort, you find nothing in the ship that seems out of place or hostile. It's safe to believe that is clear. Vor'en and Gor 'Ak continue to work on the droid.

He entered the general hold where the soldiers had gathered post the ship search.

Woroken travels to the other end of the ship in the cargo hold. He goes through the plasteel cylinders with food supplies. He's able to find water in containers and dried food stuffs. Woro refreshes himself with a low-quality meal.
Back in the main hold, a young Jedi with short-blonde hair walks into the room. He has blue eyes and pale skin with features on his face that made him appear stern. He is wearing a white tunic with a black belt and a lightsaber clipped to it. His boots are brown and the pants were tucked into it. The man seems to have a very helpful and kind aura to him. He gestures to the men sitting at the dejarik table, along with Awne, his apprentice.
Feldon: "Greetings everyone, I'm Feldon Azrik. I apologize that we had to pull you from your duties aboard the *Dark Stallion*, but your small unit has been given a particularly unique mission. It has the potential to be very dangerous to you and a lot of other people. We are only operating on leads and my belief in the Force. I would definitely like to answer any questions you might have while we await the droid to be secured."
*The only thing the squad knows is where they are going, they know nothing about their new squad leader or the details of their mission.

Dor looks up from analyzing the hyperdrive, looking at Vor'en. "Ummm, sir. I'm not sure this can be fixed."
Forlornly, Dor ventures,"This droid apparently set this up as a kill switch. If we switch off the hyperdrive or try to remove the power regulator, it will fail. Eventually, it will fail if we do nothing. Any of these failures will over stress the ship and kill us all."
Contemplatively, Dor muses,"Maybe it doesn't need to be fixed. I wonder if I can reroute power into a new power regulator and into the inertial dampner. Where is the spare parts bin?"

"Look in the cargo hold do what ever you need to get this fixed." Vor'en picks up his commlink. "Sir we are going to be awhile getting the hyperdrive fixed it has been sabutaged to give out killing us all when we drop out of hyperspace." Vor'en looks at Dor hopeing the kid can do what he claims he can. "Dor thinks he can bypass the problem and we should be able to jump out of hyperspace when we need to." "I can still use a hand getting the driod secured."

Lost in thought, Dor asks,"Can someone find out how much time I have until we are supposed to come out of hyperspace? I'd hate to find a 10 hour fix with only 5 hours to implement. For that matter, I wonder how long it will take before the inertial dampners fail. Perhaps I'd better that out before haring off."
Looking up to Vor'en, Dor requests,"Sir, could you find me someone to help me. I think mostly I just need a go-getter and tool hander. I'd rather someone else go for the spare power regulator just now."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-02 03:08:02)

Dorijidan carefully looks over the faulty hyperdrive. It seems the power regulator has been tampered with and it would be best to just get a new one. The regulator was still working, but not as it should be. If he had a new regulator he could reroute power and then the inertial dampers would be fine. He estimates it would take about two hours total to do this work, and he would likely miss the mission briefing. It would take one hour to install a new regulator, and another to properly reroute power. The ship would have to come out of hyperspace though.
Feldon looks at everyone in the main hold.

The young man comes froward to speak, he's not dressed in a traditional Republic uniform it looks more like a combat mercenary uniform fashioning no ranks or medals. His shoulder length brown hair is tied back using braids on the left and right side , and his bright blue eyes stand out. His uniform is weathered, and a noticeable out of place mustard yellow scarf stained of blood, dirt and sweat is tucked under his coat. A breath mask dangles from is neck, and a pair of goggles rest on top his head. The only noticeable weapons seem archaic. A knife strapped to the bottom of his right leg, a slug thrower pistol on his hip and the barrel of a sporting rifle that his all temperate cloak cannot hide on his back.
Hadru speaks out to Feldon, "We all have been brought out here to do something, and it would be nice to be briefed on what exactly you are asking us to do. In my experience preparation and planning for the right task can save lives and make things easier. I know you have a plan, and I would like to hear it. It would also be nice know every ones skills so that we are familiarized with each other in case we need to delegate."
The last question was more directed to the other soldiers than to Feldon.

Feldon: "Well as you know Hadru; Jes Mur Eva, has been missing from the Jedi Order for months. Lues Van *(formerly Rith Bendar)*, has felt a disturbance in the Force. He believes Mur Eva has encountered something drastic on Vjun. This is the best news we have had in a while as to her whereabouts. Now, I understand that it's not the New Republic Army's jurisdiction to find missing jedi, but Lues believes Mur Eva has found something that could threaten the safety of the galaxy. Although his premonition is vague, he thinks that she is definitely on Vjun and enountering something very dangerous. Since the information we have about this danger is vague, we were only granted one squad of military support to handle this. However, this mission has a top secret rating. No one here is allowed to shared with anyone what occurs on this operation. I'm not trying to be deceitful in any way, but too much is at risk here and we'd like to keep with us. Lues could probably tell you a bit more about it when we get the detailed briefing. Basically though, it's a rescue and reconnaissance mission to Vjun that has enormous potential danger. Lues has had problems recovering his memory, but lately his feelings hasn't been leading us in the right direction. I wouldn't be surprised if this a false alarm, but be ready for anything. Any other questions about the mission? We should get the complete briefing in one hour."

I wonder who would try to sabotage this ship or why? Has this mission been found out, not likely. There seems to be so conflict already on board.

Awne had been watching the new comers as they spoke or listened; needless to say she was glaring at the human with the rifle by the one she's deemed 'star-boy.' His entire aura was, to her, giving off a sense of no respect, so it really wasn't any wonder when she started to growl at him.

## Re: Starshade

### **master_Tru** (2008-09-02 13:54:27)

Lance senses the aggression, no protective nature from the Awne long before the low growl. Interesting this one in some ways similar to himself but at the same time so different. Lance pats his fellow "soldier" on the shoulder. "It is prudent to be on guard but I currently sense no danger, if it would set you at ease I would search the ship again with you." Lance says to Theos as he glances at Awne with the last part of his statement.

Awne blinks, tilting her head slightly as she stops her growling; that one was odd..but atleast he was taking matters under control. Hopefully his guard would show respect to her master now; she gives the man a small nod of thanks, and though she wasn't sure if the last had been directed to her she glances to the doorway and back before standing; bowing to her master and moving out the door again to look around.

"You need a hand kid let me know I am not going anywhere until you are finished." "I will order the ship to normal space and then you can start your work." Pulling out his commlink Vor'en calls Hardu. " Take out of hyperspace son so we can get this fixed."

Feldon stops his pacing a moment to respond to the soldier.
Feldon: "That's a good question given the circumstances. I believe it is highly unlikely that anybody other than us would know about this mission. If they did, then our cover has already been partially lost. Furthermore, your squad doesn't even know the details of the mission, so how could have it gotten around? Before today the Jedi I travel with were the only ones who knew what was going on taking this mission. We don't even know who the enemy is, as we just have sensed Mur Eva is in grave danger on Vjun. Our most prominent enemies lately have been the corrupt Falsoor branch and Bordo the hutt, so it's definitely a factor we will consider in the planning phase. Before anyone gets any rest double-check the ship again, although we searched everywhere. What do you think soldier?"

Though you did state we have no idea who our adversary is or are. That being said it is possible the enemy has resources within our own ranks."

I don't think we'll know what's going on unless a threat is persistent against us. Sorry, I didn't want to insinuate that someone amongst could be an enemy.

Dorijidan lays his tool kit out beside him, carefully picking out the items he'd need for the task. He then places a glow rod over the area in the hyperdrive where the power regulator resided. It seemed that it had been bashed and soldered a bit. Although it was not destroyed, he chose to uninstall it and put in a new regulator since they had a spare anyways. The inertial damper would be fine after he rewired the power a bit and inserted the new regulator. This work would take him about two hours; although it would beneficial if he had assistance. *Your check will come after the end of two hours.* 
Hadru sits in the cockpit as the *Starshade* just came out of the hyperspace worm hole. All he could see in the viewport was the pinhole effect of stars scattered across a vast black space. There was nothing in visual range of tiny starlights.

A blue luminescent image is projected from the small device. The image is of a young woman with a very spacer-like look to her. She has very short hair that has been styled and spiked with a band across her forehead. The human female had a button nose and was attractive for a rough looking type. She was wearing a vest and striped-pants with a thigh-holster and a blaster was in it. Woroken and Awne immediately notice her as Ordenn Rann, a person they encountered years ago on a Tatooine settlement named Mos Esre. She had struck a deal with the Remnant in the area and attempted to hand Red Team over, a vicious fight ensued and Ordenn was killed in the crossfire. This is how they came under possession of Ordenn's ship the *Starshade*.
Ordenn: "Hiya B1-E. If you're viewing this, you know this is your final order from your master. You've no doubt been recently reactivated. I'm sorry I had to deactivate you for this long, but I had to use you as a fail safe in case Bordo finally decided to come after this ship. It possesses sensitive information and it is my baby. I won't allow anyone to take those things. You remember my kouhun *Knowledge:Life Sciences* farm? You turning this projector on triggered their release; that was phase 1 of my last order. The last part of my final order is to take out the engines, but be careful when messing with the hyperdrive because it is twitchy with the energy binders."

Most seem real devoted to the New Republic, but there are a couple that seem real mercenary to me.
I doubt they'd sell us out unless it could be a sure bet, but I'd not rely on them to
watch my back. As for their service records, they all seem to have been selected
as real hard cases. It's almost as if this mission expects to encounter significant
opposition."

Without taking his eyes off of the creature Theos starts out once again to look over the ship once again. Silent as ever Theos walks from room to room with Lance watching his back and the purring cat thing in tow. The feeling of annoyance of the cat thing tagging along is noticed by Lance but ever so slightly in Theos movements. After finding the holoprojector Theos nods to Lance and tosses it to him with out a second thought about it and resumes position to continue the search. He also motions to Lance letting him know that they are no longer in hyperspace through hand jestures taught in their commando training. As the wookiee speaks asking the question about hyperspace Theos turns his head and nods at him.
For some reason Theos feels at ease around the walking carpet. Having fought a few battles with the wookiees and against Theos knows what the creature is capable of and respects him for it.

Seeing Vor'en concern, Dor says, "Well, the install is pretty straight forward.
It's getting power regulator calibrated to work just right with the inertial dampers.
If there are power fluctuations, things go badly when entering and exiting hyperspace.
There can also be troubles when trying to perform accessive accelerations.
I've seen a number of these power regulators blow on the Katarn shuttles we
used for hot LZ insertions."
Thinking ahead, Dor comments, "Anyway, I could use your help checking flux relay readings
once we get to splicing this new power regulator into the power array. The install is the easy part."
Adjusting to the new subject, Dor speaks gently,"I've been meaning to ask how command came up with squad assignments.
While I've had some automatic weapon training, it not where my experience lies.
The raids we were doing required close controlled fire support, not long range suppressive fire.
We were often trying to minimize damage to civilian infrastructure. Maybe command thinks we're going to
need that kind of heavy firepower. In that case, your ideas about a blue milk run become a forlorn hope.

"Good news, weÂ´re about to learn what the heck we are doing here"
He spots the holoprojector, and watches its message being played.
"Okay...does that mean what I think it means?"

Lance finds that the cargo bay next to the main corridor is empty of all people. He meditates and is able to sense no danger upcoming. Despite all evidence that had been discovered about attacks, the Force led him to believe otherwise.

A little disturbed by that Lance was unable to sense danger of any kind Lance reaches out through the force to Master Feldon. "Master Feldon I have meditated on the current situation. Unfortunately I have been unable to discover anything; it could be my novice skill or perhaps I am being blocked somehow. Could you provide any insight to this Master Feldon?"

We where getting ready to get started on the job catching animals for some lab when all hell breaks lose. Reminet shows up and start shotting the heck out of the ship we where on and of course we had to crash land the thing. We where picked up by the New Republic and we agreed to work for them and we where also contacted by the Master Feldon and his students or what ever they call them and we found this guy for them and after the battle that always happens we ecaped on this beauthifull ship and the rest is either classified or histroy I would rather leave in the past."

of the New Republic military for 6 years now. I was still in training when the Imperial Remnant
surrendered. So I transferred to the Nexu commando squad so I could still be useful.
Ended up in a few scrapes, but our team always made it out. The Hanis pirates had our number.
We lost 4 squad mates on the Gundark's Maw. I got lucky. I ended up on the side of the ship that had the escape pods.
After that Retay and I couldn't be a unit even with new recruits. Too much got lost on the Gundark's Maw.
Command agreed to transfer us. Since I was between units, command threw me in with this bunch.
We've only been a squad for a month and we really haven't seen action as a unit yet."

Awne frowns at the image of the woman "I rrememberr herr...tough gamblerr type, I only saw herr a few times. Though she did turrn us in to the Rremnant..gone now though. Sorrrry..don't know that much about herr." It wasn't long after her explination that others came and went into the hall until the mercenary turned padawan found herself alone in the hallway. Sighing and shaking her head she turns to make her way back to the helm and see how things were doing.
Once reaching the room she smiles to Hadru, messing up his hair with a chuckle "how arre things up herre?" She'd grown quite fond of the little guy when they first met and had taken to watching over him like, as Woro would say, a mother cat. Whether that was true or not was something she wasn't quite sure of and frankly didn't care.

Theos carefully searches through the indentation on the wall. The way it is shaped, seemed to be a small bug farm of some sort. He looks through the dirt and can find nothing suspicious. The dirt on the ground mostly seemed to have fell through the metallic grating. The dirt that was still on the grating had nothing in it either.

"Hello there, Theros, I believe it is," the wookiee said holding his furry paw in front of him, and went to shake the human's hand.

Awne explains to Hadru that this bug farm was likely to be home of Ordenn's kouhuns according to the holoprojector. Hadru reasons with Awne by using his expert knowledge. He describes that they were arthopods from the world of Induomondo. They are so small and poisonous that they are often employed by assassins for stealth murders. They were aggressive creatures and could detect an enemy by warmth. They possessed different types of poison that were lethal or non-lethal. Hadru estimates that since the dirt has just been freshly spilled, they would of already been attacked by starved kouhuns. It's a safe bet in Hadru's mind that the kouhuns are all dead because they have been in the ship for years without anyone tending to them. Therefore, he believes the threat from the kouhuns is nonexistent.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-03 21:16:20)

Vor'en and Dorijidan hear the announcement as they are working on the hyperdrive. Vor'en estimates since they were doing so well and making good time that they could go ahead and sit through the briefing. They walk into the main hold after they put away their tools. Everyone else on the *Starshade* filters into the main hold for the briefing.
After a few minutes of idle chatter,a Jedi that nobody in the squad had seen before walked into the room. He was wearing nothing but a black tunic with brown shoulder sashes. He had black gloves, dark-brown pants, and glossy black boots. His hair was long and blondish/white. He seemed to have a scar on the right part of his face that looked as if it cut into his eye a bit. That eye next to the scar seemed to be bloodshot. He had a very serious demeanor for his young face. The Jedi's robes were not on so you figured he took them off for the planning. And typical of the other Jedi, he had a lightsaber clipped to his belt.
Red Team knew this young man as Rith Bendar at one time, until he was able to recover from a mysterious amnesia case at a backwater Falsoor building on Nar Shaddaa. Rith Bendar discovered from the Falsoor archives that he was once known as Jedi Knight Lues Van. This jarred his memory and he retook the role as Jedi, constructing a new lightsaber. He was able to rejoin the Jedi Order after he had been pronounced missing in action years ago. Lues had been working with Red Team for some time now, doing their part for the Order and trying to uncover the corruption of Falsoor. At this point, all that was really known about Falsoor is that they had been stockpiling illegal weaponry. But Lues believes the complete truth of Falsoor is lingering in his mind, he just can't remember yet. Unfortunately, they weren't able to get proof against Falsoor so the New Republic couldn't do anything about it yet.
Lues politely bows to the people congregating in the main hold. While he is doing this, Master Lorhas walks in with a smile on his face.
Lues: "Greetings, I'm Jedi Knight Lues Van. I'm looking forward to working with the NRDF army and getting to know you. Lt. Baruush will be here shortly."

Awne nods her head to Hadur in understanding, thankful that no bugs were going to get into her fur, the thought making her fur shudder. She looks down the corrider and back again to the boy of sorts, true not a boy any more but still always a boy to her. She smiles at him, nudging him to get his attention "Come on cub" she grins at him "we can set the ship to auto forr a while so we can hearr the brrriefing." She ruffles his hair again after pointing to the controls to have him set it up then moves down the corrider and into the main hold.
Her tail paused in movement at the sight of Rith *no..no Lues now, Rrith's gone* she reminds herself, tearing her eyes away and moving to a seat, crossing a leg over the other, her tail curling around her ankle while her hands are placed neatly in her lap; blue eyes trying very hard to not look over to the human she had fell for, at least..it seemed that part of him was gone.

Vor'en spots the Mon Calamari lieutenant stride into the main hold. Remembering back to the cutthroat Empire and what happens when you don't render respect to officers; he wisely shouts , "Attention on deck!" The room jumps to life at this disciplined statement, some people didn't seem to think Vor'en had it in him. *You can state your character does not render respect, if you say nothing I'll assume the squad does so. The Jedi don't really matter.* Lt. Baaruush was clad in a one-piece, gray New Republic uniform. She wore a black belt with a blaster at her hip. She was not wearing footwear, as that would impede movement for her leg-fins. On the left side of her chest was the rank insignia of Lieutenant. Although the uniform seemed more comfortable on a human, it had been accommodated for the Mon Calamari's amphibian-like traits. She had salmon-colored skin; which was mottled with light and dark patterns. She had webbed hands, a domed head, and bulbous eyes. The three Jedi stood next to her, facing the assembly, as she prepared to speak. The officer looks over to the Jedi and nods; she crosses her hands in front of her, assuming a parade-like stance.
Lt. Baruush: "Everyone take your seats. I'm 1st Lieutenant Callie Baruush. My squad already knows me; for those who don't know me I welcome you. Staff Sergeant Vor'en, I'm honored to have you as my squad leader. I can't wait to see what you can do. I'll admit that it will be a pleasure to work with our Force-friendly Jedi. However, it's unfortunate we have to work under these circumstances. I've been keeping you all waiting, so without further ado, let's get started. We have a lot to cover, if you have any questions, please interject anytime during the briefing."

The Mon Calamari takes a sip from her drink and then begins talking.
Lt. Baruush: Firstly, lets go over the units will be functioning in and their roles. I will be in charge of communications and command relay. Throughout the operation, I will be posted in the *Starshade*. It will also be my job to give primary air support if the situation arises. That is, if Captain Vor'en doesn't mind me using his ship? Now, due to the fact that we could be dealing with something that is very dangerous, and that this could also be a lead to Falsoor - the NRDF has complete jurisdiction over this operation. The Jedi are not trusted these days and the NRDF is the only one who can actively act on "hunches" without nearly as much political repercussions. We were able to convince higher that their is a chance that at least Falsoor has stockpiled illegal weapons, thus making it concern of the military, not Jedi. With this being said, Staff Sergeant Vor'en and his squad are the primary effort on the ground. Even though this mission is top secret, it is still going on record. It must be expressed that the NRDF handled it.
Lt. Baruush squares her shoulders toward Vor'en.
Baruush: This means you have complete command over everyone on the assignment Staff Sergeant. Your men are going to look forward to you to make the right decisions, don't let us down. If Vor'en should go down, remember the chain of command. Team leader 1 takes over, then 2...etc. The mission main effort is Vor'en's squad, with the Jedi as support, and me as air support/command. Any questions at this point?

He had seen jedi fight before, and he thought it to be a waste of skill not to have them on the front lines. But he kept his quiet, not wanting to cause unnecessary disruption.
At the mention of questions, he cleared his throat.
"Just one, sir. When will we begin?"

Lt. Baruush smiles at Gor's question.
Lt. Baruush: "Come now? Do you really think I wouldn't tell you when we were going to execute the mission? As it stands now we are looking to start in one day, if we can get the hyperdrive fixed in time."
The Mon Calamari watches Gor sit, then responds to Vor'en's question.
Baruush: "That's a good question. All we know about Falsoor at the moment is that they may have had some illegal dealings with weapons. Therefore, leave the weapons, but get evidence of Falsoor personnel handling the illegal weapons. They are not allowed to possess military grade equipment either. You either must get photographic evidence or electronic data of anything Falsoor does that is corrupt before we can formally incriminate them. Vor'en you will be issued a portable computer and a holoprojector to handle these tasks. If you have any questions about Falsoor's legality be sure to contact me. If you have any doubts contact me."
Baruush awaits Vor'en to take his place, then listens to Theos's by-the-book formality of a question. The lieutenant laughs amusingly at Theos.
Baruush: "You're not in basic training anymore private, I just need one Ma'am. Rules of engagement for this mission are to attack ONLY if you feel threatened by life or limb. We are not permitted to intervene in any 3rd party engagements. If you see two groups fighting, and you're not threatened - stay out of it, it is not your mission. We can't afford the casualties
for these kind of skirmishes and we don't want to anger any locals if we can avoid it. This is another reason NRDF takes jurisdiction. You will NOT get into any affairs that don't directly relate to this mission. To further elaborate on the ROE's, mission-sensitive equipment cannot be protected by lethal or non-lethal force. Thus, if you lose your computer to someone Vor'en, it's lost unless you can convince the person to give it back. This doesn't mean if a kid grabs your light repeating blaster and opens up, that you just ask him to trade for some candy. I'll get into the details of the mission being top secret later in the segment. I'll also address the objectives soon. Right now we are addressing the orientation of this briefing. That is, who we will be working with and designated enemies."
The Lt looks at the Jedi standing next to her for a minute, then continues on. Also it is noticed that Lues takes a minute to look at Awne, and smiles. He then resumes a more stoic stance.
Baruush: "We don't have any intelligence on actual enemies you may be facing. But the Jedi reported that Falsoor does have various fringe security members, and they are known to possess combat droids. Keep in mind, that we don't know if you'll even run into Falsoor on Vjun, it's just a theory given to us by Lues Van. Any other enemies could just be indigenous inhabitants, or no one at all. Let's hope that its just a clean rescue and recon. Ok, so the mission lineup as personnel goes like this: Myself with command/communication support, NRDF squad as primary effort, then Jedi as support. Any more questions on the orientation segment of the briefing?"

Despite all her effort to not look at the jedi, it seemed it was failing, but atleast she caught the smile sent her way; which, though her posture didn't change, her expression did to one of warmth as she smiles back to him, it didn't matter to ger that his attention returned to what it was, he smiled at her, that's what was important to her..that at least it seemed he still cared for her.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-05 18:57:01)

Lt. Baruush nods to the group.
Baruush: "If there are no more questions, I will turn the briefing over to Lues Van. Lues has been our primary intelligence source for this mission, as we have no concrete evidence to operate on."
The young Jedi steps forward as the Mon Calamari steps back. He gestures toward the group and begins speaking.
Lues: "Good afternoon soldiers and Jedi. We've heard who will be dealing with, and now we'll discuss the situation of this mission - and how it came to be. The mission centers around a female Jedi Knight called Jes Mur Eva. She is a good person and a skilled Jedi, albeit a little hot-headed at times. But, she has no doubt been undergoing some trying times as of late, and I feel it is my responsibility to get to the bottom of this. As some of you know I've had a problem with a devastating amnesia case from which I'm still recovering from. A few months ago, I was able to recover some of my memory. Me and Mur Eva were discussing families, and she was really wondering about hers - because she had no memory of a family. Strangely, I was able to recover some memory that was a shock to me and everyone else. Part of the reason I was able to recall my memory is because we had recently been investigating Falsoor and that I had a past with them. This fact, coupled with Mur Eva's persistent inquiries - led me to remember that I did know of her past. Although I wasn't able to recall HOW I knew of her past, I suddenly remembered that I did know her family history. The thing that I remembered was, is that she was created by Falsoor research. Regrettably, I shouldn't have told her this, but I felt it was necessary because one should know their past."
Lues: "After she discovered this information, she left from the Jedi Order. We have been searching for quite some time. However, we are doing so with no leads and nothing to go on. Just recently I was able to feel her presence in the Force. She was in great pain, and was dealing with something immensely evil. Well, what does this have to do with Falsoor you may be wondering? I believe that she likely discovered the truth of her origins, and only Falsoor is capable of such evil to artificially create a life form. The nature of this vision I've had leads me to believe Mur Eva has discovered the truth about Falsoor. However, I'm not really considered a credible source of intelligence. As some of you may know, the Jedi have a hard time being trusted since the Galactic Civil War. A hunch based on the Force does not travel well. Only the Republic military has the legal power to make an action towards Falsoor. We have enough evidence to take action because of our prior investigations on Falsoor. We discovered they were stockpiling illegal weaponry. This is enough to grant us power of search in case we do find anything more corrupt about Falsoor, including Mur Eva's creation. We are here to support you on your reconnaisance and rescue, but if certain evidence is discovered, we will assume full command of this mission. But as it stands, the NRDF is the only one authorized to have complete authority."
Lues takes a moment to catch his breath, and looks over the reaction of the Jedi and soldiers.
Lues: "In case you didn't know, Falsoor is an independent science organization who specializes in life science research and restoration of destroyed ecosystems. The fact that they have been so successful in assistance of clean up after the Galactic Civil War and the Remnant's exploits makes it harder for us to incriminate them. Although I can't remember my past with Falsoor, I believe Mur Eva has discovered something crucial. All this information, is the reason why this mission has down on you. We're operating on little evidence and I have a strong foreboding we're about to encounter something devastating. That's why the mission must remain low profile, we can't make an incident out of this. Everything that occurs must be kept secret, and if the situation is very bad, we have a chance to suppress it before it gets out of control."
Lues looks to the group, with a look that says someone will be curious now.
Lues Van: "Do I have any questions about the situation?"

While thinking about the possibilities of the description of Jedi "support," he glances across the room and notices Lues and Awne exchange a slightly uncomfortable glance before the Jedi began to speak. He supposed things would always be uncomfortable between them, given their history.
"Master Lues, have you been able to pinpoint an approximate location for Mur Eva, or did you sense her generally? I would volunteer to go to her aid immediately if we have a location."

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-09-05 20:15:00)

Awne frowned at the new information, Mur Eva is the reason behind all this? If she was in pain at all, the farghul would join anything to get her back, granted the two had not had the best start; but it hadn't taken long until Awne had formed a somewhat respect for the other woman in her pack, after all she was a good fighter and..though she'd hate to admit it aloud they did seem to have similier temperments.
Still, Awne's tail would tighten slight around the 'cub's' ankle then relax; mur eva would be found and helped, for that she was sure.

Theos: "Ma'am is it in the squads secondary objective to locate the missing jedi after the information as been obtained or are we only there to secure said information and return it with the up most haste? If finding the missing jedi isn't part of our mission is the squad to wait for the jedi if they so choose to look for their missing companion? Theos speaks and a bit of his mandalorian accent edges into some of his words. As he speask no emotion is put into his wording as he is only attempting to find out more information about contingency's plans should they arise during the mission.
After the mon cal is finshed speaking Thoes leans back against the wall. Stern look on his face as always.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-05 21:11:47)

Lues watches Theos as he asks his question. He looks over to Lt. Baruush and nods. The officer steps back up in front of the small assembly.
Lt. Baruush: "Private, that brings us to the next segment of the briefing, the mission. Your primary objectives are as follows: 1. You are to search out and discover the condition of Jedi Knight, Jes Mur Eva. If she is in a helpless condition and appears to need help, you are to assist. You are to rescue her if she is held captive anywhere. You are to assist to get her out of danger, if any.
2. Conduct a reconnaissance patrol on the surface of Vjun to determine any Falsoor presence.You are also to determine if there is any other force that could be a threat to galactic security or the Republic. If Falsoor is discovered, you are to find out what they are doing there and why. These are your primary objectives. It would be helpful if you rescue Mur Eva first, but you can accomplish these objectives in any order. Your secondary objective will be to gather any information of Falsoor's corruption. You must take evidence of Falsoor personnel handling illegal weaponry. Also, take evidence of any other corrupted item,data, or person. If at any point during the mission you feel you cannot accomplish the objectives, arrange for extraction. The mission is to last no longer than two days of landing on Vjun. If you go past that timeline, we will have to return to the *Dark Stallion* immediately. Remember, disavow all knowledge of this mission to everyone outside of this room. You should never talk about it after the mission is over. Is everyone clear on the mission objectives? Once again, the primaries can be done in any order. You do the secondary objective if the situation presents itself and you have time. Rules of engagement are do not attack unless threatened by life or limb. If you attack, shoot to kill. Equipment is not guarded by lethal or non-lethal force. Do not engage anyone unless they are a direct threat. Any questions on the mission?"

Vor'en looks at the man he used to know as Rith. " Lues you know I will back you on this, you risk any member of my squad or friends on a "Hunch" I will become real unfriendly." Vor'en puffs on his cigar. Lues should know that this is no idle threat, Vor'en will back it up. "I got no problem going in to get the girl out. No one deserves to have there life messed with." Vor'en will probably get a reaction out of the Lt. on his statement, but it didn't matter there lives where more important then to be wasted on a hunch.

As Theos hears that we are actually going to resuce a force user can't seem to hide a disgusted look on his face as it only appears for a moment.
Thoes: *Talking quitely to himself* Just went from extracting information to a search party looking for a lost jedi and while were at it can you look around for informaion."
Thoes: *Listens to the Sarge puff on that cigar and talk* Sarge isn't this whole mission on their hunch? Theos is asking in a respectful tone as the Sarge shows signs of a warrior not a pampered jedi or officer.
Theos picks up his rig and starts to get his gear in order checking to make sure everything is loaded, strapped on tightly and secure. After he's done he double checks himself.

Lues: "My name isn't Rith, Vor'en. You know I have changed a great deal after I regained some of my memory. Take a seat please Staff Sergeant. We'll talk about this after the briefing."
The Jedi and the officer seemed a little stunned after the statement. They await for the briefing to return to order.

Awne raised a brow at Vor'en, she found it amusing his reaction and threat. She couldn't help the small grin on her lips as she looks between the jedi that was once her rith and her dear friend, chuckling softly to herself at the goings on before speaking up.
"Come on now Vorr'en, it's been a long time since we've had to do anything rreally dangerrous, enjoy it while it lasts. We'll all be alrright, we all know the rrisks and we'rre still doing this...besides...I think those cigarrs will kill you fasterr than any mission." She gives him a wink and a grin.

Woro considers Baruush's words-there would be definitely no forcing Mur Eva to do anything she did not want to do, either with strength or with words. Woroken still remembered seeing her slice and dice the group of Tusken Raiders after their crash on Tatooine. He was quite sure she could handle herself in just about any situation.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-05 23:14:44)

Lt. Baruush takes a sip from her cup, and continues speaking.
Baruush: "If we have nothing else, let's continue. We're going to execute the mission as follows: In one day we will arrive on planet Vjun. The marine squad, led by Sgt Vor'en, will conduct a standard patrol to the primary objectives. If the squad is able to continue and accomplish their objectives, they may call for extraction when they deem neccessary. You'll have two total days to complete the mission. You are not allowed to go past that. We will extract on the 3rd day if the limit has been reached. You'll be given one field kit to be carried by one of the members of the squad. Vor'en will be issued one holoprojector and portable computer. Second team leader will carry a long-range comlink (backpack). Finally, you'll each carry sevens rations and water to last for three days. Obviously, more supplies are on the ship if you run into trouble. Other than that, we are on a long range recon people. If we get stranded, we can't expect rescue for a week. We do not have a HoloNet transceiver issued to us. We only have a subspace transceiver . That's the severity of this mission. Primary communication between us will be comlink and subspace transceiver. Secondary will be personal comlinks. I expect a comms check every thirty minutes, or I will be in the air looking for you. If you lose communication, return to the *Starshade.* If you get lost, return to the last known position where you were all together. Go to the *Starshade* if at possible. That will be all, mission proceeds as soon as we land on the surface. You all have your duties. I recommend you talk to the Jedi about the situation if you get a chance. Any questions over anything I've covered?"

In the long run would it not be wise to set up two or three extraction points incase the group has to split up during the mission. It's a wise move having more then one extraction just in case one extraction point is hot we can hike it to another that is in the clear."

Hadru shared a few of the ideas that the others expressed. He nods when agreeably to Theos and Dor's questions as he feels they are both prudent. The comments and conversation keep Hadru's eyes moving as he listens to briefing. Dor's comment about Mur Eva possibly not wanting to leave was also at the back of his own mind. It seemed that these soldiers were sharp and Hadru liked that he was working with professionals that were like minded.
'We are going to need more resources, explosives, recon equipment, and credits. Information doesn't come easy unless we are not on a time frame. Infiltration and information extraction can take weeks even longer if we are doing espionage missions. It doesn't sound like we have that kind of time. We are going to need credits for bribes, and equipment that we may need to buy while on the planet. Transportation, vehicles and I don't know anything about this planet we are visiting. What can you tell me about inhabitants, ecology, exports, imports, technology... its best do know what were dealing with before we jump in with with our two feet.'
You can tell right away Hadru is all about preparation, and he seems to deem it highly necessary to be prepared.

Dor speaks up again. "I understand we are to extract her if she wishes to come. Obviously, we are to prevent Falsoor personnel from retaining her. What about Vjun local security? Is there a police force for Vjun? Do we extract against local security's wishes?"
Dor pauses a moment, as if weighing a thought. "Something else has been bothering me. You assembled a strike team. You did not assemble an infiltration team. You did not acquire a couple members of the Diplomatic Corps. What intelligence were you aware of when you decided a strike team was needed?"

Lt Baaruush: "The only intelligence we have about Vjun is that it is a barren world. There is no longer a stable government in place and most of the population has gone insane due to experiments by a wealthy family there. No one lives there but human beings. Essentially, with the group I've assembled; Jedi and Soldiers, you can do all three of those functions. Infiltration, diplomacy, and offensive; We cannot draw help from those people you listed, as our mission is to be as low profile as possible. The Jedi asked for help and this is all the Republic would give them. Due to the odds the planet is barren and we cannot get anyone else, this team is the best we could afford. The best information I could tell you is to call me in any case not covered by instructions. Any more questions?"

Vor'en could see the specialized gear sitting on the cargo bins. There was a long-range commlink pack, portable computer, field kit, extra rations, water, and holoprojector.
The rations and water would fit on a person.

Theos picks up his gear and moves towards the Sarge waiting to see if this human had anything to say. Theos has a soft spot ofr anyone who thinks jedi need to be put in their place and has the guts to tell them so.
Thoes: "Anything other information you need to let us in on sarge before we undergo this mission?"

"Ok, Lance you get the comm gear check it over and make sure it is working properly." Vor'en pulls out the gear and sets it out. "Computer and Holo cam are mine I guess, Someone take the field kit. The rest of you grab your packs and the rest of the supplys. Weapons check will be before we hit planet. Let's get it together people. Lance pick your back up, we will operate in two man teams one lead other getts the repeating blaster. I want all gear ready to go in four hours. Aftere that get some rest." Vor'en takes out the computer and holo cam checks them over quickly and stows them where he will find them. His weapons are allready ready he trys to keeps them ready at all times.
He looks at Theos. "I know about as much as you do. I think I have met once or twice before maybe when we where on Tatoonie." Vor'en goes over his gear getting stowed and ready for use. Looking over his carbine he seems to reguard it with a sigh. "I wish I was bringing the E-11 with me on this, but they want me to use there gear so." "Do me a favor kid after your done with your gear check over my weapon for me and get it ready." "Dor your with me let's get the ship fixed and moving again." Vor'en finishes up with his gear and heads for the engine room.

As Vor'en heads to the engine room to finish his work he desides to stop by his cabin and grab his E-11 and take it with him. He can stow it in his pack and then use it on the mission. He didn't have a problem with the weapon issued to him, he just likes things that are frimilar to him.

You know, we discovered Woroken and Awne much the same way we are doing with your group. It's amazing, but it seems the Force has gathered around us immensely throughout the years. You have not gotten past the notice of Master Lorhas as well."

Seeing all the specialzed gear vanish before him, Gor started to head back towards his quarters to oversee his own gear. He checked and tested all of his guns, including the new ones that had been assigned him on this mission. The he strapped his full gear back on him: Guns on the hips and back, utility belt in place, and bandolier across his chest filled with various goods of combat. He took a look at the rifle he had been given, really a little too heavy for his taste, and decided to bring it along just in case the firepower was needed.
He slung it over his shoulder, and then set out to find his teammate, the other bothan. Knowing him to be with the sergeant in engineering, he headed that way.

Lance looks around to the faces of the crew as they check their duty`s as well. "Its just that I really don`t know how I fit in here or even why I was chosen to a special forces unit. I suppose the force has a way with the universe, sometimes its just not obvious."

Vor'en enters the engine room after making sure everyone has there gear. He would be dealing with his squad split into teams. Lance would head one of these but with carrying the comm gear he would have to be kept close to him at all times.
Thinking over this he missed the armor that he was alll to farmilar with it was like second skin to him. I battle he missed it, a H.U.D is a beautifull thing in a fire fight. He dissmissed these thoughts. That was another time and he would not see that armor for awhile. Not that he didn't have armor, he had a set of Stromtrooper armor stowed on the ship. The NR wouldn't like it if he used it on missions.

Feldon: "The Force does have a way with the universe; It is everything and every aspect of life you could possibly believe. If you want to know how you fit in, try listening to the Force more and your own mind less. As Jedi, you learn not to be so selfish as to let your own thoughts guide the way, though they are important. The Force is more powerful than a single mind, so let it influence yours - and you'll see your truth path in life."

Lance finishes his com link checks as he listens to Feldon "You have given me much to think about, much of this is still new to me. It was never my dream to cruse across the galaxy trying to be a hero." Thinking back to his training Lance remembers a similar speech made by another master just before he was told that they had no master for him and that he would be reassigned to a special forces unit. "Perhaps the other jedi will make an example for me as I watch their progress. Maybe I could even call upon you in the future for more advise, if that would be ok with you?"

"Personally I think all such things are just in the way. Harder to sneak around in that"
He looks around the engineering bay, apparently seeking for someone. Then he gives VorÂ´en a smile.
"And I know we might look alike to you humans, but as the squad leader, you would probably do well to keep track of who is who of your bothans. Dor will probably be around to help you shortly.

Theos: "Ya know the force isn't all powerful as people assume. Many jedi have fallen in many battles do them relying solely on the force to aid them in everyway. Its why I choose my weapons to be ones that are visable."

Feldon responds to Lance's statement.
Feldon: " I want you to definitely seek me out whenever you have a question. Be wary though, I'm not allowed to formally train you - that is for safety precautions. I'm sure you can understand? But I'd be happy to assist within reason."
The Jedi Knight watches Theos as he remarks about the Force.
Feldon: "I'd be inclined to disagree with you Theos, although you make a good point. Jedi have fallen in battle by relying too heavily on the Force. However, the Force is all-powerful, but we are all limited to its power by our minds. We can only let the Force do so much for us."
Meanwhile, in engineering, the veteran sergeant and the bothan mechanic work steadily on the hyperdrive. Dorijidan tinkers with the faulty regulator for a half-hour, and then requires Vor'en's help to uninstall it correctly. The regulator is replaced with a brand new one, and they spend the next hour and a half rearranging the power flow. They correct the power and make sure it is tandem with the inertial dampers. Vor'en runs a few diagnostic tests on the hyperdrive via the engine status screen. After all the tests come back positive, Dorijidan seals shut the durasteel siding on the hyperdrive. He flips a switch and the hyperdrive core lights up with a brilliant blue luminescent glow. The sound of the thrumming energy is comforting in all of its ambient audio display. Vor'en and Dorijidan look at each other with a face of success.

Vor'en climbs into the two-seater cockpit, despite the cramped space and he settles in. He begins punching in commands to the hypertransceiver. He sits back in the padded chair and relaxes a minute, awaiting for the coordinates from the navicomputer. The soldier stares at the black void of space, blanketed by hundreds of little dots. A soft beeping can be heard coming from the navicomputer. He observes the route to Vjun on screen, it seemed the coordinates looked good. Vor'en clenched his fist firmly on the hyperdrive acceleration stick and pulled back steadily. The engines hummed to full power with an omniscient whirring. The stars in space turned into starlines, and the ship thrusted forward faster than a blink of an eye. They were now in hyperspace, and the navicomputer estimated they would arrive at Vjun in no more than a day.

I intend no disrespect toward the Lt. I'm not used to having so little intelligence. Given that we only have 2 days, getting intelligence will very difficult. This planet is lawless.

Hadru was in the cockpit "piloting" before Voren took controls and the other started to cram the area. He moved out to make room for the others and decided to do a quick weapons check of his own in the common room. It wasn't the first time he was on assignment with limited intelligence, usually he was the one relaying such information. He knew with the barren planet and harsh environment that his survival skills would be useful. It was good to see his old friends again, but he still felt hollow inside. This was just another mission he thought, indifference consumed his focus and he went through the motions of preparation.
Hadru accepts the rations and drink with a nod, 'Thank you.'

The weapons check was quick, and Hadru had something else on his mind. The ship. The Kouhun Infestation was on his mind, he was curious about the poisonous creatures being on the vessel at one time. The other interesting thing was the trap set in the cockpit. Only a paranoid owner would have such creatures ready to be unleashed. He decided to sweep the ship on his own looking for anymore similar traps. Better to be cautious he thought, or was he being paranoid. Maybe, paranoid is a heightened state of awareness and it helped him be alert. Nothing wrong with a little paranoia he began to convince himself.

Feldon pats Awne on the shoulder.
Feldon: "Those emotions you use can do you some good, but they are best left controlled. I believe that is what Lues had done with his feelings about you. He has underwent a lot of inner turmoil in regards to Mur Eva, Falsoor, and his memory loss. Perhaps you should talk to him on a later date? Look forward to that, but don't pin everything inside on him. I don't want to sound like a droid dispenser of Jedi protocol, but look to the Force for answers. Seek enlightenment at the face of negativity. Learn to channel the negativity into your resolve to step further down the path of wisdom."
Hadru searched the ship with expert scrutiny. He had all the time to do it anyhow. Hadru knew that Kouhun's couldn't of lived that long after they looted the ship off Ordenn. However, he wasn't able to find anything else suspicious. While he was searching, it did occur to him that the droid should not be forgotten. It seemed link to the Kouhun attack.

The droid. Oh yes how did I forget the droid, the hyperdrive, and the trap. Hadru's thoughts were starting to form. It was Hadru's weakness, technology in general. He never really learned how to pilot or mess with computer interfaces. It was definitely something he had put off too long, but he still felt another urge about the droid. Although Hadru's knowledge of droids wasn't expert or skilled even he decided to give it an examination. He thoughts had pondered about why the droid was activated, and he couldn't come to a answer, but it did occur to him that the droid or a device may have been planted. More specifically a transceiver of some sort or recording device. I may have been Hadru's paranoia, but the young man didn't have anything else to do but come up with conspiracy theories.
If someone was recording there conversations, or using some sort of transceiver to sabotage the crew of the ship it could very likely be linked to the droid. The Huttesee code embedded into the droid was also alarming. It was a language Hadru didn't know, and without a protocol droid around he wouldn't be able to translate. That would be his next thing on the agenda, to find someone on board that can understand the language, but after he did an examination of the droid.

Seems to me that people are naturally tainted with lust for things... power being the biggest on that list. People (meaning all species) are naturally curious and wish to grow and better themselves in someway or another. The jedi felt they had the power to over through a supreme chancallor at the end of the Clone Wars and instead started the Great Jedi Purge showing that their power wasn't as great as they thought." Theos now looks Feldon in the face. "Don't get me wrong I don't think that was the whole story about what happened in that affair. Doesn't make sense the jedi would lead many battles defending the republic then turn around and attempt seize control of it, then again I could be wrong about the jedi. Seems to me thou that some people in the squad have issues with jedi and we all know the New Republic has little to no affection towards them. Makes me wonder if Lance here should be talking aloud about his potiental to be a jedi going into a mission where the jedi were told your on the back burner stay out of the way. I don't care either way and i'll tell them where to place their opinions about Lance. If that doesn't help there are other ways," Theos says grinning.
((Theos searches his feelings weather Lances potiental being told to the group would hinder the mission))

Listening to Theos and his version of the force Lance cant help but think, that must be one way some turn to the dark side of the force. "Theos I can`t help what I am, but I am a better person for trying to learn more about it. I have no desire for power, you do have a point though many have fallen to the dark side of the force over the years that might be one reason why."
Lance gives Feldon a bow at his offer of advise "My thanks to you." For the next few hours Lance sits in quite meditation considering Feldons words.
When the food is served Lance takes his helping and laughs at Vor'en`s comment, looking at Feldon "Thanks mom." Lance can`t help but to chuckle at that.

Woroken takes the food offered by Master Feldon, quickly finishing same. The wookiee had been more quiet than normal since receiving the mission briefing. He had been mentally preparing himself for the danger he expected the group to face to save his friend. After scarfing down lunch, he went to the quarters section and began checking his equipment, ensuring his medical kit and pacs were in tip-top shape. Hopefully they wouldn't need usage, but,unfortunately he doubted that would be the case.

Twenty-three hours had passed and the ambient hum of hyperspace travel had lulled everyone on the ship to sleep as they were closing in fast on their destination. Vor'en awoke in his bunk and had a very drowsy feeling. He knew mission time was in one hour and the anticipation was building. He clambered out of his bunk and looked at his squad mates asleep in their bunks. Vor'en figured the only other person awake was Hadru at the cockpit. The soldier knew it was time to wake them up and start getting their minds prepared for the mission.

Awne mumbles softly, curled up in the co-pilots chair where she had at some point fallen asleep; legs curled close over the arm of the chair and tail resting on her stomach. If anyone asked why she had been sleeping in the cockpit she'd only shake her head, not even sure when she had fallen asleep; Still, she was sound asleep and purring in the chair.

Part of Vor'en kind of likes this part, but he suppresses a smile. "Gor and Dor are Team 1, Lance and Theos team 2. Lance you are team leader, Gor you are also ateam leader. Theos you are anit armor, Lance longrange comms. Dor you get the Repeating light blaster." "Any questions? Good lets go!"

Theos was already awake when the sarge started barking out orders remebering himself during times of war doing the same thing. Grabbing his rig Theos sets up and grabs Lances rig as well. Waiting for the small human to wake up and remember he has to lug this heavy thing around Theos can only grin from tendril to tendril at the thought of the little guy being so defiant and insisting about his force hertiage. It makes Theos proud to know someone willing to risk everything to find his true hertiage.
Theos: *Grinning* I'm looking forward to see what kind of power these punny weapons the Republic gave us." He says looking of the blaster cannon that seems puny in his massive arms. "Come Lance the time of action is upon us!"

Gor wasnÂ´t all too happy about this military discipline, especially not the "get up and be ready in the morning"-routine. However, in his life, he had adjusted to sleeping on irregular times. So he got up and once again strapped on his gear. Leaving his quarters, he bumps into VorÂ´en.
"Morning sarge, good to see you up. A good day for a covert insertion, donÂ´t you think?"
Keeping his typical smile on, he starts to scour the ship to find Dor. The other seemed to have some experience in the field, so he expected him to be up as well. It was time to get serious with this mission.

Twenty-three hours more then enough time to rest up and meditate. That is until Vor`en`s orders are bellowed out, hmmm team lead I am sure that will make Theos just that much happier with me since he found out I am a jedi.
Getting a nudge to wake up a little faster from Theos. This might work out he seems in a good mood. "Ok ok I am up." Lance rises and swings the pack over his back "all soldiered up and ready to go!"

These jedi have have faguht hard to earn they place in this mission weather they realize it or not.
((Assuming we are going to meet once again in the comm area))
Theos: "Come Lance the time is upon us to show what this team is made of and why we were picked for the squad. Even if you look funny with the long range comlink strapped to your back."

The wookiee awakes groggily. He was always a heavy sleeper, even when prepping for a mission. He had his supplie salready laid out, so it was a simple matter to gather them and head to head to the main hold. On the way, he makes a quick stop to gather a bit of breakfast, as he didn't know when he would have the opportunity to eat again. He grabbed a couple pieces of fruit and chewed on them as he entered the hold.

Dor was up and moving before his brain recognized it was awake. Same routine. Dress for bed in the clothes you planned to wear. Take the time while lacing your boots to come fully awake.
Now more conscious, Dor grabbed his gear chaotically, knowing there would be time to straighten it out during the final breifing.
Dor joins Gor in the main corridor and they wander back to the common area.

Vor'en enters the bay, all of his gear in place and ready to go. The only thing that seems out of place is the E-11 on the side of his pack. "All right people line up, Weapons check."
Vor'en moves down the line of soldiers with a practiced hand, checking over each ones gear and weapons. After he has finished he address his squad. "Ok, when hit the ground Hardu will be out frist to scout, 1st team will check left 2nd will check right. I want to secure the LZ before we move head with the mission. After that we will move on to the target. Is that clear!"

Vor'en does a thorough inspection of his squad and permits them to stay close together, enjoying their last few minutes of downtime. Roughly thirty minutes pass, and Hadru cuts in the sublight engines from the freighters cockpit. Awne assists Hadru immediately by setting a good heading to keep the ship stable. The large planet of Vjun filled the cockpit as the ship came out of the hyperspace wormhole.
The planet had a light and dark brownish look throughout the surface that screamed of a barren world and expansive canyons. There were clouds sporadically spread across the murky globe. The clouds were vast and thick. It was a grim foreboding of inclement weather. Indeed, was a sight to see that such a huge planet appeared so lifeless. There was no communication being sent to the cockpit, which was also a sign of desolation. Awne is able to pick up three small ships approaching from visual scanning, which seemed to be of a starfighter make. Although she couldn't identify them yet because of their distance, they were rapidly approaching the freighter.

As the ship enters real space and Awne detects incoming starships Hadru seems to tense up a bit,'I haven't received the usual Message to Spacers Greeting. I expect they want to deliver the message in person, I'm betting those are not friendlies, and I didn't think we would be noticed. I need work on my piloting skills.

Aside to Gor, Dor quips, "Do you think it's too late to switch? I'm rightpawed."
During the final breifing, Dor finishes stowing his gear and loading his weapons.
While alert and calm, Dor seems unsure of the size of the large rifle. After muddling
around a bit, he settles on a upward orientation. Knowing these insertions are
rarely smooth, he thumbs on the safety and drops to squat in place.
With his other paw, he cinches into a retaining strap and waits for the

A beeping sound emanates from the the hypertransceiver controls. It was an incoming message. Vor'en saw the flashing button and guessed it was mostly likely from the approaching fighter. The ships seemed to be a good distance away, but they were closing on the freighter very quickly.

Responding to the fighters. "Nope sorry can't help you. I need this tub to earn my way in the galaxy. No ship, no creds." Vor'en keeps trying to put distance between the Starshade and the fighters. After replying to the fighters He grabs his commlink. "Lt. we have some fighters shadowing us they are communicating and I have tryed to put as much distance between us and them but they are being presistant. They seem to want to trade ships with us."

Keep the shields down until you absolutely know of a threat. Once again, I don't want to go on alert, but its better safe than sorry. Announce battle stations over the comm please Sergeant.

Awne concentrates through the Force and her own instinct. This was a mission, and the people around this system were largely unknown to her. The pilot of the fighter did seem like he had nothing to lose. She believed it was wise to go to battle stations just to be ready for anything. She tells Vor'en that she thinks it was a good choice by the Lieutenant and that they should be alert.

It was better for him to stay out of the spacers way, and let them handle their business.

Woroken gets to close to the medical room from the the main access corridor. Feldon and Lt. Baruush seemed to be routinely checking supplies, making sure everything was in order. Feldon nods politely to Woroken.
Feldon: "This could be fun eh? Don't Wookiee's love a good fight?"
Dorijidan ran to the place he was growing very accustomed to, the Engineering bay. He might as well sleep in here the way things were going. He began reading on the ship's condition, getting familiar with the setup of the ship.
Lance went to the cockpit access corridor, and stopped just short of the cockpit. He could see Hadru peering into the cockpit and talking with Awne and Vor'en. He took a left into the small room that housed the communications, sensors, and shielding array. It was a cramped space filled with different computers for different tasks. The marine sat down in a swivel chair, ready to perform any task at a moment's notice.

Theos and Vor'en both recognize what the ships are doing. The three starfighters are forming an attack position. One ship goes on point, while two fighter hold back to cover the point ship's lead. It was a classic three ship cover and point formation. They had seen this over the years of experience in the military and star battles. Theos powers up his quad gun and listens to it come to life with energy. His targeting display reticule opens up and begins scanning for the fighters. Theos puts on his com headset to communicate with the others onboard the ship. He knew a fight was imminent. The ships were still gaining on the freighter.

As he gets there, he sees the human - Lance - already taking a seat by the console, operating the sensors in order to aid the gunners. He notices the man seems a little uncomfortable.

Vor'en manipulates the controls of the ship and pulls back on the pilot stick to make the *Starshade* take a rounded 90 degree right turn. Vjun was now on your left. Vor'en eased on the throttle to increase the speed, you hear the ship shake gently as it is being pushed beyond its limits. The speed was obvious to the gunners that they were going to make an attack run. The men behind the quad guns saw the three fighters coming squarely into their reticules.

Theos sees a blip swing onto his targeting computer, the fighter was aligned perfectly in his sights. He let loose a torrent of quad laser blasts. The blaster bolts struck the fighter directly in the front part of its shields. The shields were chipped away. The *Starshade* continued to fly head on towards its enemies.
Lance swivels his chair back and forth frantically as he is calculating data. He gets an estimated trajectory from the enemy fighters and uploads it to his friend's targeting computer. Something else also caught his eye, he was getting a good layout of Vjun. *Knowledge Tactics as a reaction here if you wish.*
Awne calmly tries to flip switches and analyze the flight path. Vor'en seemed to be working a little fast for her though, as she has never been formally trained in piloting.
Vor'en watches as the enemy starfighers continue on their course towards the freighter. The lead ship unleashes a spray of automatic blaster bolts. The bolts skip across the deflector shields of the freighter. The other ship on the lead ship's wing followed up with another spray of blaster cannon fire. The energy blasts collided with the freighter's hull, the shields absorbing some of the damage.

Gor' Ak reaches over Lance and attempts to punch in information to the computer in front of him. Information is instantly uploaded to the computer. The ships are Subpro Corporation Z-95 Headhunters. Their weapons and shields are powered up, and it is a gargantuan sized starfighter. The starfighters have two weapons and these ships do not have a military marking. There were just civilians operating the ships.
Meanwhile, Woroken can hear the chaos echo outside of the ship. The Wookiee stares at the closed landing ramp with patience. It was doubtful anything was going to happen over here, at least that's what he felt like.
In the cockpit, Vor'en saw the ships getting very close. He was going to have to perform evasive maneuvers or come to a full stop. If he wasn't careful, he would fly past a starfighters firing arc and be hit on his weak side. He realized this could lead to a dogfight.

Vor'en sees that a collision is imminent from his daring attack run. He tells everyone to strap themselves in if they haven't already. Both pilots can see the starfighters growing in the cockpit as you were getting very close. Just as the ships were about to collide, Vor'en yanks on the control stick and the *Starshade* dives downward violently. The lead starfighter tries to match the quick maneuvering of the Sergeant's piloting ability but is unable. The ship travels downward away from the starfighters, and once Vor'en gets enough distance, he pulls up on the ship to level it out. The starfighters were now flying over the top of the freighter. The men in the gun positions could see the exposed underbellies of the Headhunter fighters.
Theos swivels his chair and points upward at the lead fighter. He unleashes a torrent of vicious quad energy blasts. The lead fighter flies right into the bolts and is immediately engulfed in a fiery explosion.

However, on the other screen, he is bringing up information on the planet below. He sees that there are many storms that occur on Vjun.

Awne reasserts her focus and frantically tries to keep up with Vor'en's aggressive flight pattern. She is able to gracefully apply maneuvering jets to keep the freighter stable as it dives and pulls back up again. The Farghul catches that both quad guns will not be able to engage, and she assists in making the ship perform a barrel roll so all weapons will get a shot. Thankfully, the artificial gravity and inertial dampeners were working well, otherwise the ship would be a tin can full of tossed bodies.

As the *Starshade* continues to the opposite direction of the Headhunters, one of them dives diagonally and gets right behind the freighter's trail. The ship was matching the freighter's speed, and it was evident to Vor'en that this was the start of a dogfight. The other fighter executes a quick loop and triggered a missile launch at the light freighter. The missile misses the *Starshade*, and the Z-95 continues to go down away from the dogfight. *There are two starfighters left; one is traveling away from the dogfight, and the other one is in the dogfight.*
Hadru watches with anticipation as he sees the Z-95 bearing down on his ship. The reticule on his targeting computer beeped frantically as he tried to swivel the ship into his cross hairs. He fired a few shots and the blasts went low beneath the starfighter. It seemed that these type of weapons were quite foreign to him.

The veteran warrior slams on the drag fins of the freighter as the Headhunter flies right into the front firing arc of the *Starshade.*Vor'en fires a missile straight ahead and it connects with the small craft, jolting it violently out of control. It spins for a few seconds trying to regain its bearings. In the gunner's bay, Theos sees a perfect opportunity to capitalize
and fires a barrage of laser blasts at the stumbling fighter. The energy connects center-mass and the Z-95 is vaporized in a tremendous explosion. Vor'en straightens out the ship towards the huge planet. As the noise died down in the freighter, you heard a voice speaking as if he had been talking this whole time.

While he was doing this, he attempted to aid the gunners with more targeting coordinates. However, he was just not very adept with computers to work them well under pressure.
Vor'en kept the ship on a level heading towards Vjun. He had just heard Lance's recommendation to head into the storm clouds if he needed to. All of a sudden, Vor'en hears Awne unbelting her crash webbing. Vor'en looks back to see Awne leaping over his head. Awne lands crouched on top of the pilot console in front of him. The soldier tried to look past Awne to see where he was going but she wouldn't move. Awne let out a feral growl and swung her claws at Vor'en. Vor'en was able to get his arms up just in time to absorb the impact from the blow. The sergeant had no idea what was going on with her!

Vor'en can only manage to keep the freighter on a straight course at this point. He is unable to do much else as Awne was blocking the way to his instruments and partially obscuring his visual scanning.
Hadru sees the last Headhunter desperately trying to gain on his ship. He sees the fighter hovering beneath him, as if the Z-95 was about to pull up with guns blazing. Hadru fires another torrent of quad energy and misses completely. Hadru swivels over a bit to see a missile turning around in the distance and heading straight for the freighter. It collides
with the back portion of the ship. The *Starshade* rocks violently. Lance glanced at the deflector shields and it seemed that they were still holding well.

Lance tracks the Z-95 well on his computer readout. He gathers the data and feeds trajectory information to Theos's quad gun. The gun should compensate now for slight maneuvers by the Headhunter, giving Theos an edge. Lance continues to work diligently despite the noise in the cockpit and Lues's seizure on his conscience.
In the cockpit, Awne continued to harass Vor'en with vicious claw strikes. The soldier was able to raise his arms in defense as her claws were tearing holes in his republic work uniform. The Farghul was perched on the cockpit in her unrelenting assault. Vor'en attempted to reach forward for the instruments because the ship was now out of control. The Farghul Jedi sees him reaching and instinctively unclips her lightsaber from her belt. She flicked the lightsaber on. The deep purple blade snap-hissed to life with humming energy. The Jedi brought the lightsaber to her side and unleashed a swing downwards at the sergeant. Vor'en was able to slide to the left a bit as the lightsaber just barely grazed his right shoulder. The soldier could feel a slight burn in his shoulder. The energy blade sheared the right side of the chair off brilliantly. Vor'en had to stand up now as the chair could no longer support him.
Theos was observing in the quad gun bay as the Z-95 was still on the ship's tail and was not being shaken. Theos watches in horror as a missile is launched, but thankfully, it misses the freighter completely. The Headhunter was so close to the ship that you could see a human pilot in the cockpit.
Hadru abandons his quad gun and climbs the ladder of the gun entry way. He gets into the main access corridor and sprints towards the cockpit. He arrives at the area to find that Awne is swinging her lightsaber at the defensive Vor'en.

Vor'en swiftly draws his blaster and fires at Awne. The Farghul is able to get her paw up to deflect Vor'en's blaster hand, sending the stun wave flying at the transparisteel viewport. The stun blast harmlessly dissipates on the transparisteel. He was extremely close to Awne and this situation seemed to have given her the advantage. As Vor'en seemed to have his hands full, the ship came to a complete stop. It still had some distance to travel to Vjun.
Theos whirred the quad gun to center alignment as the Headhunter was closing fast on the freighter. The soldier seemed to have gotten a bit nervous, and his palms were sweaty. He held his breath and fired at the Z-95. The energy blasts flew harmlessly over the top of the starfighter. The ship had stopped, and they were now a sitting target. The Z-95 was rushing forward to the tail end of the *Starshade. Woroken 29, Vorâ€™en 26, Theos 19, Lance 17, Awne 16, Starfighters 13, Dorijidan 10, Hadru 9, Gorâ€™ Ak 5. It is now Lance's turn.*

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-16 19:30:37)

Lance breaks into a full sprint away from the systems room. He speeds through the cockpit corridor into the main access hall. The soldier takes a left down the circular hallway and runs into the medical room. He can see Feldon, Woroken, and the Lieutenant holding Lues down. They are attempting to put the restraining binders from the medical bed on his limbs. The Mon Calamarian points her webbed hand at Lance.
Lt. Baruush: "Everything is under control here private. Please go and assist Sergeant Vor'en in the cockpit!"
Back in the cockpit, Awne continues to crouch down on the instrument panel. After she successfully sliced the pilot chair in half, she rears back her right hand to attempt a stab. She plunges forward with all her might to skewer Vor'en in the midsection. Vor'en sidesteps just a bit to feel the energy blade graze the right side of his stomach. He can feel a burning hole in his armor.
Theos sits in the quad gun bay and watches as the Z-95 gets very close to the freighter. Once it seems like it is about to collide with the ship, it executes a loop to do another attack run. Once it completes the loop, it is a good distance away from the *Starshade.* Theos estimated the starfighter had an excellent bead on the ship now that they were at a complete stand still. The Headhunter fires a missile and it hits the back portion of the ship. The explosion jolts the ship moderately.
In the engineering bay, steam begins to hiss out from the engines. The ship was rocking and the lights were fluctuating with damage. Dorijidan knew the ship's power was waning with the attacks. Dorijidan quickly moved to the ship status display and began punching in commands. The shields seemed to be holding at 35 percent power. The hull integrity was taking moderate damage. The power of the freighter was fading slowly. Dorijidan ripped the panel off the power supply and began tinkering with the innards of the ship. He pulls out his hydrospanner and uses it to splice some wires. Dor rewires some cables and the ship's power returns to 100 percent. He had successfully adverted some crisis for now.
*Order: Woroken 29, Vorâ€™en 26, Theos 19, Lance 17, Awne 16, Starfighters 13, Dorijidan 10, Hadru 9, Gorâ€™ Ak 5. It is now Hadru's turn*

Hadru was confused at the scene in the cockpit, he didn't know how to react to Awne attacking Vor'en, but he knew this wasn't normal. It wasn't just the fact she was attacking Vor'en, but that she was ready to pounce showing off her feral roots. In the past maybe, but she was a padawan, a Jedi in training and a jedi has no emotion. The commotion going on with Lue at the same time was concerning, there was always a link between the too emotionally.
Hadru shouts at Awne,'Awne! What are you doing! Calm down! Put your lightsaber away! What are you doing!'
Hadru doesn't think his words will stop her, but he tries anyway. He has his weapon lowered, but ready he switch's the blaster pistol to stun slowly trying to hide his moments.

The Farghul growled and brought her lightsaber back in a defying motion. She seemed very aggressive and ready to attack. Vor'en stood in front of Awne in an alert stance.
*Still want to attack her?*

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-16 20:49:53)

Hadru reacts to Awne's ferocious response and raises his weapon. He discharges a stun blast but the Farghul quickly slides a bit to the right, dodging the stun wave completely. Awne was indeed a nimble target to shoot at.
While Lance is receiving orders from his Lieutenant, something happens all of a sudden. He can hear a loud thrumming sound in his head. Pain shot through his head with intensity of a flaring star. He instinctively grabbed his ears to shut out the loud noise and alleviate the pain. Lance shut his eyes and could only see an image of himself touching Awne's hand. The thought was trapped in his head. He crumpled down to his knees in agony. The Lieutenant walked over to the private and kneeled next to him.
Lt. Baruush: "What's wrong with you?"

While GorÂ´s natural curiosity was nagging him to try and fins out exactly what was happening around the ship - because obviously there was a lot of things going on, he just knew it - his survival instincts told him to stay right where he were.
He was quite suprised when the ship suddenly slowed to a halt, but before he was able to comm the cockpit to ask what was going on, the ship rocked violently. Running his fingers over the boards, trying to asses some kind of status report, he nearly shouts over the comm:
"Dor, what the heck is going on? The was some hit we just took, and the shields seems to be on the brink of collapsing"
He works frequently to recailbrate the sensors as they seems to have been thrown out of line by the heavy impact.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-17 14:29:22)

Gor' Ak continues to relay targeting information to Theos. Although the ship had come to a complete stop, it was obvious that he still had to pull his weight on the freighter. The Z-95 was fairly easy to predict now as it was most likely going to keep executing attack runs until the *Starshade* was destroyed. However, the fighter pilots did originally say they wanted the ship. The starfighter may just pummel it until surrender.
In the med bay, Woroken struggles to grab Lues Van's wrists. He is unsuccessful, even with aid from Feldon. Lues has a surge of violent thrashing, then he passes out completely. Feldon looks at Woroken, partially out of breath with a surprised look.
Feldon: "Secure him...this is very strange."
Feldon and Woroken lock the bed binders onto Lues. The Jedi Knight could no longer resist as he was out of consciousness. The Lieutenant nods to Feldon and Woroken, and then looks back at Lance. Lues Van was restrained on the medical bed.
Lt. Baruush: "Can you continue? or do you need medical attention?"
The pain completely fades from Lance, and he could no longer see any images in his mind.

The shock of the over loaded power coupling had burned him pretty badly but all traces were gone now. The room was full of noise and light, people shouting. Xander sits up and looks around. He sees the jedi Feldon and Woro trying to restrain someone. He finally recognizes the person Rith! Xander's anger flares for a second but he fights it down, he wasn't Rith any more he was calling himself Lues now. Vor'en claimed he had been reformed and allowed to rejoin the Jedi.

Vor'en is not having a good day. His friend is trrying to kill him and his ship is getting shot to pieces and the mission was going to a hutts back side in a hurry. This seems familiar to him some how, then it dons on him this is just like back on Tatoonie all those years ago. Quick drawing his commlink Vor'en call the medbay. "Feldon this has happened before back on Tatoonie remeber Lues complained about something with his head and then he would blank out. It must be effecting Awne also." Vor'en hopes that Feldon remebers what had happen back then.
Turning his attention back to Awne firing another stun bolt at her. Hoping that this time he might hit something other then air.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-17 15:30:08)

As Feldon receives the message via his comlink, he nods to Xander as he is getting out of his medical bed.
Feldon: "I'm not sure what to make of this Sergeant. Lues has just passed out. Make sure everyone's weapons are on stun when dealing with Awne. This is definitely not like her, and I couldn't sense this coming at all."
Vor'en listens to the communication and raises his blaster pistol at the Farghul Jedi. The soldier aims down the sights of the weapon quickly. He fires a stun wave and it connects center mass of her body. The Farghul shakes a bit, and she seemed visibly affected by the stun bolt. She seemed to be losing her balance while she was perched atop the instruments.
Theos looked at his targeting computer as the attack vector for the Z-95 was well scouted. However, the ship was some distance away from the freighter's range. Theos attempted to lead the ship as best he could as he unleashed a hail of laser blasts. The energy beams flew past the starfighter harmlessly. The Headhunter continued on its straightforward attack run towards the light freighter. Theos was beginning to lose focus, he had been doing exceptionally well up until this point. Perhaps the pressure was getting to him?

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-17 16:22:46)

Lance sprints from the med bay into the main access corridor. He takes a right turn down the hallway at the cockpit access corridor. He comes up behind Hadru, and he can barely see Awne from the cramped cockpit. All he can really see of her is the ignited purple lightsaber. If he was to fire in there it could be bad as all his companions were bunched close together. The two seated cockpit did not provide much space to move around. Essentially, it just provided enough room for the pilot and the co-pilot. This left Hadru and Lance to be peering inside of the area.
Despite the partial weary appearance of Awne, she lashes out with another swipe from her lightsaber. It was a side sweeping stroke and Vor'en jumped back into the crumpled pilot chair, the blade skimmed the armor of his stomach. The soldier was quickly tiring in his evasion of the quick Farghul and her sword.
Theos watches the Headhunter intently as it accelerates to attack speed on the *Starshade.* It closes distance with startling speed and fires a burst of blaster fire. The energy blasts connect at the back of the freighter. Gor' Ak watched as the shields were quickly failing at 10 percent capacity. Hull integrity seemed to be gradually declining.

Back in the quad gun bay, Theos readjusts his targeting computer for the repetitive attack run. The ship was still a short distance away, which would make his aiming a bit tougher than point blank range. He unleashed a torrent of blaster fire, only to find the bolts skimmed past the starfighter without dealing damage. Theos had obviously lost focus.

He could sense as she existed in the Force, but an empty presence nonetheless. As he speaks to her, she seems to take no visible reaction to his words. She brandishes her lightsaber at the end of his words, and she let's out a defiant growl in spite of everything he has said. Awne performs a front flip over Vor'en and prepares to stab him in the back with a lethal strike.

Just as Awne is about to complete her finishing blow; the Jedi's lightsaber powers down, and she collapses in between Vor'en and the co-pilot's seat. You look down at her and the Farghul's eyes were closed. Just from looking at her, you believed she was unconscious.
Theos diligently monitors the Z-95. It had just completed its loop and it had accelerated to attack speed. Once it gets within point blank range of the *Starshade,*it shoots a burst of laser blasts. The lasers skim the hull of the ship harmlessly, as the deflector shields completely diverted the shots. The starfighter continues on its course for the freighter, likely to keep his current attack pattern.

Dorijidan accesses the shield display on the systems console. The shields were fading at 10 percent power. He opens a panel on the wall and overrides the power control. He then sits back down at the systems display and drains power from other portions of the ship to augment the shields. He successfully does this and the shields get bumped up to 30 percent power. Dorijidan was able to skillfully divert the power in a way that it did not harm any of the ship's functions while effectively boosting the deflector shields.

The veteran soldier takes the Jedi's lightsaber and drops it in his cargo pocket of his pant leg. Indeed, the New Republic combat camoflauge (brown/tan pattern) had many useful pouches on it. Vor'en kneels down as the pilot's seat was destroyed, and powers the sublight engine up to minimum speed. He aligns the ship back on course to the huge brown planet of Vjun. Within a little bit, you would be hitting the atmosphere. The ship would be undergoing the heat of reentry. Vor'en notes that as he is handling the pilot stick that everything seemed to be running well. This ship was very durable.

He quickly notices the Z-95 on direct course with the freighter, it was in a dashing attack run. The starfighter was attempting to close the distance that Vor'en just made in an attempt to reach Vjun.

He grabs his rifle and makes way to the medbay after over hearing that the rouge feline is now being dragged there. Someone must make sure that the prisioner is watched over and isn't a jedi.
Theos: Walks into the medbay and looks for the Lt.. "Ma'am, i'll volunteer to keep first watch over the jedi until further action can be taken about her attempt to end the life of an non comissioned officer of the New Republic and sabatoge our mission." He says as he makes sure the ammo pack is fully charged.

"I think that is a good idea, Awne. I can accompany you, just to be sure you are steady.

He followed closely behind her, both making sure she could walk under her own power, and also making sure she did not have another "episode."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-24 16:24:39)

Awne firmly plants her feet into the metallic grating of the floor beneath her. She slowly begins to move towards the Med Bay, despite the hammering of the ship's hull by blaster fire. With each step Awne takes, her health is restoring quickly. She soon finds that she feels fine, almost as if a giant burden has been taken off her mind.
Xander watches the Z-95 on a direct course with the *Starshade.* The starfighter uses a thruster boost and quickly closes distance on the freighter. It fires a burst of blaster shots from its triple blaster cannons. However, the maneuverable freighter is able to swivel away from the shots as it continues toward the huge Vjun. The Headhunter was not being shook from hot pursuit.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-25 18:57:08)

Dorijidan reasserts his focus on the shielding array. The blue monitor lit up his face despite the fading illumination due to power fluctuation. He had already drawn power from less essential systems, now the key was to keep it well circulated. The Bothan types in a few commands and tinkers with the power wiring. Within seconds, the shields are galvanized from excess power on the freighter.
*It is now Hadru's turn.*

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-26 17:26:30)

Hadru watches as Woro and Awne head to the Med Bay. He turns around and faces the cockpit. He gets behind Vor'en and takes a seat in the co-pilot's chair. Hadru monitors the ship's course, and Vor'en had plotted them on a direct course for Vjun. The scout carefully adjusts the heading of the ship via the co-pilot's instruments. He then makes sure the maneuvering jets are functioning properly in case they had to make quick maneuvers or evasive action. At moment's notice, he could apply the jets in danger. Vor'en seems to be thankful as his piloting job had gotten a little easier.
*It is now Gor Ak's turn.*

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-27 17:12:39)

Gor pushes a button to keep the sensors locked on the Headhunter, he was sure that he had this starfighter tracked easily. It should be rather simple to hit the fighter now as he was skillfully feeding Xander targeting data, though Theos did have some trouble.
Woroken and Awne move quickly through the cockpit access corridor. From here, they go into the circular hallway of the main access corridor. They take a left into the cramped med bay and observe the people at work. Medical containers and tools were sprawled out across the smooth gray floor. The lights seemed to be flickering in this room as well. However; Feldon, Baruush, and Kel-Yun were working together to get a diagnosis on the unconscious Lues Van. Master Lorhas looks to Woro and Awne.
Lorhas: "What seems to be the problem?"
*Woroken 29, Vorâ€™en 26, Xander 20, Theos 19, Lance 17, Awne 16, Starfighters 13, Dorijidan 10, Hadru 9, Gorâ€™ Ak 5. It is now Vor'en's turn.*

Awne scratches her ear, tail flicking in her confusion "Episode? Masterr I honestly don't know what he's talking about..I think I may have passed out at somepoint forr when I woke up I was being carrrried." She looks to Lues, moving to his side quickly "How is he?"

Vor'en watches with steady nerves as he looks past the framed durasteel cockpit of the YT-2000 onto the planet. The looming Vjun became clearer with brown rocky terrain spread across the planet face. You couldn't see any indication of civilization; all the pilot saw was desert, canyons, and cliffs laced together in a tapestry of barren desolation. Dark clouds flashing with lightning sporadically dotted the sky as you were on rapid approach. The view was quickly compromised as the cockpit was illuminated by the brilliance of light by the heat of re-entry.
Xander uses his targeting computer to guide him in his aiming despite the blinding light. The dexterous man hits the pursuing ship with extreme ease. The ship goes up in a fiery ball and vaporizes shortly after. *Everyone receives 866 experience.*
In the medical bay, Master Lorhas looks at Awne with concern. Feldon and Baruush seem hard at work dealing with the downed Jedi Knight.
Lorhas: "Lues seems ok, but we haven't completed our analysis. Feldon should let us know shortly. Perhaps you should lie down on the bed and let us take a look at you as well since you went unconscious."
The Jedi Master motions to the medical bed next to Lues with a gentle warmth.

## Re: Starshade

### **Frost** (2008-09-28 23:22:17)

Xander watches the starfighter explode. He grins as he activates the comms.

He scans the area making sure there are no more fighters. Not seeing any he unstraps himself from the turret and heads back to the cockpit.

Awne looks around for the other medical bed, not happy that it was farther from lues than she'd like it to be. Still, maybe a look over wouldn't hurt; a fainting spell wouldn't be good on a mission. She moves to the bed with a nod and sigh, sitting on the bed to await instruction. However the speech about her trying to kill someone had her fur bristling "what arre you talking about?? I wouldn't hurrt anyone on this crrew, even a jumpy one like you!" She grumbles under her breath, twil twitching in aggitation "I didn't trry to hurrt anyone I just passed out that's all, when I woke up Worro and Hadrru werre carrrrying me herre so I got up and walked with Worro."

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-29 00:25:40)

The Jedi Master motions to the Lieutenant to relax.
Lorhas: "It's ok, I sense something is amiss here, something we cannot take at face value. I don't think Awne was herself at the time of the attack."
Baruush: "I don't know what your intentions are Jedi, but she must be restrained. We can't allow her to compromise the mission."
Feldon: "I sense it also, I don't believe it was her fault. But we'll keep her restrained to rest everyone's minds. She's sincere."
The young Jedi looks at Awne, attempting to lock the restraining binds on Awne from the medical bed.
Feldon: "Please let me lock you in ok?"
Feldon says this with a smile in a hope to comfort her.

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 00:32:54)

Awne did -not- like the idea of being locked in, especially if her friends needed her. Still...if they thought it would put the others at ease...
She sighs again, tail flicking to show her dislike at the situation as she lays down giving him her hands to restrain. She keeps her eyes on Lues, giving off a small sad mew, she had been hoping to at least be at his side when he woke up. She looks up to Feldon after a minute "I didn't do anything Masterr Feldon..." she says softly.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-29 00:38:12)

Feldon: "That's what I'm trying to prove, let me analyze your condition."

## Re: Starshade

### **zerah** (2008-09-29 00:46:27)

Awne nods her head, relaxing as much as she could for being restraind. She wasn't about to look to the soldier that was 'guarding' her, rather unhappy with him and the talk about her trying to hurt her friends. Still she looks to Lues, eyes growing soft at the sight of him.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-29 00:51:35)

Lues was completely unconscious, he looked at peace though. His Jedi robes were in disarray and there was some sweat on his forehead from the struggle he had with the others in the med bay. The knight's chest was heaving up and down.
Feldon: "Let me tend to him first. I'll get to you shortly."
The Mon Calamarian pushed a button on the wall comm.
Baruush: "Sergeant Vor'en, give me a sitrep."
Vor'en and Hadru watched as the heat around the cockpit dissipated. The ship was now within Vjun's atmosphere. They were rapidly descending towards the clouds below. The freighter would be at the surface in a matter of seconds.

## Re: Starshade

### **ganthet** (2008-09-29 01:24:12)

Vor'en switches on the comm. "Bandits destroyed and we will be on the ground in a moment." He brings the ship down, try to set it down as smoth as possiable. "As far as the ship damage been kind of busy so you will have to ask the others." He makes a few adjustments. "How is Awne Lt.. Has Feldon figured out what is wrong with her?" Vor'en hopes that his friend is alright and able to help with the mission, he was going to need all the help he could get.

## Re: Starshade

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-29 01:28:51)

Feldon kindly moves the Lieutenant out of the way so he can send a transmission.
Feldon: "We're going to need Lues because he had a sense of where to take us, he can't really do anything right now though. I guess we can just land anywhere at the moment until he awakes."
Vor'en and Hadru observe the rolling desert and red-rocked canyons as they fly a few hundred meters above the surface. The area which you were flying in was gloomy and cloudy, rain had begun to pummel the transparisteel of the cockpit. It was a little dark, but it was due to the lack of sunlight from the heavy cloud cover. It was morning here from the position of the sun when you flew to this section of the planet. Vor'en had to switch on the lights to get a better view. They visually scanned the surface and estimated that any patch of sand would serve as a excellent landing spot, but there seemed to be nothing on the planet as far as they could tell. Although you did spot a few run down settlements, they seemed completely devoid of any life. There were no speeders on the ground or ships traveling to or from the towns. Vor'en was also disturbed that he hadn't received any communications from anyone. *You can make a knowledge galactic lore check here as a reaction.

Kel-Yun Lorhas observes Lance's statement. He walks over to him and speaks to him in the cluttered med bay. Xander [hide]You sense the planet is bogged down by the dark side. You can sense faint signs of life here and there, but everything is shrouded by the dark energies. You can sense Mur Eva in great pain in the distance.[/hide] seems to be in meditation.
Lorhas: "This is most disturbing indeed, would you like to have Feldon take a look at you as well?"
Woroken:[hide]You sense through the Force that this place is heavy in the Dark Side. You have trouble making anything out beyond that. The presence of the dark side is clouding everything.[/hide]
Hadru looks into the pouring rain of Vjun and scans the desert for any life signs. He can't see anything very well in this downpour. He calms his mind and opens up to the Force. [hide]You feel the Dark Side tingling up your spine with an eerie chill. Past the presence of the dark side, you sense a few life forms here and there. You can feel an even larger group of life forms further away from where you're at. You guess something is alive down there.[/hide]
Hadru opens his eyes and uses the scanners. Though slightly less powerful than the system's sensors, he is able to pick up a single life form near the ship.
Gor 'Ak detects a strange feeling in his body after the freighter gets closer to the surface of Vjun. [hide]You can't sense anything but a strange disturbance.[/hide]
Back in the systems room, Dorijidan attempts to reroute power to the shields. He has a bit of trouble splicing the wires, and fails at his attempt.
In the cockpit, Hadru gives Vor'en an assessment of the life forms near the area. Vor'en nods and decelerates the atmospheric thrusters on the *Starshade.* Hadru assists by powering the landing jets. Vor'en maneuvers the ship into a big open area of sand, littered with rocks around it. The area seems to grow gloomier as you descend closer to the ground. The landing cycle is initiated smoothly and the gears touch down carefully on the sand of Vjun. You can see past the viewport nothing but sand, rain, and cliffs in the distance.

"I feel the darkness on the planet its dark very dark, I also feel Mur Eva she is in great pain."

Everyone in the Med Bay watches as Lues gains consciousness suddenly. He awakes very peacefully. Feldon speaks to him as Lues looks up.
Feldon: "You ok?"
Lues: "Well, if feeling ok equals feeling like a bantha stampede ran over your head then yes. I feel a great disturbance here. Did we make it to Vjun?"
Feldon: "Yes, we have just landed. We're going to need you to help us find Mur Eva."
Lues: "I'll need to have a look outside, so I can get a bearing on where I'm at. I can't believe this condition is flaring up again."
Feldon: "I know, we haven't seen this out of you since Tatooine."
Lues: "What's wrong with Awne?"
Feldon: "She attacked Vor'en, we sense something is wrong with her."
Lues: "Oh my...I don't know what to say."
The Jedi Master steps up and speaks to the Jedi Knight.
Lorhas: "We mustn't worry about the setbacks right now, we have to focus more on the mission. Mur Eva's in pain, let's get to the bottom of this quickly."
The Lieutenant comms up to the cockpit.
Baruush: "Sergeant, get your men in formation, prepare to debark for the mission."
Lues is released from his medical bed and he begins walking to the boarding ramp.

As Vor'en sets the ship down and powers the engine down he flips on the ships comms. "Ok squad meet me in the cargo bay for finial briefing ." Vor'en gets up and let's Hardu finish with the checks and power down. "I am heading to check on Awne then to grab my gear and get these guys in some kind of order. When you are finished meet me there." Vor'en leaves the cocpit and heads to the med bay to check on Awne.
When he enters the med bay it looks like everyone is taking a nap. He turns to the Lt. "Ma'am we are down and there appears to be some life forms that could be taking an interest in the ship. I don't what they are and i would like to secure the Land Zone quickly if we could." He looks over at Xander and Awne. "Xander I am going to need your and Hardus help getting the LZ secured. You two will make up the thrid two man team I need, this work for you?" He sees that Awne is restraened. He looks at Feldon. "What is this? I am going to need her out there not tied up in here. She is not going to be a danger, She was not herself when she attacked me and you know that." Vor'en cannot contain some of the anger that has crept into his voice at this point. "I have her Saber, she is no threat to anyones safety anymore."

Lues stops at the med bay exit.
Lues: "If it is my fault, I apologize. I don't know what's happening to me. Let's concentrate on saving Mur Eva. I'm a Jedi, I will do my best to uphold the Code and help anyway possible."
The Mon Calamarian nods in respect to Vor'en.
Baruush: "That sounds good Sergeant. Quickly secure the LZ and do your final equipment check if time permits. I'll give a hasty brief and then you'll be on your way. That is, if Lues determines we're in the right area. And, I believe the Farghul Jedi should go with you. If she does attack again I'd rather have her out in the open desert than the sensitive areas of the ship. I doubt any restraints are going to hold down a Jedi. The men probably won't like it, so you are in charge of her sergeant. Watch her every move. Remember this mission is under our command first."

Aymaric walks caustiously towards the ship in front of him, hands outside his torn and battered cloak. He has no reservations about dying today, he just wants to have one hot meal first. His cut and swollen hands tell anyone that he has not just been out for a stroll in this hostile environment, his walk is barely a stagger, and his clothing underneath the cloak might be considered rags to even the neediest of Coruscants poor.

Apon reaching there he grabs his gear and checks over his weapons and other gear. "Ok We divide into two man teams you allready know who you are with. I need Hardu and Xander to scout ahead after we secure the LZ. Let's head to the ramp and get this done quickly people, move out."

Xander immediately notices a person (Aymaric) standing on the sand. The rain was coming down heavy at the moment, and it seemed to have a slight tingle if it hits exposed skin. Xander was not able to see anything off in the distance except sand dunes and cliffs surrounding this particular area. Xander was not able to see anyone in the immediate area besides this lone person. The sky was cloudy and dark, with just a bit of sunlight peeking through. The part of the sky you did see, seemed like a reddish color. Everything seemed to have a brown tint or red tint to it when looking at the general area. It definitely teemed with a desolate sense. Lues steps right next to Xander on the boarding ramp and nods to him.
Lues Van: "Who is this? Is it safe around here?"

Awne follows Vor'en, yes she still had her dagger, and her claws and her training in hand to hand combat but damn did she miss the security of having her saber on her hip. She only sighs, hoping he'd give it back eventually as they move to the ramp, her tail waving slowly while her ears flick on her head. They perk up though at the sight of Lues and Xander only to droop again and twitch in a curious manner as to why the mando had his gun pointing at something.

The Jedi Knight walked down the ramp to make way for the Republic squad that was gathering into formation. He stepped on the damp sand in front of Aymaric. Aymaric was able to get a good glimpse at the Jedi Knight. He was wearing nothing but a black tunic with brown shoulder sashes. He had black gloves, dark-brown pants, and glossy black boots. His hair was long and blondish/white. He seemed to have a scar on the right part of his face that looked as if it cut into his eye a bit. That eye next to the scar seemed to be bloodshot. He didn't appear to have any weapons on him. He had quite the serious demeanor for a young face.

Hearing the message from Xander, Vor'en quickly heads down the boarding ramp. He has his carbine rasised in the ready postion sweeping left and right as he comes down, when he reaches the bottom his muzzle rest in the direction of the man in rags. Hand moving to his ear he activates his comm link. "Ma'am we have humaniod male down here, send Feldon down he might need medical attention." Vor'en looks over at Xander. "Get anything out of him yet?"
As trhe rest of the squad from up Vor'en desides to securing the LZ is needed more then ever. "Ok everyone down the ramp sweep the area, I want comms open at all times. If you see anything detain and call it in, If fired apon do not, I repeat do not heztate to return fire. Move people."

Awne's fur bristles at the human, eyeing him from head to toe. She stayed just behind Vor'en which was probably a good thing when she started to growl softly. She did not like the human, nor his attitude. *Be polite Awne…* she tells herself, surpressing the growling as much as she could.

Dropping his hood, Aymaric shows his short cropped, muddy red hair. He looks haggard and near exhaustion. Dark circles under his eyes and a few cuts on his face are some signs of living harshly for a while, just in case his clothes didn't give that clue. "well, I guess since you have the obvious numerical advantage I wil ltell my side..."

Lt. Baruush: "Copy that Sergeant."
After a few moments, Feldon and Master Lorhas walk down the ramp. The aging Jedi Master stopped next to Lues and handed him his silver lightsaber. Lues nodded to him in respect. Aymaric observed that the older Jedi had piercing brown eyes and confidence of a seasoned Jedi. His skin was of a light-tan complexion. His hair was neatly cut and brown, with a touch of gray beginning to show on the sides. The master stood at about 5'10. He wore a tan Jedi tunic encased by dark brown Jedi robes and dark brown boots. His lightsaber that was clipped to his belt had a dish emitter and was silver with black paneling. The young Jedi stood next to the other two Jedi. There were three Jedi total standing in front of Aymaric. Aymaric noticed that the other Jedi had blue eyes and pale skin with features on his face that made him appear stern. He is wearing a white tunic with a black belt and a lightsaber clipped to it. His boots are brown and the pants were tucked into his footwear. The man seems to have a very helpful and kind aura to him. He stepped forward and bowed to Aymaric.

Lorhas strokes his beard and responds.
Lorhas: "Lues was right, Falsoor does have a presence here, at least they did. Who were those droids working for my friend?"
The Republic squad does a standard sweeping formation of in roughly a 50 meter radius of the ship. They are unable to find anything serious as one of the team leaders report to Sergeant Vor'en.

"Not a problem. As far as weapons I just have this little blaster" Aymaric carefully pulls aside his cloak and slowly pulls a small hold out blaster from under his shirt. "This was all I could manage to get out of the facility with when the droids attacked" then a look and a smile as if remembering something, "ohhh..ya this tiny fella too" Aymaric produces a vibbrodagger from behind his back, also very slowly.

Dismayed by the lack of order on this ship Theos has now lost what little respect he had for this so called New Republic. It was an enbaressment for a veteran soldier to say that no punishment should be given to someone who attacked him endangering the crew and the mission. Jedi are a threat even if you take their weapons away the Feeorin had to wonder how experencied this soldier was or if he was letting his personal feelings get in the way of his judgement. As the so called commanders of this ship seem lacked about the jedi attacking THeos will not let down his guard for the treachous jedi and their tricks he is now watching them closer.
After being told to gatehr Theos leaves the medbay with restraint and gathers his equipment and the field kit as well. As the landing door opens and the werid thing walks out Theos can only wonder why this thing was here as if waiting or he possible could see the battle. Not taking chances he levels his blaster at the thing and primes his weapon.
Theos: "Sarge we have the jedi using the force crap to guide us do we really need another liability on the mission with taking this guy along? I mean the jedi are jumpy and pulling their lightsabers out at us who the heck is this guy and how do we know we can trust him just because he says he can be? For all we know he could be working for falsoor and sent her to leas us amiss. We can't rely on the jedi as we have just seen their powers could be tangled with all the crap that this planet is sending off."

Aymaric estimates the direction they are headed will most certainly lead to the ruined colony. It would possibly lead to some survivors, but it could also be dangerous. It's possible that the way Lues is headed that the colony is on the way towards Mur Eva.

"I will take responceablity for Awne if anything happens like last time she is to be restrened, weapons on stun, Then contact the Lt. for pick up. Do I make myself clear on this?" Vor'en looks at Woro and the other Jedi. "You need to stay close you sence anything let me know." Vor'en knows that Woro will not let him down and will not let anything happen to Awne. "Let's move out people comms open at all times." Vor'en looks at Awne handing her back her lightsaber. "I am trusting you on this. If it happens again I will not hesatate to stun you. If you can get rid of this thing before it happens do so, I am tursting you on this Awne please don't let me down darlin'."

Awne's ears droop, taking her lightsaber sadly and hooking it back to her belt. She didn't know what happened, something did and now even her friends were skeptical on her. She sighs softly, nodding her head as she follows Vor'en. She wouldn't let them down, she'd push the feelings aside like a good Jedi but still...it wasn't her fault...

Sergeant Vor'en gives the order to assume a tactical formation. The group is assembled in seconds. Hadru and Xander move ahead of the actual formation by about 100 meters. Once they have a good distance away, the group steps in a formation similar to a diamond if you were to see them from a bird's eye view. The first team in formation had about 10 meters in between them, as they knew it was unwise to group together for purposes of being hit by explosives or automatic weapons. 10 meters behind the first team was Vor'en and the Jedi. The Jedi were grouped together, but Vor'en avoided bunching up despite the less than tactical Jedi. Vor'en marched along with Awne, preparing his mind for the long walk. The rain was making a tapping sound on top of his Republic issue helmet as he tried to focus his thoughts for the mission. 10 meters behind the command element was 2nd team, bringing up the rear of the formation.
Vor'en heard a crackle in his helmet from the Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Baruush: "Sergeant, you have forty-eight hours from now to complete the mission. You have about six hours before nightfall. Comm check me every thirty-minutes. Send any updates as needed. I will try to repair the ship, and if I encounter any danger I'll take off. Be sure to comm if you need quad-gun support with your coordinates."
Lues speaks to Vor'en as well.
Lues: "Hey Vor, I estimate we've got a good walk ahead...we might need to take frequent breaks. We'll most likely be traversing some cliffs."
The formation marched through the damp sand of Vjun. Xander and Hadru could see mountains and crags in the direction they were walking. They were headed straight for a long two days.

Aymaric's few years as a Republic Soldier told him he would not get anyone to listen to him. After all, to them he was just some corporate flunkie who's current sole purpose in life was to disinform and lead astray there group. The information he did have about the local weather was probably already known by these well equipped people and having him continue to tell them they should put on there galoshes like he was their mother was probably getting on their nerves. He did however have a little bit of information they might not know..with a slight jog through the wet sand, Aymaric catches up to Sergeant Vor'en and lets him know.. "The colony of First Hope is in the direction you are heading. That's also where the Hssiss attacked and the Droids shortly there after. Just figured I could give you some useful information." Then, just as he showed up next to Vor'en, he left. Moving to the back of the formation.

Feldon nods to Vor'en and Awne, overhearing the conversation from where he is walking.

When we get finished with the mission I will definitely look into more to get to the bottom of this mystery. Awne is a padawan wrought with emotion but I believe this was out of her control. I've come to trust her more than any other being I know and she wouldn't do this on her free will. Although I'm sure the soldiers doubt our motives, they must trust our judgment to know that we will get to the heart of this matter and not jeopardize their mission."
The Jedi Knight Lues responds to Vor'en.
Lues: "All I know is that there is some hostile life forms out there, difficult to sense but they are there. I think they have large numbers. We'll have to use our smaller numbers to our advantage by moving quick and stealthily. Unfortunately this place is heavy in the presence of the dark side, I have a hard time pinpointing anything.

Theos scans the area well. He tries to look through the rain and can see nothing but sand and dunes to stretch out for a good kilometer. You seemed to be surrounded by brownish/red mountains and crags. You can't see any life forms other than your own companions. Nothing seemed suspicious.

As for Awne, Woro was troubled by what had transpired earlier, but he continued to trust her completely--she was a bit emotional at times, but was a true a trusted friend. He knew one thing, though--he was not a fan of this stinging rain. Just as he was beginning to form a complaint about it, he heard the farghul state she sensed something approaching the Team.

'Unsettling this place is...' Hadru says to Xander 'We haven't spoke since your infliction, glad to see your better, I bet you didn't think you be on a planet raining acid after you just recovered from the chills.' Hadru smiles and can't help but chuckle at the situation.
Hadru adjusted his goggles making sure his eyes were protected, and tightened his all temperature cloak protecting his skin and face. Hadru felt the most comfortable outside, each step he took was carefully picked his senses were attuned to the planet, and he scanned his surrounding often, focusing his attention to reconnaissance even with the distraction of the harsh climate and rough terrain.
Hadru continues to Xander
'I think the human we met was sincere, and I believe there are survivors from the colony stranded. I'm puzzled through to why they were attacked, and by whom. This isn't the most hospitable of planets. I wonder what Falsoor was doing out here to draw enough attention to get there colony destroyed. Keep an eye out for tracks, I don't want any surprises.'

Kardoon went over the circuitry bay in the main corridor and observed the extent of the damage. It was obvious the ship had been in a battle. Kardoon started working with the burned out wires and attempted to reroute power to the sensors. He had to open the maintenance panel and crawl into the innards of the ship to do this. After about an hour of tinkering with the power, wires, and sensor connections...Kardoon made minimal progress. He walked over to the cockpit and noticed they were still down. As a matter of fact, he had made them worse off than before. It might require more work than what he thought.

Sergeant Vor'en comes over the loudspeaker and everyone is advised to secure themselves in their crash webbing. This is executed in anticipation of take-off after a 2 hour and 15 minute delay. The entire *Starshade* rumbles as the ship takes-off. It was possibly nauseating to some who were onboard.
Vor'en eases the ship into the air and begins his flight path back somewhere near the original LZ. He remains conscious of the turbolaser towers and attempts to fly around the 9 kilometer radius they threatened. He wasn't even sure if they'd target him, but he wanted to be safe just in case. Kardoon sits in the co-pilot's seat and advises Vor constantly.
Kardoon: "Set heading at 371...should be there in 15 seconds. Looks like a decent landing spot."
Vor'en is aware they had to adjust out of the turbolasers range now. So this LZ was not the same one they had used earlier. This one seemed to be the bottom of a ravine but it was the closest one out of the turret radius. He eased the *Starshade* down into the ravine and completed the landing cycle without a hitch. However, the *Starshade* was sitting at somewhat of an angle. Sergeant Vor'en opens the boarding ramp and nods his head to the chiss.
Back in the main hold, Drayden spoke out in annoyance. He slammed his fist down on the dejarik table.

Sergeant Vor'en once again came over the loudspeaker and told everyone to prepare for launch. Within seconds, the *Starshade* lifted off and headed into orbit. The ship rumbled immensely as the engines propelled the freighter. After a few minutes of annoying turbulence...the ship went dead quiet. The pilot used minute thruster bursts to slow the ship enough so it wouldn't drift too much. Once the ship slowed down enough, they took a holding pattern in orbit.
The sergeant looked through the transparisteel framework at Vjun. It was a giant sphere of tan, red, and brown coloring. Indeed, it was preferable to look at it afar than it was to be on it. The calming aura of space began to sink in after everything settled.
If he was to spot anything out here it would be solely on visual scanning, as the sensors were shot. So they would have to await patiently until receiving positive confirmation from Kardoon.
The sergeant sat there for about two minutes and heard his transceiver come to life. It was time for the usual half-hour comm check.

Corlen? the wookiee thought as he head the two Jedi approaching. That was a name he had not heard before. Initially, he pretended to not hear their conversation.
"I think we need to talk about alot of things, unfortunately. I would like to be filled in more about the Sith we just met. The picture of Lorhas on the wall clearly means something important. Do either of you know of anyone close to Lorhas or to Mur Eva who might now be Sith?" Woro was rolling now, and did not give time for either to answer before beginning his next line of questioning. "And why is he after Awne? Is it because she is the most powerful of any of us in the Force? Could he be behind her episodes? And Mur Eva...it didn't appear that he wanted her dead, as he had every opportunity to easily dispatch her." Switching topics again, he asked about the holocron that nearly got Gor killed. "What is its purpose?"
Toward the end of his questioning, Woro decided to put it all on the table matter-of-factly, "And who is Corlen? After everything we have went through the last few days, I think we deserve the full story about everything, please."
After this rapid fire questioning, the wookiee realized how exhausted he was, both physically and emotionally. He flopped into a nearby seat, waiting on a response. He was not sure what was going to happen next, but was pleased to have finally gotten his questions out that had been bothering for a long time.

**Cockpit**
Sergeant Vor'en continued to listen to the transceiver when something went awry. The transceiver began to crackle,fizzle, and spark. Then a loud pop occurred and the communications panel began smoking. It seemed that the communications had been jury-rigged by Lance but hadn't been fully repaired. Lance wasn't exactly the most sound technician. Vor'en tried to send out a communication to the Dark Steed, but to no avail. The battle with the Z-95's had been more costly than originally thought.

Awne sighs happily as she steps from the shower, wrapping a towel around her as she hums happily. It was so much nicer being clean and feeling so much better after a nice shower. Gathering up her clothes she frowns, why didn't she have the foresight to pack another pair of clothing?
A sigh escapes her as she dresses again and steps from the refresher with a towel running through her hair, oh well, this felt good anyway.

Feldon nodded to the padawan out of respect.
Feldon Azrik: "You've been paying attention... Very good. As it so happens, we've been discussing similar things since we have gotten on the ship. I can tell you that this Sith Lord's appearance is near unbelievable. The Sith teachings should have died with Emperor Palpatine, but obviously it has not. We don't know why he would want Mur Eva or Awne...but it's likely to do with him training them in the Dark Side of the Force. He might want to teach them the ways of the Sith. Awne and Mur Eva have both demonstrated tremendous potential. Could these two cases be related somehow? And I know...we don't really talk about the Sith much during these times. They are very rare. That leads me to believe that meeting this Sith is a part of our destiny."
The Jedi Knight looks at Lues and turns about. He then then turns back around to Woroken and addresses him.
Feldon: "I know nothing about the holocron. But it's possible its the source of where he gained his knowledge of the Sith. Right now, that could be the only assumption I could make based on what I know. There shouldn't be anyone left to pass on their beliefs. The Sith are 10 times more rare than the Jedi Order...and even we are small in numbers."
Lues waits until Feldon is finished and speaks up.
Lues Van: "As far as Corlen Doris goes, he was a Jedi Master who trained me and Lorhas. I can't remember much about him due to my amnesia....but Lorhas knew him very well. Feldon would like to speak to him the next possible chance we get....he seems to be an obvious suspect. We haven't seen him since he resigned to Falsoor as the headmaster of the Telares Station. I assume you can put two and two together...that he was a trained Jedi that ended up working for the Falsoor organization."
Feldon Azrik: "Yes...you can. You must also realize the tremendous importance we've undertaken. We have to report to the Praxeum by secure means as soon as possible."

Kaz'jee woke up and looks around from the common room area and had followed Awne to wait for her to get out of her bath. He had followed her but arrived as she had closed the door...which was alright with him. He had no desire to see her form at the current moment, and was quite content to just wait outside. At seeing her emerge, his face was aglow, as much as it could be through the fur, with happiness and he quickly ran to hug her and then look around once more "We safe now...yes? Helped find friend...help...Kaz'jee home?" The Ewok didnt necassarily wish to return home...he had grown rather accustomed to this small band of closely nit individuals he has come to know as friends.

Woro nodded at the explanation given by the Jedi. It seemed to make sense to him, and he appreciated being kept "in the loop" so to speak. The strangest thing to him was that a Jedi was working for Falsoor. "Sounds like speaking to Corlen would be a good place to start.

The blonde Jedi nodded to the wookiee and spoke with resolve.
Feldon: "Certainly. Although I believe there's no telling where we will find ourselves after we go over all of this information. However, we all need to step our selves out of the situations we dealt with on Vjun and take a logical look at the events that unfolded. I suggest you meditate...but I'm sure you know what to do anyways. Could you make sure you check on Awne and see how she is interpreting this? It's no hurry...just like to see what you can do."
Woroken and the two Jedi Knights finish their conversation, they head elsewhere in the ship. It was obvious to Woroken that the two Knights had nothing to hide from Woroken. It was possible he was even getting more trust than his peer, Awne. The wookiee was usually not the subject of Jedi meetings. Padawans were typically told what to do and why they did what they did, but it was as if they were seeking Woro's input. This was especially rare from Lues.
Roughly four hours pass on the *Starshade.* Everyone seemed to be doing their own business and having small talk. The atmosphere of the ship was quiet and withdrawn. Drayden seemed to be getting unhappy as they waited on the freighter indefinitely.

The gruff security chief tapped Vor'en on the back who apparently had a lot on his mind. The veteran was enjoying a cold alcoholic beverage in the cockpit staring at Vjun.

**Main Hold**
Woroken was in the spacious main hold. He was occupying the corner opposite of the dejarik table in which Liza seemed to be occupying. She was silently typing things into her datapad.
The mini-cantina was a quaint part of the ship. It had a bar table with a blue illumination panel overhead. It generated a night life kind of feel in just that little area. If you stepped in that area you almost felt as if you were somewhere else. Behind the bar table, was the shelves full of bottles. The corner itself had a small cryo-storage unit to keep drinks cold. The unit would open up and it stretched back to hold a lot of alcohol.
Overall, the mini-cantina complemented the main hold well and was there to keep morale up. It was apparent that Ordenn, the former owner of the ship, knew how to have a good time.
Drayden walked up to Woro and started rummaging through the bar.
Drayden: "I'd like a Sith shockwave. Hmm...but not the full-strength kind. What are you getting? I didn't know Jedi even drank."

Waking up from another bad dream, Aymaric checks his watch and notices another hour has passed. He also checks his recently applied bandage and notices that it is still bleeding. Setting his equipment up again, he decides he will use a med pack this time, the synth flesh didn't seem to be enough on the last go around.
The pain from the two procedures and the deeper pain from his recent personal losses, drives the once naive and childish man to look for a way to dull the pain. First though, he felt a need to do his duty, and so he set about refilling his med kit, restoking what he had lost on Vijun. He fought the urge to use the painkillers in the med cabinet to dull his internal and external suffering. Instead he decided to focus on the task at hand and to get to the refresher with a change of clothes.
A shower and a clean change of clothes, his spare Falsoor uniform, seemed to wash away the memories of Vijun and cover up the pain he felt from those memories. The pain from his wounds was still very real, but the clean smelling clothes and his fresh smelling body made the man forget everything that happened over the last few days. Even when he gathered up the bloody and hole ridden republic uniform, he didn't feel anything. It all seemed like some far off dream.
One thing would have given an indication to anyone paying very close attention that something was still not right with the medic from Coruscant. While he went through every pocket on the uniform that belonged to Theos, looking for personal belongings, he very obviously avoided one Large pocket. The pocket holding the braclet of his once loving girlfriend, was never searched. The braclet was still in the pocket of the Republic uniform, that had once belonged to Theos the Feeorin and had the blood of Qwy the Selkath splattered all over it.
At the sound of all clear, Aymaric pushes the button which closes the airlock he used to jettison trash he found in the med bay along with the destroyed uniform, never looking back.

Sergeant Vor'en, after awaiting a good hour with no sort of confirmation from Kardoon, starts to walk about the ship to inform people of upcoming hyperspace travel. Once he makes his rounds he goes back into the cockpit and sits down to perform his astrogation duties. He types in a few commands to bring up the route somewhere between Bandomeer and Mandalore. That was the last place the *Dark Stallion* was located. It had stopped there for the next rendezvous with the *Starshade*.
After about roughly a minute the route to the Stallion is cleared and he pulls back on the hyperspace throttle control. The stars transform into star lines and the freighter blinks into hyperspace.
The welcoming view of the blue luminary wormhole fills the cockpit. Vor'en tries not to stare too hard and goes over the navicomputer information. It seemed it would be two days before they arrived at the **Dark Stallion.**

Vor'en watches the wormhole go by. He was glad that he was safely away from that lump of rock floating in space. If he had his way he would have it blown from the stars, but that would not happen. He had lost friends there. Like any battle field he had fought on before it was one place that would be marked with deaths that would haunt him in his sleep. Master Lorhas was a good friend that must have saw something in him that few did, most saw him as just what he was an old soldier. Some feared him, some just looked the other way. He didn't care really. Most of the people on this ship where the closest thing he had to a family. Mostly Jedi, Awne, Woro, Feldon, and Lues that where all that is left of it. He would miss the ones that one died before.
Times like these he wondered how his mother handled the riggers of command. She was a Captain of a Star Destroyer under Thrawn. She ruled his life like she commanded her ship. With an iron fist. That was mostly why he became a Storm Trooper over being in the Imperial Navy or what was left of it at that time. Funny how he wound up working for the people that he had been told most of his life where the enemy. He had joined the Army and she turned her back on him. Said he was just like his father, whatever that ment. He had never met his father and if he was just like him then he wanted to meet the man. He was probably dead by now. Ultimately it didn't matter to him. He had lived through another mission and saved as many lives as he could. He raised his glass to all of ones that never made it back. He saw them every time he closed his eyes, asking him why he could not save them and he had no answer for them.

Walking through the ships corridors, Aymaric makes his way to the cantina. He has no real idea what he plans on doing there, but he does plan on getting something to drink.
Without a word to anyone in the room, Aymaric steps to the cabinet holding all the liquor. Removing a glass and the first bottle he sees, he pours himself a taste, sips it, swishes it in his mouth and mutters, "Too sweet." He continues this process through all but the next to last bottle (I don't know how many would be in this place.). This one puts a tiny smile on his face, which follows a wince that indicates the liquid is very strong. "Bitter, strong and horrible to taste." Looking at the bottle he noticed only half a worn label that appeared unreadable. "smells awful too." Taking the glass, bottle and a ready to eat meal from the cupboard, he sits down and pours himself a full glass. "So where's that blue guy?"

She pets the Ewoks head before frowning where to go first, see if the arm could be reattached now that the skin was healthy and regrown or go and make sure the sarge was alright and not beating himself up. She decided she could probably do both.

He needed to give her the remnants of her lightsaber that he had grabbed back on Vjun, and wanted to talk to her about her experience with the Sith.

The Jedi goes over to one of the pristine white bins and pulls out a datapad.
Feldon: "I've been keeping a journal on her condition and I've seen similar cases of her odd behavior up to 8 years ago. She used to suffer partial amnesia...which was the case on Vjun. She has been known to unleash vicious attacks but can't seem to genuinely disseminate friend from foe. I don't think this is negligence or hostility, due to the fact I can sense the truth from her. Have you been paying attention to her? Because I need an opinion from a medical professional that does not use the Force. Some of us in the group had even wanted Awne restrained for her lack of control. But I don't think Awne is herself, so to speak, when these episodes happen."

Looking at Feldon with concentration on his face, Aymaric sets his bottle of liquor and helmet down on a nearby table before taking a seat on a just as nearby stool. " I have noticed some unusual behaviors, but I am not an expert on Jedi and their quirks." Putting his elbow on the table and resting his hand on the bottle, he continues. "If you've known about her behavior for eight years, why wait until now? It could be an issue that might have been taken care of sooner." Taking the bottle and removing the cap, he continues. "Kind of pointless to dwell I guess." Taking a sip from the bottle, he again continues. "If I didn't know better, and I'm sure I don't, I'd say she's a totally different species altered to look like a Farghul." Holding his hand up to stop any immediate protest, the medic pauses a moment to think. "The reason I say this is, you said earlier today that you have never heard of spontaneous regeneration of limbs by force users. I know Farghuls are not limb regenerators. Also, her blackouts and aggressive behavior towards companions could be a sign of a repressed personality. Now all of this is conjecture and unsupported, slightly educated guesses. The only way to know for sure about any of this is to run extensive tests that require much more machinery and education than I have here. The best I can do is very basic physical scans and some first term Psycho tests." With nothing more to offer, he takes a larger swig from the bottle and waits for Feldon's reply. "I'm sorry for your loss of Lorhas."

**Medical Bay**
The Jedi lays down his datapad and finishes the checkup of the MedScan.
Feldon: "Well, the problem is that Awne shows no evident physical issues. Back then her amnesia was mild but there was nothing to show of it in her body. In fact, all signs said she was perfectly healthy. Essentially, there has been nothing we can do to help her as of yet because it seems as if nothing was wrong. Surely she isn't just staging this as an act or something? The only thing I could do was document the incident and be prepared if something else did happen. And now, 8 years later, something odd has occurred again. She only recently has went on episodes and attacked some crew members at the beginning of the mission. That's why we are going to do things by the numbers now."
Feldon: "But uh, that's an interesting theory. A different species altogether? With what I've seen I'd be willing to believe anything. Tell me more if you can. And when do you want to do those tests? Because I was going to check on her arm first...even though I know it's healing well. I figured we'd check on her arm and then go from there. You'll have to forgive me, a lot of my medical knowledge is augmented by the Force. However, this could be an interesting mix of work styles."
Just then, the ewok and the farghul strolled into the room. They were oblivious to the conversation Aymaric and Feldon just had. The Jedi Knight looked over to Aymaric for advice.

Awne offers a faintly smile to the Ewok as they move down the hallway "this way, my masterr's called forr me forr a check up." She sighs, she hated the med bay with a passion, always had, at least now it meant a bit of rest and a look to hopefully get her arm back on.
She points with her tail to the med bay as the move into it, since her hand was occupied by the Ewoks fuzzy one, her tail waves to the others, seemed it was happily made for being a second or third working appendage if needed.
She offers a nod to the doctor then a weak smile to her master, she felt as though she let him down. They hadn't saved mur, they lost Master Lorhas, and she lost her arm and a duel.
The smile fades as she berates herself mentally, she could almost see that kind smile that her father gave her when she would fail the first time, tell her that it was alright and she could try again next time; she knew better, he was disappointed in her...it wasn't a shock after a year for him to find her continuing to practice for days on end to exhaustion until she got it right.
Oh he may have told her he wasn't disappointed but then fathers are supposed to, she knew that he thought she could be better she knew that! She was special she want to have any of those limitations that humans had or the other students! she was better and she could do anything her father taught her..just...not always the first time around.
She shakes her head to shake the black thoughts and memories to focus on her Master and the doctor "you called forr me Masterr?"

Feldon sees that he isn't getting a definite answer from Aymaric so he has Awne lay down on the medical bed in the back. The bed wasn't very comfortable and essentially it was a thin slab with thick padding over it. It was designed so it wouldn't move around in space flight and hurt patients further.
Feldon turned on the MedScan and began sweeping the farghul's body with its sensor. Once the check is done and ten minutes have passed, the Jedi analyzes the results.
Feldon: "Amazing...your arm is undergoing complete cellular reconstruction. It's even regrowing over cauterization, which is not normal at all.At this rate, you'll have a new arm in 26 hours. So I guess reattaching your old arm would only make it worse. I would advise you leave it as it is."
He then frowns at the other half of the results.
Feldon: "But it appears you have no mind disturbances. So your odd behavior couldn't be linked to any brain trauma. To anybody else, this would suggest that you are normal in controlling your actions. But, we've all seen differently. By technical terms, you'd either have to be deemed insane or you should be held accountable for your actions. And I swear by the Force, that you didn't have control of yourself...Lorhas felt this way too. And if the other members of the group hear about this, they may want Awne restrained and brought to justice. Aymaric? Do you mind? "
The Jedi motioned for his appraisal of the situation. Indeed, it was hard to see if Awne had any medical justification for her actions. Though the Jedi seemed adamant to believe that it wasn't her fault.

Not finding Awne in his area, Woro decided he would go peek in on Vor. He hadn't had much of an opportunity to visit with the old soldier during the planning and the Vjun expedition. Even though Vor had never picked up the ability to understand Woro, he still felt a kinship for the human.
He headed toward the cockpit, seeing Vor by himself. He squeezed into the cockpit and took the copilot's chair, nodding at Voren. One look told the wookiee that Vor might be feeling worse than even he was. The mission ended up a disaster, but it was not Vor's fault. Who in their right mind could have predicted a Sith Master there? He knew the human was no doubt beating himself up nonetheless. Woro patted his friend on the shoulder and just sat quietly, stifling a cough from breathing those god awful cigars of Vor's.

Awne lays uncomfortably as still as she could stand, she had been hoping for something comfortable but...well...she sighs as she's scaned, her tail flicking slowly in a lazy fashion mostly to her bored feelings. The time passes in quiet agony, wanting to know the results of the scan.
As her master goes over the information her mind shut down at one part "At this rate, you'll have a new arm in 26 hours." Her eyes were wide and mouth open, she...she was actually regenerating an arm?!? She knew he was talking to someone else but it was all lost to her, a new arm? would it be like her other? was it going to hurt? what if something went wrong?
Then panic set in as she started to sit up "I don't want to stay in a med bay!!" she exclaims loudly, pleading with her master to save her from the white walls and noise of a med bay. Of all the things in life that she hated, the med bay and staying in it for longer than needed was a large one.

"Sorry about Master Lorhas, Woro. He was a good man and a good friend." Vor'en looks back out the view port. "I was saying good bye to them in my own way. Even though there I will see there faces when I close my eyes. Which is why I don't sleep much. I have lost to my people close to me. You, Feldon, Lues and Awne are all I have left of the old team. At least we know Mur is still out there somewhere. Poor kid." With that he gets really quite. He was not used to telling people who he felt.

"Ya sure, but I don't think I need to do it in here. Actually, We could just give her a questionaire to start with and go from there." Watching the Farghul react to the confined space of the med bay gave Aymaric very little indication of Awne's true psychological issues. Her fear of a small space is common among most species, especially ones that evolved on open spaces like Awne's planet. Pondering to himself, Aymaric speaks outloud. "She did specifically say 'med bay' when she mentioned she was scared of being here didn't she?" Focusing on Feldon this time. "Do you know if she has ever spent a long period of time in a hospital? That could help quite a bit." Grabbing his data pad he punches in some information the looks at Feldon again. "My expertise in medicine deals more with the physical aspects of pain than it does with the mental, but I'll send this questionaire to you and see what I can do for her. It includes some really simple, almost childish questions and mental acuity tests. Do you Twitter?"

Looking up to Awne he purrs reassuringly before looking back to the Doctor-man. "How long is hour? Umm...How long is twenty-six hour....? Sound like....maybe be many moon before arm comes back..." He suddenly remembers that he has that red crystal. He takes it out of the pack, still keeping it hidden from the Farghul. What did he do with it now...?

A groan escapes her lips and frowns "at least it's an open arrea.." she says half to herself and half to the Ewok, she smiles and nudges him "why don't you go get some rrest huh? I think maybe I should go see Aym, alone."

Leaning back in his 'chair', he pulls out his data pad and starts to hand it to the one armed Farghul, making it only half way. He pulls the pad back and tosses it on the crate next to him. "I don't think that would be of any use to us, although they are a bit of fun when you're killing time." Relaxing even further in his 'chair', Aymaric takes a hold of his liquor bottle and rests it on his knee, letting rest there without opening it. "I think what Feldon really wants from this is for you to confide in someone you have no real relationship with. Someone like me who has no reason to judge you and no way of feeling the truth from you." Setting the bottle on the floor next to him, he leans forward and speaks in a sincere tone.

Woro figured what Vor'en needed more than anything right now was someone to talk to. This quick bite he just told the wookiee was more emotion than anyone of the group, except maybe Awne, had gotten from the soldier. Their communication barrier wouldn't be a problem as Woro could definitely listen to Vor. He pulled out his own bottle brought from the cantina, and seeing Vor already had one of his own, wordlessly raised it for a toast to remember his friends yet again. It was just a small gesture, but the wookie thought it might have made him feel a bit better.

Woro finished his beverage, then reached into his backpack and pulled out Awne's broken lightsaber and showed it to Vor. That single piece of equipment seemed to be a perfect analogy for the mission they had spent the last several days undergoing. The team ended up just as broken as the weapon.
The wookiee had always been keen on keeping little trinkets that reminded him of memories worth keeping, both good and bad. That was the reason he still lugged around the spear that has father gave him many years ago. He didn't need it per se, it just made him feel comfortable knowing it was there. In the same vein, he wished he had an item of Lorhas, almost a second father, to keep.

She sighs and leans back in her hammock, her tail flicking along her leg and the Ewok's arm that rested with her, cute little bugger that one, wouldn't even leave her side.
She frowns again at the humans words, was that what this was about? "I hate med bays...they make you lay still for hourrs orr days on end, therre's nothing to do, it all smells too clean, it's too dull in colorr, therre's neverr any windows looking out to something good, the one's in orrbit orr being flown just have space..I mean if it was out to something with trrees it might be betterr..orr if therre werre plants but therre arren't! therre neverr arre!" she was getting animated now with her good arm, looking to the human then at the ceiling as she complained to someone all the things she held in about the damn med bays.
"I mean when I was sick and my fatherr had to take carre of me at least the bed was comforrtable! and the view had the forrest and I could still hearr the trraining in the dojo and I could sneak out to watch! grranted he'd find me and tell me to go back, but that's beside the point."
She sighs and looks to her hands at the thought of home and her father, she missed it, wondered what he was doing, was he still training or had he finally retired? like he would retire.
Her tail flicks faintly "I just hate med bays...they arren't..warrm." she looks over to the human then "You know? they arren't welcoming."

The large wookiee nodded once more at his friend, stood up and squeezed out of the cockpit. ""Hang in there, pal," he said, patting Vor's back again, knowing the pilot would have no idea what was said. He knew the tenor of the gesture would shine through.
He turned and went to look for Awne, almost suddenly realizing how tired he was. Between meeting the Jedi, and spending some time with Vor, he hadn't had an opportunity to rest since boarding the ship.
He walked through the hallways of the ship looking for his Farghul friend to no avail. "She must be busy," he thought, again stowing the busted saber, "it'll keep."
Headed to one of the empty rooms, so he could meditate and take a quick nap. After a bit of initial problem, he quickly found his center and relaxed, allowing the Force to take over him, as Master Lorhas taught him so long ago.

Without opening his eyes in the slightest, he felt the burning presence of Lues enter the cargo bay. He did not hear him walk through the hissing door or hear his footfalls, rather the Force was communicating to him. The Jedi Knight seemed to have something on his mind, but was going to see if the padawan felt like exiting his meditation. Traditionally, Jedi did not like to interrupt anyone's meditation.

"I hadn't even thought about the 'why' of Lorhas going back to hold off the Sith. Maybe he realized Mur Eva had exhausted her strength and had given all she had."
He paused slightly before quietly saying, "And maybe Lorhas had some connection to the Sith, with his picture being in the hall and all, and he thought it was something he had to take care of himself. Or maybe Lorhas decided he wasn't going to let Mur Eva be taken again." He shrugged. There was so much they didn't know about the Sith, and about Lorhas's decision.
"As for the performance of the Team, well, we are always pretty unorganized. Vor tries, but there are several strong personalities in our group. And a few of the team have only been with us a few days. And I have to admit, I was stunned at seeing a Sith." He sounded embarrassed when admitting his failure during the battle.
"I won't be surprised when we see him the next time. I just wish I hadn't listened to Lorhas and had helped him against the Sith. Both of us might have changed things."

Woro shook his head sadly before saying, "Leus you know how much Lorhas loved Mur Eva. He would have given his life for her, or for Feldon, you or I, for that matter. He would have sacrificed himself for any or all of us," he reiterated. "And you know," just realizing something, "Lorhas might have sensed the same thing in Awne that the Sith did, and wanted to make sure we had time to get her out of there, and out of Strife's hands. It could have even been Gor, who's also strong in the Force, though he's had no training." Woro continued shaking his head and softly responded, "I just wish we had a chance to talk to Lorhas to figure out exactly what he was thinking." He snorted as he softly laughed a bit, "Lorhas would have known exactly what to do in this situation, you know..." beofre his voice trailed off.

"Well I would say without the Sithlord there the droids will be leaderless, so they won't be organized as much as they where, so that will help out. I would also stay away from the wild people roaming around as well. They just attack until you are dead or out of there site."

After a long and refreshing rest, Gor felt himself slipping back into consciousness. He felt much better, like all the things in his body that had been broken before had been put back into place. All the felt rubbing of on him now was the normal weariness after sleeping for too long.

**Aft Cargo Bay**
The bothan sat on the grated floor deep in meditation. He was clearing his thoughts and focusing his mental energy within to reach a clear sense of thought. As if by a miracle, he felt his spirit rising slowly from his body as he concentrated hard.
All at once, he felt the living energy of the galaxy pour into his soul and it was infinitely refreshing to him. As if enlightened by the Force itself, he felt his being close to Mur Eva.
She was alive and well, laying down in a ray-shielded cell. The cell was dark and he couldn't see much of the details.
Suddenly, from the haziness of this image, a large red beast with snarling jaws roared at Gor Ak's presence.
The bothan was snapped out of his meditation and flung the length of the cargo bay into some storage crates. The plasteel crates fell onto of him as a result of the impact. It made considerable noise in the cargo hold.

Woro: "It was a bad turn of events out there for sure. Vor'en has lead us through alot of tough missions before, and like I said, its tough keeping up with us. I know that I get scatterbrained at times when things get hectic." It embarrassed Woro to admit his shortcomings, as his still had a great deal of his wookiee pride concerning battle.
"I agree about Gor. I was thinking the same thing. I know you felt him through the Force back there...he has a lot of power. We need to help him understand it and reign it in. He seems to be of pretty good character, and he seems to have a bit of an innate ability to lead. The others already respect him a great deal, it seems. I would be happy to talk to him with you and Feldon." The wookiee, despite the recent tragedy, felt a twinge of pride in that Leus was treating him almost as an equal.

*What the…?*
Shaking his head to make it stop ringing, the Bothan pushed away some of the crates and stood up. He took a moment to think about what had just happended. He had used meditation a lot to keep himself calm and focus his mind, but THAT had never happended before. He didn´t like it. ever since they arrived at this accursed planet, weird things had been happening, and he didn´t like weird things, at least not if he didn´t understand why they happended. He really should talk to one of the Jedi about it...unfortunately, the most sensible of them was no longer available. Maybe he would talk to Feldon or Woro, since they would have taken up that role now, at least in his opinion.
But first things first. That was Mur Eva he had seen, and she had seemed quite alive, although a prisoner. Question was, what would he do with this information, if it was even accurate? If the gave even the slightest hint that she could be alive, he was sure the others - or if no one else, Awne - would insist that they go after her. and that in turn would jeopardize them ever being able to report back what they had found to higher authorities. While trying to decide, his mind drifted to the weird creature he had seen...he was sure he had seen something like it before somewhere...or was he mistaken?

The bothan tried to logically deduct what he had just seen in his meditation. It was similar to a nightmare and hard to completely understand. The beast he saw, with horns that protruded near the mouth, was unlike he anything he had ever seen. It had crimson skin and was bipedal.
Furthermore, the bothan wasn't sure what exactly had happened. Never has he seen a vision so vivid or lifelike in his meditation sessions. It would not be unbelievable to say that the hardened warrior would be afraid at the events that just unfolded. Especially because the creature appeared to have been right in front of him. The bothan might also believe he had been accidentally breathing in excess exhaust fumes from the engines while he was meditating. The experience was similar to the hallucination he had felt in the throne room.

The *Starshade* traveled for two days in hyperspace towards its destination. The journey was fairly uneventful except the crew of the ship going over the recent events that occurred on Vjun. A lot of people used the time to catch up on some much needed sleep. Some equipment maintenance was done along with routine checks on the ship systems. Overall, it was a pleasant yet somewhat stale respite to the intense mission.
The freighter stops from hyperspace as the wormhole fades into the familiar star-lit background of space. Vor'en noticed through the viewport that there was nothing in visual proximity except the frigate, the *Dark Stallion*.
![800px-NebBengines_btm.jpg](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/thumb/7/73/NebBengines_btm.jpg/800px-NebBengines_btm.jpg)
The freighter had to close a good 5 kilometers before it got within short-range comlink vicinity. The two ships transferred radio protocols and the *Starshade* was cleared to dock in hangar bay 7. Sergeant Vor'en eased the ship in slowly as the light from the massive hangar bay gushed into the cockpit. He made minute adjustments to avoid the various ships in dock such as the A,E,K,XJ, and X wings. He sat the ship down next to a *Katarn*-class shuttle near the back corner of the gigantic hangar bay. Once they were safely on deck, the Sergeant activated the loading ramp.
The motley crew that was forged in fire from Vjun stepped on top of the hangar floor from the docking ramp. The huge hangar of gray overtones was alive with technicians and personnel bustling about. They all seemed to be doing something with the various shuttles and fighters. The massive holding area peered into the openness of space via the docking entrance. You hear an omniscient voice of a hangar commander giving routine instructions via the loudspeaker, his voice echoes life upon the busy zone.
The group takes in the change of scenery when suddenly two humans in Republic military uniforms approached the group. The pristine white clothing and shining black boots were symbolic of pure goodness. Some might hold the clean uniforms in disdain compared to the team's clothing which had Vjun sand caked in it.
The tan skinned and black haired human approached Vor'en. He knew him as Sergeant First Class Jakin Seres. He was his platoon sergeant. He had no real combat experience but he was an excellent leader by the records. The young Sergeant had beaten Vor'en out for promotion by his by-the-number's attitude. The man stopped next to Vor'en and waited.
Sergeant Seres: "Casualty Report Sergeant!"

Vor'en looks at the two men who did not have a speck of dirt on them.Nothing out of place. " Lost 3 of my command. The LT is dead, Master Lorhas as well. The rest of us are beaten pretty badly. We have the information we where after, we couldn't retrive the other target. Couple of Civilians that need transport and aid to get theere people out of that place. The rest I will tell you later. I need to see to my men now." Vor'en moves past the the two men not really caring what else they wanted. "Red Team report to med bay and then grab a clean uniform and some chow. Dimisses." He walks to his quarters on the ship to check over his remaining weapon and clean up.

damn, forgot about the damn callsign natirash thinks to himself " Roger that Dark Actual, Just wanted to give you a quick rundown of whats happening here while I'm on board. Had an engagment with some of the local wildlife Red Bacta and Knight I are both KIA. I'm also having some issues with Red Wing, and Knight II, they both assualted me after the first engagement, and Red Wing tried to take command saying I was unfit for duty." The Lieutenant fills the Major in on what happened after the first engagement, aymaric calling in air support, kayli trying to take command, and Awne for assaulting him after he tried to put down the creature that ultimately killed her friends.
