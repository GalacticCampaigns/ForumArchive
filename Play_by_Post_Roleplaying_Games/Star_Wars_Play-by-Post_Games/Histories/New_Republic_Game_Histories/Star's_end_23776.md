# Star's end

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-04 01:53:36)

Galactic turmoil, the dead rising, the skies of every planet turning black, sure, that describes the end of the world, and for the passed few years, that's how it has been. Relative calm has taken a foot hold in the galaxy.
((To the players-))
You find yourself on the planet of "Eargo's losing streak." The history of the planet is fairly simplistic. A card shark, running with bad luck, finally ended in a sabac game. Turn's out he won a planet. The planet is a rock, not alot of water, not a lot of vegetation. But, a planet none the less. Besides the obvious downsides, its on the outter rim, oh boy! Turns out the planet has become a bit of a shadow port, though with the Republic, literally rebuilding their entire civilization, shadow ports are as obvious if not localized every day things. Scum and Villiany has turned into "Honey lets go there, I hear we can buy real rodian there!"
A sat state of affairs for sure. The free traders blossom, crime's up, ship raiding is up. Life on the rim, running normal. Besides things going out the arilock for some folks, life's normal. Oh, one side note, the Chiss, have decided to move out of the unknown regions.
Which leads us to you, the players, the heroes of this new day and time.
Most of you find yourself in the same general area. A space port, go figure, however you got here doesn't matter why you're here does.
For the jedi, well, it's quite simple. The chiss are on the move, go play diplomat. But stick to your mission.
For the chiss officer, a warring family that is small, and rather tiny, your family, heh, is suspicious of the assendancy's interest in new republic space. Keeping a low profile is damn near impossible, thanks to some strings being pulled, several bribes and a few bothans, you've been given a limited diplomatic visa into the sector. Oh boy, right?
Dr blind man. You're here cause the money's good, the patients are plenty and well, you're a bit of an oddity, everyone and their cousin is talking about the blind man healing folks. You find yourself in your office, newly commissioned ((And gifted by the gm)) waiting for business.
Gunner. Raxas Prime<This place. Sure being a droid is simple, but as it stands out, the droids of the almas sector have given you a simple if not troublesome mission, discover this chiss business, and you'll be given holo projectors, and legal papers of citizenship, meaning you can own things.
Tyria. Things got hot, way to hot. People found out you were a skin job. Time to go. Doesn't take a real brain to figure that out. As soon as people started asking about you, and conclusions about who you are, and what you are were being made, you left. You'll never return to Bespin again. So you say anyway.
Wes- A mando's life involves two things. Family, and farms. Your world's thriving thanks to Boba Fett. And according to him, the mando's are to go out and make a name for 'em. Either hated or loved, here you are. The rim calls, you answered. Plus, people on the edge of nowhere always need a tough son of a bitch guarding them,a nd you, you're one of the best of the best.
For whatever reason, from whatever vantage point you see a parade of chiss soldiers and nobles, walking through the small star port, approximately 31. 30 soldiers and a noble looking type. They seem to be making their way through the port to the "Town square." The buildings are standard construction ranging from 4-10 stories in height. Security is ultra tight. Which makes you all think, then why the hell is there someone on a room with a sniper rifle, aiming at the chiss?

Having just arrived by some transport I pay the captain for my trip. I then check that I have all my gear and then shoulder my bag and put on my cloak with the hood up and walk off ship.  make my way to the town square. Letting the force guide me(Use the Force-search your feelings-not sure if it can be used this way.) I do a basic perusal of what little town there is trusting that the force with guide me to what I seek.
Like in the opening seen of Phantom Menace all you can tell is that I am a Cathar and am wearing a long robe that hides everything I am carrying. I suspect most people will know a Jedi when they see one.

"Eargo's losing streak...it sounded more interesting in the planetary system list."  Tyria says, looking around forlornly, doing what teenagers do...which is to say the Replica droid was pouting.  Not a normal droid emotion to be sure, and unfortunately all too common in one that had her programming based off of a teenage girl.  Sighing, the pink haired human bounced along, looking for any signs that one of the mechanics shops were hiring, or that someone needed a pilot.  It was a major come down from her previous status, and someone looking for either probably wouldn't want a kid but it was something to do when you didn't have to sleep or eat, and the credits could be spent on shopping...and that was all the reason you needed really...it was shopping.
The teenager moved through the streets, finally coming to a stop at the Parade route as the Chiss and his escort began to go past her spot.  "A parade...thats like totally boring."  she mutters, her right hand tapping an irritated impatient beat on her thigh as she waits for the spectacle to pass so she can get to the shops on the otherside of the route.

The black floating sphere of the interrigation droid tapped its single underslung claw on the edge of the table. Then slowly it reached down and picked up the exogoth Ivory rook and carefully set it into place on the other edge of the board.
"Check.. Mate... Sir...", the droid said almost gleefully in a heavy British accent.
"Confound it! Butler!", Dr. Krell sat up and studied the board. Sure enough, he was trapped. "You know Im really starting to get tired of this!"
He got up and walked to the window of his office.
"Im sorry sir.. ", said the droid behind him. "Shall I let you win next time, or would you prefer I reprogam myself to be more stupid?"
Dr. Krell ignored the sarcasm in the doid's voice. It wasnt the game he was tired of, it was this rock. For six months he had been stuck here, his ship in the repair dock. He had not meant to land here, but a faulty gyrostabalizer had made him unable to land on any planetary surface. When the first set of techs had gone into repair it, they had blown three backplanes of the navcomputer. Thats when he hired the second set of techs. And of course, they would have to order parts.
"Why dont you organize the patients history", he said without looking to the droid.
"Already done. sir.. twice..." the droid paused for a second. "and.. now three times". At least he had enough patients to pay the bills. Iddot lower class space buffoons were allways getting shot, or beaten, or finding some strange rash around their reproductive organs.
Out the window, he saw a squad of Chiss marching towards the town square. Something tingled in him... something... Wrong.
He closed his eyes and reached out with the Force. Something was not right. He felt like he was on the plains of Zeltros right before a thunderstorm.
"Butler... I want you to pack up all the important equipment... Drugs, tools, harts, computer records, anything not easily replaceable.... take them to the ship. Now."
"Are we leaving sir? Need I remind you, the ship is not operational".
"We dont know that.. the parts should have arrived two days ago". He looked down at the troops massing again. "Do it and do it quick. I have a feeling. If im wrong.. it will just mean you get the joy of unpacking everything again."
"And if your right Sir?", said the droid.
"We wont be here much longer anway. You have an hour. Tops."
The Doctor grabed his cloak and left the office to head towards the square.

With the sort of precise timing, that no Organic could or would appreciate, Gunner had arrived on the planet several days prior to this display. Feeling that Assassination was implied in his mission order, the former droid fighter found a suitable vantage point from which to rake blaster fire down upon the assembled masses.
In his customary inspection for possible escape routes, Gunner came across the Sniper. "Your presence here has a 95% probability of interfering with my objectives. Course of action: Eliminate possible threat."
Knowing blaster fire would attract attention, Gunner closed the distance to engage the man in hand-to-hand.
(Move: charge the sniper
Standard: melee attack +8 1d3+4)

Marching at the for front of the column of his escort of troops, he can't quite place the feeling that is gnawing at the back of his mind. This type of display was normally best left to parades on Csilla, not some back water world where his pressence was deemed in more than one place an inconvenience to more that one of the local law makers. And he should know, it cost enough credits to get this measly dimplomatic visa, and when he recieved it they ask him to go marching as if on a victory parade through a warren of homes and shops in the starport like some sort of side show!
Lets just hope the accomendations they had designated for him and his escort were up to standard. Most of these outer rim worlds just didn't have anything on the systesm in Assendacy's space.
But no matter what he let his mind wander to he could not shake the feeling. One he had learned to listen to from his years in the service. He didn't make it out of all those scrapes his unit had bumbled into by chance. Strict thought, careful planning and above all watching for the unexpected earned him and these men with him multiple commendations and much aclaim back on Csilla. Double checking that his personal shield generator was operating by the settings on his wrist controls, Tam starts to scan the crowd and his surroundings, to try to locate the source of his bad feeling.

"This planet is a karking dump." The modulated voice said as the parade passed by.
"Excuse me." The security officer that was standing next to him said in an irritated voice.  The lieutenant bars on his lapel showed him to be someone of importance in the security detail. 
Wes turned his head looked at the officer.  The mans face reflected back from the shiny visor of the Mandalorians helmet.  "I said this planet is a karking dump."  He returned his gaze to the parade and the street.  The Chiss were now passing by in an orderly fashion just asking for trouble.  *Typical.* Wes thought.
The security officer's scowl deepened as he was about to open his mouth he saw the Mando shift.  The carbine that was resting in the nook of his left arm was still there but now with the shift in posture it was pointed at him.  The officer had already heard of the Mando's reputation which was why he had been hired on as an extra detail for the security.  The prospect didn't sit well with the officer. 
Staking a step back the man simply scowled and resumed his duties of watching for trouble.
Smiling under the helmet Was enjoyed that.  He made the people here uneasy.  It was understandable considering the history and legend of Mandalorian warriors. 
A soft click signaled the activation of the armors environmental systems attempting to regulate the temperature.   
Scanning the buildings he saw something.  At least he thought he did.  Keeping an eye on the window he backed up a step to be next to the officer.  it was then he spotted the barrel of a blaster rifle poking out of the window.  Only a foot of it was visible but it was enough to not be mistaken. 
"There at 3 o'clock, 5th story third window over, there's a blaster in the window.  Alert your forces." 
Wes moved in the direction of the sniper.  *Finally something is happening.* He thought

Gunner-
The helmet on his head hides his face. The body armor he is wearing is black, and smoothe.
Perception check as you charge.
Wes-
You see a black helmeted man on a roof of a building, you also see a droid up there as well, looks like the droid is moving fast as well.

Seeing the Chiss, the sniper Sulvar knows the force directed him correctly and moves with confidence and trust in the force to place himself between the obvious Chiss VIP and the sniper ready to return blaster bolts to sender. To everyone I look like I just decided to cross the street. (Readying action to quick draw as a free action and to deflect and redirect back to the shooter.)

"There are people up on the roof fighting.  You might want to look for cover...if it wouldn't ruin your parade I mean.  Marching in ranks and all would probably be bad if one of them decides to shoot, I could be wrong though."  Tyria called out to the parade cheerfully.  Wanting to warn the people they were in danger, but at the same time poking fun at what she saw as a ridiculous spectacle, it was a teenager thing.
Seeing a cloaked man suddenly move toward the Chiss at the head of the parade Tyria rolls her eyes at the security or lack thereof and moves to intercept the cloaked being...the Chiss might pay a reward...besides he was kind of a cutie and to her way of thinking, cuties who obviously had money should be protected.
(Move action to get next to the cloaked figure, ready an action to quickdraw both Vibro-hatchets if he draws a weapon)

The armor doesn't have any grooves.

Tam seeing that his feeling of unease was founded snapped quickly into action and quickly started issuing orders to his escort.
Tam reached for the blaster at his hip and had it unsheathed in one quick motion, while his troops began rushing into positon. Tam then looked to the cloaked feline male that stepped into his path, as he started moving to cover near one of the store fronts. Looking inside he saw that it was a doctors office, great he thought, we may need one of these before the day is over. Obviously this sham of a display that sniviling coward requested as part of the deal for the visa was a set up.
**"Men set up a perimeter around this facility.  You two, get inside and secure this building, we may need to fall back into."**  Looking to the Cathar and the young woman he speaks, **"Friends you may wish to step in doors with me, this situation is seemingly a bit dangerous."**  Turning to one of his underlings he shouts, **"Give me Fire Support on that roof sargeant!"**

Turns to Tyria and calmly assesses her. Not feeling her in the force he says "Currrious" then looks up at where the sniper was and assesses if he needs to go up there. Sulvar radiates calm as if he does not have a care in world.

### **Avarna** (2009-02-04 14:06:06)

With no groves in the armor, there were a number of possibilities. One that he was fighting another droid, however the speech patterns its used don't conform to any that were acceptable for a droid (at least in Gunner's opinion). The second and far more probably was the organic in the armor simply had very nice armor.
"Negative." Gunner replied in his emotionless baritone voice. Slamming the would be sniper against the ground, If it was a droid, he would be able to get what answers he needed by accessing the unit's memory core. 
(Standard: Hit him again +4 1d3+4)

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-04 14:16:01)

"Whats curious?"  Tyria asks the cloaked figure, not liking the fact that he had already turned away after glancing at her briefly, it was insulting.  "I take it you aren't working with that assassin up there?  Your lucky then, I was going to turn you into swiss cheese if you drew a weapon.  It wasn't really the best idea to run out into the middle of a parade when there is already a sniper aiming at the guy your charging."  the girl points out.

Looks back a Tyria "You arrre a Currrious Drrroid. And no I  do not worrrk with assassins. I find them distasteful. And I doubt you would turrrn me into swiss cheese." Looks to where Tam went and starts walking towards him. Calls out "I believe you are the one I was sent to speak too."

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-04 14:35:28)

Gunner, you slam into him, your fist hitting him in the gut. The man on the ground doesn't seem to be fighting back but he is in fact alive, and more importantly adjusting something on his belt.
Several of the chiss soldiers take up a parameter and begin opening fire on the rooftop.
Dr.
Heading outside you see 30 armed troops and 2 oddities. 1st- A cathar and a 16 year old have decided to hold a conversation in the middle of the street.
2nd. A mandolorian of some sort judging by the armor is looking up at the roof, or whats left of the roof right now as it's being turned to swiss cheese.
Perception checks for everyone but Gunner.
Tam, the cathar dressed in pilgrim's robes is approaching you. Some of your armed men, have raised their weapons in the cathar's direction.
"Orders?" One of them asks.

Dr Krell takes the steps down from his upstairs office to the waiting rooms below. Outside he hears a terrible comotion, like the marching of many feet. Outside, siloueted against the pane glass windows of his office, he sees the soliders from the square taking a defensive stance, their backs to him. They were encircling his building!
"Damn it all to hell", he swore under his breath, swirling his cloak around his shoulders and fastening it with the gold clasp at the shoulder. He was tingling with warning. "Im too late", he thought to himself. "This was what I should have avoided"
He walked across the plush carpet of his practice. Two soldiers walked up to him.
"Were sorry sir but...", Dr. Krell silenced them with his palm. He looked openly at their ranks.
"You two are enlisted. I dont talk to enlisted. Where is your officer?"

### **Yogi** (2009-02-04 15:01:45)

Was spots the commotion on the roof.  It seems that the would be assassin is entangled with someone else.  He shifts his view to the Chiss who are now moving in an organized manner towards an office building.  *Isn't that nice.*  While a robed figure and a young woman stand in the middle of the street.  *I knew I should not have taken this job.  Everyone here is as smart as a bantha.*
Picking up his pace he hurries through the crowd towards the office and the two in the street.
He began looking around for any others that may also have sights on the Chiss.  In his thoughts his earlier reference of a "karking dump" echo though his mind.

Tyria looks quite put out...and possibly a little scared by the Cathar's statement.  How did he know?  How could he possibly know what she was.  Human Replica Droids were built to be absolutely perfect copies of their species, nothing was suppoused to be able to give them away since they were built for espionage. The very fact that Tyria was able to feel and have her facial features project that fear and uncertainty was all the proof that was needed to show how advanced a droid she was.
"How...how did you know?  Do...do I have a wire showing?  Wait...you know what I am and still assume I couldn't beat you...and you know what I am...are you one of those guys with a funny sword and the whole wave your hands thing?  Your a jedi?  That is soo cool."  the teen says shifting from intial shock to hopefulness...Jedi were interesting.  She drifts along in the Cathar's  wake as he approaches the Chiss and his escort, ready to draw her Vibro hatchets at a moments notice.

Dr, Wes. You two are in the basic vicinity of the hell thats unfolding. You see a black speeder with an open hatch on the back. Three figures, one holding a blaster cannon on his shoulder,the other two with look like appears to be a rocket launcher of some sort. They're wearing black grooveless armor.
Dr, the force is your ally, your friend, your step sister that beats you occassionally. Something is not right about those three. And you're damn sure, the chiss soldiers are about to be slaughtered.
Jedi-
The officer in charge of the soldiers appears to be hunkered down, issuing orders and standing fast. The force alerts you to the three in the speeder. Also, someone is very mad.

Looking over from directing his men, Tam Notices several of his troopers being confronted by a haughty looking human. *Of all the times to get caught up by the aristocracy…* Tam thinks and starts to move over to defuse the situation.
*This situation was getting worse by the minute* Looking up Tam sees the speeder approaching with the heavy artillery. And Starts to rush over to the Haughty human. **"Sir, If you haven't noticed we're in a bit of a situation here,"** pausing slightly while his statement is punctuated by blaster fire, **"we need to move inside your facility immediately.

"Uhh...uhh...yea, MOVE!" Tyria shouts, looking at the speeder and the men who obviously were pretty rich given the matching outfits and party favors they were carrying.Â  The 16 year old started to move, not liking being on the down range end of all that weaponry.
With reflexes and grace slightly beyond normal for a human teen Tyria ripped out her Vibro-weapons and charged at the speeder, she was already bringing the one held in her left hand down as she was closing with the vehicle, timing the the descent of the rapidly vibrating weapon very precisely for her arrival at the speeder.

Dr. Krell looked at the Chiss. He had the air of command that went beyond just leadership. He was obviously of royal blood. Noblity had a way of sensing other nobility.
He nodded to the Chiss "Im a Doctor... I can help. Get your men into my building."
He looked over at the speeder, and anger began to build up in him. He felt the force begin to rise inside him, like tidal wave.

Seeing the man start to fiddle with something on his belt, Gunner immediately assumes it some sort of powerful explosive device, designed to remove all evidence of the would-be assassin should it come to this sort of situation where he was going to be captured. At least that's what Gunner himself would have in a similar situation.
With options limited, Gunner decided on a course of action, that even his processors labeled as reckless. The droid threw the man out the window.

The street delved into chaos with the arrival of the speeder.  The three black armored figures were armed for a reckoning.  A Reckoning that was going to come down on the Chiss.  *Blaster cannon and two rocket launchers.  These guys mean business.*  
The chaos in the street was distracting.  But for a trained Mandalorian Warrior the chaos of battle was a lullaby.  Bringing up his weapon he took aim on one of the two carrying rocket launchers.  *Best to take out the heavy hitters.  Those rockets could bring down a building.*
"Take cover!" He yells.  
OOC:
Swift:  Two swift to aim.

The action unfolds in one split second.
Tam and his crew take cover, the 16 year old slashes into one of the troopers, her vibro axe shredding into the strange armor, blood, bits of metal and gore rise up into the air briefly as the axe makes a "Thwash noise."
Wes takes aim, and lets loose the hell that's part of his arsenal. The trooper with the launcher takes a dir nap. The rocket goes off. The car explodes, fragmented metal goes everywhere raining debris hits the ground, chunks of trooper and speeder hit the area in a thunderous applause.
The trooper tossed out the window, smashes through the glass, impacts the ground and shakes violently. His armor restricts on itself, and a crushing sound is heard.
Through the chaos a dull chime can be heard, those without helmets remember basic biology. Whatever frequency that was, won't ever be heard again by you as your brain makes the connection.
The street's a mess, the people who were here, are running around like womprats without their heads. Some of the chiss soldiers ((5)) were caught in the explosion. They won't be doing the corellian jig anytime soon, to say the least.
So, there you are, the street's a mess, the space port is in chaos, and you all finally see each other.

Tyria slowly skidded to a halt, the motion of her backflip to escape the impending explosion having been expended.  It was good her reflexes were what they were, otherwise she'd have been flash fried in the explosion, and probably deafened to boot, but thankfully she wasn't as...delicate as she otherwise appeared and droids were made of tougher stuff than organics.
Turning to look at the mess that were the downed soldiers, and the chunky salsa remaining in the speeder, Tyria fell to her knees and started to dry heave, a reflex from her copied memories and mannerisms.  "Gross..." she mutters.
"Can we go some where else?  This place is gona make me...ugh."  she tells the Cathar.

Gunner picked up the sniper rifle that the assassin was going to use, and straps it to his back. After calculating the fall, and determining he would take minimum damage, he simple lets himself fall out of the window, finding it quicker then climbing down to the street level.
The droid ignores the carnage around him, as he goes to the man he threw out of the window. "Negative life signs. Target eliminated.

As Tam watches the speeder explode and several of troopers are hit in the blast he springs into action.
**"Doctor, I need to see to my men, do you have any supplies, Gurneys that we can try to attend to those that are wounded. I will compensate you for what ever is needed and the services rendered, but time is of the essence."**
Stepping out of the door he orders his troopers to attend to the wounded and looks expectantly towards the doctor.
Hearing one of his Sergeants approach him he turns, **"Status report sergeant. How many wounded? How many Dead?"**

Before he can reach out against the attackers, one of the locals fires on them and the whole speeder goes up in a big fireball. Dr Krell jumps into action.
Instinct taking over, and ignoring the Chiss Officer, he starts barking orders. "Get the wounded to my office NOW"l He points to Tam and Wes. "I have instastrechers in my office folded by the back door! Go Go!". He pulls out his comlink. "Butler! We have five with serious injuries, Prep the two tables.
He runs over to the nearest wounded. Pulling out his medikit he gives the solider a shot of pain killer and runs to the next.

Jumping into action behind the doctor he pulls out his own medkit from his belt and sees to the nearest wounded soldier.
In Cheunh to his nearest troopers, **"You heard the man, get them into the building now. We'll try to stabilize any one we can."**

Jolted out of her miserable contemplation of the Jedi by the yelling of the Chiss and the other man...presumably a doctor, Tyria moved over to the closest of the wound soldiers, and did her best to supress the implanted reflex to vomit.  She leans over the Chiss soldier and pulls the medpack off her built and does what she can to staunch the worst of the man's injuries...keep him alive long enough for someone with real experience to deal with the actual putting him back together.

Depressing the trigger Was let loos a shot.  An instant later his intended target flies off the speeder.  His helmet now a smoking crater.  But before he left the vehicle the rocket fired into the speeder.  To his left the sniper impacts on the ground.  He can already tell by the bodies position that the sniper is dead. 
Wes hurried through the commotion to where the Jetii stood in the road and surveyed the area.  He looked at the Jetii as he walked towards a man.  Knowing that the Jetii may have sensed something he followed a bit behind the robed Cathar. 
In passing the Chiss Officer he spoke.  "Keep your men under cover.  There may still be more." 
He looked at the man the Jetii was walking towards.

Wes, the cathar is looking at a man with a droid, the man is also issuing orders for folks to head to his "office."
Gunner, surveying the scene your assess no threats whatsoever.

Tam grabs the sergeant and starts seeing to his wounded arm. Trying to Stabilize and throw on a make shift bandage before moving on to the more critically wounded.
In Cheunh, **" Help the walking wounded into the Medical Facility. You two,"** Pointing to a pair of Chiss Core men, **"Stabilize who you can and help get them into the facility. I want those that can be saved, to still be breathing at the end of this day."**
Rushing to stop the bleeding on a wounded soldier, Tam quickly starts working with the bandages and other tools imparted in his medical kit. Looking up to see a couple of the unscathed troopers running by with a wounded soldier on a gurney he try's to do his part for his men.
Caught completely by surprise and he only had himself to blame. Lulled into complacency by some bureaucratic sleemo who convinced him to walk his men down to their deaths for a visa, rage boiled in him, but he held it in check. Years of military service taught him that now composure was needed, for his men, both wounded and unscathed needed a clear headed and deliberate leader.
**"Once the wounded are inside I want guards on the doors, Front and back. The Core men will assist the doctor and my self in seeing to the wounded."**

Without any immediate threats, Gunner reassessed his priorities. Return to Alpha Objective, learn the reason behind the Chiss infestation. Standing up the combat droid scans the Chiss as he walks past them leading back into the doctor's office. Following the sound of the one giving orders, Gunner walks directly towards Tam.
Slamming his fist into the wall behind the humanoid's head, he boldly asks. "Are you the Chiss Commanding Officer? What is Your Objective in this system!?!"

Seeing four of his rushing troopers level carbines at the droid who just slammed a fist through a wall, he motions for them to hold their fire.
**"Droid, if you haven't noticed here, I'm attempting to help the critically wounded. My mission is of a diplomatic source, and I would be more than willing to speak with you about it after these men are seen to. Besides enough death has occurred today, I would prefer if my men could stop aiming their weapons at you and get back to helping their fallen comrades."** 
After saying that, Tam goes back to seeing that the wounded are moved into the medical facility.

### **Yogi** (2009-02-04 20:49:04)

As he followed the Jetii the conversation he hears turns to the wounded.  Picking up that the man was a Doctor Wes stood down a bit.  The immediate threat seemed to be over.  The Jetii walked away towards teh dead sniper that lay sprawled on the ferrocrete. 
He walked to the entrance of the building that the Chiss soldiers were setting up a triage center.  They seemed to have things well in hand as their CO issued orders.  *This one is at least setting up a defensive perimeter.  The others…*
Seeing the droid that was on the roof enter the building his sensors pick up the shouting from inside.  "Time to check in on things." He says inside his helmet. 
He advanced on the troopers set up at the front door.  At almost 2 meters Wes in his armor was an imposing sight.  Two troopers leveled their blasters at him.  The one in command. held up his hand to ward them off.  "He was the one who shot the one with the rocket launcher men.  Stand down."    The Chiss looked back to him.
"I'd like to speak with your Commanding Officer."  Wes said it loud enough for the others inside to hear it.  If no response he figured he would just enter anyway.

Tyria realized quickly that the man's wounds were beyond her limited expertise in the medical field.  "This man needs a doctor.  His wounds are really bad."  the teenager says, rising to her feet and following the Jedi over to the doctor.  She was naturally curious about what had led to all of this.

Dr. Krell looks at the Girl for a second with a puzzeld expression on his face. "Your a very curious girl".
He walks over to where she bandaged the solider. "Not a bad job. But he needs more than this." he says to the girl. This one doesnt have any spinal injuries. If I get his torso, can you carry his legs".
He carefully lifts the man up to carry him into his office.
"You... in the Robes!"  he yells at the Jedi. "Can you help some of these wounded into my office. There are several with non-critical shrapnel wounds that will need to be tended to."

Gunner stands there very still for several moments as he considers what Tam has told him. Then once again, the droid fighter approaches the Chiss. "I find your proposal, Acceptable. I will return in one standard hour."
At that the droid leaves the clinic, and returns to the corpse of one of the dead attackers. With one hand around its neck, he drags it along with him. As he approaches the first local, he hold up the body and asks. "Do you recognize the Paramilitary Organization using this Defensive Exo-skeleton?"
(Gather information -2, for info on the attackers)

Seeing the Mandolorian walking into the medical facility, he motions for him to approach.
**"You, your that one that hit the rocket launcher bearing thug. That blast killed five of my men, but it could have been far worse if not for your actions."** Standing up from the soldier he was attending he walks around to speak closer with the armored figure. **"It has been some time since I have seen a Mandolorian. What brings you to this planet? Employment? If thats the cause I will arrange to have my government pay you double to come on into our service. I fear my men are more for show here after this afternoons events."**
Turning to look over the wounded in the facility. **"Let me know of your decision, a man of your…talents…would be well recieved."**

Tam, the wounded are being cared for the best that they can. But it will leave you with ten men to command, and unfortunetly, these men were your escort here. From here, you've your own mission to complete.
Sulvar, you're a jedi not a dr. You move the men the best way you can, several of them are damn near dead. Unfortunetly, you've done all you can. Your paws and robes are covered in blood. Basically from moving all these men and getting out of a mini warzone.
Tyria, you get some assistance from the dr, not awhole lot, but enough to stop these men from dieying.
Wes, the situation's pretty grim, while this mess is happening though, no one seems to be watching the door. What happens if more come back?
Dr, you've haven't been this hard pressed since your days back at some random er you worked at once. People are barely able to hold it together, and your knowledge of chiss anatomy is somewhat limited. ((Knowledge life sciences))
Gunner, you slog on, and to your suprise, no one knows nothin'. Even by intimidating them, no one seems to know anything about the men, and that armor. They know about the fire fight, but besides that. Nothing.
The sniper's body looks crumpeled as if someone squeezed a grape. On his person you find some power packs, a utility belt that looks hardwired into the armor. The armor looks like it's bonded with the thing's skin.

Sulvar Carries the Snipers body to the Dr's office and then helps the Dr where he can.
After all the Wounded are  dealt with he asks the Chiss and the Dr if they know anything about this body. He points out that the armor seems to be bonded to the body. Like the Yuuzhan Vong do...

**"Core men!,"** Tam shouts to grab their attention. "I need you to take six of the remaining men and your selves and get the wounded aboard our crusier where they can be properly looked after."
Pausing and then continuing on, **"We have a mission here and a diplomat from the New Republic to meet with. No matter what those terrorists believe, we will not be detered from our mission."**
**"You two. Stop Gawking at your friends. There unfortunately is nothing more we can do for them now. Thanks to the quick acting of the doctor we will not be sending too many more to their final rest."**  Looking over to the dumbfounded troopers he continues, **"You men will be accompanying me for the remainder of our mission, stay alert, there may be more of those attackers out there."**

Of  the three dying men, two have been stabalized and two were on the table. Outside in his front room, half a dozen wounded but stable men groaned. Dr. Krell's white shirt was covered in blood.
"Apply pressure here", he said to Butler, his floating medical droid.
"Yes Sir", said the droid with a lack of his usual sarcasm.
Dr. Krell finished up the last suture. "This one is closed", he turns to the young girl who is watching in the corner. "Ive finished sutures and cleanup, Can you dress this wound?" He points to the table "Instaskin spray, antibod cream, clean gause and adhesive bandage... in that order, and then ask the soliders to move him to one of the beds in the room to the left".
Butler, his medical droid that had suffered the ingomy of being stuffed into an interrigator droid chasis had already turned to the next patient. The doctor turned aruound to that table. He had to work fast, or the Arm would have to come off.
pplying three shots of pain killer, he checked the paitents life signs through his Medicalvisor. "20CC Antibox, and then I want nano-repartives", he said to the droid. Glancing over to his supply cabinet, he saw he was almost out of the tiny nano-bots that did internal self healing on most organics.  He pulled a small metal pin out of the autoclave and begain to screw it into the the two halfs of the man's Humerous. He was going to have to attache the main atery back from where it has been cautorised by hot metal to the lower half of his hand, or else the hand would atropy and die.
He and the droid worked calmy and quickly.
> Treat Inury +15, +2 with medical Visor for a total of +17.

After leaving the body in an appropriate trash receptacle, Gunner returns to the clinic exactly one standard hour after he left. While disappointed the organics knew little about the attackers, this had simply been a secondary objective to consume the time.
Walking once more thought the front door of the clinic, the droid went directly to Tam. "Its has been exactly one standard hour. You will now answer my inquiries. What is your objective in this system?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-05 14:54:28)

Tam looked up as the droid came back into the Medical Office. Seeing the shakey troopers following him raise their carbines at it he motiosn for them to lower there weapons. **"So it has droid. My name is Tam Altor. What is your designation or name?"**
After hearing the response he continues.
**"I'm here on a diplomatic mission from Csilla. The details are classified so you'll excuse me if I don't throw them at you, but I did see how you dispatched the sniper earlier and will give you a limited briefing of my mission for your assistence."**
Turning he ques up his datapad. **"I was sent here to meet a New Republic representative about Asscendacy expansion in near by sectors. I'm carrying a diplomatic visa and that should be enough for you."**

### **Avarna** (2009-02-05 15:16:40)

"This unit has been giving the designation of Gunner." The droid responds, Behind his optics its almost as if every little thing the diplomat says is being carefully taken apart and examined. But he remains silent while Tam speaks. Of course the classified information regarding the blue-skins mission would be most desirable.
"Service for information is an acceptable exchange." Gunner responds after a few moments pause. "You will have my services for 48 standard hours, before renegotiation is required."

Tyria accepts the doctor's instructions first helping to carry the injured man and then doing as he asks her to do down to the letter, her personality temporarily giving way as it always did when she attempted something that the original Tyria's memories and personality hadn't attempted to do, overtime her personality would attach itself to the skills, but whoever had made her had set things up so that when things mattered non-essentials would give way to the more critical aspects.
"I guess you don't have a bacta tank here doctor?"  Tyria asks, naming the miracle cure for just about everything.  If someone survived long enough to get a dunking in a bacta tank chances are they had a 97% survival rate.  Wars had been fought over the stuff, and every hospital in the Galaxy head a few dozen tanks, even medical bays in starships.
"So Mr. Tam why did those men want to kill you?  Or is that a state secret?"  the pink haired girl asks, rolling her eyes in an entirely teenage way that cut through species lines.

"Unfortunatley not", the doctor said closing up the last patient. He pulled the last stich tight and began cleaning off the wound area. Butler, the droid held out a cleansing towel for him to wash his hands with.
"This backwater hunk of rock apparently had all of its bacta stolen by the gap-toothed locals, and then the origonal hospital shut down. Ive only been here since my ship needed repairs. Unfortunately while I think the parts are in, the half-brain pesants on this rock blew up more than they fixed the first time. And now I cant find two mechanics that will take time to stop fighting, drinking,  or mating with the locals long enough to get it done properly"
He walked over to the Girls table and examined her work.
"Good Job!", he nodded. "The next one is ready for you. Same procedure. What is your name anyway?"

Looking over to the young human Tam ponders where such a curios girl came from. He had watched her flay one of the terrorists like a knife through warm butter. Hmmm.... questions for another time he sighed.
**"Young one, I have no idea. In part of the bargain for the diplomatic visa I was given it was requested that we make a showy parade. It should have tipped me off that it was a set up, but I guess foolish pride dictated that nothing would go wrong when I was in command. I've been fighting wars for quite some time."** Sighing and looking around the room he mutters, **"Though the causalities of your men are something you never get used to."**
**"Thank you, I noticed I never gave you your due for that warning you shouted. Those terrorists would have had a much easier time of dispatching my men and I with out any of you."**  Motioning to the room and the assembled beings and one very blood thristy droid.

"Tyria, Tyria Thane."  the teen says, moving over to the next of the men, following the same process again, it was a good thing she had a replayable memory so that she didn't screw it up.
"I don't know about any of that local stuff, I just have what I hope is a short stop over here until I can find an outbound ship to somewhere more...central this place is...was totally boring."  Tyria says, and then blows her bangs back up to where they aren't blocking her line of sight.
"If your willing to give me a ride once your ship is fixed, I can probably handle the repairs if you already have the parts.  Working with my hands is something I actually know how to do...not like this stuff.
"That was some interesting armor that they were wearing.  I wouldn't mind getting my hands on it and pulling one of them apart to see what technique they used to get the armor like that."  she tells the Chiss.

As many go about fixing people, and many go about dieying, unfortunetly, the sgt of the away mission so to speak approaches Tam and pulls him aside.
"Sir, I hate to inform you of this, but we were to drop you here, escort you to your rep, and jump. As much as we would like to stay, we've already suffered losses that were uncalculated in previous sims of the mission. Once my men get fixed, I'm afraid we're bugging out. It looks like you have a jedi here, and from the stories of the skywalkers we've heard much of, and dealt with, I'm sure you'll be fine. We all have our orders, no matter how much we dont like them." The soldier stood firm still, holding his arm.
The armor is nothing like vong armor, as its metal, and not organic, the dr would have to do more extensive work on the sniper to fully examine the person inside.

The doctor looks at the girl. "yes, I see you are good with your hands. We can talk about your repairing the ship. Id want to know more about your... er.. family.. first."
He walks over to her and takes a small penlight out of his pocket and shines it in each of her eyes. "Very curious... very curious indeed. Your irises contract normally." He smiles at her. "Sometime Id like to talk to you about your unique... phisiology... but right now there are a few more wounded to attend to."
He then goes around and completes treatement of the cuts and scrapes of all the other soldiers. After about an hour he is finished.
He walks over to where the Jedi and the Officer and the Droid are standing.
"Well sir, I am happy to report that none of your soliders will be ending their career today". He wipes his bloody hands on a clensing towel. "They are all stable enough for transport back to your ship."
Now.. that the living are treated.. I think we can deal with the dead..."
He smiles a thin smile which you cant quite tell if its hidden disgust, or hidden pleasure.
"I think an autopsy on our Sniper friend is due...  Can you get your droid to place him on the table?"

"Hey watch it.  Thats bright."  Tyria says blinking..."Of course my eyes work, I don't have a concussion or anything."  the girl retorts.
Tyria continues to assist the doctor until all of the men have been treated.  Once everyone had been treated she went with him to join the Jedind the Chiss officer.  She eyed the rather violent droid very warily.
"Looks like your going to be left to your own devices for finding out why these guys were so tickled to make your aquaintance.  What are you going to do?"

"I will gladly place a deceased organic upon the table. Shall I start with you doctor?" Gunner replies but otherwise not moving. He follows the Chiss into the room.
"Please state your objectives to me, in order of priority." Gunners service was currently to Tam, and unless the Blue-skin says otherwise, the droid will only take direction from him.

Looking past the Trooper at the door Wes saw the Chiss Commanding Officer wave him in.  Chase walked past the trooper.  â€œYour CO is directing me inward.â€  He took several steps into the building but was mindful to stay out of the way of the wounded. 
"You, your that one that hit the rocket launcher bearing thug. That blast killed five of my men, but it could have been far worse if not for your actions."  The officer said to him as he came around to come closer. 
â€œYes I was.â€  He answered through his helmet.  â€œYour losses were unfortunate.  But I also agree that it would have been much worse for you and your men if I had not acted.â€ 
The officer regarded him for a second.  "It has been some time since I have seen a Mandolorian. What brings you to this planet? Employment? If thatâ€™s the cause I will arrange to have my government pay you double to come on into our service. I fear my men are more for show here after this afternoons events."
â€œEmployment, yes.  I was hired on as an addition to supplement the security forces here.  Itâ€™s obvious that they need more.â€  Wes thought about the offer that was given to him.  *Double huh.  This might just be worth my while.  There have been some upgrades Iâ€™ve wanted to get. This would be a good way.  Besides if word gets out that Iâ€™ve been hired by a Chiss it would be good for me considering their reputation.*  He thought. 
"Let me know of your decision, a man of your...talents...would be well received."
Wes simply gave a single nod of his head.  And took a step back out of the way.  The work that was going on in here to save as many lives as possible was admirable.  He went and stood by the door and kept an eye out. 
Wes watched the others in the room.  The Chiss officer was on top of things.  The orders he gave made sense and gave his shaken men a job to do.  That was important to keep oneâ€™s mind on mission as the death of comrades can lead to indecision.  And Indecision can lead to more deaths. 
The droid was interesting.  He wasnâ€™t sure what to make of it yet other than its erratic behavior.  He would keep an eye on it. 
The young girl seemed normal.  Odd for one to be carrying weapons as she does. 
The Doctor knew his trade very well.  From what noticed he believed that no more of the Chiss soldiers that were injured would perish today. 
The Jetii always had their motives.  Always thinking that the universe needed saving from itself and that they were the only ones that could do it.  Yes that were good in a fight but often didnâ€™t have the ability to finish it when it needed to be finished.  Time would tell with this one if she shared the same perspectives that many of the Jetii had.
When the autopsy was getting ready to begin Wes stepped closer.  He wanted to see.  The armor was strange.  One he had never seen before. 
â€œIâ€™ll say one thing,â€ He said to the group. â€œIâ€™ve seen many types of armors in my life.  I have never seen anything like this before.â€

Looks at Tam.
    "Perhaps you can explain what is going on? Seems like you were set up. Is there something going on in the Chiss Ascendancy we should be aware of? Can you enlighten us on this?" Pointing at the strange armor. looks at his hands in disgust.
While waiting for a response he grabs a towel and starts to try and get the blood out of his fur.

Tam looked at the Sergeant and nods. **"That wasn't in my briefing sergeant, but I understand your orders. Especially after this,"**  motioning around the room, **"Fiasco. Take care of the wounded, and yourself trooper. I expect to see you all on Csilla in good order when I return."**  Shaking the Sergeant's hand he turns and starts to move away.
Walking over to the mandolorian, **"How does my offer sound, I can arrange to have my people move the credits to your account."** Pointing back to the troopers, **"As you've heard my escort is returning to Chiss space and I could very much use your services."**
Looking over to the Cathar, **"So your the contact I was supposed to meet here? Should have known they'd send a Jedi."** Chuckling softly to him self he continues, **"I don't know why they would attack me. My mission here was merely to negotiate trade routes for the Asscendancy. My family has been in that industry for quite some time and we wished secure some ties with the New Republic before any unpleasnantries that may occur from the aggressive expansion of my people."** 
Looking over to the droid holding the body of the assailant he points, **"Although Master Jedi, I would be very interested in learning who would attack a diplomat on a non threataning mission of trade."**
Moving over to the droid, **"Gunner, please place the body on the table and let the doctor work on the body. I hope the good doctor can discover the nature of this attack."** Directing the droid to place the dead sniper on the table Tam then steps back to allow the doctor to work unhindered.

The group gathers around the dr as he works on the armored figure.  He appears to be a humanoid of some sort anyway. The dr cuts away the external skin, the armor, around his face. This man has no mouth, yet he spoke. Bio-metric circuitry is fed into his ears from the armor.
There aren't any symbols on the armor, but there is a bar code on the under side of the helmet. As you all look at the thing's face, the bone's crushed from the helmet, his head almost to damaged to discern anything.

Examining the body more, cutting the armor back more. The organs looks "Right" for the most part, I mean they just crushed after all.
The dr takes a sample and runs it through a dna processor. He goes back to the body and looks it over a bit more, with a perception check ((I rolled)) you discover the barcode has  a small but noticeable logo under it.  ((knowledge galactic, rolled for all of you, Tam, suprisingly enough and the dr get it)) The logo is for "Dynocorp industries."
The dna check comes back minutes later. The species was human at one point, but heavily modified with gene slicing, he shares the characteristics of a human, trandoshan, cathar, wookie, and most suprisingly an advanced droid, what you thought were t-cells, were in fact nanites, tiny machines doing the work of the t-cell.
Tam, your mind wanders, hell of a time to do that, Dynocorp, sounds familiar, almost like its at the tip of your tongue. Your government did some contracts with them for something, blaster rifles or some such. You know they're a weapons manufacturer of some sort, but bio tech was never their marketable service. As far as you know.
What powered the armor was a fusion pulse generator spread out around his armor, and cascading up  and down his arms and legs, quite ingenious, and far ahead of it's time. His belt looks like it's tied directly into his spinal cord, flipping the body over, you see that the spine has simply folded on itself. Blue, black and red wiring connects the belt to the spine, through further exploration ((Knowledge technology untrained)) you find that those wires serve as nerve cords, by pressing a command sequence on the utility belt it sends a direct feed pulse from the generator to the spine, snapping it, folding it, in this case, it simply folded.
The autopsy continues, several minutes go by of hushed silience, none of you know who or what Dynocorp does, but you know they're a major company on the fringe.

Dr Krell uses a set of spreaders to pry open the sawn apart ribs with a sickening wet crunching sound. A very, very bad aromoa fills the room.
"This is absolutley facinating!" says the doctor peering down into the now open chest cavity ,  his head inches from the body, and a huge smile on his face.  He his now bare chested, except for an apron, and waves one blood soaked arm in Tyria's direction, barley missing her before he finds his penkife on the table.
"Ive never seen anything like this in my whole career!". He shines the light down into the cavity. "Look at this! Redundant cardiovascular systems! What a brilliant design!"
He looks up to the nauseated crowd. "You know!" he says pointing the penlight at Tam across the table for empahsis. "This is clearly a highly advanced biological weapon. Light years ahead of its time. Were looking at the cutting edge of warfare. This is probably a half million dollar clone! Someone really wants you dead! If it were not for that crazy attack droid of yours, you probably would be!"
He sneezes, and suddenly the penlight slips out of his bloody hand, bounces twice on the rib bones of the subject and falls inside.
"Damn!" it turned off!", says the doctor. He inserts his arm inside the cavity and feels around. He looks in again with a curious expression. "It must have slipped down into the lower abdomen. Thats my best light! Ive had it since before graduation!". He inserts his arm up to the elbow into the corpse.
"So", he says to Tam still rooting around. "Any luck on who made this?"

Looks at the Dr. "You wouldn't happen to have a Holonet connection here? Might be worth looking at what is on their Holopage. Not that I am skilled with computers but maybe one of you are and can see whats on the net...if nothing else we might find planets that are related. If someone is building a highly advanced assassin group who knows what else they are up too and planning?"
After seeing the Dr. drop his penlight into the cadaver...

"I hope you don't do that when you are performing surgery...", says the stoic lion faced Jedi.
"no.... no.... well.. rareley...." Says the doctor now up to almost his shoulder. "See the problem was the slits I made in the abdominal wall so I could check out the lower intestines.... Normally if something falls in, its right there to pick back up again."
With a very wet. long, suctioning sound, similar to a boot being pulled out of mud, the doctor pulls his mucous covered arm out. "There!", he says with a smile, brandishing his pen light. "Good as new!". He clicks the end, turning the light on and off several times to make sure it works, while bits of unidentifiable slime drop off the end of it. "Funny story you know, I once lost this light up the back side of a Bantha in a Xenobiology course at University!".
He puts the light on the tray next to Tyria.  "Could you clean that up, please?", he says to the girl.
"I do have a holonet hookup, its upstairs in  my office. I never turn it on. Nothing on the holonet but bad news and pictures of aliens mating. Your welcome to use it, if you wish". The doctor says reaching for a towel.
"As for the rifile, I have no idea if its the same. And Im certainly not goign to ask him for it".

"That is acceptable." Gunner replies, allowing Tam to temporarily take possession of the blaster rifle. In the meantime, he moves over to the computer terminal, and plugs into the socket.

"Eww...gross watch it doc.  I just bought this top in a botique on Bespin.  I don't want bio-whatever that thing is all over it."  Tyria says, ddging gracefully back away from the waving blood dripping arm.  Even so, she does stay close, finding the proceedings interesting especially since it was possible that the technology could somehow be related to her own in some way, even if it was more primitive.
"Clean it up yourself I'm not a servant..." Tyria grumbles, but she still washes the light anyway, he had asked nicely afterall, even if she wasn't comfortable with the familiarity of it.  Once it was cleaned, she moved over to the computer and began to familiarize herself with the system, granting herself all sorts of access rights that she was sure the doctor would give her if he had thought about it....she was just being polite by not troubling him with the details and bugging him while he was otherwise busy she rationalized in the way all teenagers seem to.
Once she had access to all of the computer's systems she connected into the holonet and started searching for all the information she could find on the corporation.  "Gunner, could you help me try to access some additional data on the corporation?  I think I know a few tricks that might help, but its always nice to have someone who speaks binary when dealing with a computer."
> Use Computers +10, Improving Attitude of the Doctor&#39;s Computer = DC of the Computer&#39;s Will save with a -2 for it starting off indifferent.  Taking 10 = 18.  Assuming the Doctor has a high end computer (int bonus of 2 or 3) the check succeeds.  She then improves access again from Friendly to Helpful with a result of 20.  (Or we can skip all of that and the Doc can just give me access and start off already at helpful).

Tam field strips the rifle, besides it being a master crafted item, it's just a rifle made by dynocorp. There are hand groves on the grip of the rifle itself, meaning it was made for this man, and this man alone. ((Yeah you can still use it but ya know.. fancy..))
**Searching the holonet brings up jawa on jawa action as well as a "Website" for dynocorp.
Founded 30 years before the battle of yavin, they produced power packs for the republic, and then the republic army. Not much can be said about them save for some business information, and their home base which is in Coruscant near the mountain range.
Checking their "message forums" you see nothing but great reviews of their product. Some digging and some slicing. Their first item ever created was a trash disposal unit, made from chrome, manufactured on Naboo.
More information, Their CEO is a half human/bothan ((EWWWWWWWWWW)) by the name Tr'lask Morow, he as well can be found on Coruscant, so says the site anyway.** 
Back to the body: Digging around more, you find another nifty piece of bio tech. His feet, are equipped with bio-electric repulsors. Translation, he can fly.  It looks like they were hard wired into his feet, and fed through the same fusion generator.

Wes listened to the Chiss officer as he asks about his earlier proposal.  To be honest it was a good offer.  Double the credits was nothing to balk at. 
He nodded once.  "I have thought about your offer and I accept.  Doubling the fee will make it come out to twelve hundred and fifty credits per day.  I trust that is satisfactory?  Even if it is not I will stay on station and protect those that are here as per my current contract with the planets security personnel."
He listened to the others as they examined the body.  Things were getting strange here.  Bio-engineered humans hard wired equipment in their bodies.  These beings sounded like a real challenge.  Something he was looking for.

Dr Krell carefully removes the repulsor jets and places them in a box.
"I think were done here, Butler", he says nodding towards the corpse. "If you have finished your holorecording, then you can move whats left of the body into the incinerator. I dont think we want any law enforcement snooping around on this."
He walks over to the sink and begins to wash up. "Here you go", he says handing some cleansing jell to the Jedi. "That should clean you up properly. Gets rid of 99% of known bioagents. Just dont get it in your eyes."

"I'm still pulling up more info...keep in mind how big the holonet is.  It has information from the entire galaxy made up of tens of thousands of systems, with each system having billions of bits of information.  It'll take a bit to slog through it."  Tyria points out.
"Okay, I think I've found what I can without hacking the company's computers...They have 4 testing sites.  Two on Naboo, one on Nar Shada, and another on Tattoine.  Anything else will take hacking their computers...and I'm not sure that I'm good enough to do it from a remote location like this."
"The deeds to the locations are owned by a "Jon Antilles."
"Your best bet would be to go to one of the Facilities and look into the files there."  Tyria says with a shrug.  Then she looks at Sulvar curiously.  "People kill each other all the time, mostly over money.  A trade agreement could be worth a lot of money, to some greed is the only thing that is worth killing for."

While up front I cannot tell you what will be the over all compensation, I personally will pay for your expenses for the mission if you require additional incentive up front, then I hope your own personal curiosity would suffice."**
Turning to the Cathar, **"Yes We should speak privately and attend to the business we were both sent here for."** Turning to the Human Doctor, **" Is there any where private we may discuss our business? It would seem to move our possible operations along we should attend to business immediately."**

((Yeah Tam, thats pretty good actually.))
The dr goes to his desk and removes a slip of paper, yes real paper, and hands it over the mechanics.
A typical invoice of labor can be seen on it, as well as cost, which according to these people, goes into the Tens of thousands.
The list of things that are broken on said ship-
According to the mechanics on this lovely world, your sensor screen is out, your hyperdrive is leaking and can't be fixed ((One look from someone with a brain says other wise)). Power fluxes in the starboard weapon system, the loading ramp sticks, and to top it off, you're over do on an oil change by at least One trillion Miles. All joking aside, the mechanics in the group are fully capable of fixing it.

The doctor nods in agreement to Tam.
"Have them send the parts to docking silp 14. Thats very kind of you."
He turns to Tyra who is giggling over the fact of how much he was being overcharged. "If you can take the time to stop making fun of me, I will explain the charges. You see my ship is a nice one, but its very old. Its a Citadel Class cruiser that my Grandfather brought back after the Clone wars. Grandfather was in the Navy, and well lets just say a few Septratist ships ended up on our planet for safekeeping instead of being turned over to the authorities".
He takes the paper out of her hands. "Much of the ship has been updated in bits and pieces. To tell you the truth, im a terrible mechanic. I can fly her enough to get from place to place, but often had to rely on the navcomputer and autopilot"
He looks at her and the Jedi. "If you think you can REALLY fix her, id be more than gratefull. She is a fine old ship. Her name is *The Golden Lucre*."

Looks at the doctor " ummm you prrrolly don't want me to worrrrk on yourrrr ship... I don't know the differrrrence between a hydrrrrospanner and a fusion cutter. But we Prrrrolly don't want to rrrremain herrre long if they sent 4 afterrrr Tam they will likely send morrre."

### **Avarna** (2009-02-06 20:29:19)

Gunner looks directly at the Jedi. "The fusioncutter was a handheld industrial cutting torch found throughout the galaxy. Some of the more popular models were the SoroSuub F-187 and the Jeron fusion cutter.
The common fusioncutter consisted of a handgrip and a long emitter, producing a high-energy plasma beam. This beam could slice through dense metals, duraplast, and other reinforced materials. The cutting beam was often adjustable, allowing the user to decrease the beam for fine, precise work, or to generate a wide-dispersion laser.
A fusioncutter's beam could be dangerous if not used correctly, though its limited range ensured the tool could not be effectively used as a weapon. However, fusioncutters were often carried into battle, notably by engineers during the Galactic Civil War and the preceding Clone Wars. These specialized engineers used fusioncutters to repair vehicles, turrets, health droids and supply droids on the battlefront.
The hydrospanner was a type of common hand tool used as an all-purpose socket wrench and bit driver. It was used to tighten or loosen types of fasteners, such as nuts, bolts, and multiple sizes of screws and pins. Hydrospanners were in common use throughout the galaxy. They were used in the building, repairing, and dismantling of any mechanical device or structure like droids, equipment, starships, and related works of engineering.
Most common hydrospanners could create a large amount of torque with little effort on the user's part, and offered various features for convenience. The Regallis Engineering FastTurn-3 Hydrospanner had an internal power source with a tension adjuster and a hinge on the socket driver to allow the user to access bolts and such in tight angles. The FastTurn-3 also had a spare bit compartment in the handle and a data port to connect a diagnostic device or datapad. The FastTurn-3 could also fit different sized nuts ranging from 2mm to 250mm in diameter, while using a small fusioncutter to remove molecular adhesives or welds before loosening. "

"Even so...ok don't worry about it, once I have the parts I'll get your ship going."  Tyria says, trying to keep a straight face.  Assuming the ship wasn't hundreds of years old, the prices probably were gouging, but it wouldn't do to anger the doctor.  She does laugh outright at Gunner's reply to the Cathar's hyperbole though, that was quite funy.

"Well I think thats settled. However, before we depart, Tyria I think we should make sure things are ok with your.... parents... By all appearances.. our still a minor by Imperial standards. Would you mind comming upstairs to my office so we can talk privately for a moment?" He nods to the other assembled and walks through the door to the front room and motions to the stairwell up to his office.

"Imperial standards are meaningless given that we are citizens of the Galactic Alliance and not the Imperial Remnant. My parents are dead, they died during the war between the Kiliks and the Chiss."  Tyria says once she and the doctor are in private.

The doctor pulled out his Meidsensor and scanned the young girl.
"I have to admit, that I have studied countless numbers of life forms in my career, but nothing like you." He glances from his readout to the girl. "I am a doctor, you know".
He puts the medisensor down and sits on the corner of his desk. "You are absolutely amazing. You breathe, you talk, your irises dilate, I would not be surprised if you had the functions to eat, and even perspire."
He looks at the girl for a long hard second. "But your not a human. I would say you were a Droid, but I have never met anything nearly as advanced as you. And your obviously self aware, and sentient."
"You know", he said picking up his sensor and looking at it. "Butler, downstairs, belonged to my Great Uncle. He was placed in his current shell by some of my Cousins, and presented as a joke for my graduation from medical school. However, they failed to wipe his memory."
He looks back at the girl. "He has a sense of self, and the most amazing stories he can tell you from the war. He has been a constant companion to me for these last few years, and I value his thoughts and his insights highly. He is a true friend, and at times a mentor, regardless of whether or not he eats and drinks."
The doctor stands up. "I feel differently about advanced droids that some people. To they are not machines, but carbon based life forms. So I want you to know, that I will keep your secret safe with me. However I need some kind of assurance that your not part of this plot. I figure  you are not, because as advanced as you are, if you were out to kill the Chiss you would have done so by now. It would be reassuring to have some of the truth though."
"But if we plant to keep this a secret, and by all means I do... it may work out for the best for you to come up with some sort of identity records. You may already have them. Perhaps I can figure out from one of the more enrepenurial locals to craft documents of legal guardianship to keep nosy people away. I warn you though, im a brilliant doctor, but a lousy technitian. I lack the skills to work on carbon-based life. Thats where it will get tricky to keep your secret. You will need to stay out of trouble".
The doctor places a kindly hand on the girl's shoulder. "Provided you are kind of heart though, you are welcome to come with"

"It doesn't really matter to me what you think.  If you go around telling people what I am though, that is dangerous to me, and I can't allow that.  Human Replica Droids like me are worth nearly 10 million credits, and people really will do just about anything for money."
"I don't need your help, I'm fine on my own.  I have an identity that my parents made for me, and I am completely capable of taking care of myself.  My parents made sure of that, they didn't want me to die on them like their orginal daughter did.  My records indicate that I am the real Tyria, and that instead of dying during the Yuzhan Vong war I was put into stasis until my injuries could be treated.  After the war, I was brought out of stasis and patched up with prosthetics, which would explain any extreme injuries I recieve."  Tyria said blinking at the hand that was resting on her shoulder.  She rolled her shoulder gently to remove the hand.
"As I said, I am completly self-sufficient, and require no help.  I am just fine on my own."

"Very well", said the doctor holding his hand up and away. "Perhaps I came across as condesending, or over protective. I have a younger sister who you remind me a lot of at her age", he nods. "Minus of course the pink hair. Father would never allow such a thing."
"I am sure that you are aware your outward appearance will induce reactions in people, especially human. I aplogise for falling into that trap. Im dealing with you as if you are a teenage girl, and you are anything but."
"I mean what I said, though about your privacy. Ten million credits is a lot of money for some. For me though, not so much. Ill be happy to pull up my bank account to reassure you."
He holds out his hand. "So please accept my apologies.", he says waiting for her to take it. "If you are alone in the world, what are your plans?"

Wes watched the Dr and the young girl do up the stairs.  *Lets hope he doesn't have other plans for her.  Even if he did she'd probably slice him in half.*  The thought ran through his head as he remembered he effective use of her weapon. 
Looking at the internal chrono in his helmet he realized they had been her at the doctors office a fair amount of time.  They were in a bad place if another attack came.  He walked over to Tam. 
"If we stay much longer we run the risk of another attack.  I suggest that we move to another location as soon as possible as this one is not very defensible.  Perhaps the ship would be a good choice."

"I'm closer to being a teenage girl than not, my personality is the original Tyria's I just have additional skills that she did not.  Where her skill's differ from mine her personality is less apparent since it hadn't shaped the use and responses of the skills, thats changing over time though...I think.  Its not like human momory and personality are a science...or are they?"  Tyria says and then shrugs.
"I'm a teenage girl, I just have the ability to protect myself far beyond a teenagers, that all.  I'm legally an adult anway, I just look younger, its not like all species age the same anyway,  I'm always going to look this young and sexy.  Its a good thing, I'd hate to get old and all droopy."  the pink haired girl says, sounding more like a teenager than a few moments ago.
"I don't have any plans, I was simply going to go along with Tam to find out more about these biodroids to satisfy my curiosity about them since they're sorta like me...and not, or rather they are both."  she says with a shrug.  Turning around she heads back down to the main room.

"Yes. The Mandalorian is corrrrect."  The Jetii said as he looked from Tam and back to him.  "I do not believe I caught your name."  He finished.
Wes watched the Jetii.  *They always act like that know what to do.  I wonder how long it will be till he starts to give orders?*  He thought.
He looked at the Cathar.  "My name was never given since it was never asked for."  The emotionless voice said from the speaker in the helmet.  "But since the Jetii asks for it, my name is Wes Del-Fin."

The doctor watches the girl walk down the steps, his hand still outstreched.
"It was a reasonable series of questions", he thought to himeself. "I am about to invite what appeared to be an underage minor onto my ship. And she is hiding a great secret".
He looks around the room, already packed from Butler's work earlier. "Well at least I am finnaly getting off this rock. Ill drop these people of at Nar Shadar and be on my way", he thought. He smiled with the thought of returning home where his adopted family lived, he might even risk heading over to Miraluka, now that the Empire was all but disolved.
He pulled a pennant off the wall that read "Correlian Medical Academy", his old alma-matter. Carefully rolling it up, he stuffed it in a box and went downstairs.
There he saw the Lionlike Jedi and the Mandalorian in conversation with the Chiss.
"So what time frame do we want to look at moving out? When do we think the parts will arrive?", he asks the crowd.

"Honor to meet you." The he said.  Wes watched the Jetii as he attempted to stare him down.  A chuckle escaped and all heard it.  "Yes Jetii the honor, is all yours."  Wes turned his head to Tam.  "We really should be moving." 
With that Wes moved to the door and took a look around for any trouble.  *This is sure to be an interesting job.*

Tam looked to the Wes and then Sulvar. **"Agreed, this is not a defensible location, and my men can have the parts down to the docking bay in less than 20 galactic standard minutes. Let me just que that up."** Pulling out his personal Holoproject Tam radio's the ship and gives the instructions to have the parts brought down to the Doctor's docking bay.
**"Gunner, if what you require is a copy of the trade agreement, I will make sure you get a copy as soon as it is finalized to be sent back to our prospective governments. As for keeping an eye out, I agree, we should get moving to the docking bay that way we can have the decrpit parts already to be switched over as they arrive.

"Very well. I shall go secure the docking bay. Before you arrive." With that the droid turns and starts walking down the street heading to the docking bay where the doctor's ship waited. He stopped at each person in the office, and looked them over in detail, as if he was adding them to some sort of friend/foe identification system.
From the why he held his heavy repeater, and the hum of his power system, there was little doubt that the docking bay would be clear when the rest of the party arrives.

The marching order doesn't take long to figure out, but you all leave the dr's office headed to the hangar. The street is still a mess from the recent fire fight, many of you find your eyes wandering up above.
As the group walks, as you all chit chat about this or that, a large shadow begins to cover most of the space port, slowly, gradually, covering you. The shape of the shadow is triangular, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out, an imperial Star Destroyer, painted black has decided to come in for a closer look.
Tam, this isn't good. This is the opposite of good as a matter of fact. That ship, right there, belongs to the hand of Thrawn, a sector of the unknown regions that the Grand Admiral took for himself to build up a fighting force, for whatever reason.
The others see a black star destroyer slowly passing over head.

Tam looking up and recognizing the coloration on the star destroyer hollers to the others, **"That Is NOT friendly. I've seen those markings before….RUN! To the Ship Quickly! We'll have to get that ship moving now, whether it's ready to or not."**

"Butler!" the doctor calls, "leave anything that hasnt been sent on already! Float your round rear to the ship now! Double time!."
As the spherical droid emerges from the front room, the doctor grabs it by the underslung claw and begins to sprint behind the others to the ship. He calls on his comlink as he is running. "Hello, Dock control, this is Doctor Krell... yes.. how are you.. im fine.. im glad its cleared up.. yes keep applying the ointment.. look.. im in a bit of a hurry. Can you make sure the Golden Lucre has all of its cargo on board? I sent some containers from my offcie just about an hour ago. Yes.. please, and any other packages or electronics that have been delivered over the past day. Thanks!"

He eyed the dark star destroyer up above through the settlement shield.
"Ive got a bad feeling about this, he thought to himself"

As you all rush to the hanger where your ship is, other people are scrambeling as well. The port's in damn near chaos. The star destroyer continues slowly moving. A loud crunching sound draws your attention, the Star Destroyer has descended so low, it's taking out the holo net relay for the station.  The bottom hangar bay doors open, and hell unfolds.

Gunner charges off in a hail of laser fire from the tie interceptors. The rest of you beeline it toward the ship. ((Durian)) makes it there first, the doors are sealed, and it looks like theres a few wires sticking out of the panneling.
As he makes it there,Wes, you take up cover every chance you get. From what you can see the ship is a bit scrambeled, IE, wires out from the ramp controls, and a few panels from the port side are missing.  Tyria is doing an impressive display of jumping clear of the fire.
As you all run and cover, the Dr is left behind. Most of you, minus Gunner and the good dr, are at the ship. The tie's look to be engaged with several ships above and have stopped firing around you.

Tyria works out a few choice words, and begins crossing some wires here and there. Tam rips off the control panel, and Tyria goes to work. Wes comes over and does a quick scan with his eyes, he points out some fused wiring as well as some key pad buttons that are fizzeled.
With some time, you manage to get the system working. The loading ramp drops with "K-thunk" noise. It would appear the hydraulics on the door lift are..well.. damaged.
The scream of ties fill all of your ears, the Jedi, standing sentry, looks to see several ties on an intercept course, laser fire hitting the ground around him. With a dodge and a quick move he side steps most of them.

Gunner, your ship is intact. Everything seems to be in working order. Until a tie fighter came crashing down into the hanger, smashing into your fighter. It might fly? With a quick repair, but last time you checked, there was an imperial star destroyer over head.
The group at the dr's ship make it inside. The place is a mess, the ship is in pieces. Looks like the repair crew had a few spare parts. Tyria scans the room quickly and throws out  a few more curse words. She's going to have to be creative to get the ship into hyper space.

Gunner and his fighter lift off after being tweaked and prodded as well. As the fighter rises, the cruiser rises. The shadow of the star destroyer looming over both ships.
As the fighter and freighter rise, several other ships do the same, green laser blasts are seen bouncing off the destroyer as the smugglers form a meager defense against horrible odds.

Tam Keys the Comm, "Ok Sit Down and Strap In, cause this is going to be a bumpy ride. And some body lock down that stabalizer in engineering, its giving me a hell of a time with the controls over here."
With that Tam starts to manuever the ship out of the atmosphere streaking past a few dog fighting enemy fights he pulls the trigger on the main auto cannons to blast at a few of the passing TIE fighters.

with his starfighter safely docked, Gunner climbs out of it, and drops onto the deck with a clunk sound. "I understand." He replies to Tam in the cockpit, and heads directly towards engineering. Once there he immediately starts to attempt the needed repairs.

So who hired Jawa's as a repair crew? Is there anything I can do?

Repairs are made to the repulsors, and the hyperdrive is fixed for the most part anyway. The ship lurches through the sky as ties skim the ship, laser bolts blasting around it. The ship hits the black, and you see several star destroyers, in different colors, and several gun ships all hanging siliently in space. Several other smuggler ships escaped the planet as well.
After a quiet that seems to last forever, you clear the system's gravity well. The only question is, where to now?

I think we need to hit a repair place before we go anywhere else. A reliable ship is important.

Tam fights with the controls a bit as the ship clears the atmosphere.
Struck by the varied colored star destroyers, he keys in the shortest coordinates for Nar Shadaa.
Flipping a few buttons and slapping the navi computer so it boots up properly Tam hopes his calculations are correct.

The ship entered hyperspace but none of them knew for how long. The hyperdrive was rigged and it could give out at any time. Wes made his way to the cockpit. Wondering what they were going to do now. He leaned up against the bulkhead.

The droid comes out of the engine section, and comes to the bridge. He doesn't wait for permission before settling into the co-pilot's seat. "First we need to properly assess the damage to the ship. After this has been done, we can determine if continued travel to Nar Shadda is acceptable, or if a detour is needed."

"I'll take a look around the ship and see what we are dealing with stores wise. With the way this ship was treated by the so called mechanics I suspect we are lacking in stores as theft of other equipment is likely."
Starts checking all the rooms to assess what we are dealing with stores wise.
