# [Heart Of Shadows] Chapter 3 (Woroken's shopping)

Ordenn looks at Woroken and smiles.
Ordenn: "Oh, I didn't think you would have survived. I almost felt like I saw a ghost. I left a good hour or two before the whole incident. What's going on?"

Woro: "We barely survived. It was through blind luck, I have no doubt. I am Woroken, by the way. I broke my spear during the escape, and heard that Weebus is the best in the area at doing repairs. What are you doing in these parts...I think I last saw you talking to either Rith or Radon?" Woroken pays particular attention to her response or lack thereof at the mention of Radon's name.

Ordenn frowns.
Ordenn: "Yes, I was talking to them. Do you know where they went? Weebus is excellent for any of your mechanical needs. I'm here to sell some commodities. I stopped at the Telares station for a rest."

Woro: "Ordenn, when you complete your business here, could I speak to you in private for a moment? I won't take much of your time, and I could compensate you for it."

Ordenn seems to be interested, she motions a thank you to Weebus.
Ordenn: "I've finished my order, let's step outside."
Ordenn steps outside the shop.

Woroken follows Ordenn out of the shop into the blazing Tatooine heat. Not being the greatest diplomat in the world, the big wookiee, after looking both ways to be sure they could not be over heard *perception +7*, asks the following: "Ordenn, did anyone approach you on the station about booking passage planetside? A humanoid friend of mine named Orwen was looking for a ride and I wondered if he might have contacted you. Secondly, I don't suppose you have seen the podracer Radon this afternoon? He survived teh crash as well, but ended up missing when we awoke this morning. I know you were acquaintances, and. was thinking he might have contacted you"

*Woroken's perception 7+14=21.*
Woroken can see people walking past the small hut of a shop with no interest in what he is saying. He looks around at the other buildings, and no one seems to be paying attention.
Ordenn: "Why yes someone did, a fellow named Orwen. He looked broke but he had more than enough credits to pay me for the fare. As far as Radon goes, he contacted me once saying he was going to be in the podrace...saying that I should check out his pilot ability. Sadly, I won't be here much longer."

Woro: "Ordenn, I don't suppose you could tell me where Orwen is currently, could you? He is the exact person I was looking for. I figured Radon would try to get into the upcoming race. Did you speak with him today? Finally, and this is a purely personal question so feel free to tell me to mind my business, but could I ask where you are heading in such an obvious rush? Anything I Could help you with?"

Ordenn responds coolly.
Ordenn: "Well there is a Remnant ship in orbit, I don't want to be anywhere near that thing. Sometimes they interfere with my operations, and they might end up in this settlement. As far as Radon, I haven't heard from him since yesterday. But Orwen, he wouldn't tell me where he was going and we went separate ways as soon we left the hangar. "

"Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me, Ordenn. I appreciate it very much. Take this for your time, and if you ever need anything let me know." The wookiee passes Ordenn 100 of the truguts he had received for the rifles. He also gives her his comlink frequency in case she needed it in the future.
He switches his comlink back to the ON position, to determine the current status of Red Team. Woro then begins heading back to the Jedi quarters, as he did not want to give out the info about Rast actually making it planetside, over the com.

Ordenn declines the truguts and bids Woroken farewell.
