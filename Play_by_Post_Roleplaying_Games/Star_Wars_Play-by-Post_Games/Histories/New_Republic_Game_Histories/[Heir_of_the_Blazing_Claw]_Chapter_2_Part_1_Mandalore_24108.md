# [Heir of the Blazing Claw] Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-05-16 19:42:25)

Two weeks have passed since the battle to take the Mobile Spacedock away from the scavengers. With the droids pacified: Nadia, Lorcan, Sulvar and Kalor have been able to make themselves comfortable aboard the *Frylla's Gold*. And they're personal effect have been transferred over from the *Hope Fades* Along with a small prize crew, made of a mix of the scavengers that have joined the pirates, and some of the veterans. Lana Stormsender had come over as well, taking command of the ship. And the place no longer feels as abandoned as it had been when you came aboard.
Captain Dosha Gemthrine's holographic representation stands in the middle of the conference room table. With Lana, along with Nadia, Lorcan, Sulvar, and Kalor waiting for his announcement.
"Greetings, I hope things are going well. It appears that we are on our way to putting together a small fleet already." Dosha's hologram opens the conversation.
"Yes, Captain." Lana replies. "We have restored the hyperdrive along with main power, But we'll need a true shipyard to bring the Gold up to one hundred percent."
"That is good. I've made arrangements to have *Frylla's Gold* restored at the Mandalmotors shipyard. Your to proceeded to the Mandalore System. You'll also be transporting the Citadel we captured, and it will also be repaired there."

Nadia had been half listening to the conversation between the captain and Lana, but when the words MandalMotors and Manalore popped up in the conversation her attention immediately turned to the topic. Mentally she sighed, *I had not planned on going back so soon. Fate must be laughing about now.*

Lorcan looked around not really caring about what was going on. He wanted to go back to fine tuning his ship or taking pop shots at the droid heads he had propped up in the hanger. However as soon as he heard the name of the system they were heading to his eyes widened and he almost dropped the blaster rifle he was holding in one hand **"Haar'chak"** he muttered to himself *This is not good, maybe I can fly on patrol or something like that. Then again with a ship this big I just find my own little private room* he thought.
As different thoughts raced through his mind Sparky looked over at Lorcan and beeped a few time almost waiting for a response. After not getting one he beeped a few more time and rocked back and forth. Finely he turned to face Lorcan and opened up a slot pulling out a tool appendage with two prongs on the end. As he moved it closer to Lorcan a current of electricity jumped from one prong to the other. He moved it forward pushing it into Lorcans' right leg. For a second nothing happened then Lorcan yelled out in pain as he jumped to the left **"You little beskar'ad I should kyr'amur you and send you straight to haran so you can hettir for the rest of eternity!!**" he yelled rubbing his leg

Sulvar looks at Lorcan "Is there something we should know? Your droid is behaving...odd."

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-16 21:23:43)

"Odd?? No he's normally like this. It would be odd if he just left me alone." he said rubbing his leg "Ok if I'm not needed I'm going to go work on my can'gal."

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-17 14:33:55)

Nadia watched Lorcan carefully. For someone who wanted to be known for himself and not where he came from he was certainly making it hard not to realize his origins. If Lorcan continued to carry on like this it would only be a matter of time, especially with them heading to Mandalore.
Nadia sighed audibly. The time on Mandalore was probably going to be rather interesting, especially with the aruetiise going. Maybe with luck neither she or Lorcan would have to go anywhere near it.

"**Mandalore, eh? Excellent. Great opportunity to learn some Mandalorian,**" announces Kalor, with a half-smile. "**If only to figure out what you two ramble on about half the time.**"
"**Blue milk run, then? Good, gives me some time to work on a few things. Lana, we still need to have that talk.**"

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-17 17:11:27)

Nadia looked over at Kalor. **"I would be cautious if you plan to head down to the planet. Since the Empire was driven off the planet, aruetiise, that is to say outsiders, are treated with suspicion."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-17 20:04:40)

Lorcan looked at Kalor **"Did you ever get the idea that maybe I don't want you to know what I'm talking about you di'kut."** Lorcan looked back at Sparky **"You do that again and I'll shot you out an airlock."** Sparky pulled his tool appendage back in and beeped once again. **"Look we both know I don't know what you're saying unless I have a computer to translate."** he snapped as Sparky beeped a few more time **"Ugh!! Forget this! Can someone get me a translator and send it down to the hanger."** he said storming off to his ship

Sulvar shrugs... "At least tell us enough to not piss off the mandalorians. I know nothing of the mandalorians and I do not want to put my foot in my mouth as it were."

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-05-18 08:20:28)

Lana smiled, and managed to avoid giggling during Lorcan's outburst letting the group have their conversation without interrupting. Finally Lorcan storms off back to the hanger. "I need to discuss some things with the captain yet, but your dismissed."
(Now's as good a time as any. You've received 5000 credits as payment for your services so far. and anything you want to do aboard the ship. Now's the time.)

"**You've just described every single-species settlement from Ryloth to Nelvaan,**" replies Haden, before adding with a smile, "**Never stopped me from..(he clears his throat)..making *encounters* before.**"
He looks over at the door Lorcan and the astromech left out of. "**I take it they were all out of vocabulators? Well, since we won't be making a stop over the E-District of Nar Shadaa any time soon, I think I'm going to have some alone time.**"
"**Catch up on a few things.**"
With nothing but a momentary brow-lift, Kalor leaves the conference room, seeking out an abandoned room.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-18 11:18:17)

Nadia was about to respond to Sulvar when Lana dismissed them. Bowing to her slightly she made her way toward the door, following the others. **"I'll be happy to give you a crash course on our… etiquette,"** she directed at Sulvar as she left, heading for the hanger bay.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-05-19 19:27:36)

Nadia and Sulvar go off to conduct a quick course of Mandalorian Etiquette. While Lorcan goes down to the hanger, a laughing R2-R trailing behind. Kalor goes off in search of somewhere to have a private moment. Meanwhile, Lana and Dosha continue to speak.
((Now is the time to do anything you want to do before moving on.))

Kalor spends a few hours in "training", the bantha-Jedi's equivalent of waving around a lightsaber like a madman and somehow avoid whopping his own head off.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-20 16:45:13)

Lorcan walked down to the hanger looking at the package of things he had bought with his money. He worked on attaching the stun baton to his rifle and made sure everything was working.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-21 10:49:52)

Nadia had pocketed the money, saving it for when she found a need for it. After teaching Sulvar the finer points to "Mandalorian etiquette" she went to find a sparring partner to practice her martial arts.
In the process she comes across Kalor, unsuccessfully attempting to remaster the blade. **"You better be careful or you're going to hurt someone."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-21 14:53:43)

Kalor looks quite distraught as someone disturbs his solace, but seeing Nadia, he relaxes a little - if anyone could help him with his little dilemma, she could. Or the Cathar.
"**I think you overestimate my chances,**" he replies with a smile, as the blade retracts into the hilt. "**Just like knowing a little Echani, just having this thing on me has saved me more fights than I can count.**"
"**But sometimes, when it really counts, I could do some pretty darn sweet things with this. Saved my life more than once.**"
His smile widening, he adds, "**Should've seen the look on your face when you saw this on me the first time.**"

### **Alicia** (2009-05-25 00:36:22)

**"It was more the shock of seeing Pops' ghost and learning you were his son. After that, learning you had a lightsaber was not so surprising."** Nadia approached closer, setting her helmet down out of the way of any sparring they would do. **"I think you were more shocked to see mine."**
Taking a look around she pulled out the heirloom lightsaber and activated it. **"Your stance is clumsy, you're more likely to cut off your own foot than hit your target or be able to defend yourself."** Standing in front of Kalor she took a defensive stance.

"**I do better when I don't think about it.**"
Kalor watches as Nadia draws her own. "**Oh, you want to go? Now?**" He asks, a smile growing on his face. "**Alright, let's see if I can still do this. Heads up.**"
Taking the first offense, the once-Jedi attacks, swinging his father's lightsaber downwards from the shoulder, following through with a wide swing as Nadia dodges out of the way, ending up behind him.
"**Hey, stay put…wai!**"
Jumping out of the way, just in time, he evades a blow, but isn't quite as lucky with the following attack, which knocks him straight to the ground.
Helpless, he watches as the Mandalorian attacker follows through with a finishing blow. Drawing instinctively from the Force, he finds the clarity of mind to intercept the the impending attack with his own blade, taking the momentary reprieve to push back the assailant, forcing her to stagger back as he acrobatically getting back onto his feet.
The Mandalorian presses the attack, and the bounty hunter skillfully blocks the charge. The two's blades interlock as each tries to push his opponent back.

Suddenly there was a lurch, as the ship started to make its way to the hyperlimit. And a few minutes latter, it lurched again as it entered Lightspeed.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-27 12:58:58)

Nadia looked around suddenly distracted. **"I think we jumped into the system."** She jumped back disengaging herself from the lock. **"You fight well. We will have to do this again."** Bowing to him she deactivated her lightsaber and headed toward her helmet. With her back turned to Kalor, he couldn't see her expression as she contemplated her return to Mandalore. *I wonder for how long I can delay a visit to the surface.* Not bothering to put the lightsaber back into its compartment she clipped it to her belt and held her helmet under her arm.
Looking back at Kalor she said simply. **"I'm heading to the hanger deck."**

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-27 14:42:45)

Lorcan felt the ship jump to hyperspace and a chill ran up his spine *Ok now that everything is working I guess I'll look around the ship for a good place to 'practice' my stealth skill* he thought as he looked around. He glanced at Sparky and narrowed his eye **"I'm going to have to do something about you. Other wise you're going to be nothing short of a headache."** Lorcan continue to look around thinking of what to do with Sparky

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-05-27 15:32:28)

Sparky beeped in merriment, and spent a few moments moving in circles around Lorcan as if taunting him to do something.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-27 17:00:37)

Lorcan glared at sparky **"How did I get stuck with such an annoying droid?"** he asked himself **"What's bad is I can't even have you reprogrammed."** he sighed as he walked up to his ship, pushed himself up and sat on the edge.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-29 22:21:26)

Nadia entered the hanger deck, her helmet held under one arm and saw Lorcan. She approached him, examining their surroundings. **"You need to make a decision, vod'ika. I doubt either of us can hide here forever."** *Especially me as they will probably send me down as a feirfek tour guide.* **"Eventually we're going to find ourselves on the planet."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-30 16:45:25)

Lorcan looked at Nadia as she walked up **"You may have to worry but I don't. I just need to find something to do with Sparky here and I'll be fine. No one here, but you, knows my real name, and no one back home knows that I go by Lorcan now."** He looked back at Sparky and sighed **"Oh I can also keep my helmet on so no one will recognize me."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-30 17:12:51)

Nadia looks at him. **"Your helmet may hide your face, but if you're family is close they will know who you are. They know you're alive… why not see them? Are you really that ashamed of where you come from you would deny your family the joy in having you back?"**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-30 17:45:28)

**"I'm not ashamed of what I've become, but it's not my opinion that counts now is it?"** he asked jumping down form the ship **"I'm sure the whole family would *love* to hear how I pretty much turned my back on everything they tried to teach me and became a pirate. Yeah that's just overflowing with pride. Hell no one even knows who I am in this ship let alone anywhere else…unlike my brother and sister. I'm sure plenty of people have heard of them."** he said with a sigh **"Look I was the only child not in tune with the force and the only thing I was ever good at was shooting a gun. Oh look I'm just like every other foot solider. I'm not the type of kid who makes a parent proud. Better for them to think I died in some battle rather than be disappointed in what I've become."** Lorcan looked down at the ground for a moment muttering something under his breath as he shook his head before he looked up again **"If it happens…it happens, but I don't think I'll be getting a warm welcome."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-31 10:39:41)

Nadia balled up her fists, resisting the urge to knock some sense into him. **"They aren't going to care what you've been. They don't care you haven't a trace of the sensitivity to the Force as the rest of your family. Do you think that is all they care about?"** Her voice was slowly growing in volume as her temper continued to flare. **"If that is how you feel, then you have no business calling yourself mando'ade."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-31 13:26:47)

Lorcan looked at Nadia **"You know what…I never called myself that. I know I'm not a mando'ade. I've walked too far away from that life to ever be accepted back. I know that my family will want to see me, but then I have to deal with the clan. I was never liked much as a kid, so I'm sure there are plenty of people who would love to see me kicked out of the clan and I'm not going to bring that dishonor to my family."** He looked down at Sparky for a moment and sighed **"You seem to think that I've been away all this time just cause I was out having fun….well you're wrong. So go ahead and hit if you want."**  he said looking back at Nadia **"but don't question my life."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-31 13:37:46)

Nadia took a calming breath, losing her temper wouldn't solve anything. **"Do you remember what cin vhetin is?"** She watched looking for sign of recognition of what it is. **"It could be yours, and nothing in the past would matter. All you would have to do is accept your heritage. That choice is yours. A fresh start, a clean slate."** She left the words hanging for a moment before she turned and walked away.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-31 13:46:20)

Lorcan thought for a moment and then let out a small laugh **"Shows how long I've been away."** he said as he looked back at his ship **"Well I'm still a pirate, that won't change, but I'm sure this will help. Who know I might get some equipment out of it. Now how to approach mom and dad…"**

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-05-31 16:09:38)

The Journey to Mandalore was relatively quiet, with the engines catching fire only once, forcing them to move slower then the class .75 hyperdrive would normally allow. When you finally reach the system. your challenged by the sight of the Mandalmotors shipyard, and the series of capital ships protecting them. The *Frylla's Gold*  is challenged by a ship who's transponder identifies it as the *Canderous*
"This is Captain Eron of the Manda'a Warship *Canderous* State your business in our system."

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-31 16:39:39)

As soon as Lorcan heard the name of the Captain he sighed **"Well that didn't take long."** he said as he started walking towards the bridge *So brother you have your own ship now eh. Well this should prove to be most interesting* he thought as he let out a small laugh and flipped on his comm to Lana's channel **"Lana I know you wouldn't think of me when it come to dealing with people without shooting them, but let me talk to this guy. If things go bad you can dump off where you want and keep all my stuff."**

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-05-31 16:44:35)

Nadia stood on the brigde she wasn't as surprised by the revelation as Lorcan was. She glanced over at Lana, **"If it will make you feel better I can keep an eye on Lorcan to make sure he doesn't cause trouble."** Nadia doubted he would, but who knew how Eron would react.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-05-31 16:46:49)

"By all mean!" Lana replied, She clearly had little experience dealing with Mandalorians and Nadia was clearly better suited to speaking on they're behalf.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-05-31 19:07:35)

Lorcan quickly made his way up to the bridge and opened the comm channel with a smile **"Captain Eron, this is Commander Lorcan of the *Frylla's Gold*. We are in need of your…superior skills. The ship we are on is in need of some major repairs. However we do not have the resources to repair it ourselves. So do we have the ok to go? If not then would just do this favor for your ika-vod?"**

It wasn't easy to tell Eron's expression do to his *buy'ce* he seemed to think about the request. "You know some of our language *aruetii*. You'll have to work out the details with Control. But you do seem familiar to me Commander Lorcan. Have we met?"

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-06-02 14:30:57)

Lorcan continued to smile **"That's not important right now. If you really want to then then you can meet me in person and we can talk about it more then. Other wise if you would be so kind as to tell us were to park we'll be on our way."** Lorcan turned to Lana and winked **"Just tell the crew where to put her down if you want I can head over to your ship in my fighter."**

Nadia watched the exchange ready to jump in should Lorcan push his brother a bit too far before revealing who he was. She understood Lorcan didn't want the others to know and would keep quiet till then. When the communique was over she was still watching Lorcan.
**"Well then… let's meet with Captain Eron."** Once the others were ready so would head with them to the hanger bay to meet with the Mandalorian boarding party.

It didn't take long for a Lambda-class shuttle to come in for a landing aboard the larger ship, using the hanger. Lorcan, Nadia, Lana and Sulvar remain a safe distance away the loading ramp opens. Eron is wearing black *Beskar'gam* and he's followed by a half dozen other Mandalorians carrying enough weapons to stop a riot. Trotting along in Eron's wake is a Strill.
He spots Lorcan, then turns and sees Nadia. The Captain immediately turns and walks towards her. "So your still alive Nad'ika."

You've spoken to Lorcan already and this is Sulvar."**

A rather unwoven looking man, makes his way into the hangar as he quickly dons a large black overcoat. He grins at Eron's large and rather intimidating suit of familiar armor, "**Oh, shiny**" he exclaims dryly, before nudging Suvlar. "**So? Mandalore? What'd I miss?**"

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Vash** (2009-06-03 15:14:39)

Lorcan looked at all the Mandalorians and sighed *Why the frak does he always have to show off?* he thought as he started getting annoyed at the big show Eron was putting on. He glanced at Eron's armor and rolled his eyes at Kalors' remark before walking past the group over to his own fighter and began working on a few minor things to make sure his ship was in top shape.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-06-03 16:09:23)

"Captain." Eron says nodding to Lana, before turning his attention back to Nadia. "You know the older ways of the Mando'ade. I decided I wanted to be captain."
In the older ways of the Mandalorians, if you wanted a specific position, you simply showed up there, and proved you where better qualified then the current person in that position. Then his attention turns to Lorcan who attempted to walk off. The Mando Captain walked over to the Aethersprite, and put a hand on the other man's shoulder. "So it is you, Ner'Vod."

Kalor rolled his eyes as Eron pursues Lorcan. "**Someone's got a crush,**" he whispers in a sing-song voice.
"**Any chance we can move this along?**" he asks, louder, eying the armed escort warily. "**I'm feeling…underdressed.**"

Lorcan looked over his shoulder **"You must be Eron."** He slid Erons' hand off and went back to working in the fighter. He continued to work for a few seconds before he held his hand out **"Hey why don't you make yourself useful and hand me that laser welder."** Before Eron could hand him the tool Lorcan pulled himself out and looked up at him, still with his helmet on **"I'm surprised you know who I am. It's only been thirteen years."** he said wiping his hands off

Eron takes off his helmet, and clips it to his belt. "Your my brother, Dar'ika. I wouldn't forget you." With that the captain gives Lorcan a manly embrace, and drags him to his feet. "Leave the *jesiti* fighter be. and we'll have to get you into some proper *beskar'ga*"

Nadia watched Lorcan and Eron, a slim smile playing on her lips. She knew it wouldn't take much for Lorcan's family to recognize him, with or without his helmet on. To Sulvar she whispered **"I doubt Eron would kill his wayward brother. If their mother learned of it she would be on a rampage."** She moved to approach Lorcan and Eron.
She spoke to him quickly and decisively in Mando'a.

Eron nods, replacing his helmet he apparently sends a transmission to his ship over his helmet comlink. Then he turns and addresses his escort, some of which go back into the ship.
Suddenly the hanger deck is flooded with a foul smelling musk, as the Strill marks the Aethersprite as part of its territory. With a blip of dismay, Sparky goes up to the beast shock prod extended and zaps the creature, who promptly leaps at the droid knocking it over, and attempts to bite it.
"Ard'ika, leave the droid alone." Eron calls out, sounding amused. The Strill then walks over and and stands beside the Mandalorian Captain.

"I see, The Mandalmotors Tower will guide you into a slip then." Eron replied, Clearly unconcerned about the droid. "Ard'ika, back aboard the ship. You know Dar'ika, Lae'ika will be eager to see you. As with *buir*, Are you sure you won't want the beskar'gam?"
Turning to Nadia, he stepped close to her, and gently touched his helmet against her forehead. "Its good to see you again Nad'ika, Your of course welcome to visit."

Nadia leaned in slightly to return the gesture. As she wasn't wearing her helmet like Eron she didn't tap as hard. "**I would hope so, Celena'buir promised me a dinner and I'm sure Erdan'buir will want to give me a lecture for taking off like I did.**" Nadia rolled her eyes at the thought. She didn't even want to think about what her own father would do when she showed up a the family *yaim*. When Lorcan said he would accept the armor she nodded in approval. She guess he still wasn't enthused about accepting his legacy, but at least he was trying. After a moment she asked "**Is my sister still maintaining my family's *yaim*?**"

"**Well.

"He only answer "*Aay'han*"" Eron replied, Taking a deep breath he turned to Lana. "Everything seems on the level. Thank you for your patience." Then he returns to his shuttle with the rest of the men and begin to depart Himself.
Lana Stormsender, walks over to Nadia and Lorcan. "Well, this must be a homecoming for the two of you. By all means go spend some time with your family. I'll get everything wrapped up here for the repairs. Just don't do anything to get us thrown out of the system, okay?"

Nadia was distracted from the message Eron had left with her. After a moment she looked over at Lana. "**You have nothing to worry about.**" Turning she headed for her NovaSword and looked over at Kalor. "**Want a ride?**"
Lee had been doing a fantastic job of maintaining the fighter, but she knew his help was probably going to be needed for the repair work of the *Gold*. It wasn't like she was expecting to get into a space combat anytime soon either.

Kalor frowns at Nadia's offering, having witnessed her interactions with her new, fond and efficient co-pilot. Nevertheless, she was offering.
"**Just like old times,**" he replies. "**I'll take you up on that. I think that Nova's starting to grow on me.**"
"**Keep her over dry land though,**" he adds with a smile.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

Kalor sees her smile before she secures her helmet and gets into the cockpit of the fighter. "**I'm sure I can do that. The closest body of water where we are going is a lake.**" Starting up the pre-flight checks she waits for Kalor to get in before securing the cockpit. Frowning she tries to decide who she wants to see first: her family or the Sarkin's. Though considering how close the two families lived they might be seen at the same time.
Nadia turned her head to look at Kalor. "**Ready? Your about to meet all my relations.**" With his go ahead she launches the fighter, entering the atmosphere and heading towards the outskirts of Enceri where her family's farm is.

Daro watched as the others left and waited for Sparky to lock himself in. As soon as he was ready he sighed and looked at the other fighters giving them plenty of time to put some distance between them and his fighter *Well he goes nothing* he thought as he barely lifted the fighter off the deck. The fighter hovered for a second or two as the landing gear folded up into the body, They without warning he opened the throttle up and pushed the fighter to it's limits. He turned the the agile ship so it made a wide ark around the others and raced towards the planet.
As he raced towards the planet he glanced back at the other fighters as Sparky began beeping something **"Nope, I have no idea where I am going. I'm just going down to look at the planet before I get taken hostage by my aliit."**

Nadia maneuver's her fighter toward where she remember the farm to be. From this height all that can be see are trees and more trees in the direction she is heading. Taking the fighter lower she heads for a small clearing which appears to be naturally made some distance from a settlement. Stretching in one direction is a section of cleared land, which can be discerned from closer inspection to be farm land. For a moment she allows the fighter to hover as she makes a quick check of the descent before lowering the gear and descending easily into the clearing making sure to leave room for either Sulvar or Lorcan to land. She would have to move one of the fighters out of the clearing to make room for the other.
"**See, I didn't land us in any water.**" Nadia teased, beginning to shut down systems. "**I'm going to need your help moving the ship off the pad.**" Opening the canopy she climbed out of the cockpit. Not far away she could see the dim light coming from the slit windows of the yaimi. Half hidden by the forest, the circular building was half submerged into the ground. The grassed roof acting to camouflage the dwelling from the air. She could also hear the sounds of children shouting out over their arrival. She paused for a moment distracted by the sound. "**It's so nice to hear children laughing here once again**," She said more to herself than anyone. Shaking her head she motioned Kalor over to move the ship with the help of a several repulsor lifts off the pad so the other fighter could land.

As the NovaSword's cockpit shield receded, Kalor hopped out of the co-pilot seat and dropped to the ground. Closing his eyes, he takes a long, deep breath. He extends his arms outwards, enjoying the natural wonder of Mandalore.
"**It's been a while,**" he explains, moving around the ship and helping Nadia move it off the landing pad. "**It's always planet-wide city, desert, volcanoes or ocean.**"
"**Would it kill a bounty to make a stop over Dantooine every once in a while?**"

Nadia laughed, "**Storn, my father, shared the same sentiments. This place became his refuge, more so when he brought my mother and I here to live.**" With Kalor's help they quickly got the fighter hidden into the trees making room for both Sulvar and Lorcan's own fighters. From a nearby bin she pulled out a net to camouflage the NovaSword.

Nadia nodded still listening to the sounds coming from the house. "**Yes, it's so they won't be spotted from the air. We'll need to move them off the pad.**" With her NovaSword secured she took off her helmet and like her companions took in the large breath of the fresh air. "**I'm not sure who's here and I doubt you want someone to land on your X-wing.**" Wiping her brow with the back of her hand she moved to help move the X-wing into the forest and cover it.

Daro flew around looking at the planet that he started his life on. He had noticed a few things from when he had grow up and even did a fly by of the capital. As he continued to fly around he spotted the X-wing landing and figured that's where the others were. He turned wide and flew his fighter in just above trees as he approached the clearing. Just as he approached the clearing he hit the brakes as hard as he could before hovering for a few seconds to make sure no one was under him. He slowly put the fighter down, then whit Sparkys' help piloted the small fighter into the trees.
Daro opened the hatch and jumped out **"Well this should be fun."** he said as he looked back at the ship **"Ok lets go.. Sparks watch the ship for me please."**

He looked froward again as he walked muttering something under his breath in Mando'a. He took a breath and relaxed his shoulders **"When you're off somewhere fighting every day just to live keeping your good looks tends to slip your mind.

"**Everyone else is likely married with a brood of children of their own.**"

With the Roar of the Starfighters coming into land, the whole family comes out of the yaim to watch the X-wing, NovaSword, and Aethersprite come and land. Nadia and Eron quickly identify Ka'ra and the small cluster of children gathered around her legs.
When she sees, Her sister, Ka'ra dashes towards her, throwing her arms out and embracing Nadia despite the armored plates she was wearing. The older children were all more interested in the machines that had come to visit them, and one, A boy about 16, makes a run directly towards the X-wing, "This is so cool!"
"Vau, Go get on the comlink, and signal Van and Krad. Tell them Nadia is home." Ka'ra replies beaming, finally stepping back. "So who are your friends?"
As Daro approaches the door, some of the other children draw what appear to be blasters, and start to fire at him. However they are only toy weapons, and even the best aimed spark only manages to land about in front of his boots.

As the HUD powered up the sniper rifle on his shoulder unlocked and he rolled so he was flat on the ground, he quickly switched the rife to stun mode and began firing shots over the kids heads making sure he wouldn't hit anyone.

As though doubly indicated, the bounty hunter was as much interested in the reunited family as they were interested in him. Instead, he wandered the clearing, taking in the natural beauty of the forest. Though never intending to visit them, in his mind, he was already plotting a course to the nearest landmarks; a nearby overlook, or even the lake.

The children scream and run back inside the compound. Giving Daro a small moment to take in his apparent victory. Suddenly a few of the kids return, wearing *beskar'gam* and followed by what could only be a Power Droid with an E-web heavy repeater that someone has attached to it. One child has to sit on the shoulders of another, to reach the controls, but soon they are returning fire...
"Its So nice of Daro, to play with the children." Ka'ra replies with a smile, She turns and greets Kalor and Sulvar, apparently oblivious to the war of escalation going on behind her. "Yes Ven and Krad are still working together, thankfully they've managed to keep each other alive long enough to return home.
The six-teen year old, was the Vau Ka'ra adressed Earlier. "I'll be back. Thank you for the offer." He said greatful of the offer, but regretting that it had to wait. But he exchanges some harsh words with the others vod'ika and went inside.
Kalor, notices that this is Mandalore, and that almost everything is carnivorous. Most of the animals wouldn't come closer to the Yaim then nessessary especially with the noisy approach of the fighters and now the blasters.

Nadia glances at the children watching Vau head inside. She smiled as they began putting on ill fitting plates of armor. "**Eron wasn't joking when he said I had more nieces and nephews at last count. Is Vau one of ours?**" Ours meaning a member of their ever growing family. He was rather old to have been adopted without having proven himself to the family. With that thought she looked at the other children, trying to distinguish which ones she remembered. She saw Mira, five years old now watching the twin boys set up the E-web, cheering them on. Out of the five children she had seen, Mira was the only one Nadia clearly remembered though she was now of course a few years older. The twin boys she knew were Ven's adopted sons.

Ka'ra curses, and shouts to the kids, who promptly disappear into the house taking the droid/weapon with them.
"Just act normal!" Ka'ra insists, as the shuttle settles down, and a squad of stormtroopers disembark with they're commanding officer. The immediately take interest in the Aethersprite and X-wing, and a pair of troopers walk over to inspect each fighter.
"So these are the fighters, that forgot to radio in they're flight plans to the Garrison? I'd greatly like to speak with their pilots." The officer calls out to no one in particular. "As they're all about to be confiscated."

Nadia glared at the Imperials. Hadn't they gotten rid of the Imperials once and for all soon after the Battle of the City of Bones. Where all those sacrifices for nothing? She was filled with sorrow for a split second as her thoughts turned to Korbin. *My sweet ad'ika*. Her expression turned deadly as she gazed at the Imperial bullies and then she forced herself into a calm. Not willing to be bullied by any Imperial remnant scum, she stepped forward. "**We don't need permission to land on OUR planet. It's the other way around. Consider YOUR ships confiscated for the glory of our fleet.**"

Daro stopped *playing* as he heard the TIEs fly over head. He sighed as was about to stand up when he noticed the officer and heard Ka'ra say act normal. A smile formed on his face as he kept his rifle set to stun. He carefully took aim on the officer. He thought for a second on if he should shoot the officer or not. As soon as he heard the the fighters were going to be confiscated his mind was made up. He took aim again carefully lining up the HUDs cross-hairs on the officer **"Like hell you're going to touch my ship."** he whispered to himself as he squeezed the trigger

For most men in the universe, *Alliance*, *Rebellion* and *Empire* were words reiterating a painful truth. When it came down to the day's labor, it didn't matter who was ruling the galaxy. No matter who it were, chances are they were doing a good job. Idealists would preach of rights, democracies and laws, but all a common man truly wanted was some peace of mind.
Kalor didn't mind the Empire as much as most. Sure, under the rule of Palpatine, and as nothing but a child, he was hunted, persecuted and forced into a life of crime, but it did not instill a defining hate. The galaxy was a big place to hide for a young man with little perceptible Force prowess and few remaining ties to the Jedi. On the other hand, in the long run, the Clone Wars did more good than bad. Local governates were consolidated, laws were upheld, and peace was kept. Fear itself made the galaxy step in line.
The growing Rebellion, on the other hand, did nothing but bring chaos into the mix. With the Empire divided, autonomy was lost and power suddenly became subject to abuse with no consequence. At the end of the day, only the common man suffers the burden of war.
Watching quietly as the Imperial shuttle lands nearby, Kalor knew enough to tell they weren't here to do them any favors. While once his most reliable once-employer, he suspected the day would come when he would exchange blaster bolts with the men in white. The incident on Point Nadir probably didn't help - had that officer survived, he would have filed an alert with Kalor's details, probably detailing theft, bounty-hunting and intent-to-murder. Crimes by the law, but still the dabbles of the Empire. Nobody liked to give away credits they didn't have to.
Kalor listened carefully as the officer said his words, and could already sense the anger rise inside Nadia, while Lorcan, the quick-draw, already had his hands on his rifle. Nadia replied and the bounty-hunter's eyes widened, a growing concern for the nearby, frightened, young, mother and the children inside the home. Quickly, he steps forwards, arms outstretched, stepping between the Mandalorians and the Imperials, trying to talk over Nadia while trying to gesture Lorcan to stand down.
"**They're my ships. I pilot…all of them,**" he replies, quickly and loudly. "**Slave circuits.**"
"**I suppose I'm under arrest,**" he adds, cupping his hands together.

"Thats Nice." the Officer replies as he listens to Kalor, motioning for a group of pilots to take control of the ships. Two Stormtroopers affix restraining bolts to both Sparky, and Y7. The older droid making more of a fuss about it then the younger. "It will make it easier to confiscate all three ships."
He then turns to Nadia. "You have been Misinformed. This region is still our center of operations for this system, with the permission of the Manalorian Government."

The condition was swept apart like the sand of Tatooine, when, in protest to the violation of his vessel, Lorcan fires a perfectly aimed sniper stun blast at the Imperial officer from his hidden position. The others watched as the man fell to the ground unconscious. Before the accompanying stormtroopers could even react, the lone gunman has drawn a sidearm, ending the life of a nearby stormtrooper.
As though cued by the fleeing children, a firefight ensued. Faster than the eye could see, the Cathar Jedi had drawn a pistol, firing a barrage of suppression fire at the troopers, while the valiant Kalor Draay drew both his trusty sidearm and his father's lightsaber, taking a step back to safeguard the Mandalorian mother. Nadia drew her own sidearm, taking a quick shot at one of the Imperial pilots, injuring him gravely.
In a courageous attempt to come to the resuce, the young Mandalorian boy, Vau left the safety of his home to join the fight. Carrying a miniature rifle, he aims and fires at the stormtroopers, striking true. His efforts, through appreciated, were proven shortsighted, as the boy receives a deadly barrage of return fire. Hit and injured gravely, he returns to the dwelling, as his mother retreats to tend to him.
Lorcan, a capable warrior, takes down yet another stormtrooper with his rifle, as Sulvar finishes off Nadia's earlier kill. Enraged by the savage attack on the young boy, Kalor's anger gets the better of him, momentarily blinding him in the Force as he charges and successfully decapitates the boy's attacker. Nevertheless, the troopers exploit his weakness, gunning him down to near death with multiple laser barrages.
With cruel skill, Nadia headshots another trooper. The remaining troopers try to gun Kalor down to clear their escape route. His mind quietened by death, the Jedi manages to deflect away many of their attacks, but falls pray to some. Only by miracle of the Force does he still survive.
Lorcan leaves his cover, firing a destructive barrage of fire which guns down two more troopers. The cathar shoots another down. Suffering deadly delirium and fearing his demise, Kalor calls upon the darkness within him, dealing another desperate stab at the final squad member, ending his life.
But no, the ordeal is not yet over. TIE fighters rain fire from the sky, littering the battlefield with a laser barrage. While the lone Jedi deflects away the meager attack as the others suffer minor singes and burns, he crawls away to the cover of a tree. Exhausted, he finally drops still.
Nadia, Sulvar and Daro race to their fighters, but the angels came from above. An assault ship of unknown origin assaults the TIE duo, damaging one fighter and forcing their retreat. The three warriors stand victorious on the field of battle.

Nadia shielded her eyes to get a good look at the ship which had come to their rescue. On the Conqueror-class Assault ship she spotted the familiar markings which denoted the ship to be Ven's and Krad's. Instead of finishing the prep of the fighters she headed over to the officer, tying him up before he could waken and then headed onto the transport to see what she could learn from it. For a starters, when and if they should be expecting more Imperial company.

Nadia tied in her comm to the shuttle's before leaving it. Walking toward Kalor to check on him she waved a greeting to Ven and Krad. With a nod to greeting to the woman helping Kalor she moves back to the officer to see what she can learn from his possessions. Once Kalor is conscious again she heads to where Kalor and Lorcan are and says to them in a low whisper, "**The shuttle came from the *Immobilizer*. I think our friend Moff Cylen, or at least one of his lieutenants survived the attack to his station. They're undergoing repairs at the shipyard.**"

**Heartbeat**...**Heartbeat**
Groggy and seeing nothing but blurry, coloured, moving outlines, Kalor couldn't even lift his lightsaber in defense as the Mandalorian medic dropped to his side, checked his heart rate, and ripped apart his shirt. She pulled something out of her case, and Kalor could feel the cool steel on his chest. The device hummed for a few moments and then fell silent. The woman pushed a button, and Kalor's body immediately arched, painfully, as an electric current revitalized his heart.
**Heartbeat**, **Heartbeat**, **Heartbeat**, **Heartbeat**
Slowly regaining consciousness, vision restored, he watched as the medic pulled out a medpac. Slowly, he reached up to his abdomen, touching the edge of a bleeding wound. "**Yup,**" he moaned groggily. "**That's going to leave a scar.**"
"**Almost lost you there for a minute,**" she replied, tossing his limp hand aside and starting to stitch up the wound edges together. "**You've lost quite a bit of blood.**"
Though delirious, there was still a few clear thoughts in Kalor's mind. "**The others? The boy!**" he groaned. "**Is he alright?**"
"**I'd be more worried about myself right now,**" she replied, focused on her own work. Finishing up the stitches, and after applying a patch, she removes a vial and injection syringe from the medkit. She administers the dose directly into the Kalor's vein and he immediately feels the grogginess disappear. "**Easy,**" she says. "**The drugs will get you back on your feet, but you're going to have to take it easy for a while.**"
"**The house. The boy. Check on the boy,**" insists Kalor, kneeling against as he got back on his feet. Feeling light-headed, he stands there for a few moments, getting his breath back, watching as Nadia, Lorcan and Sulvar gather nearby. He seems to visibly have trouble holding himself up.
"**If the Mandalorians don't like the Empire, then why are they repairing Imperial ships?**" he asks. Coughing, he adds, "**And what makes the Remnant think they can govern the planet by any means?**"

Ka'ra was already attending to Vau's wounds by the time the blasters stopped. It would be awhile before the young warrior would be able to use his arm, but was in no danger.
Krad and Ven walk over and and each embrace Nadia fiercely, Krad even lifting her feet off the ground before setting her back down. "We missed your Nad'ika."
"And its so nice you brought a nice little firefight with you." Ven says, a smile on his face as he took off his helmet, he boasted a new scar on his left cheek and his eye had been replaced with a cybernetic one. "What brings you home, Sister?"
The young woman that had been attending Kalor, stands up and adresses Nadia. Taking off her helmet, she is no more then sixteen, "I'm Lorna, Ven is my *riduur*."

Nadia huffs in embarrassment as her brother in law, Krad, lifts her off her feet in an uncomfortable hug as armor plates shift uncomfortably against each other. "***Lek*, the Imperials are a bunch of party crashers, so we had to teach them a lesson. I was in the area on business. Storn would have been furious with me if I didn't make an appearance.**" Only after saying it did she realize she hadn't said 'father'. Her buir; the only one she had ever known or, unless fate played some terrible trick, she would ever know.
When Lorna stood and addressed herself, Nadia turned to face her. With a large grin on her face she turned her head to look back to tease Ven. "**Ah, so my baby brother finally decided to take a wife, eh.**" Ignoring any sort of rebuttal he may emit she turned her attention back to Lorna casting an appraising eye over her. Nadia knew if this girl was good enough for her brother and Storn had accepted her, she must be something special indeed. Especially since she was almost six years Ven's junior. Stepping forward she made movement to embrace the new found addition to her family. "**Welcome vod'ika. I hope to grow to know you during my short stay here.**"

"**Maybe I should,**" he began as he, still held against the tree, took a step and tried to shift his weight away but was halted by a sudden rush of pain. Backtracking, he finishes with a grin, "**…Stay right here for a little longer.**"
"**What do you intend to to about the Imperials? It won't be long before someone tries to hail back the shuttle. Those TIW fighters that got away are probably reporting in by now.**"

Lorna kneels back down and starts to bandage Kalor's injuries once more. Grabbing Ven's helmet she slaps it on his head backwards. "You just be quiet," She replies in a mildly harsh whisper.
(Kalor regains another 20 hit points)
"We'll contact Eron, I'm sure the *Canderous* will make the *Immobilizer* think twice...." Ven cuts off sharply then, as a Pursuer-class ship comes into view. Its markings make it clear that its a mandalorian ship. As it comes into a landing: Ven, Krad, and Lorna quickly put they're helmets back on, and make it clear Nadia should do the same.

As soon as Nadia saw the symbol she unclipped her helmet form her belt and place it on with the sharp hiss as the seals closed. *Great, that's just what we need… Our great Mandalor Fenn Shysa coming to scold a couple of his people for fighting with customers.* She watched in silence as the ship landing. *Nevermind he was the one to lead the kriffing rebellion* Not for the first time since returning to Mandalore was she filled with a profound sadness.
Standing with her vode she waited to greet their guests. She motioned Kalor to stay put as he was still not in any shape to stand. She jerked her head toward the arriving ship. "***Mand'alor* has come to pay us a visit,**" she said as an explanation to the sudden change in their moods.
As he asked about the bodies she looked around the landing pad. "**Not much we can do about them at the moment, but we will have to get rid of them.**" Unless the ship in orbit made a fuss about retrieving them they would probably be burned or left out somewhere for the few carnivorous animals to have their fill. It all depended on the meeting with Mandalor went she supposed.

With her helmet still on she quietly went to assist Daro in stripping and piling the bodies. Carting them off to be eaten by the scavengers was looking better and better.

As you strip the bodies, you manages to salvage one flight suit, and one suit of stormtrooper armor. As far as weapons go, You locate 4 of the blaster carbines, and two hold out blasters. Any weapons you don't take for your personal use, are immediately seized by Ven and Krad to add to the Armory within the Yaim.
Inside the Shuttle, Kalor starts to listen to the radio transitions. One message gets your interest. "Shuttle Runabout, What is your Return ETA? We have lost contact with both escorts, Give us a SitRep."

He manages to get perhaps half a dozen steps before his stagger turns into a fall, as a particularly large jab of pain hits him, he catches himself with his hands but that jolts his injuries even more so he takes a moment to get his breath back, and pushes himself back up to continue staggering toward the exit.

Seeing Kalor stagger to the exit she cursed and grabbed his arm. "**Are you trying to kill yourself, ner vod?**" Placing his arm over her shoulder she maneavered him back to the cockpit of the shuttle. "**We need to figure out what to tell the *chakaare* up in that star destroyer.**" Setting him back into the chair she listens to the transmissions.
Beneath her helmet she smiles mischievously. "**You know this could be the perfect opportunity to take over a Star Destroyer if we did this right.**" The plan would have to be well thought out and would probably require more personnel than they had at the moment or could gather in a short time frame.

I'd think of something but I'm a little preoccupied at the moment."** as he rests one of his hands over his wound.

Nadia looks at the communication board getting an idea of what the functions were of the various buttons and knobs. "**Well I definitely can't send the message. They'll know something is up the moment they hear my voice.**" An idea springs to mind. "**I wonder if anyone here knows Imperial morse code. Unless you're willing to talk to whoever responds back?**"
They still needed an idea on what they were going to tell them.
"**We could claim the shuttle's engines began to malfunction and had to set down on the surface. One on the ground we lost contact with the fighters as well.**" Nadia shrugged it was an idea. If they claimed the Imperial ships were attacked things might get nasty. "**Or we could just straight out tell them that because of their crews' stupidity their shuttle have been claimed by the Skirata clan.**" Personally she liked the last option, though who knew how the Imperials would react to such news. Not that she really cared. What ever the Imperials decided to do there was only their one ship on orbit and if it was the Moff she believed it was he was unlikely to get support anytime soon. Fierfek, they could call in an opposing Remnant force, let them fight it out and pick up the pieces.

"Shuttle Runabout, If you don't respond we will be forced to consider you compromised." Comes the voice over the comsystem, There was a more worried tone to his voice. "Self Destruct system will be enabled in five minutes."
Time was clearly running out, and should the shuttle self-destruct it was likely to take the Three fighters with it. Needless to say the damage and danger it would cause to Nadia's home and family.

Nadia glanced over at Kalor suddenly alarmed. There went her idea about keeping the shuttle. "**Take care of this, we may need to move the shuttle.**" Moving quickly toward the exit she shouted, hoping that the others hadn't moved to far away to not hear her. "**Vod'ike, we may have a problem! They have a self destruct set on the shuttle!**" Desperately she tried to think of how they might have set up the self destruct.

Kalor looks at Nadia's abrupt exit and then the comm device, and decides to at least try to buy some time for her, adjusting his body to be closer to the comm device, in spite of the bursts of pain through his chest. The he turns the comm on and says into it letting the pain leak into his voice **"This is Shuttle Runabout, sorry for the delay we had a bit of a issue with some pirates. We've beaten them off and should be headed back up shortly, just need to catch our breath first."**

"Who is this? Whats your operating number? Where is Lt Fouts?" Comes the voice of the com operator, and suddenly the control panel of the shuttle is full of angry red lights. The Engines have gone offline, and a timer has started on the forward HUD. (1 minute)
Ka'ra and Krad starts to herd the children aboard the assault ship, while Ven starts the engines once more. Fully intending to preserve the family even if it means abandoning home. They'll be safely away before the count down finishes. "Nad'ika, Come on there's room for you aboard yet."

**"Nad'ika, Come on there's room for you aboard yet."** Ven's words rang in her ears as she thought desperately of all their options. *Room for me? Just me and leave my friends? No, I can't.* Spurred on by a sudden intuition, a nudge granted by the Force she began tearing up the deck plating, ignoring the sharp pain as the metal dug into her hands through her gloves. She had to deactivate the charges. **Kalor! Get out of here! You might be able to make it a fighter.** *But could he get it powered up in time?* Doubtful, it was still covered by the cameo netting. He would have to deal with the canopy above from where it was sitting. The thoughts fueled her on, and she fought to keep control and not let it impede what she had to do.

Daro jumped out of the speeder *Why the frak do these things happen to us?* he asked himself as he ran up to the shuttle. He looked around for a second and spotted the timer **"Sparky get the fighter out of here!** he yelled over his comm and he started looking around for where things could have been hiding. He quickly dropped his tool kit and pulled out a few thing before he started helping Nadia look for the explosives. **"Well if nothing else this will piss Eron off enough that he'll go after the Imps."** he said with a small laugh. He this was no time to joke but he couldn't help it, the comment just seemed to fall out.

Kalor isn't entirely sure that he could make it to his fighter in the condition he is in, not with just a single minute on the countdown timer, and says into the communications device, **"Incapacitated along with most of the rest of the crew, I'm pretty much handling this ship on my own and I'd really rather not be down here should the pirates come back so if you wouldn't mind turning the engines back on?"**

As Kalor once again tries to persuade the Com officer, the link is abruptly severed, preventing any further communications between the shuttle and its mothership. Nadia and Daro start to pull up the deck plating looking for the explosives: Nadia manages to locate a cred chip that someone must have lost at some point, But Daro manages to find several kilo's of demolition charges.

**"I think this is what we're looking for.

He quickly knelt down and pulled out a few more tools to further help Nadia

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-06-23 11:28:35)

Nadia rushed over to where Daro was bent over the ordnance. "**Keep looking. We need to make sure this is all of it.**" Taking a deep breath to calm her nerves she focused on the charges in front of her. All the lessons her mother gave her on such ordnance came flooding back. Marina had always found some perverse pleasure in handling explosives, while the thought of them terrified Nadia. Taking the proffered toolkit and the necessary tools from Daro she got to work.

Kalor looks at the communication gear, not exactly surprised that it didn't work but it was worth a shot, and pulls himself painfully to his feet before pausing for a moment, to regain his breath, and then begins heading toward the exit of the ship and where the others are searching for explosives, supporting a some of his weight by running one of his hands along the wall.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-06-24 15:51:02)

Kalor begins to make his way out of the shuttle, Presumably heading to either the Assault Ship or one of the starfighters for evacuation. Sparky starts up the systems of the Aethersprite, but beeps his annoyance at the lost manuvering thruster is making things difficult. Y7 doesn't complain as he does the same for the X-wing.
Nadia makes her way to the Exposives that Daro had pointed out, and starts to attempt disarming it, But it becomes readily apparent that its its beyond her ability to disable without a proper Security Kit.

### **Alicia** (2009-06-24 22:12:26)

With the revelation Nadia won't be able to get much done with the basic toolkit, she curses. Rather loudly at that. "**Quick. Does anyone of a kriffing security kit?**" She asks the two men in the shuttle with her as she heads for the storage lockers and begins pulling things out looking for one. The racket she was making was, for some reason, comforting to her. And though she was making a mess in the process of locating a kit, she didn't rightly care.

Kalor shakes his head when Nadia asks about the security kit saying, **"Never needed one before."** and then staggers over in spite of his injuries to help her look for one, his search is slower and more meticulous as he doesn't seem to like jolting his body around too much during the search process.

### **Vash** (2009-06-26 19:37:41)

Daro looked around but didn't spot the needed security kit. He walks back up to the cockpit looking down at the timer **"48 seconds…if I could just get the fraking engines to work that might be enough time to get this far enough away that it wouldn't harm anyone….Haar'chak!!!"** As Daro yelled he slammed his fist down on the control panel. There were a few sparks as some of the lights dimmed but the timer remained. Daro continued to swear in Mando'a and kicked the control panel one last time. As he did the red lights went away and suddenly the engines read green. Daro quickly checked everything as he powered them up **"HAHA AND WHO SAID BEATING IT WIT A STICK DIDN'T FIX IT!!"** he yelled in joy **"Nadia get Kalor off the ship I have just enough time to fly this thing up and jump out at the last second. I'm going to need you to catch me with the Nova Sword!!"** he said as he sat down and fully powered up the engines slowly lifting it off the ground **"Move it Nadia I'm not joking around."**

### **Alicia** (2009-06-26 19:51:48)

Nadia stopped in the middle of tossing some ration packs out of the locker she was emptying in her search for a security kit. She let what Daro was saying process for a moment before she scrambled over to Kalor and practically picked him up. Half carrying Kalor out of the shuttle she set him down quickly at the bottom of the ramp. A realization came to her then. "**He doesn't have kriffing seals on his armor.**"

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Darren** (2009-06-26 21:27:40)

Kalor lets Nadia assist him out of the shuttle as they don't really have time for the slow pace his injuries have forced on him and says to Nadia when she mentions the lack of seals, **"Which could be a problem if he makes it into orbit. But he only has maybe thirty seconds left I don't think he'll be able to make it."**
He then pushes his way to his feet looking around for the Nova Sword and starting to stagger toward it his chest still clearly paining him.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-06-26 21:53:11)

Nadia shakes her head as she too heads for the NovaSword. Though she sprints and practically jumps into the cockpit. "**There won't be room for all three of us on the Shereshoy. Head for my vod'ike's ship. They will get you to safety.**" As she speaks she starts warming up the engines. Urging them to cycle faster. She eyes the netting still on the ship and with the Force tries to nudge it off.

### **Darren** (2009-06-26 22:18:38)

Kalor looks around for any other ships still landed trying to determine which one she means and moves slowly toward any of them he finds (if he can't see any he will start heading into the surrounding forest to provide himself with some concealment), careful to not put any unnecessary strain on his wounds now that there is a bit more time although still not a huge amount as the Imperials will no doubt send down additional forces shortly.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-06-26 23:29:02)

The Imperial shuttle slowly raises into the air, Followed by the Mandalorian's in they're assault shuttle. Nadia starts to work on bringing the NovaSwords systems online, but it will take time. The Force guides Kalor to the Aethersprite, which was at one time his Father's ship, and Sparky was his Father's Droid. Not to mention it was already prepared for take-off.
The remaining moments pass by quickly. The Assault ship heads towards the nearest settlement, followed by Kalor in the Aethersprite. The Imperial shuttle heads east, toward the nearest ocean with Nadia following it as soon as the NovaSword was ready.
Unfortunately she's to late. Perhaps the bomb hadn't been set correctly in the first place, perhaps in her attempt to defuse it Nadia had mixed things up. With Daro still aboard, The shuttle exploded.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-06-27 00:00:54)

Nadia shielded her eyes as the explosion from the shuttle blinded her for the moment it took for her helmet to filter out the light. *I was too late.* As the wreckage from the shuttle began to fall into the water she scanned the debris desperately for Daro. The initial scans came in and she slammed her fist on the console. "**Nu kyr'adyc, shi taab'echaaj'la.**"
Sadly she opened a channel to the assault ship, "**The transport has been taken care of. Daro didn't make it off.**" Nadia couldn't help but feel responsible for his death. Maybe if she had been a bit faster he could have been able to eject from the shuttle or if she had been prepared she could have defused the bomb all together. With another fly by she marked the location of the debris before setting a course for Enceri, the nearest settlement, to meet up with the others.
After locating a free landing site close to others' she sets the NovaSword down and slowly gets out.

The Three ships land in Enceri without incident. There wasn't so much a landing field, as simply an expanse of open ground large enough for the ships.
Nadia's family slowly pile out of the Conquer-class Assault Ship, The twins are helping Vau stay on his feet, while Ven and Krad watch over everyone with blasters in hand. Everyone is relieved to see the NovaSword land, but then a quiet falls over them all, as they only see Nadia exiting the starfighter.
"Its alright, Nad'ika." Ka'ra replies, running up and embracing her sister once again.

Nadia jumped down from the cockpit, thankful her helmet hid the tears she was shedding. Ka'ra's embrace did nothing to help the torrent of regret and sadness coursing through her. Her knees started to buckle and it was only Ka'ra's sturdy frame which kept her from collapsing. "**I wasn't fast enough, Jate'kara,**" she whispered to her sister hoarsely. Using the affectionate nickname Storn had given her. *His parents didn't even get their chance to see their grown son. Now they never will.* Her blurred vision caught sight of Kalor and the rest of her family and she forced herself to stand straighter. She was the eldest of her family and with her father apparently away it was she they would look up to. They didn't need her falling apart. Patting Ka'ra's shoulder and returning the embrace she began walking toward the others, using the time to walk over to them to figure out what she was going to say.

Kalor exits the Aethersprite and looks around at the others and noticing Nadia and the missing Daro, and his eyes cloud for a moment with regret wondering if there was anything else he could have tried that would have helped.
He starts to move toward Nadia and Ka'ra, and his eyes clear a little as the pain in his chest reminds him that Daro wasn't the only one to have pain a price for their survival, although Daro's price was by far the higher. He looks around to make sure everyone else seems to have made it alright as he continues to walk forward no doubt making a mess of Lorna's hard work on his bandages.
Once he is certain everyone has made it he looks at Nadia, he hesitates for a moment but decides to speak now anyway, she'll have to take the time for grief later right now there are things that need to be decided, **"So what now? The Imperials are no doubt going to come looking for us, do we wait for them to make the next move? Or do we make one of our own?"**

"**I doubt they will try something again. They weren't supposed to leave their ship to begin with and now Mandalore will probably be more on his guard for anymore intrusions. They would be fool hearty to try anything else.**" *Then again, I would almost like to see them try something else.* The thought came to the forefront. Nadia wanted vengence yes, but she also knew it wouldn't bring Daro back, nor keep her family safe from harm. So, reluctantly, she cast it aside. "**We should be fine here for awhile.**" Looking at her siblings for confirmation, she waited for them to voice their own thoughts on the matter at hand.

"Yes, we're good." Ven replied. Looking over Vau, as Loran double checks his bandages. Krad comes over to put an arm around Ka'ra, pulling off his helmet and kissing her cheek. The children, in they're child sized hand me down *beskar'gam* file out of the ship, and begin running around on the landing field continuing to play as if there hadn't been any interruptions.
"Come along, Nad'ika." Krad says, throwing his other arm over Nadia. "Lets deal with our grief in proper Mandalorian fashion. The closest bar is this way."

Nadia snorts a laugh as Krad puts his arm around her and mentions the bar. "**If we're going get haryc b'aalyc we should go to Keldabe. Get a buy'ce gal fit to wash any sorrow away.**" On some level Nadia was grateful to Krad. At the moment all Nadia wanted to do was go somewhere and destroy something. She feared if she left her family's presence she would just end up getting herself into more trouble than she could handle. Letting him lead her toward Enceri she motioned for Kalor to come along and then put her armored arm around his waist to keep him moving with them. "**You of course will not be excluded.**"

The drinking establishment that Krad lead them too was unimaginatively named "Eats" However it did make it clear what the purpose of the place was. The walls were standard pre-fab construction. However the roof has been done with rough cut native woods, with smoke from a fire coming out a brick chimney. Even outside the doors, you can hear the loud Mandalorians drinking songs.
On the inside, the funisions are more rough cut native woods, Made into long benches and tables, giving the impression its more of a feast hall then just a drinking establishment. There are about ten other warriors in the place at the moment, Most of them are seated together sloshing they're drinks onto the table and doing the singing:
*Naasad'guur mhi,

Kalor looks around the bar and the people sloshing around probably good alcohol which is a bit of a waste but it's not really his problem, and then looks for anything resembling a bar and a bartender so he can get himself a drink. Preferably something strong to take away some of the pain in his chest.
Once he has secured a drink he plans to take a nice long drink of it while waiting for Nadia and Krad to get their own and pick somewhere to sit.

### **Alicia** (2009-06-30 11:28:51)

Nadia looks around the bar a smile forming at the familiarity of the scene. Having come to similar establishments on Mandalore she was glad to see at least some things remained the same. Excusing herself for a moment she makes her way to the privacy of the fresher and only once making sure she was in deed does she remove her helmet. Looking at her pathetic reflection in the mirror she pulls of her gloves to and splashes cool water on her face.
Clipping her helmet to her belt next to her revealed lightsaber she leaves the fresher and heads to the counter ordering a large pint of the local ale as well as a a bowl of the stew. Since Krad had suggested coming here she allowed him to pay for this round of drinks.
Glancing around she sees if she recognizes any of the current patrons.

Krad slaps a few of the drinkers on the shoulder as he passes them, and they respond in kind, as he makes his way to the bar, and flips the bartender a cred chip. Soon the small group, is seated at a table near the fire, and Ka'ra dishes they're share of the stew out of the pot over the fire.
"Come on, Kalor, lets get some meat in you." Ka'ra says, putting the largest bowl infront of him, then sitting beside Krad, leaving Nadia to sit beside Kalor. "So Nad'ika, you never said where you met him."

Taking the bowl she let the heat from it warm her hands before she picked up the spoon. "**No I suppose I didn't. We were working for the same employer.**" She didn't want to have to mention the employer was a pirate for fear they may ruin the cover she had. Though she trusted Kalor now with the secret, but who knew what the drunken Mandos around her would pass on inadvertently. Hiding the hesitation by eating a spoonful of the stew, she savored the taste of it before continuing. "**We were contracted about the same time. I didn't know it was him till just barely a week ago.**"

Kalor doesn't seem to be terribly interested in eating the food, but after finishing of his first drink he gets stuck into the food anyway as his body could use the extra resources. Shortly after he starts eating he pauses for a moment to say to Ka'ra **"You know if you have questions about me you can just ask. I won't guarantee I'll answer but it would probably be a little bit more fruitful then just asking Nadia questions."** after which he goes back to shovelling the food into his mouth.

Cander looked at the finished fighter as he wiped the sweat from his face "**Well it only took me three years"** he said as he smiled **"and tomorrow I'll put it through the tests."** As he looked over the fighter again he let out a small laugh **"You know dual quad cannons may be a bit much but it just means that it can hold its own."** Cander walked up to the ship and wiped a bit of oil off one of the wings and smiled again **"Ok time to go get a drink."**
Cander grabbed his armor and strapped his pistol to his side. As he walked out of the hanger he pulled his hood up and glanced around before locking up **"Have to make sure the Imperial pigs don't see you. I'm sure they would love to mass produce this baby."**  He quickly made his way over to one of the only bars he ever went to **"Ahh Eats, well seeing as how I haven't eaten much in the past week I'm sure this will be a nice meal."** 
Cander walked in and looked around **"Hum kind of busy tonight."** he said quietly to himself as he walked up to the bar **"Give me a StarRise Surprise and a big bowl of stew."** he said not really looking around. As he sat down he heard some say something about a Nadia "There's no way...but she's the only one that I know with that name." he said looking around. As he looked around he almost froze as soon as he saw Nadia's face. His mind filled up with different feelings, but he took a deep breath as he stood up and walked over to her **"Nadia Skirata…what brings you around these parts?"**

Nadia looked up the shock at seeing Cander evident on her face. "**I once called Enceri home**," she said simply. Quickly schooling her expression as she looked on the man she had once called *riduur*, her husband. It was hard looking at him. Korbin had taken on after his father and seeing his face brought back the pain already still so close to the surface.
It seemed like a long moment passes as they started at each other. "**I heard you were looking for me,**" she stuttered. His message was clear in her mind. Eron's voice still ringing in her ears as he said *aay'han*.

The Singing in the bar stops, as everyone turns to watch the heated talk between Cander and Nadia. Many of them are old enough to recognize the pair, and they quickly filled in those that weren't. Soon, Cander's order was brought to the table, and the Bartender, made a few movements to indicate that they should get back to they're drinks.

Cander looked at Kalor, fighting back his first reaction to tell the him to get lost or he may wake up strapped to a missile, and took a deep breath as he narrowed his eyes, hidden by his helmet. He was never one for welcoming outsides, but now with Imps on the planet again he really didn't like them. As looked back at Nadia he pulled his hood back but kept his helmet on. "**You still didn't answer my question."** he said keeping his feelings inside as he mind continued to go through all the memories of their life.
As his order was brought up he removed his helmet and and set it down on the bar. He adjusted his glasses as he white hair fell down between his shoulders and quickly found a seat, taking a swig of his drink. He glanced around the room *Go figure that the night I come out is the night that something like this happens*, He took a few bite of his stew not saying anything before he looked up at Nadia trying to think of what to say

Nadia looked away from Cander and toward Ka'ra and Ven, not wanting to meet Cander's gaze. "**I was in the system and decided to pay my family a visit.**" Taking a long drawl of the ale she hid her increasing anxiety in being Cander's presence. Though their separation had been a mutual decision they had not gone their separate ways on the best of terms.
"**And what are you doing here?**"

Cander looked back down at his stew and took a few bites to keep himself from saying something that he knew would just cause more problems. He finely sat up and looked at her, gathering his thoughts **"Well I was here cause I just finished something that I stared about three years ago."** he said as he muttered something else **"As for the looking for you part, well I was just looking. Never figured I would find you. I thought you would be long gone."** He took another bite of his stew as he looked down back at the bowl.
He knew there was a part of him that wanted to be with her again. How could he not want it, he spent eight years with her, but he knew that it was not going to happen. He couldn't even forgive himself for some of the things he had said, so he knew that Nadia couldn't. He downed his drink as fast as he could and pushed the bowl away **"Sorry I guess my eyes were a bit too big."** he said as he glanced at Nadia "**If you want to talk I'll be in the hanger. You already know which one,"** he said calmly as he stood up

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-07-02 09:03:38)

Nadia watched as Cander walked away and then took a long drawl of the ale, finishing it off. "**Cander Bralor**." Going back to look at the door Cander had left through then added, "**My ex-husband.**" Standing up she went to get a fresh pint of the ale. Not only did she wish to drown her sorrows over the loss of her newly found brother, but now she wanted to forget the memories of those eight years. The pain from both was becoming too overwhelming.
She drank her next round quickly at the bar, before she staggered back to where Kalor and her family were sitting. Looking around she noticed the looks everyone had been giving her and Cander. "**What are you looking at?**" she asked fiercely. Taking her seat, she drank her third pint a bit more slowly than her last.

Kalor waits until Nadia is on her third pint and he has collected his second before he says, **"Clearly you made the right choice dumping him."** and then pauses for a moment, **"But this isn't the time or place to discuss such things, we came here to get drunk, and we seem to have quite a long way to go."** and starts drinking his second pint.

"**He wasn't always like that, and he only acted like that toward you because you are *aruetiise*. Most Mandalorians don't like them. More so because of the Empire**," Nadia shrugged with that thought. Marina having been a Jedi, Nadia had been taught to not be prejudice. Downing her drink and ordering a new one, she decided she didn't want to think about it anymore.
While she waited for her fourth pint to arrive a thought occurred to her. "**Haar'chak! We haven't told Daro's family what happened. Eron probably told them to expect him.**" Her head starting to swim she leaned her arms on the table and buried her head in her arms.

Kalor nods, and says **"They probably would at that, and I'd guess that is best done sooner rather then later, especially if later is intended to be us drunk into a stupor."**, he then looks at Nadia and continues, **"It would probably be best if it came from you, but if you not up to it…"** trailing off to let her fill in the blank.

Krad and Ka'ra joined Kalor and Nadia in drinking. "Yesh, I think it would be best coming from you Nad'ika." Ka'ra replied, her speach already starting to get slurred, as she leaned against her husband. Krad had an arm wrapped around her, and kissed the top of his head. By their fourth drink, everyone is well on they're way to being intoxicated.

### **Alicia** (2009-07-03 12:39:24)

Nadia draws her head up looking over at the brawling men. *I suppose this is our cue to leave.* Slowly standing she determinedly holds herself steady, unsuccessfully at first. "**Come on, Kalor. We should go give the bad news to the Sarkins**." Nadia didn't want to have to do this alone, and seeing as Kalor was the only other one amoung them to have known the adult Daro he seemed the best choice.
Focusing on her siblings she said, "**We'll see you back at the yaim.**"

### **Darren** (2009-07-04 00:41:00)

Kalor stands to follow Nadia out of the bar, having had substantially less to drink, barely enough to even dull the pain in his chest let alone make him tipsy. He pays the brawling men no attention as he walks toward the door of the bar.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-07-04 01:12:40)

Nadia didn't wait for siblings responses as she walked as straight as she could toward the door and out of it. As she left, she put her helmet back on and began cycling through the comm channels she knew the Sarkins once used, hoping one of them was still in use.
"**I never did get Eron's current comm frequency. We may have to get a speeder and drive there…**"

Kalor follows along beside Nadia his strides a lot more even now that the pain in his chest is numbed by the alcohol he drank, and nods once her statement trails off and says, **"It would be better to do this kind of thing in person anyway."** he strides along in silence as she checks her comm frequencies to see if she can locate an appropriate one.

"...take her hand off my.....crfksssss....The treasure is buried... ftzzit.... Listen to that... zizzzit... Daro should be here shortly..." Nadia hears over her com as she just starts to randomly surf though the channels.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-07-06 19:50:01)

Nadia flipped back to the channel where she heard "Daro". Listening she quickly realized it was his sister, Sae, and his mother, Celena, speaking. They were wondering where he was. Eron had apparently told them Daro was on his way to be reunited with them. Taking a deep breath she joined the frequency.
"**Celena? It's Nadia. I'm afraid I have some bad news.**" Pausing Nadia fought to maintain some semblance of calm. She wondered if it would be best to tell her in person that the son she believed was coming home had died just a few kilometers from his home and family.
"Nad'ika?" Comes the Voice of Celena. There was a deep sigh. "Daro isn't with us anymore, is he?"
Nadia lets out an equally deep sigh. "No... No he's not," she says sadly.
Celena is quiet, for some time. "Who's responcible?" There is a quiet cold rage in her voice.
â€¹Nadiaâ€º "An Imperial shuttle came to my family's yaim, picking a fight. After we had dealt with them the ship in orbit activated a self destruct. Daro, was going to pilot it into orbit and evac but it destructed premarturely. He died saving me and mine."
"Then he died well." Celena replied. "Now if you don't mind. I need to ask Eron to turn the Guns of the Canderous against the Immoblizer."
Nadia frowns and looks at Kalor, as she seems to miss a step. "If that is what you want. I'm sorry."
"Its not your fault, Nad'ika." Celena replies, "Now I need to see about Avenging my Son. Your welcome to join us."
â€¹Nadiaâ€º "A tempting offer.. Not sure I could fly my fighter off the ground at the moment."
Even from the Ground you can see the flashes of Turbolasers as the Canderous fires upon the Immoblizer. And Suddenly Nadia's comlink buzzes. "Nadia, its Lana! A spacebattle just errupted up here. Get your peopel back up here ASAP, were running."
â€¹Nadiaâ€º "Is the GOld in any danger?"
"We've already been hit twice."
â€¹Nadiaâ€º "Take the Gold out of range. My people are only after retribution on the Immobolizer. I'll get in touch with Eron."
"Rodger, that." Lana replies, cutting the comlink.
Nadia opens the channel back to Celena. "Could you give me Eron's commlink? The ship I came on is taking damage."
Celena doesn't reply...
Nadiaâ€º "Kriff." What a time to turn off a commlink," she says trying the other frequencies as she heads toward her fighter.

Kalor breaks into a jog toward the vessel he flew in on saying to Nadia, **"I told you it would have been better to do this in person."** he looks up at the space battle going on above them, **"How much of a match is the Canderous for the Immobiliser? I'd hate to see more of your people die."**, it is pretty clear that he is considering doing something once they reach the ships.

### **Vash** (2009-07-07 19:55:48)

Cander flipped his comm on and was about to contact Eron when he noticed the turbo laser fire **"Great, guess I'll have to forgo the tests and it's all trial by fire. I didn't even give it a name yet. Oh well I'll worry about that after I see how it handles."** He adjusted his helmet and took off running toward his hanger **"Eron this is Cander, I finely got that fighter done that I've been working on. I even manged to get a few extra weapons than I had originally planed. Still trying to figure that one out. Anyways I'm on my way up to help out, it's about time we kicked this Imperial scum off our planet."** he says with a bit of an edge as he reached the hanger. He quickly opened the hanger doors and jumped into his fighter. There was still yellow "caution" tape on half the controls and the paint was only half dry.
Cander ripped the tape off and closed the hatch **"Ok time to see what this thing can do."** As soon as the doors open completely Cander opened the throttle, causing his to be pushed back into his seat **"Wow this thing has got some power. More power than any fighter in the fleet right now."** The fighter quickly gained more speed as it started to climb.

Nadia heads for the NovaSword, and wondered in the process if they should take their own fighters and not take just hers. "**I suppose it depends on how bad of shape the Immobilizer was when it first came here. Our main problem is the fact the Gold is getting hit in the crossfire.**" She looks between Daro's Aethersprite and the NovaSword, then up at the sky where the flashes from the turbolasers danced in the sky. "**While I would like a copilot, maybe it would be more effective to have more firepower. Besides, your father would have wanted you to have his old starfighter.**"
Jumping into the cockpit of Shereshoy she prepped it for launced and in the meantime tried to clear her head of the fuzziness she felt. Now that she was possibly about to enter a fight she regretted not having Lee with her.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Darren** (2009-07-08 10:26:41)

Kalor nods at Nadia, **"If the fight depends on how badly damaged the Immobilizer is in I think we could definitely use the extra firepower."** and hops into the Aethersprite to run it through a few quick pre-flight checks skipping as many of the steps as he safely can so that he can get his fighter into the air slightly before Nadia does.
Once he is in the air he runs over a list of his weaponry, trying to determine exactly what his options are once he gets to the battle.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Avarna** (2009-07-08 16:54:27)

The three fighters break though the atmosphere, and its unsure who is fighting who. The *Immobilizer* is an interdictor cruiser, and despite its damage seems to be holding its own against the*Canderous*, an ancient Kyamud Battleship.
Tie fighters clash with the random collection of starfighters used by the Mandalorians. Its almost impossible to see the *Frylla's Gold* on the scanners with the mass of the ship yard between it and Nadia, Cander, and Kalor. It has yet to free itself from the yard, desperately firing its one working laser cannon at the docking clamps.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Darren** (2009-07-11 06:35:02)

Kalor steers his fighter toward the *Frylla's Gold* locking the least likely to shred the hull of his weaponry on the docking clamp in an attempt to help it get free, firing as soon as his weapons lock on.

Cander double checked all his settings "Ok let do this." He pulled the last bit of tape the was on the top of the throttle and pushed it to the edge. As he did the last of his HUD popped up and his weapons came online. Cander quickly looked around finding his first enemy fighter and letting lose what looked like support fire from a blaster cannon battery off a small corvette

### **Alicia** (2009-07-12 17:55:04)

Nadia takes one look at the situation before maneuvering the NovaSword toward the trapped *Frylla's Gold*. Using ever once of speed it can manage she tries to get there to fire on the pylons keeping it attached to the space dock.
(( Swift increase speed Pilot +14, Move get in position (double if necessary). and if in range Laser Cannons Attack +13; Damage 6d10+3 x2 ))

Cander blasts a Tie Fighter into dust, But this only serves to draw the attention of a handful of Tie Interceptors. One of the interceptors misses entirely, while quick evasive action causes the second to miss, but the final attack rocks the Prototype fighter. (Doing 41 points of damage, Reducing your SR, and moving you down the condition track.)
******************************
Between the efforts of Nadia and Kalor, They manage to damage the docking Pylon enough for the struggling engines of the *Frylla's Gold* to rip it away. The bigger ship is freed from its dock, and begins making its best time to the edge of the system.
One of the Stations automated defense turrets take aim at the NovaSword, Forcing Nadia to take evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit. But it continues to track the fighter preparing to take another shot at it.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Darren** (2009-07-15 05:04:47)

Kalor turns the *Aethersprite* now that the *Fyrlla's Gold* is free of the station and flys in an escort position to keep the ship safe, intending on engaging any fighters that intend to interfere with it leaving the battle zone.

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-07-19 14:49:28)

Nadia curses as the automated turret targets her ship. Opening a channel to the ship yard she tries to get a hold of someone. "**This is Nadia Skirata, an automated turret is targeting my fighter. Please readjust the targeting sensors before I'm forced to take measures.**" She waited for a response in one form or another, but in the meantime prepares to go off to assist the *Canderous* in taking out the Imperial presence. Checking the sensors she makes sure the *Fyrlla's Gold* will make it safely away from the confrontation.
It's then she smells something rather rank coming from somewhere in the cockpit. Her helmet filter had till then prevented the worst of the smell from reaching her. Sparing a quick glance around she finds the source. Wedged between the floor and the copilot's seat was a Strill. "**You've got to be kidding me.**"

Cander growled as the Ties shot at his new ship **"You…I'll kill you for that!!"** he yelled as he checked his systems **"Note to self, get a astromech."** he said turning the controls hard, adjusting the throttle, and taking aim on the Tes **"Lets haa'taylir how ori gar rugams are"** he said as he opened fire

"Unable to comply, Skirata." Comes the short curt reply from Control. The frustrated controller is clearly more preoccupied trying organize transports and work crews and getting them clear of the fighting. Meanwhile the Strill lets out a belch, and starts to chew on a bone it had apparently dragged into the fighter with it.
Meanwhile, the automated turent takes another shot at the NovaSword.
(Misses)
Kalor, In the Aethersprite starts escorting the *Frylla's Gold*, The transport ship seems to be unimportant to either the *Canderous* Or *Immoblizer* and none of the Mandalorian or Imperial Fighters move to engage it.
Cander's lasers connect with one of the Tie Intercepters, causing heavy damage. Its not destroyed, but the Pilot isn't stupid and immediately disengages from combat against the prototype fighter. The Mando pilot lucks out, as one of the Intercepters blindsides him, However a weapons malfunction prevents it from dusting him. ((I'm assuming you'd like to use a destiny point to negate what would otherwise be a critical hit, and thus certain death.))

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Darren** (2009-07-29 07:12:29)

Kalor continues to escort the Frylla's Gold for another second or so until it is clear that it is perfectly safe and effectively in the clear. Then he will bring the Aethersprite back around toward the Novasword to make sure Nadia is safe and intending on neutralising the automated turret with some fire from his lasers.
As he flies toward the station he radios the Station Control, **"Please cease firing on the nearby friendly fighter."** to give them a bit of warning as to what he is planning. Should they cease fire he won't open fire on the station merely fly by it then proceed into the main thrust of the battle.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Alicia** (2009-07-29 10:20:34)

Nadia lets out a growl as the automated defenses take another shot at her. For the moment she ignores the stowaway Strill.
"Kalor, I don't think they can fix it right now. I'm going to get out of range." With that said she increased her speed as she piloted the NovaSword at top speed away from the station, heading toward the fray between the Mandalorians and the Imperial ships.
(Increase speed: Pilot +14, Vehicular Combat if needed. I want to place as much distance as possible and if not distance than an enemy fighter.)

Cander closed his eyes waiting for the explosion, but was pleases when the weapons didn't fire **"Hey Eron how about sending a fighter or two my way. This ship is good but they're getting some lucky shots every now and then."** he s said as he turned his fighter so that his cross-hairs lined up over the the fighter. **"Time to die scumball.**" he said in a low calm voice as he pulled the trigger

"Cander, I suggest you withdraw. This fight is personal." Eron replies to Cander's request for assistance. as the *Canderous* continues to pour fire into the *Immobilizer*. Already damaged, the interdictor cruiser is no match for the Keldabe.
The Tie intercepters fire once more at Cander in his protoype, but they're lasers fail to connect. and he fails to damage either of them. Nadia has no problem outdistancing the automatic defense turret, while Kalor continues to escort the ignored *Frylla's Gold*

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 1: Mandalore

### **Darren** (2009-08-07 20:16:01)

Kalor turns the *Aethersprite* away from escorting the *Frylla's Gold* now that it should be at a safe enough distance from the fighting and flys back toward the battlezone to join up with Nadia, readying himself and his ship for combat.
