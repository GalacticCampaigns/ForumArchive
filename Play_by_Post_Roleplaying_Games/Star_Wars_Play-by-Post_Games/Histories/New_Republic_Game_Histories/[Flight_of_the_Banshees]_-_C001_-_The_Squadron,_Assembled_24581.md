# [Flight of the Banshees] - C001 - The Squadron, Assembled

### **simplyscribed** (2010-02-07 15:01:27)

*The cold empty black of space. Empty that is aside from the lifeless hull of a Nebulon-B Frigate, blackened and broken; around it the scattered debris of what had once been an Interdictor mingled with the corpses of numerous escort ships and fighters.
In the middle of it all, only four functioning starfighters remain: four x-wings belonging to new members of Banshee Squadron. It is only a matter of time before reinforcements arrive, but for which side? The odds are on the Imperials, for it was their ambush that led to this situation. Which means it is up to the four Banshee recruits to prevent the capture of the Nebulon-B's valuable cargo at all costs, or at least make the enemy pay so dearly their victory will be hollow.
The survivors: of Second Flight, Lieutenants Xin'dan and Var; and of Third Flight, Chiisuk and Paige-Tarkin.*
Or so says the scenario of the final simulation in a set designed to test the recruits in situations without their normal chain of command and working with pilots from other flights.
*It is with a dreadful inevitability that a Victory II-class Star Destroyer winks into existence beyond the fields of debris and a TIE squadron deploys, scrambling to attack.*

Romana's gaze follows the broken remains of an X-wing s-foil as it passes her cockpit. Though she is aware that this being a simulation, she cannot fight the memories of the battle she had fought in the space above Agamar.
*Nek squadron had been sortied out against a vastly larger force and early into the blattle a few of them had fled, fearful for their lives. Romana had seen her commanding officer's fighter spiraling from an engine hit. The attack had knocked the wing off entirely, and had almost hit Romana's ship in the process. Even though he was sure to die he still barked out orders, to the squadron, to her. The orders were simple, 'keep the invasion force busy, buy time for the evacuation below.'*
The console in front of her brings her back to focus. Reinforcements had arrived, however, for the other side. A star destroyer now sits in view, smaller ships pouring out from its underbelly. *TIEs no doubt, a squadron by the looks. Probably another left in reserve, if not more.* **"Kobayashi maru,"** a soft-spoken ryl curse signifying her displeasure with the scenario. Switching over to the squadron's channel, she brings the remaining fighters into contact. **"Any of you been in a scenario like this before? I doubt it."** She says frankly. **"This doesn't look like something anyone walks away from. Still, the Major said that we need to keep our charge safe, and so safe it will be kept. Safe from these buggers, and whoever else may appear."** Though her words were meant to inspire, with this group it was hard to gauge what the actual effect would be. With a desire to split the enemy forces, Romana banks her ship to the right.

Chiisuk takes in the situation before the fight begins, while he can still think. He reaches over and flips the switch on the blinking comm board--
"(snap)---thing anyone walks away from. Still, the Major said that we need to keep our charge safe, and so safe it will be kept. Safe from these buggers, and whoever else may appear." Came over the the comm, 2nd Lt Tarkin's voice laced with static and white noise.
"Majorsss sssaid prevent capturess at all cossst." His Basic comes out mangled by his strong accent, "but Chiissssuuk agreesss. Chissssuuk rather dessstroy Imp *Hak* than B-frigatess. Ssssave protonsss for big *Hak*, lazersss for little *Hak*, yessss?"
Chiisuk falls back into Dosh, which he can speak in much faster, "Jahumba, prep to reroute power, and hold on, the fun begins shortly."
He rolls the engine power levers between his claws before coaxing them forward, feeling the *davjäan inyameet* beginning to kick in- the bloodlust. He moves the control yoke forward and rolls slightly to the left, enjoying the thrill of screaming engines and imagining the kills to come.

Outnumbered four to one, and with enemy reinforcements on the way. Only a few inches of metal and a big piece of the void stood between him and a fiery defeat. Set opened his eyes and surveyed the scene through the onboard computers, it was times like this he wished they'd given him an A-wing instead. Then he could rely on his own skill to avoid damage rather than the strength of the X-wing's shields. His fingers played across the controls as he prepared for the confrontation, the Astro droid had been ordered to keep everything level, and focus on keeping the shields up.
"Nobody try to be a hero," His voice rasped over the intercom as he began to hurtle forwards, "We should split up into pairs and draw them away from the Destroyer. That way we can finish this before the rest of the bloody imperials show up." The engines lit up as he moved forwards and the ship hummed to him.

### **Anazider** (2010-02-13 12:30:42)

**"Do try to keep up, all of you. And lets hope you lot don't get in my way like last time."**
The X-wing's engines blaze from idle to full burn as Anazider lets the throttle all the way out, his attack vector taking him directly at the focal point of the wedge. A string of blips, bleeps, and blurts can be heard over the intercom, Rosey voicing its opinion, and the little droid doesn't sound very enthused about the Prince's choice of strategy.
**"We most certainly will *not* be vaporized, thank you very much! How is that you've become so sour when your master is such a delightful fellow? Bad lube job this morning?"
"Bleepblurtblurt-bzzzaap!"
"Come now, you'll melt your finish with such language! And who's going to pay for it, hmm? Certainly not I. Now cease your nagging and focus the sensors forward on the lead Eyeball. They shall be the first this day."**
Anazider sends the snubfighter into a series of tight spirals, as much flourish as they are effective in preventing targets locks. Expertly manipulating the controls, he coaxes as much thrust out of the quad-engine core as he can muster, his charge ending with the screaming report of a proton torpedo, despite the Nautolan's advice.

Even as the others open up a dialogue across the comms, Banshee 6 is already gunning the throttle toward the enemy despite the vocal protests of the pilot's unfortunate astromech droid. The others scatter in different directions, breaking formation in the hope of separating the enemy.
As instructed, Rosey provides a targeting lock on the lead TIE. Opening the combat with a literal bang, Anazider doesn't hesitate in expending a proton torpedo.
The eyeball's pilot takes evasive action when he realises a missile is incoming, and avoids it for several seconds by means of a succession of tight turns and rolls that even Anazider has to admire. But in the end he cannot match the torpedo's speed, and becomes the battle's first casualty as the ordnance impacts on one of the TIE's solar panel struts and the vehicle explodes into so much scrap metal.
Breaking into Flights, the remaining 11 TIEs go on the offensive. Three eyeballs gun straight for Anazider, their pilots obviously intent on revenge. A second Flight also approaches him, and the Prince of house Xin'dan finds himself amidst a maelstrom of acid green lasers. He deftly avoids most with a series of elegant rolls, but one skilful shot impacts against his x-wing's shielding.
Meanwhile, the remaining group of eyeballs screams up along the Banshees' other flank, splitting into pairs and attacking Chiisuk and Set Var. Against all the odds, despite the range and Set's excellent defensive flying, one of his aggressor's shots punches straight through his shielding and glances the rear of the ship, by the engines. Warning lights flash on immediately and his R3 unit wails. As he banks away from the TIEs to avoid further shots, the Nautolan feels that his x-wing isn't responding as smoothly as could be expected. Clearly its systems took significant damage from the hit.
Behind the screen provided by its starfighters, the enemy star destroyer slowly advances in the direction of the lifeless Nebulon-B.
((OOC: Anazider's x-wing takes 49 damage and goes down -1 on the condition track, and its SR is reduced to 10.

'Is it my imagination,' asks Captain Kassadi as she watches the battle unfold on the screens in front of her, 'or are the TIE pilots rather better than average?'
Major Strythe smiles and nods her head in acknowledgement.
'Of course. They're all at different levels, actually, but some of them are programmed to be downright deadly. We already know the Banshees are better than average, so running them through sims based on statistically average opponents wouldn't really benefit us. It certainly wouldn't benefit them. This will help them grow, and hone their edge.'
'It may even teach some humility,' comments Commander Nahl after suppressing a chuckle.
'That would definitely be a plus, wouldn't it?' Strythe replies, focusing momentarily on the screen showing Anazider's situation.
'What do you make of that, Eric?'
The Jedi ponders the question then answers with explicit honesty:
'He's got guts and he's got ability, but he's damned impulsive. Not a good candidate for anything involving responsibility, or there'll be no checks in place to prevent him drawing the others into his pace. Overall, unless he can fix his attitude he's going to be a problem case.'
'I agree, and I'm not sure why he was recruited specifically for this when we could have pulled another pilot from New Republic ranks. Didn't Hand explain why he wanted him to you, Captain?'
'No,' Kassadi replies with a sour expression, 'you know Hand about as well as I do by now, Major. He's a very private man when it comes to his thoughts. When I asked he was typically enigmatic and evasive, then he waved his hand and said "It'll all work out and you'll see I was right all along. Probably". After that he blew a smoke ring in my face which is his usual way of telling me to get out of his office.'
'Hmmm. Well as long as it will probably all work out,' Strythe says, grinning.

### **Anazider** (2010-02-13 18:04:45)

Anazider smirks as the lead TIE Fighter bursts into a small thermonuclear explosion, not being quite quick enough to evade the torpedo. But the smirk soon turns into a frown, and then a sneer as the Falleen begins a series of evasive maneuvers.
**"How dare they?! Rosey recalibrate the shields, I want us back up to max, and see if you can lock down that backup power conduit, its bleeding over into the primary line. Lets have a little fun here!"**
The X-wing whips into a spiraling dive that would send a lesser pilot for his lunch bag, but elicits nothing more but a bout of furious laughter from the Prince. When the TIEs are trailing he cuts his forward thrust and spins about-face, opening up with a salvo of laser fire on the first eyeball to follow after him, all the while going through series after series of erratic, and seemingly disjointed, defensive patterns.

Romana sat in her cockpit stupefied, as she watched the others fly vigorously into the fray. Two, ended up being shot. Even more to her amazement, his Highness thought to waste a perfectly good torpedo on a TIE of all things. Not one to enjoy losing, Romana spends the better part of a second cursing his lack of foresight. Her heart beat races in anger, only to turn into concern as she sees squad mate being pursued by over half the opposing squadron. *He's lucky he's worth more to me alive.* She thought as she veered at the swarm of TIEs. **"K9, adjust the frame-rate on the targeting computer, we're going in fast and hot. And be mindful of the shields, they aren't going to ignore us forever."** As the refresh on the targeting system starts to quicken, she starts pushing her throttle forward to coax a bit more speed from her engines. As the engines of the Prince's X-wing start to grow in her vision, she reassures him of the obvious. **"You're not alone, Six."**
With only subtle course adjustments, Romana lets loose a volley of laser fire, careful not to hit the Prince or more specifically his cargo.

Chiisuk's cockpit rings with the snarling, guttural sounds of vehement Dosh cursing. ***"Wasteful. TIE not threats, mission calls for SD to be stopped,"*** he continues in Dosh, knowing that the lack of a clear chain of command made anything said an opinion, and thus all the more likely for overly cocky fighter pilots like the new Banshee recruits to ignore.
He watches the scene unfold while dodging TIE fire and feels his ire die, ***"Jahumba, we have lost. We cannot win, even if we stop the Star Destroyer, even if most of us live. We have failed,"*** the disappointment is clear in his voice, along with frustrated resignation. Jahumba lets fly a low mournful whistle in response. ***"Lacumba, Jahumba!!! Sham ba Lu mi lowe!!!"*** Chiisuk says with a quite but harsh voice, ***"Just because we have lost doesn't mean we can't at least show up that arrogant fool. Give me a tonal lock on the SD's shield generator tower, and continue prepping for damage control."*** Jahumba gives a joyful high-pitched droid trill and begins carrying out his orders.
Chiisuk focuses, intent on closing the distance to his objective. He coaxes even more power out of the engines and keeps one hand on the yoke and another on the pitch and roll controls, with both eyes on his sensor read out watching for incoming volleys of green death and doing all he can to avoid their touch. Jahumba begins to beep in an increasingly higher pitch and with increasing frequency the closer to the target they come.

Set cursed as his fighter began to spin out of control. Mechanical fluid leaked from the damaged wing, freezing into crystals as it met the cold void, leaving a creamy coloured vapour trail behind the careening craft. "Lock that bloody stabilizer down Cutey!" Shouted Set as he struggled to regain control of the fighter.
The droid quickly got to work, using it's welder and probe to isolate the damage stabiliser before rerouting power through to it's working twin. A few moments later and the fluid leak had been closed too, the craft became Set's again and he set upon silencing the enemy Tie fighters.
"Keep us together QT and get working on the shileds," He ordered whilst lining up a shot on a nearby Tie Fighter. He keyed the controls and let the ships laser cannons blast into life, they ripped through the darkness towards the Tie.

Prince Anazider turns his x-wing in a rapid retreat from the mess of foes around him, passing by Romana's fighter on his way. Putting some distance between himself and the enemy he turns his fighter around. Still flying with an eye to evasion, he snaps off a quick attack at one of the nearby TIEs, but the pilot of that vessel proves fairly adept, jinking out of the way with some finesse.
Blessedly unaffected by the opening volleys, Chiisuk sticks to his initial course, the Trandoshan coaxing his craft and persuading it to go much faster than it was designed to handle. The engineers might have something to say to him after the mission but the engines take the strain.
Determined to at least save her foolhardy comrade, Romana throttles her controls and screams in toward the cluster of enemy fighters. She doesn't seem to be able to coax the power from her engines that she really wants, but it is enough. Her x-wing shrieks in and strafes through the space where her target had been, but the eyeball is already gone - and hot on her tail! Her foe attempts to drap her into a dogfight but she adeptly bring her own fighter out of his threat range, instead bringing herself within attack run distance of an entire flight.
Meanwhile, her target's companions chase Anazider. Neither of them manage to score a hit on the Prince, who adroitly avoids every attempt. However, his evasive maneuvers preevent him from avoiding being locked down, and the same TIE he himself so recently attacked manages to drap him in a dogfight, the two fighters spiralling around eachother at dizzying speed.
Set recovers from the disastrous opening seconds of the combat as best he can. His droid "Cutey" successfully reroutes the power of his x-wing, channeling it to where it is needed despite the structural damage impeding its progress. Immediately the controls seem to become more responsive. Despite this, his attack attempt is unsuccessful, the eyeball nimbly evading the burning bolts sent its way.
The second enemy flight ((TIEs 6-8)) breaks itself into pairs, the TIEs using their superior speed to close in around both Romana and Set from either side.
Both of the Nautolan's foes shoot with considerable accuracy. Despite his x-wing's condition he manages a very neat spin to avoid one incoming laser, but fails to so neatly avoid a second. It is not an incredible shot, but with the current state of his fighter its enough: something important has shorted and his power dies completely, leaving him dead in space.
Romana finds herself the victim of an incredibly precise shot. Her x-wing shakes as the bolt punches through her shielding and strikes the underside of the craft. K9 whistles a rapid warning: the bolt hit nothing immediately crippling, but she is now leaking alarming amounts of engine coolant.
The final flight all target Chiisuk, buzzing around him like hornets. Despite his best attempts to keep them off him, but a pair of them lock him into a constant flow of evasive maneuvers, allowing no respite as they continually thwart his attempts to make a clean break from their midst.
The enemy's star destroyer veers away from the Banshees, turning its arrowhead and moving ponderously along the battlefield's right flank.
((Anazider is successfully drawn into a dogfight with TIE 2. His SR is back up to 15.
Believe it or not, Set's x-wing was hit for exactly 27 hit points.
Romana's x-wing is hit for 91 hp (crit!) and goes down -1 on the condition track, and its SR is reduced to 10.
Chiisuk is successfully drawn into a dogfight with both TIE 11 and TIE 12.))

'Its a pity he was taken out of action so quickly,' Nahl comments as he watches the debacle occurring on the screen dedicated to Set's x-wing, 'he's performed much better in previous exercises. They all have. You'll need to watch the footage, Captain.'
'I have,' replies the NRI officer with a smile, 'and I have no doubt they have the skills for the job. I don't envy you two the task of making them work as a unit though.'
'The scenario may be a bust,' Strythe comments, 'but there's some spectacular flying going on. Those TIEs are being made to really work to get their hits in.'
'Its only a matter of time though?'
'Oh yeah, this is a decisive loss. Unless they pull off something damn-near miraculous.'
~~~~~
Set's view goes black as his contribution to the simulated scenario ends. The "cockpit" opens to allow him access to the hangar-like room wherein rows of simulators are kept for NRI use. The three nearest to him are still in use.
The squadron's supply officer, the four-armed droid Rook, waits nearby.

As Chiisuk screams towards the Star Destroyer two of the TIEs settle in on his 6. **"Chiissssuk hassss no patiensssse for thissss!!!** His claws fly across the controls and he kills all forward thrust, rolls sharply to one side, dumps all power to his starboard engines and attempts to turn the tables on the *hak*. ***"Jahumba, tonal lock on this fool and finish your preparations."*** Chiisuk continues his maneuver, and as the beeping from R3 reaches the proper tone and becomes solid he unleashes a wave of coherent light and concentrated death on the TIE fighter.
Not paying much attention to the outcome of his attack he immediately throws all power to his portside engines and fires his breaking thrusters, which serves to launch his fighter out of the area. He hopes the TIE pilots aren't adept enough to match his flying and tries to continue on towards the Star Destroyer.

**"Stang!"** Romana curses, as her target is nowhere to be found. That is until he appears behind her, showering her in the green fire of his TIE. Through a few weaves of the yoke, she manages to elude his shots. As she fights for her life, she sees her Nautolan compatriot take a hit. The lights fade from his engines, and the craft begins to spin out of control. She feels little remorse for him, as the two had yet to see eye-to-eye since their first meeting. Still, he was in her squadron. They had the same objective, even though they felt different courses of action were needed. If she survived this, she would have to remember to check his fighter.
As she stares off at his disabled craft, her own takes a powerful hit to the hull. One of the TIEs had scored a hit on her, sending K9 and herself into a world of panic. The system board was indicating a rupture coolant line to the lower port engine. With one hand controlling the fighter, her other begins a system shutdown to the affected engine. With her attention split between flight control and damage control she has little time to aim at anything, but does manage to squeeze off a few shots to clear a path.
**"To the Hells with this."**
Pulling a long 180, Romana began a trip back to the frigate. As someone who always has a plan, she finds herself in uncharted space. The group is vastly outnumbered, and the Star Destroyer is now moving into a firing position. *There is no hope, only inevitability.*

Just as Anazider's fingers grasp the firing trigger, he catches sight of the cascade of blue sparks that washes over Set's fighter as it drifts lifelessly off into the depths of space. This distraction is just enough to cause his torrent of blaster fire to stray wide of his intended target, which then sends the Falleen into whirlwind of.
**"Bleetlreblrpblazzzp wooo!"
"I'm not blind Rosey, I saw what happened! Fine, fine, I thought I might receive some help this session, but I suppose there's no rest for the wicked! Time to win this thing…"**
The X-wing dives, spins, and then cuts at incredible angles as the Prince begins to show his true talent, each maneuver as frenetic yet controlled as a passionate dance. When the TIE fighter on his aft draws close enough to gain a target lock, Anazider reverses thrust in a flash giving himself a perfect shot at the TIE's exposed underbelly.
Once the TIE fighter is disposed off, Anazider guns the snubfighter due south, his sights set on the Star Destroyer.

Both Chiisuk and Anazider are successful in their attempts to outwit their enemies. Within mere split seconds of each other, the two pilots score excellent hits on an eyebal apiece; the Trandoshan's tears apart the engines of his target while the Falleen's strikes with near surgical accuracy through the TIE's cockpit, exploding the glass outward into open space and vaporising the innards including its pilot.
Both Banshees also manage to escape their current dogfights and avoid being locked down by more as they pass enemy fighters, though both remain plagued by TIEs. Chiisuk in particular finds himself on the run with three of the enemy squadron right on his tail, each laser bolt seeming to be fractionally closer to his craft than the last. For his part, the Prince of House Xin'dan finds that his beautiful flying fails him for a second time as a green laser washes across his shields and causes them to ripple and his vessel to shake violently. R0-Se wines over their private comm channel, complaining of severe scorching.
Romana turns her own x-wing around, intending to double back to the Nebulon-B Frigate they are so desperately attempting to defend. During the turn she flies with an eye to defense, and the pot shot she makes as she passes a TIE is easily evaded by its pilot. She soon finds herself being chased through space not only by her own opponents, but also by the eyeballs that so recently had been engaged with her comrade Set Var. It seems like she is walled in by the sheer volume of lasers being sent at her fighter, yet she finds openings to slip through and keeps the x-wing intact against all odds.

'They did well to escape those dogfights,' comments Major Strythe, 'especially Chiisuk. These guys really fly well under pressure.'
Captain Kassadi frowns as she responds: 'let's hope they still fly well without needing such a dangerous trigger.'
'Look at this now,' interrupts Commander Nahl, pointing at Romana's screen where her x-wing can be seen jinking and juking and tightly rolling to avoid the laser fire of her four pursuers.
'Is she planning what I think she's planning?' Strythe asks, leaning in toward the screen with rapt attention.
Nahl nods as he answers:
'Yes,' he says with conviction, 'I believe she is.'
'Paige-Tarkin, is it?' Kassadi asks coldly, 'let's hope for the sake of her mission she shares the family affinity for obliterating defenceless targets.'
'Captain Kassadi,' Nahl says gently but reproachfully in his deep, soothing tones, 'that was unbecoming of you. That sort of pre-judgement based only on her name must be a terrible burden to bear. It could destroy a person.'
'I for one don't trust her any more or less than the other recruits,' Strythe states.
'Let's not judge them based on their past, their family, or even their previous service record. Let's judge them on their actions as Banshees.'
Kassadi's face colours slightly and she turns away to watch the other screens.

Romana's breathing was becoming erratic as the barrage of green lasers kept missing her. Had it not been for the inertial dampeners her body would not have been able withstand some of the maneuvers she did to avoid being targeted. K9 let out a whistle as a bolt whizzed by his port, Romana was too preoccupied to correctly interpret it, but it had a ring of admiration or amazement. **"K9, I need you to trigger the emergency shut off valve for the lower port engine coolant line. The engine shut off didn't stop the leak, and it'll empty the reservoir quickly if we don't stop it. Hold on too, I don't need you falling out during this."** Her warning comes with an overly animated and loose barrel roll, it's purpose is to keep going in the same direction, but keep the ship moving around an enemies targeting brackets.
During the accentuated maneuver Romana punched in some commands to boost the power to the remaining engines. The TIEs were fast, and she needed to at least match their speed if she was to have a chance at finishing this simulation alive. There was an enemy fighter in her path to the frigate, Romana squeezes the trigger and lets loose another burst of red laser to dissuade from his position and allow her free access to her *target.*

Anazider ignores Rosey's frantic peals, and the furious shaking of his starfighter as it threatens to rattle apart at the seams. He ignores the barrage of laser bolts shrieking past his canopy and even the dire situations of his comrades, and instead does as he has always done when it is time for him to achieve an objective:
He focuses.
The entire vastness of space melts away to a single point off in the horizon, leaving only the Victory-class Star Destroyer in the Prince's field of view. His mind rapidly progresses through a multitude of possible approaches and attack vectors, discarding and evaluating in seconds before he settles upon a singular approach and the battered snubfighter moves as if an extension of his will.
Spiralling, dipping, and diving, the X-wing goes through incredible maneuver after maneuver until the targeting reticule lines up for that one brief, perfect moment and Anazider brushes the trigger, sending a proton torpedo toward the Star Destroyer's bridge like a vengeful comet.

Chiisuk wonders vaguely as to whether or not Victory II Star Destroyers have convenient exhaust ports near their engines, two meters wide or otherwise. The blazing curtain of green laser fire around his canopy brings him back from his pointless ponderisms and back to the impossible task ahead.
***"Jahumba, shields or engines?"*** he asks his droid as he tweaks and manipulates the power relays of his engines, hoping to coax them into over-performing one more time. Jahumba responds with a high pitched squeal of fright and digital curses at the onslaught of close calls from the TIEs in hot pursuit, more concerned with his own survival than his master's redundant questions. Thankfully, though terrified, the little droid is dutiful, maintaining the tonal lock on the VSD. ***"Engines it is."*** Chiisuk whispers, the davjäan inyameet - the "burning in the blood" - reaches its peak, and his claws tighten on the control yoke's firing stud. The proton torpedo bursts from his fighter, carrying his rage to his enemies.

Anazider coaxes every last bit of power he can from his bird, Rosey doing her bit by miraculously keeping the systems functioning at spec. His x-wing flashes across the inky blackness, closing dangerously close to the Imperial Star Destroyer.
He launches a proton, the missile spiralling out of the tube and then pursuing its lock. The missile punches part-way through the capital ship's shielding before exploding, causing some ultimately insignificant damage to the outer hull near the bridge.
Chiisuk orchestrates a similar offensive, his own missile targeting the engines of the *Victory II*-class. His proton glances harmlessly off the shields and explodes without impact.
The remainder of the first TIE wing ((3 & 4)) close in on Romana, and for a short but perilous time she is completely surrounded by the speedy if fragile Sienar craft. Somehow she slips through the closing net, going as fast as she can make her fighter travel toward the Nebulon-B. The complete wing that she had previously been engaged with follow her, though they begin to drop behind in the face of her superior control. However, she is less able to avoid their attacks, another green laser splashing through a weak point in her shields to scorch the x-wing's paintwork.
Somehow she survives, but even as he does his best to keep the x-wing function at optimal levels, K9 informs her that a single hit more, however weak, will almost certainly destroy them.
The three eyeballs from the final TIE flight chase after Anazider and Chiisuk, determined to prevent them from doing further damage to the capital ship under their protection. Perhaps spurred on by the sudden urgency of the scenario their fire seems to increase in accuracy and it is all the New Rupblic pilots can do to avoid being struck.
Their fortune is finite, however. The Star Destroyer opens fire with all its batteries at the tiny pests plaguing it. There are obviously great minds operating the targeting systems, for some of those batteries fire with deadly accuracy despite the vessel's lack of point-defence capability. Enough, in fact, to put paid to Banshee Six and Banshee Twelve.
Framed by TIE laser fire and turbolasers, Anazider finds even his maneuvers exhausted and his craft is diminished to nothingness in a great explosion when a turbolaser rips through his shields and pierces the x-wing from end to end.
Chiisuk, meanwhile, finds himself caught firmly in the grip of a tractor beam. Before he can even think of fighting against it, several additional beams add their strength to the first and he is drawn aboard the enemy ship.
((Anazider -1 Force Point.
Anazider's proton hits ISD. It takes 2 damage, and its SR is reduced by 5. Chiisuk's proton is soaked entirely.
Romana's x-wing takes a further 17 damage (12 left) and has its SR reduced by 5.
Romana's x-wings is +1 on the condition track.
Anazider and Chiisuk are both the victim of crits by the ISD.))

'Well then, its all but over,' Commander Nahl says as all the screens but those displaying Romana go blank.
'It is over,' Strythe corrects him, 'on her own she has only the slimmest chance of destroying the Nebulon-B. No, its time to end this.'
Nodding in acknowledgement, her fellow officer keys in the mission override on a nearby console.
~~~~~
The screens in Chiisuk and Anazider's simulators go dark. Then, abruptly, so does Romana's. Briefly, she sees the message "Mission Aborted" before the simulator opens up to allow her exit.
The three Banshees emerge into the huge simulation room where Set is already standing near Rook, their large and imposing droid supply officer.
'Welcome back to reality,' the droid comments, 'I have just been informed that you are to have an hour's break before debriefing. And Lieutenant Paige-Tarkin, it seems there has been a rather unusual delivery for you. It has been moved to storage bay three: they want you to be present when it is opened. Unless you have ordered any exceptionally large items, there is the possibility that the contents may be dangerous, so it has been suggested that the rest of us escort you.'
The droid turns smartly and takes long strides toward the exit, clearly expecting to be followed.

Anazider slides out of the simulated cockpit and removes his helmet, mussing his hair in a fashion that leaves it dashingly tangled. When the others emerge from their simulators, the Prince smiles beatifically while crossing his arms over his chest.
**"Well, that was a little bit of terrible! But such is to be expected, all things considered. Who would like a drink? I know I would."**
As he extends a hand to the side a glass is placed in it by a metal appendage, R0-SE seemingly appearing from nowhere to serve the drink. The small amount of liquid inside coruscates through all the shades of cerulean before Anazider tosses it back. He then sets the glass on the astromech droid's domed surface, not paying it a second glance as Rosey lowers the glass into its internal storage compartment.
Without waiting to see if the others would take him up on his offer, Anazider goes strolling after Rook, his slinking strides easily catching him up to the quartermaster's clunky mechanical ones.

Romana had not been able to see six and twelve become neutralized by the sheer might of the Star Destroyer, but when *Mission Aborted* flashed on her screen before going black she could, without a doubt, have guessed their fates. She knew those controlling the test had seen what little chance she had of destroying the frigate, but still, she wished they'd let her play it out until destroyed or victorious. *Victorious? Could that really be called a victory? Destroying what I needed to protect?* she thought, climbing out of the simulator. She understood that they needed to keep the contents of the frigate from the enemies hands, but still, to her it seemed like the wrong way to do it, even under such circumstances.
She unplugs the data cord from K9, then briefly rubs the top of his dome. *Good boy.* While removing some of her unneeded flight gear, the group of pilots are addressed by Rook. Before she can reply, the looming droid turns and leads the way to her mysterious gift. She can't imagine it being from her mother, as the two have not spoken since her acceptance into the New Republic military. Curiosity is a curious thing though, as she makes a quick step to follow Rook to the delivery.

Chiisuk climbs from the sim, all predatorial grace and fluidity, still under the influence of the adrenaline high and trying to figure out how much damage he could have done from the hangar bay with an almost full payload. He hears the droid's announcement as he catches sight of the princeling, his eyes flashing hot enough to dim the glare from turbolasers. He then proceeds to curse vehemently about the prince's sexual proclivities and those of his ancestors as well as most of his homeworld. He and Jahumba fall in behind Lt. Paige-Tarkin at Jahumba's suggestion that Chiisuk stay as physically far from the prince as possible, lest his temper get the better him. Chiisuk is so unhappy about the outcome of the simulation that he doesn't even notice that he is ranting in Dosh, a fact that Jahumba wisely "forgets" to inform him of.

Rook's heard turns 180 degrees to look back at the Banshees following him without ever slowing his pace. His sensors focus slightly on Chiisuk and he clucks in disapproval.
'*Such language*,' he comments in Dosh, then his left sensor light blinks off and on. A wink? A coincidence? As ever, the squadron's resident droid is demonstrably unusual and enigmatic.
Rook leads the group through the NRI facility, an extremely secure place built within the very bones of Coruscant. The "building" is necessarily peculiar by design, and the cavernous ferrocrete chambers used for storage are at the top. A rapid lift ride and a short walk later, the group are at storage bay three.
One of Rook's fingers pops open at the tip, apparently hinged, and a small scomp link emerges to interface with the terminal by the doors. With a hiss and a whir they open, allowing the small group access to the warren of piled boxes, barrels, and crates beyond.
Four security personnel wait inside by a lone storage unit. The unit looks to be thirty metres long and at least half that wide, and seems to have had all the usual locking devices removed. All that remains is for it to be opened.
'You're Lieutenant Paige-Tarkin right?' The lead security officer asks Romana in the sure tones of someone who knows for certain he is talking to the correct person.
He raps his knuckles on the side of the storage unit.
'This was delivered to Starfighter Command with your name on the recipient line in its delivery log. No record of where it came from. All the usual scans have been performed and we're pretty sure its not a bomb or a live animal or anything like that, but there's still a possibility that the contents are dangerous. Any idea what it is and who might send it to you?'

Romana didn't know what Chiisuk is saying, but listened intently all the same. And when Rook turned to reply, in what she assumed to be Chiisuk's native tongue, she became even more curious. Ultimately, she self-consciously decided against asking, for all she knew he was complaining about having to accompany her to this delivery.
There was no real pomp and circumstance as Rook brought out a scomp link to open the door to Storage Bay 3. The contents of the bay gave Romana a surprise she wasn't expecting. The package was enormous. While she recovers from the initial shock, one of the security personnel addresses her.
**"Yes, I'm Lt. Paige-Tarkin."** She said, to confirm the obvious. **"And to your next questions, no, I can't imagine who would be sending me this, let alone with it is. My family doesn't much approve of my enrollment here, and we haven't spoken for a few years. Perhaps I won something of a lottery?"** She said, being facetious.

'Riiiight,' the man responds, 'well as likely as that sounds let's pretend its still something to be suspicious about as we open it, okay?'
He walks to one of the storage unit's access doors and takes a firm hold of the bar that constitutes its handle. One of his comrades takes up the same position on the opposite door while the other two train their blasters on the unit and whatever is about to be revealed.
'On three. One. Two. Three!'
The doors are flung open, and inside -
A starfighter, or what's left of one. The scarred and battered remains of the craft suggest that when fully assembled it had a dagger-like shape, not dissimilar to the menacing profile of a Star Destroyer though on a much smaller scale.
'What the?' the security officer mutters.
Suddenly his eyes alight on a sheet of flimsiplast stuck to the inside of the door next to him. With a gloved hand the man yanks the sheet away and glances down at whatever is printed on it.
His eyes narrow.
'Its a fixer-upper,' he reads aloud, 'but I know you'll make good use of it. With all my love, your daddy.'

Chiisuk takes on an odd look for a Trandoshan at Rook's admonishment- sheepishness. After seeing the wink, it fades quickly though.
Jahumba retracts his third leg and waddles forward, his domed top swiveling in a narrow arc as he beeps and warbles excitedly.
**"Yessss Jahumba, Chiisssuk isss sssscertain the Lt. and her assstro will let you help if you assssk politely,"** Chiisuk states, hissing a bit more than usual as his mirth at the droid's eagerness takes its toll on his already poor Basic.

Romana is as, if not more, surprised as everyone else after the doors to the container are opened. The pile of junk before her looked as if it had seen too many years of service, followed by too many years of disservice. She couldn't place the make or model, and that in itself intrigued her. As if the discovery of a 'gift' starfighter wasn't too much of a shock, the note attached certainly was. *My father?!?* Eager to see for herself, she approaches the man with the note. **"May I?**"
Chiisuk's R3 brings Romana back to Coruscant with its sounds of excitement. K9 takes offense, and blurts a rude response. More open to the idea of help, Romana replies a bit more kindly. **"We can't very well put it together if we don't know what it is in the first place. This might have to wait awhile,"** she responds with reservations of her own excitement. **"I suppose the ultimate decision is held in the hands of Major Strythe, her or the Captain."**

Set observed the unfolding situation and then decided to add his own comment, "Why would you want to put it back as it was?" He motioned his cybernetic arm towards the hunk of metal which vaguely resembled a snubfighter, "If it ended up in that state I think you'd want to settle for a bit more. Put it together better than it was before?" He took a few steps closer to the broken craft and let out a brief laugh, "It reminds me of me in some ways."

'That's right,' comments the security officer, 'nothing's happening until its all been checked.'

**"Do not worry Jahumba, Chiissssuk doessss not think they can rebuild it by themssssselvesss,"** Chiisuk replies, amused at his droid's disappointment.
On hearing Romana's next words Chiisuk's rather limited facial expression takes on a bewildered cast, **"Flowerssss? Who would want unfilling foodssssstuffssss in place of a ssssship? Even one that looksss like the Princeling flew it? Chiissssuk doesss not undersssssstand."**

That is something I will not do. That scenario had too many limiting factors, like having to stay in our ships, not knowing the situation aboard the frigate, and what we were helping to transport.

**"As well Lieutenant Chiisuk,"** the Prince emphasizes the lieutenant, as if noting that they all were of the same rank, **"if you think that a chain of command would have solved all our problems, then perhaps you should have taken your own advice and learned to adapt without."**
With an exasperated shake of the head and a roll of the eyes, Anazider holds his now empty glass up to the light and watches how the light diffuses through the remnants of the liquor. He shrugs and then sets the glass on top of Rosey's clear domed service, watching as the container sinks into the droid's internal storage.
**"But you are correct in at least one thing: I'm not a Skywalker. I'm better. And with a great deal more style, might I add."**
The nobleman waves flimsy departure and then begins an idle saunter out of the storage bay, intent on the squadron Rec Room. While the meager entertainment offerings were far below adequate for his tastes, it at least offers the possibility of less self-pitying folks to antagonize.

Romana was momentarily put off guard by the discovery of no one behind her, but the shock faded quickly as the rest of the squadron began arguing amongst themselves. The three other pilots were like a confrontational comedy trio she'd seen in old holovids in her youth, however, they weren't nearly as funny. Still, Romana had to suppress a laughter at his highnessness, as it seems his arrogance knows no bounds.
She does agree with Anazider on one thing though, it is time to leave the storage bay. But before she does, she approaches the junker of a ship, and examines it for any sign of a manufacturers insignia or squadron stamp. She looks over the ship, if only briefly, before turning around and leaving the bay. She'd try to search the Holonet, as well as the NRI's databases. If this ship was every sent down an assembly line, she needed to find which one.
With a plan in mind, Romana resorts back to her original idea of getting food. With a whistle to K9, the two leave the ship in the hands of the security officers.

Not being skilled in the arts of witty banter, Chiisuk finds himself in dire need of escape from the bay lest he loose his temper and earn himself a sentence in the brig.
**If only all these other beings healed like I do,** he thinks as he leaves heading for the gym, hoping a punishing workout will drain off enough energy so he can sit through the debriefing.
Before he exits he calls, **"I'm going to the gym, you may stay and aid Lt. Paige-Tarkin if you like, just be sure to be at the debriefing,"** to Jahumba in Dosh, confident the droid could communicate with her in some fashion, which is beneficial in this circumstance since his poor Basic would be terrible in his current mood.
