# [Heart Of Shadows] Chapter 3 (Visiting the Mayor.)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-10 13:58:16)

Vor'en steps out of the embassy and brings up the map on his datapad. He reads that the quickest route would be to cut northwest through the residential area, that should lead to center of the establishment and the office. It will be about a fifteen minute walk he estimates.
Rith looks around cautiously but nonchalantly. Some speeders are passing by the embassy into the desert, and there is the usual crowd forming close to the residential area. However, not many people are close to the embassy.

Awne looks around the area, checking to see if there was anyone seemingly searching for them. Linking her arm in Rith's, and thinking cool thoughts to try and trick her mind; it wasn't working but the thought of swimming in a nice cold pond in her forest was calming. "So Vorr, shall we let you do all the talking?"

"Lets head this way." Vor'en points to the northwest. "Should take us about fifteen minutes." Vor'en pulls out his comm link setting it for Hadru number. "Kid Anwe, Rith and Myself are headed to the Mayor's office, Stay close to the Ambacy as you can we shouldn't be long. Leave your comm on in case we need."
Vor'en looks at Rith and Anwe. "Keep your gaurd up. I am taking point, Anwe after me couple steps behind cover left or right, Rith the rear." "Lets do this." Vor'en starts to move out toward Mayor's office.

"I guess if you want to." Vor'en looks at her. "If you think of anything I don't feel free to ask."

Awne grins as the old soldier takes up command of the small bunch and takes up her position; still keeping her eyes and ears open for anything. Her tail swishes as she walks, keeping off the ground so as not to be stepped on. "Yes sirr."

Awne scans the crowd as the group of 3 forms into a small formation. Awne doesn't detect anyone looking for them, although there are enough people where it could be hard to tell if she is being watched.
You begin walking through the residential area, which is small buildings of hardened sand. They seem to be of an adobe-style make and most of them have domed or flat roofs. The homemakers seem to be running daily errands, and the younglings are playing in the streets that separate the houses. As you move in a very military fashion, the people seem to watch you a little bit. You walk through the residential area for about six minutes. You pass by two buildings on your right and you hear a cry coming from the alley.
Young Girl: "Help me! I broke my leg while running, someone get me to my mother!"

Hearing the little girl cry out for help, Vor'en truns and starts to move toward her motioning to Rith and Awne to cover the roof and the entrance and exit points. "It's ok little one, where is your mother at and we will take you to her?" With his free hand he pulls out a med pack to check her injurys.
(OCC: The E-11 is out as always. He is currently holding it one handed.)

### **zerah** (2008-03-10 16:37:24)

Awne keeps a watch on the roof and the exits, while looking over to the girl; she didn't want to make another mistake like last time, and runs through all of her training to sense a trap.

Vo'ren runs briskly into the dark shade of the alley. You see windows lining the two long houses and two doorways, there are two durasteel trash compactors on the left side of the alley. The compactors are for each house you imagine. Vor'en can hear the sound behind one of the trash compactors. He goes behind it to spot an audio recording unit in a pile of junk and steel.
The message plays again.
Young Girl: "Help me! I broke my leg while running, someone get me to my mother!"
Before Awne can react to Vor'en running into the alley, she senses that this is definitely a bad move. She can spot two people in the right house, in the second floor window, they are wielding blaster rifles.
You hear screaming from a distance down the alleyway.
Voice at the end of the alley: "Try to take them alive!"
*Awne can act during the surprise round, roll initiative. The only targets visible to you are the ones in the windows. Rith's initiative 25.*

Awne curses and draws her blaster aiming for one of the men and firing. "It's a trrap! Rright house! second floorr two of them! Rrifles!!"

*Awne's initiative 8; Vor'en's initiative 20. Vor'en has also spotted the attackers on the right and he may act in the surprise round.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-10 19:29:51)

Rith hears the shouting and realizes something bad is about to happen, he runs into the alley to assist Vor'en. He sees the armed assailants and takes cover behind the large compactor.
As Vor'en analyzes the recording unit, he hears something land next to his foot. A stun grenade. Just as soon as he sees it a blinding flash hits him and he feels energy rip through his body. *Vor'en takes 13 stun damage.*
Vor'en regains his bearings and takes aim at one of the two assailants in separate windows. He lets a burst of automatic fire loose to an enemy. Much to Vor'en's surprise, his trusty E-11 slightly overheats and locks up after the fifth shot. The attacker managed to get cover as the blaster bolts carved holes in the side of the building, just narrowly missing the window opening.
The assailant pops back up to the window, and fires a stun blast directly at Vor'en. It strikes him directly on his face. Vor'en collapses unconscious.  *You took 40 damage from a critical. You are -5 on the condition track as well.*
Assailant: "I got 'em!"
Assailant 2: "Great, I'll get the next one."
The second window is filled with the outline of another assailant. This one fires a stun blast at
Rith. The bolt strikes him in the chest as he is attempting to use the compactor for cover. He is knocked over and seems visibly shaken as he barely manages to get back up. Awne commands to call for support to Rith.
Rith: "Copy that!"
Awne quickly points her pistol in the direction of the window, firing at the attacker. The bolt strikes him in the chest and she watches him collapse out of sight.
Rith pulls out his comlink and talks into it, "We need backup! Unknown amount of enemies with blasters/stun grenades. Trace us to this call signal, we are in a alley!". With his free hand he fires into the next window, but the shot goes wide and impacts next to the opening.
A Snivvian armed with an odd looking blaster pistol dashes out from behind the compactor opposite to Rith's position. He is in a red combat jumpsuit, and seems to be armed professionally. He takes cover behind a rock 3 squares in front of Awne.
The lone attacker in the window moves to the opening where his partner had fallen. He brings up his blaster rifle and fires down on Awne. *She suffers nine stun damage.*
Awne brings her pistol down toward the Snivvian behind the rock. She fires and he quickly ducks behind cover as the bolt flies over his head harmlessly. Awne growls and runs up to him, face to face. The Snivvian snorts and bears his crooked teeth as he prepares himself for close combat.
Rith looks down his pistol sights and fires at the thug; the shot goes wide and punches a hole in the wall.
Rith: "I'll try to bug this shooter in the window!"
The Snivvian growls as he brings his advanced-looking blaster around, pointing at Awne's stomach. She grabs his wrist, attempting to abate the barrel away. She cannot push the blaster away and he discharges a stun bolt directly into her stomach. *Awne suffers seventeen damage and moves -2 on the condition track.*
The attacker rallies behind the Snivvian's hit and attempts to shoot Awne. The stun blast misses the melee pair completely.
Awne holds onto the Snivvian's wrist, trying to disarm his blaster. She fails to shake it from his grip as he fires a loose stun blast into the air.
Rith continues to aim down his sights, squaring the front sight post on the chest of the attacker as he is aiming at Awne. He delivers a well-placed shot to the chest, and the attacker collapses over.
The Snivvian shouts out loud, "REINFORCEMENTS!!! We've almost got them!"
While Awne attempts to control the Snivvian's wrist, he fires another stun blast into Awne's torso.*Awne suffers eight stun damage.*
Awne takes a swing at the Snivvian with her free hand, claws protruding from her furry digits.
The Snivvian dodges and maintains positive control on Awne's wrist.
Just then, the door on the left house slides open, and two Gammoreans storm out with stun batons activated.
Rith shouts to Awne as he spots the Gammoreans rushing to assist the Snivvian.
Rith: "On your left!"
Rith takes a breath and brings his DL-18 up, firing a shot and placing the bolt directly in the Gammorean's stomach. The Gammorean collapses over right in the middle of the doorway as his companion crawls over him.
The Snivvian twirls his arm around, breaking free of Awne's wrist. He pushes her back just a bit and then fires a stun blast into her chest. She feels the stun energy wear down on her nervous system as she fades in and out of consciousness. *You take 22 stun damage and move -2 on the condition track.*
The Gammorean runs next to the Snivvian, with his stun baton at the ready. He focuses on Awne.
Awne brings her blaster up to shoot the Snivvian in the chest but he deflects the weapon, and a bolt discharges into the Snivvian's thigh as he grimaces in pain.
Rith realizes that firing a shot into the close combat would endanger Awne. He sprints from behind the trash compactor and gets in between the Gammorean and the Snivvian.
The small Snivvian watches as the Gammorean attempts to hit Awne with the stun baton. He doesn't seem to worry about firing in between the Gammorean and Awne. *Precise shot.* He fires another stun blast into Awne's chest, waiting for her to go down. *Awne takes 13 stun damage, and moves -2 on the condition track.*
The Gammorean jabs the stun baton into Awne's side, and the last thing she hears is Rith shouting her name as she goes unconscious. *You move -5 on the condition track.*

"Sithspawn!!" Vor'en screams. Switching to autofire on his E-11 he points the blaster at the window and fires. "You will have to do better then that Hutt slime!!"

Awne gasps as Vor'en goes down, and looks over breifly when Rith is hit, she draws her blaster while she speaks "Rrith! get out to coverr and call forr help!! I'll get Vorr!" She levels her blaster up to the window and fires. "Keep them frrom shooting!"

Awne growls at the blast and looks to the rock and the shooter behind it; she'd deal with the window in a minute right now she had buisness to take care of. she levels her blaster at the shooter behind the rock and fires at him, then rushes foreward, hoping to catch him off guard and give Rith a better shot if she missed.
*1d20+7 DMG 3d6+1*

### **zerah** (2008-03-11 18:10:49)

Awne growls, trying to push the pain back and regain her strength; she grabs his gun and attempts to disarm him.
*2 swifts to recover, 1d20+4, you don't need the dmg part right?*

## Re: Chapter 3 (Visiting the Mayor.)

### **zerah** (2008-03-11 20:08:59)

Awne winces from the pain but doesn't let up, willing the pain away while she slashes at the Snivvian with her claws, praying that help would come soon and that Vor was alright.
*2 swifts to recover, (now -1 on the condition track 2 more swifts needed to recover completely) Natural Claws: 1d20+4 DMG 1d8+3*

Awne pants, trying to clear her vision. She levels her blaster at the Snivvian and fires, tired of the thing still shooting at her.

Awne's eyelids crack open ever so slightly, she can see the Snivvian and a few others tossing Rith into a speeder. After that they toss Vor'en in. Her eyes slip close again as she goes head first into darkness.
