# [Into the Storm] Final Chapter (Korriban)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-02-13 20:08:44)

The group shifted from the windy night of Thule to a colder location that they were unsure of. Apparently, they had been relocated instantly in a stomach wrenching experience...
Everyone quickly takes in the new surroundings with awe. You were gathered atop a hard stone, summit like building. The stone floor you stood on was elevated by long winding stairs that approached the ceremonial style gathering area. The gathering area overlooked a dusty rock valley and it was obvious this place was used for auditory purposes to address a great mass of people. The whole group were in the focal point of the open ceremonial building. Elegant torches lit up the night brightly. There was a small audience gathered in front of the group on the platform.
There was a man clad in black robes and ancient Red Sith mask. Some of you knew him as Darth Strife. Another person was a strikingly beautiful young woman with brownish/red hair that is long and to her shoulders. She bore piece yellow and red eyes with a white face, like clean ivory. Her uniform was composed of a brown tunic with black trim, and a brown Jedi robe on the outside of her form. The woman's pants were tucked neatly into her boots and she was wearing black gloves that seem to have a few tears in them. Although she still had signs of beauty, her face was mired with signs of rotting flesh. There was also a red-skinned bipedal human with 4 hard tentacle like appendages coming from its face (Sith Species; Knowledge check to confirm). He was dressed in scholarly black robes and held a book. Behind this small group, was an elevated platform with an altar, flanked by 4 ornamental torches. The Sith in scholar robes was apparently preaching to a mass of 30,000 other creatures that were standing in the rock valley 150 meters away. They were difficult to see but torches lit up their red faces in the darkness of the open valley.
The crowd of 30,000 crazed people were shouting loudly at the group who had just teleported on the summit structure. Seemingly, the warped group was the attention of 30,000 people and Strife's gathering.
In the piercing black night on the summit, Strife waited for the Sith to stop speaking and he faced the group. He spoke as cold fog emanated from his mouth.
Darth Strife: "Welcome! To the time to end all times. Tonight, we initiate balance to the Force! ... The galaxy shall know peace forever more... The Domitoris has graced us with her presence, answering our prayers... She will usher in an age of eternal bliss and peace... Now, show your allegiance and BOW BEFORE HER!"
The Sith in robes looked into his book and then translated to the legion of followers. His voice was raspy with a lot of clicks in it. Once he finished Strife's translation; they let out a rabid roar of applause. The sounds of the crowd were awe inspiring and deafening. Fear of the unknown could be welling up in the stomachs of Red Team. The legion then kneeled in a sacred offering of submission toward Awne.
You all also notice that Lues and Feldon were standing with you. Strangely, Lance and Jocen were also here.
Feldon: "What.....what in the name of the Force is this?"

The new surroundings immediatley caught Natirash off balance, and he stumbled slightly, Looking around the room he immediatley knew his team was outnumbered. Although the throngs of creatures appeared to be crazed, they werent attacking for the moment so he contented himself with just watching, whatever was going on here was probably important information and he made a mental notes of everything he saw and heard.

The white light clears and his stomach settles. Then he sees where he is. *"This is not good."* He thinks to himself. He quickly snaps into action. "Red Team defensive premitter 360 now! Knights in the middle cover don't let him near Awne!" Vor'en takes front, weapon rasied and ready. "You come near her and I will end you Sithspawn!" Every word was filled with anger and seriousness. He would not let Stife any where near her.

A top the outdoor stone summit, Vor'en instructed his men to take a perimeter. There wasn't much room on the stage to make a security position. The two Privates looked at Vor'en nervously as the Lieutenant issued the countermanding order. Once Strife could see the increased readiness posture, he just calmly replied...
Darth Strife: "Lower your weapons, there needn't be any violence on this day. This is a grand occasion, one that is beyond your expectations. Just relax and lets continue with the Ritual."
Natirash scoured the rock valley and looked at the people. They seemed to be warriors armed with a sort of archaic melee weapon. There was no way Red Team would win a fight against these odds. Most notably, Mur Eva and Strife were definitely capable at inflicting heavy losses on the group.

Looking back at Vor'en " Honestly It doesnt really matter how much you hate him, right now we're completely at a tactical disadvantage, theres no way we could win this fight and the fact is that we're still alive speaks alot, if he wanted us dead there isn't a thing we could do about it. Our mission objectives are not to stop the threat but to identify it, and you starting a fight when we're outnumbered 5000 to 1 isnt going to solve anything, so Corporal I'm ordering you to lower your weapon, unless you want the death of everyone in this team haunting you from the grave."

The new venue and the worshiping to boot was not quite what the farghul would have wished for. "This rreally isn't necessarry.." she calls up to the Sith before turning to vor'en first beside her "It's alrright Vorr...that's Murr up therre....she took me to him, he's...not quite as bad as I had thought..."
She looks down to the silent Ewok, in shock no doubt, idly she pets his head lightly before looking over to her master, moving to him "Masterr you'rre herre! isn't this strrange?" she motions to the crystal beside her "this little thing seems to have picked me...they say I'm to brring the balance that was prromised."

The Dark Lord looked to Ludin and asked a question in Sith. The prophet then handed a hard bound flimsiplast book to Strife. He flipped through the pages and held his hand up in exclamation in his discovery.
Darth Strife: "The sacred texts read that:
The Domitoris shall answer the prayers with the sight of the Kissaen. And when the Electus comes, they will be close to the Domitoris. Those who are close to the Domitoris shall not know death, but a long life of servitude to the one. Those who witness the Domtiroris's acension shall also be its guardians.
Darth Strife: "So I see that you are the ones that are destined to be by her side. You will be her protector for the time it takes her to ascend! That is why you have appeared here with her, regardless of the reason you willed to follow her."
The robed Sith prophet then translates to the legion of followers and they hush in careful contemplation.

Darth Strife nods his head in disappointment. He simultaneously addressed Kayli and Vor'en.
Lord Strife: "The label of good and evil serves no purpose here. We are simply carrying out the Will of the Force, as we perceive it. By their prayers, your friend has been summoned to complete the Ritual of Ascension. These people have guarded the Kissaen Crystal, which is a physical manifestation of the Force. It has existed since the beginning of time, and many people believe it is direct link from the Force to our physical world. If the crystal had not been discovered, no one in this galaxy would of discovered how to use the Force. We would have the potential, but no understanding. It was the discovery on how to use the Force, and from the crystal, the knowledge has been passed down. There is no limit to the power of the crystal, which has brought us to this day of 7800 BBY on Korriban."
He gestured toward the living crystal, which was orbiting very slowly around Awne.
Darth Strife: "And as prophesized, there would only be one who could link from the physical world directly into the Force. This link would be established through the Kissaen crystal. Awne has the capability to absorb its knowledge through her rare affliction. She is like a Void in the Force, all energy passes through her in infinite amounts. This was caused by her linking of the soul with Rith Bendar. Who channeled extreme amounts of Dark energy to sever his own memory to hide from me. When Awne and Rith embraced they brought together pure good and pure evil, creating a devastating rapture in the Force. Arguably, the Force has chosen Awne in her moment of true balance to link directly through the Kissaen crystal. And I used Falsoor to create my clone army to generate such an unbalance in the Force to throw anyone off of Awne's actions. So that I could keep her protected and secret from any non-believers."
The Sith Lord took a moment to capture everyone's responses to this and continued speaking...
Darth Strife: "So your commitment to her is very much appreciated. She will embrace the crystal and absorb its intended knowledge. For she is the only one who has been elected by the Force to handle its Will. As she goes through Ascension, you will keep her safe. When she is reborn, she will bring balance to the Force. She will be the Force."
Lues seemed shocked considerably as he looked amongst the ranks of his friends.
Lues: "That's what happened to my memory. I have no memory of being trained by a Sith. Don't listen to his lies! This is an illusion! The Dark Lord is a master of deception..."

Kaz'jee stared with an open maw, in shock and horror. "So then what you say....is all things were a lie? You raped a woman for a lie?" The small Ewok had known many things to be hard on his mind, but now this had gone too far. Still, he remains calm while looking up to the Farghul, taking hold of her hand and says quietly to the Sith...though still loud enough to be heard. "No more lies...done with lies...Whatever plan is you have...Count Kaz'jee out. He will stay to be with Awne...but no more will Kaz'jee follow a lie. How we even know you tell the truth now?! What reason is there??" Shaking his head he puts a calm hand on the hilt of his blaster pistol. "In Kaz'jee opinion...You nothing more than a pile of fodder...A disease...Stupid plans full of stupid lies and holes. As said though..." the Ewok says while wrapping things up, "Kaz'jee will only stay with Awne because....because...because he love her."

Awne looks down to the little Ewok beside her, giving his hand a small squeeze "thank you Kaz...it's okay though.." she looks up to the woman in front of her addressing them both and the others as well "It is..rreally. The crrystal didn't hurrt me and as a void in the forrce it explains my blackouts and the times when..I've not been myself." She looks over to her master "It's also why my arrm rregrrew."
"I'm fine." she nods to the woman, stern looking to her and determined "Murr's up therre...she seems to trrust him and I trrust herr, if she's forrgiven him forr what he did to herr motherr than...I suppose that it's." she nods and releases the Ewoks hand to move up again, pausing to turn to her master "Masterr you underrstand it all...don't you?" It's now she looks uncertain, her master had never steered her wrong and had done his best to teach her right, but now she needed to know he understood if no one else did.

The small Ewok reaches up to grasp her hand again before moving in front of her with eyes wide and his vice quivering. "Awne no understand...How...how can -anything- about what happened be good...?" He looks for a moment before easing back down and lets go of her hand. "Kaz'jee...-love- love you....Will -never- trust Sith man..." He then unholsters his blaster and just holds it in his hands now...all sorts of possible actions forming in his head, as the strain of this reality seemed to be taking its toll on him.

Feldon looked around, not wavering at all in his conversation.
Feldon Azrik: "You're saying that Awne is to bring balance to the Force? How do we know this isn't some conjuration you've used through your powers? That is blasphemy! Luke Skywalker has brought balance to the Force. And this cannot be real because the Sith species are extremely rare, seeing them in this number is unfathomable."
The robed Sith looked to Vor'en, Kaz, and then to Kayli.
Darth Strife: "They are believing it young Jedi. Why can't you? They will stand by her side, and for good reason. Surely you have see her knowledge of the Force in motion... and how can you deny she isn't the prophesized one? And you would call this balance?!"
The Sith made a quick snap back to Mur Eva and then Red Team.
Darth Strife: "Look in your heart and tell me if you think the galaxy has balance! War and suffering have persisted for ages, regardless of the Jedi and Sith's pointless disputes. The Force isn't in harmony, only the noble-minded Jedi use it for their purposes. They disrupt the Force by not allowing evil within it. The Force doesn't condemn evil, it understands it's necessary for a complete galaxy. Love cannot exist without hate...pleasure can not exist without pain. You standing against evil is irrelevant, it's all part of the big picture. And if you all shall remain in disbelief, then how did the crystal warp you to 7800 BBY on the planet Korriban? There is no Jedi in the galaxy capable of this power through the Force. Non-belief in the Kissaen's crystal is absurd as its power has been demonstrated."
Suddenly, Strife is interrupted by another flash of energy to similar to Awne's warp event that happened on Thule. It was strange....because Awne's father was standing right in front of Red Team. He turned around in shock and noticed his daughter after looking across the small group.

The robed Massassi looked to Strife when the flash happened and an older human male appeared. This was not an event he had anticipated. Without much more hesitation he moves forward with a plan.
The The time to move forward was now. Nuk could sense the hesitation in the Domtiroris' voice and some of the Electus were also bending to the sway of Lord Strife. Picking up a medium sized steel box, he moves towards the Domtiroris. His moves are slow and as unintimidating as he can manage. The non-Sith, Nuk has met in the past were always weak spirited and frightened easy in his presence. He hoped the Domtiroris would not show any of this fear.
Moving a few paces past Strife, Ludis sets the box down and opens it facing the Domtiroris. The first item he pulls out is the black steel armor, traditional to every Sith. He lays it down just to the side of the box and proceeds to pull out a black cape, another traditional item. This is folded quickly by Nuk and set on top of the armor. The last item to come out of the box is a Lightsabre. The distance to Nuk was too great to get a decent look at the Sabre, but anyone who paid close attention to it, knew it was not anything a Jedi would ever use. The coloration and shape were purely Sith in origin.
Closing the box and standing up, Nuk silently points to the Domtiroris, then he points at the items that had just been layed out. "Yours." He takes a step back and waits. This gesture having three purposes. The first was to distract the Domtiroris form her companions with these gifts of good faith. The second purpose was to put himself between the more vocal of the Electus and Lord Strife. The third and final purpose is to allow Nuk to get closer to Domtiroris so if any of her Electus decide they want to abduct her, he could intervene quicker.

"You say that crystal hovering around Awne is the origin of the Force. Then I say we're better off without it!" Kayli calls out, turning around to look Strife right in the face. "No Force means No Jedi, and No Sith. We're better off without the whole lot. History is full of wars that were started because of your "Traditions." How many times were the Jedi hunted to near extinction by the Sith, and Vice Versa. And how many times will it happen again? No. If you want to bring "Balance" To anything, why not Destroy that crystal and see how the Universe evolves without the Force."
"You Hear that Awne! If you really want Balance, Destroy that crystal floating around you. No Jedi, No Sith, No Force. And then we would never have come to this point." Kayli called back the the Furghul.

The masked man looked down and sighed heavily. He spoke in a compassionate tone that let you know he was passionate about his cause.
Darth Strife: "My dear, calm yourself. I want balance as you do. I despise the conflicted traditions as you do. But, destroying the crystal will not help anything. I'm saying that the Domitoris must undertake the Ritual of Ascension. Once she does this, her ability will go beyond that of any known creature. She will do what she needs to do to bring a utopia throughout the galaxy. So then you might say... we are in agreement...we are better off without the petty traditions."

Awne felt like she was outside herself, outside this whole situation with the warped being standing in front of her. She had thought it would be years longer before she would see her father again but there he stood before her as though the time they had been apart hadn't passed. That man was full of secrets she knew but how he could pass in time and age and only have a bit of grey to show for it was beyond her.
He had said once it was good genes, it was times with that in mind she wished she had been of those genes. But daughter in spirit and soul she would always be to him and maybe some of those genes would amerce to her in osmosis.
But she was sidetracking herself. She knew that something..most likely a someone, had moved and set things in front of her, that shiny saber catching her eye for only a second; she knew the woman was harping on something....her mind was gone she had no idea anymore what was going on; she knew the sith...could she still call him that? he was explaining, or...trying to at least; and she knew her master was...upset...to say the least.
None of that mattered, none of it at all, all that mattered to her was that her father was in front of her and she could see home; half of her, the fairly logical part knew that she wasn't home and it was only her imagination but it let the other half have it's wish for now and allow the brief moment of fantasy. She moved to him, bypassing gifts and people to move up to her father, poke his shoulder once as her tail puffed and swayed; he was real...
He smiled, oh she had missed him smiling, how long had it been now? the days and months had all blurred together, it didn't matter. In a simple heartbeat she was clinging, as though her life depended on it to her father, all at once becoming a cub again and latching onto him; the sane one, the strong one, the one that taught her all she knew about fighting; all that mattered was him and this feeling of home she felt. "I missed you.." she mumbles softly.

The small Ewok's head was starting to hurt with a dull pain in the back and the front of his skull...hells he hurt all around his head. He heard the Jedi master...the sith...and Kayli but none of it seemed to register anymore now that he was thinking on the blaster that layed in his hands.
Then suddenly the man appeared, and as he saw Awne move towards him...and take the moment in, he knew then that it was definately someone from her life that she cared deeply for. But this didnt phase him...really it could very well be some cruel illusion done by the Sith...At least Kaz'jee wouldn't put it past him. He remained silent throughout this before deciding that now would be the best time...if there ever was one. It was either use that dreadful weapon in his hands....or return home.
He gazes now upon the Farghul and her father, giving the man a soft nod if he ever noticed, and said softly to Strife. "....Kaz'jee wish to go home. Can no longer take part in this...if Sith brought man here...can send Kaz'jee back, yes?" Looking to the others he gives a salute before putting the blaster to his own head, tears streaming down his face. "Kaz'jee...cannot take this any further or longer than he has...He has hurt...still hurts, lost friends...and is tired..." He takes a few breaths as his furry digit rests on the trigger, ready to squeeze if his request was denied. "Kaz'jee will not stay to see Awne do whatever ritual people have in mind...Kaz'jee want to remember Awne the way she was when her and Kaz'jee met...When he fell in love. Would rather die than to watch her become some plot device for the universe...Shame Jedi and Sith ever came into being..." He now locks eyes onto the Farghul he so desperately cared for and had grown to respect. "Awne do what Awne wants....not what other people tell her to do...Kaz'jee feels sorry for you, haveing choice, no...not choice. A choice is when you make your own decision...but people have made decision for you without eve asking what Awne wants...Kaz'jee feels sorry that this was thrust upon her...without even so much as a moment to even think...a true moment...by herself, with no one around." Looking now back to Strife he says with renewed resolve. "Either you send Kaz'jee away....or he does it himself. Either way...Kaz'jee wants time to tell Awne goodbye."

Nuk hadn't been worried about the words of the Domtiroris' Electus. The human female had passionate words, but they were not strong enough to get through to the Domtiroris.
The human male had some words as well, but they were not meant to stop the Domtiroris from going through the Ascension. He had resigned himself to the will of the moment.
The small fuzzy one had just become a possible problem though. It's seeming willingness to destroy itself could distract the Domtiroris from the Ascension. Something had to be done, but Nuk wasn't sure what. Without turning or moving his eyes off the small creature, Nuk sends the prophet Ludin a question through the force. "Guidance?"

Vor'en looks at Strife. All of his talk about balance and peace was insane. There would never be peace in the galaxy war is part of life. He had learned this lesson well. "Force or not there will always be war Strife. It can't be helped, it is part of the galaxy and life people will always fight to save or destroy. I don't fight at her side cause she is a Jedi, I do it cause she is my friend and I care for her force powers or not. So as I see it this will change nothing." Turning to look at Awne then back to Strife. "If this is what she wants then I will not interfere in what is to happen, but if this is a trick there will be no where or no one in this galaxy that will stop me from finding you and ending your life." He meant every word of what he said. Strife had better not being trying to trick Awne or he would end him.

Darth Strife pleads with the young ewok.
Darth Strife: "This is for her glory. She will be able to bring the galaxy to a state of bliss in the likes we have never seen... Why would you turn your back on her in this moment of triumph? It is what she wishes."
While this was going on, Awne's father returned her hug. He look very confused as the Sith was speaking to the group.
Darth Strife: "But now, her group looks sufficient. Her closest friends and family will bear witness to the Ascension and shall keep her safe."
The black-robed figure took off his mask and revealed a white face to Red Team. He had a rugged face and showed some signs of the Dark side taint, but not as bad as Mur Eva. It was Corlen Doris, former headmaster of the Telares Station. This station was orbiting Tatooine when Awne, Woroken, and Vor'en first met. He had worked for Falsoor exclusively but no doubt had been a Sith covertly. Feldon stepped forward in a defiant motion.
Feldon Azrik: "You..! I see now why you wear that mask. My master had presumed right to start an investigation on Falsoor. A Sith was amongst their ranks."
Darth Strife: "Do not let my title fool you. While I did commit to atrocious acts, I did more good deeds than you and Mr. Lues will every accomplish! And you know this! Rather than study and be Skywalker's puppet I was out redeeming the helpless."
Lues Van seemed taken aback by Strife's statement.
Darth Strife: "You still can't remember me Lues? I trained you back when I was with the Praxeum. That power you unleashed on yourself was very effective. Fortunately, that power created such a sickness in the Force that allowed Awne to become the catalyst to change things forever. Your perverse use of the Force combined with her brilliance sparked a new power to be wielded."
He looked back toward the Sith Prophet. The human placed his hand on his shoulder and stated in Basic and then aloud in Sith.
Darth Strife: "Begin the Rite Of Ascension."
The crowd let out a fervent applause. Then they began praying in a solemn tone. With this, the prophet began reading from his texts. All the while, Darth Strife was translating for Red Team. The atmosphere was quite and slightly eerie at the approaching event. The pyres were lit up across the valley like a foreboding ceremony. Strife's words capitalized on the uneasy aura.
Darth Strife: “One shall come from all paths. Ye shall stand united but ready to divide for one. The one is the electus. The electus is the one above all others proven by the path. All shall believe in the balance, but this one will shape balance at its will. Ye who live unto this day will not know balance, only the electus and beyond will . . .
The one is the electus domitoris. Life must exist with chaos. The domitoris shall bring upon thee both. Then ye shall know balance. If thou art the domitoris, seek in your heart, and take what our sacred offerings as you please. In your name we find balance eternally. Ye are the life and death. . . ye are the force. The force has chosen, and ye shall bless us with love and hate. The force can do no wrong…
For those who read…step forward if ye believe. Faith will guide the one. If ye bare the offerings, ye are the electus.”
So it could be interpreted that Awne was going to bring forth destruction and peace. But it seemed she would be taking on a status similar to a deity. This was the prompt for the group to step toward the altar if they wanted to protect Awne. Awne was to step forward if she would accept her dark ceremonial armor from the hulking Sith bodyguard and then begin the Ritual. Regardless, everyone had to choose whether or not they would support Awne's transformation.

Kaz'jee glares at the Sith as he calls back to him, fury in his voice. "All Kaz'jee has is your word...Words that he does not trust. Kaz'jee will do what he must...and right now Kaz'jee wanted to tell Awne goodbye and didnt get to because you started the stupid ritual in first place! If Galaxy needs peace...why couldnt it wait just a few minutes more?" he then calls out to Awne, in a serious tone that he had not used before...but also seemed as if he was pleading. "Awne...Come say goodbye to kaz'jee before doing ritual thing...K...Kaz'jee doesnt want to see it happen...Loves you as you are now...If...If Awne changes, Kaz'jee wont have anything left...except home...or death..."

Awne glances up as the Ewoks words reach her, amidst the words of the sith of what this ritual would bring, of what to do, and of...destruction and peace? How..would that help the galaxy? peace...she had thought for sure that the one that would bring balance would be the one to unite the Sith and Jedi in the force; talk to them, show them that if she could live well with both sides running through her veins and body that they could get along easily...
Her eyes close, ears folding back into her hair as she hides her face in her fathers shoulder, relax...think...peace...calm...tranquil...
"You know what is best, you've gone from caring for yourself, to caring for others in the way that was depicted for you..for all Jedi. You are trapped, between yourself and others. I won't tell you what I think is best, this…is a choice you need to make."
Her father was always wise to her, wise in general but she always thought he was wiser than he let on. Looking up to him faintly, he smiles to her, and gently moves an arm to over her ears, blocking the words and actions going on, giving her...
Silence...muffled silence but silence none the less.
She sighs softly, closing her eyes and relaxs, trusting her father to old her up in the event her legs left her.
Trees...grass...flowers...relax...go home...
Her mind travels the distance to her inner place of sanctuary, her home the woods where she loved to stay and mediate.
Peace..
quiet...
Now to think...
Her thoughts were wrong...she should have asked to be clear...that's in the past, move to the next. Destruction and Peace...destruction to bring peace...to bring order to the galaxy and unite...by force? Perhaps she had been wrong then...so much like that Empire she had read on...Black armor...black saber...like that dark armored one that stood beside the destruction in the past...the one that Master Skywalker had bested.
Was that to be her fate? to take his place? to create a new Empire? to be one that would force others to bow to her will?
..was that what she wanted? the saber was pretty...
but...to do that...to force others to bend to her will...that wasn't what her master taught her..
What would Woro do...he was so much better than her in this...Woro...he wouldn't want to hurt anyone...he'd sooner run and keep everyone safe..
Then again...if she did this...she could protect them...
Lorhas...he died to keep them safe...to stop Strife...was Mur being controlled?
Her eyes open, moving a hand to her fathers arm to move it, nuzzling his cheek lightly before turning to the Ewok, moving to his side and gently lowering the weapon, petting his head gently. She looks to the group, then back to the chanting ones and strife above. She looks to the gifts and then her father "I like my saberr.." she says quietly.
Looking down to the Ewok she hugs him "Lets get you home okay?" She takes his hand and moves back towards her master "I think it's time we got out of herre Masterr...I...would verry much like to speak with Masterr Skywalkerr if we can gain an audience." She looks over to the crystal and taps it faintly "Shoo."

Kaz'jee had kept his weapon at his head while she started to think. He had even started to pray against all odds that she not go through with this plan...and then...as if ordained by some obscure deity, she denied it all. When she lowered his weapon, he holstered it and hugged her back as tears of joy ran down from his eyes and onto his fur...and even getting a bit on the Farghul. He happily looks up through his tears and shakes his head quickly "Kaz'jee no go home...Has Awne the way hes always known her...No need to go back yet...Kaz'jee want to stay with Awne, if...if she will let him?" He was hopeful, then again he wouldnt blame her for telling him he needed to go back...He had afterall...just shown a moment of instability.
A thought strikes him before saying quickly, forgetting the others around her could hear him still. "If...if Awne make kaz'jee go home...She at least stay for a party maybe...?"

Kaz'jee's ears perk up at Vor'ens words. "You asking...if she sure she want to go home...? Or asking if she sure that she not want dark ritual...Awne made up her mind on last part...she no want that." he squeezes her hand tightly, letting her know that he would do all he could to defend her latest choice.
Next was Kayli...While it was true they were a few long years from their own, he had to agree that they could just as easily try and find a place to live here. Awne's father was here with her...An idea forms in his head. "Lets live here Awne! Awne's father come with us..and...and all us can live here in this time? This of course unless...unless -can- go back..." He looks over to Kayli and gives a grin "Lady come too if no go back to own time...yes?"

Who's to say what is good orr not." She continues to pet the Ewok lightly on the head, she wasn't quite sure how to respond to his confession of love so for now she kept silent about it, she really hadn't thought of him like that and if she were to be his Master...provided the council didn't find her unfit, then those emotions would be inappropriate.
She glances to the other three "We may be in anotherr time but...I do have morre powerr.." she looks to the crystal, evenif it took it all from her she might have enough to at least try to get them home. She looks around "Well...we could also find a nice planet." she frowns "though..I have wanted to speak to Masterr Skywalkerr." She looks over to her master "Masterr? how would one send us home?"

Feldon shook his head and tried to smile at Awne.
Feldon: "I do not even know where we are, much less how to get out."
Corlen Doris paced about, seemingly patient with the unfolding events. He was able to break up the tension of waiting for the next move slightly.
Darth Strife: "You do realize, that the prescribed events will come to pass regardless of your choices? The Force has wonderful times planned for us...and your saying you do not want to be the herald of these times? Destruction is prophesized, but whose to say things won't be different when your in power? You shall rule all by the will of the Force, and you can do no wrong! And in time, the galaxy could destroy itself either way. There may come a time when the galaxy will be unredeemable, and you could be the one to give it mercy! We can go by the sacred texts, but who knows what will happen when your in control?"
Feldon stepped forward from the group.
Feldon Azrik: "This isn't right. The Force doesn't wish upon us destruction! We are the masters of our own fate! Awne has chosen right to reject your deal."
Darth Strife: "You can only control so much... and this isn't my deal! This is the Force, choosing her!"
Feldon Azrik: "How do you know? Are you attuned so well?"
Darth Strife: "Perhaps not...but I have faith! I believe completely in what I'm doing... I use the Force to bring peace! You use it to delay the inevitable and prolong suffering for your blind values!"
Feldon Azrik: "I believe in what I'm doing as well. I shall pursue what I know is right."
Darth Strife: "Even if your very soul, the Force, is against it?"
Feldon: "The Force has chosen my path, and I shall follow."
The Sith Lord sighed disappointedly.
Darth Strife: "Religious fervor, it is the unraveling of worlds and people alike. It's sad the one thing to bring us together is the one that shall destroy us. But it's funny, you seem so sound to follow the Jedi Code, as counter-productive as it is. But, your friend seems uncertain."
Feldon looked to Lues and noticed he had a deep face of contemplation and confusion on his face.
Lues Van: "I'm fine...let's find a way out of here. We've better things to do."
The Sith Lord smiled, he pointed in Awne's direction.

Darth Strife: "I can see this isn't what your group wants. That's fine. If you wish to leave, go ahead...and I wish you God speed. The Force will take its chosen path regardless of your decision. And I only tried to kill her because if she can be killed, then she isn't the Domitoris. For the Domitoris cannot perish. Do as you all please, and I bid you peace."

She breathes deeply, wondering if simple thought of the ebb and flow of the force would work; she thinks of home...rather...the planet they had left their ship on, she thought of the planet, the ship, the winged creatures, and all of them, the pack and called to the force to take them home.

The Kissaen Crystal hummed and floated towards Awne receptively. Like a trained pet responding to its master. The farghul extended both of her paws forward, grasping the silvery crystal. She noticed the "organ" in the crystal began pumping very quickly as she held it. Awne felt her paws stuck to the living crystal as if it was covered in adhesive. A beam of white light shot from the crystal and surrounded Awne in a brilliant aura. The crystal then hovered above the altar and began floating, extending its power to the farghul in a stream of white energy. The energy pulse was powerful and loud, it was vibrating the farghul apprentice violently. The stone stage that you all resided upon endured a great crack that went down the stairwell into the center of the altar. The ground was shaking tremendously.
The prophet looked to the crowd, extending his Sith skull staff into the air. The metallic beads were jingling with verve as he made a statement to the followers. The robed prophet was ecstatic. Strife looked to Red Team with a smile.
Darth Strife: "Yes! He's right! The Ritual has begun!!! Awne has accepted its power! The promised time is here!"
Awne heard these words emanate from the Sith in a muffled cry, and in slow motion. Had she inadvertently accepted its power? The thought was quickly dismissed as she could feel the life of the followers. They were rabidly enjoying this moment and had waited long for their savior.

Awne's eyes widened in surprise, then horror; her heart sinking as she couln't get her hands off of it; all she could see turned white, the vibration running through her body making her wince and lower her ears to her hair.
Everything was muffled around her, had...he tricked her...he knew..he knew that this would have happened and he said nothing. She watches the crystal move, her eyes moving to her friends, her father, her pack; water filling them as she turns back to the crystal and the crowd.
She could feel them, she could feel them all..how happy they were but she....
*I didn't want this…*
her eyes were over flowing, a faint tear falling down her cheek
*I didn't want this…*

She growls and narrows her eyes to the Sith and the crystal "Gladly" she mutters in the direction of the woman, her hand moving to her saber, well hell it seemed it was all going to happen anyway, if that was the case then all of her moves were determined, and it didn't matter what she did.
She was advancing, her finger hitting the switch to activate her saber "I didn't want this! But if it's going to happen anyway then I'm going to do what I damn well please."

Kaz'jee couldnt help but feel a sense of pride as the Farghul answers Kayli. As the woman tried to help him get back up and out of harms way he calls to the Sith with obvious mirth "Hope you ready to die now! Just remember that you brought this on you...all of you!"

Kayli easily got the ewok back atop the stone summit. They looked behind them and noticed that the white aura around Awne was gradually growing. The ceremonial building was shaking lowly at the foundation. Everyone had slight trouble at keeping balance. Nevertheless, Awne kept her pace steady at the Sith Lord with the Kissaen crystal in tow.
The prophet spoke something to Darth Strife in Sith. He was shocked at the words and looked at Awne nervously.
The Sith was backing up to the other end of the stage, past the prophet. His hands were up, and he was pleading desperately.
Darth Strife: "No! Don't you realize...I just helped you fulfill your destiny! I bear no ill will to any of you! This was going to happen to you no matter what I've done. The Kissaen Crystal would have found you! Ple....No...duu.. don't kill me!"

"You helped Awne with what Awne didnt want...Dragged us all here to this place...tried to kill her...and You Expect not to be killed?" He looks up to Awne and says to her in a soft voice "Awne can kill him...then crystal thing...then be normal...yes? Kaz'jee...scared, but want Awne safe...Awne no look safe now..."

I didn't want this, I didn't want this rritual and I did not want to become something morre than what I was, but you have changed all of that!"
With no one stopping her, rather those standing behind her to help only increased her believe that this was right...or as right as could be, then again in her mindstate she didn't think she'd believe anyone at this moment. She paces to him, saber glowing as she shifts her hand stance and prepares to swipe at him.

On the other end of the summit, past the altar and opposite of Strife/Awne, Feldon stepped forward.
Feldon: "The prophet is warning Strife! He's quoting a verse...He's saying...uhh....only at the time of ascension can the Domitoris be killed. At this point the Domitoris sheds its mortal skin. The true Electus shall choose, but if the Electus is slain, the day of restoration will be a victim of time.."

Awne was unable to hear Feldon's statement. She reared back for a powerful one arm strike and brought her mid level swing in a wide arc. As her arm came around, she felt the Kissaen Crystal augmenting her strength unleashed with powerful swing. The violet blade struck at the torso of Strife, cutting him in two. The upper part of his body tumbled off his legs. His legs collapsed lifelessly to the side. Strife had been killed with one stroke, unwilling to defend himself against what he believed in.

Nuk had moved back towards the Prophet to protect him from the two that now stood behind him, the Ewok and the Human pilot. His hand on his Lanvorak, ready to destroy anyone who came within reach of his Prophet. His attention on them and the ones calling for the death of the Sith race.
The words of the human masqurading as a Sith made Nuk clench his ancient weapon in disgust. Weakness was not a trait found in true Sith. Nuk knew, even without his Prophet's guidance, that this imposter had to be destroyed. This Ascension ceremony could not be diluted by weak will and false dedication. The blood of the false Sith would probably help the ceremony along anyway.
Acting on initiative and a need to prove to the Electus that this false Sith is no longer part of his own race, Nuk moves to attack the whimpering fool, but is beaten by the Domitoris. He holds his attack and places himself between the Domitoris and his Prophet.

Kayli returned the ewok's hug, before walking over and reclaiming her blaster rifle. Before walking over to the remains of Strife and giving them a good kick, She then sighted down the barrel of her rifle on the Sith Prophet and Firing.
"Listen Awne, The Sith are an extinct race. Strife said so when we first showed up here. So for all we know, this is the event that caused that to happen. But don't let your anger take over your actions. You're a surgeon, and they are a cancer that needs to be cut away, coolly, calmly without emotion."

The prophet turned to see Kayli raising her weapon. He poised on his feet to react...
*Initiative Count:Prophet 30, Kayli 26: The battle dimensions are as follows; The stone ceremonial summit is 15 squares wide and 8 squares long on its top. There is a stone floor above you that provides overhead, they are supported by 6 pillars throughout the summit. There are a dozen torches lit about. There is an altar in the back center of the stage. You are all on the left side of the stage bunched together. Kaz is behind the altar…The prophet and Nuk are in the center. Awne and Kayli are on the other side completely away from Red Team. Kayli is standing next to Strife's remains, as is Awne. It's a 25 meter drop off of the building. There is a 30 meter smooth stone stairwell to the summit a few meters ahead of the altar. If you want to participate in the fight between Kayli and the Prophet you'll need to succeed on a perception.*

The prophet slammed his staff down at the raising rifle and shot forth his hand. The Force slammed Kayli and she was propelled off the side of the summit. It was a brisk fall into the rocky darkness and she hit the ground with a smack. Kayli felt tremendous pain in her right leg, and she assumed it was probably broken. She looked up through the darkness and couldn't see her friends above her on the summit. If she wanted to get back to them she would have to go around to the stairs approach.
*It is now Kayli's turn. If anyone else wishes to attack, state this. You have suffered 30 damage, and are -1 on the condition track. You can only move half your speed and take -5 to anything that involves your right leg.*

Stupid person...If Kaz'jee could he would kill you right now...here people in trouble while you supposed to be leading but yet you do -nothing-! Do something now to redeem yourself or Kaz'jee tell your superiors that you useless!" He then sprints off to go towards Kayli, a med-pac in tow.

Better that than think of the what if's.

The farghul and the Lieutenant keep up their heated debate about philosophical meanings when a bolt of white energy shoots down from the dark sky. The right side of the summit is struck hard and rocks descend down into the darkness roughly where Kayli had fallen.
Kaz 'Jee was helping her to her feet when a huge rock slammed on top of her. The ewok felt the boulder scrape his leg in pain. *He takes 10 damage.* He got back up and looked for Kayli, but she was crushed completely under the rock.
A top the summit, the winds began to pick up as part of the stone roof began collapsing. The torches were being blown out but the white energy kept the summit illuminated. Lues looked around desperately.
Lues Van: "Everyone silence! There is only one way I know to stop the Ritual. This isn't the way to bring balance to the Force, and I believe it in my heart. The Force does not bring destruction in its name!"
He stepped forward from the group who was assembled in slight confusion. The Jedi Knight unclipped his lightsaber from his belt.
Lues Van: "Now Awne . . . This is for the Force, and everything we ever stood for. For goodness... and knowing one's path. Become one with the Force...or I'll shall do it for you."
The Jedi ignited his blue lightsaber and turned to Red Team, defiant even as he stood in front of Awne. His white hair was blowing in his face quite annoyingly as he stood. The prophet saw this and hastily brought up his staff, waiting for Nuk to assume a stance.

Awne had been in awe that beautiful gold color, really for that color she might actually forgo her old one; gold was such a pretty color. The sudden voice behind her though broke her thoughts, turning to her..ah...a master Jedi...not like he was her anything really.
The farghul frowns at him "This is what you choose?" she points to him with her free hand "you choose to trry and kill me to prrolong the rritual instead of let it go on?" She sighs faintly "It's parrtly yourr fault we'rre in this mess to begin with!" She was amazed, could the day get much worse? She sighs and looks to the pretty new saber.
Destruction and Peace was what was said to her coming, she had unknowingly accepted the ritual by simply touching the crystal in the hopes of going home; now...the one that was half of the reason was doing his best to convince the others of her friends, her family that it was better to kill her.
Two people had died now by rocks that were caused by her emotions...she could only imagine what would happen during a battle. She looks to the cold saber, bringing it to her to look at the jewels; she got to see her father again, she got to see mur and her master. She had wanted quite badly to see Master Skywalker, and to be able to take Kaz home at least, but she knew Vor'en would take care of him if things turned out badly.
So what was she to do? If she let them try, they could get hurt worse, if she didn't and did it herself, she might never see them again. She was stuck...

He places a hand on the huge rock for a moment as a show of reverence and respect before making his way carefully back up to where the others were. He could hear people talking, Awne and the jedi master specifically, but wasnt sure what was going on. Either way, it sounded like something bad was being brought about. "Kaz'jee coming Awne!!"

After a few moments, Kaz 'Jee had climbed the long stair well. There he saw a confrontation in the energy resonating summit. The winds were picking up significantly, obviously because of Awne's Ritual. Some members of the team were now squaring off with the farghul. The ewok watched as Jes walked deliberately to Awne's side. She quickly drew her blue sword and stood ready in front of the farghul.
Jes Mur Eva: "I've sworn to be the Domitoris's guardian...You must go through me Lues...don't make me do this."
Feldon cursed himself and pleaded.
Feldon: "No!!! It doesn't have to be this way!!! You're in no condition to fight!"
Mur Eva: "Silence Fel...this is not about us. This is about our commitment...to our beliefs. All of you are witnessing a prophecy coming to fruit. She is the chosen one...as seen. To go against this is blasphemy and denial. I shall protect her during Ascension. After all Fel, you never were the one to assert yourself for what you believed."
Feldon looked to the ground, covering his face with arm. His saddened and humiliated state was glaringly obvious to everyone as you heard a quick sniffle.
Mur Eva motioned to the prophet and the bodyguard, Nuk. They all stood facing Red Team, weapons raised. The 30,000 Sith were chanting their foreboding mantra, underlining the tense situation.

Lues: "Fix her huh? How many lives must disappear until that time? She's too unstable and has to be stopped now. If we wait we could lose more lives than we save...You also forget that I lead the mission now. You can't officially order me."
Indeed, the area around Red Team was being threatened by energy outbursts and growing wind speed. A terrible storm was brewing, and you were about to be in the brunt of it.

Natirash calmly puts his hands in his pockets, automatically feeling the thermal detonator in there, he feels for the time settings, he couldn't think of which was worse, waiting to die, or hearing everyone argue while they waited to die, either way he was fraked, if Awne was killed the sith would probably kill them all as they would have no use for them, if Awne survived then she would probably eventually kill them all anyway, but the key thing was that if Awne survived he would live another day. Natirash couldn't really figure out what to believe, though the utter destruction that was around them gave him an idea of what was to come.

"You are not in charge here Lues. The Lt. is and I am telling you to stand down or so help me I will fire." Vor'en was trying to bring some order to what was happening but it was not working out the way he wanted it to. Lues had always been a pain in the backside but he was still his friend and he didn't want to kill him if he didn't have to. "Awne! Calm yourself this getting us no where! We can sort this if everyone will just calm down."

Through it all the farghul had been silent listening as she looked to her new saber. No one understood, she hardly did herself but was it the only way?
**"Awne! Calm yourself this getting us no where! We can sort this if everyone will just calm down."** 
She looks up at that point "I am calm...I..don't think I've everr been calmerr.." She looks to those around her, defending her either for friendship or for what they believed in. Looking downwards to those still below she focuses on her master; what condition would be harmful to Mur? she was sith tainted yes but that hardly limited her...and he...he did not care either way then? Or did he not know what to believe in.
Her gaze passes over the lt. seemed he was the same, or perhaps just didn't want to be involved. Blue eyes return to the Jedi threatening her life, her free hand moving to the old soldiers shoulder in front of her "Vorr...don't...please?" she looks to the side "Kaz, Murr...no fighting...the one thing I had asked for beforre I even thought to take on that crrystal was that no one of us would be hurrt..and now look..." She moves aside from them and around the alter, so they wouldn't be in the wake of the storm any longer.
"This is all my fault..." she mumbles.
"I don't want to die...hardly finished living as it is...but you..you shouldn't be fighting eachotherr. We'rre all frriends, we'rre family, one pack no matterr the differrences and the time it takes to get overr them."
She looks again to the saber in her hand "it'd be better to do it myself anyway.." she mumbles softly

As Awne contemplates her next action and the stand-off continues, a powerful sphere of white light darts from the farghul's aura. It strikes Vor'en hard as he is flung to the right. The grizzled soldier slams into a stone pillar like a loose doll. He then flops to the ground awkwardly, and is laying on his stomach in considerable pain. Due to the impact, his insides felt horribly jarred and the sting from the blast still nipped at his consciousness in an awesome wave. As he was gathering his senses, he saw Lues dashing toward Awne in an obvious offensive.
*Vor'en takes 67 dmg and moves -1 on the condition track. Initiative Count:Vor'en 38, Prophet 37, Lues 34, Feldon 30, Jes Mur Eva 23, Nuk 19, Natirash 16, Kaz 13, Awne 12.

As Vor'en is slammed into the stone pillar he thinks to himself.*"She attacked me."* He couldn't belive what had happened. He picks hmself up to a knee his weapon still in his hand. Trying to fight back thee blackness that was clawing at his conciseness. *" Got to stop this. Can't let it end this way."* The thoughts running throw his mind. He looks up to see Lues running for Awne weapon ready to strike. "No! Lues stop!" He rasies his weapon his eye still not completely focused. He aims as best he could, and pulls the trigger.

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-02-21 23:43:15)

Vor'en raises his weapon off the ground and squeezes a controlled burst at the charging Jedi. The blue lightsaber is deftly swung around and easily swats the bolts with the hums of his energy sword. Lues was indeed difficult to hit due to his Jedi education.
The prophet saw this and turned to the defending fighter, he extended his hand while pushing over the Jedi. Apparently Lues was distracted just enough for the Prophet to use a Force Attack. He slid a few meters past his friendly lines and sprung to his feet. He charged at Awne, aiming at her head with his weapon. The blue blade grazed her face with a burning sensation seeping through her fur. *Awne takes 22 dmg. Bringing her down to 55 hp.*
Feldon saw this and reluctantly drew his lightsaber to help Lues. He swiftly followed in his steps by advancing toward the Farghul. Mur Eva, who was next to Awne, ignited her lightsaber and swiped at the Jedi Knight who coming to aid Lues. The strong blow was deflected by Feldon but he was knocked back considerably.
The Kissaen crystal was reacting strangely to the mantra from the crowd and the fight. It had now begun hovering over the altar, all the while keeping its energy link with Awne. It was now also raining with great force on top of the ceremonial summit, but the stone roof had kept you dry.
*It is now Nuk's turn.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-02-23 02:50:23)

Nuk stood amongst the friendly lines as the storm continued to grow. Energy was pulsating in every direction and the rain was now whipping hard to the side from the wind. He watched the Prophet and Awne closely, ready to strike if anyone came near them.

Natirash feels over the thermal detonator, but decides against it, grabbing a smoke grenade he decides to provide a little distraction, he pulls the pin out and hurls it towards Nuk and the prophet attempting to shield them and the other sith from view of the fight. He then attempts to find cover.

Natirash saw a pillar close to the edge of summit while drawing his smoke grenade. The rain was beating on his face but getting cover behind the pillar would provide some relief from it as well as the incoming fire. He then quickly turned back to the opposition lines who were not far from them and tossed the smoke. The small canister popped and began fizzling with smoke in front of Ludin and Nuk.

Kaz rushed through the billowing smoke and whipping winds to his fallen friend. The rain was quickly accumulating on the stone ground as he moved about. He skidded to a halt next to Vor'en, who was sitting up on all fours. The red energy from his weapon was illuminating the area nearby. With all the commotion going on, Kaz began sifting through his med pac.

Awne flinches as she watches her friend fly back at the cause of the energy, the burn from the saber at her face made her physically flinch back and watch horrified as not only was he thrown back, but her master move forward to attack her. She couldn't see her father anymore, she hoped though that he was somewhere safe, he was a hand-to-hand fighter, a saber match so no place for him and more and more she was regretting him being there.
Looking at this scene it pauses in her mind, slow motion of all that was happening, looking to her fallen friend of an old soldier, the ewok moving to his side, near them Lues finding his feet, Mur and her master locked in combat. She never wanted any of this..she didn't want anyone to get hurt. This was her fault, and now the choice was be killed, or kill herself.
Her eyes move upwards, the crystal in her sights; were those the only options?
Her eyes narrow, no..no they weren't. To hell with this.
Time sped up around her but she didn't care anymore, gripping the saber in her hand she moves forward to swing at the crystal with the gold colored light. She was no one's pawn, and she wasn't about to die for something she wasn't even sure she believed in.
No one was going to have to go through this, ever again.

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-02-25 20:27:32)

Awne turned her back to Lues and felt the hum of his blade whisk past her. The weapon barely missed as she darted to the altar. Once there she brandished her gold lightsaber for an overhead swipe. Once she struck the crystal, something odd happened. The summit foundation began shaking violently and a slight crack could be seen at the feet of Kaz 'Jee. Interfering with the crystal was causing the ground to shake. The area around the ceremonial summit had become increasingly chaotic and unstable. Perhaps Awne's interaction in the Ritual had caused this great storm?
*It is now Vor'en's turn.*

## Re: Final Chapter (Korriban)

### **ganthet** (2010-02-26 13:01:37)

With all the craziness happening still around him he barely noticed the Ewok work on his wounds. *"This has to stop. Sorry my friend."* He decides his course of action. Awne was the key to the all of this and as much as it pained him to do it if it meant her death to save them, then that is what had to happen. He sees Awne turn and almost be ended by Lues attack. He sees her lightsaber come down on something and the earth moves. He steadies himself and goes into action. "Lues worry about the profit guy, Feldon keep your sister busy! I will handle the rest." Her back was to him it was the prefect time to end this. He switches his weapon to single fire and aims at Awne. He keeps telling himself that this maybe the only way. Carefully lines up the shot and pulls the trigger in double tap fashion.

Vor'en raised his blaster rifle sights to rest on Awne's back. He pulled the trigger and one of the bolts grazed her side, creating a gashing wound that bled through from her fur. And as she yelped in pain, the crack in the summit grew in its length. The divide began much more open as the summit shifted. Feldon and Mur Eva were unable to gain their footing as they toppled into the cracked stone. They were effectively out of sight as you saw their lightsabers battling in the darkness.
As the structure began unevenly aligning through the ground shaking, the prophet pointed ahead with his skulled staff. Streams of lighting emanated from the weapon, striking Vo'ren and sending electric currents through him. Lues saw this attack and side stepped to the left. He leaped over the wide crack in the structure that had effectively divided both lines of attackers. The Jedi was approaching Awne quickly.
Lues Van: "Surrender yourself to the Force!!!"

Nuk observed that the Prophet had become aggressive towards Vor'en. The soldier was targeting their esteemed Domitoris. The Sith reared back with his double-disc pole arm and unleashed with a powerful swing. The sheer speed of the swipe let loose a disc from the end of the staff and it whisked towards Vor'en. Vor'en quickly dropped to his belly as he heard the nasty zip of the disc blade over his head.
*It is now Natirash's turn.*

Natirash quickly pulls out a grenade and lobs it towards Awne, if she was going to be killed it would be by his hand, as far as he was concerned it was her fault that two of the team members had died, and he wanted to get this over with.

Natirash removed a fragmentation grenade from his utility pouch and pulled the pin. Under the veil of the billowing smoke he tossed the explosive near the altar.
Awne heard a small thunk next to her and turned to see the grenade. She dived to the other side of the stone altar but the explosion still engulfed her. Fragmentation littered her body as she looked up to the others. She felt her life force fading fast as her eyes shut. Through the smoke and whipping storm she caught one fateful look to her father...

Kaz Jee, who was next to Vor'en in the ripping storm, dropped his med pac and aimed a blaster at his side. The grizzled soldier saw this attack coming and moved a quick swipe at his wrist. The ewok's shot was deflected into the air by Vor'en's quick reactions.
The party was now in a vicious close-quarters battle atop the stormy dais. Rain, wind, lightning, and smoke made it difficult to see, but everyone persisted to defeat or defend Awne. Their beliefs were on the line and death was just around the corner for anyone who made an unsound move.

Who knew being shot could make one feel so light. Everything was silent, dark, was she floating? or was she falling? Then again...were they one in the same? Her friend had shot her...in the back no less, she had defended him countless times, watched his back...he was part of the pack, her family and he shot her...shot her while she was trying to destroy the crystal and end it all..
*Some friend…*
Her master was trying to kill her too..

Lues as well...still trying to end her life without even a breath of sorrow...After all they had been through..

Woro wouldn't have done this...Lohras wouldn't have either...maybe it was better that they were gone, they couldn't see what these....these people were really about.
*Narrow minded fools…*
Her eyes open slowly, so that was why it was so dark...she could hardly move, it hurt so much...who knew it would hurt so much..
*Father…*
She could see him, she was glad he hadn't joined, she didn't want him to fight. Eyes close again slowly, opening just as slowly to find him gone.
*Father…?*
Cloth, she saw it from the corner of her eye, her head turns, oh how it hurt to move! But there...feet..no..boots, pants...She looks up as best she could, she knew that stance; that was the stance of a well trained master of the art of hand-to-hand.
So he was joining the fight...defending her against a saber...foolish..but...she appreciated it. He was the fastest person she knew...maybe he was faster then a Jedi..
"Fatherr..." she mumbles softly, her hand straining to reach for his leg, ankle, pant leg, anything, he needed to get out of that fray.

Awne's father looked toward her and shook his head in disbelief, he charged over towards her despite the ongoing battle and storm. He took a quick look to her and turned his head toward the other fighters. The human male raised his right fist while his arms steadied in a combat stance to defend his fallen daughter. He slammed his foot down on the stone and posed.

After the lighting attack from one of the Sith. His body twitched from the attack every muscle hurt, but he had to get his team out of this in one piece. Looking up at the Sith above them. "She is down. Stop this maddness now and let us leave before anyone else is killed!" Yelling at them with all of his strength. "Don't make me have to kill her! Please I can do it! Send us back now!!!" Vor'en was physically and mentally drained, he was injured and his will to go fighting was failing him.

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-03-12 22:35:00)

The storm was now in full swing as the rain was stinging everyone's face. The stone dais was on the verge of total collapse at any second. Most likely, everyone would be killed or seriously injured due to the Kissaen's instability. Nevertheless, the Domitoris's guardians defended the prophesized one.
The sith raised his staff yet again at Vor'en who had attacked Awne. A large rock was levitated at him and struck his face/shoulders with vicious speed. He winced as he felt like a ton of bricks had been dropped against his fragile bones. *Vor'en takes 16 damage.*
Just as he regained his bearings, he saw Lues hopping across the dais platform to another side. He then ran over to Awne and readied his lightsaber to finish her off. Nuk then launched a disc at him and he grimaced as it grazed his side. He renewed his determination and shouted...
Lues: "Sorry my friend, this has to be done!"

The rock slams into him. His face and shoulder scream in pain. Every nerve was alive and telling him to he had better find cover and fast. He sees Lues jump from the stone they where on to striking distance of Awne. He was going to end her and there nothing he could do about it. He himself was almost finished in this fight. *"Got to find away to stop this. Got to get everyone out alive. Nothing else matters."* He thinks to himself.

## Re: Final Chapter (Korriban)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-03-15 01:33:03)

Kaz looked left and right at the ensuing chaos. A large stone from the dais rooftop fell at the edge of the rock stage. Kaz held onto his part of the crumbling stage as the last thing he saw was Vor'en firing into the fray. The next thing the ewok saw was blackness. An empty and soulless black.
Back on the dais, Lues quickly dismissed the cut at his side from Nuk's attack. He said a quick prayer for Awne as he sized her up for an attack....
The farghul was oblivious to everything going on around her as the Kissaen crystal continued its swirling chaos.
Apparently, Feldon and Mur Eva were still battling in the crack of the dais, isolated from the rest of the combatants.
So it came down to this...friendship eternal brought to a confrontation of destiny. One person shouldered with infinite responsibility battles against her friends who would do her harm. They seek answers and the ability to stop further death of their friends. Whose resolve will count the most?

Vor'en looks to the spot where Lues had leaped. He was getting ready to strike at Awne and bring this to the end he thought needed to happen. Life without his dear friend would move on but some how there would be a great emptiness to it. He may survive this and find something else to fill his life with, but that did seem the same without her in it. *"This is crazy. I have to stop this get us out of here alive."* he thinks to himself. With that he raises his weapon and aims for Lues. His back to him he may never stop it. Carefully lining up the shot he sends to blots screaming at him.

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-03-16 18:35:10)

Vor'en fires a clean burst at the Jedi Knight raising his sword at Awne. The attack blindsides him and knocks him off balance when he gets struck in the arm. The Prophet sees the wounded Jedi and follows up on the attack, desperately trying to get some space between Awne and the attacker. Using the Force, the Jedi Knight is pushed to the edge of the dais and nearly loses his balance. He wobbles his arms wildly and keeps his footing. He lets out a cry as he hops toward Awne's body.
Suddenly, Mur Eva had clambered up the rocky divide in the dais structure. She had climbed out of the large crack that had swallowed Feldon and her whole. Apparently, she had sensed Awne was in trouble. The female Jedi Knight executed a Force assisted somersault to strike down Lues before it was too late.
Almost at the peak of her jump, Feldon intercepted her and they exchanged a quick flurry of lightsaber strikes. And as they landed, Feldon's blade was accidentally deflected into Mur Eva's stomach.
Mur Eva: "Unghh!!"
Lues looked in her direction as she toppled to the floor from a mortal strike. He shook the distraction off and plunged his lightsaber into Awne's chest with resolve, killing her.
In response to Awne's death, the Kissaen Crystal began shaking violently. The barely intact dais began shaking and crumbling at its foundation. Lightning bolts were striking in every direction and everyone had to fight to stay balanced.
Ludin Kreth looked to the crowd of 30,000 who were being tossed about in an earthquake. The ground was swallowing them up in a chaotic brew of rock and tectonic divides. He pleaded that they still pray for the Ritual. He also ordered his bodyguard to kneel in prayer with him at their final moment of desperation. The prophet dropped his staff, kissing the ground in complete devotion.
The death of Awne had triggered an event of epic proportions, as Red Team had stood in the face of destiny and challenged it. A gigantic storm was now in full swing with winds now creating a swirling ballad of doom. And the eye of the storm was Awne with the Kissaen Crystal in tow. Some had believed that the death of Awne would bring peace and a delay of her taking up her destiny of destruction, but the Kissaen crystal was resonating with built up chaos.
Feldon shouted in the howling winds and subduing rain.
Feldon: "Jes is down!!! Someone help me!!! Who else is alive?!?!"
The blonde Jedi knight, covered in blood and soaking wet....cupped Mur Eva's head.
Feldon: "I'm so sorry....it came to this..."

Now with Awne and Strife dead, no one else seemed to want to fight due to the ferocious storm. Everyone was doing their best to survive and figure out what was going on. Feldon watched as the members of Red Team gathered around them.
Mur Eva: "Awne has been kil *cough* *gurgle*.....she was the chosen one...and you've only delayed the inevitable..."
Jes placed her hand on Feldon's cheek.
Jes Mur Eva: "After all these years, you've gotten the resolve to fight for what you believe. I a.....so happy..."
Feldon: "Stay with me....just for a few moments!!!!"
Lues ran to Feldon's side, deactivating his lightsaber.
Lues Van: "We've got to go!!!"
Feldon shouted back in tears....
Feldon: "LEAVE ME!!!! The Force has betrayed me!!! I've lost my love!!! We had to raise arms against our comrades!!! I choose death!!! I don't care if the Dark Side itself claims me as it's own!! I seek merciful evil!!! At least it is pure!!!"
Mur Eva was fighting for her last few seconds....
Mur Eva: "Quiet....*hack* you've got to save my child......our child....he still lives... Let him look at the world in its true light."
Feldon gasped in shock and nodded his head in compliance. He placed his hands on her stomach, concentrating with the Force.
Feldon: "Someone help me!!! Somebody help me right now!!!!"
Mur Eva began screaming in agony, and it was just barely audible over the tremendous chaos.
Mur Eva: "Hurry Feldon.....*whimper*"

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-03-16 18:53:47)

Vor'en and Natirash kneeled over at Mur Eva's side, helping to deliver the baby in desperation. Feldon was using the Force to stabilize Mur Eva and the baby. Lues had also decided to help.
Mur Eva screamed and gagged on some blood. Finally, her mortality caught up with her and she shut her eyes.
Feldon looked down to her and cried...
Feldon: "No!!! My love!!! Stay with me!!! See our child!!!"
Lues screamed over the rain.
Lues Van: "She's gone!!! Help me before it's too late!!!"
Both Jedi focused and continued to deliver the baby, using every ounce of their Force ability. Vor'en shouted....
Vor'en: "We've got it!!! Feldon don't lose sight!!!"
And if to salvage the desperation with a glimmer of hope, you all heard a baby crying mercifully.
Tears were enveloping Feldon's eyes as he saw the premature newborn full of life... It was seemingly healthy, but the lightsaber strike had removed the baby of its arm.

Feldon: "Hi Noa...."
He looked down to his deceased lover....
Feldon: "He made it....my love...Noa lives...I'm so sorry..."
At the end of his sentence, he fell into a complete breakdown.
The Kissaen Crystal was now swirling with white energy and a pulsating sphere that was expanding toward the group.
Lues: "Come on everyone!!! Feldon, take Noa and let's go!!! This place is about to go up!!! Somebody go get Kaz 'Jee!!!"
Vor'en nodded and descended down the crumbling stones of the dais to search for his friend.
Lues saw that Feldon wasn't responding and he grabbed his shoulder.
Lues: "Let's G..."
Feldon brought his lightsaber around in a flash and slashed at Lues, his red-yellow eyes covered in tears. The Jedi easily just barely dodged the attack.
Feldon: "LEAVE ME!!!! LET ME DIE WITH HER!!!"
The resolve in his statement silenced Lues, he reluctantly signaled to Natirash and they began running towards the stairs to get away from the pending explosion. As they were doing some distance they noticed the crowd of Sith charging towards them in anger.
Lues: "Go the other way!!! I'll buy some time!!!"
Lues handed the baby Noa to Natirash as he turned his head and shot toward the opposite side of the dais, running across the rocky ground.
After a few seconds of sprinting, he was on the other side of the crumbling monument. He shouted for Vor'en...but no response.
The white energy sphere was now nearly encasing the whole structure and Lues was on the other side of it, likely being massacred by the angry Sith zealots. It appeared Natirash might be the only survivor, along with the premature infant.
When suddenly, he saw Vor'en clawing his way out of some rocks, along with a wounded Kaz 'Jee. They nodded and began running desperately in the opposite direction of the dais. They looked to the mountains horizon of Korriban, barely able to see everything in this nightmare.
They ran for every second their energy would give them...legs were pumping and they were panting.... They were practically breathing in rain drops. Noa was crying unbelievably and all hope seemed lost. Kaz Jee collapsed from exhaustion but Vor'en picked him back up to his feet.
