# [Heart Of Shadows] Chapter 3 Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 18:32:29)

Awne awakes with a punch to the face. She is sitting in a plasteel chair with her arms bound behind her. She has power couplings wrapped around her chest and stomach, with the ends of the cables digging into her side. It becomes quickly apparent that she has been captured by the Rodian, Deeluk. He is standing next to computer in front of her, and the room appears to be very small. She can only see one door to her far left.
Deeluk: "Hehe, did you sleep well? I sent one of your friends on an errand, and you better to tell me what I want to know...or this could be very painful. I also hope, that your friend holds up to his half of the bargain."

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 18:44:16)

Awne groans softly, shaking her head only to groan again as the room spun. She looks up at the Rodian and growls softly "wherre the hell am I.."

Deeluk: "Don't you remember me? I employed you...you are still in Mos Esre."

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 18:55:06)

Awne blinks slowly and frowns "yes I rrememberr you. what of it." She tries to move her wrist and tail, testing to see what she was able to get loose

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 18:58:30)

Deeluk paces around.
Deeluk: "You are going to answer some questions for me, any lies could bare serious repercussions. I want to help you out of here but you'll need to honest."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 19:03:43)

Awne fidgets in the chair, trying to move a little "any chance you can loosen these? it's cutting into my furr." She smirks giving a soft chuckle, better to try and joke to keep the mind off what pain may come, also helped to keep the heart rate down to make it harder for sensors to detect a lieing heartbeat.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:08:47)

Deeluk: "We'll see if you answer questions truthfully. Now, who are you working for? Why did you default and get rid of the slaves?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 19:09:59)

Awne just sighs and looks at him dryly "I don't worrk forr anyone, I frreelance. And I had a betterr offerr; you underrstand."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:11:26)

Deeluk: "Well did you know that you have an imperial spy among you? Maybe more?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 19:13:30)

Awne rolls her shoulder in a shrug "I go afterr bounties on both sides of everrything, whoeverr pays morre, I've worrked alongside all types at one time orr anotherr." she pauses and grins "if therre's a spy then chances arre I don't know who it is, a spys only as good as his coverr..if I knew who it was, they wouldn't be verry good now would they?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:14:48)

Deeluk: "Who did you give the slaves to? Was it the Bleeding Wampas?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 19:22:12)

Awne blinks "Don't quiet rrememberr the name but bleeding something orr otherr sounds about rright." She breathes normaly, using her training to help keep her calm.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:24:09)

Deeluk chuckles.
Deeluk: "One of you are lying, and that means you are going to pay the price."
Awne feels a tremendous jolt of electricity tear through her body, the energy jerks her muscles while she feels unbearable pain. *Make an Endurance check Awne.*

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:28:47)

Awne feels her strength sapping fast as the Rodian mercifully releases the energy.
Deeluk: "So, who's lying in your group...you ...or the older human male?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 19:30:49)

Awne groans in relief when it stopped "you know..that hurrts like you wouldn't believe." She tries to sit up in her chair more, but her muscles scream at her, to which she abandons the idea and sighs "I don't know what the otherr perrson told you..so how would I know who's lieing?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:50:02)

Deeluk: "Who'd you deliver the slaves to? No funny talk here! This will inevitably kill you, and your friends will suffer next if you die! I don't need you to talk...I have others!"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 19:53:29)

Awne sighs and looks at him again "I told you, bleeding something. I just do what I'm told, someone gave the team a betterr offerr forr the kits..ah..kids. So we drroped them of with them, end of everrything, just anotherr job that I've alrready put to the back of my mind."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:55:19)

Deeluk: "Someone's lying, and someone has to pay!"
Awne feels the electricity surge through her body again, the pain more worse than what she remembers. *Make an endurance check.*

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 19:57:33)

The energy stops flowing through Awne as she finds it harder to breathe, her body growing more weary by the second.
Deeluk: "I know this hurts. The older one said that you delivered them to the New Republic. Who is lying?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 20:05:50)

Awne's head was swimming, she was having trouble focusing on the Rodian but she looked in the general direction of the voice "the new what now? mind saying...that again?" she winces, trying to find a way to breathe. "that last..ugh...shock seems to have done a numberr on...ow..my earrs." She needed to buy time, think of something and pray her luck and training wouldn't fail her with cry for help to that Jedi master.

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:07:47)

*On the way.*
Awne hears that in her head, it seem stranged...as if someone was whispering directly into her mind.
Deeluk looks aggravated.
Deeluk: "Don't play dumb with me! Answer the question!"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 20:17:35)

Awne takes a mild comfort from the words though she doesn't show it with another quick plea of 'hurrrry'
She sighs, chuckling softly "Alrright..you got me." she winces again "some lady wanted a few kids as maids orr something didn't ask what she wanted 'em forr just that she wanted 'em. She said she'd meet us at the New Rrepublic, nice arrea that most otherrs won't botherr us on. We gave herr one of the weak one and a strrong one, couldn't give herr all the good ones the bleeding whateverrs would get upset and dock us in pay. So we gave 'em to herr and the otherrs to the bleeding peoples. Got paid on two ends and I call that I betterr deal."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:19:44)

Deeluk: "So we can still retrieve the slaves from the Bleeding Wampas? Why didn't your friend tell us this? He said he'd just get us the money because he didn't know where they went."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 20:23:17)

Awne rolls a shoulder again "We don't know what they did with 'em, just changed hands, they could've sold 'em to someone else forr all we know. Orr just killed 'em, I dunno. Prrobably felt it'd be easierr and less trrouble to pay you then just trry and trrack down some punk kids who may not even be alive." She winces and tries to move again, groaning when her muscles complain. "damn binds..glad forr them as they seem to be holding me up but damn they cut into furr." she winces again.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:30:08)

*Awne gains 100 experience.*
Deeluk looks like he is deep in thought.
Deeluk: "Can you or your friends make the payment of 70,000?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 20:35:13)

Awne's head snaps up, even though her eyes cloud over from how much her eyes swim "oh hell, that wasn't a smarrt move.." she mutters to herself "70,000 what?? shit I don't even know a bounty that high! do have a deadline orr something?" she groans again "I'm not a rrich woman..how arre we suppossed to come up with that kind of money?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:37:43)

Deeluk: "Well your friend said that he could get it. Is there a lie now? Can he get the money? We need to know. "

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 20:41:07)

Awne gives him a dry look "you'rre asking me to rread someones mind. I don't know what plan he has but if he said he can get you money than he can get you money. I'm surre I can find a bounty forr a nice amount..taverrns arre the best places forr those rright? orr does this worrld do something differrent?"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:42:40)

Deeluk: "Well if he can't get the money within twenty-seven hours then one of you will die."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 20:44:37)

Awne: "you'rre gonna kill me? why? wouldn't it just be betterr to have two bounty hunterrs hunting? Morre bountys morre money."
*Persuasion +2 go!*

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:46:03)

A Trandoshan in a grey combat jumpsuit walks in. He speaks in Dosh towards Deeluk.
Deeluk: "Yea, if he asks for any outside help then we'll kill her, and use the other two for information."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:50:15)

Deeluk seems angry at Awne.
Deeluk: "We'll let you go if we get our money, but until then, you are bait. We can dispose of you easily."
A shoddy dressed human male pushes Dexer into the room.
Human: "The guy you let go isn't cooperating. You sure that was a smart move?"
Deeluk: "Yes, he'll get the money or they will all die...we have some possible locations of the slaves anyhow."
The human knees Dexer in the stomach as he collapses to the floor. He seems to be in horrible shape, his face is almost unrecognizable.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 20:56:14)

Awne sighs and grins slightly "can't blame a girrl forr trrying. That offerr to call him still up? I'd like to tell him the time limit." She keeps a smile on her face, though it's pained from all the shocks, in her mind she curses the old soldier and prays he can get to them. She sends another message to the jedi, she was starting to get the hang of this..
*UtF +7 message: 70k, 27 hrs*
Awne gasps as her eyes rest on the form "dex??" she looks at them "let go? what do you mean let go??"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 20:58:23)

*Ok, on the way.*
The human kicks Dexer into the corner and he slumps over, he badly needed medical attention.
Deeluk: "You'll stay here and keep your mouth shut. If your friend makes any bad moves then one of you dies."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 21:02:41)

Awne tries to squirm, gasping at the pain "could you atleast let me check on that human? just..tell me he's still brreathing? maybe loosen these strraps? please?" She takes a breath and bats her eyes, giving the Rodian and sweet smile; being a girl had to do something..
*+2 persuasion*

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 21:22:32)

Deeluk waves his hand over the computer console.
Deeluk: "You will speak only when spoken to."
Dexer seems unconscious from the pain.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 21:23:47)

Awne sighs, and tries to get comfortable in the chair, her tail flicks and she holds onto the hope that the jedi will find her quickly.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 22:47:11)

The human and the Trandoshan leave the room. Deeluk continues to watch Awne very closely.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 22:51:08)

Awne just stares back, not saying a word, her tail flicking lightly.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-18 22:54:19)

He puts his back to Awne, and she notices Dexer shift his weight uncomfortably in the corner.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-18 22:56:27)

Awne's eyes shift to the body on the floor, she opens her mouth to speak but stops herself; just settling for rapid tail movements.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-19 21:35:18)

Deeluk calls one of his friends on the comlink, and after a few minutes...a middle-aged male dressed in a blast vest and helmet walks in. He begins to watch over the unconscious Dexer and Awne. He seems to be armed with a KX-60 and a blaster pistol holstered on his thigh.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-19 22:03:06)

Awne blinks at the human, watching his movements; her tail flicks idly,

### **zerah** (2008-03-21 00:32:30)

Awne makes no outward appearance of the message, though inwardly she was thanking every deity she could think of. How were they going to get in? there was one guard in the room and they wouldn't have just left one..She focuses and sends a message back *"carreful"*

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-21 00:44:04)

Awne sighs softly, shifting in the chair to get comfortable; well as comfortable as she could, all things concidered.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-22 18:20:04)

The armed human walks over and kicks Dexer. Dexer let's out a cough.
Human: "Hmph, good your still alive."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-22 20:05:50)

Awne glares at the human kicking the other human, restraining a growl as much as possible though her tail flicks in anger.

Human blaster-toting male: "You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for ya! Whatever you are..."

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-22 20:52:07)

Awne glares but does as she was told, she needed to survive so the others could find her and Rith..where was he..was he ok? She sighs and looks away to the side wondering where he was, her tail curls and uncurls slowly by her feet.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-26 19:27:20)

Deeluk runs into the room, the guard perks up as he appears.
Deeluk: "We've got a situation in the storeroom, if I tell you, take this creature elsewhere and we will meet at another time."
Deeluk leaves with his blaster rifle at the ready.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-31 01:11:17)

You both hear blasterfire beyond the closed door. The human man tenses up, and raises his blaster rifle at the door nervously.
Human: "I'll use you as insurance if I have to!"
Dexer seems to wake up, and he looks at Awne with doubt in his eyes.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-31 01:40:28)

With the blaster weilding human looking to the door Awne looks to Dexer mouthing 'can you move?'

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-31 01:49:38)

Dexer nods, and she gets the feeling he wonders what is going on.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-31 02:49:55)

Awne mouths again "can you disarm him" being careful on the R to make it more pronouced and not purr it like usual.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-31 02:59:16)

Dexer turns a little bit to show Awne his bound hands behind his back, they were durable binders.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-03-31 03:02:18)

Awne drops her head in the show of a sigh then lifts back up to smile lightly at the human, her eyes apologetic that she was bound too.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-06 06:23:29)

Awne watches the human on his comlink. He then walks over to Awne and holds the comlink to her mouth.
Human: "Speak, Deeluk needs to hear that you are unharmed."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-04-06 14:43:37)

Awne glares at the human, then at the comlink, then back again. She finally rolls her eyes and sighs, clearing her throat she speaks dryly "I hate you, the metal is chafing my furr, the human is horrrrible company, and I'm starrting to dispise this planet; otherr then that I'm fine thanks."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-09 19:10:36)

The human's comlink chirps, he picks it up and answers it.
Snivvian: "Get our prisoners out! Kill one of them if I don't check in after five minutes!"
The human kicks Dexer and points his rifle at him.
Human: "Get up! You're coming with me, and no sudden movements are you're bantha poodoo!"

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-09 22:47:50)

The human moves over to Awne after hitting a switch on the wall-computer. He begins unraveling the power cables around her.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-04-09 22:59:40)

Awne looks up at him and blinks "what do you mean?" she asks tiredly

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-09 23:04:11)

Human: "I mean that you'll die if you make one sudden move."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-04-09 23:08:26)

Awne frowns at him "I haven't moved since you told us not to, I haven't spoken until you asked me something..I'm being rreally quite docile in all this forr a prrisonerr."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-09 23:15:12)

Human: "And if you continue to do as asked you won't get hurt."

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-04-09 23:23:13)

Awne: "Don't see me putting up a fight.."

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-13 13:15:05)

The guard finishes unraveling the power cables around Awne. He points his blaster rifle at her and Dexer.
Human: "Ok you two, out the door."
Dexer looks at Awne with desperation in his eyes.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **zerah** (2008-04-13 14:58:08)

Awne stands slowly, then moves slowly moves over to the other human and helps him up. "Come on Dex..we'rre in no condition to do anything.." She gives him a sympathetic look.

---

## Re: Chapter 3 (Unknown Location/ Awne's Thread)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-04-15 18:28:30)

The Human brings up his comlink and speaks into it, keeping his eye on Awne and Dexer.
Human: "Where is the enemy located? I want to make sure not to run into them."
After a few seconds, he tries again.
Human: "Anybody! Come in! I don't want to get slaughtered here! Ugh....DAMMIT!"
He grabs Awne by her shoulders with his left hand, and walks out of the room with the blaster rifle dug into her back. He hides behind Awne, using her as cover.
Human: "Stay in front of her!"
Dexer complies and walks in front of Awne as you pass through a short distance to another door.....
