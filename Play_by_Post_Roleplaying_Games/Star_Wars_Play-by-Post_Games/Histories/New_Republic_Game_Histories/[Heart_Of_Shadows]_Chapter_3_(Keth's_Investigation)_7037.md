Keth waves goodbye as the group approaches the settlement's gates. He turns and looks toward the expansive residential area, wondering where to begin.

Looking at the mammoth task ahead of him Keth decides to first head back to the cantina he was at earlier and begin his search from there.
*Gather information 1+d20*

Keth walks back into the cantina he just left, people seem to be gambling and drinking just as they were doing a while ago. *What question are you asking for your check?*

He first looks to see if the thugs from earlier are still present.
Being as suddle as he can he begins to ask the bartender if he recognizes the description of the person we are looking for.

*Are you using gather info to ask many people or just the bartender?*

*I don't remember the SWSE rule but the D&D is that you get on Gather info for X hrs. I will follow any rule that you lay out. I can do a separate check for each interaction or one check for X hrs of inquiring. Up to you.*

*Gather information check 1+4=5. We will just do it by the rulebook. You spend 1 hour of game time seeking this information. When one hour elapses with the others, I'll give you the results.*

*Also, are you asking for this person by name?*

No not by name just description.

*Depending on the results Keth will head out looking for clues elsewhere.*

*Ok, you have to wait one hour of the party's time though. It's 4:15 their time, at 5 you can rejoin them. You can comlink them at anytime though. Just post the comlink message to their thread. Keep in mind they have to answer it first.*

*Keth is not aware of any changes in the plan so when the hour is up he will head out and continue searching for the missing person. Given that he has had no luck with just using a description he will resort to using the persons name. As I said this is not the characters strong suit…*

*Ok, you might want to call the other characters…as they wanted you to keep them posted.*

Keth spends a considerable amount of time talking to the patrons of Racer's Bend. However, they seem to have no clue about the person that Keth is describing. It seems that even if they did know, they would not care to tell Keth. After about one hour total, Keth finds himself asking people outside of the cantina to no avail. The answer always seems to be that they haven't seen him or too many people match that description.
*It's still 4:16 with the other group. You can comlink them at any time. However, you cannot join them until an hour passes on their side.*

Keth walks outside of Racer's Bend with his questioning. He spots a few passerby and approaches them, as he does, a brown-skinned Rodian stops him. He is wearing a yellow flight suit that seems to give him the look of a veteran spacer.
Rodian: "Greetings, I'm Adeen. I heard you are looking for someone in particular; you mind telling me who this person is? I might be able to help you."
