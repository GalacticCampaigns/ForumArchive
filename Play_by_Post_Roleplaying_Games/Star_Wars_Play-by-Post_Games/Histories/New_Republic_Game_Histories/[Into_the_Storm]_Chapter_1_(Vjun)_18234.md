# [Into the Storm] Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-30 15:15:15)

The formation of marines and Jedi continue to trudge through the ankle-high sand of Vjun. Each member seems to be actively scanning, but no matter how alert they are, they can't see very well in the dense rain. All they could really see is the prominent terrain features in the distance, which was huge mountains. Hadru was able to use his survival skills to keep the formation of the unit in the right direction, with a little help from Lues as well. It was doubtful they were going to get lost with everyone working together.
Hadru and Gor' Ak both sensed something through the Force that some life form was approaching the point men from the south. Though the two men could not see it. At that moment they felt the life form, Hadru and Xander heard a distinctive metallic clanking coming from the south. It sounded like a large metal footfall, followed by gears rotating, then another footfall...in quick succession. The personnel in the main formation could neither see nor hear this movement, only the point men were aware of this sound. Awne and Gor' Ak were aware of the approaching life form. *Hadru and Gor gain 100 experience for their checks.*

"Xander hold up we might be running into trouble here." Vor'en suddenly take a more defenceive posture. "Everyone speard out, don't bunch together. Team 2 cover rear and right flank, Team one cover front and let flank. Xander make your way back to us. Call out if you see anything." Vor'en raises he weapon into a ready postion. "Jedi cover the shooters and help out where you can." Vor'en almost seems to come to life at the tention of the battle to come. A few on the team understand that this is his element that he is turely himself in these situations.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-09-30 15:37:28)

Gor couldnÂ´t really shake the feeling that something was about to go amiss as he proceeded through the rain and the sand. Perhaps it was just the inhosptiable terrain, but this place was starting to annoy him. However, all such thoughts disappeared as something struck him. He didnÂ´t know hoe he knew it, but he knew something was coming towards them. He turns to Dor.
"Stay sharp, somethingÂ´s coming"
At about the same moment, the sergeantÂ´s orders came over the comm, followed by XanderÂ´s notice about droids.
"You heard the man, letÂ´s move out"
Pulling out his Ion Pistol, Gor starts to advance forward, to get in a better position to see what was going on, and cover the front as instructed.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-30 15:40:52)

Xander hits the zoom button on his electrobinoculars. The binos whirr as they zoom in. Xander spots a huge machine through the thick rain. It was about 70 meters away. It stood about 8.6 meters tall and had two chicken shaped legs made of durasteel, its feet were also made of durasteel. It had a "head" which served as the cockpit with double-lasers mounted on its "chin". It also had two weapons on each side of its head, one appeared to be a grenade launcher and the other seemed to be a blaster cannon. Xander remembered this from his days when Red Team went against the Remnant, it was none other than a AT-ST. It doesn't seem to have noticed him yet as it walking in a different direction. It was odd through because the sensors should have picked him up. It was possible the acid rain was causing interference and the pilot was only relying on visual scanning. *Xander can make a knowledge tactics check as a reaction.*

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-30 15:50:10)

Xander estimates from his tactical mind that it would be best to drop to the prone and let the small sand dunes give them some form of concealment. If the sensors didn't pick them up then there was a good chance the AT-ST would walk right past the formation and not see them in this heavy rain if they were low to the ground. If they ran away they would definitely get notice from the AT-ST.

"Everyone down now! Go prone." Vor'en keeps his carbine straight ahead of him hoping that Xander was right and they wouldn't have to try to take it down. Over the comm link. "Keep comm chatter down only call out if you see anything." "Keep cover formation, cover your areas." Vor'en thinks back to when he was with the Reminate. He rembers what AT-ST looked like and how they prefromed they where a pain to to take on, unless of course you had one yourself and they didn't.

Woroken follows the lead of the remainder of the group and hits the mud. "Great, first rain, now mud." He hears Vor's com message and wonders how the group could take out a walker, especially since by his experience, if there is one walker out there, it was a good bet there were more.
He takes his hand from his lightsaber and pulls the bowcaster he always carried. If damage had to be dealt from afar, he much preferred that to a blaster.
While lying in the mud in wait, the wookiee padawan decided to try and sense Mur Eva again. He hated for the group to slow down, but they did not want to be discovered this early.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-30 17:50:13)

Xander patiently watches the AT-ST in his electrobinoculars. It seemed the walker had come to a complete stop, facing his direction. He seriously doubted that the walker had seen him though. On closer inspection, Xander also saw that the AT-ST was a bit rusted and in bad condition.
Back in the main formation, Dorijidan seeks cover behind a small dune in the sand. It would help him stay covered for now, but the sand was turning to mud quickly. Gor' Ak also gets cover behind a dune, though it was unlikely the sand would stop anything, it would help him stay concealed. He tried to concentrate but he really couldn't see much in the dense rain. The entire squad had followed Vor'en's command and gotten prone.
Awne, Feldon, Kel-Yun, Lues, and Woroken are all lying down in the sand, a short distance away from Vor'en. Awne isn't able to see much and she hears the whisper of Lorhas to Woroken.
Lorhas: "Sense anything my young padawan?"
Feldon has a look like he hates the planet already, and he seemed upset his robes were getting dirty.
Woroken stretches out through the Force and can sense Mur Eva faintly. They were slowly but surely getting close to her, and she seemed to be doing ok for the moment.

Theos hears the clatter going over the comm and wonders why every falls prone when battle is so much more fun then lying in the mud. Theos being a war veteran himself knows that where there is one giant scout there is most likly more aroudn that are on foot. With his helmat package working properly Theos scans the area for footmen around the nearby area. Not kneeling in the mud the Feeorin is not afraid of a challange no matter what the size. :

Xander observes the AT-ST cautiously. He can faintly see the figure of the pilot inside. To his surprise, the pilot points at Xander and Hadru as if he was about to set up an attack run! Hadru is not able to see any of the AT-ST's actions at the moment, nor could he hear it moving.

### **Frost** (2008-09-30 21:35:49)

Xander ducks down quickly. He looks over to Hadru.
"Frak it saw me. Head back and warn the others, Im gonna move around and try to draw them away from the group. Don't use the commlink they might pick up the signal. Hurry!"
Xander sprint away from the group using the dune as cover. He manuevers his way around placing the At-ST inbetween himself and the squad.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-09-30 23:08:05)

Xander quickly moves in a wide radius around the AT-ST so he couldn't be spotted. He finds it a little difficult to keep his balance due to the mud and rain, but moves effectively nonetheless. Xander maneuvers to the backside of the AT-ST until he is about thirty meters away from it. Now he must decide what his next move is.

"Unless you are packing a portable E-web you are not even going to dent it, if you could even see it that is." Vor'en keeps scaning the area with his scope try to figure out where it might be coming from. "Everyone, when we move I want tea one left flank team two right flank. Stagger it so we can cover rear and front also. Call out if you see it and what location. Lance Call the Lt. and inform her of situation." Vor'en hopes not to have to call in an air stike against the walker. it would be good to keep the ship as a surprize for later.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-10-01 01:15:37)

*I studied the rules a bit more and I ruled that basically if you have line of sight (with nothing in between you and the target) to anything large or bigger, you don't need to roll to see it. Except maybe if you had concealment or cover penalties. The AT-ST in the rain is -5, so that brings its DC to spot 0. You would see it. You wouldn't apply range penalties to anything large or better that you had line of sight to as well. Once you come upon anything medium or small is when you add the range penalties. So, treat the rest of the game as if you spotted the AT-ST already, and you are all in the prone hiding from its vision. Other than that, nothing else has changed. Xander I need a stealth check if you are trying to avoid being heard by the AT-ST pilot.*

Theos now knows the sarge has a marble loose if he thinkgs only an e-web can dent that thing.
Theos: "Sarge I am anti armor that thing is all armor. In case you forgat I have the firepower to take it out. Now do we have clearance to take out the walker or are we going to hide from it?"
Theos to Lance: "Come Lance we shall show this puny squad what team two is all about!" Half dragging the human Theos takes off to flank the walker.
Theos drops his rifle and lets the sling take hold of it around his shoulder and pulls out the blaster cannon when in position.

Gor listened intently to the conversation, while keeping the walker under surveillence. As he saw Xander jump on top of it, he shook his head and drew out his sporting blaster. The more accurate weapon would serve him well if he had to take shots over the great distance at people on the walker.
As he hears (and possibly sees), Theos shots blast towards the walker, he flinches a little, but keeps his aim steady.

Theos begins moving the 170 meter distance towards the AT-ST, he stays on its flank, working up to its right side. The Feeorin tries his best not to slip as he running a good stretch to catch up with the walker. However, he's not able to get to the best distance before Xander initiates his attack. He gets about 75 meters(50 squares) away on the rusty walker's right flank as Xander gets next to the legs of the AT-ST and powers up his jet pack. Theos realizes he had to act now and dives for some cover behind one of the small dunes. The Feeorin could not see any other targets but the AT-ST. The AT-ST begins moving as Xander is flying up to the top of the AT-ST.
Back in the Jedi's position, Feldon rolls over in the mud, drawing his lightsaber.
Feldon: "My young padawan, now I realize it wasn't worth getting my robes dirty as these warmongers have initiated a fight that could of been avoided."

Realizing there wasn't anything he could do to the walker he scanned the area again making sure there wasn't any ground scouts.

Time slows around Aymaric as he sees the blaster bolt leave the barrel of the cannon, vaporizing water form the weapon and the surrounding air. The expression on his face turns from one of utterly childish glee to one of morbid curiosity as he realized the cannon bolt's path would now bring it dangerously close to one of the other Soldiers.

Woroken heeds the Jedi Master's advice, not wanting Xander to face injury or worse to the AT-ST. He stands from the mud, and begins moving up to get a better shot. The rain is pouring down on his robes and making things worse as he ran on top the slippery surface to close the distance. This would be a good movement before he could get into decent firing range, as the point element was a good 170 meters away from the main formation. Luckily, he doubted the AT-ST would see him or either bother with him as he had someone about to jet pack on its hull.
Xander continues his upward flight and lands awkwardly on top of the AT-ST. He is unable to keep his balance as his legs kick in front of him and he falls on his back. The slope of the AT-ST's head combined with the wet surface of the walker sends him sliding off the side of the hulking machine. He falls to the right side and is able to *(Climb check;reaction)* grab paneling to keep himself from falling completely. Xander was now dangling with the front of his body against the right side of the AT-ST's head. He would have to hold on and attempt to pull himself up.
Theos watches everything from his prone position from the right flank of the AT-ST, he watches Xander nearly slide off the AT-ST as he is about to pull the trigger of his anti-armor weapon. Was it worth still pulling the trigger with Xander in the way?

Vor'en moves quickly towards the front of the AT-ST through the stinging rain. Now that Theos had engaged the walker from its right flank, it was only logical to assault the AT-ST from the front. He watches as the blaster cannon bolt zips past the walker without any damage. Xander seemed to be hanging on with all his strength. Perhaps it would be interesting to see how his squad would function as an infantry unit, as this was there first fight. Although it was typically not New Republic standard to fire in the vicinity of friendlies. The walker doesn't seem to be moving yet.

Gor 'Ak watches as Vor'en sprints toward the AT-ST. He scans the area and can see nothing in sight amongst the mountain stretches and the expansive flat area. The rain continued to come down hard, and he can sense nothing in the immediate area besides the walker. He wasn't able to tell how many occupants were in the AT-ST, though there was something definitely alive in there. After moving up about three meters toward the walker, he drops to the sand which was gradually forming into mud. He low crawls behind a lump in the ground and continually scans the area. His feelings tell him it is very unlikely that the AT-ST would target him at this distance, so he was relatively safe. The question is, was he in a good position to assist his companions against the menacing AT-ST?

Meanwhile, the AT-ST primes its grenade launcher and the walker cumbersomely faces Hadru's direction. The turret swivels and fires a grenade at Hadru's prone position with a thump. The grenade blast envelops Hadru's body in a mist of sand, mud, and debris. The AT-ST finishes the area off with a burst of blaster fire.

Dorijidan hears the confirmation from Gor 'Ak and takes off in a sprint towards the AT-ST, attempting to close distance between him and the hulking machine. He notices he was not the only one charging the AT-ST. Woroken seemed to be doing the same thing. Dorijidan remembers in his tactics that you must lay down cover fire if you want to move. Essentially, Theos is keeping the walker occupied with his flanking attack. So in theory, the entire unit should be able to move safely as long as Theos kept the vehicle preoccupied. Theos was living up to his role as anti-armor nicely.
As the Jedi lay in the mud, Feldon nods to Awne and they all stand. Lues, Lorhas, and Feldon draw their respective lightsabers. The Jedi didn't activate their lightsabers, more than likely to keep themselves harder to see from the walker.

Aymaric takes off in a sprint from where he and the Bothan were gathering. He kept his eye on the smoke coming from Hadru's position, although he could not see Hadru himself. The Falsoor employee also noticed Awne running towards this area.
While Xander is attempting to get inside the AT-ST; the walker's speed picks up dramatically and it propels forward. Everyone watches as the walking vehicle is now closing with them. The vehicle had passed Hadru's position on its right side and it had ran out of alignment with Theos. Theos would now have to aim better to shoot at an angle toward the AT-ST's backside. It was handling itself well in the muddy environment.
*It is now Lance's turn.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-10-24 16:41:18)

The AT-ST was getting closer as it galloped through the mud and rain. Lance Starfell moved ahead, crouched low to the ground in a effort to gain ground yet stay defensive. However, Lance was still a nice distance *(83 squares)* away from it. He seemed to be facing in the direction of its front. The walker didn't seem to be targeting any of his comrades at the moment, it was just moving very quickly. The vehicle seemed to be stepping very awkwardly as it moved fast towards the general area of the group. *It is now Dorijidan's turn.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-10-25 16:39:34)

*Dorijidan is 113 squares away.* Dor watches closely as the AT-ST had began movement towards their position with Xander on top of the vehicle. He knew he had to get closer for his weapons to be effective. So far the tactic of Xander and Hadru taking point had kept fire off the main body of the formation, allowing them to get into a better vantage point. Dorijidan runs toward the AT-ST, which was now running towards his general area.
Back at the Jedi's position, isolated from Vor'en and the others, Lorhas gives out commands to his fellow Jedi.
Lorhas: "Allright men, Beta pattern. Feldon, comm the sergeant and let him know."
Lues chuckles at the Jedi Master.
Lues: "Are you quick enough for this?"
Lorhas: "Quicker than you, and there's no time. Execute."
The Jedi Master illuminates the murky area around him with his brilliant emerald lightsaber. The rain sizzles as it strikes the lightsaber. He waves it in a defiant motion in the air, trying to get the walker's attention. He begins trotting to its front. Lues matches Lorhas' speed, but keeps his lightsaber deactivated. Feldon pulls out his comm link and sends a message to Vor'en.
Feldon: "Sergeant, we're going to have Master Lorhas run right through the walker's position to draw its fire. Watch what your men target because we're going to assist Xander to take the walker down. We'll be right next to it."
Feldon says this as he is picking up running speed next to his fellow Jedi, his lightsaber remains deactivated.

Awne continues her sprint towards Hadru's smoking position. Slowly but surely she was gaining ground towards the area. The walker sped past without seemingly noticing her. At that distance the vehicle's sensors would of picked her up, but it is unknown what the AT-ST's intentions are at this point, other than fighting. She could only hope she made it to Hadru in time. *Awne is now 52 squares away from Hadru's position. It is now Woroken's turn.*

Woroken was torn whether to fire a shot at the walker. He finally decided it was too risky to shoot with Xander still exposed. He drops his bowcaster and draws his lightsaber, keeping it unignited. He continues toward the walker, hoping it would not notice him, until he could close to melee.

Xander quiets his mind despite the bouncing AT-ST hull beneath his feet. His rope keeps him steady as he holds onto the railing jutting from the ground. He can feel Woroken's presence approaching through the rain and sandy mud. He stretches his mind out and communicates a small message about Woroken's Jedi sword. Woroken could guess that he wanted his lightsaber. As Xander speaks through the Force, he can feel the AT-ST picking up speed as he hears the gears whirring and the gyro mechanism churning. *It is now Theos' turn.*

After hearing what Feldon had told him, Vor'en can belive his ears. "Roger that Feldon. Tell your master to becareful and I will pass it along." Switching to the squad comm signal. "Jedi in bound on target, clear target before you fire. Repeat friendlys heading into combat zone, clear your targets. Over." Vor'en hopes that Theos will do as intructed. If not there was going to have to be an exsample made of him. That was something Vor'en was not looking forward to.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-10-29 04:41:16)

Theos remained in his prone position in the mud. The rain was dripping off his blaster cannon and he aligned the sights with the AT-ST as it was stomping towards his companions. He heard Vor'en's instructions and figured that the best choice was not to fire on the AT-ST while Xander was on top. *Theos readies an action to attack when Xander is no longer an issue with the AT-ST.

Vor'en still couldn't belive that the Jedi where going to make frontal assualt on the walker, but he had seen stranger things in his life. Continueing to run into the combat zone hoping that he could pull as many of his squad out as he could before this whole battle goes wrong. "Awne, I still need the status of Hardu."

The veteran of the Empire and Republic realizes that now a good portion of the unit was rushing the front of the AT-ST. In order for this work, there needed to be fire keeping the walker occupied. No one seemed to be shooting as Xander was on top of the machine. He pressed forward in his sprint through the slippery and muddy terrain. His helmet was moving around with his running, and he was trying his best to give out commands despite the pick up of his breathing. *Vor'en is now 67 squares from the walker.

Gor continued to lay in the mud, feeling powerless to destroy the AT-ST as of right now. He rolled over behind a mound of sand/mud to gain some concealment. *Stealth rating 28.*This was definitely Theos' area of responsibility, which was Anti-Armor. He watched the walker as it was gradually picking up speed with Xander strapped to the top of its head. The vehicle was still at least 142 meters away, but it was closing fast.
Woroken and Gor both feel a tingle in the Force, although Woroken's perception of the Force is more distinct than Gor's. Woroken could not pinpoint what exactly the Force was telling him, although it was emanating from Mur Eva somewhere in the distance of the planet.

*Continue movement to Hadru. Full round action unless I can reach him sooner.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-10-31 04:47:29)

Despite the growing fatigue in Aymaric's body, he continued to press on toward the person he barely knew. He was gaining ground towards the smoking area that was where Hadru was last seen. Aymaric could not see any trace of him from his current position.
The AT-ST speeds up into a hopping motion with its two long legs. Within six seconds, it has hopped 150 meters through the formation of Vor'en's squad and beyond them. If it kept heading in that course it would run into the *Starshade* eventually. Everyone who was darting towards the walker now found it a considerable distance behind them, though it was closer to some. The walker had effectively ran past the entire formation. Xander managed to hang on with his rope enduring his weight as the inertia was pulling at him. *It is now Lance's turn.*

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **master_Tru** (2008-10-31 07:33:48)

Lance opens the com again "Starshade come in I think you have been had. The chicken is heading your way. We will try to slow it down." Lance makes another move towards it this time trying to close the distance.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-11-03 00:46:13)

Lance communicates via his headset as the AT-ST rushes past the position of the formation. It had now gotten a little further from him and it didn't seem like it was going to stop. A chirp is heard in Lance's headset as the Mon Calamarian responds.
Lt. Baruush: "Ok, I have to power the ship up. I was doing repairs on the vehicle, so it might take a few minutes to get in the air."
Lance sprints toward the walker through the sand and mud, doing his best not to slip from the problematic rain. It was very unlikely he could catch the thing at this speed though. It had reached the peak of its movement. *Lance is now 59 squares away from the speeding walker. It is currently Dorjidan's turn. Does anyone have any questions about what is happening in combat?*

Dor considered his position. The walker just raced through the entire squad. Now was the time to hit it.
But with Xander in the firing zone and orders to not fire, Dor really didn't have any options. At least
the Starshade could deal with this. Having spread out from his squad mates, it was time to regroup.
Let's see, I left Gor'Ak...there.
OOC Run to Gor'Ak's position and take cover. Wait for orders.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

Dorjidan looks in the direction where Gor' Ak was last seen. He could not see him now, but he ran back to the area where Gor 'Ak was last occupying. Sure enough, he was prone behind a small dune as rain was pouring on both of them. *You didn't quite have enough actions to take cover, you have just gotten to Gor Ak's position.*
Most everyone in the squad can see the Jedi standing up in the center of the formation that had now become quite dispersed. Master Lorhas' lightsaber remained activated and it presented a green beacon to everyone in eye sight. The Jedi quickly surged forward in a sprint at mesmerizing speed that made them look like a blur. The Force was powering their movement and it was quite a sight to behold. They clear about 90 meters at the end of their movement; It seems they were gaining ground on the AT-ST. Xander looked behind him and saw the Jedi hot on the walker's heels. *It is now Awne's turn.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-11-04 18:05:31)

Awne noticed that the Jedi were on her five o clock. They were heading a great distance in a short time away from her. She looked over towards the smoke where Hadru had laid and continued her unrelenting sprint toward him, or what was left of him. As the Farghul is moving, she hears a little beep next to her coming from the ground. In a blinding flash an explosive blast kicks up in a storm of mud and rain drops. Awne is propelled 3 meters in the air and lands prone in the mud. She felt the sting of the blast all over her body, and she guessed from her tactical experience that this was a minefield. She had just walked into a mine. *Awne is now 65 squares from Hadru's position. It is now Woroken's turn.*

Surprised by the amazing speed of the chicken walker, the wookiee was now too far away to effort his lightsaber to the soldier hanging onto the walker. "I'll never catch up to that thing," he thought to himself. As the walker was no immediate threat now, and he was removed from any action, Woro takes the time to focus on the force disturbance he felt only a few seconds prior--"Where are you, Mur Eva?" he asked with his mind.

Everyone on the battlefield could see the explosion knock Awne into the air. She seemed to land ok. Woroken turned his thoughts to get some kind of idea of what was going on with Mur Eva. The Wookiee felt so close in reaching out to Mur Eva with the Force. However, the presence of the Dark Side was much stronger than his attunement to the mystic energy. It was as if Mur Eva was responding positively to the Wookiee but something was shrouding her being. *Woroken gains 100 experience for a successful UtF check. It is now Xander's turn.*

Awne groaned, there was a horrible ringing in her ears and her head hurt.

That damn ringing was still in her ears, making it hard for her to pick up sounds, and the ache in her head made concentrating on a sound harder. Still, she yells "MINEFIELD!" then winces as her head hurt more.

Xander can feel the AT-ST hull shake violently beneath him as he stands partially bent over to absorb the shock. As the walker had reached its maximum speed, the slippery surface coupled with the violent rocking knocks Xander off the AT-ST. The rope stretches out and is unable to catch Xander as he falls eight meters into the mud. The cable extends to its maximum length and begins dragging Xander through the slippery ground. *Xander takes seven falling damage. It is now Theos' turn.*

Vor'en keeps moving toward the target trying to get in range. Moving carefully he trys to not get himself blown up in the process. "Awne, are you ok? Do you need assiants, over."

Theos acknowledges the order given by his squad leader. He moves up a few meters and takes a knee. He brings the sights of his blaster cannon to rest on the AT-ST that almost looked like it was skipping across the muddy terrain. He fires a shot from the blaster cannon and the massive recoil pushes back hard into his shoulder. The shoulder fired weapon emitted a loud blast as the humongous bolt went wide of the targeted walker. Theos had missed.
Sgt. Vor'en watched the bolt soar over his head as he was rushing toward the AT-ST. This battle was not going very well. Although his squad was responding well to his orders; Awne was down and Xander was being dragged through the mud. It was very possible that Hadru was either wounded or killed. This had been one of the harder battles he had faced in his times with Red Team. It was up to his leadership and the others to pull them out of the battle they encountered on this barren planet. It would be nice to see the *Starshade* above their heads. *Vor'en is now 43 squares away from the AT-ST. It is now Gor Ak's turn.*

The AT-ST was now traveling at 90 kilometers an hour. Xander is being dragged violently across the mud and sand. He realizes he has to detach or face injury or death. Xander unclips the cable and slides to a halt in the mud, his armor was now filthy. The AT-ST is galloping fast enough that it has effectively retreated. It would be impossible to catch it at this point and shooting at it would likely be a waste of ammunition. It continues to run away from the group in the *Starshade's* direction.
The Jedi stop running and kneel down, scanning for any other targets. The rain hasn't stopped and it was as miserable as ever. *Combat has ended. You all gain 800 experience.*

The walker was well out of range now and seemed to have no interest in the soft squishy targets after it fired on the scout.
The mines were another issue though. How many, what pattern, and why was the Farghul still moving through what might be a very dense mine field, especially with available assets that could extract the wounded without further losses? After stopping his headlong run and between gasps of breath, Aymaric is able to call out "HEY...LADY...STOP MOVING,...YOU CAN GET HIM OUT WITH...THE SHIP!
While walking towards the Farghul's position, the young unarmored, former security medic of Farsool, thinks to himself that the scout might actually be alive if the slightly burnt catwoman is still able to walk after being hit by a mine. Are they all Jedi?

Awne carefully scours the ground with her eyes to the area around her. She cannot see any mines, and doesn't move as it would be unwise to continue through if she couldn't see them. It would likely require someone skilled in explosives *mechanics* to figure out how they would be hidden and disarm them.
Meanwhile, Gor 'Ak carefully observes his surroundings. Indeed, the rain was continuous and it showed no signs of stopping. He looked in the distance and could see nothing but vast rocky mountain ranges. The atmosphere gave off a tan/orange aura instead of blue as most planets did. It made for a very barren presentation. This planet was definitely not a vacation spot, but yet it seemed perfect for a military operation. He could see no targets in range however.

Switching back to thee sqaud channel "Gor be carefull in your area we have no idea how big the mine field is. So use caution." Vor'en hopes that the ship will get here soon. "Lance I need an E.T.A on the ship."

*"Good she heard me"* thought Aymaric, while he continued to move towards the now stationary Feline. *"Alright, new plan."*
*Aymaric will move towards Awne's position, starting a few meters directly behind her, he will stop and take a bit of time to look for irregularites or exposed mines due to the rain. After that he will use any information he gained and attempt to determine the minefield layout.
PERCEPTION +9 skill, taking 20 =29. MECHANICS(explosives) +9 skill, taking 20 =29. This should take a total of 4 minutes.

The wookiee continued to stand motionless in the middle of the terrain. He wanted to run over and help Awne and Hadru, but that would accomplish nothing if he were blown up before he got there.
"Hold on Hadru," Woroken growled.

Aymaric cautiously moves toward Awne's position. The former Falsoor employee can quickly notice the oddities of some of the dunes. He lays flat on his stomach wisely and slowly crawls past Awne. Aymaric's experience with explosives knows that it's better to have as little body mass around it as possible, especially if these mines were activated by weight. He crawls slowly and wades his hand through the mud, attempting to dig out mines. After a couple of minutes he finds an anti-personnel mine that is triggered by weight. It would take some time to disarm the explosive. Based on the two mines that he's found, he guesses its a staggered formation of mines spread about 5 meters apart to destroy people. It would take some time to clear through the mine field safely.
As Aymaric is doing this, the *Starshade* hovers into view. The wash from the ship blows mud and rain everywhere. Vor'en's comlink chirps.
Lt. Baruush: "What do you need me for Sergeant?"
*Aymaric gains 300 experience for discovering the pattern of the mine field.*

A few seconds after the transmission from the *Starshade*, another com burst was coming towards Vor. His radio was getting flooded.
Lorhas: "Sergeant, we can't move any better than you can. You might want to warn the Lieutenant about setting down, there could be anti-vehicle mines out here as well. I've noticed in my years that usually anti -personnel and anti-vehicle go hand in hand."

"Lt. I need the Starshade's scanners. We have personel in the middle of a mine field." Vor'en waits for more reports to flood in. "We also might have anti-vechicle mine in the area. Becareful on landing in the area."
Vor'en hopes that this can be resloved quickly so they can move and quit being an easy target. "Squad set up and perimater and stand by for orders."

The walker you encountered is fleeing from this area. I'd say you are relatively safe at the moment, no other blips on the sensors."

Laying in the mud, again, Aymaric wonders how the scout made it to the middle of the minefield without setting one of them off. Thinking of a plan, he stands and turns his attention towards the stationary female, "You should be able to carefully turn around and retrace your steps out of this minefield, it seems to end a couple meters back."
He turns towards the minefield and stands up, tries to pick out the path left by the, almost certanly dead, scout. He also attempts to see any signs of life where the scout should be.

Lance communicates with the Starshade and it lands about 50 meters to the formation's six o' clock. On planet Vjun that would be northwest. The landing ramp door lowers with a hiss of steam that envelops the lowering platform. *Vor'en the sensor pack will not enable you to detect the mines. Aymaric informed you that the mines are weight-activated and do not emit any signals for the sensor pack to pick up.*
Lt. Baruush: "Landed safely, the bay door is down if you need anything. I don't think I'll be able to move the *Starshade* up further than this due to the threat of the mines. We want to make sure we have extraction as this is our only form right now. There are too many ravines and canyons to land safely elsewhere. I wouldn't worry about the walker it has move due north about a kilometer now. It seems as if it is retreating. Your team must have scared him."

Awne winces, now that she wasn't moving she could feel how much she ached and what's worse that damn ringing was getting louder. She wasn't sure how that was possible, but it was and it was giving her a bigger headache then she had before "would someone please turrn off that blasted rringing." She mutters into the comlink, it couldn't just be her, it just couldn't.
Someone's gear was giving off a high pitched tone and it was causing her sensative ears to ring. Has to be the reason, it just had to be. She didn't want to think for a minute that the blast had done more to her hearing then she was willing to admit.

Vor'en easily gets to Awne's position in a few seconds. It seems she had walked into the beginning of the mine formation. The LT sends yet another transmission to the Staff Sergeant.
Lt. Baruush: "Sergeant, you need to handle your casualties quickly and find a way past these mines. Anyone who can't continue can wait in here."

Awne smiles at the soldier, formalities be damned she was relieved to see him and quickly hugs him, letting him go just after. She'd make up for it later but for now they had work to do still. A few blinks at the force stirring in her before her master was speaking.
Thank the stars for the force, she didn't think she'd beable to understand hm if he had tried to com her, let alone hear it beeping. A quick reply hoping he'd understand what she ment in such a few words, well..word. *"Hearring"* She just hopped he would understand that the ringing she had muttered about on the com was in her ears, though she hated to admit it.
At Vor'ens question however, she was left blinking trying to read his lips "what?" she asks, rather loudly at that.

*The minefield has not been cleared out. In order to get to Hadru safely you'd have to clear the mines out one-by-one. Or, you could just risk walking through it. As far as you guys know, the mine formation starts where Awne had stopped walking. Anything north of Awne is relatively safe. So if you go that way Woro you will have to take your time and risk getting blown up.*
Lt. Baruush coms Vor'en.
Lieutenant: "Sergeant, the Jedi have updated me on the situation. We don't know what we're dealing with the walker. We don't know what the Remnant would be doing out here. This used to be one of their old base of operations a long time ago. Your orders are to set a security perimeter and have an explosives expert crawl his way to Hadru. Get a head count from all your men as you set up security. Once your wounded is handled move out. Bring any of the personnel that can't continue to the *Starshade*. You've got 40 minutes."
The Staff Sergeant looks around to his men spread out across the open area.
Vor'en: "You heard the Lieutenant! Set up a security perimeter! Aymaric, crawl your way to Hadru with Woro and disarm any mines in the way. Aymaric and Woro stay dispersed, don't want both of you to get hurt if a mine goes. Everyone else, stay North of Awne's position and create a line with 10 meters dispersion. You know the drill!"

Feldon walks over to Awne as it was relatively clear to her point. He pulls out his medical pouch that was attached to him. He scans her body with a small device to locate shrapnel and diagnoses her head trauma. He places his hand over Awne's forehead and within moments she can feel the soothing energy of the Force wrapping around her body. She can also feel Feldon removing the shrapnel and bandaging her skin with snythflesh. The Farghul feels much better and can hear now as well. *Awne regains 28 hp.

Vor'en realizes easily that The Remnant would be very unlikely to have any interest in this planet. They probably abandoned it years ago after the Pellaeon-Gavrisom treaty in which the Imperials declared peace with the New Republic. Most of the Remnant tended to stick near Bastion in a very isolated fashion. Tactically speaking, this planet served no use...as their forces had regrouped near Bastion to be left alone. While pondering this, Vor'en walked a few meters northwest to look for Xander. After scouring the ground for a bit, Vor'en finds Xander clad and prone in the mud. He seemed perfectly ok, though a bit hurt after the fall.

"Must have taken more damage from Awne then I thought I had. "Feldon if you are not to busy, I have need of your services. I seem to have forgotten about the injurys I took earlier on the Starshade."

After a few minutes Feldon approaches Vor'en.
Feldon: "Yes, I checked on the rest of the squad and they seem good. I'll treat you and Awne then we'll be all set. We can continue the search for Mur Eva and answers."
Feldon unstraps the brown camo vest off Vor'en and begins applying Force healing techniques. Vor'en can feel a regenerative aura that tingles with life energy. He feels his wounds beginning to slowly mend. These wounds were caused by Awne's claws and lightsaber burns. It was a painful reminder. Feldon then nods to Vor'en and travels back to Awne to administer more care. The young Jedi Knight had always been there for Red Team or anyone traveling with them. He would always give aid despite the dangers and always had a smile on his face. He was certainly a compassionate Jedi; most definitely an offset to Mur Eva. The Knight opens a medpac and applies synthflesh followed by bandages to Awne's burned skin.
Feldon: "Right, how do you feel? Can you continue with the mission? This treatment is beginning to wear me out though, heh."

Feldon: "Shew, thanks Woro. That seems to be just what I needed. Do you know what was going on with Xander?"
The Jedi Knight speaks as he stands up a bit to get a look at the rest of the team to assess them medically.
Feldon: "Sergeant, that should be everyone, minus Hadru."
*I roll the dice Aymaric. There is no need for you to include that in your skill checks.* 
Aymaric continues to low crawl past the first mine he had discovered, staying well out of its detonation proximity. However, he has a hard time locating any mines as they were especially well hidden. He relays to Sgt. Vor'en that the mines are particularly hard to spot. Aymaric is forced to sit still and continue looking. He can see where Hadru was laying, and there doesn't seem to be anything left except a small impact crater from the AT-ST's grenades. *Sgt.

While Feldon is speaking to the group huddled around Aymaric, the Jedi Master Kel-Yun approaches him.

Lorhas turns to the group with a solemn look on his face.
Lorhas: "I'm afraid the young Hadru Kazo has passed away. You should rejoice in his death however. He possessed no binding to be out here, he had no allegiances as do we. He had no Jedi Order or faith in the Republic ways; he had no greed. He sought only to journey with his companions. In one perspective, you could say he had a more pure reasoning than we did, he did it for the love of his friends."

That ringing was back in her ears, blocking out the words of her master. She could feel something patting her shoulder but she wasn't sure what it was. Really the only thing that got through was the message from Vor'en, that was two now..two that died before her that she couldn't do anything to help.
She stopped struggling, somewhere in her that little voice was telling her they needed to get to Mur Eva; sick as it was, Hadru would still be there when they returned. She doesn't look to her master, nor to the wookiee, nor anyone. Only straightening her back and moving to follow Vor'en, her tail nearly dragging along the floor. She just didn't have the energy to lift it right now.

Since Red Team had begun their journey years ago on Tatooine, they had observed much death. In the efforts to save Rast Drorwen from the clutches of the Imperial Remnant from the times they dealt with the crime lord Bordo the Hutt, they were becoming well acquainted with death. Many comrades who had traveled with them had perished before, but this is the second person who was close to the group. Things like this could possibly cause the group to wonder, who was next? If they were to die, what would it be for? To rescue a Jedi? To investigate an organization? That's what the mission objectives are. The Jedi were trained to accept death as a part of life, and not to mourn; death was becoming one with the Force. The Republic military were trained to think about only the mission and accomplishing it; as if completing the mission brought salvation to the dead. The group decides to push on as SSgt. Vor'en gets his men into position.
1st Team which consisted of Gor' Ak and Dorijidan took point of the formation. They got forward of the group about a good 15 meters. In the center of the formation was the command element. This was Vor'en and the Jedi, and they all remained dispersed in case of area effect attacks. The 2nd Team of the squad provided rear guard for the formation. They too were away from the others by about 15 meters. Gor 'Ak stepped carefully with his eyes looking in every direction. He stretched his senses out but didn't feel anything suspicious around him. He felt a calm that was slightly eerie. The team leader couldn't see anything as well.
As the group began stepping in a wide circle to avoid the mines, a transmission is sent from the Lieutenant.
Lt. Baruush: "Are you heading off then Sergeant? Anything else you need?"

While the Jedi are forming to the soldiers tactical formation, Feldon walks over to Awne.
Feldon: "I sense much emotion that you are dealing with. You have great sadness brewing with in you. Remember, don't let it take hold of your mind. You're going to need the Force to help us find Mur Eva; you must take control of yourself before you use the Force... Let go of these feelings. They express your caring, but you do not need them now."

Her master may have been trying to help in his own Jedi Master way, but that wasn't what she wanted to hear. She wanted sympathy, wanted understanding wanting something to let her know it was ok to be in grief of her friend; he was trying to help, and that's what she kept telling herself even as her fur rose as anger started to seep into her mind. Towards both the imperials and even her master though she tried to keep a tight hold on it.

Awne could feel the Force tingling her sensations with intrigue. Feldon was guiding her ever so slightly through the Force. It seemed Awne was limited in her control, but not so much for an apprentice. The Farghul felt herself being tugged towards a certain direction in the presence of the Force. Feldon spoke to her directly, *"Come".* After a few seconds of focusing her spirit, she felt a slight echo that reminded her of Hadru's presence. She felt he had become one with the Force. Awne's training reflected back to the code. There is no such thing as death; being dead is a worldly term. Hadru had not died, he had transformed into that which brings all life. The enormity and complexity of the Force weighed down heavily upon the Farghul, but it seemed to make sense for now. *Awne gains 200 experience.*

Vor'en walks forward trying to remeber why he became a soldier in the frist place. It wasn't hard, his mother didn't want it so he did it. Of course she wanted to have him stationed some where he would not be able to get himself killed but he always found away out of it and into the combat zones. "Just like your father." is all she ever said.
Vor'en didn't know his father they had moved to the Reminate when he was very young, so he had know memory of his father. So he would imagine what his father was like a brave soldier, fighting the emenys of Reminate and always saving the day. But Vor'en now knows the reality of what a soldiers life. It is rearly glamorous, But it is all he knows. "Yes Lt. we are heading out on mission. Will call if we need anything. Vor'en out." He clears his head and continues on trying to complete the mission and bring everything back alive.

Lt. Baruush: "Roger Sergeant, proceed around the minefield, then continue southeast towards your objective. Use Lues Van as your guide to track down Mur Eva. While you are stepping out, I'll get eyes in the sky and try to find out about the Imperial equipment."
The formation steps even further away from the *Starshade* as it is powering up. Vor'en and Aymaric were working together to walk around the minefield, although it was taking some time. The acidic rain seem to show no evidence of it slowing down anytime soon. The ground had become very slippery and difficult to walk on. The unit was set to clear the mines in the direction of the mountain ranges and various rock beds. Troublesome terrain seemed to be in the near future for the group, possibly even some climbing. This terrain is likely why the freighter couldn't have landed closer to Mur Eva's position It was likely they had a lot of ground to cover. So far the terrain and weather of Vjun seemed to be sandy basins with surrounding mountains, with acidic rain and a dreary orange atmosphere. Rain and fog dominated there current surroundings which made it even more difficult to see.

Awne calms slowly at the feeling of Hadru in the force, still she was sad, but the notion of him not really being gone...only joining the force and still helping them through it was comforting. She bows her head, not able or not willing to turn to thank her master properly, only sending the words to him through the force.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-11-25 10:31:01)

Awne seemed to gain some comfort from the Force, however the Jedi Feldon wasn't sure how much the Farghul was actually adhering to her training.
The unit puts one foot ahead of the other as the weather remained miserable. They all attempted to remain alert despite the uncomfort. After a few minutes they clear the danger of the minefield and are now completely back on course to the southeast. Lues works with Vor'en to keep the patrol in the right direction. After a about a kilometer of walking, the sloping and rocky terrain that marked the beginning of the mountainous areas loomed into view. Sgt. Vor'en carefully observed the terrain and realized they had to move up after about another 600 meters.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-11-25 22:31:38)

The Republican military unit continues to trudge through the slippery mud of Vjun. Each member of the patrol does his or her best to watch for anything suspicious. *Remember, members of the Republic military gain +2 on perception checks while in formation.* Sgt. Vor'en moved his camo sleeve out of the way of his wrist and viewed his chrono. It had only been one hour and forty minutes into the mission and they were just coming up on two kilometers of movement. According to Lues his navigator, they still had quite some time before they got to Mur Eva. Everyone using the Force could barely sense her due to the cloud of the Dark Side.
Even the Wookiee Jedi was unable to communicate with the Jedi Knight telepathically. It seemed the dark veil was too thick for his abilities to penetrate. Woroken especially respected Mur Eva; her trial to become a Jedi Knight concluded when she united two rival Wookiee clans a few years back. The united clans then put an end to a local mercenary group who had been disrupting their way of life.
Gor 'Ak, who was on point for the formation, noticed the muddy flat ground began to fade into a rocky hill. He stopped at the rock formation and looked back towards the squad leader. Everyone in the formation halted and squatted on a knee. Each individual faced in different directions to cover every angle. Gor observed that the rock formation was the beginning of the mountains that were scattered across the south, southwest, and southeast. Their objective would lie somewhere in the harsh terrain, where the *Starshade* couldn't land.
Lues Van looked over to Vor'en as the formation paused.
Lues: "Sergeant, we'll have to have your squad proceed through the mountains...Mur Eva's presence is somewhere in there. What do you want to do?"
It was time for the Sergeant to analyze the situation and make a decision based on the terrain.

I heard a lot of you using Red Team so you'll be red seven. Your team leaders will be red 1 and red 2; your support's call sign is knight 1-3. My call sign is sierra main. I disabled the walker and it doesn't appear to have any other imperial equipment on board. I'm going to analyze the transponder and anything else I can find to determine the situation.

Woro was surprised he was unable to reach Mur Eva. The cloud of blackness and evil appeared too strong for him to penetrate. That worried him to no end.
"Let's go, everyone,", the wookiee growled impatiently. He listened to himself and realized he was allowing his emotions to rise much too quickly today, after the news about Mur Eva, and then after seeing Hadru blown up. He took a couple calming breaths and tried to center his emotions, calming himself. "I mean, when the squad is prepared, of course, Sergeant Vor'en," he followed up.

Looking around at the terain Vor'en realizes this why he hated not going in without good intell. "Lues, we got to go through this. I havn't been climbing in along time." As he takes in what is in front of him a smile starts to comes to his face. "Man I love this job sometimes."
"Ok Red 1 Left flank, Red 2 Right flank. Knights 1 thought 3 go where needed if you get a feeling or whatever you call it let me know." Checking his gear to make sure it is in place. Looking at Awne.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-11-26 19:40:54)

Sgt. Vor'en uses a bit of his tactical mind and realizes a scout would be no good here if they were fumbling up the rocks, any point element must be able to react quickly to initial fire. Vor'en looks over the men and women in his unit.
Sgt. Vor'en: "Anyone who can climb needs to take point, I don't want anyone tripping over their feet and getting shot up."
Awne immediately bounds up in a very feline-like stance. She has no problem advancing up the slippery, rocky incline. As she is moving up, she keeps an eye out for any potential targets.
Red 1 and Red 2 form the flanks at about 15 meters dispersion from Vor'en's command element. Each member steps carefully on the wet rocks, trying cautiously not to roll an ankle or fall. The slope was sitting at about sixty degrees, and it appeared the upward climb led only to steeper terrain. Sgt. Vor'en noted that the slope carried on for a few hundred meters where the cliff cut drastically up. It was here they would have to climb up a bit then traverse around the mountain. Lues had informed the Sergeant that they still had a long distance to travel, but he couldn't be sure exactly how long. The red, wet rock made for a very depressing and miserable atmosphere. This was especially true of a rescue mission.
Meanwhile, while Gor was on left flank, he was carefully observing the surroundings. All he could really see was cliff faces off in the distance. He scanned the top of the elevated areas and could see no figures of anything. He tried to use all of his senses but had a feeling everything was relatively clear from here. He quickly checked his weapon in relation to the acid rain and it seemed to still be fine. He walked over to Dorijidan as he was cumbersomely stepping up the rocks. He took a look at Dor's light repeating blaster and noted that it still looked good. Gor had to be especially careful of the team he was in charge of, as they had already taken enemy contact. He also had to make sure the automatic weapon that Dor was carrying was in prime condition to cover any large targets. They would likely need it to do just that.
Awne continues moving ahead of the element about 30 meters for a good twenty minutes. The slopes were gradually getting steeper and the rocks more difficult to walk on. It seemed the unit still had a large distance to cover. While Awne is bounding up the mountains, she notices her master climbing gracefully next to her.
Feldon: "Awne, what do you think about the imperial walker situation? Your whole thoughts? I didn't really see what was going on until there was firing going on."

### **zerah** (2008-11-26 19:47:53)

Awne steps carefully but quickly, using hands and feet to help her up the mountain more so as it started to get steeper. Her tail waves, and lifts in a curl moving in opposite direction to her movements to aide in balance. A quick pause to look over the others and around, then to Vor'en "alrright down therre Vorr?"
She looks to her master next and chuckles at him before he speaks with a soft teasing "Carreful masterr, you might get dirrty." His words have her thinking back "I find it strrange that they werre herre on the planet. What use is this worrld to them? it's barrrren, looks like it would barrely supporrt life..." she pauses in thought "if they'rre herre...this eitherr makes forr an excellent base point...orr therre's something herre we don't know about yet."

Awne looks around while stretching out with the Force. She could see nothing but desolate mountaintops, orange fog, and rain. If there were any lifeforms out here, she couldn't feel them. However, Awne did feel like she had a good sense of the life around her. The Farghul's master responds to her statement as she looks around.
Feldon: "This planet would be of no use to them anymore. It use to harbor elite Imperial forces back in the days of the Galactic Civil War, and even housed a private fortress that belonged to Darth Vader. Now that conflict with the Imperials has ceased, it would hurt them to be so far away from Imperial space. But, we do know that Mur Eva encountered something here that could pose a threat to the Republic. That is the vague sense that Lues got from her anyways. We're following up on that lead while rescuing our friend. It would be absurd for the Remnant to breach their treaty now, they would have nothing to use against us. I don't think they have the inclination anymore either. There is something else going on out here. Stay alert and stay alive, we'll get to the bottom of this yet."

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-11-26 22:50:30)

While each member of Vor'en's squad traverses and climbs through the terrain, some of them might remember back to their training. They went through similar situations back on one of Coruscant's many training facilities. Long marches, harsh conditions, difficult terrain, remaining stealthy, and fighting the enemy in low numbers is what they were trained to do. Situations like these is what marked a member of SpecForces in the New Republic Defense Force. They had to handle combat arenas that would break most larger units in half. Most units could not climb and walk for miles, and still be able to beat a numerically superior enemy. Each soldier in the unit tried to remember back to their training on Coruscant.
Staff Sgt. Vor'en however, didn't have such great training. The men he led had joined the Republic in a time of relative peace. He was inducted into the Imperial military back when combat was very active. They didn't have much time to train; you joined, learned the basics, then you were thrown to the grinder. When he fought were the times when the Empire was past its prime, and he fought in many losing battles. He had first-hand experience where you learned by trial and error. Error meant you were dead, or you dealt with the death of your comrades. *Each member of the New Republic Army can make a Knowledge Tactics check as a reaction.*

Awne glances to her master as he talks, between climbing. She nods her head "I will masterr..but you have to prromise to stay alive as well." she tries to smile but it comes out pained "Don't know what I'd do without you therre masterr...orr how to handle anotherr death.." she grows quite, pausing longer from her climb to try and collect herself. She had pushed the thought of Hadru to the back of her mind, using the feel of him in the force as a blanket from the pain but thinking of it again so soon was bringing it forward. She breathes deeply and moves forward again pushing the thoughts back.

Listening to what Feldon was telling Awne about what was here before the planet lost his usefullness to the Reminate. "Vader was a bit before my time. Was in the 501st, when I got out of training the Reminate in retreat, servived under Thrawn and the Empire of the Hand. After that I was Special Forces untill that time when I had the trouble with my Commanding Officer. that was a mess." Vor'en doesn't like talking about his past, most of it was history now.

He had never really moved through mountains before, or traveled in such low numbers. He might have to ask his own men,who happened to be trained as Pathfinders, for a few pointers. One thing was certain, Vor'en had more time being shot at than these guys probably had training time.
As he's pondering and climbing, his comlink chirps. He orders his men to a security halt and to cover in a 360 degree area of their position.
Sierra Main: "Red Seven, I've analyzed everything I could on the walker. Nothing on board seemed to have any Imperial affiliation. Furthermore, it seems the people operating the walker were very underequipped, minus the walker. They had very shabby clothing and rusty weaponry. The walker itself was in bad condition.

"This is going to make things alittle more interesting. This enemy is going to be unpredicable at best." "If you get anymore intel Sierra 1 it would helpfull."

I doubt Falsoor has anything to do with it, though we do know about them having illegal military grade weaponry. It was never documented they possessed vehicles of this type. It is raising more questions. Remember your objectives, rescue and recon. Anything you find on this planet has substantial intelligence value. Don't hesitate to call the slightest thing in. If you run into more trouble, remember the SOP, hit-and-run. Make the enemy unsure of your numbers. I'll look more into the walker, and continue working on the ship.

Aymaric's mind had been dwelling this whole time on the facility he watched be destroyed. He hadn't really talked to the group about it, but he was glad he ran into people with weapons, this planet had become more dangerous than it already was. He figured if he was going to tell somebody more about it, it would almost be time. They were close to the direction to where the experimental colony was. If they headed due south they would definitely find it. While he is thinking of this, he walks to each member of the position and noticed that Vor'en and Awne had some slight injuries. A few cuts and burns, nothing major, they would benefit from some more medical attention though.

Gor kept walking along with his team, keeping his eyes open, but the rain was making it harder for him to see anything. He wasnÂ´t overly worried though, he usually got out alright. He couldnÂ´t tell why, but there was something in the back of his head that made the fur on his neck stand if something was about to go wrong.
He knew well enough to trust in this feeling, it had been proven right before.

Staff Sergeant Vo'ren gives the order for his squad to begin traversing up the mountain again. Lues was still navigating next to the Sergeant, keeping the formation pointed in the right heading. It seemed they still had a good distance to cover. Sgt. Vor'en estimated they were still on track to get the mission done with time to spare. They had close to two days to find Mur Eva and gather what info they could about threats and Falsoor.
Red Team had encountered Falsoor before, and he can only remember one incident about their corruption. He thinks back to the time they went to Nar Shaddaa to handle Bordo the Hutt who had been troubling Mos Esre. The Jedi and Red Team had speculated that Falsoor might of been receiving resources from Bordo, but they had no solid evidence to prove it. So when they found a Falsoor facility on Nar Shaddaa, their speculations were proven to a degree because they possessed illegal-military grade weaponry. Master Lorhas had been working on this case for a while, but only recently after all these years have they had the time to take action. Red Team and the Jedi had been through so much. They had saved precious Republic personnel, had their friends trained as Jedi, saved a big portion of Kashyyyk, defended a Republic base on Bakura, and investigated the seemingly charitable Falsoor. Vor'en continued the march uphill with much on his mind, most notably the safety of his comrades.

After his medical assessment of the group, Aymaric moves over to the one wounded by the mine and offers assistance. Extending his hand in a gesture of greeting, "Hello, I don't think we were properly introduced. My name is Aymaric, former medical student at Coruscant University, former Republic Medic, and current I think, Falsoor employee." Waiting a short pause for a reaction he continues on, "I wanted to offer my condolences for the loss of your teammate earlier, and to offer medical assistance for you injuries."

Awne looks over to the human, looking him over carefully. She didn't trust him, not yet, and really she had no reason to; however the condolences were kind if she didn't think he was only doing it for some other reason. The death of her friend had certainly done a number to her trust, making her pull away to those that she knew well and knew Hadru as well as she did.
A glance to her belt and a hand to open the pouch where the madpacks had once been "I have none." she says simply "and my masterr has alrready helped me." She really didn't mean to sound cold or uncaring, truly she didn't, it was only her nature to pull away from others to deal with a loss; especially when being forced to deal with it quicker than she wished.
A brief subtle nod ment for the human she knew was watching after his communication to her had her thinking of something to ask the other. Her tail twitches, the acid rain was becoming annoying "you have no medpacks?" it was a lame way to keep him near her, but it was all she could come up with.

After about ten minutes of walking up steep ground and rocks, Awne looks back to the formation and sees that everyone had gotten slightly winded. From here on out, the movement was pretty much a climb upwards. Awne figured it was time for a break and that Vor'en did want the group to stop so he could ask Aymaric some questions. Sgt. Vor'en gives the order for all his men to halt and cover 360 degrees of the area around the unit. Now was the time to ask Aymaric some questions before everyone got really exhausted from climbing.

"Direct questioning, no fluff, very Military, I like that sergeant." A slight smile creases Aymaric's mouth, he really did miss the Republic Army.
"Hmm...to be honest I no longer know what will be at the facility. The walker we ran into earlier was definately not part of the regular equipment the security force had. That may be part of the force that invaded us with droids." The Falsoor employee takes a quick moment to contemplate a bit, then continues.
"If you change your route a little and head south you will come across a series of shallow ravines that will lead you to an old wharehouse complex, if it's still there."
"That's about all the reliable information I got Sergeant, except that if you don't get your people out of this rain soon, they won't be any good to you." Aymaric stands and waits for a response. "By the way Sergeant, do you have any spare equipment I could use?"

*To build a shelter to protect everyone from the rain, it will require a survival check. Aymaric gains 100 xp for the knowledge check.*
Aymaric tries to remember what he might know about Vjun. He can't really explain the acid rain, and all the stories he heard about this planet is that it was rich in the Dark Side. A very wealthy family used to reside here and it was known that the only race that lived here was humans. They immigrated here at one point in time. The acid rain was known to be concentrated and harmful if someone was exposed to it for too long.
Staff Sergeant Vo'ren realizes that Aymaric knew quite a bit about Falsoor, and that he knew where one of their facilities had been. Vo'ren remembered that his second objective on the mission was to recon any intel he could about Falsoor, and to find out what they were doing there and why. If Aymaric did know the location of a Falsoor facility, it might be helpful to the mission to take a look.

"So the walker was not part of the security force that Falsor had on planet. It was part of the invadtion force. How long ago was this invadtion?" What little info that Vor'en had about this lovely vacation spot was limited and he had used the one source that he had and he while not a wealth of information had given them more then they had. He looks over at Lues and Awne to see if they had any thoughts, or if they thought he might be holding something back.

"Sure thing Sergeant.." Aymaric takes the datapad and looks it over, after a couple minutes he shows it to Sergeant Vor'en. "I marked the wharehouses here...and this route through these shallow ravines are sensor blind spots. I was told it had something to do with the minerals in the hillsides." Aymaric hands the datapad back to Vor'en.
"Taking this route to the wharehouses and taking a moment to regroup, will keep your team and equipment from succumbing to the corrosive effects of the acid rain, it will also get you closer to the main facility, which is where I assume you are going." Speaking in a lower voice so only Vor'en can hear, "Sergeant your team won't last much longer out here, even the Jedi. My cloak is the only reason I survived out here."
Speaking agin in a normal tone, "As far as the equipment Falsoor had here for the security force...you actually are more heavily equiped than we were. Other than a few ground cars and some heavy construction vehicles, we had nothing like the walker. We also didn't put any minefields out here. Falsoor's intentions here were purely scientific."

They were definitely not using an Imperial code and the Z-95's said that it was imperative that they stole the freighter in orbit. They must of been talking about our ship.

Sierra Main: "Roger that Red Seven, it sounds good. You won't be any good to Knight 4 (Mur Eva) with damaged equipment. You might be able to gather intel at that location. If I can get a bit more repair work done on the *Starshade* I might be able to scout the location before you get there if it's not too surrounded by rock. Sierra Main out."
Lues responds to Vo'ren. Feldon hands Awne some syntherope for the climb.
Lues: "I agree with you, we need shelter from this storm or we won't be in any shape to help Mur Eva. I sense that she is doing ok for the moment."
The formation stands and begins moving toward the cliff face. Awne begins a free climb straight up on the slippery rock face. She wonders if the rest of the group could handle this climb. She takes her time and expertly climbs up the intermediate difficulty mountainside. As she is looking up, one paw after the other, the rain burns her eyes. She blinks quickly and focuses her effort to get up the wall. Awne gets atop a medium-sized platform and ties the syntherope so the rest of the squad can get up the rock face with ease. They continue to use the method of Awne climbing on point and roping the rest of the team up. After about 10 minutes of rigorous climbing, the face evens out to a walkable angle.
Red Team had finally gotten atop the small cliff. They could observe down into the downgrade of the mountains to see a valley of ravines and jutted rock. The sky was as dark and orange as when they had gotten here, now just partially being lit up by lighting here and there. Aymaric motioned to one of the ravines at the bottom of the mountain to the south. That is where the map indicated the experimental colony was close to. They would have to cross the rocky ravine and go to the top of a plateau to get there. After about 45 minutes of crossing the treacherous terrain, the ground evens out back into sand/mud and Awne can see the city about one kilometer away. Now was an ideal time to do any checks before heading into the colony. This area was relatively flat and you could see that you had gotten out of one particular mountain range and were now on top of a plateau.
The *Starshade* glides overhead as everyone observes it approach the small colony. A torrent of turbolaser fire emits from somewhere inside the colony that you couldn't see from here and slams the freighter. It begins smoking and it immediately withdraws.
Sierra Main: "Red Seven that colony has its anti-air defenses online! I have to get away from this area. Proceed into that area with caution!"
Aymaric knew that there were turbolaser turrets set up across the colony, but he had also knew that they were not setup to target just anybody. It was possible that the battle droids that attacked the city might have reprogrammed them. He wondered if anyone he knew that lived there was still alive. There were even the employees families staying there.

A trapezoid shaped bulk transport is seen flying from the south. It was about 125 meters long and it had a metallic/brown color to it. The ship seems to be going slow as if it was hitting a landing pattern. Aymaric recognized that cargo ship, he knew the pilot by name. The ship was called *Broken Dream*. It was probably doing another cargo run. The transport disappears from sight as it lands in the city.

Sgt. Vor'en orders the unit to move out. He has Awne take point and his two teams flank the unit. The area they were crossing was wide open but there were more mountain ranges to the east and west. Red Team slowly but surely executes the patrol across the 1 kilometer distance to the city.
Lues looks over to Sgt. Vor'en.
Lues: "I sense nothing but death here."
Lorhas: "As do I, the Dark Side is strong in this city. It's difficult to see anything other than death. I sense a presence we haven't felt in a long time."
Sgt. Vor'en *+5 Perception Formation bonus* carefully examines the city, there didn't seem to be any defense walls surrounding the city. It was an open area that anybody could walk into. He did notice the turbolaser towers though, he could seem two of them here on the corners of the colony.
After a good twenty minute walk, you step foot into the colony. The ground was paved duracrete that was basically a gigantic panel for the whole colony to sit on. The buildings were thick and wide, but lacked height. They had a crude design to them, as if they were in the process of being refined. They were generally a mass of parts of black and red that lacked coverings. Most buildings didn't seem to go higher than 3 or 4 stories. The buildings seemed mostly intact but had significant damage to their structure. Blaster holes and impact craters proved that small arms and grenades were at work here. Fires were littered throughout the area and it seemed the place had just recently endured a battle. Wrecked speeders were common along the duracrete roads. A few dead human bodies were scattered throughout as well. Nobody seemed to be alive here. It was as if some people left, and those who couldn't get away were killed.
Vor'en analyzed the situation tactically, and realized that someone did attack yesterday. This was confirmed by Aymaric. Vor'en thought the worse case scenario is that if someone came back to clear the area up and they would be caught in the middle.
Aymaric knew this area well, they were just passing the north security building on their right. You had to be checked in by Falsoor before leaving the colony or coming back. A cantina was on the left, they typically had a very low selection, but you could score spice there if you knew the right people. If Vor'en wanted directions to anywhere specific, Aymaric was the one to ask, as it was possible to get lost in this colony.
In terms of intelligence, there were a lot of places Sgt. Vor'en could begin to look. Did he want to do that? Or get his men in shelter first?

Even though the acid rain had began to effect him, he single mindedly wanted to continue on to find her. However, he could tell everyone needed a respite from the weather. The quicker the team got that respite the quicker they could continue on.

"This place has seen a one hell of a fight. Alot of small arms fire and gernades. Nothing big as far as I can tell. Must have been the security force and someone else. You said Battle Driods attacked but no one has really used them in mass for sometime. Where did they come from."
Vor'en realizes that they need to keep moving and starts to move in the direction that Aymaric showed them. "Ok squad cover formation. Red 1 left, Red 2 right and rear guard.

Aymaric: "That's the cantina, we should be safe there and it might have some foodstuffs left in it. We can rest there and you don't have to cut into your rations. There should also be refreshers and a few beds to recuperate."
The formation sets up security on corners and cover around the buildings. Aymaric goes up to the durasteel door and types in the door panel. It makes an error sound.

The sealed door opens up with a hiss and Vor'en scans the area as all his troops walk in. They finally had shelter from the rain. The cantina was a moderate size. It had a holoscreen opposite the door across the room that was displaying various sports that no one knew what they were. The actual bar was in the far right corner, and there was a stairwell next to the door. The music was going really slow and erroneous, as if their was a malfunction with the sound system. An eerie red light was cast across the entire bar that gave a blood-like sheen to the room. It was emergency lighting.
There were durable tables spread out across the polished, smooth black floor. Some of the tables seemed to be dejarik tables. The area seemed quite safe, it was quiet besides the music. The intense rain could be heard beating on the rooftop. It was like you were in a ghost town now.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything about the colony on the datapad. It was likely Falsoor wanted to keep this place anonymous. Although Vor'en wasn't sure of this. The soldier looks behind the bar and finds many plasteel boxes stacked together on the bar shelves. He opens them and finds that they have a big stockpile of some kind of wings. It was probably the cantina's primary source of food. It looked like they needed to be cooked, otherwise they looked delicious. He could also find multiple bottles of different kinds of alcohol. There was a cooking station set up behind the bar as well, and a compartment to keep the drinks cool. Everything seemed like it was left in a hurry.
Vor'en's comlink chirps to life in response to his statement.

Hadru was gone, the rain was burning her wounds that were still healing and her fur had started to let the rain move to her skin. She was tired, sad, generally..she just wasn't feeling herself and the dark blanket over everything wasn't helping.
The Cantina was a welcome respite from the rain, though once the rain wasn't on her anymore of course made it all too apparent the damage it had started to do. She sighs down to the burns and her wounds though ignores them as she steps further into the room. Her tail was low, near dragging along the floor; she may try to put on the uncaring face, her tail had always been her weak spot with emotion. A glance over to the Jedi's, one in particular had her sighing again and trying to shake the memories, emotions, and the overwhelming sadness from her. Instead she moves to the stairs slowly looking down the hall and to the rooms, drawing her blaster just in case.

"I'll have some mystery wings, Master," the wookiee says, realizng he hadn't eaten in a while. He would be no help to Mur Eva in a weakened state.
Woroken steps behind the bar, and begins rummaging through the alcohol bottles the Sergeant had pointed out earlier. "Anyone care for a stiff drink?" he asks pointing to a bottle he picked up, just in case anyone didn't fully understand his meaning. He placed a fine looking bottle on the counter, grabbed a fistful of glasses, and poured a few ounces in each glass, offering them to everyone close by.

"Well now there is best news I have heard all day. A drink would be great right now." Vor'en looks at the bottles trying to figure out what some of them might be. "Back in the good old days, When I was younger and less battle worn, we would have landed in mass and just stubbled around until we found what we where looking for. No quite little insertion. That was the Reminates stile then. That and lossing battle after battle. Incase you are wondering yes I fought against the New Republic when it was frist created. I was under Thrawn when he took over. Until I wised up of course." Pouring some of the liquid he had found behind the bar that might have wiskey of some sort in to a glass he slams it down and savores the burning effect.
Walking over to the bar and picking up his gear he walks over to a table and begins his equipment check. Removing the blaster pack he starts to check the weapon over for damage from the rain. "Lues, do you have any idea how far we are from where she is, distance wise. I realize it is not that perises, but an idea would be nice. Oh and we are going to have to figure out if we can find anymore info about this place map something that will at least we can use incase we get seperated from one another." Vor'en pulls out a cleaning kit and continues to work on his weapons.

Xander has been running on autopilot since the death of his friend. He joins Vor'en at the bar and motions for him to pass him the bottle. He takes a swig and hands it back.
"So whats the plan Sarge?"
He then begins to clean the acid rain out of his armor and puts a coat of oil on it to help protect it.

Moving along with Dor, GorÂ´Ak searches the building, and upon finding a good window with a clear wiew over a lot of the open area around the cantina, he instructs Dor to take position there, keeping watch and providing sniper cover in case of a fight. Personally, he preferred combat over short distances, and decided to take up a position to defend the entrance. And so, he went down to the bar, where he found a few of the other in the group as well. Putting one of his pistols in front of him, he sat down at one of the tables.
"Nice place we found here. Sure beats being out in that dreadful rain"

The Jedi Knight Feldon takes the wings and begins cooking them in the burner. He figured a little treat might help to get everyone's morale up, and since he didn't have any other task, it was perfect job for him as he always did seem to become caretaker. He was especially concerned with his Padawan, this was the Farghul's first time as apprentice that she really had to endure the harshness of reality. The small wings were done cooking quickly, and he began handing them out to the rest of the team.
Awne was looking upstairs. Up here, there was a small hallway with three rooms. She quickly searches each room to find that they had a bed, transparisteel windows, drawer, and a refresher. It seems this cantina had a place for its patrons to get some rest. There was nobody left in the cantina however. After she's done with the 3rd room, she runs into her master with a plate in of steaming food in her face. He also has a glass of water.
Feldon: "Here, eat this...and calm down."
He says this with a smile, the Jedi certainly looked too young to be fighting battles out here.
Sergeant Vor'en was downstairs checking his equipment. It seemed fine as far as he could tell, and it would definitely function when he needed it. He cleaned up the E-11 and made sure the blaster pack was still firmly locked and loaded. Lues had been talking with him about the distance to Mur Eva.
Lues: "Well, I can't give you a definite answer, but she's a good couple of miles away. She's somewhere in the mountains, and it will definitely feel a lot longer than a few miles. Mur Eva's extremely resilient, she will tough her way through any situation. As far as information about this place, might want to link up with a terminal. I saw one out in the square we were in. A general information terminal should have a map."
Lues passes his plate of wings and offers them to the Sergeant.
Gor' Ak has his teammate set up on a viewport in one of the bedrooms. Not long after he's in position, Dorijidan calls for Gor' Ak. Gor' Ak looks out the window to see someone walking in the square they were just in. The person was wearing a gray jumpsuit and was alone. It was a human male, he was about 35 meters away and he was unaware of Gor. He had a blaster pistol drawn and he looked nervous.
*You failed the knowledge check. Everyone has been served food and drink by Feldon.*

Xander finishes his maintenance and over hears "Lues" talking about a dataterm outside.
"Voren Im gonna go check the terminal outside. I will keep comms open."
Xander puts his helmet on and grabs his rifle and heads for the door. He looks around for the terminal.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-12-02 19:01:12)

Xander walks outside and hears the rain thumping harmlessly off his armor. He spots the terminal quickly in the corner off the North Checkpoint building. He also catches a human male blue and green eyes clad in a gray pilot jumpsuit. He has wind-swept strawberry blonde hair and looks quite young, as if he was in his mid-twenties. He had a fancy blaster in his hand that was being held at the alert position. The man shouts at the armor-clad scout.
Man: "Who goes there?!"

Coming down from DorÂ´s sniper position, Gor checsk the power pack of his blaster before turning to the others gathered in the bar.
"WeÂ´ve got company. ItÂ´s only one guy, but he seems a little edgy and has a gun. I donÂ´t think heÂ´s a threat, but there might be more coming. Should I bring him in Sarge?"

Gor quickly notices that Xander was already outside.

## Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-02 19:10:39)

After a quick survey, Gor realized that Xander wasnÂ´t among the others. Wrapping his cloak tight aroung him, and keeping his blaster folded inside it, he swiftly moves outside. He keeps close to the house wall, just as much to avoid being seen, as to keep himself out of the rain.
He starts to move in the direction of where he had seen the man, all the while trying to stay hidden, as well as to spot anything else moving. He clicks his comlink twice to Dor, to let the other know that he should be on alert with the rifle.

## Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-12-02 19:19:26)

Xander quickly glances at the weapon the man was carrying. It was a WESTAR-34 blaster pistol of silver and dallorian alloy. It was specifically designed for close-range battle and it likely packed a punch in close quarters. Someone who was wealthy would likely carry such a pistol. *Xander gains 100 experience for the check.*

Gor stealthfully moves outside *Stealth rating 13* and spots the man in a confrontation with Xander. He hugs the wall and it seems the man hasn't seen Gor' Ak. All his attention was on Xander. The man responds to Xander.

Xander looks throughout the roads, alleys, and buildings close to Radon. He couldn't see anyone else around. He was certain he was searching good too. Radon keeps his pistol up as he talks.

Awne starts at the sudden appearance of her master, wondering for a minute how he had been able to sneak up on her with a plate of food. She sighs and gives him a small smile, taking the plate and drink and moving to a bed to sit. Placing the drink on the floor and the plate in her lap, only to simply stare at the wings. She couldn't help thinking she'd failed, not just Hadru, but her master as well.

## Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-02 19:34:37)

Certain that he wasnÂ´t seen, Gor sticks close to the wall, observing Xander and the unknown man. He didnÂ´t appear to be a soldier, and Xander was a big boy. Pulling out his sporting blaster, in case he had to do some short range sniping, he scanned the area for anything moving other than Xander and the man. He also tried to asses wether Dor would have a clear shot at the stranger from his hideout or not.

## Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-12-02 19:39:53)

Gor could not see anything from his position of any kind of movement. He could see the whole square between two buildings, the security building, and the bar. Xander and Radon were standing in the middle of the square, and Dor's observation point gave him clear line of sight to those two.

Lues Van: "Yes, I know. Those were troubling times. I was dealing with something internally I couldn't explain, and it still haunts me to this day. But I've been able to handle it a lot better since I've gotten some control over the Force. I was somebody back then I didn't really know, thank the Force I was able to get some of memory back."
While he's speaking, the durasteel door hisses open. There he stood, Radon Antila, after all these years. No one had seen him since Mos Esre. Age hadn't really affected him much, although it seemed his face had been reconstructed a bit. Radon seemed shocked as he looked at the group, it was obvious he recognized everyone. Apparently Xander had taken his weapon away from him.
Radon: "You guys...what are you doing on this barren planet? You don't work for Falsoor."
Radon's eyes glance over to Lues and they lock with anger. His tone dramatically changes. Radon knew him as Rith.

She moves down the stairs, plate and glass in hand she makes to go to the bar but stops and stares at the man walking in "Rradon??"

"So your the pilot that was fly the transport we saw earlyer. I guess we need your services, and if they think of ratting us out I will hunt you down a slot you myself.

Considering I did **nothing** against you and Rith straight up attacked me for a horrible reason. You all let it be swept under the rug like it was nothing. I was almost KILLED! I don't want anything from the likes of you. Rith killed my dream! My career was destroyed after that injury! I lost everything. Now I fly cargo ships for Falsoor. I came to you under good graces and I'll get for my troubles is a career-ending injury, and no justice from "supposedly" good people. None of you care!

" I am sorry for what happened to you back then, but you could stop whinning about it and moved on. Putting around in Rith would not have helped in the least.

He's been with us through everything, we've all taken turns saving each others lives since the beginning. Does that not mean anything? With due time, we'll get to the bottom of Lues' condition. But has he did anything wrong since he said he recovered some memory? No, we've all been doing the same thing."

Please understand, that we believe we're onto something about Lues that is beyond his control. We believe there is a relation between that and Awne's attack on Vor'en.

Being in the unique position of security team medic, Aymaric had knowledge of those hidden places that only the higher ups knew of. These were panic rooms, safe houses, secret storage rooms, used when there was enough warning to get to them and secure yourself from an overwelming force, to wait for help. But the attack that came on the heels of the insanity which overcame the employees of the facility was quick and brutal. No warning sirens were heeded because they were already going off. The reality of the attacks hit the young medic hard, as soon as he was close enough to see the aftermath of the two attacks.
The anger and frustration, the sadness and self pity, welled up inside Aymaric, and threatened to strip away who he was and bring him to a place of insanity.
But all the emotions subsided when, autopiloting the group to the edge of the facility, he saw his salvation. The place where he frequently went to murder his boredom and make a little extra money off of....expired...boredom remedies, the "Test Tube" cantina.
The particular "safe room" of this building, secreted behind one of the lavatory stalls so a casual observer couldn't see it, was meant to be a small stoarge room. It was to be accessed in minor emergencies, holding rations, a small supply of medpacs and carry litters. But the entrepenurial medic made more frequent and better use of it. He stored high grade liquor and spare "remedies" in here, as well as other random things he felt no one should know he had. This is where he was when the new comer came into the cantina. Aymaric had come out of the restroom, slightly upset because someone had found and ransacked his little fortune closet, when he noticed the newcomer, a newcomer who wasn't so new to him.
He quickly, but as quietly as possible, tries to hide in a darkened corner to listen to the conversation going on between his new companions and this old aquaintance.

Lues Van: "Yes Awne?"
Aymaric tries to stay out of sight in the corner of the bar, however its apparent that Radon has seen him. He kind of looks at him funny.

"Well at least the tention is cut in here alittle. So what we need is a lay out of the colony and an idea of the defence other then the turbo laser batterys around the area. Any other information would be great also." Vor'en notices that Lues had left the room, heading for the up stairs. He will have to deal with Lues sometime might as well after this.
Vor'en fishes around in his pocket for a cigar and hopes that it isn't ruined from the rain. Finding one and lighting it he settles in to listen to what Radon has to say. Pulling up the planet map on his datapad and going over what he allready knows has happened.

Radon gestures toward Sgt. Vor'en to have a seat at his table.
Radon: "Ok, I'll tell you what I know, but I can use a drink."
Feldon promptly pours some stout alcohol in a glass and hands it to Radon who was sitting at a table by himself.
Radon: "Well, I was on a typical cargo mission from Telares station to here. Once I got out of hyperspace, I noticed that P-57 was in a state of alert. I tried to communicate with the Docking Bay command but no one was transmitting. I decided to land anyways. Protocol dictates that in a state of alert no ships are allowed in unless your of Falsoor affiliation. Therefore, if you don't have the security code you won't be able to land without the four turbolaser turrets blowing you away. I entered the code and landed way southeast in the city, were the docking bay is located. Turns out everyone who lived and worked here has been killed. There was about five hundred people total that lived here. Strange thing is, it doesn't seem all the bodies are here. So some of them must of escaped. I don't know why the alert has been called or what has happened. When I couldn't figure out what was going on I told my crew to stay with the ship and that I would have a look around. Then I ran into you. The thing is, I don't know what's going on here because I don't stay here long. I usually don't visit this place except every 3 weeks."
Radon takes a sip from his mug.
Radon: "I can get you a map of this area easy, and just what in the hell are you guys doing on sector P-57?"

But they'd have to be pretty resourceful to find this place. Pirates usually aren't that slick. A crime lord maybe? Although I doubt straight up attack would be there style. It just doesn't add up."
Radon takes a pause to sip from his drink, he winces as the strong drink goes down his throat.
Radon: "Mainly research goes on here. I know Falsoor was trying to make advances to its relationship around the galaxy. They wanted their opinion of them to be great. You see, most planets don't really trust this organization when it comes to its rebuilding efforts. They think its a small name group that can't handle the big stuff. So in an effort to prove themselves, they made sector P-57. It's a colony designed to actually bring life and greenery to Vjun. We are using state-of-the-art atmospheric processors and greenhouse buildings to simulate life of a lush planet like Naboo. Once a suitable area of land was found next to P-57, the process of developing a stable biosphere would occur. Falsoor figures if they could bring life to this rock that any place would accept them for business. Although, some lesser prestige planets have already added Falsoor to their payroll to rebuild their environment.
The project here seemed to be going extremely slow, as if progress hadn't been made in three years. No one who works for Falsoor seems to care though, as they are getting decent paychecks."

He takes a swig from a bottle phad with him when he came out of the bathroom. "Ya, Radon's right, on all accounts as far as I can tell. Falsoor seemed to be legit as far as this planet went. I didn't come across any oddities or unusual activities while on patrol as the security medic."

"So basically this is a big public relations tool for the company. They can fix this planet they can do anything. But the pilots we ran into in orbit wanted out of here bad.

Radon and his crew of 20 frequently made stops in hangar bay 3 where Aymaric had worked security. It was an important job as the contents usually dropped off where very sensitive. Radon had been known to deliver precious cargo every time he came into the system. Radon had an aura kind of like a sports-jockey though. This is what Aymaric could remember.
The former podracer smiles at Vor'en as he finishes his drink.
Radon: "Yea, it's a public relations tool. They want to increase their reputation with this project. It just doesn't seem like they were getting it done. I don't anything about any attackers you might have faced. Next to no one inhabits Vjun. Well, if you don't count the insane humans who wander the planet. I doubt they could operate starships though.

The comment about the insane humans brought back memories of the first crisis that occured here at the facility. He couldn't remember dealing with any others outside the facility, maybe he was already insane and didn't know it? The trauma of the last few days must have seriously messed with his head, he will have to double check the storage room agin, hopefully he missed something the first time. As he gets up to walk back to the restroom, he remembers a question he had for Radon. "Other humans, we never ran into any while I was here. Granted, I haven't been here as long as some had been.But I think we would have been warned about other humans. And insane, what makes you call them insane?"

Still out of sight, Gor watched Xander and the other man walk together into the cantina, the other apparently not interested in hurting them. As he looked around, he couldnÂ´t see anything moving around the colony, but he decided to take a wider sweep, just to make sure.
He began moving around between the buildings, all the while keeping to the walls, scanning around himself, watching and listening. Hopefully, the other man had come alone, but he wasnÂ´t about to trust fate just yet, not with all the trouble theyÂ´d had on this planet.

The bottle Aymaric was drinking of happened to be Hothan Ice, the bite of the alcohol actually blended with the extreme coolness of the drink.
Radon: "I have no idea about that part, that's why I got out of my cargo transport to check things out. I haven't been here in three weeks. What have you seen?"
Vor'en's helmet comlink chirps after about 5 minutes.
Sierra Main: "Red Seven, what's your SITREP?"
Gor 'Ak began sweeping the entire colony. He went west first, past the Cantina and the Northern security checkpoint building. He noticed the western section of the colony seemed to be a residential area. It seemed to have recreational facilities such as playgrounds for kids sitting in the "front yard." These buildings seemed to hold much more than one family at a time, and they seemed of nicer construction than the other buildings he saw in the north. They had a grey/silver design and were of very sharp rectangular design. As if it was an official place to live. There were just dead bodies here and there on the ground. Some of them were women and children. They were either charred or dead from blaster fire. He traveled about 150 meters then took the south pathway that led around the residential area. He couldn't see anything worth investigating here. He also noticed the rain wasn't slowing down and daylight was slowly going away.
Now he seemed to be getting to the lab/research area. Many of the buildings here seemed crude, and had generators or storage facilities coupled with them. Some of them had exhaust vents with smog filtering out that you had no idea what it was. There were a few dome shaped facilities that seemed to be artificial natural habitats. Many hovering cargo lifts and speeders were laid out in destruction across the duracrete road. A lot of silver cargo bins were sprawled out across the paved ground next to the wrecked vehicles. He noticed a large building ahead with a gray exterior with multiple viewports that were dark spread out across the front of the building. It seemed to a nice-looking facility and it had a sign that said "P-57 HQ". It was likely the base of operations. He begin walking towards it searching the research area. Like the residential area, there seemed to be a few dead people here and there who had Falsoor uniforms. He keeps using cover and proceeds through the pathways between the research buildings to round out his sweep of the south side. He begins walking across the long front of the HQ. As he is about 30 meters away from it, a tremendous force strikes his knee. He feels a burning sensation as if he had been hit by a blaster bolt, although he didn't hear or see anything. He could still walk ok. *Gor 'Ak has taken 13 damage, you are now at 17 HP. You are still fine on the condition track.*
 *Gor 'Ak you had a stealth rating 28 with the camo and everything. However at least one target has spotted you. You are now in combat, however you can't see the target. Cover around you would be two wrecked speeders that are about 12 squares away to your right and 26 squares behind you. There are some cargo crates that don't provide full-cover all around.*

Woroken scanned the immediate area on the outside, but could see nothing going on. He saw the typical dead humans in the area. The Wookiee also saw the normal 1-2 story buildings around the square. There was no activity in either of them. It looks as if Gor had traveled a good distance away from the unit, although you can't see very far past the buildings. Judging from here, he would of have to of gotten at least 100 meters to get out of eye sight. There must be a few buildings between him and Gor.

Awne had paused at the typical saying of the Jedi, it wasn't what she wanted to hear and only made her heart sink. She was a fool to think that anything would have stayed the same when he got his memories back, and she told herself over and over now. Reaching the bottom of the stairs she stays to the wall, barely listening to the others talk as her mind was too busy berating the rest of her on even remotely hoping that he'd somehow come to his senses that she needed to know he still at least liked her more than a friend, he was a Jedi Knight and that was that, end of story, the end. He moved on, she'd have to do the same or risk continuous pining for him; and she'd be damned if she let that happen. *Neverr should have fell forr him…* she thinks.
Lorhas's words cut through her thoughts, and she was off running after Woro. Looking around the area, she tries to see where the other soldier might have gone to first, even tipping her nose to the air in the hopes maybe *something* would be strong enough for her to smell.

*Initiative count: Enemy 24, Gor 'Ak 21. Surprise round ends, the enemy gets another attack on you during normal combat.*
Gor 'Ak takes a second shot to his other knee and feels a sharp pain shoot up through his leg. Gor was unable to spot the enemy, he couldn't even see the projectile hitting him. He was communicating with his Sergeant trying to let him know what's going on while simultaneously looking northwest in the direction from which he traveled. Red 1 would have to proceed through the residential area back to the northern section where the cantina was.
*You are knocked down to 2 hp and -1 on the condition track, second wind brings you up to 15 and you have the def bonus. You move 6 squares back to the north.*
Back in the square, Xander noticed plenty of spots to get a good vantage point from. However, he wasn't sure from here if the other buildings would block his sight of Gor or not. He also wasn't sure what direction to look unless he was actually using his comlink to home in on him. An elevated point could be advantageous, if he knew where to look. It was a decision he would have to make quickly.
Awne watched as Vor'en's squad was assembling outside the "Test Tube" with speed. Theos, Lance, and Dor do a quick weapons check with Vor'en. They nod to Woro, Awne, and Xander that they were moving out in a hurry. Master Lorhas acknowledges to watch Radon and the cantina while they were gone.
Sgt. Vor'en gets a lead on Gor's comlink signal and directs the formation to face to the south by southwest. They would be cutting through a lot of alleys and back areas. He figured Xander was going to scout elswhere. Dorijidan was taking point with 15 meters dispersion to the center group which was Awne, Woro, and Vor'en. The rear guard was Lance; flank security was Theos and Awne.
Awne concentrated through the Force and realized that the comlink signal was pointing her in the same direction as her power. She felt Gor, and he was going through immense pain. He was taking action though, he had fight left in him. She had no doubt she cleared her mind enough to get the group to Gor.
After about 45 seconds total, the group was sprinting down the alleys of sector P-57 to get to Red 1.

Xander watches as the squad darts through the buildings to the south. He approaches the first building that was about two stories high they passed on their left. The building was small but it looked sturdy. It looked like a storage building of some type. He jet packed a short distance and landed on its durasteel roof. This roof had no sidings so he crouched low. Quite a few buildings from the south were blocking his vision, but he could see nothing but speeder roads, alleys, dead bodies, wrecked speeders, and other buildings. The rain continued to pour making it slightly difficult to walk on the roof. About 300 meters to the south, he could see the top of one of the biggest buildings. It had multiple viewports covering the front of it and was about 10 stories high. It was also very wide and thick. Its exterior was silver with gray trim and it
looked like a headquarters building. Judging by his comlink signal it would take at least 150-200 meters to see Gor 'Ak. He would have to pack from roof to roof.

*Tactics check as a reaction. 100 XP for Xander.* Xander's thoughts are confirmed, one of the tallest buildings in P-57 would make a great area to shoot someone from. Guessing from the fact that there isn't a large enemy force present, and Gor didn't see who shot him. It was a safe bet there was a sniper somewhere covering an avenue of approach. Xander couldn't see the ground area of approach that the fancy building was covering, but if it was a speeder road or what not that would be perfect. He scans the front of the building along with each viewport, the front door, pillars, and other cover areas. He could see nothing around the building that would be a threat.

*Gor takes six damage from exposure to the harsh acid rain.*
As Gor 'Ak is running to the North, a third impact can be felt on his right shin. The blast entered from his calf and shattered his shin. Gor collapses instantly and is incapable of doing anything. The cold duracrete ground hurt his leg as he slapped the floor hard. Blood was pouring out of his right leg, torn pants, and mangled skin/bone. He managed to fling his rifle at least 5 meters out of reach. Gor laid prone on his back, and still could not see the attacker. He was in a great amount of pain in his legs, but he didn't feel like he was going to die. He was holding consciousness in an effort to see his comrades arrive. *Successful con check.* He felt the rain sting his face as he awaited whatever was going to happen next, as he was powerless to do anything. *You are 0 hp but you are not dying. Someone has specifically targeted your limbs to immobilize you. You are -5 on the condition track and can only talk very softly. You are too weak to put up any kind of fight. You are a helpless target. Combat has ended.*

Aymaric was hot on the tail of Awne, he finally got her name from conversation he overheard. Thankful that the person or persons who found and raided his little stash, had left his medical equipment behind. He wasn't sure what was going on, but when a Jedi perks up and runs off like a well trained guard dog, you gotta follow.

Adric Ven, dressed in his armored metallic green jacket and black uniform, ran to the corner of a building and peered around the corner. His palms were sweating and his adrenaline was pumping. If he were younger, Ven might actually be enjoying himself.
The sounds of combat had called him towards the area.
*â€œGreat, first Battle Droids and now thisâ€* Ven thought to himself as he slid his heavy blaster pistol from its holster.
Ven didnâ€™t come to Vjun to get blasted by battle droids. Heck, he didnâ€™t come to Vjun to get blasted by anythingâ€¦ yet here he was, in the thick of it.
He surveyed the area in front of him and tried to get a feeling of what was going on.

Knowing better than to get in the path of armed men running past, Adric stays put where he is. However, he makes no attempt at hiding from the group either.
Spinning his blaster around his finger, Ven lowers the weapon to look non-threatening. The last thing he needed was to become a target of opportunity by mistake. Besides, if this group meant him harm, the odds are he couldnâ€™t stop all of them.
Ven hoped these armed men were allies. If he was to get out of this situation alive, his best chance may just lie with them.

Ven guessed he should count his blessings that the soldier didnâ€™t just blast him where he stood.

Ven stepped into line with the troops, happy to be alive.

If he went back on the ground level and traveled that way he would be harder to spot until he got to the desired elevated position. He wasn't sure though, he didn't know the situation well enough.
Meanwhile, Vor'en thinks back to his tactics as he is talking with the newcomer Falsoor employee. His squad had to keep the momentum. Momentum was always better, it gave the enemy less time to counter anything you did. He realized he needed Ven to go with them right now or get away from his unit.

*Gor you are in too much pain to concentrate for a Force trance. Aymaric and Ven, I need to know if you are going with Vor's squad.*
Vor'en makes sure his unit's order of march gets squared away and then continues the jog to Gor's estimated position. They pass through alley after alley past trash compactors, storages bins, and power generators.
After moving for about 226 meters, he sees a expansive open area that led to a huge building. It looks like the building Xander described with a gray exterior, silver trim, and multiple viewports. It had a big sign over the entrance that read "P-57 Headquarters" in Basic. There was a large main road that had beacons to signify it was a street. The street came in from the east residential area, went straight to the building, and turned in front of it.
The area around the road was wide open but there were buildings lined next to the street on each side. According to the signal, Gor was about 185 meters away (125 squares) in that open area. It appears as if the target was covering the street as an avenue of approach. It made sense tactically, because this section of the colony funneled traffic in. Most people would walk through this area. There was limited cover down the main street, but the buildings around it would function as cover. Vor's squad had to get to the main street but he would have to figure out how to get past this danger area safely. There were few places for cover on the road except a few speeders and plasteel bins. Vor'en or the others could see no trace of the target as they sat in the alley. Vor'en did spot Xander on one of the rooftops to the southwest, about 150 meters away from the building.
While Xander sat on the rooftop, he had to either search here for the target, or move up some more. It was up to him. He did have a clearer view of the area now. He scanned the street but still could not see Gor or any targets. He put his scope on his rifle and then slowly searched the street. He spotted Gor laying in a puddle on the street. Blood was mixing with the acid rain and it seemed his right leg had a gaping wound in it. He seemed to still be conscious. He was about 39 meters from the Headquarters on the main street. It looked like Gor was running due north across the long way of the street.

The squad acknowledges Vor'en's order of movement and proceeds east into the line of buildings parallel to the street. They took a path from the current alleyway they were in.
Dorijidan was on point of the formation carefully sweeping everything in front of him with his light repeating blaster. He's keeping his whole body in a low-walking stance for added stealth. The Sergeant had ordered everyone to proceed slowly and quiet to avoid detection. They would be moving like this for roughly 100 meters through the buildings until they were on Gor's flank.
After about 30 meters down an alley, Sgt. Vor'en catches a corner that exposes a big open area to the avenue of the street. He realizes he has no choice but to cross this area. He halts the squad to take a look at the corner. The next 3 story building of cover was 15 meters away. He orders his men to cross one by one and to dash across the open area.
The squad makes it into the next alleyway as Theos is bringing up the rear. Theos holds on the corner and looks at the rest of the unit on the other side. He dashes crazily but slips on the acid rain covered duracrete floor and slaps it hard. He struggles to recover as a cloud of red mist jumps out of his back. Theos collapses into a heap as his blaster cannon hits the ground in a clatter.
Vor'en watches in horror as he can't tell what just hit Private Theos.

Aymaric looks across the building area that he was at. There were no more open areas that he would have to worry about if he was just staying put as Vor'en asked everyone to do. Aymaric didn't have to listen to Vor'en, but maybe he had the right idea. Would Aymaric lay down cover fire with the others?
While Aymaric was observing his surroundings, Sav looked towards the important looking building down the main street. He looked at all the darkened viewports which were rooms for the massive headquarters building he had worked in a few times. If anyone wanted to shoot people from a safe place the HQ building was the biggest and tallest in the colony. However, Sav couldn't see anything threatening from this distance.
Meanwhile, Awne and Vor'en go down the north row of buildings to zero in on Gor's signal. They were running at a fast pace to get to his position. Vor'en took a moment to notice that the troublesome rain wasn't slowing down, but at least rain would hide the sound of his footfalls as he and Awne ran.
They move about 120 meters as they are nearing the direct flank of Gor 'Ak. They pass between many buildings making sure to keep the buildings between them and visual exposure of the main street. They dart between a 4-way alley to one small building that was close to Gor's position. Vor'en crosses the 4-way open section first, followed by Awne. While Awne is running, she hears a thump hitting the duracrete behind her. It was a small blaster crater where she had been running through. Something had taken a shot at her and missed, hitting the ground harmlessly. Awne looks back on the corner but she didn't see where it was coming from.
They move around to the other corner they just ran to and can see the opening of the main street. Gor was laying down bleeding in the rain next to a few plasteel bins that would serve as minor cover. Gor was about 54 meters away *36 squares.* If they wanted to go any further to Gor, they would be exposed to the open danger area. If they were going to get Gor, the dash would start here.
*Vor'en has given the order to lay down suppressing fire at the HQ building viewports. Let me know who is shooting and who isn't. Those who are shooting will be doing so next to the building that's facing the south towards the HQ building and street about 152 squares away. Let me know what you guys are aiming at.

Dorijidan nods and jumps out in the alley to cover Woro and Lance across the 15-meter wide area. The Wookiee and the soldier sprint to Theos. Woroken hooks him under his armpits and drags him quickly with his overwhelming strength. Lance picks up the blaster cannon and then dives for cover against the building corner.
Everyone reaches cover, except Dorijidan. No one had even seen or heard anything. Dorijidan was down and not moving. Theos had been dragged to cover, but Dor was out. Woroken quickly assessed Theos with his medical ability and then followed by the Force. Theos was dead, as if he had died instantly. He had been shot through the heart. Woroken could tell it was definitely a blaster hole in his chest. Where were the bolts coming from?
No one else could see any targets at the moment.

"Not again," the wookiee thought as he examined teh body of the now deceased Theos. What was hitting them, and where was it coming from? As these thoughts formulated in his brain, he saw that Dor had been hit as well. As there was nothing to be done for Theos at the moment, Woro turned to Lance and growls, "Cover me with the cannon...I am going to get Dor." Saying that, he jumps out from behind the cover, and runs for the soldier.
*OOC I don't know how far Dor is from our little cover area, but I am going to try to get to him, and drag/carry him back to the "safe" area we are in now.*

Woroken notices that Dorijidan was about 4 meters away. He reaches out and drags Dorijidan back behind the building with ease.
The Bothan had been shot in the upper-body to throat. He had just passed away as Woroken was dragging him. Vor'en's unit had suffered 2 KIA, which he would have to report to the Lieutenant. Private Theos and Private Dorijidan Malhaf. The death count was now 3 against Red Team; against an enemy they didn't even know.

Woroken opens his comlink and growls to his friends, Vor'en and Awne,mostly just to check and see if they were still alive, "Both Dor and Theos are dead. Lance and I are holed up around the corner of a building. We still haven't seen an attacker. I think we are okay here, but we need a new plan and fast. How are things on your end?"
He focuses his mind for a moment, trying to detect any disturbances in the Force that might reveal where the possible snipers were based. If the team could just figure out where the enemy was, they could come up with a plan for dealing with them.

Woroken calms his mind and allows the Force to flow freely through him. He can sense a broad area around him and he opens his eyes with the Force to guide him to the position. Unfortunately, Woro couldn't sense anything in the near area, which meant the enemy was not close to them at all. The enemy was making mid to long range shots.

After Vor had been shot, Awne released her concentration with the Force with an outstretched hand. Vor, Awne, and Gor' Ak immediately become invisible to the eye. Awne and Vor promptly move over to Gor's position and carry him via his shoulders and legs. Within seconds they successfully get Gor 'Ak to cover without taking any more fire.
Back in the alley 230 meters away, Aymaric charges into the open on the far side of the street. He takes his holorecorder and zooms it to the HQ building and promptly records it.

*Where are you aiming at the HQ building? Specifics is everything here. As it sits anything on the HQ is long range -10. A scope treats it as one less -5. But I'm assuming accurate makes it -2? You have to make a successful perception check to even see the target before you can engage. You have to go on where you think any targets are then you have to take time to search. You can't aim and all that without spotting a target first, unless you are shooting into a square where you think a target occupies.

*Sorry, got a little excited I guess : I fully intended to make a perception check before hand, just left that out. I'm scanning the top of the building, where I saw the flash in the recording. Perception +7 and if I roll poorly I'll use my rerolls. I wasn't intending to fire unless I can spot the sniper and have time to aim.
Unfortunately after rereading it I got the range penalty wrong. Accurate weapons don't reduce the range category by one like a scope or Farshot, they just don't take a penalty to attacks at short range. Had I known that I probably would have taken Farshot over Weapon Focus but oh well. That will leave me at the -5 penalty then. For now I suppose just let me know if I can find him, I might need to move closer. Oh, and I'll move to where I can get a decent look at the rooftop even if that means leaving myself out in the open.

He estimates that any targets on the roof were probably trying to stay concealed or covered.

Sav Nartano sets out to find some enemy targets while using cover. He goes along the west side of buildings were Vor'en and Awne had been. He sneaks carefully and uses the corners of buildings to continuously scan the rooftop every 30 meters or so. He has a hard time seeing any targets in this weather and low-light. The Falsoor employee travels up the entire western half of the buildings and comes to a corner about 60 meters from the HQ building. He hadn't been spotted yet, but if he wanted to get any closer he would have to run out into the open area surrounding the building.
Meanwhile, Xander hears that the target's location was somewhere on the roof. He then runs around the research building that had denied him entrance on proceeded through the eastern half of the buildings. He got about 50 meters out from the HQ building and began running into the open area. He rushes as fast as he can as he hears the impact of a blaster bolt hit behind him. Another energy blast whizzes dangerously close to him. *Xander takes 12 dmg bringing you to 54 hp.*
He hits the wall of the large Headquarters building on the side of it. There didn't seem to be any buildings behind this one, and there were no entrances here. He could only see viewports up to the top of the roof, he still couldn't see any targets. The targets were probably on the front side of the roof. It was likely the targets couldn't see him anymore as no one else was shooting. Beyond this building, there seemed to be the large open desert and rocks of Vjun. This signified that this HQ was at the end of the colony.

Vor'en thiks ovr his options. Most of what he had was there in front of him, two dead men, one almost, two Jedi and one green recuirt. This mission was getting to be to costly. "Feldon grab someone and get out here to meet Woro and Awne with one wounded." Turning and looking at Awne. "You and Woro get Gor to Feldon as fast as you can. I will stay hear and supress the front of the building for Xander." Grabing Theos blaster cannon and Dor's Light repeater. Slinging the cannon, and grabing a few extra blaster packs from there bodys. "Go now, come back if you can." Vor'en runs back to the building where the sniper was, taking up position in cover infront of the building. "Xander, i am going to light up the front get ready." Shouldering the cannon and bracing it he opens up.
((OCC: +8 to attack going to fire at the front of the building.))

Sav sees the cannon fire streaking towards the HQ building and curses under his breath. He hadn't wanted to let the sniper(s) know their position had been compromised until he had a clean shot at one, but oh well. Hopefully the cannon fire will cover him while he clears the open area.
*Dash through the open area and hopefully get back behind cover before I get shot. Also, I have Low-light vision if that helps in these conditions. Perception +7*

Staff Sergeant Vor'en runs back to Woroken's position and quickly grabs Dorijidan's light repeating blaster. Within seconds, he had quickly moved back to the set of buildings close to where Gor' Ak had been injured. He arms the blaster cannon and peeks out past a corner.
He observes the HQ building and fires a shot at the top set of viewports. The huge bolt travels quickly towards the building and shatters at least 4 viewports. A little bit of the actual building structure crumbles due to the blast. Vor'en aims in for another shot, but as he does, a blast of energy strikes him dead in the center of his chest. Red mist shot out of his body with immense pain. His armor had definitely been penetrated as he feels the shot had struck a mortal blow. Vor'en collapses immediately, dead. The enemy had quickly sighted in to his loud blaster cannon shot.
*Sav, what cover are you running to? There is only a wrecked speeder that would provide decent cover between the building you where at and the HQ building. Do you want to run 15 squares to the speeder or 36 squares to the building?*

Woro begins to act on the advice of Vor'en. He reaches out to support Gor, who had clearly taken a good deal of damage, and had, at minimum a broken leg. That was beyond the wookiee's ability to heal, so he needed to see Feldon as soon as possible. "You ready to get to Master Feldon, Awne?"

*No, I guess you don't take damage.*
Xander travels up the length of the building. After a few moments, he clears the siding of the rooftop and lands on the duracrete roof. He loses his footing and lands on his back. The noise from falling over alerts a battle droid that was 54 meters away looking over the siding to the street. The roof was long and there was one large satellite dish on southeast part of the building. There was nothing else on top of the roof besides the dish and the battle droid. The battle droid had gray paint and it was wielding an odd blaster rifle with a high-powered scope. No doubt this was the sniper causing so much trouble. The droid turns to face Xander. He drops his blaster rifle and pulls a pistol out from his side and fires at Xander. The bolt whizzes past Xander harmlessly.

Just as Xander is about to fire back at the sniping droid, he hears the hiss of a turbolift panel. A figure emerges from behind the satellite dish. Xander spotted the all too familiar energy signature of a weapon he couldn't believe he was seeing. He was looking at a lightsaber.
As if the figure glided, it was quickly just a few feet from Xander. The person had a crimson lightsaber glowing brightly as it was burning the rain around it. The mysterious person waved a hand at the droid and it holstered its pistol. The figure removed its hood.
It was Mur Eva.

Woroken felt Vor'en's pain rush over him like a tidal wave through the power of the Force. He wasn't about to let the Sergeant go down like the rest of today's victims. He remembered the commands from the General which instructed him to keep Vor'en safe. He would not ignore those orders. He knew the Bothan didn't understand him, but he hoped Gor would understand the mission had to come first.
He made sure Gor was hidden from view of the sniper, and followed in Awne's footsteps, rushing to the aid of Vor'en. Vor'en would need Woro's medical help more than Awne, who wasn't as good a healer, if he was hurt as bad as the wookiee feared. "I'm coming, too," the wookiee hissed at Awne as he tried to follow her path to his friend.

Woro was not a fan of Awne's plan. He paused for a few seconds, before muttering, "May the Force be with you, Awne. Now hurry up and go get Vor. I'll be right back."
He turns and grabs the Bothan under his shoulder, giving support to his shattered leg. The wookiee points in the general direction of the cantina, hoping Gor could understand that was the direction to head off in to join Feldon and Lorhas. "Hurry up now," he said, despite knowing Gor could not understand him.

He didn't need the Com traffic from his new helmet to tell him there was another Soldier down. He saw Sergeant Vor'en get hit square in the chest and go down hard. The situation was getting way out of hand. Aymaric leaves the stretchers with the dead Soldiers, they had become low priority now.
Quickly running over to Awne and Vor'en's location, he pulls the no moving body of Vor'en back into cover. When he has the Sergeant in a relativly safe location he immediately starts the procedures he needs to save the life that is now in his hands.
He pulls the Defibrillator and repirator units out of the kit and hands the respirator to Awne, assuming she knows how to use it. "Start using this now!" The medic charges the Defibrillator and prepares to revive the Sergeant.

"I could use a save about now, and a stiff drink would nice to. Xander, sitrep if you please. Is the sniper dead?" Laying on his back Vor'en knew he was going to here about this one from Awne. She had seen him shot up before but she still she would gave him the fifth degree about getting shot again.

Aymaric gets to Vor'en's position and quickly notices he is not in critical condition anymore, but he would benefit from surgery if you all deemed you had the time. Awne and Woroken follow up to the covered position shortly after. After Aymaric unstraps Vor'en's camo breast plate, you notice it was lucky that Vor'en mostly suffered from a flesh wound. He had minor damage to his insides but nothing Aymaric couldn't probably fix. His armor did its job fortunately. Vor'en could act normally though.
Back on the rooftop, Mur Eva squares off with Xander, lightsaber in an attack posture. The droid seemed to be taking orders from her as he just held his pistol trained on Xander. Xander was able to notice something that seemed strikingly different about her.

Woroken could scarecly believe the voice he heard on teh other end of the com addressing Xander...Master Mur Eva. She sounded different--colder. Upon hearing the voice, he ignores Awne's directions. "Awne, we have to get to the roof. Aymeric can tend to Vor'en, and Gor is hidden and stable. Our directions are to find Mur Eva.

In the interim, he was listening closely to Mur Eva and Xander's conversation. Woroken has seen what Mur Eva could do in battle. Hopefully Xander would listen to Awne, and get off that roof. It would take Xander, Woro, and Awne to hold her off, if she were to attack.

Before Woroken can saber the door, Sav enters his security code and the door opens promptly. It seems there were was a blast door up and then a regular durasteel door. The trio walks through the hissing doorway into the reception area.
There was a center desk console that overlooked many security vid panels on the wall. The floor were polished to a bright white sheen. The emergency red lights barely illuminated the room. It had a very sterile feel as everyone entered with their sopping wet clothing. The console likely housed a receptionist but no one was here at the moment. The room was quite big and it ushered four other hallways that led to various administrative offices. There was a turbolift in the right corner of the large room. The lab and research facilities were on the upper floors. The storage areas were in the middle floors of the building. Sav realized that the turbolift would give access to the roof.

She moves quickly into the building looking around and moving to the lift "Get this thing rrunning werre rrunning out of.." she trails off as the com goes dead on the side of Xander, panic was setting it; did he turn it off or was he dead? she hoped for his sake he was dead otherwise he would be when she got her hands on him. A dark thought but all training was going out the window at the notion of her pack in trouble and was relying heavily back on her training and experience as a mercenary over the little time she'd been a Jedi.

Thumbing his comlink, "Gor we need to remove the anti-ship turrets, I noticed you had Detonite. We should be able to use that and this thermal detonator to destroy them or their power supplies. Do you feel well enough to move there?" He then tries to get the attention of the Ship captain who had attempted to land inside the facility. "Captain of the republic transport....This is Aymaric Destmaur. The stranded Falsoor survivor your group picked up when they landed. Your team has had some serious complications and WILL, I say again, WILL need your help. I am now in the process of disabling the anti-air turrets on the(north?) side of the facility. When can you be ready to provide fire support and EVAC?"
The former Republic grunt Knows enough, from his training a few years ago, to realize that the walking casualties needed a secure place to heal and this little group of Soldiers was out gunned, or at the very least, out manuevered. Bringing in the ship would allow them to both EVAC the casualties and destroy any ground troops who are posing a problem.
While all this is being said, Aymaric multi-tasks by removing the Bandolier with Power Pax, thermal detonator and remaining grenades as well as the Heavy Blaster Rifle /w grenade launcer and rest of theos' armor from his body.
And finally, to no one in particular and everyone who can hear,"To all who remain, as I don't know what the (Star Warsie explative) is going on, a regrouping and head count might be in order. Not my decision or call to make, but it would be a good idea."

*The turbolaser turrets you speak of are spread out hundreds of meters throughout the colony, it would take some time to get those destroyed. But there might be other ways to get them offline since you are with fellow Falsoor employees. You guys have access to a lot of stuff.
I'm not sure if you have the frequency of the Republic transport that the other players came with. But it wouldn't really be worth the time to get the ship able to land here. For the most part the medical problems could be handled back at the cantina, Aymaric would realize that. Your evac plan could work, but it might take more time than its worth when all you have to do is get everyone to the cantina. Not saying having the ship land at a later time wouldn't be a benefit, its just your character would realize that immediate medical aid is available at the cantina. I don't know what you have fully planned so do what you want.
As far I know, a destiny point doesn't repair jet packs. So, I'll have to rule that you are dead Xander. Yes, some of the players may be unhappy with this call. But Xander made a bold move against an enemy he didn't know who he was dealing with, he made a chance and it didn't pay off. My game is dangerous. I hope this is a lesson to get you all to band together OR come up with better ways to fight like loners if that is what you choose. Don't take it too negatively though, Xander killed the sniper and at a minimum bought you all time to get away.*

Woro's heart broke seeing the Farghul in such pain. Yet another death today. He patted Awne's shoulder to provide her emotional support. "Awne," the wookiee said as softly as he could muster, "we need to get Xander's body out of here. I can get him. Let's head back to the cantina and talk about all this."
The wookiee still couldn't process everything that had happened. It appeared from hearing the com from Xander that Mur Eva was menacing him--the next minute he had fallen from the roof, and his jetpack had obviously not worked. Was it possible that Mur Eva could have done this?

Awne nods her head though she still hugs the body tightly a moment longer before standing and offering the wookiee the body. Her tail wasn't waving, rather moving to her hands to hold like she use to do when she was a child and sad and didn't have her doll. She waits for the wookiee to get him situated before moving, the soldier in the office forgotten in her borken mindstate.
It was still raining, it would take her a while before realising she was crying, all she knew was that if they get him to Feldon...

Awne picks up the twisted remains of Xander. Blood, guts, and bones were spilling out of the mandalorian armor. It was quite difficult to keep the remains of him intact. Though his body was still salvageable. It would be heavy to carry the body, all the equipment, and the armor.

Lues and Feldon meet the others who were carrying Dorijidan and Theos. They assist by helping them carry their equipment. Vor'en, Awne, Woroken, and Sav make their way across the deadly main street back into the alley where they initially attacked from. The entire group in separate teams carries their dead/wounded back to the cantina 150 meters with no more incidents.
When Awne's group arrives at the cantina, everyone notices that Feldon had begun triaging the injured. He had whoever was hurt sprawled out on bar tables. It was time to treat the wounded and sort through the mess that had just occurred. Sgt. Vor'en would have to evaluate the mission and go from here, if he was any condition. Feldon was unstrapping Vor'en's armor to give him treatment.

Feldon looks at Vor'en and the wound on his chest.
Feldon: "You're one tough hombre Sarge. A shot like that would of kept most people down. Just try and relax."
The Jedi Knight closes his eyes and presses his hand against the bleeding chest wound. Within seconds, Vor'en can feel the pain in his wound subsiding. He was already feeling a lot better. Just not as good as he wanted to be.

Sav glances uncomfortably around the cantina, with no medical training he feels pretty useless right now. Plus the sight of a jedi going to pieces really unnerves him, weren't they supposed to be all placid and emotionless? Seeing no better use of his time Sav lights a smoke and makes his way over to the bar. The rodian finds a couple of clean glasses to go along with a bottle of Corellian whiskey and brings them back to the others. He pours himself a drink, downs it, and refills it before pouring another glass. This one he offers to Awne, "Here drink this. It won't make the pain go away but...well, it'll make it more bearable." He has no idea if jedi drink but it's the only comfort he can think to offer.

He is approached by Woroken, and master Feldon. As Feldon works his hands over his legs, Gor feels a sudden warmth flowing through his legs, and he can feel the pain subsiding. As the jedi stops his work, and gives the report that Gor might still have trouble walking, he just nods.

She sniffs and nods her head slightly, she'd help him, but it would be a while before she'd be her old self. Still, in an effort to lift her own spirits and his, she looks at him, kisses his cheek and hits him openhanded in the gut lightly "Next time listen to me."

Aymaric spends about ten minutes assessing the situation and comes to the conclusion that he was better off here with the wounded than out there in the facility trying to destroy all those Turrets. "What a brilliant idea that was, eh." Muttering this comment to himself made him realize he hadn't been listening to much of the conversation going on and missed what Sergeant Vor'en had said about a new squad. He didn't give it much attention at this moment because he had noticed the healing job the Jedi had done on Gor and was mightily impressed.
Walking over to check out the Jedi's handy work he noticed that gor could do with a little extra surgery. "Gor'ak, would you mind if I mend that broken shin?" He lays down his recently gained equipment at Gor's feet and starts to pull out his doctoring tools. "Here, these will help with the pain." Aymaric hands Gor six pills from a bottle that is labeled *PAIN KILLER, GENERIC*. Then pulls a light blue tube out of the kit,"And this will numb the area around the leg I am going to work on." The substance that comes out of the tube is similar in consistancy to syrup and the color of Corellian Brandy. "Now give this a minute while I set up the surgery area." The largest table in the room soon becomes an impromptu operating table using supplies gained from the limited surgery kit in the medical kit. "Okay Gor, come on over and hop up on the table. Get it...hop...hop...hop, you have one good leg......oh forget it." The smile cutting across this young mans face gives anyone the idea that he really likes this part of his job. "this shouldn't hurt...too much."

That goes for you too Sav, I marked you for the pistol and grenades. Make sure you guys upgrade your sheets on the character sheets section. The helmets are nice because it allows you to talk on com without using any turns, they are hands free.*
Vor'en hears the comlink transmission returned.
Sierra Main: "That is UNACCEPTABLE Red Seven. Remember your SpecForce standard operating procedure, hit-and-run! You aren't here for any engagements. You lay down as much fire as you can so the enemy thinks you are a big force, then you retreat. I doubt you could have taken that many casualties if you were following the SOP..."
There is a pause in the com transmission.
Sierra Main: "Continue with the mission. But make sure the people you've assimilated into your squad know basic tactics and can handle a blaster. I doubt you've had much training on how to train locals to fight with you. Or did you do that back in the Remnant? If you take any more casualties, I'm going to come run your squad. Were you able to gather any intelligence about the enemy we were facing?"
Radon looks at Sav as he talks about joining the New Republic. Sav was taking his new DH-17 pistol and putting it in Dor's old thigh holster around his leg.
Radon:"I recognize you, you are one of the guards right? I fly cargo ships here every three weeks. You are going to join these guys just like that?! I like them, but they get into a lot of messes. Why would you do something like that?"
Meanwhile, Aymaric sets up his surgery tools on the biggest table in the cantina. He cuts open Gor's leg expertly and begins working on the broken bones. He estimated that within the next hour he would have the bone artificially mended by a gel substance that was just as durable as bone. It would just take some careful application of the substance. Technology was great.
It seems in light of what Woroken has told the Jedi, they all assemble at the bar and begin talking seriously.

After waiting for a few moments to see if the Jedi had more questions for him, Woroken heads upstairs and grabs one of the open beds to grab some shut eye. He was not a great planner of strategy. Everyone else could do that and fill him in later.

Gor happily accepts both AymaricÂ´s medical aid, and the drink offered from Sav. Mixing strong drinks with thos pills might not be a good idea, but he was really in a condition where he didnÂ´t give a damn anymore. Hopping around on his leg, he grins a little. It still hurt, but way less than before, and should be manageable.
"Thanks. Now, since IÂ´ve apparently been designated new commander over one of you but donÂ´t know which one, IÂ´ll tell you both to follow VorÂ´ens orders and be ready for tomorrow"
As Jedi seemed to gather to discuss Jedi buissness, he finished his glass, and went upstairs to get some rest.

Having been on rear guard duty Lance was just catching up to the current situation. Walking into the cantina seeing the sadness, feeling the sadness and overhearing bits of conversation here and there is enough to realize the groupâ€™s loss. Lance takes a quite moment to reflect on the fallen â€œMay the force be with you, free are you from your corporeal shell.â€ Something his master had said but Lance just grasped the meaning.
Lance nods to Vor`en`s order of leading team one. â€œI will do what I can Vor`en. Letâ€™s just finish this mission and be done with it.â€ As it is getting late Lance takes the time to address every member of team one and setting watch parameters. Lance himself spends his time walking the beat between all the established watch points.
As Lance walks he can feel the mood of the other members of the team most of all from Awne. Walking through the area Lance tryâ€™s to focus on the woman, reaching out through the force he attempts to send a message to her. Not exactly words but a message of comfort through his emotions.

Lance sends his heartfelt sympathy through the Force to Awne. He wraps his compassion in a message and directs it straight to the Farghul.

Awne breathed deeply at the feeling of warmth that just swept over her. She smiled, for once since the loss and the fight, and looks to the ceiling. She smiles, so, the human knew how to use the force..she'd have to ask him about it sometime. All the same she sends him a soft message of thanks, it did make her feel better even with a few tears slipping they were more happy then they had been.

Lorhas motions to the bar stools. He pushes a non-functional serving droid out of the way to take his seat.
Lorhas: "Well, this is the strange part. None of us can detect her presence but him. So what this is going to come down to, is whether or not we trust his affinity in the Force. That'll determine where we go with this search for Mur Eva. I have to tell you that I do trust Lues."
Feldon: "I do, without question. I sense that Lues has a sharp mind for this."
Lues: "I can tell you this Sergeant, she is out there, she is in pain. Jes Mur Eva needs our help. But we've been told by our authority figures that you have complete command so long as you are capable."

Sav contemplates Radon's offer while nursing his drink. The man's accusation gives Sav pause. Jedi were already disturbing enough without hearing about one throwing her "friend" off a roof and now another one wrecking Radon's podracing career. Still, it seems like Vor'en is in charge so perhaps he can keep them in line. Well, as best anyone can anyways. He closes his eyes and replays the events of the last several hours in his memory. He simply can't leave, not yet, not until he finds out what happened here. Sav has also noticed how close-knit this squad seems to be and that's something he is envious of; things certainly weren't that way on Falsoor security teams. Having made his decision Sav opens his eyes, "No, thank you though. I have to see this through. I'm not sure I want anything to do with Falsoor now anyways. Something *wrong* happened here, and we're going to find out what."

Vor'en stands and streches. "I will see you in the morning Master Lorhas, Feldon, Lues." Vor'en heads up stairs to find aplace to rest, keeping his blaster pistol with him.

"Now, try not to get yourself shot there again with-in the next few weeks or I will have to turn your flesh leg into a mechanical one." This is said with mock seriousness and a slight smile.
He then starts to clean up his supplies. Gathering them and taking them to the counter behind the bar and using the sonic sterilizer on the non-disposable surgical items.
Once done he starts to inspect all the remaining group members for what he could help heal. The physical wounds at least. And, when everyone is bandaged up he will begin the grusome task of removing Theos' armor.

He had lost friends trying to carry out the mission, but he still felt their presence around him, which gave him some comfort. The Force certainly worked in mysterious ways.
A night of rest had done the wookiee well. He wasn't quite 100%, but he was feeling much better. Almost all of spots where the rain had wicked through his fur were healing nicely. He gathered up his usual gear and went downstairs to meet with everyone.

Testing his legs, he felt that the pain was all but gone, and few signs remained that he had taken serious injuries just the day before. Aymaric had done a good job indeed.

She turns from him to look out the viewport, her hand moving to her light saber and igniting it, looking to the purple light in contemplation before deactivating it and returning her eyes to the dark outside.
Her thoughts were in many places; death, family, the force, life...looking out at the desolate view before her she suddenly had a longing for her home, for the tall trees that always made her feel so...alive.

I kill for a cup right now." He moves to where he left his gear and starts to suit up for the day. "So we are going to check out that HQ again. I want everyone to stick to cover and we stay with in 3 meters of each other. An sign of a sniper or attack we lay down fire and run, we are not here to fight a war just need intell and grab the Jedi we are here for. Understood!?"

After the meeting with Sergeant Vor'en, Aymaric walks over to the bar and gets himself some food. He gathers up some fruit and pre-packaged food. The meal takes him 20 minutes to finish, which gives him a chance to relax in one of the lounge chairs along the wall. He slowly starts to doze off as he waits for the order to move out.

He quietly attempted to strike up a conversation with his clearly struggling friend, patting her on the arm. "You okay, Awne? I mean, are you as okay as you can be after everything that has happened the last few days?" He continued," You know we need you --don't check out on us. Things are going to get better, I promise.

Gor noted the look VorÂ´en shot him, and he took the pike clearly. His actions the other day had been a little reckless, but he held no regrets he had taken them. Nevertheless, today would be different. Checking his ion gun, he readied the weapon for combat, suspecting that VorÂ´en was right, and more droids would be around. He really didnÂ´t like the idea of a Dark Jedi running loose though, but he supposed that was why they had brought a few masters of theor own.

The half-sleep state that Aymaric was in allowed him to hear bits and pieces of conversations being held around the cantina. One particular conversation had enough key words in it to make Aymaric become fully awake. He rubs the sleep from his eyes and heads over to Sergeant Vor'en. "Sergeant, I couldn't help but over hear your concern for the droids that might still be here and the lack of appropriate weaponry to deal with them effectivly, I might have a solution. There is a small armory east of here which, when fully stocked has Ion weapons. The problem is the chance that they may already be gone."

He unslings his rifle and puts it on stun while backing away from the two disoriented Jedi. "What the Farc is going on!" This..he really didn't like.

The group proceeds 150 meters through the dark settlement and arrives at the all too familiar speeder road that was passing the HQ. Lorhas and the others confirm they sensed no immediate danger as the unit went down the east row of structures to the HQ.

The Wookiee quickly took a breath, calming his mind and stretching out his feelings. He felt close to detecting what Lorhas felt, but not close enough.

Aymaric realizes that information the group needed was likely in the HQ. But, most information would have security ratings and be difficult to access. If they were to go in there, the unit would have to deal with great danger for information that would be trouble to get.
Master Lorhas looks at Vor'en as he stands near the front durasteel doors.
Lorhas: "I can't give you specifics, the dark side is too rich. I can tell you its dangerous, but we could be ok if your men commit to the objective one hundred percent and work together. That's what I feel."

Sav simply listened while the jedi expressed their concerns. All the doom and gloom made him a little uneasy, but then again they said this whole planet was evil. Maybe they're just on edge. Sav decided not to worry about the jedi's vague warning, there was nothing he could do about it now anyways. When Vor'en asks if everyone's ready Sav nods, "I'm in Sarge. We'll make our own luck." With that he moves up to the door, ready to open it when the command is given.

Just as Sav enters the code into the door panel, the doors hiss open. Sergeant Vor'en goes in first with his rifle at the ready followed closely by Awne. At first sight, nothing was suspicious in the main lobby of the HQ. It was an expansive room, but had no real good cover spaces for hiding.
There was a center console with multiple computers and vidscreens that Vor'en quickly cleared. There were small turbolift shafts in the right corner that were searched by Team 1 just as Team 2 was clearing the left side of the room. There were 3 double doors on the left, back, and right side of the lobby.
The floors were polished white and the red emergency lights illuminated the room. It was clear in the reception area of the HQ.
Awne could see nothing of danger or detect anything in this particular area. However, the Dark Side presence was growing. There wasn't even bodies in this room, or any battle damage like everything else.

The computer comes to life as the blue screen illuminates Aymaric's face. The first message he sees in Basic is...
Falsoor Research and Restoration
"Under the shadow of Falsoor, all shall grow and prosper."
The title screen goes away and a warning message flashes.
...WARNING, ALL SPECIMEN CONTAINMENT FIELDS ARE DOWN. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE ORDERED TO EVACUATE AND WAIT FOR DIRECTIVES FROM PROJECT MANAGERS.
After this warning, a menu comes up with hundreds of different options. He checks on the power status and discovers the power would not be able to be rerouted via computer. Someone would have to go to the generators in the sublevels of the compound to manually restore power.
Aymaric did spot an option to get into the security section of the HQ network. Surveillance was down. But, the facility did have many holocameras set up for monitoring.
He would have to improve his access to the computer to get further information. He types in a few bypass commands.

The hallway went on for about 100 yards. The hall was narrow and the ceiling low. The emergency lights were operating in this section as well. Doors were white durasteel and they had signs on the front of them. Most of the rooms here seemed to be storage areas of some sort.

Woroken observes the dead scattered among the hallway. He can derive that it likely a flame weapon of some type. Their wasn't much fire damage to the actual hallway or any doors. It seemed the flames that hit the bodies would be way too accurate for a natural fire. The bodies were not hot, but he was unable to tell how long they have been dead.
Gor 'Ak takes a close look at the bodies himself. They didn't seem to have any equipment to salvage, nor were there any weapons laying on the floor. It appeared they had been unarmed at the time of their death.

Each member of the squad points their weapons at the doorways just in case they opened with hostile targets.
Everyone walks past about a dozen charred bodies. That seemed to be all the dead in the hallway. The Farghul arrives at the cold storage doorway and promptly walks in.
Awne quickly notices she was in another small hallway. The floor leading to another set of double doors gradually changed to icy ground. It was a cold-quarantine section. Once everyone clutters into the small hall, a quarantine spray douses everyone slowly.
Awne could sense a presence in the Force in the next room as she was being quarantined. She looked over to Master Lorhas and it was apparent he felt it too.
The quarantine hall chimes.
PA Voice: "All clear, please enter and do not touch the embyro storage without protective equipment."
The doors hiss open to discover a well-lit sterile room. It was moderately sized and the room was all white in color. The floor was solid ice. There were computers lining both walls. They were humming and beeping at full power. There was a bigger computer box next to a viewport. The viewport was peering into a darkened room that you couldn't see from the doorway.
The unit floods the room in a tactical manner; without trying to slip on the ice. As you walk in, a figure can be see walking into the darkened room behind the viewport. There was a door leading into that dark area. The figure didn't see anyone, or so it seemed.

As if to answer the soldiers question, a huge dark figure stepped up to the view port directly in front of Awne, the figure was as tall as a Wookie and looked just as strong. One arm was concealed beneath part of a cloak and the other was completely revealed as if the giant was proud of it. His body was covered in armor which looked to have been painfully grafted to his very body as if the armor was actually his skin. His face was hidden behind a Mandalorian mask. The skin of his arm, the only skin that appeared to be exposed, was cracked and split, the flesh white and the veins a hideous black. The arm looked corrupted and sick as if the only thing keeping it alive was that very same corruption. In the hand was a large cylindrical object, and coming from it the distinct humming as from a lightsaber. The blade was barely visible in the dark lit room, around the blade was a pale black glow emanating from a sickly purple center. The blade itself looked as if that same corruption had tainted it. As if the once beautiful violet blade, much like the ones of the jedi of old, was dieing and could no longer shine in its beauty. The figure slowly glanced over the rabble standing just on the other side of the view port, the distinct sound of a respirator as he calmly took in his breaths. And in a horrifyingly deep metallic sound the figure spoke. "I am... Sarin... and you will fear me"

Gor didnÂ´t object to VorÂ´ens order. It would be really bad to have their exit suddenly cut off from out of nowhere. Keeping a vigilant eye towards where they came from, he heard the others poke around their buissness.
Suddenly he heard a strange sound indeed, and as he heard the distinctive humming of a lit lightsaber, he swung around. What he saw was strange was something that could have been taken out of a childerns horror story. It was a man - at least he thought it was a man - covered in armor, and partially hidden under a cloak. What could be seen of his flesh seemed painfully corrupted by something, and the same corruption seemed to radiate from the entire being.
Careful not to do anything hesitant, he kept his blaster at the ready, and awaited the response from the team.

Woro heard the command given by Vor'en and began falling back in accordance with the order. It would be better to regroup and come up with a plan to deal with this threat rather than foolishly rushing in as they had done the prior day.
He had to admit that he was intrigued by the hulking figure with the black lightsaber. He had never seen anything remotely resembling such a thing. What must have happened for a lightsaber to turn that color, he wondered.

Aymaric crosses in front of the viewport to get to the computer. However, he is unable to concentrate as the party begins motioning towards the figure in the darkness.
Awne watches as the viewport slides open as the frigid air pours into the already cold room. The door to the dark room whirs as the locking mechanism activates. Awne reaches out with the Force to attack the figure at the console in the dark room. There were 2 rooms to this area. The well-lit room with the computers the group was in, and the small dark room that was connected to the well-lit room. To most of the party the dark room was on there right, and Sarin was moving about in it.
Awne had attempted to strike first against the man with the black lightsaber before you saw a visible attack. Radon could be seen fleeing the room after things seemed to be getting dangerous.
*Sarin has concealment to you all unless you have low-light vision. Initiative count: Lorhas 29,Woroken 23,Gor 'Ak 22, Awne 20, Sarin 17, Sav 15, Aymaric 14, and Vor'en 11.*

Lorhas moves quickly as he senses the hostile intent coming from the man in the darkened room. He knew Awne was going into an attack posture with desire to strike. He moves from the entryway while maintaining his balance on the slippery floor *Difficult terrain*. He has to move considerably slower but gets close enough to the viewport to take action against Sarin.
He stretches out his hand and forcefully jolts Sarin away from the computer. Sarin is thrown back into the viewport wall as he tumbles through the port opening awkwardly. He smacks the icy floor hard, landing just inside the room with everybody else. He is prone.
Lorhas screams out...
Lorhas: "Careful, I sense the Force within this one!"
*Sarin suffers 10 damage for the fall. Sarin no longer has concealment. It is now Woroken's turn. Sarin's lightsaber is on the console in the darkened room.*
Woroken decides to act. Sarin was laying flat about 8 squares straight ahead from him. There was no cover in the room besides computers that were up against the wall. The rest of the squad was mostly bunched up in the doorway.

Woroken, seeing his Master take direct action against the dark figure, knows that Lorhas has sensed evil. Rather than moving, the wookiee pauses for a moment, and reaches out, calling with the Force, willing the unignited dark lightsaber to move to his hand. "A threat is no longer a threat without its weapon," Lorhas had once told him. If he could get the lightsaber away, perhaps the team would be safe.

Woroken realizes that the enemy's weapon was too far away from the door where he had been standing. *Not that he could see the lightsaber too well, he can sense its Force presence.* He attempts to move forward but slips on the ice and lands prone. *Failed acrobatics check.* He gets back up awkwardly and walks closer to the viewport. He was unable to be quick enough to snatch the lightsaber out of the dark room.

Gor turns to face the way the group came in. Keeping a watchful eye on any targets coming towards them. He could see nothing yet. But it was wise to watch for any surprises.
Awne looks over to her left where Sarin had been thrown out of the viewport. She turns to face the man on the ground. The Farghul raises her hand up and tenses her hand in a choking motion. Sarin grabs his throat as the Force was strangling his neck. The pain was intense and he had trouble taking any air. He felt like his head would pop from the pressure if she kept at it too long. She mercifully release the hold after about 4 seconds. *Sarin takes 12 damage and can only take a swift action on his turn. It is now Sarin's turn.*

Sav is a little taken aback by the situation, this had not been what he was expecting at all. Seeing the others charge in Sav decides to stay and fight as well. After all, Sergeant Vor'en did tell him to cover the jedi right?
Sav finds the man's pleas disturbing but if he wants death so badly then Sav will oblige. The rodian lines up a shot and fires.

The man's pleas seemed too easily given, Aymaric didn't trust anyone who exuded so much evil. The look of dread on Aymaric's face quickly turned to a look of sour disdain when the man on the floor, who just a moment ago said Aymaric will fear him, started whining about his pain. Although his first instinct had been to oblige the prostrate whiner, he decided to chose an alternate course. Not sure if this was the one the others referred to as Mur Eva, he switches his Heavy Blaster Rifle to stun and fires.
((2 Swift actions to switch to Auto fire and stun, then standard action fire a burst. +6 base, +1 from Awne buff, +2 from Gor's SURV talent,-5 for burst, -5 for Sarin lying prone= -1 for attack roll. IF it hits, 3d10+2 for HVY BLAS RIF and +2 dice for burst= 5d10+2 for damage.))

Sav and Aymaric fire their weapons at the downed cybernetic organism. They have trouble aiming at the flat target and the blaster bolts whiz past him harmlessly. The burst from Aymaric's weapon strikes the ground next to this behemoth of a man. It would seem the panic from the enemy contact had caused the novice shooters to miss.
*The surveillance skill worked. It now Vor'en's turn. If you guys don't mind could you get your ammunition counters up each time you fire your weapon?

Sgt. Vor'en watches as his companions fire shots from the doorway where they came in. Vor'en was about 3 meters away from the hulking man.
He extended his blaster carbine in front of him and fired a stream of blaster bolts. The weapon kicked solidly in his hand as he attempted to control the muzzle rise. The bolts were flying dangerously close to the prone target. A few rounds grazed and hit him as the the target was visibly being wounded. Most of the shots impacted on his metallic body.

For the first time in the encounter, Woroken activates his crystal blue lightsaber, and growls menacingly at the target to surrender.

Before, the darkness had not allowed him his true inspiring size. The giants head rose to over 8 feet tall, and it was over 4 feet from shoulder to shoulder. He was massive. It was clear now he was even larger than the wookie. Nearly the size of a Wampa.
It was unclear what made him this size, but whatever it was it had worked. Sarin lowered his head before the jedi knowing he would understand the gesture of surrender. "It is done."

Aymaric had intended on checking out the smaller room next to the room everyone, including the giant Sarin, was in to see why the facility needed to have a freezer this cold. Slinging his rifle and making his way past the two Jedi holding their lightsabers at Sarin's thoat, Aymaric checks his pants for any sign of moisture. Upon finding none, he mutters to himself, "Don't want to have my personals freeze off just because some monster from a Rancor's nightmare nearly scared all the fluid outta me. That'd be a hard explanation to mom about why she can't have grandkids." Just as he enters the doorway of the smaller room, he stops to take in the remaining part of the room he did not get a chance to see through the viewport.

Aymaric crawls over the viewport ledge after seeing no visible threats. He drops the tiny distance and lands in the next room. The Falsoor employee scans the small area. He sees the illumination switch and pushes it. Light floods the cold storage room.
Directly across from him in the left corner was a large computer system. There was a smaller unit right next to it. The smaller computer was the one Sarin had been accessing.
A few feet away from the computers, there were metal shelves stacked neatly against the walls. The shelves held many small cylindrical objects in a neat formation.
In the right corner of the room, centered to the storage area, there was an assembly line treadmill. The treadmill led to a tiny opening in the room. Hanging over the treadmill was a robotic arm with a spray-like appendage. That was all there was to the cold storage area. It seemed very sophisticated and spacious.
The Jedi Master looks over to Awne as he helps the man to his feet cautiously.
Master Lorhas: "Well Padawan, it's pretty obvious someone educated in the Jedi skills would have no problem with any retraining methods. We just have to let him know we are well-prepared to handle escape attempts.... Woroken, we will question this man and gather more information. Time is against us in this mission.

After verifying that his escape route was secure, the Falsoor employee moves over to the smaller computer console to see what information he can gain. He was also interested to find out how someone who was obviously not a Falsoor employee had access to this area.

The giant laughed in a demonic bellow. He found great amusement among these fools. "Do you really think... your threats mean anything?" "Look at me... there is nothing you could do... that would be more horrible... than what has already been done." The giant pulled off his mask for only a brief moment to reveal the horrific features beneath. His flesh was all but gone and his lower jaw was lost. Where his mouth should have been was a series of tubes and bionics. His throat had been replaced with a metallic tube feeding air to his lungs. His eyelids were gone and his eyes were exposed and red with irritation, pupils a sickly bright green. He had no hair or ears merely more wires and what flesh remained was corrupted and looked dead. The veins were a sickly black all across his skull and neck. As he began to suffocate the giant replaced the mask and locked it into place. "Save your threats... for one who has something to lose." "I came here... because of the dark power I felt in this place." "I had hoped... to grow stronger by learning more... from whatever this dark power was." "All I came to find... were those workers I killed and you fools." The giant turned to the Farghul and locked the masked gaze onto her eyes. It was obvious to her that behind that visor those sickly exposed eyes were gazing right into her. "You would do well... to not underestimate me." "The time may come... when you regret it." The demonic voice came to a halt and the giant returned his gaze to the jedi master. He gave no signs of resisting and remained standing upright and still.

Awne watches in an odd fascination at the sight of the giants true face, she wasn't fazed. Too many other emotions had long since taken place of any shock that may have come from that. Instead she only growls louder, fur standing on end as her hand started to twitch with an urge to just choke him again "Let me rremind you Giant, who it was that had you gasping forr airr not that long ago. I can do it again. Don't underrestimate me."

The older Jedi rubbed his chin in thought. It seemed that this mammoth trained in the ways of the Jedi perplexed the man.
Lorhas: "Well, we can't afford to let someone like this on the loose. We'll have to take him with us... but he might give away our position. In this situation stealth is the key. Be ready to take him down non-lethally should he do anything to compromise the mission. This one, is very difficult to read. I sense an empty void in his presence of the Force. Almost as if nothing is there. With the Dark Side here, it only makes things worse to try and get a feel for him."
Lorhas looks to Awne and Woroken.
Lorhas: "Search him, and take everything that he could use to endanger the mission."
While the Jedi is speaking, Vor'en tries to listen to the Lieutenant as well in his comlink. The cold temperature was beginning to irritate him.
Sierra Main: "Red Seven, you need solid proof that the items are illegal before you can confiscate it. What's worse, it's not a good idea to really take anything that belongs to Falsoor. We have no solid position against them. This mission has a very high clandestine nature, we don't want to be written off as thieves. If you can't get anything thoroughly incriminating, take photo samples with your holorecorder."

Disdain and anger are clear in Aymaric's voice "Jedi, willing to let a deranged lunatic prance around unhindered as long as they are kindred, even a murdering coward like this thing!" Aymaric's rath is strong, feeding off his fellow Falsoor's rage, the young man continues, pointing his angry stare away from Lorhas and turning it on the man who now has everyones attention. "You...you don't have enough courage to end your own suffering, so you cut down defensless civilians to prove how much pain you are in, then come into a room full of embryo's to prove your pain to those unborn!" The severly aggitated security medic's next statement is said in a mocking tone, "You would do well... to not underestimate me? YOU, would do well to not underestimate ME! I may not know how to fire a rifle well or swing a lightsaber, but I know ways to cause you pain that would make you think your current situation was just an annoying itch in comparison!" The intensity of Aymaric's tirade slackens. He then reaches underneath his cloak and produces his holdout blaster. "If you truly are in so much pain that you want your life to end, then prove your not a coward and let go of your self imposed pain." The blaster is tossed underhand at the man in the mask.

Sav breathes out slowly and heavily, trying to release some of the anger bottled up inside him. Heâ€™s no murderer, heâ€™s just frustrated. At Lorhasâ€™ words the rodian tears his gaze away from Sarin and looks at the jedi master. Sav sighs, â€œIâ€¦I know, youâ€™re right. Itâ€™s justâ€¦â€ glancing away he leaves the sentence unfinished. He takes another deep breath to calm himself. After a moment Sav refocuses his attention on Sarin, â€œI still want answers though. Where are the bodies you ugly son of a barve?â€. The rodian hasnâ€™t switched his weapon back to stun yet but he seems much more in control.
The farghulâ€™s comment makes Sav bristle. He doesnâ€™t like being threatened, especially not with jedi witchcraft. However, in an uncharacteristic display of restraint the rodian holds his tongue and waits for Sarinâ€™s response.
Sav's eyes widen when Aymaric tosses their prisoner a weapon. He wants the man dead as well but arming him wasn't exactly what Sav had in mind. Still, if it gives him an excuse to shoot the giant he might thank Aymaric afterward.

The giant watched unchanged at all the threats coming from so many angles. He looked down at the pistol. His emotions did not flare nor were there any to flare. He had none no pity no sadness no anger, only pain and that was what kept him alive, kept him strong. The giants low horrific metallic voice came once again. "Fear." As he spoke the word he could sense the fear that was inside them, though they hid it behind words and threats it was there. "Fear leads to anger." The angry hateful threats were proof enough that the dark side was winning in this room. His warnings to not underestimate him were coming through. Only the jedi was truly unflinching. Even the giant found some respect in the back of his twisted mind for that man who never took his thoughts off of him. As for the others their empty threats stemming from their hate for the giant did nothing to phase him. For their were many things the giant feared, but they were far far greater than anything in that room.

"Searching him now, Master," he told Lorhas as he sheathed his lightsaber and quickly began a check of the prisoner. "Please make sure he doesn't do anything...unfriendly, Awne." The lat thing Woro wanted was some hidden weapon to be put into action before he found it.

If they didn't start using some of that renowned wisdom to see this creature for the evil it is trying so hard to be, he would have to change his opinion of the mystical force users.
But his attention was averted quickly and his jaw dropped to fulle gape when he saw the Selkath step out of another room. He thought he recognized this one, there really weren't that many on Vijun, but he didn't spend alot of time in this part of the facility grounds, and to be honest they all looked the same to him. "Now what?" Once he recovers from the initial startle of the newcomer and closes his mouth, he slowly moves over to the Survivor and does a visual medical exam to determine the Selkath's condition.

"Sergeant Vor'en, I can vouch for this fellow as being a Falsoor employee. I've known of him for almost as long as I've been here, more as a party legend than actually knowing him though." He then turns his attention back to the more dark situation at hand, his grin turning to a scowl. Pointing at Sarin, " Sergeant Vor'en, considering this ones earlier exhibition of his cybernetics, I believe this one might be hiding some kind of cybernetic appendage. If this is the case and it is any kind of weapon, I could have it removed in a matter of minutes with no long term reprocutions. Then, when he has gained our trust, I can attach it again.

As the cloak was pulled away one more horror was revealed. Where there should have been another corrupted mass of muscle like the left arm there were only wires and more bionics. Patches of flesh were clinging to the bionic arm as if it was not ready to give up ground to the metallic abomination. The flesh intertwined itself in places obviously conferring its strength to the bionics. Metal with flesh hanging from it just made the giant look more monstrous. As the arm slid into view the hand was shown, and it had more horrors in itself. There were no fingers only claws each around 2 feet in length the longest being the middle finger the rest stepping shorter slightly. The horror was complete, now he truly looked more like a monster than a man. His horrible voice arose again. "As I said... It can not be taken." As he spoke the giant held out the hand to show that it was not hidden or attached, but the weapon WAS his arm. The giant then slid his arm back beneath the cloak and stilled himself once again, only the sound of his respirator was heard.

"I'm not sure what metal that claw is made out of, but I know it's a cybernetic prothesis and it can be removed, because it was put on. It'll just take some cutting to remove it, that's all.

The giants voice was stern and horrible. The arm was part of him, the flesh wound through the bionics like it would normal bone. The arm was not just a prosthetic limb. It was more than that. The prostheses that ran through him were not attached to his body... they were his body. As was the armor not worn over his skin... it was his skin. A true machination of life.

The giant followed the farghul without hesitation. For being so small she was one of the bravest. Though she was angry more often than not it seemed... as to why he could not tell. Anger though was a powerful ally it was that anger that helped this tiny creature tugging at his arm bring down even one such as he. The giant turned his attention to the wookie for only a moment at the threat. "If i was going to attack... I would long ago have attempted." The giant pointed to the clawed arm which the small farghul had hold of. "Use your wits... hiding behind threats does not show bravery... only foolishness."

Aymaric examines the material that was mixed with Sarin's arm and skin. The metal was unlike anything he had ever seen before. It seemed relatively lightweight, but extremely durable. It would likely deflect most bludgeoning. He couldn't put a name to it though.
The group rounds up and moves out of the freezing storage room. They walk past the charred bodies down the hallway they were previously in. The stink from the corpses filling their noses. It smelled like a bad barbecue of sorts.
The group reenters the expansive lobby area of the Falsoor headquarters. Feldon and Lues were standing near the center console reception desk. It seems they were fiddling with the computers to no avail. They were engaged in small talk. They spot the humongous being and the Selkath quickly.

The blonde-haired Jedi Knight with his white robes walks forward of the desk to speak with Qwy.
Feldon: "I'm afraid we're not from Falsoor. We're Jedi Knights and these others are with the Republic. I know you work with a third party organization. We can't really tell you too much about what we are doing here. But we are on here on a rescue mission. Do you seek aid?"
Meanwhile, as the group walked through the door...Aymaric catches something of interest on one of the charred corpses in the hallway. It was a woman he talked to a lot back in the "Test Tube" cantina. He had courted her for a while and was growing to like her. She still was in possession of the silver bracelet he had given to her. It was shining brightly despite the blackness of her burned body. There was no mistaking who it was. This attack on Colony P-57 had definitely taken its toll. Aymaric pondered whether he should leave the item amongst the dead or take it as a keepsake.

Qwy aas starlted to hear that jedi knights existed and was on this planet of all places. He had only heard rumors of these werid mystics who call on what was that called again...a ha the force.

Qwy quickly scans the room in a very detailed manner. He searches from the ground up. The turbolift tubes in the right corner of the room were shut, but he couldn't see anything next to them. The four double doorways had nothing around them. The small amount of legless tables protruding from the walls had nothing but flimsiplast documents. There was nothing of interest besides these things he saw.
The Jedi seemed honest in his mannerisms and speech. Almost completely genuine. Qwy felt quite sharp about his perception of this person as well.

Qwy took in his surroundings with such a level of detail that he saw a flea jump from the wookiee to the cat like species. The human who claimed to be a jedi was telling the truth as far as Qwy could tell and it was nice to hear it from someone on this rock finally.
Qwy: "Well Jedi of blond hair I think I am search of new employeement as this facility is in no longer need of my unique abilities. If you would like I can lend a hand to this party as a token of apprecation to helping me. I've never seen a jedi but from the stoires ive heard they are unstoppable...except for the tall dark dude who hunted them and all. Any information you can give me might help me grasp the situation from your stand point and where I can lend a hand."
Qwy whispers to the blond jedi: "Might want to watch the cat seems to have bit of a temper for a jedi if you ask me."

The young Jedi knight brushes his hair to the side as it was quite messy from the rain and such. He hadn't bathed properly since they've been on Vjun.
Feldon: "Most of this colony is in shambles if you haven't noticed. We've found a few survivors such as yourself. The survivors have been the ones with the means to defend themselves. We haven't found anyone else fortunate to be alive without weapons. Whoever did this was targeting anybody and everybody. How exactly did you survive this anyways? Lock yourself into a room?"
The Jedi Master looks around the room and then turns to Sarin.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "So, we're giving you safe passage out of Vjun at least. It's very dangerous around here. Although you may seek death, I sense you want to die when you are ready.

The giant turned to face his questioner. "As i have spoken of before... i came in search of this dark power... to therefore increase my own." "All i came to find though was this rabble." His voice was always horrible, terrifying even in its softest tone. "I do not know of the one... of whom you speak." His voice was silenced again and only the hiss of the respirator could be heard again. He returned his gaze to the fore to continue following the young farghul.

Aymaric was growing tired of arguing with someone who didn't seem to understand the techniques involved with his own cybernetic implants, so he let it go. He then turns his attention to the cylinders and decides there really is no way to keep them as cold as the storage room and whatever was in them would probably be destroyed if he kept them. So, he removed them from the makeshift container and put them back on the shelf.
After completing his cylinder task, the Falsoor security guard or maybe former security guard, he wasn't sure yet, follows the group out of the cold storage room. The hallway stank of a Chubba roast gone bad, the charred bodies looking very much like burnt Chubba sausage. As he slowly walks through the hallway deciding if he should move the bodies to the cold storage room or just let them continue to rot and fester, a shiny bauble catches his eye. It was the bracelet he had given to Rathoth, the cute little Bothan, a small tuft of blue dyed fur still remaining on the skull was an additional indication as well. Bending down to take the bracelet and making sure no one was looking, "Well sweetie, you died how you always wanted to, surrounded by lots of people and burning up in the heat of passion." The self satisfying smirk on his face accompanies the bracelet as it is being twirled on his left index finger when he finally enters the lobby. There is a brief moment of reflection on what might have been, but it is quickly dismissed as pointless. Then remembering where he was and who he was with, he quickly pockets the bracelet while continuing towards the group. "So what's the plan? Continue exploring rooms in this building and collecting more refugees, or make like a Sith and scurry on outta here?"

Aymaric notices the tiny words inscribed in Basic on the bracelet, "Love never dies." Rathoth had talked with Aymaric about that many times in the past; that love may be hard to find, but once its found true love never dies. He pockets the bracelet, feeling a bit more enlightened in a curious manner.

Awne's ear twitches at an itch and the various conversations. She shakes her head and sighs, her mind was in too many places to focus completely, what's more her emotions weren't helping; she wasn't even angry anymore, and couldn't figure out why she was upset to begin with.
Shaking her head, her tail flicks lightly. Watching the new addition curiously..well..the one that she wasn't holding onto still; ancients knew she wasn't about to let the giant leave or try and hurt her friends. She looks up at the giant then over to the other...what was he anyway...and back again. "Stay." she points to the ground and gives the giant a pointed look. Looking to the wookiee, she motions her head to the giant in a way of silently saying 'watch him' while she moved to the other male "Alrright therre?"

He turned to look at the wookie his stare only lasting for a brief second. The giant then turned his attention back to the small woman and stood his place.

Shortly after arriving at the lobby desk where everyone else was at, Aymaric has a feeling of lightheadedness and mild euphoria. He quickly becomes worried when he realizes that his hand was in his pocket. He thinks to himself *"Did I leave a syringe in my pocket?!"*. He slowly pulls his hand out of his pocket and is relieved to see only the bracelet in his hand. An overwhelming urge to put the bracelet on is defeated by a much more powerful need to not wear a womans bracelet. He quickly puts the bracelet back in his pocket and focuses on the conversations that are going on.

Sarin... finally tired of the ruse he was playing and sick of his meaningless existence reached to his chest and tore out the life support keeping him alive. As gurgles and coughs could be heard the machinery began to spark and struggle. Sarin, unable to breath and with no machinery to keep his heart beating fell to the floor, dark corrupted blood spilled forth from the hole in his chest and the giants body fell lifeless. His pain was finally gone. He would suffer no more. He could find some manner of peace at last.....

Woroken watched the giant attempt to rend the machinery from what was left of the man. Thinking of the information he might still have that could help the group, the wookiee grabs the human by the arm, even as he begins gasping, and begins to feel the man's pain and almost suction it out, as he substitutes the healing power of the Force for the cold despair of the human. "Focus," he reminds himself as he attempts to heal the human, and at least keep him alive until the mechanically inclined members of the team could help.

Feldon rushes over to the side of Sarin's fallen body. He works alongside the Wookiee desperately to preserve the troubled man's life. The Jedi Knight hands Woroken a medkit, but as the Wookiee opens it, Feldon nods his head in a sad realization. Both Jedi were aware that the twisted metal and natural body parts were too complicated to fix due in part of the respirator ripped out. It would be impossible for them to save him with the equipment they had on hand. Feldon is the first to stand up, he places his hand's on the Wookiee's shoulder.
Feldon: "After all that, this man will never know what it's like to live a life without suffering. I hope he finds what he wants as he becomes one with the Force."

Looking around at the lump of machine and man Vor'en feel alittle remorse for the man. More of like seeing the passage of an enemy after a great battle.
"Sierra Main. The prisoner just took his own life over. Will not be proceeding with the prisoner over. Proceeding with info gathering will be moving out soon. Red Seven out."

Awne glances to the now dead body of the giant, she didn't know him, and after the loss of her two 'cubs' she didn't feel much of anything in the ways of remorse. He wanted to die back when he was subdued, maybe now he'd rest easily. Glancing to where she clipped the giants lightsaber beside her own she hums lightly, seems she didn't need to steal it after all.
Holding a hand out to the fish man in offering to help him up she grins lightly "Come on, no use sitting arround herre alone, might as well join in on ourr mission and add in what you can to help us."

Vor'en's helmet crackles back in his ear.
Sierra Main: "That's a solid copy on the prisoner transfer. Continue with the information, but be mindful of Knight 7 (Mur Eva). Sierra Main out."
Vor'en cuts the comm and rolls his camo down to check his chrono. They were now fifteen hours and 35 minutes into the 48 hour mission.
The whole reception room seemed to have an eerie feel of death. The Dark Side was beginning to saturate everyone's body like a sponge soaking up water drops. Eventually, the death and constant battling would prove a challenging test for the Jedi. Could they keep their morals afloat while facing the cold reality of combat? In all the events, it seemed people had not been too concerned with Radon.
The Jedi Master clips his lightsaber to his belt.
Master Lorhas: "May the Force become one with him. Everyone, keep your mind focused on the mission...what just happened was the past. The past has no purpose to you right now. We must excel for the good of the present and future."
Lues Van seems a bit troubled after witnessing this event. He sits behind the reception desk, blankly typing at the computer keys.
The Farghul Jedi examined the large lightsaber. It had a glossy black finish and a bright red activation switch. It seemed to be heavy, as if to use gravity to pull the weapon down in a swing. Perhaps if it could be appraised, Awne could learn the extent of its power, as it seemed to be a rare lightsaber type. *Knowledge Technology (trained only).*

Awne, however, can sense that Jes Mur Eva is still conscious far away from this place. Although she couldn't determine anywhere close to where she was; the Farghul felt she was definitely not in the HQ building.

The 9320/B Sensor Pack on Vor'en's belt begins beeping. The sound breaks the eerie silence of the low-light reception room. Vor'en looks on the green screen and sees that there is a life form that is actively moving. It was about 50 meters away. From what Vor'en could guess, it was coming from the double doors opposite the entrance. There was no telling what the life form was. Whatever it was, it was coming straight for Red Team.

The Wookiee got right next to the door as Team one moved directly in front of it. Vor'en carefully approaches the double doors as Lance and Aymaric cover him first hand. They halt 1.5 meters away from the door and realize they were not close enough to trigger the automated opening of the doors. The three armed blastermen were square to the door.

Team 1 and Vor'en waits about a meter away from the door. They were at the ready for whatever was on the other side to trigger the double-doors. Vor'en watches the sensor screen closely as the life form stops in front of the door. The door did not open. After a few seconds the life form turns around and begins walking away from the group. It was likely moving around in the hallway just beyond the doors they were facing.

Vor'en and Team 1 move through the doubles door. They appear in a hallway much like the one that led to the cold storage room. This hallway seemed to be a little darker, as the emergency lighting in here wasn't as strong. There were doors along the moderately-wide hallway as the one before. The ceiling was quite low however. No one could see any life forms in the area as of now. Vor'en recognized that the life form was about 30 meters from him. The group thought about moving deeper into the hall to get a closer look.

Vor'en and Lance can't see anything in the relative low-light conditions. Even though the target was registering on the sensor, they couldn't see too well through the dark. Perhaps in their anticipation they weren't focusing on one area well enough to see the life form.

Aymaric scans the the hallway with perfect illumination. He looks in the direction of the position of the life form displayed by Vor'en's sensor pack. Surprisingly, he only saw a small creature scurrying about the hall floor. It was definitely not a hostile creature. It was of a very tiny size. There was no doubt that the life form reading on the sensor was this being.

This could be an example of the life forms that escaped the containment cells. Like I said earlier, I didn't spend much time in this part of the complex."

Turning his attention to Vor'en. "Well Sergeant, the console in the lobby here is the only computer I have any real access to." Looking down at the floor with a slight expression of hesitation and shame, then looking back up at Vor'en "Also, I can't help you gain access to anymore information on the projects Falsoor is doing here, actually none of us can(indicating the other Falsoor employees).

Feldon leans up against the center console and speaks out quietly to those standing around him.
Feldon: "I hope coming into this building was worth it. So far we've just found a bunch of stuff that is of no use to us. It's kind of hard to believe we found illegal weaponry on them so long ago on Nar Shaddaa. We aren't finding any leads of that kind as of now."

Sierra Main: "Remember the damaged inertial dampers on the freighter? I've repaired it enough to give us no problems on the egress from Vjun. I tweaked a few other things as well, it should run pretty good. In the meantime, I'm going to scout the local humans I saw earlier. If it arouses enough interest, you should check it out on your way to Knight Seven (Mur Eva). I'll get back to you Red."
The com transmission cuts out. The men begin forming a line next to the reception console. All of their weapons seemed to be good. There were some minor rust spots from the acid rain but nothing major. It would have likely caused more damage if they had been exposed to the harsh Vjun elements longer. They were green on their equipment. Vor'en thought in the back of his mind that he was thankful someone picked up the blaster cannon. It would be a necessity against anti-vehicle targets. The light repeater and blaster cannon were the bread-and-butter to his squad. It was almost as important as his leadership.

With a look of glee that only a child in a candy store could compete with, and a rubbing of the hands that makes you think of an old holovid villain, Aymaric moves to the body of the deceased giant. "An hour hmm? Plenty of time." After laying out a body bag, a bio hazard container, and assorted medical tools, the medic dons a disposable surgical mask and gloves. A contented hum of a popular song eminates from the red headed young man as he begins to slice away the flesh and muscle to get at the cybernetic limb underneath. "Humm hum hum humm humm hum hum..."
Forty five minutes of slicing and wrenching provides a container of blood and a cybernetic limb, which are then wrapped up and put in his medical kit.

Vor'en scopes out the heading they were about to travel. There was a vast clearing that led into a saddle of rocky hills. The saddle led to the bottom of a cliff. It was likely they would be crossing another mountain if they continued in that direction. The unit assembles in formation as Lues walks past the HQ. The colony didn't stretch past the HQ.

The unit proceeds on the relatively flat, rocky surface. Indeed, they had their movement cut out for them. But at the very least, the rain had stopped and all they had to endure was the wind whipping across the area. They were walking in the cover of the dark, so anything without low-light capabilities would have difficulty spotting them. Earlier, the *Starshade* had flew over head to the east. Presumably to check out the group of humans Sierra Main had informed Vor'en about.
Woroken felt confident in the Force feeding him information. It was a constant flow of reminder that they were getting closer to their long lost Jedi friend. She seemed to be in good health at the moment, maybe just slightly distressed. Lues was pointing the group in the right direction. Woroken could feel it would not be too much longer.
Vor'en's helmet comlink chirps with an incoming message. He presses the ear of his helmet to activate the transmission.
Sierra Main: "Red Seven, about 2 kilometers east of your position, I've located the group of humans. I flew in low and I have something strange to report. None of the humans reacted to me whatsoever, they have such a blank stare to them. There is at least a hundred of them."
A considerably loud thump can be heard over the radio.
Sierra Main: "Agh, I'm having atmospheric thruster problems. I must have crossed the wrong wires when I was working on the freighter earlier. I'm going to set her down and take a look. Do you want to check out the group on your way to Mur Eva?"

Aymaric attempts to get a better glimpse. He had to look hard to notice anything about the person. The being approaching was simply too far to get a detailed look at. They would have to wait until the person got closer.

Qwy can't see too much detail with his rifle scope. So he brings his weapon down and awaits something to happen. He glances around the unit to see everyone patiently waiting. In this darkness it would be particularly easy to doze-off. Hopefully, every person in this unit was still alert.
With a eerie calmness, the man finally reaches the group. He looks around with his rifle pointing towards the ground. The human male was very unattractive by human standards. His clothing was rugged but tactical. The person seemed incredibly agile and strong, as if he could push through everyone and outrun them. He speaks with a very non-caring attitude.

According to Lues, they had a good walk towards Mur Eva. The vague information from the Jedi was undoubtedly disheartening; as no one was sure how much longer they had to go to get to her.
The group continued to step towards their objective. They were encountering jagged rocks, mud, and various other elements of difficult terrain. How much time was the mission going to demand of Red Team?

The unit keeps their weapons at a low-alert posture as they continue their movement. Everyone had got a decent amount of sleep, but that didn't stop everyone from beginning to feel fatigue anyways.
The terrain they were crossing was low but bothersome with rocks scattered throughout. The group was moving swiftly regardless, as if their patience had wore thin to find the Jedi. Lues Van had continued to look behind him as he was leading the way to the target area. After traveling a good kilometer and a half south, elevated terrain could be seen within view to the front. It seems the hills, rocks, and slopes were leading to a crop of tall/thick mountains. Lues halts the unit and everyone faces outward for security reasons.
Lues approaches Sergeant Vor'en.

"Ya, I think they might be. I was hopeing to aviod anymore trouble but, we should check it out. Aymaric, can you pick if any of the people in that group are from Falsoor? I want to do this from a safe distance." Vor'en didn't see any harm in checking on it. If they needed help he didn't want leave a group of civilains out in the wild on his consance.

Master Lorhas listens to Woroken and responds politely.
Lorhas: "Well Padawan, I believe the Sergeant has made up his mind. We are going to check on these people. Perhaps they are in trouble? After all, what would people be doing out here in the open anyways?"
With that, Lues Van stands up and then Sergeant Vor'en motions for everyone to get up. Squirts seemed to be a bit uncertain about the situation as the unit moved out. Lues gets to the point of the formation and continues on towards the unknown people. The unit moves roughly 500 meters south before coming up to a hill that seemed like it faded into a plateau.
The Jedi Knight signaled this was the correct way as everyone began moving up the steep earth. Once the group climbs about 40 meters, the ground evened out and was flat for miles. The plateau turned into mountains directly right of the group. Lues halts the group, everyone fans out for security.
The long haired Jedi Knight approaches Vor'en as he is kneeling in the center of the formation.
Lues Van: "I can sense the people near, but I am having trouble seeing them in the darkness. Aymaric suggested we scout the area with binos...anyone have them? Ask your men. By the way, this mountain range to our east will lead to Mur Eva. After we check out these people, shouldn't take us long to get moving through the cliffs."

Awne uses this lapse in maneuvers to perform disassembly of the fallen person's lightsaber. She concentrates through the Force to assist her in taking apart the trademark/symbolic weapon of the Jedi. As the Farghul closes her eyes, the hilt begins coming apart cleanly as it is levitating in the air.
The blade emitter detaches from the hilt. Then the blade energy channel is exposed. The focusing crystal neatly pops out as the metal encasing opens up. The blade's handgrip spreads apart; dropping the power cell in front of her. She grabs what is left of the handgrip, pulling out the purple Nextor crystal. The weapon was now disassembled. No doubt, the weapon could take great amount of time to put together again. She stored all the parts in her robes. *You no longer receive the weapon's bonuses/penalties.

Lues Van chuckles at the Sergeant.
Lues Van: "Use your sensor pack."
The Staff Sergeant brings the screen up from his belt. It seemed the Jedi Master was right. There was about 5-7 life forms 70 meters to their front...and a massive amount of blips 30 meters from them. They were just beyond the hill were they couldn't see. The life forms didn't appear to be moving much. It seemed that's all the information Vor'en could get. He would have to make a decision from here.

He falls out of eyesight to the hill line and slides down the dirt toward Vor'en. A few dust particles hit Vor'en in the face. He whispers to the Sergeant.
Lues: "I count 8 individuals just beyond this hill. They all have some type of item in their hands, looks like they could be used as weapons. There is one female who looks to be quite young. I'd say in her teens. They are just standing there. I can't sense ANYTHING from them. I don't think they saw us. We shouldn't be spotted if we don't cross that hilltop. What's the call?"

Awne goes from a bipedal human posture, to a low feline-like stance. She gracefully scales the hill and looks over the top. Indeed, there were a group of humans about 15 meters away from her. Their clothes seemed rather ragged, but a few of them looked like Falsoor uniforms. Some of them were similar to what Aymaric was wearing. A young girl was indeed among the group. They were all human. They seemed to be standing around; indifferent to everything, staring into space. The group didn't seem to notice the Farghul.

From a Jedi's compassionate point-of-view, I'd say establish contact with them. If its dangerous, we'll pull out quickly. They weren't heavily armed it seemed, but they have numbers. However, this is not our main objective. But...if you want to link up with them, I'll be the one to do it. Only send me...have your men ready to withdraw. But the Republic makes the call on this."

Awne was cursing up a storm in various languages, mostly Farghul with a hint of English thrown in and a few others.  Climbing back up the hill she looks to those that were on the attack path to her friend and masters;  shifting to bring her hand up, she focuses on the force to push the people back into eachother, she didn't want to hurt them..yet.

Awne responds to the orders from Staff Sergeant Vor'en. She reluctantly sprints toward the direction that Lues and Feldon were heading in. They were making a break towards the sloping geography they would have to climb. The Jedi were head on towards the mountains.
Back on top of the plateau, the charging humans were closing distance quickly with the Jedi Master and the Staff Sergeant. After about a good 22 meter dash, the group of people were adjacent and amassed in front of Vor'en. It seems they were attracted to his blaster shot. Both men quickly note they were growling, grumbling, and moaning inhumanely. They had various weapons in their hands ranging from knives, rocks, and sticks. The people were dirty and their clothes shaggy. Some of the humans were raising their arms in an attack posture. It would not be hard to hit the humans as they were right in their face, it was just a matter of picking the targets.
Team 1 consisting of Lance and Sav seemed to disobey orders. They trudged up the terrain towards the Jedi Master and Sgt Vor'en. They were anxious to fight.
Aymaric watches as Team 1 ran up the hill. He was not going to rush into this fight against orders. Despite not being in the Republic unit, he was following orders better. He walked slightly up the inclined ground and faced opposite of the Jedi Master's location. Indeed, he could not see any threats to the rear of the group...but he was effectively covering the unit's backside. Gor 'Ak was useful in aiding Aymaric as he was watching the left flank of the hill.
Now the unit had been broken into 4 elements. The Jedi and Awne had taken off towards the cliff to effectively escape. Gor and Aymaric had resided at the bottom of the hill to cover the unit's retreat. Squirts, Lance, Sav, Qwy, and Woroken were rushing to aid Lorhas and Vor'en against orders. And of course, the Jedi Master and Vor were trying to push back the 8 attackers in fear that the other life forms might become aggressive. This situation could become worse without careful action.

Qwy was not one to fly into battle without knowing the battles course of action. The fact that he was doing all he could to keep pace with the wookiee left the poor selkath pushing his limits. While running up the slope Qwy couldnt help but notice that he and the others were out in the open being bogged down, running to two men who where standing their ground instead of falling back to the rest of their group. If he didn't know any better Qwy could swear that the group was being split on purpose. (Knowledge (tactics) +10 to see if Qwy can asses the battle)
Dropping to one knee Qwy takes up position to cover Woro and the others as they ascend the hill. (Perception +8 to look around for flankers)

Qwy took a knee on the side of the hill. He saw the others breaking for the mountainside on the flat ground at the bottom of the slope. They were heading east. The others who were running with Qwy were going to help the Jedi and Vor'en. It seemed this battle was going to have threefronts. Those fighting, those covering, and those retreating. Confusion could set in as some members seemed to be disobeying the order to retreat. Lorhas and Vor'en wanted to hold the enemy off so the others wouldn't be seen by them. They wanted to keep the rest of the group's identity concealed. Qwy could see no one on the hill, nor could he see anyone around the flat area at the bottom. Everything seemed clear, and the others had a straight shot to the mountains. At least as far as the Selkath could tell.

Feldon and Lues slowed their sprint down. They walked a few steps ahead and stopped. They turned around to see Awne running towards their position. Feldon shouted out towards the other on the hill.
Feldon: "Are you guys coming?!"
On top the plateau, Jedi Master Lorhas watches the attackers intently as they brandished their weapons to strike at him and Vor'en. It seemed he was waiting for them to make the first move.

Vor'en takes a step back from the enemy that was right in his face. He brings his weapon up to eye level and fires a quick two shots. The shots were quite hurried in response to the enemy's charge. In effect, the two rounds glance past the man's shoulder. He had missed the enemy at close range. The man appeared to be wielding a small knife in Vor'en's direction. The savage individuals seemed to be aggressive towards the sound of the Sergeant's blaster carbine.

Awne takes pause in her run, looking back to the others and more so towards where she heard a blaster, no..no this wasn't working anymore.  Looking up to the two Jedi, she gives an apologetic look even if they couldn't see it, and turns to run back down the hill.  Orders or no Orders she wasn't going to lose someone else.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-01-29 13:49:15)

Awne follows Feldon and Lues as the feeling that the plan wasn't going to work overwhelms her. She stops in place and runs back toward the base of the hill. She was eager to get back to Vor'en. As she stopped in front of the hill, she looked up and realized that this would be a nice run to get to their position.
On top the plateau, the man who was just shot at directly retaliates toward Vor'en. He jabs his vibroblade forward and hit Vor in the chest armor. The shock from the hit shook Vor up slightly.*Vor'en takes 6 damage.*
The Jedi Master responds to the attack by the blade wielding maniac toward Vor'en by using the Force. He quickly gestures his hand to the front of him and the vibroblade individual is tossed 1 meter violently into the other two savages behind him. They are all knocked over like a domino effect as limbs went flying in the air madly. The barbaric men are unable to keep their balance and all 3 people fall prone.

A woman in a ragged dress rushes toward the front of Vor'en following the attack by the Jedi Master. She has a vibroblade and she lashes out with a growl. The blade brushes past Vor's right arm, opening a small gash on his bicep. *14 damage.* Almost simultaneously, a burly man is at Vor's right side. The savage is swinging a club like weapon at him wildly. The Sergeant is able to dodge the blows well enough to avoid a hit.
Beside Vor'en, the other three crazed people surround the Jedi Master. The young girl grabs at him with her hands but the Jedi easily gets out of the way. Someone with a vibro-ax lunges at Lorhas, but he promptly ducks under the jab. From all three human attackers, none of the people could hit the incredibly quick Jedi.
The people who were knocked over got up and were now surrounding the Jedi as well. But the other enemies were blocking their way to the Jedi. These enemies seemed to have no concept of loss of life or limb, as they were still eagerly attacking a man who was easily evading their blows.
Back at the base of the hill, Aymaric backs up a bit so he can clearer at the crest of the hill. He could see the others still sprinting up the sloped terrain to reach their friends. It seemed like a slightly winding run.

"If you have to fight at all costs, at least cross over to this side of the hill and give us something to shoot at!"
Training his rifle at the top of the hill, he takes a deep breath to steady himself, and closes his eyes for a short moment, focusing only on the combat at hand.

Gor 'Ak walks up the hill a bit while trying to keep his mind open to any threats around. He couldn't really feel the situation too well. So the only enemy that he thought was around were the ones engaged with the Jedi and Vor'en. He doubted his instincts at the moment. There were no targets to engage either, they were all on top of the plateau.

Woroken continues the sprint up the hill. The soft dirt was making it difficult to climb up the terrain. His feet sank deep into the ground and it was cumbersome to pick his legs back up. IT would take many seconds of running to get to his comrades who have endured the hardships of Vjun with him.

Qwy realizes that it would be important to follow the leader in this ordeal, though he was constantly guessing what to do next. He reluctantly slid the short distance down the hill and began running towards the mountainside. Qwy began running toward Feldon and Lues who were standing still.
The group was effectively becoming a mob, with people heading in different directions with no real coordination. Order had dissolved. One can only hope that the enemy was less effective than its opposition.
Lues and Feldon seemed to be shouting to the others rushing the hill to follow them. They only moved a short distance and stopped in their tracks. They seemed hesitant to move as it seemed they didn't want to leave anyone behind. The roguish warrior Squirts had now caught up with the Jedi as well. They didn't seem too far from the sloping terrain that formed into the mountains. The mountains needed to be crossed to advance toward their objective.

Vor'en looks at the man with the club swinging at him. The big person definitely seemed like a threat, like he could cave Vor's skull in with one bash of that weapon. Vor'en swiveled his hips and blaster carbine to mid-level of the man's chest. He fired a quick two shots to the center mass of the man. There was no missing at this range.
The two bolts slapped the man's chest hard. The person shouted in pain as he grabbed the searing holes in his torso. He fell over...and was not moving. The club had fallen at his side. The woman attacking Vor'en didn't even care that her fellow attacker was down. She just kept the vibroblade brandished in his direction with no signs of surrender.

The Farghul apprentice looks up to the plateau. The attackers were no doubt giving the men trouble as she had just heard blasterfire. The Jedi and Sergeant were likely occupying the enemy so the whole unit wouldn't be spotted and bogged down in a needless fight. One would have to hope that those two could handle the opposition by themselves. She knew Master Lorhas was an extremely skilled warrior...most Jedi were for that matter. She had made her mind to disregard orders and continue up the hill toward the plateau. She took off running up the rest of the distance toward her compatriots. The slippery dirt under her feet was making it difficult to move though.

The small crowd of savage meleers continue to swarm the Jedi Master at the top of the plateau. Vibroblades, hands, and a club were being swung at him wildly. A club blew cleanly over the man as he ducked swiftly. He then sidestepped a jabbing blade and backed up slightly. A woman lunged at him with her hands and Lorhas used his forearms to parry the grab attempt. He was easily evading the attacks until the young girl jumped at the man and clawed at his tunic with her bare hands. She manage to rip his tunic slightly and cut him with her fingernails. The Jedi grimaced slightly as he delivered a back-handed fist to bat her away. He then used the Force to push the girl into the other attackers. Knocking her and the club-wielder over.
While this was occuring, the last standing man next to Vor'en threw a fist at his face. Vor managed to move to the right and dodge the blow. It would seem that these attackers had no intention of yielding an inch, nor did it seem like they would listen to reason.

Gor 'Ak scanned the hill around him quickly. The quickest way to the top would no doubt to run straight up. There were no shortcuts to the top, as the sloping terrain was just a troublesome everywhere else. He continues to proceed up the hill through the unstable dirt, trying hard not to lose his footing. His instincts were telling him that no other enemy was in the area, other than the ones on top of the plateau. He watched as Woroken seemed to be the closest one to the top. He was sprinting quickly despite the annoying slope; Squirts was right next to the charging Wookiee's side.
Sgt. Vor'en's sensor pack continued to beep as life forms were approaching them.
Feldon and Lues had stopped completely, awaiting their friends who were retreating with them.
Lues had grown annoyed at the events occuring, but he couldn't yell out at the group. He tried to signal to the others rushing the plateau.

He lined the front sight tip on the chest of the woman as she was rearing back for another lunge with her blade. Vor'en squeezed the trigger and his carbine did the unthinkable, it did not discharge a blaster bolt. He squeezed again frantically and yet again no shot.

The others who had been knocked over by the Jedi stood up quickly. The young girl rushed the Jedi Master savagely after having got back up on her feet. She tried to grab the Jedi but he dodged by sidestepping her. A brute with his vibroaxe slashed at the Jedi's knee, cutting him slightly as he was unable to dodge. He was then punched in the back of the head by another man as the Jedi instinctively grabbed his leg. Lorhas stood up straight and reasserted himself by dodging the rest of blows from the seven relentless attackers. Vor'en could tell they were trying to kill him, even the little girl was trying. Luckily, the Jedi Master was nimble on his feet and was evading most of the attacks.
The Jedi holds back his emerald lightsaber in a defensive stance as he digs his feet into the ground. He extends his hand and touches the head of the young girl clawing at him. The young girl screams violently and runs through the mob toward the hill. She was retreating and no longer attacking Lorhas.
Aymaric realized what was happening and began to run uphill like the others. More and more people were rushing to the fight uptop. He found it difficult to sprint though, as each footfall sank deep into the loose dirt of the slope.
*It is now Gor Ak's turn, followed by Woroken. Aymaric is 68 squares from the top of the plateau where Vor and Lorhas are meleeing.*

"Everyone but you are clear now sarge. We have position near the bottom of the hill, so if youÂ´d just please haul your backside over here we can cover you as well, there are people just on the other side ready to help out as well, so just do it"
Once again dropping to a kneeling stance, Gor decided to settle there.
"Aymaric! We halt here until they get back over the ridge. When theyÂ´re clear, we hose it, you copy? That should give us at least a momentary respite"

Gor took a knee and looked toward the top of the hill. He saw the Wookiee taking the lead to get to the battle first.
Woroken could feel the anticipation of battle as he was nearing the top. His lean legs pumped furiously to get to his master. Just a little bit longer. He could hear the sounds of growling attackers and a thrumming lightsaber. His master was indeed locked in combat.
*Gor where did I last say you were located an the hill? I had you at 57 squares away from the top of the plateau, which wouldn't be the bottom. It is now Qwy's turn, followed by Vor'en. Woro is now 16 squares from the top.*

Qwy continues to run away from the fighting atop the plateau. The rough rock on the red Vjun ground made it difficult not to sprain an ankle as he moved. Within seconds, he caught up to Feldon and Lues. The two Jedi Knights were waiting for the others to join the retreat.
Lues spoke to Qwy...

Qwy responding to Lues...
"I'm not sure if they are coming. Most of them are rushing to battle to save their friends. Noble in some aspects but arrogant in that they are wasting the chance of escape those two tried to provide." Qwy speaks with no disrespect as he says these words only with a heavy heart that he chose to follow orders instead of his wookie friend.
Qwy drops to a knee and lines up his rifle scope on the hilltop if he can get a clear shot he won't hesitate to take it.

## Re: Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-02-11 23:13:00)

Vor'en quickly changes hands of his carbine and reaches for his holster. He draws his blaster pistol and fires at the woman who had been attacking him for a few moments now. However, Vor'en was too shaky and unstable as he drew the weapon. The blaster bolt shot right of the woman as she reared back for another lunge. She attempted to grab Vor's face but missed. *48/50 rounds left on your pistol.*
Awne kept her eyes focused to the hilltop as she heard another blaster shot. Woroken seemed to be getting closer to the crest and her legs felt a slight tingle as she pumped them through the soft dirt. *42 squares from the top for Awne.* Awne caught the sight of a little girl running down the hill a little bit to the left of the Wookiee. She was screaming in agony and looked as if she was darting towards the bottom. The girl lost her footing and slid down the hill a bit and stopped.
In the melee crowd with the Jedi Master, he continued to do his best to stay a step ahead of the enemy. A club swung hard at the Jedi, striking him in the side of face and stunning him. Lorhas then retaliated by swiping at the clubman's arms. Both arms were severed cleanly as the man yelped in pain. The club arm fell to the ground, useless. The human who had attacked with the weapon then crumpled over. The Jedi then spun around and brought his lightsaber down toward the kneecaps of a man wielding a vibroblade. His legs were cut cleanly into stumps and he fell to the ground. The man still tried to stab Lorhas but was ineffective. The knife wielder was thrashing about violently and helplessly in the dirt. He was frothing at the mouth to attack the Jedi.
Meanwhile, at the bottom of the hill, Lance and Sav kept their weapons pointing to the ground. They were watching the rear flank of the hill, since everyone else was oriented up. They were doing their job with discipline as they knew that all sectors had to be covered.
*It is now Aymaric's turn, followed by Gor Ak's.*

"What the...!" The tiny form of a small child wailing like a stuck Wampa as it ran down the hill, then tripping and tumbling to a stop, was not what Aymaric had expected to see coming from the fight at the top of the hill.  Lowering his blaster rifle and turning in the direction of the downed girl, the one-time Republic Medic starts a sprint in her direction.

Aymaric proceeds further up the hill from the base of where he was standing. The girl was nearly at the top of the plateau. It would take some seconds to reach her, especially with the sinking dirt that he had to run through.
While Vor'en was squaring off with the woman who had a vibroblade, he heard his sensorpack emit a loud beep. This was letting him know that some lifeforms were approaching from their south. That was Lorhas' and Vor's twelve o' clock. Did he have time to look at his sensor screen?

"Trust me Aymaric, that girl is the least of the problem! You are supposed to be following orders and stay with Lues.

By now Woroken's lungs were about to burst.  He had been moving uphill as quickly as he could for a good long time now.  Just as he approached the top of the hill, he noticed the young girl come down in the opposite direction.  As she slipped to the ground, he momentarily paused, deciding on whether to assist her, or whether to crest the plateau.  He adjusted his path slightly and moved in the girl's direction.  Master Lorhas and Vor'en would be okay for a few moments longer, he was sure.

The Wookiee keeps his attention on the young girl. He continued on direction towards her. He was almost there, he was also near the top of the plateau. A Jedi must help those in need. It was a part of respecting life of all forms. Lorhas had instructed him countless times on the value of life. *You are 10 squares from the young girl. It is Qwy's turn.*

While not waiting for an answer Qwy will scout the hill looking for any of the attackers to flank.

The blonde haired Jedi Knight scans the area. He seemed ready to move out any second. Him and Feldon were kneeling in the dirt slightly. It seemed to Qwy they were waiting for the others to catch up for the escape.
Lues Van: "Yes there is a purpose. They are buying us time to get away in case there is more enemies than we can handle."
Qwy looks around to the plateau where the fighting was going on. He could see nothing past the ridge line. Whatever was going on it was out of sight. He looked over to east where the mountains were at. Qwy couldn't notice anything over there either. They were safe from combat for certain.

Vor'en realigned his pistol sights on the woman despite the fact that he had missed previously. He discharged yet another shot and the bolt collided with the woman's stomach. She dropped immediately into the dirt. She was not moving. No one else was attacking the soldier now. Vor'en changed his glance to the group of 3 surrounding Master Lorhas. It seemed all the hostiles had been mostly dealt with. The Jedi Master looked very comfortable dealing with his enemies. The sergeant could catch a slight breather.
Vor'en backpedaled down the plateau slightly. Anyone who was scrambling up the hill could now see the veteran moving downwards slowly.
*It is now Awne's turn.*

Awne looks up at the sight of the soldier backing down the hill and growls, oh he was so going to get it when she got her hands on him. Clenching her hands into fits she moves more determinedly upward, using her hands to help her climb.
*yup, still running up the blasted hill*

---

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-02-20 01:04:48)

Vor'en's sensor pack continued to beep louder as life forms were rapidly approaching them. The life forms were no doubt moving double their speed. Something was in a rush to meet them, and it was at least 100-110 creatures. They seemed to be closing on the position were they where fighting on the plateau.
Awne was determined with each footfall to reach the top where the battle was occurring. She was still invigorated as of now; with any luck she'd keep this pace. *You are 30 squares from the top. 29 squares away from Vor'en.*
While fighting on the plateau, Master Lorhas dodged a vibro-ax swinging downwards to him. He leaped atop the handle of the weapon as it struck the ground. The man had got the weapon trapped in the dirt. The Jedi balanced on the ax as he brought his lightsaber blade down upon the burly man's head. His head was cleaved in half and both halves of his head were cauterized. The remains of the head spilled on the ground and the body of the axe wielder crumpled into the dirt, lifeless. The Jedi performed a backwards somersault as the other human attacker grabbed at his legs. Lorhas landed perfectly and swung his lightsaber in a horizontal arc. The human was cut in two and dead. The Jedi Master had easily dispatched two enemies in six seconds.
The Jedi squared off with the last unarmed human. This person was a teenage boy, rabid and dirty like the others. He was the only one left out of the attackers. Despite watching all of his companions drop, the rabid boy was still out to kill the Jedi Master.
Lorhas: "Cease this needless violence! Or I will be forced to defend myself!"
The boy didn't listen and punched at the Jedi's head, which was promptly side stepped.
*It is now Gor Ak's turn.*

Switching comm signles. "Serria Main need evac to safe location! Everything has gone pear shaped! Have engaged hostiles more incoming, what is your eta over!"

"Roger Serria Main. Red 7 is advised." Switching signals again. "Red 7 to all. Bang out! Bang out to the mountains now! This is an order!" Vor'en watches the Jedi Master dispatch enemy after enemy. Wondering if he never lays awake at night hearing the screams of the fallen. Wondering if he will ever be rid of the strange sence of guilt that he himself carrys around with him every where he goes. Putting away the scanner and drawing his blaster pistol again, Vor'en realizes that they may not get out of this in one piece.

Gor 'Ak hears the frenzied order by Vor'en. He wanted to definitely retreat. Gor shouts to Squirts to follow him as he was attempting to cover him somewhat. Squirts hears the yell from the person who was near the bottom of the hill. Squirts promptly turned around and began running down the hill. The renegade whom they met seemed to like order and he was abiding by Gor Ak's order without question. It made Gor wonder if Squirts had any military training at all.

The Jedi wookiee moves closer to the little girl, trying to not frighten her. Children had one of two reactions to the large furry creature: either they enthralled by him and wanted to stick tightly with him, or they reacted in abject horror. He reaches into his pack and pulls his old vox box, that hadn't seen much usage over the recent months, as most of his team could understand him. He presses a button on the recorder, and a calm voice emitted from it, "Hello, my name is Woroken. How are you?" It wasn't the perfect greeting for a child, but it would have to do under the rushed circumstances. He was hoping
she would react well, and he could get her out of trouble soon.

Vor'en trains his pistol sights on the teenage boy about to attack the Jedi Master. He hadn't gotten close to the Jedi so it would be a relatively easy shot. He squeezed the trigger and watched as the boy toppled over from the bolt. The energy beam struck the boy in the chest and burned a hole in his body. The teenager toppled over ungracefully like a headless tauntaun. From where Vor'en was standing the boy seemed dead.
The Jedi Master shut off his emerald lightsaber.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Quickly Sergeant, account for your men and let's move."
Vor'en noticed his sensor pack revealed the quick-moving life forms were 198 meters away and closing. The green blips were flashing with each proximity-wave of the sensor burst.

I...am continuing...towards the girl." A thousand thoughts were going through the young mans head. Why is this girl here, why was she running from the direction of Vor'en, were he and the Jedi slaughtering innnocents? He had heard about the Sith from old shows, but wasn't sure if he was just jumping to conclusions. Thinking to himself *"Hmm, I'll just have to be vigilant."*

Just as Aymaric, Woroken, and Awne near the girl's position on the hill, the kid springs up and begins running down the slope. She was screaming violently and completely ignoring anybody else. Before long she was at the bottom...running north. She seemed to have nowhere specific to go, just running out into the open. The little girl was even jumping and clambering over any rocks.
The three who wished to help the girl were gathered together watching her move away. They saw master Lorhas run over the crest and temporarily stop at their position.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "What are you guys doing up here? You were given instructions to continue towards Mur Eva!"
Vor'en took a quick look at his chrono. It seemed they were 16 hours and 30 minutes into the mission. He could see the faint signs of light in the sky. Sunrise on Vjun would occur in an hour and a half; if you could call it that. They would be lucky to have the sun penetrate the lingering dark clouds of the barren world. Nevertheless, they would lose the advantage of the concealment from night. SpecForces were taught to use night at all times. Especially in a low-profile mission such as this.

Awne stood where she had paused at the sound of fire then silence. And would be standing there still when the Jedi and the soldier begin to come down the hill. Arms crossed and tail puffed and swishing violently she looked the part of a very pissed woman...though that may have been because she -was- a very pissed female. If it weren't for the hill she'd probably be tapping her foot impatiently. "Finished playing herro arre we?"

The Jedi Master gives an empathetic look towards the Farghul padawan. He certainly understood the concern she felt for them. It was hard to believe the whole fight was over in like five minutes. It felt forever to the group who had been trying to reach their comrades.
Lorhas: "We don't have time for this. According to Vor'en we have a hundred or so creatures rapidly approaching us. That little girl should be fine, I purposely used the Force to get her out of harm's way. Those people we encountered were savages, they were out to kill. Even the children. I sense terrible things all over.....Do we have everyone, is everyone ok?"
The older Jedi had a slight look of sadness combined with purpose written on his face. He waited for an answer.
While Gor 'Ak was looking around, he sees the rogue "Squirts" approach him. Squirts was oddly silent after these events, as if he had seen a million worse events. Gor 'Ak looked amongst the wide hill that led to the plateau, however he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. The immediate area was clear.

The people who were left on the hill gathered together in a sloppy formation. They walked/slid down the sloped incline covered in loose dirt. The group had noticed their pants and boots had become very dirty. Some of them had even got annoying dirt into their footwear.
The unit linked up close to Lues, Feldon, and Qwy. Vor'en had gathered Lance and Sav along the way. They created a patrol formation on the fly with Team 1 on point, command element center, and Team 2 rear security. Sgt. Vor'en felt the pressure of the closing life forms on his men. He could start to hear the hard breathing coming from everyone, even the Jedi. They had definitely began logging in some good footwork on this mission, and there was more sure to come.
Lues continued to act as a navigator as he was guiding the patrol east by southeast. It was likely some people in the group had become annoyed with the search by running into hostile after hostile. It was as if Mur Eva was nowhere to be found.
Vor'en looked off to their front. He and the others observed the mountain ranges approaching them. There were many sloped inclines, hills, fingers, and 45 degree angles that marked the upward climb. These terrain features were sitting at the bottom of the mountain. From what it looked like it would be a gradual walk up steep terrain; that terrain would evolve into climbing. They were likely appreciative of the flat ground now, as it would soon be nothing but a challenging climb.
The Sergeant had set the pace for a fast walk to the patrol. Lues skipped a few steps to catch up to the Sergeant as he was on high alert, checking all of his men to make sure they were doing their jobs. As Lues spoke out to him, Vor'en snapped out of focus for a moment.
Lues: "Sergeant, we're going to have to traverse these mountains. I can detect Jes amongst the cliffs. We shouldn't be too much farther. I'd say about an hour mov..."
Lues is cut off as Vor'en's sensor screen catches his attention. The reading was beeping near the plateau they took contact at back near the west. The life forms had assembled were the battled had happened. A few more radar blips revealed the creatures were heading the east. It seemed they were coming right for the patrol. It was at least 102-105 beings. The former stormtrooper would have to make a call.

"Ya I imagine this isn't the end of it darlin'." Vor'en walks at a fast pace trying to put as much distance between them and the enemy. Switching comm signals. "Sierra Main, How gose the repairs to the ship? Over." He didn't mean to upset Awne, he really didn't. She needed to understand that he has alot of people who depended on him to make the right decition at the right monment then those orders to be followed.

"Red Squad is heading for moutainous area. We have incoming hostiles, about 105 to 120. The civilians we checked on are savage. Heading to the mountains to try to lose them." Looking at his scanner again he could tell that they where still with in a comfront zone that they could still lose them if needed.

Woroken listened to Vor and began walking even faster. He would be glad when this day was over--he could feel his legs starting to wear a bit. He hadn't had a mission this physically active in some time. He stretched his long legs while trying to keep the pace. Hopefully Master Leus was right and Mur Eva would be close; perhaps ever over the next hill.

Staff Sergeant Vor'en ordered everyone into a run. They were no longer effectively patrolling, they were doing their best to regulate breathing and endurance. The flat ground on which they were running had hardened significantly thanks to the rain a couple hours prior. So each footfall reflected impact into everyone's leg bones. Every deep breath the members took gave them a taste of a sort of acidic dew morning smell, it was as if they were breathing a mist of hot sauce. Clearly Vjun was not the most comfortable of places, and it was being proven again and again.
The unit moved over small hills; hopped over rocks, and jumped small crevasses in an effort to close distance with the mountains. It was noticeable as the flat ground gradually increased its degrees in a slope. They were hitting the base of the mountains. Red Team was proceeding on a finger that rose up into a cliff. As they continued to jog they looked back and saw the sea level elevation behind them get lower beneath eye level. This run was getting them elevation and quick.
The individuals began to feel the nauseous sting of fatigue setting in as they felt pain in the knees and stomach. The acidic air was not helping matters at all. After about seven minutes the group stopped at a cliff face. The only way to continue was up the rocky wall.
The formation took a security halt near the cliff face. Team 1 watched above the cliff walls high above. Team 2 took rear security looking back down the downward sloping finger, while the Jedi were looking left and right into the valleys.
Lues went to Sgt. Vor'en.
Lues Van: "Sergeant, this is the only way. We're going to have to climb up. Hope you still have that rope."
Lues eyes were diverted to Lance. Lance was visibly exhausted. He was hacking and coughing hard. The soldier was having a hard time breathing and it would be more difficult to get him to continue on the movement.
Sgt. Vor'en would have to determine how he was going to break this down.
*Lance is -1 on the condition track.*

The events on the hill with the little girl had muddled the mind of the young medic. His musings over the state of the young girl and the unanswered questions about the other 'Savage' he hadn't seen, made Aymaric overlook the fact that he and the others in their little hodge podge group were in a seriously dangerous situation. The hacking cough of the one called Lance, snapped Aymaric back to his senses and helped him focus on the looming emergency.
A soft whisper, heard faintly over the com, "Damn me for not paying attention!" Then a normal volume statement. "Vor'en, we need to stop and rest for a moment. This climb is dangerous, even for rested and fit people. At least let me asses Lance there and administer some stimulants for those who want them." Not waiting for a reply from the Vor'en, Aymaric moves to Lance and begins to asses the young man. He also examines Vor'en quickly and gives appropriate aid.

Aymaric looks over the group cautiously. The soldiers seemed to be holding security even though the medically trained man was assessing them. They all seemed to be just slightly fatigued.
He then turned to Vor'en. He had taken a few cuts here and there. But most of the damage was done to the bandages and synthflesh that were applied earlier. There wasn't much Aymaric could do for him until the synth had properly held against the skin. Vor'en would just not benefit from any treatment right now.
Aymaric noticed the sensor pack was still pulsating. Indicating life forms were still approaching them.

Gor 'Ak opened his mind during the meditation. However, this was against his training to do such things...he was trusting his instincts. His gut was telling him there was some kind of trouble imminent, but he wasn't sure as to what it was. This whole place gave him a bad feeling.
He opened his eyes and scanned the valleys, finger, and cliffs. Everywhere seemed empty and desolate. Gor observed many large rocks and flat land throughout. He couldn't see anything suspicious however. He could see light beginning to pour through the thick clouds. Sunrise was on its way.
The medic Aymaric looked at Lance again. He was coughing and dry-heaving. The soldier would need to rest for at least 10 minutes to be at normal health again.

After removing his Falsoor cloak and setting his medical kit on the ground, Aymaric takes the respirator out and hands it to Lance. "Here you are, this will help clean out your lungs a little." Aymaric turns to Sergeant Vor'en again, thinking of a question he had wanted to ask since the last battle. "Vor'en, those people you were fighting, did any of them have Falsoor uniforms on?" Aymaric wasn't sure why he felt the need to ask the question, he just knew he had to.

*You don't have any material for explosives to rig on your sheet. Do you want to make some kind of trap with frags or your thermal?*

" I'll catch up." The decision had been made. The group would climb, even though they had an asset available that could get them to the top quicker and safer.
Pulling the Thermal Detonator and grenades from the bandoleer he took from Theos' body, Aymaric prepares the explosives for use. Using mesh tape to combine 1 frag grenade and 1 grenade launcher frag, the explosives novice makes 3 improvised demolitions charges. The final product created is 3 grenade packages taped to 1 thermal detonator.
Aymaric verifies his chosen location as the safest and most effective to make the barricade. Placing the explosive, Aymaric sets the timer on the ThermDet for the max 18 second countdown, and runs for cover.
"Stand by for a really big blast!" This comment came as a last minute thought, he was too excited by the idea of creating such a big explosion, that he forgot about safety. This comment made quietly, as if he were talking to himself. "This is gonna be fun!" The glee in his voice is very obvious.

Awne begins climbing almost simultaneously as Aymaric is constructing his improvised explosive. The agile and lean Farghul grasps each hole in the cliff face. She had vast experience from her martial arts training to give her the strong body she needed to climb. The Jedi was advancing with ease, making sure her paws were firmly hitting each foothold/handhold.
She observed the sky while reaching for each crevasse in the rocky wall, sunlight was approaching. The keen climber remembered to look anywhere but down. Her vision was not all hindered as her feline eyes could see in darkness. She saw a rock platform about 30 meters over head; it would serve as the first rest point for the less able climbers. The padawan would tie the rope off there.
Meanwhile, Aymaric traveled a moderate distance down the finger to the boulders and rocks. He set the cluster of explosives under one of the bigger rocks, estimating this would be just the right amount of power to get the task accomplished. Aymaric set the detonator to the 18 second fuse and ran back to the cliff face the party was mustering at.
The thermal detonator emitted a tremendous boom sound. The area around everyone became very well illuminated with a brief flash. The flash was so bright you could even see your shadow upon the ground/cliff wall. The large boulder and the surrounding rocks were atomized. They vanished into thin air after the flash. If anything, Aymaric had made it easier for anyone to get up the finger. Now the path was completely clear of any obstruction. It was likely if the life forms didn't know they were there before, they knew now.
Lues Van responds to the comment directed toward Master Lorhas after the thermal detonator blast.
Lues: "I think shooting at this place would be a waste of time, nothing worth blowing up."
Master Lorhas looked at the Jedi Knight as if he hoped that was a joke.
All of a sudden, you hear the welcoming sound of atmospheric thrusters. The *Starshade* was approaching the unit rapidly. It would be to there position in mere seconds.

The *Starshade* continues overhead by at least 1000 meters. It still had some distance to go to reach the unit.
Awne had a clear view of the freighter as she was tying off her rope to a rock on the stone platform. This platform that was jutting from the cliff wall was very sturdy and durable. The Farghul looked down to her compatriots who were easily a good 76 meters below. The feline Jedi gave the others a hand gesture that signaled it was safe to use the rope. Now though, they might not have to climb with the Lieutenant flying.
The *Starshade* begins to make a high pitch whining sound from its engines. Everyone notices that the front point of the centered cockpit points down. The whole ship was now on a sharp downward angle. It was quickly traveling to the surface at an unsafe landing degree. Within seconds the ship collides with the ground in a shockingly loud boom. The ship slides down the fingered terrain violently and comes to a halt. The freighter had crashed about 150 meters from the group, a little past where Aymaric had set his explosives.
Vor'en heard no comm chatter whatsoever from the Mon Calamarian Lieutenant.

The two young soldiers could probably use his help is getting into the ship and checking on the Lieutenant, and he knew he could help Aymaric treat the Lieutenant as well.

Woroken just barely heard Gor Ak issue a a warning as he headed toward the ship. Pausing for a moment, the wookiee slows his pace and heeds the advice of his team member. The events of the last few days had caused the normally fearless wookiee to attempt to follow the plan, at least this time.

Master Lorhas looks over to Vor'en and it seemed the Jedi was concentrating slightly.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "If you'll believe me, I think the presence of the Dark Side is washing away anything in that ship. My senses can't break through the veil of this eerie shroud. That's about as clear as I can articulate it. There could be immense danger or nothing at all. I feel you can make the better judgment as mine is hindered out here."
However, Woroken and Awne are both sensing through the Force as well. They had a slight communion going on as they could detect their friends reaching out in the Force as well. The Wookiee and the Farghul had a feeling that this presence is the same they felt earlier at the plateau where they had taken contact.
Woroken and Gor cautiously approached the fallen *Starshade*. It seemed to be hanging off the ledge of the finger dangerously. There was no sound emitting from the crashed ship. Almost instantly as they noticed the quiet atmosphere, a mob of humans rushed at them from behind the freighter. They were clambering over and running around the hulking machine. It seemed that the ship had barricaded these humans for a few seconds.
This was a crazed mass of creatures that Woroken and Gor were encountering. They were indeed human, but they appeared as rabid as Wampas. They had a multitude of improvised weapons such as sticks, rocks, and different heavy items. Some of them were even armed with more effective weapons such as axes and knives. There were women, children, and men. Some of them were wearing what seemed similar to the gray two-piece Falsoor uniform. They had a blank look in their eyes as they charged the two who intended to search the craft.
Everyone near the cliff face could only see a mass of silhouettes gathered around and atop the large freighter. They couldn't see Gor or Woroken. *So only those two know they are being rushed. The rest of you can't tell what is going on unless they comlinked you.*

At the same time as he started to move backwards, Gor opened his comlink.
"Sarge, we have a problem. Get your guns out, now! WeÂ´re coming back"
Closing the comm, he cries at the top of his lungs to the other two with him.
"Fall back"
He fires a warning shot into the crowd of crazed people before turning tail.

Woroken pulled his light saber, knowing he did not want to cleave into these humanoids who might not be in their right mind. He listens to Gor and begins to withdraw as quickly and safely as possible, keeping his eyes on the oncoming rush of humanity. Checking on the Lieutenant would have to take a backseat for a few moments. "Trouble!" was the thought the wookiee attempted to send to his Master through the use of the Force.

The warning shot that discharged didn't phase the charging humans one bit. There seemed to be no end to their number as they continued making their way past the ship. They were falling off the ship in a frantic manner. As if they had no regard for their own safety. Woroken and Gor counted about twenty of them and it was painfully obvious that these people were numerically superior. None of them attacked yet, but it did seem they had the intention. It was likely they hadn't attacked because they haven't reached their position. Everyone on the comlink channel heard Gor Ak's message about trouble.
Woroken stretched out through the calming essence of the Force quickly and felt, *Come back.*

The wookiee kept his weapon drawn, but he knew the humans would not be intimidated by it. He turned, realizing that he would either have to attack to kill, or be overrun if he tried to hold his position. "Come on, Gor. Let's get out of here!" he exclaimed to the soldier at his side. He began moving as far as his long legs would allow back toward the remainder of Red Team.

Aymaric paused where Gor'ak had stopped him. Gor'ak was right, better to let the combat capable secure the area before he attemted a medical rescue.
Witing just a few feet from the rest of the group near the cliff side, Aymaric becomes aware of several dark shadows climbing over the downed ship, and before he can yell a warning, Gor'ak issues one of his own. *"Sarge, we have a problem. Get your guns out, now! WeÂ´re coming back" "Fall back"* The single shot from Gor's pistol punctuates the warning in Aymarics head.
"In the name of Fett's fury, what are these things!" Having not seen the creatures in the last engagement, and now seeing several shadows swarming the ship made the frustrated young man irritated over the lack of information. He felt he had been left in a very large and very dark room, with no indication of the exit. That would soon be resolved though.
An image of the Electro Binos Sav had picked up off the body of Dor, quickly passed through his mind. Just as quickly, the irritated bundle of frustration and anxiety, ran over to Sav and snatched the EleBins off Sav's utility belt. "If you aren't going to use these, then I will!"
Raising the binos to his helmeted face, Aymaric makes the necessary adjustments so he can see what they are dealing with.

Aymaric zooms in on the wrecked freighter down the finger. The mass of humans around them were identifiable as Falsoor employee's he saw at colony P-57. It was scientists, workers, and families from that area. He had seen these people before. Only now, they appeared to be a shadow of their former selves. They seemed rabid and fearless, with heavy intention to kill anything in their path. It was indeed a fearful sight to someone with low willpower. He noticed that a lot them were wielding a variety of weapons. However, almost none of them were toting ranged weapons. They were all charging straight to Gor and Woroken.

Woro and Gor 'Ak run the relatively short distance back to the cliff face. Awne had just gotten down the rope as the rest of the group was assembled at the base of the cliff. To everyone's horror, the large group of humans was following Gor and Woro! Within a few seconds the mass of human beings would be on their position. At least one hundred humans were coming up the narrow finger. Everyone could see the crowd as they were 50 meters away now. Red Team had their backs to the cliff face and the only ways to go was toward the enemy, off the steep side, or up the cliff.

Getting back to the cliff face, Woro sees the remainder of Red Team, and hears the mob on his heels. Putting his back to the cliff, so at least part of him would be defended, he ignites his saber. "Looks like we have no choice but to fight," he grunts preparing for the oncoming rush, "Unless someone has a better idea."
Just before the humans reach his lightsaber range, he steels himself for the battle.

Not really seeing that he has a choice, Gor prepares for a fight...and possibly a last stand. Thankful for his pistols autofire switch, he engages it and draws forth a grenade from his belt. If heÂ´s going down, heÂ´ll take as many of these creatures with him as possible. Studying his new opponents, he tries to find some sort of weakness that he and his friends can possibly exploit.
((Hopefully a Move and Swift action can be done before the combat starts. Then IÂ´ll use a Full Attack action to make an autofire attack with the pistol (-7, 3d6+3 Energy damage, 39/50 ammo, spend a Force Point) and throw the grenade a few ranks back to avoid hitting allies (-2, 4d6+3 Slashing damage).

"Screw this! Nice knowing you all, I'm outta here!" Turning towards the cliff, Aymaric quickly puts away the Binos and slings his rifle. Grabbing the rope, he begins to pull himself up.
Only inches off the ground, the Falsoor employed security guard comes to his senses. He realizes he wouldn't make it to the cliff overhang before the group would be over run by the beings and killed himself. Dropping off the rope and unslinging his rifle, Aymaric silently checks his energy cell and verifies his last grenade in the grenade launcher.

The Farghul, Jedi Master, and Wookiee take a position just a bit off the cliff wall to stave the potential attackers off. Lues quickly orders the troops to hold the rope and begin climbing. Squirts, in mercenary fashion is first to jump on the rope and begin climbing. Lues didn't seem to mind as if he is glad someone was taking the means to expedite the escape.
The savage individuals were being bottle necked up the slim uphill finger. Some were as uncaring as to just slip and fall off the side of the finger to their doom. A group of ten humans seem to make it up the slimming terrain to the unit. They were sprinting, with weapons branded and fists in the air. They were growling and frothing nonsense as the unit prepared for a fight.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Back away! Throw down your weapons and turn around! We will defend ourselves."
It seemed the Jedi Master shouted this warning out of pure necessity as it was obvious that these people were not going to yield an inch, and they were definitely numerically superior by at least 90 something people.

The small group of ten makes it to the area where the Jedi and Sergeant were holding their ground. Rocks began to fly out of the mass of people behind the initial line of savage attackers. The rocks were flying at Squirts climbing the rope and at the one's holding the wall down. In addition to the ten humans beginning to swarm the defensive line, there was a larger group of humans mobbing behind them. They were pressing the group back into the wall with their superior numbers. The fierce looking humans lashed out at the defense with murderous intentions.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Hold the line! We mustn't let them threaten our escape route!"

Vor'en unleashes a hail of blaster fire with his light repeater. He takes just enough time to bring the weapon into the shoulder and the barrel at eye-level. The energy rips through two human males directly in front of him and two males behind them. The bolts tore through their torsos like they were nothing. The four humans fell to the ground and the other parts of the mob clambered over the fallen. Regardless, the humans still swarmed in front of his allies to bludgeon them.

The wookiee focuses his mind for the inevitable. He had no choice but to attack the mob to hold them off so the group could get out of there. He pauses momentarily to focus his mind. He knew he would be be practically overrun, and steeled himself to that realization. "It's time," he though, taking a slice through the air with his blue lightsaber toward the closest human.

Woroken presses his shoulders against Awne and Lorhas. The four individuals were forming a solid wall of bodies to block the uphill climb to the cliff wall. The ferocious human beings would have to get past the the veteran warriors to get to the rest of the unit. The Wookiee noticed a teenage boy attempt to slash at him with a small knife. The boy didn't look as if he wanted to get through the Wookiee, rather that he wanted to kill him. The Wookiee side stepped the blade while twirling his lightsaber, when the lightsaber hit a full rotation he dropped it on the boy's shoulder. The shoulder was cleaved off and the boy collapsed over. The shuffling humans just walked over the young boy's body and swarmed the Wookiee as if nothing happened.
The Jedi Master rallies behind the Wookiee's attack and uses the Force to send five of his attackers in front of him surging through the growing mob. The five human beings crash into four individuals behind them with a violent thud. All 8 humans lay prone as they are knocked over and confused by the situation. Only 6 individuals get up as they jump back up at the Jedi Master.
The crowd in front of the defensive line was growing. Each member of the line saw growling and roaring faces. It was like a hornet's nest was buzzing, except these hornet's were much larger. Knives, fists, and axes were lunging at the the four people holding their ground. Awne's quick reflexes spotted a man thrusting an axe straight at Vor'en. Awne nudged Vor's shoulder a bit so he would step away. The axe narrowly missed the soldier as the Farghul let out a feline growl to the axe wielder. Even this man seemed a bit scared as he stepped back into the mobbing crowd.
As this happened, Woroken shoulder blocked a young girl who was going to grab Awne by the ankle's. Awne quickly looked to her side and back to her front as the four people were dodging the attacks in tandem. The requirement to hold this massive crowd off would be precise teamwork. They were watching each others backs well.
Woroken felt a few clubs and fists hitting him in the back as he was momentarily helping Awne. They were poorly aimed attacks that did nothing to the durable Wookiee. He shrugged off the attacks and continued to vigilantly hold his area.

Aymaric looks up the cliff face where Squirts was awkwardly getting up the rope that Awne provided. It would take him a few seconds to get up the wall so the others could proceed. He also observed that Awne, Woro, Lorhas, and Vor'en were courageously holding off the mob by themselves. Thankfully the marauders couldn't surround them as the uphill finger bottle necked the entire crowd to the defensive line. There was no way to flank unless they wanted to fall down a cliff. Aymaric stood ready should anyone get past the line.

Not being the most useful asset of the group in melee combat, Gor slips back towards the rope, getting ready to ascend once Squirts is done. Flicking the switch of his blaster back to single fire mode, he sent a bolt flying against one of the opponents in the evergrowing mass.

Awne reaches out with the Force to push some of the attackers back that were amassing violently in front of the defensive line. She feels the Force respond to her just as naturally as if she was ringing a bell. Four rough individuals are launched back into the mass of humans directly to the rear of them. One of them seemed to fall wrong after a backwards tumble and landed on his neck. This individual was no longer moving.
Gor notices the powerful Force attack by the Farghul. He takes this moment of brief confusion by the attacking crowd to back away from his allies holding the line. However, Gor quickly notices that if he fired into the crowd he would have to aim carefully over his friends who were shoulder to shoulder holding the assailants back.

Squirts struggles to climb up the rope, but he makes no progress. Indeed, he was not particularly strong enough to be pulling himself up a rope with all his gear on. No one else would make any progress until this mercenary was able to do so. Gor 'Ak noticed that he was having trouble and realized that this situation could get bad quickly if people couldn't climb. He elected to fire at anything if the enemy got past the defensive line.
*Your action is readied. I let you move Squirts as a free action this time, but next time it will cost you an action from Gor as by the followers' rule. I did so because you didn't get to attack when you wanted to. It is now Qwy's turn, followed by Vor'en's.*

Qwy observes the crowd of rabid humans gathering in front of the defensive line. Vor'en, Woroken, Lorhas, and Awne were holding back at least 90 humans who were stacked against each other. He had no place to fight with them in front of him. He saw that Squirts was not making any progress up the rope on the cliff wall. All of those who were behind the defensive line realized that if Squirts ended up taking too long it would be best to get him out of the way and let a more adept climber go. As of now the mercenary was slowing the escape.

Lance Starfell charges toward the defensive line and stands next to Sergeant Vor'en. Vor'en nods to Lance as he replaced in the defense. Sav runs closely behind Lance and gets behind Awne in the line. The veteran soldier turns around and sees Lues standing next to Squirts getting up the rope. The Jedi Knight responds to Vor's statement.
Lues Van: "Squirts is having trouble climbing the rope! We got to get out of here or the enemy will crush us by sheer numbers!"

The Wookiee stands his ground without any hesitation. He swung his lightsaber in a wide arc to swat the crowd away from him. The energy blade seared through two human beings as easy as an arm passing through air. A young male and an older woman dropped in half as a result of the efficient lightsaber attack. The Wookiee found that this required no skill, as attacking these mindless individuals was as simplistic as chopping trees. His lightsaber training from Master Lorhas had certainly prepared him for much more difficult tasks. The battle would go well if it persisted like this.
The Jedi Master observed that a man was lunging at Woroken to throw a rock at him. The rock was quite large and could hurt the Wookiee if it struck him in the head. The Jedi instinctively reared his arms back and outstretched them quickly. All of the surrounding Force-sensitives felt a surge in the Force as Lorhas spiked the area with a powerful slam. Those who were standing in front of Woroken were knocked over instantly. Sixteen savages were on the ground sprawling in confusion after the attack in front of Woro and Kel-Yun.
However, the sixteen humans recovered themselves with tireless persistence. They got back in the faces of the Jedi and his apprentice. Woroken and Kel-Yun braced themselves for the rush of attackers. The two heroes locked arms and thrust their shoulders to push the enemy line back. The men heard the growling and frothing of the meleers as their rush was averted.
Woroken growled at Awne as a stray club went her way and she promptly dodged the attack.
The Farghul feels a stray blade strike her in the shoulder as she was evading, giving her a minor scratch. *Ten damage.* She also sees her companion Lance and Woro get struck a few times by two kids flailing with their arms. *3 damage to Lance and Woro. Woro cancels for his talent.* Almost immediately after Lance backs away from the kids, a large man jabs a knife at Lance's face. The cut was decently deep as he scoffed in pain. *13 damage.* Awne dodges a little slow as an axe grazes her forearm. *13 damage.* Despite all the weapons, hands, feet, rocks, and growls whizzing past the heroes...they remained steadfast in their defensive position.

Four people directly in front of Awne topple over, as does a dozen or so behind the four. The rabid humans were tossed around to their confusion.

Gor 'Ak gets near the daunting cliff wall where the rope and Squirts were dangling. He holds the rope steady and gives the mercenary a slight nudge. He slowly climbs up about one meter. Gor looks back to the defensive line as he grabs a hold of the rope. They were holding back the mass of attackers valiantly.

Vor'en hears the report from Lues. "Tell him to get his tail up there. If he can't then tell him to let someone else though." Vor'en activates the grenade and throws it into the enemy trying to make it land in the middle of the group. "Fire in the hole!!" He shouts. Hopeing everyone hears him and takes step to not get killed by it. "Lance, Sav after this pops get ready to open up!!"

Sgt. Vor'en prepares the grenade and promptly tosses it over his allies who were holding the massive crowd back. The grenade arcs smoothly through the morning darkness. The impact of the grenade landing is never heard. However, the mortal screams following an immense blasting sound is very distinct. It was too far away to see the results of the grenade through the crowd. He had thrown the grenade far enough to avoid hitting his comrades. There was no doubt though he had injured or killed several individuals.

Things were a blur around the wookiee Jedi at the moment. He knew the defensive position of his team all right, but everything else blended in as he tried to maintain focus on the deranged humanoids continuing their attacks against Red Team. He momentarily wondered what was wrong with them as they were clearly not in their right minds, before pushing the thought away, as he continued to attempt to dodge their attacks.
He continued his two handed lightsaber attacks, hoping to whittle down the number of attackers while the others were escaping.

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-03-26 20:32:52)

The Wookiee maintains his concentration despite the humans frothing like madmen in front of him. The grenade attack by Vor'en seemed to stir them up frantically. One young boy lunged at Woroken's head with a knife. The Wookiee, forced to defend himself, drops the boy with a lightsaber thrust through the stomach.
The whole composure of the crowd changed dramatically after the explosion, and now they were trying to push through the lines as opposed to just fighting the four defenders. Woroken manages to cut down a woman and a large man with wounding strikes as they try to push through him and Awne.
Woroken looks over to Master Lorhas to notice that he is concentrating with his green lightsaber in a defensive stance. The Wookiee quickly spotted a dozen medium sized rocks floating in front of him. Almost instantly, the rocks shot forward at blinding speed. The fist sized rocks ripped through three people in front of Woro and Kel-Yun. They were obviously dead. The remaining rocks struck a young girl and a man armed with an axe, killing them instantly as well. Despite the bodies accumulating in front of the defenders, the humans clambered over them to rush the lines. Large amounts of dust had been kicked up as each individual began to taste it in their mouth. This fight was beyond bloody and was all about survival.
Woroken feels an axe strike him from an individual with ragged Falsoor clothes. The blow did not hurt at all, thanks to the power of the Force. After that, a knife slashed him from a teenage boy. This attack didn't hurt either, as the Wookiee was strong with the Force. Once he looked back to his front he saw four humans colliding into his mid section. The Wookiee fought with all his strength but they pushed him back one meter. The four man, shoulder to shoulder defensive line had been knocked out of equilibrium. The enemy was trying hard to muscle their way through the lines now.
Kel-Yun quickly responds to his padawan in trouble and gracefully executes a lighting-quick four stroke attack. All four humans who had pushed back Woroken dropped to the ground in a dismembered pile. However, five more humans rush right back in front of the Wookiee. Awne spots the humans and attempts to fight back the savages who were trying to push through their lines. Unfortunately, her grip slips on her lightsaber and it goes flying into the crowd. She saw it land between the feet of some humans in front of Lorhas. The lightsaber is promptly picked up by an intrigued savage woman.
The five individuals who were gathering in front of the Wookiee used this time to attack. An older man in a Falsoor uniform delivered a square blow into Awne's gut. *5 damage.* A lady who had a disfigured face kicked Lance in the kneecap. *4 damage.*
*Shew, lot of moving parts to this phase of combat. If you guys have any questions let me know. It is now Aymaric's turn.*

This mob scene was quickly getting out of hand. Very glad he didn't recognize any of the crazed people, Aymaric mutters curses under his breath, "C#*&IO, K#$#AT, J%$$GG! Hurry UP you weak limbed Chuba, climb that rope!" Having his back against a wall and not having anywhere to go to escape the current situation, the red headed former Republic Medic, finally makes a decision.
These things were no longer rationally thinking beings. There minds seemed to have been destroyed, and they were going to kill everyone if the group didn't escape soon. These thoughts were going through Aymaric's mind when he raised his rifle and fired at one of the creatures not wearing a Falsoor uniform.

*The terrain you guys are involved with is a slim uphill finger, which is wider down towards the bottom. There is about 10 squares space between the defensive line and the cliff wall. Because the finger gets wider with less elevation, it would be difficult, but possible to blow some enemies off the steep terrain. The position the friendly line is at right now is about four characters wide. So any bad step to the left or right could be a stumbling fall to their doom. Furthermore, if you get right next to Lorhas it provokes an Attack of Opportunity from those who just got in front of Woro as he was pushed back.*

While the Jedi Master was fending off the mindless attackers in the defensive line, he looks to his allies among the lines. He brought his lightsaber up in a defensive stance to speak.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "These people are strong in the Dark Side! Do not hesitate to do what must be done to protect yourself and friends."
Awne heard the Jedi Master speak, but she was becoming lost in the fighting. There was a growing sensation of darkened emotion growing in her. It felt as if she was losing control. All the slaughter here felt like it was triggering something in her. The Farghul's breathing was beginning to pick up.

Awne calms her mind despite the chaos and let's the Force communicate with her about the disturbance. It was as if she opened a metaphoric floodgate. Her mind was being filled with uncontrollable thoughts of rage and destruction, which seemed to be mirroring the feelings of the mob. She tried to focus but to no avail, the Farghul was quickly losing control in the cesspool of emotion. Her connection to the Force was undergoing a great storm that was brewing relentlessly. While she was fighting, her breathing was rapidly increasing. The apprentice's concentration seemed to be getting clearer as rage was building.
The Wookiee could sense the Dark Side emanating tremendously from the attackers, but Awne was radiating more than them. What was worse, is that it seemed like her presence was phasing in and out of the web of the Force. She was shining brilliantly, then disappearing. He kept his lightsaber up and kept his eyes focused on the enemies in front of him, regardless of what the Force was communicating to him.

Aymaric moves swiftly from the group that was on the cliff face. Squirts was making little progress. But no matter, Aymaric was insistent on helping the defense. He stood next to the Wookiee and fired into a group of five people, not really disseminating too much as long as they weren't wearing a Falsoor uniform. He squeezed the trigger quickly as he looked down the sights of his rifle briefly. A blaster bolt struck a brunette woman square in the chest. The female promptly fell over with a short growl.
Awne saw a man squaring off with her armed with an axe. The man bore hatred in his eyes as the Farghul stood at the defensive. Suddenly, the Jedi apprentice roared and brought her arms into her chest. She looked as if she was holding something invisible between her hands.

The newcomer Squirts continues his slow climb up the cliff. He sees that Gor is going to get right behind him and picks up his rate of climb. Squirts advances about 4 meters along the wall.
Gor looks up and sees that he was beginning to climb decently as he grabs a hold of the rope. The Bothan quickly puts one hand over the other as his feet were bracing him against the cliff. He could see Squirts just above him and felt small pebbles landing on his head from the person climbing overhead.
Compared to Awne who was climbing earlier, these two seem less skilled at using a rope. However, they were doing well enough to make decent time. Once Gor advanced up just a bit more, someone else could get on the rope.
While the Farghul continued to stand with her comrades on the defensive line, her rage was growing within. The other Jedi around her felt this as well. She was angered, yet she was focused and controlled. The Jedi apprentice stared her opponents down with determination.

Qwy looks over to the cliff face seeing that Squirts and Gor 'Ak were moving up decently. However, there was not enough room underneath Gor to climb. The Selkath brings his rifle up and aims into the horde of savage creatures. He fires a shot but his grip slips and the bolt grazes Sgt. Vor'en's arm. The Sarge feels a burning sensation rip through his left shoulder. His flesh was burnt by blaster gas. Qwy had accidentally hit his ally while attempting to aim past the defensive line to hit a marauder.

Vor'en brings the efficient light repeating blaster up into his shoulder. He barely looks through the sights as he unleashes a hail of blaster fire into the crowd. The humans were effectively ripe for automatic fire. The Sergeant tore down a hole in the mob by shooting down at least ten people. He watched calmly as each individual fell quickly to the chaos of blaster bolts. Killing of this kind was not new to the Sarge. He was going to keep fighting despite the pain he felt in his body.
Those who saw the Farghul noted that she was visibly shaken, and it seemed she was preparing herself for some kind of Force technique.

Woroken was alarmed, not only by the endless mob before him, but the Dark power he felt coming from Awne. "Stay calm, Awne," he growled loudly, hoping to be heard over the rush of people. He knew if his friend lost control, she would be much more trouble than the mob. "Master, check her," Woroken says as he continues to attack whomever he can reach with his gleaming lightsaber, "I am okay right now."

Woroken skillfully slices through three individuals in the crowd. His lightsaber thumped each time he jabbed, slashed, or struck someone with his sword. The Jedi Master shouted in agreement to the apprentice to check on the Farghul. He cut down a few marauders in an effort to make it to Awne's position; however, the Jedi realized he couldn't make it to her without compromising the defensive line.
The Farghul Jedi noticed that the crowd had thinned out a bit. Following this realization, the nimble fighter juked and sprinted through the humans with a fervent charge. Everyone lost sight of Awne. The crowd turned almost in unison to grab the person who had infiltrated their ranks. The Jedi Master turned to his allies in confusion as the line was no longer being attacked. He wiped the sweat off his brow and shouted.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Awne, what are you doing?!!"
That's when it happened, everyone could feel a growing emanation in the Force. The energy of the Force was rising tremendously in the Farghul. Once the energy levels hit its zenith... a blast of power shot the gathering crowd into the air and sent their bodies far from the mountain finger. Not one individual out of the crowd escaped Awne's uncanny Force attack. The creatures screamed in futility as all of their lives would be lost due to the stunning velocity they were flying at.
Everyone's eyes shifted from the launched creatures to the Farghul. She was levitating in the center where the crowd had been. After a brief moment, the Jedi apprentice dropped to the ground and went unconscious.
There was no longer a threat, for now.

"Wow, next time you plan on doing that, give me a heads up will you?"

"On my way Gor." Vor's unanswered COM chat and Gor's request for assistance reminded Aymaric that there was still an unaccounted for member of the Republic team. None of the others were bad enough to need immediate care, so he quickly gathers up his Medical Kit and moves out with his weapon at the ready, taking heed from Gor'ak's defensive posture.
Jogging up to Gor'ak's side. When he notices Squirts on the other side of Gor he offers his hand in a gesture of greeting. "Squirts right? Names Aymaric, nice to meet you, again" Directing his attention back to Gor, Aymaric verifies his COM is off then asks a question. "Hey Gor, what's going on with your Jedi? They seem a bit...wrong." His face shows a look of hard thinking. "Almost like they are not in control of themselves, especially the little fuzzy female with a tail."

Woroken notices Awne's lightsaber on the ground and picks it up as he approaches her. He examined her closely and discovered that she had no visible wounds. The Wookiee did a quick search of the Force to reveal that she was only resting, and very peacefully at that. Medically, she would be fine. The apprentice notices Feldon walk past him as he checked Awne quickly. He was frantically checking each member of the unit. He shouted over to Aymaric.
Feldon: "When you get done could you check on Vor'en? He seems to have a rough burn on his shoulder!"
The Jedi Knight instructs Lance to sit down on a rock and Feldon removes his helmet. He opens up his shirt a bit and presses his hand against his knife wound. *Lance restores his full 18 hp.*
Gor 'Ak and Aymaric proceed down the finger to the crashed *Starshade.* He could see nothing around the ship that would arouse any alertness. His instincts weren't very clear, and he wasn't sure if he could trust his senses completely on the matter. Nevertheless, Aymaric and Gor stopped next to the ship. The landing ramp was shut firmly...it could prove tricky to get inside of the ship.
Vor'en checked his wrist chrono and realized they were almost seventeen hours into the mission. Sunrise would be occuring within the hour, though they wouldn't see much through the brown cloud cover of Vjun. His scanner continued to beep and if they were to do a thorough check of the ship, the vehicles would likely arrive at their position. He would have to make a judgment call here, *Knowledge Tactics.* Pull out and avoid another hostile encounter...or risk it and stay to search for a friend whose condition was unknown? What's more, he had wounds to be treated and so did others in the unit. At least the acidic rain from earlier had not returned.

He felt hungry and generally odd. He had never been in combat and wasn't sure if this was just an effect of the retreating adrenaline. The few seconds it takes Vor'en to respond allows Aymaric to do a self assessment of his condition.

Woroken looked blankly at the scene surrounding him. Awne seemed to be in okay condition for the time being. He figured it would be best to leave her as was until they decided if they were moving or taking a break. He kept her lightsaber, making a mental note to hand it back once she awoke.
He moved to Lorhas's side, away from earshot of the others, and in a low growl (for a wookiee) asked, "Master have you ever seen anything like that before? I have seen the two of you knock down opponents with the Force before, but never that many at that range. And the flying...?" His voice trailed off.

Kel-Yun Lorhas adjusted his robes because they were in disarray after the fighting. He responded to the Wookiee.
Lorhas: "I've never seen anything like that. She was using the Force in a capacity that seemed very unusual. She had utilized such power that is beyond what we can do with our attunement. That was something that I doubt even Master Skywalker could do, though it seemed odd in nature. But they say the only limit to the Force is your mind.."
Vor'en gives the orders out to the unit and Lorhas nods to the apprentice.
Lorhas: "Anyways, we'll look into this later."
Aymaric walked briskly up the hill back to Vor'en. He arranged the sergeant's gear to get a good look at the blaster burn. Medically speaking, he was a mess. He had already gained benefit enough from bandages and synthflesh that no more first aid would help. He would have to go deeper into treatment if he felt it necessary.
A little ways down the finger, Gor 'Ak observed the large freighter. Both sides were kind of teetering on the narrow upward path. The centered cockpit was facing away from him, so he couldn't see into it in this darkness. The ship was also on its belly, which meant he couldn't open the ramp if he wanted to. The landing gear had not been deployed. There were no threats to him that he could see.

Removing his Med Kit, Aymaric pulls out his surgical kit and starts to give more in-depth aid to the severly wounded Squad leader. Pointing to a raised portion of sand, "Sit here, this won't hurt a bit."
He had kept himself busy until now, trying not to look at the bodies lying on the ground. He didn't want to see another face or keepsake of someone he knew. Because of this, Aymaric hadn't thought to look through the bodies that littered the finger, to see if any of them were still alive. Preparing his surgery kit for use was something that was drilled into his head from school. He didn't need to think about what he was doing, so he listened. He listened for any signs of a living being in the mutilated bodies still on the finger.

Anyone good with making a make shift harness for woro to carry Awne up the rope I think I have enough peices with my utility belt to get one going but am going to need a hand with the process?
((DW I figure that he could use the temp cloak as kind of a swaddle in a sense to place awne in and use his Utlity belt and bandolier to help rasen her to woro all the while making it so it wont hinder Woros climb.))

Still working on Vor'en, "I have a repulsor stretcher you could use. If a couple people climb to the top then pull the stretcher up with the strapped in kitty up the cliff, it might work." Nodding his head towards his medical kit. "It's in my kit there." Then adding. "If you tie a rope to one end so she goes up head first, the repulsors should be able to keep her from bouncing off the cliff."

Qwy looks at his make shift swaddle and then looks back at the lift kit Arym seems to have on him.
Qwy: "Ya know on the battle field ive never had someone actually carry a stretcher with them let alone one that they don't have to carry. So much for my ingenunito in getting her up lets strap her on the stretcher and get moving."
Dishearted that his one time to shine was taken away my modern technology Qwy quietly helps place Awne on the stretcher and places his temp cloak over her to keep her dry exposing him to the enviroment. After gathering up his equipment and shouldering his weapon Qwy volunteers to assist Woro in getting the stretcher up the cliff face.

*Let Vor'en decide if he's willing to stay there for 10 minutes while you perform surgery Aymaric.*
Qwy has an idea to use three utility belts together to carry the Farghul up the cliff. He asks for two more belts and Feldon/Lues give their equipment up promptly. He crosses two belts across the Farghul's chest to make shoulder straps on the Wookiee. Then the last belt connects with the others to hold the lower portion of Awne stable. He was almost certain this would work. He believed the stretcher would not be needed.

As they move down towards the ship, Gor tries to find some way he could at least get around the ship to get a view of the cockpit. He pulled out his comlink and commed VorÂ´en.
"Sarge, the ship looks intact from what I can see, but she has made rough landing. IÂ´m not sure how to get in though. The ramp is blocked, and I canÂ´t get visual on the cockpit. I could blast an opening in the hull, but IÂ´d rather avoid that, given we might need the ship again. WeÂ´ll try to work our way around the ship to see if we can find some way in"

Woro nods at Qwy as he slides the harness holding Awne over his broad shoulders. Qwy had done a fine job of rigging this together as her weight felt very balanced on the wookiee. He grabbed ahold of the rope and wrapped it around his waist hoping to give a little more support in case anything were to go wrong. He then started climbing.
*DW, if I can take 10 per the wookiee species trait, I will do so, but I am not sure if I can do that balancing Awne on my back. Anyway, climb modifier is +9 (5 Str, and 4 level). I'll also burn force points to aid in my climb, if I can't take 10. I still have 10 for this level, so total bonus would be +9 +1d6.*

Aymaric injects a sedative to ease the pain around the wound site on Vor'en's arm. The medic then gets more detailed by opening the wound up. He purifies the blood around the hole with a chemical. Then, he utilizes a type of ointment to soothe the burns. Once this is completed, he applies synthflesh to make the injury like brand new skin. The Sergeant felt wonderful after ten minutes of work.
*Restored to 42 hp. Aymaric can't heal the persistent condition, though he thinks sleep and eating would help the Sergeant.*
As the Sergeant feels better, he repeatedly tries to contact the Lieutenant. He got nothing. However, he noticed that his datapad was beeping. The two vehicles and life forms were 200 meters away and closing. Vor'en couldn't see them in this darkness.
Woroken and Feldon proceeded up the rope on the cliff wall. Despite the low-light, the two individuals climbed easily up the mountain. They advanced about 60 meters until they got to the natural rock platform where the rope ended. If they wanted to advance anymore they would have to free climb. Feldon checked on the Farghul and seemed she was still ok. The rig on Woroken's back was holding perfectly. This platform was very sturdy and wide enough for a few people to stand on. It would serve as a good place to rest and watch the others if they so chose. *Qwy gains 500 XP.*
Team's 1 and 2 remained around Vor'en's area. So did Master Lorhas and Lues Van.

"Master Feldon, we should probably break here. We might be able to assist the others making their climbs from here. And my shoulders could use a break as well..." the wookiee says, glancing at his right shoulder, where the rig had began to aggravate him, even though his layer of hair. "I'm a good climber and think I could make the top, but to be truthful, I would rather wait to see if Awne recovers first. If I were to slip, while carrying her..." he stops his thought there, looking down to the ground below.
Woro carefully slips the rig off, and makes sure his friend is in as comfortable and safe a spot on the ledge as possible. He uses his all temperature cloak for a pillow and positions her as far from the ledge as possible.

Feldon listens to the Wookiee's growling intently and chuckles.

The Jedi Knight walks over to the edge of the natural platform and looks down toward his friends.
Feldon: "I can't seem them too well in this darkness. I really hope the Lieutenant is ok. If she needs medical attention, I'm sure Aymaric can handle it."
The blonde Jedi seems a little desperate for a minute, as he most assuredly wanted to be near the Lieutenant if she needed medical attention. He shakes it off and looks toward his apprentice.
Feldon: "Anyways, you've done well on this assignment so far. Hopefully your good work will bear merit. You want to take a minute to eat some of your rations? I could use some."

Seeing the Master peering intently below, Woroken says, "I am sure Aymaric can handle things down there. We probably need to keep our attention on Awne. This is her second um...epidose in a week. Have you ever seen anything like this before?" he asks, grabbing some rations from his belt, and tossing some to the Jedi Master.

Feldon Azrik: "I know, it seems like she had no control. The first episode being when we were on the ship over here."
The Jedi munches on some of the dried meat in the ration.
Feldon: "I've been watching over her for years, and she does seem to act strangely here and there. I just can't describe it. This sort of thing started occurring years ago when were on Tatooine...remember those days? There is no explanation after my studies on her. Obviously, this will be more information I can use."
He puts his food down for a second and places his hand on the Farghul's forehead.
Feldon: "Hmm, she's resting perfectly...and her presence in the Force seems extremely calm. I think she's in a trance right now."
Feldon sits down next to Awne, resting his feet for a minute....he then looks to the sky.
Feldon: "I can see daylight faintly through the cloud cover. Sunrise should be in an hour, not that will see the sun in this desolate place."

"I'd be happy to help Awne if she weren't up there." Pointing up into the darkness Aymaric continues, "Besides, she's in good hands with the Wookie. He seems to know a great deal of medicine. Now as for the chow, if anyone has anything other than rations, it would considerably more helpful. Eating real food seems to do more for the body." Finishing his question, Aymaric digs into his Utility Belt and pulls out a ration bar and starts to unwrap it. Taking a bite and producing a sound that can only be described as inward vomiting, his face quickly shows a look of sour disgust, then just a quickly a look of fasination. "Bantha fur and Corellian tarts? Odd combination. Musky and dry, yet excessivley sweet. Hmm"
Aymaric looks toward Vor'en as he asks the old Sergeant another question. "About your lieutenant, would you be able to use your scanner to locate a life sign in the ship. That could be a good indication of wether she is alive or not. I'm not really sure how it works though." Absentmindedly starting to take another, he catches the smell of the bar and puts it down. He's not really sure if dying would be preferable over eating the ration.
(( A note for DW. The HEAL DAMAGE paragraph in the TREAT INJURY section of the PHB says that using the HEAL DAMAGE while performing surgery removes any persistent conditions.

"A friend of ours has gone missing somewhere on this planet. Through the Force, we have found out she is close by and we are hoping to locate and extract her. You've not seen any human females ruing around this planet have you?"
Saying that, Woro only just realized again that the ship and the Lieutenant had crashed before the mob attacked them. He was immediately concerned about the Lieutenant, and turned to Feldon.

The Jedi pushes him the rest of the way and Gor grabs the hull's platform and pulls himself in. He looks around to notice that he was in the cargo bay. It was empty, minus the normal storage crates lying around. They seemed to have been knocked about from the crash. Gor notices Squirts climbing in after him.
The Jedi Master leaps through the hole after Squirts, his lightsaber still at the ready but deactivated.
Lorhas: "Find anything?"

Awne blinks a few more times, her head clearing now quicker and night vision kicking in let her see that the giant shadow that wasn't a rock as it had moved was Woro, and the other was Feldon. Though his voice was slightly distant to her ears in the start, as he spoke she was able to pull his voice into focus as well as shapes "I won? Forrce? Masterr Skywalkerr?" she blinks at the two, confusion clear on her features though in the low light she wasn't sure they could see it. "Meditation? what?...what'rre you talking about?" She shakes her head and starts to sit up slowly "last thing I rrememberr was...getting angrry at those humans that werre attacking us...and then..." she frowns "then I woke up herre with my head hurrting."
The fargul frowns, and shakes her head a little to test if the dizziness was gone yet "what happened exactly? And wherre arre the otherrs?" She looks around as Woro's comlink chirps then up to the ledge and the rope she had put there "and what arre we doing still sitting herre? We need to get up to that ledge and move on."
Looking down to the makeshift harness that seemed to have been started to tie on her she shifts, slowly starting to move to her feet.

Gor takes a quick check of the storage area, noticing it seemingly empty.
"Nothing that I can see...but I just know thereÂ´s something here...and I donÂ´t think its friendly"
He held his gun out in front of him in a demonstrative gesture.
"Stay behind me, but keep close. I might need backup"
Pistol at the ready, Gor started to creep froward, moving cautiously and with great care not to be seen or heard. As he headed forward, he entered an almost trance-like state. He felt invisible, like a shadow or a breeze, casually drifting by.

When you feel up to it, you and Qwy can go ahead and start climbing to the next ledge, if you would like. If you could tie a rope off from there that might help the others, as we need to get out of this place ASAP. I am going to stay here a little and make sure Lorhas and Gor are okay with the ship. I have a bad feeling about that ship, and I want to be close in case they need help."

Kel-Yun Lorhas nods to Gor 'Ak as he decides to lead the way with the roguish Squirts. Gor opens the door of the cargo hold with ease. The lights were on inside the ship, which obviously meant that power remained. Gor and Squirts instinctively cleared the Engineering bay room with the posture of trained soldiers. They lowered their blasters and looked to the Jedi Master who shrugged.
It was dull and quiet inside the freighter, but everyone remained on edge anyways. Gor 'Ak cut right as each footfall presented a metallic clank. He quickly started stepping more lightly. Squirts pressed against the Engineering bay door and nodded to Gor 'Ak. The door whooshed open; Gor and Lorhas promptly stepped into the main corridor in a defensive stance.
To the right of Lorhas was four men, some armed with knives and one with a vibroblade. Lorhas motioned for Gor to hold his fire as the Jedi Master skillfully charged their group. He sidestepped a knife jab and brought his lightsaber around in a blur, cutting one man in half. After that man fell, he quickly dispatched of the others with a blurring flash of emerald lightsaber.
The clothing seemed similar to that the attackers had worn on the finger moments ago. They were worn and ragged. The Jedi's attackers also shared similar behavior to the marauders, savage and careless.
The Jedi didn't take time to search the fallen attackers as he jumped over them. He went into the cockpit area.
Squirts and Gor rushed to keep up, making sure to check any compartments for more attackers. Once inside the cramped cockpit with the stacked seating arrangements, they noticed Callie Baruush was dead.
The Lieutenant Mon Calamarian seemed to have massive head trauma, as the side of her head was exposed. It appeared she was killed as she was flying, likely by the people on the ship who the Jedi defeated.
The Jedi Master looked to Gor and Squirts, his hand covering his mouth in horror.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "The dead have been piled high on this mission."

The farghul takes a moment to the reflect on the recent happenings of battle. She also reached to the Force for answers and it immediately started calming her nerves. The apprentice concentrated in a relaxed manner, seeking any type of answer from the powerful energy of the Force. She felt so close to what was going on, but it was as if she was looking into nothingness.
For once, the Force couldn't guide her to a concrete feeling. She was feeling the Force but it was as if something was missing. A big part of her presence in the Force seemed to be fine, but in obscurity. This almost seemed like she had the answer, but at the same time too much to take in at a time. Nevertheless, the Force was continuing to speak to her as strongly as ever.

Gor gets in the co-pilot seat behind the Lieutenant and accesses a control panel in front of him. He runs a diagnostic check on the ship, the screen comes back to reveal that the sensors and the hypertransceiver were down. Also, the ship's overall performance was reduced. *-2 on the condition track with 80 hp remaining.* The ship was perfectly functional though.
After a few minutes, Squirts returns to the cramped cockpit, reporting that nothing was out of the ordinary.

Leaving the cockpit, Gor decided not to leave anything up to chance, and so went to take a personal inspection of any system necessary for the ship to get them out of the system. As he passes the room where the Jedi Master so efficiently dispatched the strange men, he stopped inside for a moment, producing a small holoprojector and catching the visage of the fallen men on holo. Making sure to get close-up images detailing markings and symbols on their dressing, as well as detailed images of their apperances, he stuffed the recorder away, continuing with his inspection of the ship.

Gor does a quick inspection of the ship. He even goes as far to power the ship up. Everything checked out and it seemed in perfect working order. The bothan listened to the engines and they weren't missing a beat. Without almost any effort the bothan is completely confident in the ship's hyperspace capability. It seemed the wreck just damaged the connections of the sensors/communications and that was it. The freighter was still intact.

Gor 'Ak acknowledges the Sergeant's orders, as he was now in complete control of the mission. Gor gently moves the Lieutenant's body aside and begins the pre-flight warm-up of the ship. The *Starshade* hummed to life with vigor. It would take a few moments before the freighter was ready to fly.
He noticed Lance and Sav behind him, who solemnly carried the fallen Mon Calamarian. They took the body to the cargo hold and blanketed her body out of respect. The Jedi Master made it a point to meditate near the deceased soldier. After this, Lance and Sav took command of the ship from Gor.
The Jedi Master spoke to Gor in the main corridor.
Lorhas: "Well they should have everything under order. We should continue on to Mur Eva's position, we won't be able to land the freighter near the cliffs where Lues suspects she is. Although, we'll have the ship on emergency standby if needed."
The Jedi Master and Gor promptly exit the ship. Once this is done, the group gathers their equipment and checks the area for anything suspicious. Following the quick check, the rest of the squad proceeds up the rope that Awne had set. The whole group rallies on the rock platform and awaits what to do next.

The farghul ascends the cliff into the semi-dark morning of Vjun. Within moments, she has the rope set up and the group following behind her. Once they get to this platform, it was another free climb for Awne to reach the top of the wall face. She sets up the second rope and the unit takes their time to get up the dangerous cliff as they had gotten decent elevation.
Once the climb was finished, they were high atop the mountains and now they had to walk steep earth and crest over rising terrain. The ground was uneven and the rocks were numerous. One wrong step could roll an ankle. They were walking now, so they could assume a formation of some combat effectiveness. Sgt Vor'en checked his sensor pack to see that a life form was really close, past a hill to their right. The creature was about to be in sight.
A humanoid figure with two droids walk over the high terrain, he was forty-two meters away and looking right at the squad.

As the Chiss closes in on the party, a heavily armed soldier and what appeared to be an unarmed man step forward, no not unarmed he thinks noticing the long cylindrical object swinging his belt, a jedi perhaps? The Chiss speaks, " Looks like you all have seen a bit of action, " noticing the soldiers tattered blast vest, " I'm Kardoon, its good to see someone alive out here." With that he glances over at the rest of the group, they look weary they must have seen a bit of action indeed...

" I was just dropping off a shipment of supplies and waiting for them to reload the ship when some droids came in and started shooting the place up, unfortunatley I had to leave my ship and most of my equipment back at the colony in order to make my escape.' Kardoon shakes his head, rememberting that he had forgotten the holodisc with his family photos back there. He gives the soldier and what he believes more and more to be a jedi a questioning look " If you dont mind I'd pose the same question to you, what are a group of heavily armed soldiers and Jedi doing here?" He asks the latter part of the question to see if his presumption is correct. As he poses this question, the soldiers comlink chirps to life, requesting samples if he should be hostile. The Chiss bristles at that, but keeps an even tone his eyes becoming just noticibly more red "You may want to tell your friend" he lowers his tone and speaks through his teeth " I find the idea of that fairly offensive, but he's welcome to try."

My chances of survival probably would not be good alone, either that or trying to talk to my droids would drive me insane."

When he did wrong, Lorhas would be quick with the correction, but would always follow it with praise. It was always appreciated by Woro. If he ever had a padawan of his own some day in the future, he hoped to be half as good a teacher of the traditions as his Master.
"I think we could all deal with some rest. Let's go find Mur Eva, and get out of here. I think I could sleep for a month." He claps his Master on the shoulder in a friendly gesture before moving a bit closer to the conversation happening between the newcomer Chiss and the rest of Red Team.

Uplifted by the wookiee's hearty growl and spirit, the Jedi Master turns to the chiss.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "We welcome you to our group my newest friend. We have some work left to do before we leave. So, let's set out as we have time pressing against us."
Sergeant Vor'en then orders everyone back into patrol formation. The chiss haphazardly walks anywhere in the patrol as the unit is setting up. Vor'en, with the decorum of a veteran of many wars, grabs the chiss and keeps him close to the soldier. It was likely he wanted to keep a close eye on Kardoon. He checks his sensors to notice that any vehicles or lifeforms were out of scanning range.
Once everyone is situated, the group steps off with Awne and Lues leading the group's way through the steep and cumbersome terrain. Lues had informed everyone they would get to Mur Eva's position any moment now.
The group climbs a few feet over rocks, walks steep earth, and drops down elevated terrain. Early morning light was spread across Vjun now.They eventually come to a narrow ravine. The unit takes precaution as they slide down the slick rocks into the cool ravine. A chilly wind blows on their skin inside the darkened area.
Lues breaks ranks of the patrol and walks through the sand/mud about forty feet. He holds his arms up in confusion.
Lues Van: "I feel her....right here!!! What gives?"
The group observes the Jedi Knight as the cool breeze continues to nip at them. Where's Mur Eva? What now?

The wookiee was confused by Lues Van's proclamation. She clearly was not here, at least in front of them. As he had done so many times before, Woroken reached out with the Force, looking for Mur Eva's distinctive pattern. He concentrated hard, thinking of the first time he had seen her showing her lightsaber skills on Tatooine all those months ago, using that as the baseline for his search.

Looking over at Vor'en, who had kept him by his side ever since they started walking, probably didnt trust the chiss yet, couldnt blame him though. The chiss asks inquisitivley "Who is this friend you are looking for?"

As the others climb up the robe, the bounty hunter turned Jedi helps the team up onto the last cliff, looking the Chiss over curiously. "We trrust him then?" She shrugs it off, if Vor'en had let him into the group then he must be alright.
With her balance, and tail curved high to help with that, she leads the group with Lues down the steep terrain, making sure to find the more sturdy places to step and walk and indicating and portions that may be difficult to the others with her tail.
Once below, Lues's exclamation made her frown, where could she be then?
Awne glances around the area, tail flicking slowly behind her, still raised slightly from the climb down for balance. Idly the blue eyed farghul sniffs the air and stares intently to the ground and the surroundings. She pushes her senses out trying to see if maybe she could help him pinpoint the location "If she's herre...she must be perrhaps below? orr above?" she looks up to indicate.

It was as if she had just passed through this area. But their was a veil of obscurity that felt like it was throwing their senses off.

Aymaric had spent most of the time since his last comment contemplating his belly button, basically keeping his head down and trying not to draw attention to himself. Years of getting punched in the face by people who didn't understand his sense of humor, taught the young red-headed man that he got off easy this time. The Chiss' eyes presneted a glowing look that made Aymaric shiver a little. Also, having the older Jedi reprimand him made him feel a bit ashamed.
When the group scaled the cliff and stopped at the site where there lost friend was, the humbled man decided to grow up a little, only just a little. Moving over to the Chiss and lifting the visor of his helmet. "Hey, sorry about the sample comment. I really wouldn't have done that, even if you had turned out hostile." Although his belly button didn't seem to interest him anymre, Aymaric still couldn't look directly at the Chiss. His eyes repeatedly looked back and forth at the blue man, not making direct contact with the glowing red eyes, a few of those glances making there way to Lues Van's direction. Making very quick eye contact, "Nice droids." Then he moves back to his place in the patrol.

Gor walks along quietly with the rest of the group, keeping his attention fixed on the surroundings rather than the newcomer. However, he does also indeed finds the Chiss to be an intriguing species. Even his own people know very little of them. Discreetly, he carries his holorecorder palmed in his hand, trying to catch the ChissÂ´s behavior and social manners as they walks.

He walks to the closest side of the ravine and begins investigating it, hoping to find a trigger or a latch, wondering if there might be some secret door or passageway that Mur Eva might have passed through recently. That could explain the feeling he had of her being close to here, but not here. "Maybe there is something hidden here, Awne. Maybe a door..."

GR1 replies first "Master, locomotion system 99%, minimal buildup of detrius in lower joints power supply 99.5 % and steady."

The slippery yet sandy ravine ground bore no sign of any type of hole or entry way. When Awne inspected the ground for hollowness; the surface seemed very stiff and rigid.
Feldon looked over to Awne and shrugged. He had walked a few feet away from the group to look elsewhere.
Within moments, five figures came into sight at the rear of the group. They were armed with your average sporting blaster rifles. Three were Quarren and two were humans. A human who seemed to be middle age with a pot belly spoke out to the group in a kind tone. He had a cigar in his mouth and a black beard.

The patrol noticed it was light out, although still dreary by most planet's standards. The thick clouds of Vjun made it difficult for any sunlight to penetrate. It was also particularly dark inside the ravine.

"Ok we will check there next, at there refuge maybe she is there." Looking around at his rag tag group. "Besides we could use a secure pllace to rest and tend to wounds and the like. If that is ok with your friends Aymaric?" Vor'en checks his scanner to make sure there is nothing else in the are beside his unit and the people they had just met. "Ok, Lues, Me and Awne on point, Gor left, Aymaric right. Woro with Gor, Feldon go with Aymaric. Keep a watch on our six and comms open. Master Lorhas will help in the middle. Call out your targets and clear you lines of fire we don't need to be shooting friendlys. Gor check on the status of the Starshade. Move it people I want to be in secure camp before night fall." Vor'en issues his orders and checks over his light repeater. Maybe thing where starting to look up for a change.

***A few moments a go:**  Drayden: "I remember you now, whatever happened to that girl you hung out with at the Test Tube?" Aymaric just shrugged with a half-hearted smile. The images of the charred corpse that had once been his love coming back with harsh emotions. Emotions he thought he had under control. Moving to take his place near Gor in the ravine, Aymaric puts his hand in his pocket where the silver braclet of his loved one is. He could feel the lettering as he lightly rubbed the warm metal. Memory of the day she gave it to him came back quickly &quot;Love never dies.&quot; Rathoth had talked with Aymaric about that many times in the past; that love may be hard to find, but once its found true love never dies. Keeping pace but not keeping attention with the group around him, he switches his rifle to his left hand, then puts the bracelet on.*
**PRESENT:** Thoughts of what were and what could have been continue to occupy Aymaric's thoughts as he follows the formation to it's next destination.

Drayden looks over to the Sergeant with a look of compassion.
Drayden Desu: "Well, I hope the person you're looking for is there. I'm warning you...our current home is a sarlacc hole. No....not literally. It smells as about as bad as one after all the livestock we got in there."
The security chief notices the strict orders given out by the soldier as the unit gets back into formation.
Drayden: "Wow, you guys are knit together like an army...just what are you guys up to? Oh well, let's get out of here."
Feldon and Lues seem visibly distraught as they had to stop searching the ravine. It was as they were in disbelief at not finding Mur Eva.
The patrol, led by Drayden's group takes about twenty five minutes of travel. You head east along the ravine and eventually climb out of it. The team crosses more rough terrain and eventually comes to an alignment of boulders. Drayden weaves past them and drops down into a hole. The group awkwardly drops down into the cool hole and immediately notices the expansive area in front of them.
A rodian guard in a worn Falsoor uniform nods to the group coming in. You take a minute to survey the place where Drayden's men have resided.
It was definitely a cave, and everyone seemed to have sectioned areas to themselves with no privacy. Mats were laid out and families seem to be making due with their survival efforts in this cave.
Plasteel bins were set up with industrial lamps to mark supply areas. A person was generally posted at these supply areas; most likely to ensure even distribution of supplies. In the back corners of the cavern were livestock sections with makeshift fences. *Knowledge: Life Sciences to identify the creatures.*
The survivors of the colony had all established decent living conditions in this cavern. The people looked at you as you entered their home as if they hadn't seen outsiders in years.
Drayden looks over to the group as you get past the rodian guard with a smile.
Drayden Desu: "This isn't much, but it's our home. We've all poured our souls into this so take our hospitality with gratefulness. Please use anything we have at your content. Do you all have any questions?"

Thankful to finally get a moments respite, Gor sits down inside the hideout, pulling out some rations from his utility belt, and starting to devour said rations quickly.
Looking around the groups hideout, he notices the livestock in the back of it. He couldnÂ´t recognize them on sight, but he felt as if he had seen similar creatures somewhere before. He also couldnÂ´t help noticing how the people in the cave looked at them. They must have been living under these circumstances for a long time indeed.
As Drayden left the field open for questions, Gor rubbed his furry cheek a little as he finished of the last of his ration pack.

The wookiee slumps down against the cool cave wall, thankful to be able to break for a moment. He felt uncomfortable about leaving the prior spot where Mur Eva 's Force signal was so strong. If there got no new information from this place, that would be the logical place to start the search again.

Awne moves next to the wookiee, flopping down as graceful as a tired, cranky, probably sun-burned farghul could. Coolness of the cave was a welcome change, she could feel her fur cooling down by the minute. first it's too hot, then it's too cold, at least here it was the perfect temperature. Leaning her head against the wookiee's shoulder she sighs and closes her eyes to give them a rest, her ears perked to continue to listen.

Woro smiles at Awne as she flopped down on the ground beside him. "Been a long day, Awne," he croaks. He was pleased to have a chance to rest, as he had been going virtually non stop for a couple days now. Even as he body took a short respite, his mind kept humming. He was still trying to work over the Mur Eva situation--how did she vanish, and did she really attack the members of the squad on the rooftop? And what was behind Awne's continued blackouts and amazing displays of power?
He waited against the wall, hoping to hear how long they were gonna rest before resuming the search.

Gor 'Ak notices that the creatures were kybucks. They were typically used by mounts for most people. They had brown fur, horns atop their head, and they bore a similar body shape to a tauntaun. The creatures possessed powerful hind legs for running and small forearms. Kybuck were known to carry lots of weight and were good at climbing difficult terrain. The refugees were probably using the animals to get around.
Another fenced off area parallel to the kybuck was a stable of nerfs. Nerfs were about 1.3 meters tall and had shaggy fur. They were four legged animals and looked like the type of creature to graze for hours. There was a human female who was tending to the nerfs. *They look similar to shaggy bulls.* Gor 'Ak guessed they were probably using the nerfs for food.
Drayden speaks to Gor as he is checking the refuge out.
Drayden: "You know this planet has almost nothing going on at all times. The only thing I know about Vjun's current events is that a lot of droids chased us off our colony."
The chief-of-security dismisses the quarren and humans.
Drayden: "Oh yea, there is a local band of smugglers who have a hideout here somewhere. They keep to themselves, unless you have something they want. If you have something they want they change from smuggler to bandits. They don't mess with us too often, but we have had our share of exchanging blaster fire with them."
Drayden strokes his beard and observes the refuge while continuing his conversation with Gor.
Drayden: "Other than that, I can tell you there is nothing on this rock."

Kardoon walks over to a corner at the far end of the cave and sits down, alot has happened over the past few days and he needed some time to collect himself. He had alot of questions but knew he'd figure out what was going on eventually, didnt want to be nosy especially when this group was helping him. He pulls out a ration bar and begins to take small bites, chewing carefully but not tasting anything as he was lost in his thoughts. Daydreaming of his life over the past few years, he begins to wonder what kind of life would have been better a long dull one or a short exciting one," We all have to live with our own choices, I've made mine, I can rethink my options when I'm out of here." he mutters to himself, looking at his dark blue hands, normally immaculatley well kept, now calloused and dirty from all the climbing. Shaking his head slowly he leans his head back against a cool rock and rests his eyes not knowing when he'd get the chance again.

Drayden bends over and takes a container of water. He uses it to wash his face up a bit. The man dries himself off and looks at Gor.
Drayden: "No, I'd say our colony is one of the few places that actually had activity going on this planet. But I've been wondering, are you all with Falsoor? It certainly doesn't seem like it. You have camoflague uniforms that don't look like the company issue."
The older man takes a moment to reflect.
Drayden: "Come to think of it, one my search groups did find a sensor relay dish around here. They also discovered a passageway that went across a steep gorge. That seemed kind out of place. That might be unusual enough for you, but what are you looking for? Don't you want off of this place?"

Aymaric was stood in a corner looking at the people in the crowded cave. He was looking for anyone he knew, hopefully none of the people he owed money to were here. Feeling the effects of fatigue, Aymaric slides down the wall until he is sitting. He crosses his arms over his knees and rests his unhelmeted head on them. Sleep will be great, maybe the deep emotional pain will be gone when he wakes up.

Hearing the talk about the sensor relay and nearby passageway perks up the large wookiee. "The passageway talk sounds promising.

*Gor, Aymaric, and Woro have been removed of their -2 modifier. The rest of you are still -2.*
Some of you who are resting against the cave wall notice that Feldon was visibly distant. He had a stare to him as if he was losing his Jedi decorum. He seemed to disappear into the small population of colony survivors. Master Lorhas seems to be watching Feldon and Lues intently. He notices that Gor and Vor'en are picking information out of Drayden. The Jedi Master walks to the apprentices who were resting and speaks up. He was checking his lightsaber for damage.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Yes, take a moment to rest up. I don't know our next course of action or when we are going to proceed. You might want to check this place to see if anyone is trading supplies after you've caught your breath. You two might also get some valuable information by asking around. Resting gets you prepared, but don't overdo it...more often than not idle time can be spent better otherwise. You'll find that the Force will augment your body more and more to achieve things when you are in need."

Looking up to the wookiee as she stands straight she nods and looks about for her master. Nose to the air and tail flicking she moves further into the cavern to find her masters scent while asking a few people if they had seen the Jedi Healer.

He needed to buy rations to replace those consumed in the last couple of days. Upon discovering such an seller, he would use the machine to ask "Do you understand Shrywook?"

Woroken quickly finds that most people weren't selling their supplies and that most of them couldn't understand him too well. As Woro is on his way to check another supply station, he's stopped by a female human who looks crafty and well-dressed in her Falsoor uniform.
Human woman: "You seem like a curious wookiee. Say, just what are you looking for? Sorry I don't understand two-legged carpet speak too well so go slow."

Standing up he stretches, all the activity and then a sudden respite had made his muscles stiff he decided to take a walk around the cave and get his blood pumping again. The inhabitants of the cave seemed to be spread out in groups, mostly huddled by themselves. As he neared the rear of the cave he noticed the wookie, Woro he thinks it was, didnt know if it was a male or female, all wookies looked alike to him, talking to a beautiful woman. Kardoon had always found human women attractive, hell he found alot of other species attractive, something more exotic than the other chiss back home, and this one was exceptional, short auburn hair, pale skin and big dark eyes greeted him as he wandered in their direction. As he gets closer he hears the wookie speaking very slowly, a voxbox clutched in its hand. The womens voice was soft, but had a hardness that seemed only too recent.

With her answer, he was not sure whether or not she understood his language or not, but he decided to press the point. "If you can understand me, I have some questions.

At the entrance of the cavern, Gor and Drayden continued talking about the point of interest that involved the relay dish.

"Look, I try to be a man of my word, and that means among other things to know when to and when not to give it. WeÂ´re not getting offplanet anytime soon, and IÂ´m not sure my friends would want to leave before we are done with things here. So I wonÂ´t promise to get you out of here, but I can say IÂ´ll do my best. Sounds fine to you?"
He wasnÂ´t really lying, the ship still needed some patching up before it was hyperspaceworthy, and there was probably an equal division among his friends who would want to stay and who would want to go.

You are almost finished with school! Tell him Freslo, he can't leave!" Aged man's voice, calm and concerned. "The boy has to do what he feels is the right thing for him. He will never be happy unless he follows his wonder-lust and gets it out of his system. He will be okay as long as we support him and trust the force to guide him." Aged man walks over to younger man." Your mother will be fine son. Go out and see the universe, we will always be here for you." Adrenaline rush of excitement, fear, the unknown. A deep and gravelly male voice, also very loud. "MOVE IT YA PUKE! The sith won't wait for you to spit out the mud!" Smoother voice, female."No Private, you don't need to put an IV in a corpse. A hydrated corpse is no less unhappy." Male voice, shrill, bored. "This is Vijun. Welcome to the paradise that will be." Theatrical flourish and a half-hearted grin. Female voice, loving, sweet. "Love never dies. Only when you stop loving will it cease to exist." Male voice, deep and gravelly, unnatural. "SPIT OUT THE SITH BOY! THE MUD NEVER DIES!" Female voice, rougher. "THE DEAD LOVE A GOOD DRINK!" Dead man rising off the table with a smile. Takes a drink from a bottle of alcohol. Man in horrendous parody of a comic entertainer. "WELCOME, toooo PARADISE!" Theatrical arm sweeps over a desolate landscape with demonic droids and charred bodies. Female voice. Loving, deep. Sweet, gravelly. "Love ceased to exist when you stopped loving me." Half charred face of Rathoth. Full head of beautiful blond hair. Left eye missing. Disappointment in her smile. "You stopped loving me."*

With barely a thought Aymaric agrees. "Sure, it sounds like fun! Give me a minute to grab my gear." Running over to the corner where he left his gear, Aymaric puts on his bandoleer and throws his Med Kit on his back. "Alright, ready to go."

Aymaric had seen his enthusiasum reflected back at him through Gor'ak's smile and expression, and he tried to contain his eagerness. "Your right, this has been a pretty horrible few days, and I'm sure they aren't going to get better." He puts his gear down in fornt of him. Continuing to stand, Aymaric verifies that the visor on his helmet is still down then begins looking around at the crowds gathered in the underground cavern. Friend or foe, Aymaric didn't feel like being surprised right now, he was starting to regret telling everyone they met who he was. At a volume slightly less than normal, Aymaric mutters to himself. "I'll be real glad to get outta this hole."

Drayden notices Aymaric joins in the conversation and looks back over to Gor 'Ak.
Drayden: "I like you kid, it seems you've given me a very honest answer. I'll go get the coordinates from one of my men and bring it to you shortly. Sound good?"
The chief of security leaves Aymaric and Gor 'Ak standing there. It appeared he was urgently going after those promised coordinates.
Back near the supply stations, Feldon speaks with his apprentice.
Feldon: "Well, we have lost a lot of individuals while searching for Mur Eva. I feel for those who've lost comrades on this mission. I also, just find myself missing her unbearably. I've never felt this way before... all my life I've really felt empty towards everyone. There has only been the Force for me."
Near the wookiee and the chiss, Uan excuses herself from Kardoon. She leads Woroken to an area near the back of the cavern. There was a small tunnel with wall lamps guiding them down a short path. At the end of the path was a small opening with a energy cage. A trandoshan was imprisoned in the cell. Uan told the rodian to shut up as he was speaking and she gestured to a wall display.
Woroken saw an assortment of weapons such as blasters, swords, and spears. But something immediately caught his eye out of the weapons. There was a pair of Ryyk blades...and they had been made out of extremely good materials. The metal was shiny and the hilt bore a material that was tough yet soft, perfect for gripping well. Despite the quality materials, it still seemed lightweight as he picked them up to try them out.
Uan: "Like those? Supposedly these were passed down ages in Kashyyyk. A legendary wookiee from thousands of years ago constructed these...and he was rumored to hunt numerous monsters in the Shadowlands with the blades. It possesses the extreme power of any Ryyk blade but three times as easier to weld due to the streamlined weight. It's history and ceremonial design is said to fire up the spirit of any wookiee who uses it."

Woro picked up the Ryyk blades, twirled them around in a test of their effectiveness and was amazed. "These are amazing," he stated no longer attempting to feign disinterest. He had used Ryyk blades in the past on occasion, but had never felt any with the balance of these. They also made him feel proud, whether it was from his wookiee heritage or something else, he was not sure. He kept staring at the blades in his hand, even after ceasing the battle display. "I wonder if such a fine blade would be for sale," he says to the female, smiling, knowing her purpose for bringing him to the desolate cave was exactly for that reason.
Waiting for a response to his query, he motions towards the Trasndoshan in the cage. "What did he do," he asks. Even though he had been brought up to hate Transdoshans for their crimes against wookiees, Woro had attempted to eliminate that innate hatred, in line with the teachings of the Jedi.

We're going to keep him here for a while until he can get us a ship from his friends or some useful information. We think he's with the local smuggling ring but he denies it.

I will happily give you 1025 of my credits for the weapon, if that might do the trick." He pulls out his credits to show the merchant he was indeed telling the truth.

Awne steps up to her masters side more, wrapping a comforting arm around him in the semblance of a hug. She wouldn't force the action, but she did hope he would know he could lean on her. "I've neverr seen you like this beforre Masterr...you carre about herr a lot morre than the rrest of us don't you? Morre than just a comrrade orr a fellow Jedi, but rratherr a close frriend...family even?" She rests her head on his shoulder and sighs as she thinks on this new revelation by him.

Feldon seems to be struggling, but it was obvious he was quickly getting in his emotions back in control. It was as if his padawan was helping him immensely.
Feldon Azrik: "Just like family, she's all I've ever known. You know ever since Lorhas trained us she's been by my side. She always watched over me, like a big sister. Other Jedi were always amazed by her skills and so was I...it's not like her for me to have to come to her aid. All these new situations...it's something I'm not used to."
The Jedi Knight didn't seem at all ashamed that he could be possibly setting a bad example for his padawan. He chuckles to himself a bit and accepts the padawan's comfort.
Feldon: "I've been giving you a hard time about this sort of thing. But, better to know your weakness and confront it than pretend it isn't there. As Jedi we mustn't block our emotion, rather we should embrace it and control it. The Force is reality, as is emotion...we must control both."
Although it seemed normal for Feldon to try to throw a lesson at Awne, it didn't seem like the usual lecture. He was visibly distraught. Feldon had always acted calm and polite, but now that Mur Eva was missing he had become different.

She trails off in thought, it was strange, but oddly comforting to hear him talk like this. It *was* good to hear him express emotions that she hadn't seen him express, it just showed that he did care, that he did truly care and love his 'sister' or 'fellow jedi' however he saw her and the rest of them.
Softly she purrs against his shoulder, that thing she controlled so much she decided to just let loose for a change, it seemed the most comforting that she could do for now. "We'll find herr.."

After Vor'en makes sure that everyone else is takin care of, only then does he find a place to rest. He makes himself comfrotable as he could then falls fast asleep. His dreams are the same as always. He sees the faces of all those he could not save, The village that he had killed the Officer to save only to watch it burn and all in it killed, Young Ben and his other friends that had been killed they all haunt him when he sleeps this is partly way he sleeps very little. He awake a few hours later and looks around he was still on the hellish planet and there was no hope of him getting off it anytime soon. *"Might as well check the defences and on the others."* He thinks to himself. He grabs his flack vest gunbelt and E-11 and heads out to do his checks. Switching on his comms. "Awne care to join me on checking defence and the others. I could use the company." She was his closest friend and he couldn't imagine his life without her in it. Sure she was allways yelling at him for his ability to allmost get himself killed on a regualer bassus but that was part of his job after all.

The smile of a person who thought they just told a really great joke appears on Aymaric's face. Get it? It's a desert! I kill me!" The young man laughs and continues to laugh a few seconds longer than he really should. "Well Gor, what do you think about this smuggler business? mAybe we can get some equipment from them, and another ship! They usually have good ships, right?"

"When we get out of here, IÂ´d suggest you stick to your medical career. I donÂ´t think showbuissness is ready for you yet"
The Bothan looks equally amused, probably more at the lame nature of the joke than at its actual content. He draws his fingers through a test of his fur and laughs a little again.
"Oh, this sand will always be with me. IÂ´ll probably never get all of it our of the fur. But IÂ´d rather steer clear of the smugglers. From what our friend told me they seem to be little more than thugs, and the only thing we would likely get anything from them is at gunpoint. And IÂ´d rather avoid that"

Uan sure seemed to be gone for a long time with the wookie, whatever she was showing him had piqued his curiosity, well he'd have to wait to see what it was, as he waited for them to return he looked around the cave, he was pretty sure he smelled like rancor breath, but seeing as she had been living in a cave with no running water for several weeks she probably didnt smell any better, oh well, beggars cant be choosers. Looking across the way he notices one of the Jedi, Feldon he thinks his name was, looked like he was on the verge of a mental breakdown, great all he needed to be hanging out with was an emotionally distraught Jedi.

Uan: "We are all fine, medically speaking. I'm afraid credits is the only way we can trade."
After a few minutes in the cavern hideout, more and more people started getting up for the morning. A quarren dressed in a Falsoor uniform approached Gor 'Ak.
Quarren: "Greetings, I have the coordinates to the sensor relay. If you'll so kindly as to lend me your datapad I'll punch it in. However, I doubt there is anything of worth out there for you. It's probably just an old Imperial transmitter or some of the smugglers ring equipment."
Back near the supply stations, Feldon embraces his padawan for a few minutes and lets go.
Feldon: "Awne, let me see your weapon. It took a nasty toss during the battle did it not? You've got to learn to hold that thing better. By the way, did you keep that weapon off that fallen lightsaber wielder we fought in the colony?"

He retraces his steps up and out of the chamber down which he was led. He quickly locates the group of his longest-known friends, Awne, Vor'en and Feldon. He walks up and sees them in conversation, deciding to wait for a lull in the conversation before butting in.
Hearing Vor'en ask Awne to leave, Woro steps into the conversation. "Before you all go, would either of you have 500 credits I can borrow? I need to make a purchase from a local weapons merchant I met, and I am short on funds. I'll pay you back as soon as I come into more credits?" Honestly, after all this time Woro wasn't sure if Vor could understand his tongue or not. He thought sometimes the old guy understodd shriwook, but sometimes that didn't seem to be the case.

When the Quarren approached and requested a data pad, Aymaric tried to pull his out of his bag, but the Bothan was quicker. Putting it back in his bag, the short time resident was glad to hear that they would be riding the Kybucks. "Yeah! I get to ride a smelly fur ball through desert wastes of Vijun. Again I say YEAH!"

The Jedi Knight quickly observes his apprentice's lightsaber and notices it is in good working order. His attention quickly shifts to the fallen person's lightsaber crystal.
Feldon: "Oh my, I've never seen that type of crystal before."
He holds it in his palm, noting the strange dark purple color. It wasn't as shiny as a typical lightsaber crystal. It was as if a dark fog was in it.
Feldon: "It has, a dark aura to it. I don't like the feeling this is giving me."
The Jedi nods to the wookiee to accompany him to purchase his new weapon.
Feldon: "I'll look at this more later."
The two Jedi move past the crowd of people in the cavern and their stations. They get to the narrow passageway that led to the imprisoned trandoshan and confiscated weapons.

As Vor'en observes the people living here going about there lives as best they can, it always surprises him how positive people can be in these situations, It was like life kept going reguardless of what was happening around them. It kind of lifted his spirits alittle. As Awne walks up to him. "Ya, I'm fine. Just this planet has gotten to me. And then everyone I have let get killed."

Vor'en remembered Bennosuke well. The group was all a bunch of mercenaries and drifting soldiers who came together in hope of money and adventure. The Falsoor contract to hunt Tatooine wildlife had stirred up more trouble than they had bargained for. Instead of fighting non-sentient creatures, they had angered the local Hutt gang. Red Team decided to free some slaves on an employment contract with Bordo the Hutt.
As a result of freeing the slaves and breaching the agreement with the Hutt ruffians, Bennosuke had been captured and tortured to death. Vor'en reflected that it was quite a fight to get away from them. It seemed that a lot of people who had joined their aid to help the Republic or the Jedi met untimely demises. Bennosuke was just one of many of the dead etched in Vor'en's conscience.

She couldn't though, being in that room, strapped to the chair and unable to stop them from killing him, having little less to do then simply watch them; he had died right in front of her and she hadn't been able to do anything.

Aymaric looks past the man as he talks. Then before the man could respond to his last statement, Aymaric continues. "I think I'll take the big one over there. The one with orangish fur." Again continuing before the man could respond and with a dimissive gesture of his hand. "I'll need about 9 of them total with all the necassary equipment."

Just then the wookie emerges from the cave mouth and heads to the others seeming noticeably excited, then returns to the cave, then emerges again several minutes later carrying some vicious looking blades. He was returning to the group at a quick pace almost a gallop. Looked like a kid who had just gotten their first landspeeder and needed to show it off.

Inside the isolated cavern area, Uan places a crate down and looks toward the chiss.

A little embarrassed about his obvious nervousness around animals, the wookiee responds to Gor with a forced grin. "I'm not worried. I'm just, ah, a little... unsure riding large animals. I have fallen off a couple in my day." Although Woro was a fine example of a Jedi, he never quite developed the rapport that most Jedi had with animals during his Jedi training.

Awne had stayed quiet throughout the talks, choosing rather to stand beside Vor'en for a time, then move to the wookiee by first passing Lues and giving him a reassuring squeeze to his arm. Coming up to the wookiee's side she grins "Aw come on Worro, I think they'rre rratherr cute."
She pats his arm reassuringly "You can rride with me if you like." she smiles at him, hoping that even with the undertone teasing, he would find some comfort and laugh a little. Her tail was flicking quickly from side to side, really she was quite excited about the prospect of riding the creatures, while subsequently wondering if she could keep one for a pet...

If a wookiee could be seen blushing through his fur, Woroken would definitely have been. At least, unlike the typical wookiee, he was able to laugh at himself. "Thanks Awne, I appreciate the offer, but I should be fine. Though, if you look around and see me lying in the dirt, please come back and pick me up," he said again trying to force a nervous smile. "I am sure your mount will just love you, though," knowing Awne's relationship with animals was much stronger than his own. "One last question, does anyone know if those things bite?"

"We can go meet them, if you would like," he tells his Farghul friend. He considered the idea most unappealing, but it was time to put his problems with animals aside for the team. "You first," he said, maintaining his jovial facade. They had to travel to attempt to find Mur Eva, and the kybucks were the best way to achieve that goal. "Suck it up," he told himself.

Even though he was not a fan of the large animals, Woro was pleased to see Awne enjoying herself preparing to interact with the kybucks. He continued walking at a measured pace toward the pen, slightly holding Awne back from breaking into a full gallop.
He looked around at the group of people gathered in the cave wondering if any of them had any idea what was happening right now. He doubted most of them would have ever seen a wookiee or a farghul, let alone one pulling the other toward a kybuck pen. With a relief, he didn't notice any obvious bite marks on any of kybuck wranglers either.

However, when Lorhas placed his hand on Aymaric's shoulder, he quickly ceased any further joking and concentrated on the dull issue at hand. Dull because it wasn't about him.

Erika is told by Feldon to bring the mounts to the patrol. Feldon goes to the kybuck stable and rounds them up toward the group. With a smile the Jedi medic trots his kybuck over to Awne. He pats the creature on the shaggy-brown neck.
Feldon: "Amazing, these mounts respond well to the Force....Look!"
Feldon's kybuck huffs his nostrils and approaches Awne. Feldon taps the kybuck's head and it licks Awne's face with a thick tongue. The kybuck's breath was horrible and it stung her nose. The fur on Awne's face stands on end.
The Jedi Master and Lues easily saddle into their mounts.
Lorhas: "Hey now, we don't use the Force for tricks. Though they do listen well to the Force."
Erika: "Everyone get on your rides and follow me!"
The young girl trots to each kybuck and checks to make sure the riders knew what they were doing.
Without notice, Drayden approaches the group and speaks up.
Drayden: "Hey now, I'll be going with you. I'm not letting Erika go by herself and I know the way better."
The chief of security grabs his own mount and rides next to the team who were all saddled up.
Drayden: "Hey I can handle these just good as you guys. They seem to like you a lot maybe you all are naturals at this."
Everyone was now assembled toward the exit of the cavern refuge. All the survivors in the area were watching the mounted people intensely. It was obvious they hadn't seen this type of event for some time.

Woro was glad to hear his name called to be in the first group. He always wanted to be in the midst of the action, even if he was not 100% confident in his riding skills on the kybuck. He selected one of the larger beasts and approached it carefully. Hearing that they responded to the Force, he attempts to communicate with it as he closes the gap. He says the word "friend" in his mind as he first touches the creature, and prepares to mount it.

Uan smiles back at the chiss. She moves over to a crate and checks a flimsiplast sheet.
Uan: "Well, thank you for the nice compliment. However, I have a backlog on my duties. I have to inventory all this equipment and continue to watch over this trandoshan. I doubt we'll have time."
Uan notices as the chiss leaves to get on his kybuck with the others. The woman politely waves goodbye.
Kardoon runs to his new found allies to see they were all on top the kybucks and ready to go. He gets on one and observes they were already trotting out of the entrance. Kardoon had a small conversation with Vor'en about Falsoor.
The wookiee realized that the kybuck didn't really respond to telepathy, however it did respond to instinctive suggestions. Getting the kybuck to follow a command was much like telling your own body to flex your muscles. This could be a dangerous form of control if you got the kybuck to do something it couldn't handle.
After a few moments, the kybucks gallop out of a inclined cavern tunnel back into the open air of Vjun. Morning was now in full swing as daylight trickled through the thick cloud cover. The arid atmosphere caused an acidic taste in everyone's mouth.
Aymaric, Gor, Lues, and Woroken nudged their mounts ahead of the rest of the group. Gor used his map while atop the bucking ride to keep the team oriented toward their destination. As the group covered more and more ground, the terrain became more difficult and rocky. The terrain was heavily sloped while humongous rocks impeded movement. Although, this would only impede movement if you weren't on a kybuck.
The kybucks dashed across the landscape of Vjun with amazing speed and balance. They hopped onto each rock as if they couldn't miss a step. Each person on the kybucks tightened their grip to stay on.
After about a minute of travel, the team of mounts stop at a long and wide chasm. Drayden rears his mount back to the face the others.
Drayden: "Right, this is a dangerous jump. I don't know why Gotu allowed Erika to come. If you don't think you can get your furball to do this jump I would wait here."
Erika kicks her kybuck in the side and it leaps with grace to the other side of the chasm.
Erika: "Come on! What are you guys waiting on? Tee-hee!"

While the farghul had been immensely pleased with the sight of the mount and more so with the cheerfulness of her master, she did not appreciate a fur full of kybuck spit. Needless to say while moving to her own mount she was busy trying to rid her cheek of it.
Once the group had begun the journey, Awne had made sure to keep an eye on her nervous wookiee friend to make sure he was alright on his Kybuck, throwing teases his way in good spirits.
At the chasm, a burst of adrenaline swam into her, the little cub could do it, and so could that shaggy mutt well then so could she! With a grin she pats her Kybuck mount "Come on, lets show them how it's rreally done." and gives it a quick short kick, just to make sure it understood she sends a command through the force for jump.

The wookiee spent most of the ride in silence, attempting to hang onto his mount. The kybuck was even faster than he had expected. He barely even heard Awne's jokes during the ride, he was so focused on staying upright. As he approached the ravine, he slowed unsteadily. Seeing no way around, he knew he had to go with the rest of the team, and attempt the leap. He took a moment to regain his focus and kicked the kybuck into high gear, bent low to grab the creature as best he could as it leaped the crevice.

Choosing his words carefully the Chiss replies " Honestly, I think you all have a far better chance of getting out of here alive then they do, I'm not certain Falsoor will be sending them a rescue any time soon and I'd rather not sit in a cave waiting to die."

Kardoon observes Awne as she speaks, keeping his rear firmly planted in his saddle at the same time. The farghul was genuine as far as he could tell. She seemed really close to her fellow companions and he believed she would do anything for them. There was no kind of deceit in her words and it was obvious she didn't trust him at all. Earning trust out of the farghul could prove to be difficult and time consuming.
As Qwy is the last one across the chasm, the group rallies their kybucks to continue across the vaulted terrain. Once again they hop easily across Vjun's treacherous peaks and tall rocks. After a quick two minutes of travel, Drayden halts the group in a saddle between to two rocky peaks.
Drayden: "The sensor relay should be on the crest of that peak, on the other side."

"Guess we should check out whatÂ´s up ahead. You coming Squirts?"
Not really expecting anyone to protest, the Bothan and the Human started to move ahead, using what skills they had to keep their eyes open, and themselves out of sight. And they kept their weapons ready, just in case they received any more of Vjuns "hospitality".

Gor ascends up from the saddle's difficult terrain with relative ease. Squirts keeps his weapon oriented outwards to cover Gor's movement to the sensor dish. Knowing better to not silhouette himself the bothan travels around the side of the peak. He puts his arm down and digs his feet into the loose ground to help him around the rocky hill. The morning heat was setting in as they went through this climb.
Once on the other side, he saw an astromech droid sized relay dish. It had a cylinder like shape and the color was brown/red, just like the surface of Vjun. There was a small dish whirring in a circular motion on top of the cylinder base. It was likely if you didn't know where this was at that you would see it at all. Gor got closer to the dish as Squirts was observing with interest.
Gor could only see a panel on the side of the sensor pack that would allow him to do anything to it. However, it had no visible means of opening it.

He didnÂ´t have any exceptional idea of what to do next, but trying to get some kind of access to the sensor seemed like a good idea. Motioning back to Squirts, he crouched low next to the cylinder.
"Keep an eye of for any nasty surprises, will you? IÂ´ll try to get a grip of how this thing works"
Carefully, he began to examine the sensor. He was quite careful not to break anything, but he tried to gain access to the sensor in various ways, including trying to open the panel on the side. He was far from an expert on sensor relays, but being in the career he was, he had picked up both one and one hundred pieces of various information, so he did the best he could.

Aymaric had intended on following Gor and Squirts. He had intended on dismounting his Kybuck smoothly and gathering his gear, just like Gor and Squirts. However, his dismount was rougher than he would have liked, and it left him lying on his back with his right foot caught in the stirrup. His embarrasment would have been worse if anyone had noticed, at least he hoped no one noticed. Detangling himself and standing up, he grabs his gear and stands by to assist if the help is needed..

As Vor'en rides up next to where the others had stopped he dismounts and stretches out the kicnks that cropped up from the ride here. "Ok as soon as the others are ready we can head off for the tracking station. Remeber only the four i mentioned before are going to apouch the target and recon. The rest of us will be in resever." He turns to Gor and Awne. "No unesscary risks. In, sucure, and report back. If it gets to hairy get out of there, understood?" Vor'en knows that Awne will either listen to him or just take the risk. Gor on the other hand was alittle crazy but capeable, besides Awne would ull his fat out of the fire and of course there was Lues and Aymaric there to so everything should go well.

Hopping off the kybuck, Woro was extremely happy to be on solid ground. In his periphery, he saw Aymaric struggling to dismount the beast as well, comically getting hung for a brief second. The wookiee smiled, not saying anything out loud that might embarrass the young Falsoor employee.
He hated to be left out of the main squad doing the investigating, but he took the chance to focus and try to sense Mur Eva through the Force, knowing that to do so seemed difficult on this planet.

Awne's kybuck stops with the others as she again sizes up the...Chiss. She humphs and turns to her next destination with the small group "don't think you can rreplace the cubs, Chiss." She sends a glare to him before dropping her feet from the stirrups and pushing herself up out of the saddle with her hands; swinging a leg over the side and jumping down gracefully. She gives the mount a pat and nuzzle before moving to the recovery team giving Vor'en a nod.
"We'll be carreful Vorr, but don't think you can light up a cigarr just because my back is turrned." she grins and pokes her tongue out at him playfully before running off to the others, senses stretched out to search for anything hostile or living.

Gor notices that the panel would require tools to gain access to. He pulls out a thin screwdriver and pries the panel off easily. The open panel reveals a computer port, a small blue screen, and a few multicolored buttons. The screen was off right now and the buttons were likely to control the screen. With Gor's expertise he judged that this sensor relay had security measures to prevent just anyone tampering with it. A personal computer would be needed to access the relay's control by plugging it into the port.
Feldon catches Aymaric hanging from the kybuck saddle.
Feldon: "Watch out for those saddles, they'll jump out and get you! Do be careful when you are riding atop strange animals."
The Jedi Knight rode his kybuck over to Aymaric and helped him down.
Among the group, the wookiee apprentice focused his feelings in order to find Mur Eva. She was farther than they were originally at, though she was still safe and calm. It could make one wonder how this was helping matters to get further away from the person they were rescuing.
Awne also looked around the saddled peaks. There was nothing in this desolate area. Nothing living nor anything of interest save the relay dish. It was all rock and uphill climbs from here.
Lues nodded to Vor'en's order.
Lues: "Hopefully we can scout the area and get right back. We've already found too much life on this planet than what it's worth."

As the panel came loose, and the mechanics underneath was revealed, Gor didnÂ´t find his situation improved by far. It seemed like something a little more advanced than his datapad to plug into this thing. Or at least that had been the thought. But he had been in situations like this before, and just because the thing was built to receive only one type of connection, it wasnÂ´t necessarily incapable of handling anything else. Carefully he began to pry at the connection port, hoping to reveal some of the wiring underneath, that he might be able to rig a temporary connection to his datapad, and at least be able to download part of the relayÂ´s memory banks if he wasnÂ´t able to hook it up to full functionality.

Lues: "I know Woro, I feel the same way. But we have no other leads...and she seems safe enough. If anything we could hopefully extract some useful information from this dish or who it belongs to. I'm just out of ideas, so I'll trust the Force."
At the sensor dish, Gor is able to find a cord that protrudes from the port. He estimates if he unwinds it, the cable could be used to plug into a personal computer. Or, he could try accessing the relay dish by the control interface.

Spotting her he meanders over to her.
"Could you show me how to properly care for this animal? He's carried me awful far and I'd like to make sure he's still in good condition." He looks her over and realizes she may be young but she probably knew more about this line of work than he could ever hope to learn.

*Right, there was a control interface :P* 
Whoever built this thing need to consider alternate application. How is a good hobby mechanic going to be able to mess with it if he requires them to have top-grade equipment to access it? As he let the cables be alone, he started to look at the other things he had found behind the panel. The screen was blank, so he assumed it was shut down. As he started to work with the buttons and the interface to get the thing operative, he hears the voice of other peoples. Not looking up from his work, he just answered casually.
"Well, I found it, now its just a matter of accessing it. You wouldnÂ´t happen to have a portable computer would you?"
While he didnÂ´t show it outward, he had preferred it if the other could just have let him work with the thing until he was done. DidnÂ´t they know you donÂ´t disturb the advance team until they contacted you?

Gor sighed. Someone had been really paranoid when they put this thing here. He guessed heÂ´d have to check to see if anyone had some more advanced equipment that would allow him to access the thing properly, and hopefully crack the code. He also made a mental note to remember to ask for more proper equipment the next time they asked something from him.
He wasnÂ´t sure of the setup for the encryption algorithm, but if it was any kind of secure at all it would take him forever to bruteforce the code manually, unless he got really lucky. And not even *he* had that kind of luck. He picked up his comlink and commed the others.

Arriving at Gor and Squirts shortly after the blue man, Aymaric offers his expert advice. "It's the thing right there." Kneeling down next to Gor and pointing at the blank screen, he manages to ignore the fact that the Chiss handed Gor a computer. "You need to use the screen so you can diagnose the system."

He is relieved to see the cable fits directly into the computer. Gor turns on the computer and tries to ignore any of the personal stuff on the chiss' computer. The bothan types in a few commands to bring up the interface with the relay.
The computer mimics the green screen of the control panel on the relay package. Some text cycles through a couple of languages briefly but the screen then resets to black. A single line prompt appears at the bottom of the screen to the left. It was hard to notice if you weren't looking for it. The screen read:

He hooks the computer up to the relay, and the screen flickers with some information and then goes black, leaving only a single prompt line for him to enter commands. Not much of an improvement it may seem, but at least now he had some way to interact with the system. He looked around among the group. He figured maybe the old Falsoor employees would know something. Of course, they couldnÂ´t even be sure that Falsoor had put this thing there.
"Anyone have a good guess for a password? Keep in mind though that whoever built this crap was paranoid as hell, and it wouldnÂ´t surprise me if itÂ´s a one-shot attempt at the password before this things blocks all access. So unless you feel absolutely certain, IÂ´ll just try to hack this thing"

Woroken sighed as he answered Feldon, "While I know that those that have passed on are with us as a part of the Force, I still have trouble dealing with their deaths. That is why we have to succeed in this mission. We can't let the sacrifices made by our friends be made in vain." He kicked at the ground absentmindedly as he spoke.

"Normally I think she would be overjoyed, as would any of us, about being rescued. However," and he hushed his voice so only Feldon could hear, "we all heard Mur Eva's voice before the attacks on the rooftop. If, somehow, someone is controlling her, or she is not in her right mind, I think we might have a fight on our hands to bring her back." This was the first time Woro had outwardly expressed the thought that he was sure everyone that heard her was thinking.
"And knowing Mur Eva, that would be daunting to say the least." She was probably the finest combatant Woro had ever seen. "But we have a while, it seems before that bridge will have to be crossed. Anyway, do you know anything about sensor relays," he asks the Jedi, looking forward to see the group ahead of them bunched around the contraption.

"Gor, you got that thing figured out yet? Your old CO would like to know." Vor'en was still bored from the waiting. Scanning the area had produced no other life forms other then them so there was nothing to shot at, yet. "You guys even if this gives us what we want we still need to get off this rock in one piece. Any ideas on how to go about that?" "The Starshade is going to take some work, and I really dout that the NR is going to send a team to pull are backsides out of the fire so I would like to hear some option on this." Vor'en liked to have a plan of attack instead of going in gun ablazing, unfortunaty this mission didn't really let him have that option so he worked with what he had. He moves to where he was going to be able to get agood scan and pulls out portable scanner and checks to see if anyone was taking aliking to what they where doing.

Vor'en takes a deeper look into the surrounding hilltops, rocks, and caverns from where he was standing. Nothing, there was absolutely not a living creature in sight. There was nothing of interest either, everything almost all looked the same. There was only reddened rock as far as the eye could see. The daylight had made it easier to see though, but the clouds were still a problem.
Back in the saddle terrain, Feldon takes a moment to sit on the rock and listen to Woroken. He makes sure to keep his voice unheard by the others.
Feldon: "We all remember that Woro. But search your feelings...we heard the voice...but I couldn't feel her presence anywhere near. I'm sure you felt the same. We have only recently felt her presence close...but even then. I....maybe we just heard it wrong over the comlink. The signal was faint and we were high-strung.

But as far as his presence with the Force, it seems extremely unique. I was using my Jedi abilities more than my medicine skills to diagnose him and I'm still at a standstill. Some of the Jedi felt he should of been exiled and it's still under review. However, Lorhas feels that if Lues keeps his life in service as a Jedi we will get much more out of him and we can keep studying his condition. With his prior outbursts, who could tell what would of happened had he been dismissed from the Order? Before he recovered his Force abilities that man was known to act irrationally at any contradiction that occured to him. It's just, I think Lues and Mur Eva had a few select words exchanged that I wish I could of heard. She was acting differently, talking to Knight Van all the time...and then she just disappeared.

"So, can you change with your environment? Does your whole species have this capability, or is it some mutation that has forced your government to exile you? Is it a specific brand of cigar or just any carcinogenic inhalant? You mentioned pure oxygen and it's hilarious effects..."

Next to the sensor dish on the peak, Gor observes the next screen of options. He pushes the status selection. Serial numbers, bars, and pictures of sensor dishes scroll onto the screen. There were twenty sensor packs to count and they were all running at one hundred percent capacity. This was a collection of sensors with their current statuses.

While Gor continuously types commands into the computer, the sensor gives up information freely. On the status screen, he is able to see that the sensor is indeed transmitting information to the other sensors and another source.However, the other source is marked as an "unknown source". So collectively the twenty sensors were gathering information and sending it primarily back to the unknown data source. Gor is able to determine that the sensors were tasked only to do two things: keeping track of heat, emissions, sound, vibration, and other sensors. They also were transmitting the data between each other.
Gor would have to think on what he has just figured out and how it would be useful to their mission.

"IÂ´ll see if I can get a fix on it"
With a full sensor array at his disposal, Gor figures it shouldnÂ´t be too hard to triangulate a position. Or "multipleangulate", or whatever you called it when you used 20 points of origin. While he was at it, he tried running a similar scan to locate the place where the sensors apparently fed their data to. In his curious mind, it seemed like the next logic spot to visit.

Gor 'Ak discovers the task won't be difficult, but with each sensor being encrypted individually it would take some time. He would have to angulate multiple sensors until they led to the right position. But, it shouldn't take longer than 20 minutes.

Gor 'Ak painstakingly angles every sensor dish's data output into each other. The overview reveals that the primary data source was bouncing back into the unknown area that was near here. Gor is able to extract the fact that all the sensor info was coming to a spot near here, at least within a fifty meter radius. He was still not able to to determine what the unknown source was; but whatever it was it was in the immediate area.
Meanwhile, Erika seems to be tending to the resting Kybucks. She was feeding them a few treats. The young girl was patting them on the head and speaking softly.

As he cannot find any trace that the cave had been entered recently, Gor calms down a little. Off course, it could also mean that someone hadnÂ´t been here for a while, and thus was due back soon. He knew the risk was probably slim, but better safe than sorry. As VorÂ´en and Drayden convereses, he moves over to Squirts.
"Look, why donÂ´t you stay behind and keep our backs clear? Find a nice little spot somewhere where you can see but not be seen if you know what I mean. If someone comes this way, notify me. One click means someone you know, and two clicks means someone else"
He pauses and waves his hand at Drayden and Erika.
"If they stick around, I suppose you could keep an eye on them as well, especially him"
Squirts nods and moves of to prepare a good vantage point. Suspecting possible automated defenses inside the cave, Gor draws out his Ion pistol as well, checking its charge. Then he awaits for the rest of the group to get moving.
((Squirts will set up a nice little vantage spot somewhere where he has clear vision of the entrance and its immediate surroundings, but that isnÂ´t too close to the entrance.

The mercenary Squirts nods to Gor 'Ak without question. One would wonder now that Sarin had been killed why Squirts would even want to stick around, the promise of credits perhaps? Or maybe just the thrill of adventure or combat. Maybe Squirts knew nothing else besides fighting or simply had nothing better to do.

Lues picks up the rate of march as the group follows tightly behind him. Typical SpecForces tactics for moving through darkness was to get into a close file. Walking this close together prevented no one getting lost or falling over and getting hurt. So, the Jedi and assorted team members followed the instruction of Sergeant Vor'en and got into a line while they walked.
After a number of steps downhill in the narrow cavern, you notice it gets considerably darker. The cave was damp and windy. The air was cool and was a nice change to the morning heat of the outside atmosphere. This cavern tunnel seemed to go on for a while and it would take some time to cover its distance. It had no turns or twists to it. The cavern tunnel was a straight shot downwards with slippery stones and jagged rocks. Those without night vision capabilities found it was troublesome to even see their hand in front of them.
The point man of the element, Lues, pulls out and ignites his bright blue lightsaber. He held it in front of him to make sure he didn't fall and could guide the unit in the right direction. After about eight minutes of slow walking, the group can see illumination at the end of the rocky passage. It appeared to be an opening to daylight. The group had traveled into a mountain and was descending further down.
The Jedi Knight whispered to Awne who was on point behind him.
Lues: "Mur Eva has been through here, I'm certain of it."
Despite the Jedi's words, it remained to be seen whether or not anyone still had faith in his abilities to track their missing friend.

Woroken shuts his eyes and stretches out with the Force. Amidst the energy in the cavern, the wookiee felt Mur Eva's aura lingering here. As if she had glided through the tunnel like a ghost, leaving a shadow that was barely detectable. Although it gave him an eerie feeling, he understood why Lues would have trouble tracking her through here. Something wasn't right...which could of been obvious had he been using his feelings alone. The Force was only reassuring him that things were out of place. He was not only detecting Mur Eva, he is sensing that something bad is going to happen.

"Mur Eva has been through here, I'm certain of it." *Is that so Masterr?* she thinks to herself, glancing to the cavern walls...those were walls weren't they? a sigh escapes her, she couldn't even see the damn walls.
She stretches out her senses to see just what it was the Jedi sensed, wondering if they were simply following a ghost or not. Shifting slightly she moves to walk just that much closer to the jedi master, it's not that she hated caves really, it was just that this whole journey wasn't sitting right with her, and now being in a cave this dark that she couldn't see anything in, that had no turns to it, that was so narrow, that feeling of 'not right' was coming back full force.

Lues looks down at the rocky ground, a little uncertain.
Lues Van: "Uh....I'm not sure. It was a while ago."
The Jedi Knight snaps to as Vor'en wants to investigate the daylight opening. The two men cautiously approach the illumination with their weapons ready. The Jedi chuckles before they even get there, he puts his hand on the man's rifle to lower it.
Lues: "Relax, nothing over here...just a bridge of some sort."
Sgt. Vor'en realizes that they were now standing in a very long tubular bridge. The bridge connected one rock wall to another rock wall and was completely enclosed. The transparisteel bridge allowed you to see all around. They were standing over a gorge...and you estimate this is close to the area that they crossed with Kybucks minutes ago. After Vor'en looks to end of the tunnel he deems it's safe and signals the rest of the patrol to move out.
While walking across the transparisteel tunnel, you notice the ground is smooth and partially slippery. Why someone would construct a bridge like this was beyond your understanding for the moment. Nevertheless, the group spans the bridge in around a minute. Once on the other side of the gorge, they arrive in another cavern tunnel similar to the last.
This cavern was much darker and steeper. It seemed where everyone was standing that it would be a considerable walk to where you were going. The group descends from the daylight tunnel into the darkness. After a few moments of arduous stepping down and keeping their balance on the slippery rocks, Woroken has trouble keeping his footing as he nearly falls. The wookiee reaches out to the side to grab the wall in this narrow tunnel. He's able to hold his weight so he doesn't fall. *Successful acrobatics check.* While keeping his balance, the wookiee knocks a stone loose and it tumbles down the steep incline. Each time the rock bounced it made a loud clacking noise...until it finally hit the bottom of the tunnel.
In the distance, you all hear someone speak in basic. The voice penetrated the darkness of the cavern tunnel.
Voice: "Did you hear something?"
Almost at the same time of hearing the voice... Awne is able to hear another person speaking to her.

"Sorry," he growl/whispers to the rest of the group, hearing the rock fall down the deep cavern, trying to keep his voice low, as he contemporaneously detects some strange voice fairly close by ask a question in basic. He immediately steadies himself and holds still to attempt to hear any other conversation from teh stranger.

Awne could hear the voices from the bottom of the cavern. With her low-light vision, she could see the rock floor even out about 20 feet below. The tunnel appeared to open up into a bigger area. That's where the voices were coming from. However, the farghul could not see into the area past the tunnel they were in.

Everyone could notice that at the bottom of the rock tunnel, was a source of light that was getting easier to see through the darkness. Someone was walking to the edge of the tunnel with an illumination device. It was obvious that the creature had heard the falling rock and was going to investigate the noise. A decision would have to be made on what to do next. The cavern could feel the tension of anticipation build.

The wookiee Jedi listened to the orders from Vor'en and pushes himself against the nearest wall, attempting to gain whatever cover possible from the approaching stranger, while simultaneously attempting to stay out of the line of vision of the party to the light that was moving nearer and nearer.

Vor'en realizes that the best option tactically speaking would be to back up the cavern tunnel some. Once they had backed up, he could get all his men in the prone and observe the creature with some cover/concealment from the rocks. If the creature was hostile, he was in a fatal funnel and all the weapon fire would be channeled into that one opening. If his men were in the prone and all engaged that funnel, it would give his squad the advantage by a landslide. The hostile creature would have to shoot up into the darkness and Vor's squad could shoot down with minimal shot placement error.
After instantly rehearsing the plan in his mind, Sergeant Vor'en orders the squad up the tunnel and sets them in the prone. Everyone quickly went silent and watched the tunnel opening at the bottom. The group was about 46 meters away from the cavern opening. Awne is able to spot the silhouette of a human with a blaster rifle investigating the fallen rock. She can't make out his clothing or whether he's wearing armor, but his rifle did have a glow rod attached to it.
The squad notices the light from the glow rod sweep over the tunnel where they were laying down in. He was scanning the cavern for anything out of the ordinary. However, he didn't appear to notice anyone as you were all hugging the ground. The group was as still as statues at the light glanced over their bodies.

"Clumsy Wookie." kardoon thinks to himself, this cave was creepy enough without him alerting everything that they were there. In his position behind everyone he instructs his droids to aim down the tunnel but under no circumstances are they to fire a shot unless the sargeant ordered it, with that he slides his own blaster pistol partway out of the holster and waits. This was probably the most terrifying and exciting thing he'd ever done, and as the light approached them his terror only built up. "Calm down" he think to himself after he realizes his hands are shaking almost uncontrollably.

Seeing him perfectly in the near darkness the man appears a little nervous and keeps glancing in the direction of the party. "IF no one else is going to do this I guess I'll start it out." kardoon thinks to himself.

Kardoon steadily squeezes the trigger of his sporting pistol. A loud crack of blasterfire rips through the cavern tunnel. Red energy illuminates the area around Kardoon as everyone is startled. The bolt strikes the man square in the stomach and he lets out a groan of agony. Awne and Kardoon watch as the man stumbles over...dropping his weapon to the rocky ground with a clatter. Within seconds the man falls over, disabled completely. The man was unable to attempt any kind of resistance to the attack.
A voice can be heard in the distance, though you are unable to tell what the voice is saying. The sound was too far away to understand what just what was being said. The noise was behind the opening at the bottom of the cavern, likely in the area you can't see at the moment. The Jedi could sense each other's thoughts.

Gor 'Ak swiftly but quietly steps down the tunnel rocks toward the entryway so he could get a view of what was going on. He passes where Kardoon was moving and gets close to the entrance. The bothan easily sits into the prone behind a sizable rock and watches the entrance. From here, he couldn't see into the whole area of the entryway, but he could tell that the inside was illuminated partially.
The bothan strains his eyes on the fallen human to see that he was wearing normal civilian clothing and appeared to have no special equipment. The clothing seemed typical of a two-bit thug with a holster and padded vest. His rifle lay next to his unmoving body. After a few moments, another human dressed in standard clothing walks into the entrance. Gor 'Ak noticed that he looked very nervous and haphazardly checked the other fallen human. After he checked over the incapacitated human; he gasped, then he looked into the tunnel and shouted. This human was also armed with a blaster rifle, though he wasn't using a glow rod.

Creeping closer to the entrance, Gor keeps his pistol at the ready. Casting wary glances at the rest of the party - particularly the trigger-happy Chiss - to see what theyÂ´ll do. He figures heÂ´d better be fast if someone else were to come through that entrance.

Kardoon walks into the entrance next to the two bodies. The chiss quickly looks over the interior past the entrance and notices that this area is more expansive than the tunnel. It was about 25 feet wide and 30 feet deep... and the rock ceiling was high above him. Near the end of the cavern room was what appeared to be a lift. Kardoon had no problems looking into this room because there was two large glow lamps flanking the lift like structure. The lift had four metallic railings sitting on each corner, and one of the corners had a control panel.
The chiss couldn't see anything moving in the room and it was as quiet as a graveyard in there. He didn't walk into the room however. The blue humanoid took a knee next to the bodies and observed that the first one he shot was still breathing slowly. He was definitely unconscious though and likely to not put up any resistance. He looked at their two rifles and determined that they were older models. These weapons were probably used for hunting animals more than people, but still would likely be just as effective in combat. One rifle had a glow rod attached to it and could be activated to illuminate things while never taking your hand off your weapon. The chiss also finds that both men have about 60 credits on them.

Woro stood up, slightly drained from his attempt to heal the wounds of the human. "Someone needs to explain to the Chiss that we are not assassins," he says. Upon saying that he recalled that the human appeared to be raching for something before entering his death throes. He bent back down to see if he could find what the human might have been reaching for, hoping it was some sort of information about what this facility was.

Gor 'Ak takes his time to do a diligent search of the new area they had just entered. However, he finds nothing in the room except the lift and the two glow rods. All the room appeared to be was a big opening in this cavern they were in. Nothing but rocks and somewhat damp walls. One might wonder what the humans were doing up here before they were killed.
Woroken thought to himself about the human who had just passed away. He was reaching for something, but the person didn't have much on him besides credits and the weapon that Kardoon picked up. Whatever he was reaching for, he was doing it in a desperate manner.
The two Jedi carefully watched Awne to see if she was going to assault Kardoon again. Kel-Yun Lorhas spoke out to the Jedi padawan.

As he finished his search and came to the conclusion that there was nothing at all of interest in the room, Gor once again spat a low curse at the ChissÂ´s idiotic actions. Deciding that they probably needed to come to terms with a few things before they proceeded, he walked over to the others. Casting glances in turn over Awne, Kardoon and the Jedi, he spoke up without a hint of irritation or annoyance in his voice. He was simply stating facts.
"If you ainÂ´t going to let her have him, can I take over? I havenÂ´t had much experience with Chiss, but from what IÂ´ve heard, theyÂ´re supposed to possess an intellectual capacity above average of the common galactic species. Just our luck to get stuck with the exception to that rule. Instead of being able to extract useful information about, say, this tunnel complex, what those guards were doing here or what lies up that elevator, we are now stuck with two dead bodies that will probably be missed soon enough. So I sincerely hope you learned something useful from blasting them, because I sure as hell didnÂ´t"

Awne growls at the Chiss as he moves away, her arms still crossed in an effort to restrain herself from hitting him again, or killing him. Her thoughts were to far racing to make careful judgment.
Glancing to Lues and Lorhas that seemed to be staring at her with disappointment she only narrowed her eyes and refrained from hissing, though a faint growl escaped her as she moved to the wookiee and stood beside him. She knew that the calming presence of the big furry Jedi would calm her and if need be, he was strong enough to stop her from doing something they would *really* disapprove of.
"He had it coming, we had no way of knowing if they would have firred up herre, the firrst one was rreturrning to the otherrs with no knowledge of us, now therre's two dead and when they don't rreturrn ourr prresence will be alerrted."

" And what were you planning on doing with them after your little party? letting them go, tying them up or killing them, or taking them with us? any of those sound like great ideas."
" I wasnt 100% sure they had not seen us, and as one of the few individuals here that can see in the dark I took it upon myself to resolve the situation, and if anyone noticed they dont have comlinks so they couldnt have called for help. Which means they probably have a check in spot, which since they're all the way down here would probably farther away, you all arguing with me is just wasting time getting to said spot before they dont check in, and i could have explained all this if your're farghul friend had just asked instead of using me as a blue punching bag."

If it's a matter of trust to the chiss, I'd advise you to assign a watch to him or send him on his way. We need to get moving. Standing here and flaming emotions does nothing but give any potential opposition the advantage. It also does not aid in finding Mur Eva or gathering information on Falsoor.

Awne's claws begin to dig into her own arms, a visible effort of how much she was trying to restrain herself, even the calming actions of the Wookiee weren't helping to quell the anger that was rising again inside her. Growling at the Chiss her body was tensed, she couldn't even think of the training she had to help put her mind at rest. She could only remember once lose her temper like this and that was before she began training..
"You arren't the only one who can see in the darrk you thick headed idiot, I can too and he was turrning to go back! he hadn't spotted us you killed an innocent human who may have had nothing to do in this caverrn! he was on a smoke brreak you pile of rrancorr dung!"
She bites her tounge to stop talking when Lorhas spoke, then when Lues spoke. She looks over to him, the anger in her eyes before turning away. She was digging her nails into her arm to keep from lashing out, pulling now out of desperation for memories of home to calm her mind and spirit. Trying to picture every section of the training grounds that was her home, anything to keep her mind off of the Chiss.

Despite the current tension in the group, they all gathered atop the battered lift. While the lift activated, Awne could not help but to notice Feldon watching her closely. All the dirt on the man's face could not begin to hide the look of disappointment that was obvious. She got a nagging feeling that he was displeased with the way she was handling her emotions. Maybe she was mistaken though...he could be just upset with the situation in general. Her emotions made it difficult to get a clear grasp on her master's feelings. This was strange to her, as sometimes she was able to sense her master just as well as she could herself.
After the switch was pushed on the lift, a loud mechanical creaking sound echoes throughout the cavern. The ground beneath the group jolts as they descend further into the cavern. After a few seconds, they are plunged into the darkness. Everyone feels the cool air whooshing on their skin as they drop briskly into the unknown. Only the chiss and the farghul could still watch the looks on the group's faces. Indeed, everyone had grown tired in this mission.
After about a minute, light permeates everyone's eyes as they view a well-lit, but small cavernous area. This place was similar to the one they just left. There appeared to be nothing in here but glow lamps and lights fixed into the walls. The only sound you hear after the lift settles is the soft hum of lamps next to the unit. There was nowhere to go but straight ahead. The group did so after they formed back up with the usual people on point in the formation.
They were in a long tunnel now, but there was illumination at the other end so it made for decent visibility. As you get closer to the end of the tunnel, you can see into another opening. This area was brighter than the last...and you can see a humongous door. However, from where you are standing in the narrow tunnel you can see nothing else.
Lues stopped the group and turned around. He took a knee and made sure to whisper to Awne who was next to him.
Lues: "I believe there's trouble in there. Pass it back to Sergeant Vor'en."

Now that she was calm, she didn't miss the look on her master's face, which rose questions, was it disappointment in his eyes at her? was it for the mission? why did she have such trouble sensing him now? She felt shame, she should have been better able to control herself but...she sighs as they stood in the lift, lowering her head to watch the surroundings and the others, eyes stray mostly to her master, she had disappointed him, how could she not have with how she acted? he tried so hard to quell that anger, to teach her how to push it aside and what does she do? hit a member of the team..threaten to kill him even.
Awne sighs as the move down the tunnel, doing her best to stop her thoughts as they move. At Lues's words she nods and flips her comlink to Vor'en's channel "Vorr..Lues believe's therre's trrouble ahead, a larrge doorr is ahead of us, what arre yourr orrderrs?"

Glancing around the lift, Kardoon thinks to himself, wondering if his actions were justified, no he couldnt question himself, if there was even the remote possibility that they had spotted them and just pretended not to they would have had to fight alot more later on. If everyone wanted to think he was stupid so be it, he'd do everything in his power to stay alive, even if what he considred preemptive they considered reckless. He'd have to be wary of the Farghul though,a slight smile cross's his lips causing the cuts on his face to crinkle and he winced lightly, could probably think of a way to use her temper to his advantage later on.

However, the farghul could not see a door control panel or anything like that from in here. Although she wasn't sure, the door appeared to made from quadanium steel.

It was as dead in life as any other place they had been in Vjun. However, the farghul is able to detect one creature past the door. The life force radiated in her mind despite the bleak surroundings around the creature.
Sergeant Vor'en pulled up his datapad which was connected to his scanner on his belt. He toggled the keys to do a sweep of the area ahead of them. No life forms were present, but there was motion at least 26 feet away from them. 4 blips were making motion on the soldier's datapad.

Lues: "Got to hand it to him, he's got courage and initiative."
The chiss gets low as he stops at the tunnel exit. He positions himself in the prone then arches on his toes and hands to look into the area with the door. He quickly sweeps his head to notice that the area was quite large and relatively empty. Empty, except for one blaster turret in each corner. There were four corners to this room and the turrets could cover the room completely with interlocking fields of fire. After about two seconds the chiss scoots back into the tunnel.

Turning to the Chiss, he absently pulled out his Ion blaster and checked its charge again.
"These turrets, whats the angle of fire they can cover? Are they restricted to two dimensions, or can they rotate their blasters vertically as well? And could you get an approximate of the distances between them?"

Vor'en watched Kardoon draw out what he saw. "So is there anyway around these. We don't have the smoke grenades to use. We have limited explosives but in hear that would be a bad idea. So I guess I will bow to you and Gor on this one." Vor'en looks for Master Lorhas. "Master Lorhas you have any ideas to get use though that door? Lues you got something? Feldon?" Vor'en was out of his league on this one. Sure he could blow a large hole in the door but the shock wave and blaster would bring the rest of the tunnel down around there ears. No this needs a more gentle touch. So he would bow to others to get past the problem.

Lues Van cracks a smile at Sergeant Vor'en.
Lues: "Well, even if we sneak past those turrets, we're likely to alert something on down the lines with these numbers. If you ask me, I say we just raid the place. It gives us the advantage of confusion and surprise as opposed to waiting to get caught."
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Yes, but we don't even know if they're hostile or evil. We could be attacking someone who doesn't deserve it."
Feldon: "Are you saying we go knock on the door and find out?"
Lues:"No way, I sense that this place is definitely malicious."
The Jedi Master frowns at the situation and runs his hand through his short brown hair. He looks over to Sergeant Vor'en.
Lorhas: "Well, if they're evil...we have to decide whether to sneak in or just attack. We don't even know if they're alerted from the two humans dying earlier. We feel they're evil, but our feelings have misled us here on Vjun. I would advise stealth tactics to get to Mur Eva. But ultimately our course of action lies upon your shoulders. We can only advise you."
Lues seemed to be enjoying the situation.
Lues: "If you want to raid...we can create a distraction for you to go in and handle everything else. Though we can only see one way into the complex that we know of."
Feldon: "Of course, if your team comes up with something better we'll go with that too. Nevertheless, I don't think we need to discuss this too long under present circumstances."

Sergeant Vor'en was analyzing the plan in his head. However, he was having trouble getting over the pain from the sniper's blaster wound that had been put on his chest. It was causing him great agony and made it difficult to focus on the mission. He instinctively grabbed his chest to attempt to soothe the hurt. The fact he hadn't eaten yet was not making it easier to cope with the injury. Now that he thought about it, he was lucky to even be alive.

Kardoon notices that the sentry guns are making a sweeping pattern, but there are gaps in the coverage, if you timed walking through it right you could make it to the door, he also noticed if that the gaps made it probable for someone to be able to get behind it to deactiveate it.
Kardoon makes his way back to Vor'en "Their are gaps in the sensor fields, if you time it right you can get to the door, or I could try to get behind the guns and deactivate them, but I'd need a security kit and someone backing me up from the tunnel to attempt it."

The Republic SpecForces soldier remembered hard to his training. However, he ended up thinking more about his days in combat as a part of the Remnant. He had mostly done textbook and drills training with the Republic, but his Imperial days is when he gained the most real-world experience. He had been wounded before, but not from a chest shot. Luckily, the vest he was wearing absorbed most of the damage. Vor'en took a deep breath and focused.
If they were going to assault, he had no problems remembering how to do this. In his lessons from the Imperials; there were two types of areas to clear, framed and non-framed. The place they would be dealing with was framed. That meant the Sergeant would have to worry about corners, overhead openings, doorways, explosives, breaching, and obstacles. The most disturbing part was, it was close-quarters combat. This could be easier with power supply cut, but not many of them had low-light capabilities.
Vor'en knew that in battle close-quarters meant high casualties, as there was no ground to retreat. This veteran knew that close-quarters is the last thing you wanted, short of artillery or air support being called in right on your head. They would have to clear the area quickly and set up a casualty collection in the first or safest room. Each room would have to be cleared smoothly and by the numbers until their objectives were met. They would have to keep the momentum all the way up until they found Mur Eva and gathered the intelligence on Falsoor.
So In essence, Lues Van idea seemed to coincide with his. The Jedi could create a distraction, giving his raiding team less pressure to worry about. The Jedi would go on a warpath big enough to let them walk by as if it were a stroll in the park, or so he hoped. But, he'd have to think through his collection of knowledge and solidify his plan quickly.
The Jedi would go in first, and the raiding team could go in a few minutes/seconds later.
His wound had worsened though, it felt like it was infected. A part of the strategy might to get treatment before commencing the assault or simply staying behind.

Gor shook his head. Sadly the Chiss was right, theyÂ´d need better tools than they had available if they were to disable those turrets by anything other than brute force. He made another mental note to make sure he was properly equipped the next time.
As another plan began to form, he warily nodded in agreement. In his experience, this was one of the worst ways to tackle this kind of defenses, but as the situation was set, they didnÂ´t seem to have that much of a choice. He crept as close to the room with the turrets as he dared, taking a look inside to try and find something that could help them in their assault.

Gor 'Ak observed the sentry guns by peeking his head out of the small cavern tunnel. He noticed that the guns were slowly panning back and forth. Two guns were at least 15 meters away from him on his flanks and the others were roughly 25 meters on the opposite side. The opposite sided guns flanked the large door by about 12 meters. All four of the guns appeared to be actively scanning. The door was 25 meters away.
Something else caught Gor's eye though. There appeared to be a ventilation shaft on the left side of the door as he was facing it. It was near the top of the cavern's ceiling and probably be climbed to with the rock wall next to the door. He also noticed a door panel with a screen next to it. This control was near the door.

How long had it been since he had dismissed Squirts to work as a sentry to keep them from getting caught from behind unaware. However, with Lorhas there as well, he was certain things would work fine.
"Qwy, Aymaric, stick to the rear, but be ready to take on any casualties. Sarge, you keep back as well. The rest of you, letÂ´s do what the Wookie said. Once the Jedi are in, we fan out and fire at will. May the Force be with us"

Gor's instinct tells them that with the Jedi leading the diversion attack, things should go well initially. However, he feels that later more responsibility will fall on the assault team to achieve success in their mission. He gives the signal to Lues Van. The two Jedi get to the edge of the opening and ready their lightsabers.
Using the power of the Force, the two Jedi somersault into the center of the area with the large door. Small pebbles shoot out in each direction as they land hard. They had centered themselves back-to-back facing the sentry guns. Their brilliant lightsabers ignite like colorful beacons in the relative darkness.
Master Lorhas is the first to strike as he lowers his green lightsaber to use the Force. The sentry gun flanking the door is ripped out of the ground and sent flying to the gun on the other side. The airborne sentry gun strikes the other one at a high velocity. Both guns are destroyed completely before even firing a shot.
Lues Van mimics Lorhas' attack and crushes the sentry guns closest to the opening. The Jedi Knight then promptly scans the area and speaks to his companion behind him.
Lues: "Turrets destroyed. What's next?"
Lorhas: "Breach the door with our weapons."
The Jedi Master speaks loudly into the tunnel.
Lorhas: "Wait for our signal before you make your entry."
Lues Van: "Make sure to gather near the lift."
With that, Lorhas impales his lightsaber into the large door and begins cutting a clean circle into the surface. After a man-sized hole is cut; Lorhas explodes with the Force and pushes the metal through the hole. The two Jedi promptly disappear out of sight as they enter the complex.

Feldon takes his field pack and sets it down near the lift as the two Jedi had entered the complex. He stretches his arms and shoulders, gesturing for Vor'en to come sit down on a rock near the lift. Feldon unstraps Vor'en's blast vest to look at the patched wound from the sniper shot.
Feldon: "Hmm, looks like its been infected. Let me try this."
The Jedi Knight places his hand on Vor's forehead. The soldier feels a rejuvenating energy circulating throughout his body and it seems to temporary relieve the queasiness he was feeling. The pain subsided just a little more than what he had been coping with. The young Jedi takes a seat after healing Vor and lets out a sigh.
Feldon: "Well, no matter the power of the Force...you still need bed rest and some food. I can stabilize you somewhat but your body needs to gain nutrients and repair itself naturally. When we have to assault I need to watch over you. Don't get yourself involved too much as you would only endanger yourself and others."

After a few moments, the lift arrives back down at the bottom with the assault team. You are all relieved to see that it was the mercenary, Squirts. The rough looking man strode off the lift as if nothing was going on.
Squirts: "I couldn't get a clear transmission back to Gor, so I decided to follow you. What's happening?"
Feldon quickly fills the mercenary in on the plans to assault.
Squirts: "Ha, I love a good fight. Show where me to shoot and you got it."
Feldon: "Well, you're staying for here for security on the casualty collection area."
The mercenary frowned and agreed.
Squirts: "I got to stay here with fish head? The selkath? Too boring. Don't know why I started following you guys anyways."
Once the casualty area was set and Aymaric had set up his field medicine equipment; Gor ordered the remaining personnel into formation. Awne took point as they proceeded down the tunnel towards the complex entryway. The farghul walked with her hands posed to keep the Force veil over the group. Once at the large door, Gor 'Ak raised his weapon and nodded for the team to make entry. Awne was the first person in, followed by Woroken and Kardoon. The rest of the unit followed through the hole that the Jedi had carved.
The room you walk into was large and appeared to be a reception area. The reception room was bright, shining, and radiated with a brilliant white color. The white was blinding to you at first as your eyes adjusted. It was pristine and appeared to be sterile. A receptionist console was set up in the center, and there was a silver 3P0 protocol droid behind it. The droid appeared to be completely oblivious to your presence. Behind the droid; by about 25 feet, was a closed lift that was residing next to a control panel. There were walls that led to hallways on the left and right sides. As the unit quickly scans the surrounding area for threats, they notice the sound of blaster fire coming from the right hallway. The chaotic ambiance had gotten louder from when they had heard it outside.
Just as Vor'en walks into the room with Feldon, everyone spots a droid hovering in from the right hallway. It had two claw appendages and had a flat surface in which to carry cargo. It was utilizing repulsors to glide quickly to the lift. On top of the droid, you saw a dead human on top wearing lab clothing. This droid did not see you either.

The Jedi had changed some what as well. He was more sure of himself now. "Well we had better see what Gor and Lues have gotten into." Vor'en continues making his way to the door when he see the driod carry out something. It could have been a body from the look of it but he wasn't sure. It also puzzled him why the droid didn't seem to pay attention to tham at all. Sensors must be damaged or something. As the driod moves further away and he is sure it is gone. He looks for Gor.

He was a little worried that the Chiss was behind him, rather than in his line of sight, but the Chiss hadn't fired at any of THEM yet, at least.
Hearing the blaster fire to the right, he instinctively drifted a bit in that direction, but stopped himself waiting for Awne to lead the way, not wanting to expose their position which was being expertly hidden through the Force.

She sees a column of doorways that where just as white as the surrounding environment. The door column was squared and parallel to the other doors. At the end of the hallway, was another door. This hallway wasn't that long but was littered with doors. Obviously, there were a lot of points of interest in this complex to investigate. The farghul also spots a destroyed droid with a blaster rifle by its side. *Knowledge: Technology*. It appears as if the Jedi had cut it down. However, she could not actually see where the Jedi were at, but they had to be in one of the rooms. She is able to spot a security camera overhead just above the door.

Awne looks around the room quickly, doors, a destroyed droid, and more doors and columns and...oh hell. She ducks her head back and sighs, camera, great.
She looks to the wookiee and the others mumbling as quietly as she could what she saw. Question was now how to get past that camera so they could find the other jedi. She could still feel her masters disappointment in her, it...made her feel so sad, that she had let him down so badly that now that seemed all he could feel towards her, disappointment and an underlining respect for her abilities. She would have to speak to him soon, and try to make this right.

Woro, as quietly as possible for a wookiee, offered his only thought to Awne, namely dropping the "screen" and confronting the enemy head on. "It's got us this far, but we have to get to the others, and they have been seen already, I bet," he whispered to his farghul friend.

The droid hovers to the lift completely unaware of the assault team who were masked in the Force. The droid pushes a button on the lift panel with its hand appendage and promptly descends from the reception area. The droid had been carrying a corpse of what appeared to be some type of scholar/scientist.

Awne sighs softly and nods her head. Confronting the enemy seemed the best chance since she didn't think her haze would cover them in front of a camera. She nods her head again as a sign to get ready, if they were going to drop the haze then she would do it when they were ready for the fight.

He turned around to the rest of the assault team, and caught their attention. He ointed to the camera and pointed to himself. After catching the Chiss's attention. he wordlessly pointed at the droid and then toward the Chiss. He pointed at the rest of the team and the hall to the right. He turned back, and readied for Awne's instruction.

He catches the wookie gesturing to him, then point to the droid lift coming down the hall, Kardoon nods in recognition and readies his weapon. he looks the droid over closely to see what kind it was and if there were any weak points he could discover.

The rusted silver droid behind the reception counter was a standard 3PO protocol droid. The assault team would kill it easily. However, protocol droids were known to speak a little too much by human standards. Kardoon knew by the droid's behavior that it could be of interest to talk to the droid if need be. These droids were also infamous for telling you too much of what you didn't want to know either.
The hovering droid that had just left the reception room was none other than a HV-7 Loading Droid. A somewhat newer droid type by a company that has had a bad history. Baktoid Industrial Systems had designed it and they are now in mass production. The droid's weakness tactically is that it had absolutely no shields or armor. Its integrity was not built for damage and it was likely that you could destroy it by any means in a blink of an eye.
While the assault team continues its search of the reception room, a beeping is heard on the reception desk. The protocol droid flips a switch and speaks.
Protocol Droid: "Ah yes, Master Deacon. It seems we have had a level 1 security breach. Two intruders penetrated the blast door and proceeded down the personnel wing."
After a moment, an ambiguous transmission is heard by the team. The droid responds in turn.
Protocol Droid: "No master, I don't see why anyone would have issues like that with a mining guild. But, our security should handle the matter promptly. I will keep you informed."

Hearing Vor's voice over the com, and watching Kardoon burst forward, the wookiee figures the element of surprise is now gone. He quickly moves to the camera, and cleaves into it with his ignited lightsaber. "That was amazing, Awne--you've got to teach me that some day," he says clearing admiring the Force ability the farghul had exhibited. After making sure the camera was no longer operational, he took off down the corridor after the sounds of blaster fire where Leus and Lorhas advanced.

Protocol droid: "Oh my, I'm hearing things! I must need maintenance...I hope my audioreceptors are up to standard. Myra did seem to be a little too busy to take care of me. I need to get off this rock or I'll end up a junk pile."
The droid looked around as if to spot something, but he went back to his business on the reception computer, as if Kardoon wasn't there.

The unaware droid never knew what was coming as his head shot off from the blaster discharge. The protocol droid went out with a loud bang. The rest of the body slid across the smooth floor and collided against the wall with a metallic clank. Gor 'Ak didn't even get to say anything by the time the droid was destroyed. *No Force Point burn.*
Once Kardoon's eyes confirmed the droid was down, they wandered up near the ceiling and spotted something of concern.
There was an amalgamation of white pipes, tubes, and wiring running across the corners of the ceiling. This particular configuration reminded him of an installation that required much power to operate and something else to run utility devices. If his suspicion was correct, the environment they were in could be potentially hazardous. It could really be dangerous if the place was a mining compound. He could look up in the reception computer what was being cycled throughout the facility.

Kardoon looks at the the main screen that the protocol droid had been viewing. The text was in Basic and it was flashing red. It seemed the silent alarm had been activated and the computer was locked out. There were many other controls that the chiss saw; he gathered it was to control security, communications, and power relaying. The screen read as follows:
12th Mining Guild
LEVEL 1 SECURITY ALERT...
ENTER VOICEPRINT AND CODE CYLINDER TO CANCEL ALERT
The chiss would be unable to do anything except the most routine of functions unless he could slice the computer. Nevertheless, the chiss goes to the opposite end of the room to get a look at the pipes running across the ceiling. He observed that the pipes/tubes ran tibanna gas and coolant through it. There were also various power lines in conjunction with the service pipes. The chiss derived it was for running a very industrial operation.
The wookiee padawan, despite the group's interest with the reception area, broke into a sprint down the long right wing. This area was as blinding as the reception room. The smooth and slick floor of the hall reminded the apprentice he could slip if he wasn't careful. He noticed pipes and tubes overhead on the ceiling. The pipes seemed to detract from the overall pristine look of the complex. There didn't appear to be anymore holocameras in here either. He listened for the sound of combat to guide him to his comrades.
The wookiee's ear guided him to double-gray doors with a sign overhead lit-up in Basic. The sign read, "Staff Room". He listened and felt into the room. His friends were in there and no doubt holding their own. He felt no fear in the Jedi, he could feel only controlled emotions. However, the weapon fire in there did not sound like typical blasters. *Knowledge Technology as a reaction.*

Woroken listened intently at the double doors, and heard combat, that much he was sure of. He looked over his shoulder back towards the remainder of the group. It sounded like things were still okay back there. He hated that he had left the Chiss alone after promising Awne that he would watch out for him, but to be honest Woro knew he was not much help at all in an investigation. Besides, Gor seemed to be perfect in such a situation, and Feldon and Vor were coming in to help as well. Woro was much better pressing the action. As such, he took his ignited lightsaber, and attempted to cut through the double doors. Doing so, Woro attempted to find Lorhas through the Force, and send a message: "I'm coming."

He immediately stopped his course of action and looked around to make sure no one was near him. Seeing that he was alone, he took a moment to remember why he and the team were there: Mur Eva. As always, Lorhas was right.
Woro had not even thought to attempt to detect her presence in the current location. He closed his eyes, and reached out throughout the entire complex, attempting to glean any sign of Mur Eva's thoughts or emotions nearby.

Woro once again sought out help from the Force. He reached with all his feelings but he was getting dull feedback. While he was channeling his thoughts, he felt a discreet disturbance in the Force. The padawan had to wonder if the others felt this as well. This disturbance, coupled with the dull sensation, seemed to be blocking his perception of Mur Eva.
Suddenly, an image of Mur Eva popped into his head. Her face was as calm as ever. She smiled at the wookiee and motioned to come to her. Just when he could feel a link to her, the Jedi Knight's face turned to a horrible monstrosity of snarling teeth, flowing hair, and yellow eyes. Woroken lost the link to his friend and was knocked over in the hallway. The wookiee slid across the hall and came to a halt after about two seconds. The slide he experienced was similar to a Force Push but by the likes of a very experienced individual. This type of vision he felt through the Force was disturbing but interesting at the same time.
Back in the reception room, Kardoon continued with his description of the environmental hazards. Feldon seemed to take note of the inherent danger.
Feldon: "Well, would my lightsaber present a problem?"
The Jedi smiled and then shot his head over quickly to the left hallway door that whooshed open. Twelve rough-looking individuals funneled into the room and quickly fanned out around the assault team. A Rodian armed with a rifle speaks in Rodese to another male human.
Human: "Yea, looks like we got visitors! We don't see much of those in these parts. These must be the ones who just destroyed our holocamera."
Human 2: "I have to say, you're not very lucky stumbling in here."
Human Female: "Shut up Dylan...Now listen up! I don't care what all of you are doing here, just turn around and go back the way you came. This is private property and you have no right to be here!"
The woman had an eye patch and appeared to be the ringleader of the group. Her brown hair was short and wavy. The clothing she wore was the type of a rogue. It was a mixture of a dull brown, gray, and blue. She was toting a big hammer that looked mechanically augmented. The others seemed to be dressed in rugged civilian clothing. They were all armed with melee weapons or odd looking rifles.

Woro lay on the ground for a few moments, shaking his head to clear the remnants of the vision from his mind. He had never experienced anything like that before. It was almost like when Master Lorhas pushed opponents through the Force, but, how could a vision have done such a thing? He did not like the change Mur Eva underwent in his mind, that was for sure. Uncomfortable, he again made a point to talk to Leus in the very near future. Something was not right with this whole situation. Unfortunately, he was no closer to Mur Eva than he was before the vision. Maybe Feldon or Awne could help. Lorhas and Leus did not want his help at this time. If they felt Mur Eva in their direction, they would have let him know. He turned back up the hallway toward his friends at the "information desk."

Gor 'Ak, who was standing next to the droids, is able to notice the chiss taking an attack posture with hostile intent. The bothan's reflexes were slightly quicker so he could act first. The soldier knew that in an instant shots would be fired.
*Initiative: Gor 24, Awne 20, Kardoon 19, Vorâ€™en 19,Woroken 18, Guards 16, Myra 14. Gor, you are one square away from the reception desk in which Kardoon is using cover. Myra is 5 squares is away from you and so are some of the other complex personnel. The back row of the personnel is 10 squares from you. There are twelve creatures total, 4 armed with rifles and the rest melee weapons. The only cover in the room is the reception desk that Kardoon and his droids are occupying. The lift could be used as cover if you actually got in and shut the door. The right hallway door would also serve as a place to hide but is further away from the personnel.*

Vor'en standing at the back of room sees the beings walkout of one of the rooms. He listens to them telling them to get out or they would be in trouble. *"HA! I have seen scarier things then these guys."* When out of no where the Kardoon yells out and start firing. "Frak!! I quess the time for talk is over Red Team tak'em down." At his orderhe rasies his E-11 and fires on the closest one. He know his people can do there jobs and he would expect nothing less from them.

Few things served to upset GorÂ´Ak Kelto, as he tried to keep his cool as much as possible. But this Chiss certainly qualified for a place on the list. Only trained reflexes allowed him to react upon seeing the Chiss move into a combat position, and in a swift fluid motion, the Bothan had his gun in his hand, flicking the switch to stun and pointing it at the Chiss.
"What are you, insane? I thought you were smart enough to comprehend it the first time, but would you mind trying to do anything but blast everything that gets in our way?"
He knew fully well the other group - the smugglers, he supposed - wouldnÂ´t care about their internal struggles and most likely open fire, but he had acted out of reflex and instinct, not reason. But he cast a quick glance in their direction anyway.
"Just a sec, I had something to ask before we leave"

Awne couldn't believe this was happening again, and what's more, Vor was still giving orders when he was injured! "Vorr you arre in no condition it fight in this and Gorr is the one giving orrderrs herre. Stay back and let us handle this...please."
She moves towards the Chiss, again he was shooting first without thinking and her temper was flaring again, 10 seconds? 10 seconds?!?! oh she'd give them 10 seconds. She hadn't moved that far, just to the Chisses back and stops. She could feel the force building in her as she focuses it, shooting her arms out to the sides when she felt the time was perfect. She hoped Gor would be ok, though, at least she was far enough away from Vor'en.

*Gor's action is readied.*
The farghul padawan observes the chiss raising his weapon at the complex personnel. She then darts toward him with the intention to do harm. The woman then raises her arm and extends the Force out to knock over her targets. A shockwave of Force energy can be felt throughout the room as Kardoon and his droid are pushed flat to the ground. Myra and two humans armed with vibroswords also tumble to the potent Force ability. A rodian armed with a rifle screams out in rodese as a result to the attack. The personnel seemed to have a deadly serious look to their face. *Kardoon takes 14 damage along with his droid.*

The chiss scrambles back up to his feet, eager to participate in the fight that was breaking out quickly. He brings his rifle up to his shoulder briskly and fires at Myra who was flat on the ground from the Force attack. The blaster bolt lands somewhere next to her, having no effect but a burn hole in the ground. Myra flinched at the shot and her face grew with anger.
Myra: "WATCH YOUR FIRE! One stray shot will blow us to HELL!"
The bothan who had his weapon trained on the chiss squeezed the trigger in response to the man not surrendering. Gor squeezed the trigger a little too rough as the stun bolt simply skimmed the chiss harmlessly.

Maybe the time to parry had passed, but Woro was intent on determining that for himself. Instead of drawing his lightsaber, Woro reaches into his kit, and draws out his vox box. "Hello, my name is Woroken," the box said after having the appropriate buttons pushed. After the short phrase is spoken, the wookiee again holds his empty hands in front of him, trying to indicate a peaceful gesture, knowing inside that it probably would not stop the security force from responding to the attack from the Chiss.

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-06-26 01:50:06)

The guard personnel seemed to completely ignore the wookiee's attempt at peace. Myra, who was getting to her feet after the Force attack, barked out orders to the rest of people.
Myra: "Weapons free boys! Snare and stomp! Target the ones with blasters!"
A human male with a rifle fires a medium velocity stun mist at Kardoon. The mist had a net encased in it and the slimy projectile struck Kardoon on the left side of the torso. Kardoon feels a jolt of energy rip through his side and feels his strength sapping fast. He quickly removes the sticking webbing that was on his arm. Luckily, the net did not fully encase his body.
*Kardoon takes 8 damage.*
On the other end of the enemy formation, a human responds to the rifle shot with a shot of his own. This spray mist nails Gor 'Ak center in the chest. He is shocked by a stun blast as the net quickly constricts his body. The bothan finds himself restrained and unable to move.
*Gor takes 8 damage. The enemy beat your opposed grapple and you are pinned. You are unable to act until his next turn.* 
A red skinned twi'lek female lets out a scream and moves up to the line where the human had shot Gor 'Ak. This time it appeared the shot was aimed at the droid positioned to Kardoon's left. The gooey projectile whizzed past the droid and the droid didn't lose composure at all at the near hit.
Awne's eye caught a rodian armed with a rifle running towards her from the left hallway. He broke apart from the mass group of guards and aimed his weapon at her. The quick farghul saw the creature squaring off with her. She immediately hopped to the side as the spray mist went completely off to the right. The mist even zipped past the wookiee harmlessly as it hit the wall behind him.
A big man who was next to Myra charged the reception desk in which the assault team was around. The large human slipped on his way to attack and falls flat on his face embarrassingly. It seemed the floors had been polished too smoothly for his balance.
Twi' lek: "I'll get the snared one!"
The creature rushes along with the others after the rifles had hit their targets. This Twi'lek was armed with a vibroblade and was rushing straight towards Gor 'Ak who had been rendered helpless. The blade swipes at Gor but the bothan is able to duck as the blade hums overhead.
As Gor stands up, he sees another human right in front of him with a sword. Despite his restrained arms, he's able to side step the stab attempt from the zealous human.
Just after the farghul had dodged the spray attack, she sees a human running around the far side of the reception desk. He runs past the chiss' fallen droid and gets right next to Awne. He seemed intent to beat down the padawan with a club. The man was laughing at her with a confident smile.
Three more people who were rushing towards the assault team were stopped by an angry Myra who was laying on the ground. They stopped dead in their tracks with their swords brandished in rage. Myra promptly got up and watched the assault team intently.
Myra: "Standby to withdrawal on my order!"
The three people nodded their head and did not attack the assault team, strangely.
While Awne was looking to her side to the man with the club, she is surprised to see Feldon brush past her. He shot her a very stern glance. The Jedi Knight was standing right next to her, likely to watch her next move. He seemed ready to defend her against the club wielder, and also to keep an eye on his padawan.

The farghul turns to face her attacker that was using a club for a weapon. Awne didn't bother reaching for her lightsaber. Instead, she brought her paw overhead and brought it down in a diagonal strike on the guard's face. The claws sunk into his head fast and deep. She felt his skin rupturing under her claws as she sliced all the way to the other side of his neck. Instantly the man's face was covered with blood and he put his hand to his cut throat in reaction.
Human: "Ugh, I ca....*cough* see."

The rookie to combat brings his rifle jerky and uncontrolled. The chiss taps the trigger in an effort to shoot the eye-patched woman. The bolt whizzed past her and she instinctively crouched lower to the ground. The other three guards behind her also got down. The blaster shot landed just slightly under the pipes near the ceiling. Myra looked back at the wall and then to the chiss.
Myra: "Stop shooting you idiot! If you hit those pipes we'll all be dead!"

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

Sergeant Vor'en decided to watch the fight from the hole carved in the main door. He had his back to the rough jutting metal while he was coping with the pain from his wounds. Feldon had essentially given him a doctor's order to stay out of combat. He had to keep himself unharmed but stay within earshot to help his friends if things did get too rough for them to handle.
As far as Vor'en observed, the enemy was all coming from the left hallway directly towards the front of his unit. Only one person had manage to go around the back of the formation and he had just been struck hard by Awne. He wouldn't have to worry about them getting hit from anywhere unexpected. Possibly the lift, but he would likely notice it in motion. It would be a stand up fight...and it would be vicious. If no one withdrew from this fight they're would be a lot of casualties.
But what did Myra mean about the whole area being blown up? Just what was in this complex that they had sensed Mur Eva in? Vor'en watched the chaos continue as he watched his own back cautiously.

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-06-30 16:05:33)

The wookiee took off moving from the right hallway door in which he had looked for his friends. He had his eyes set on closing in on the group converging near the center console. The padawan could see Feldon and Awne fighting directly in front of him. Woro moved left in relation to their position and swiftly stood next to Gor. The bothan was in bad shape as the sticky net had completely enveloped his torso and arms. The creatures around him were attempting to strike on their helpless opponent. One twi'lek swiped Gor's arm with a vibroblade and the bothan grimaced in pain. He felt a cut open wide and blood was seeping into his fur. *Gor takes 5 damage.*
Once Woroken had stopped next to his friend to engage in the battle, he noticed a human with a rifle moving to intercept him. The wookiee saw the man shoot at him and finish his movement right in his face. The sticky webbing mist flew past Woro as he heard a strange hiss fly by him. Luckily the attacker had missed Woro, though it was close. Two other swordsmen lashed out at the wookiee but they were unsuccessful in their attacks. He had no problems dodging the amateur attacks.
Kardoon observes another rifleman from the formation dart to get in front of the control console. The man aimed his rifle square at the chiss and fired. Kardoon dropped hard behind the desk as he felt the air disruption of the shot. The projectile hip the ground with a splat behind him. The shot landed somewhere next to Awne's foot.
Gor 'Ak struggles with the net, but he was not dexterous enough to have the webbing pop off. This would be dangerous if he did not get it off soon.
The chiss saw that another attacker armed with a rifle got next to the previous one. The enemy was forming a straight line in front of his allies. This one was rodian and he had a malicious glare in his eyes. The green attacker fired from the hit and Kardoon feels the net slap him hard in the chest. The stickiness enveloped him and sent a shock throughout his body. He was unable to move his body parts. *Kardoon takes 6 damage.* Kardoon ordered his droid to return fire and he shot the rodian with his blaster rifle. The rodian was hit in the side of the gut and he screamed in pain.
While Awne was locked in combat, she saw a red twi'lek female stop next to her wounded ally. The twi'lek was armed with a snare rifle. The man was bleeding profusely and it was obvious he couldn't see with all the blood on his face. The club wielder was swinging blindly at the farghul. The expert martial artist saw an opening as the club went down and she erupted with a powerful punch to the stomach. She sank her claws deep into his stomach and the person screamed in pain. The man collapsed face down and was not moving.
Feldon moved to intercept the twi'lek's attack as he ignited his green lightsaber. He brought it around briskly but the blade hummed past the twi'lek's stomach. The twi'lek shot a rifle blast and Feldon got trapped in the sticky webbing. His lightsaber deactivated and he was unable to move. Awne saw this happen to her master and was shocked to see something else. Myra had taken her other allies and was running around the front of her unit. They were obviously coming after her and Feldon. Myra had obviously noticed Awne's skill and wanted to do something about it.

Awne's head snaps to where her master falls "Masterr!" no time to go to him, the others were advancing on her. Her blood was pounding in her ears, adrenaline pumping through her veins. They hurt her master and her pack mates, she was through trying to be good about this, killing the club man had been a semi-accident, she knew her master was disappointed in her, though she didn't know how much and she was trying to do good to show she could do this but now...
She saw red, she was done being nice about this; she had the tools to take care of all of them but...but she had to try one last thing...just one last thing. "Forrgive me forr this Masterr." she mutters to him as her gaze locks on the female pack leader. Her arm extends and her hand makes a snatch at the air as though grabbing the woman from her position, sending the force out to the woman's neck. This was going to end one way or another.

Awne feels the Force flow through her and Myra is levitated off the ground as she grabs her throat.
Myra: "Kgggh!Ca......up!"
The farghul concentrated her abilities and the eye-patched woman is slammed into the ceiling. Once she lowers again, the farghul twists her wrist and Myra's neck made a pop. Myra was dead in mid-air. The farghul promptly released her and she slapped the hard floor. Her hammer fell from her hands and it was obvious their leader was dead.

He pulls out the stock and rasies the weapon looking down the sites. *"Got to make a differeance here or where done for."* He lines up him shot and sqeezes the trigger.

Vor'en sights in on a human with a rifle. The pain was immense in his chest and distracted him from a clear sight picture. The blaster bolt misses his target and it snaps harmlessly into the wall.
The human curses out loud.
Human: "Damn you! You'll blow yourself up!"
The human quickly orients his weapon and fires a stun mist at Vor'en. The mist splats on the door beside him.

Woro again swiped at the guard with the rifle in front of him. He didn't want to kill this guard, but he had every intention of knocking him out, if possible. He drew back a large furry fist and attempted to punch the guard in the face. "I'm coming Gor," he grunted to his friend who was still floundering with the net.

Human:" Aghhhhh!"

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-07-01 02:00:26)

The man Woroken just struck turned to face Sergeant Vor'en who had shot at him. He discharged a spray shot at the veteran and it struck him center mass. Vor'en felt a jolt surge through his body. The webbing dug into his chest, stomach, and arms. The webbing dug into him like Sarlacc tentacles. Vor'en was unable to move.
*Vor'en takes 7 stun damage. Also I didn't see your Grapple check on your sheet.*
Woro watched the attacker as he had effectively stopped the Sergeant. His attention was quickly diverted as the human and twi'lek swordsmen moved to back up the spray shooter. The Jedi apprentice hopped and side stepped the sloppy attacks. After he side stepped, he followed up with a right hook to the twi'lek's jaw. The twi'lek grabbed his mouth with an "Umph". He continued to guard Gor 'Ak. A bigger human who was standing in front of the bothan unleashed with an overhead strike. Gor, despite his body being entangled completely, jumped awkwardly to the side as the axe left a hole in the floor.
The line formation of Woroken, Gor 'Ak, Kardoon, and his two droids seemed to be repelling the complex guard's assault. Kardoon stared down the rodian and human armed with rifles next to his two droids. The rodian attempted to kick Kardoon and Kardoon was brushed by the kick harmlessly. Once Kardoon was slightly off-balanced, the human rushed in with a swinging elbow strike. The chiss managed to duck this attack awkwardly.
Behind this formation, one of the human men who had observed Myra dying dropped his vibroblade and picked up Myra's power hammer. The red-skinned Twi'lek fired a rifle shot at Awne while this was happening. The shot missed completely and Awne rushed forward past her tangled master to knee the female in the gut.
Twi'lek: "Oww! You'll pay for that you furball!"
Awne is quick to notice another human rushing at her. He swings wildly at her with his vibroblade and she dodges yet another attack with the grace of a true martial artist.
Feldon sees his apprentice locked in combat and wriggles free of the sticky webbing. He brought his lightsaber up and activated it.
Feldon: "Keep it up."
*Gor 'Ak is unable to break free of the snare due to failed acrobatics check. You can specify if you'd rather break free by strength or acrobatics. Kardoon and Vor'en are also snared. It is now Awne's turn.*

Performing all kinds of awkward movements to avoid getting hit where it hurt, Gor was quite pleased that he had only suffered a slight scratch so far. He didnÂ´t know how long he could count on that holding true though. He suddenly felt a lot more at ease as he saw WorokenÂ´s familiar form charging towards him, swatting opponents aside. Diving to his side to avoid an axe strike, he called out a greeting to the wookie.
"Thanks big guy, I owe you one. I suppose youÂ´re a bit busy, but do you think you could get this thing off of me?"

"I will masterr, I hope you can forrgive me forr the female..that...wasn't rreally my intention." she frowns slightly but readies herself, claws stretched as she attachs the vibro-wielder.

Vor'en sceams out when the net hit him. He realized in his condition that he had no bussiness in a fire fight but he never did listen to reason. "Son of a Hutt, if I get out of this I am going to cut you and decorate the walls with your inards." There nothing but vemon in the Sargents voice. He starts to feel himself weakening if he takes another jolt like that he is finished. "Firfac! Your dead!! Red Team slot'em I don't want to see a one breathing."

Woro looks over to Gor's side and begins prying at the sticking webbing. He releases all his muscle energy and the gooey substance slides off after much effort from Woroken. The twi'lek guard took this chance to attack Woro but he saw it coming and pulled Gor back a step to dodge the attack. The bothan noticed he had a full range of motion again in moments.

After Woroken completely freed the bothan, he looked towards the enemies who were in front of him and Gor. The snare rifle assailant discharged another blast but the wookiee was so close that the mist flew right over his shoulder without effect. The twi'lek and the other human saw this failed attack. They decided to react by swinging their blades at the padawan. Woro stepped back but felt a minor cut hit his waist from the human. *Woroken takes twelve damage.*
Gor was working with Woro and they seemed to be winning the fight so far. The big human who had slipped over earlier unleashed with a slash at Gor. The blade glazed the side of his stomach. *Gor takes 5 damage.* He felt a sting of pain but was perfectly alright. While Gor stood side by side with Kardoon's droid, he spotted the two riflemen engaging his allies. The two mist blasts went stray of the chiss and his droid. The quick reacting security droid brought his butt stock up of his sporting rifle and struck the rodian right in his odd-shaped mouth. It was obvious the attack had jarred the rodian as his head bobbed awkwardly.
Just behind the defensive line of Wor, Gor, and Kardoon; the two Jedi were locked in melee combat with Myra's personal guard. Feldon spun around to the Twi'lek female's side and cut her in half from the waist up. The snare rifle clattered to the ground and the creature died instantly at the lightsaber attack. A vibroblade user stepped over the Twi'lek's corpse and faced off with the Jedi Knight. Awne saw this while side stepping a fast moving blade.
Gor 'Ak had finally got his weapon up for an attack. However, the blaster bolt he fired glazed past the Twi'lek without hurting him at all. It seemed Gor's ability had been shaken a bit by the snare attack.
While Vor'en was forced to watch the fight from the entrance, he mustered all his strength and wriggled free of the net. The net fell to the ground and he was free to move again.

While the Padawan was fighting, she continually felt her master's feelings. She noticed he shifted from disappointment to commanding respect of her abilities. It was as if Feldon just couldn't get upset with her even if he tried.

Seeing the Bothan clear of the net , Woroken again turns his attention to the attackers. Hoping to incapacitate one of the group, rather than kill, he quickly pulls the stun baton from his belt and swings it at the closest guard to him.
*Atk +15 Stun damage 2d6 +11*

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-07-08 22:28:53)

Woroken takes his stun baton and strikes the twi'lek guard on top of the head. The twi'lek yelps in agony as drool runs down his face. The wookiee's attack had definitely dazed the assailant who back pedaled back into the ranks of his comrades. The twi'lek looked to his friend and they both rushed forward with their swords swinging violently. The padawan easily evaded the swords and calmed his breathing for the continued fight. Woroken observed a rifle user to his left firing at Vor'en. The Sergeant was having trouble with his blaster and didn't even notice the gooey projectile hit the door next to him.
Next to Woroken, Gor Ak' and Kardoon continued to hold the line against their opposition. The large bearded human hopped at the bothan with a forward jab. The tip of the axe cut the right side of Gor's thigh. The bothan felt the sting of the wound keenly. *Gor takes 16 damage.*
Snare rifleman: "Yea, you got em! Watch this!"
Another ruffian armed with his rifle fired a spray shot at Kardoon who was still bogged down by the cumbersome webbing. The shot connects easily and the chiss feels a jolt of numbing energy course through his body. *Kardoon takes 11 damage.*
Snare rifleman: "Yea, we're taking it to them. We'd better get a raise."
The human who had picked up Myra's power hammer earlier rushed the Jedi Knight with malice in his eyes. He wound up the hammer in a circular motion and brought it down in a powerful overhead strike. The hammer struck the floor with a crash, breaking some of the floor's integrity. Feldon promptly bounced off the lowered hammer and brought his emerald lightsaber around in a violent side sweeping arc. The energy blade severed the man's head and he fell close to the other twi'lek who had perished earlier. The hammer hit the ground with a thump as Feldon leaped off it. Once Feldon touched the ground, he let the momentum of the attack carry his blade around to strike the swordsman. The lightsaber went a little off target and struck the side of the man's shoulder.
Human: "Dammit! I'm getting out of here! Don't kill me!"
*There are eight guards left. It is now Gor Ak's turn.*

Vor'en quickly ejects the power pack from his weapon and replaces it with a new one. He stops for a moment and catches his breath. Smiling at what Awne had yelled at him. "You know me darlin, I ain't happy unless I am shooting something or getting shot at." She probably knew this all to well, but she worried about him and he worried about her it was how things where. "Besides why should you have all the fun." He quickly pops up and tries again to being his enemy down Fire ing another burst at him.

Gor, hearing the repeated warnings from the people in the room, decides to attack in a different manner. The bothan lunged forth with a mid-level kick at the twi'lek's gut. The twi'lek swordsman bent over and held his gut with an "omph". The strike had landed soundly in his stomach and Gor was sure that it hurt.

The farghul connects soundly with the human swordsman. Blood began gushing tremendously from his throat and he rotated quickly. After he finished his spin, he fell to the ground awkwardly. Dark ounces of blood were spilling out on the white floor. He would likely die if he didn't receive treatment soon, but he was also out of the fight.

Kardoon's droid, who was standing relatively close to his master, rushed to his aid against the rodian armed with a snare rifle.

He knew, even without the experience and knowledge he had, that the man would die very soon if he wasn't given immediate attention.
Without a word Aymaric quickly goes to the man who is doing his best impression of the Ecczon Faldaz, the bulk freighter that ran into a moon a few years ago and spilled it's highly toxic chemicals all over cute and fuzzy animals.

The rodian shouts out to his comrades who were engaged with the assault team. It was in rodese and it sounded like a command voice. As the rodian was speaking, he backed away cautiously from Kardoon's droid.
The other fighters who were engaged with Gor, Wor, and Kardoon also retreated suddenly. It seems they were headed straight towards the double doors on the left. They appeared to be following the lead of the rodian. Also, the two swordsman next to Awne and Feldon were trying to follow suit. One human disengaged and was darting towards the right doorway. The other guard was stuck between Awne and Feldon's watchful eye. Feldon raised his lightsaber at the guard armed with a sword. The guard looked at his fallen partners and back at the Jedi Knight, he was obviously scared greatly.
Feldon: "Throw down your weapon and you won't get hurt!"

Gor was glad to see that the enemy was retreating. He began to pick away strands of the web still clinging to his clothes, as he heard FeldonÂ´s voice. Turning around, he saw one of the swordfighters trapped between Awne and Feldon. Finally, he saw a chance to get some information. Before holstering his gun, he leaned in towards Woroken and whispered in the WookieÂ´s ear.
"Keep an eye on the Chiss, will you? IÂ´d like to at least get a chance to interrogate this one"
Patting his friends shoulder, he took a few quick steps over towards the trapped fighter, and put on a smile.
"IÂ´d do as he says if I were you. If the lightsaber didnÂ´t tip you off, heÂ´s a Jedi Knight, so heÂ´ll be good for his word. This whole thing was a misunderstanding in the first place, so letÂ´s not make another one, donÂ´t you agree?"

"Can do, Gor," Woro says as the Bothan moves toward the guard. "When this one wakes up, you can talk to him as well," he says with a nod toward the guard who was laying on the floor in front of him still out from the stun baton. Without saying anything, and trying to not attract attention, the wookiee moves to within 10 or so meters of the Chiss, keeping the stun baton out, just in case the itchy trigger finger of the Chiss was not controlled.

Awne takes up a bit of a more relaxed posture now that the enemy was beginning to retreat. That's not to say she didn't keep her claws up in a reminder that she too was still armed and ready to take a swipe at the one between her and Feldon. "Best do as he says." she says softly to the swordsman, glancing back to the medic with the other human with a frown, she hadn't really meant to slash him so deep but...a fight was a fight.

The rough looking human with dark hair reluctantly dropped his sword. The weapon hit the tiled floor with a clank. He raised his arms to the sky and was obviously complying with the bothan.
Human: "Whatever you're doing, you'd better hurry...We're not the only ones you'll have to deal with."
The rest of the group noticed the guards leaving the room from each doorway. The guard who just unarmed himself did not appear happy about being left behind.
Aymaric wasn't paying attention to the withdrawing guards by any means. The human was writhing on the floor and had been cut good across the neck. However, some synthflesh and blood thinner would work to stop the profuse bleeding for now. Aymaric is able to stabilize the man quickly by using his medpac and applying a fresh dressing. Once he was stabilized, the man seemed to calm down a bit but was still in pain.

"Hold still or your flesh will tear, again." Aymaric was slightly irritated that the human on the floor in front of him kept thrashing about. His wound was plugged up but it could easily rip open. "I said hold still! I'll give you something to help if you just sit still!" Reaching into his med kit, Aymaric mixes a dose of heavy painkiller and sedative in an injector. After administering the dose. "There, that ought to help you get through the pain and keep me from getting pissed off."
Finally turning his attention to the group. "I think we should move back to the medical staging area. Vor'en and this guy seriously need to rest, and that area had a narrow corridor leading to it."

I gave you a sedative with the painkiller, should help you sleep." He takes another quick look over the human to make sure there wasn't something medical going on, like excessive internal bleeding. "Hey, can one of you Jedi read this mans thoughts or something? He seems like he wants to tell us something, might be nothing though. Probably grateful to me for saving his life."

Feldon nods to Gor's response with a smile.
Feldon: "Certainly, information is always useful."
The rough looking individual who had been defeated watched with helplessness as his sword was taken away. He paid little attention to Gor as he looked amongst the dead bodies the assault team had created. He stopped over next to Myra who was a few feet away from the computer console. He wiped her eyes shut and looked over to Gor with a snarl.
Human: "Why should I help you? You're the ones intruding upon our property. I'll get out of your way just don't expect anything else from me."
Feldon walked over to Aymaric who was dealing the the enemy casualty. He looked toward the person and back to Aymaric.
Feldon: "This person is in extreme anguish. He doesn't want to tell us anything, though it seems he might not resist if we push at him."
Medically speaking, Aymaric had stopped the bleeding and treated the wound very quickly. He had patched it up by the numbers and even went as far to administer pain medicine. By Aymaric's judgment he could do nothing else via first aid. However, the wounded man would need more sophisticated treatment soon or his condition could get worse.

Aymaric doesn't wait to figure out what the Wookie said. "Push him, are you crazy?" Aymaric looks at Feldon with a small amount of disgust obvious on his face. "This man needs medical attention, not abuse! And since we are speaking of people who could die in the next few hours. Sergeant Vor'en, you will cease to be a part of this rescue mission and get some needed rest willingly or I will MAKE you rest!" Mimicing the Jedi's fighting style, Aymaric brandishes his medication injector menacingly at the very wounded Seargeant. "Don't try to test me either."
Turning his attention to the disarmed Swordsman. Pointing a finger which is backed up by a very stern look."You need to make a quick decision. Your buddy here will die very soon if he doesn't get some serious help. I can provide that help, but I can't do it if I am being shot at. So if you know anything and can help us finish our task so we can leave, it would help everyone greatly."
"Someone help me move him back to the rally point." The very irritated and very bloody medic begins to pick up his gear and prepares to move the wounded man.

After the young human medic's outburst, everyone was stunned into silence for a moment. Impressed, the wookiee nods his head, quite impressed, at Aymeric. He stows his baton, and walks over to assist the fiery medic's moving of the wounded guard. He appreciated the medic's determination, and he made good sense.

More fun that way and let her mind run off for a while, usually to home which allowed her a few minutes to gather herself, something she had been meaning to do.
Take long deep breathes the farghul wills her mind to calm, her heart beat to slow to normal and herself to feel a sense of peace, at least in the images of her forest she felt relaxed and calm and everything her master had been trying to push through her thick skull.
And then the sensor pack beeped and everything shattered, her mind sped up to what could possibly be approaching. Enough fighting had been done and she wasn't about to let more happen. Without a word to the others she moves just slightly past her master, enough that if she used any form of force she could hope it would do little damage to him at least.
She had disappointed him enough for one day, she promised herself she wouldn't pick up her lightsaber unless it was life or death, always another way; something she remembered from training, there's always another way. Right. So whatever was coming was going to see the kinder, gentler side of her force if it meant harm.
The Farghul takes a shoulder-length stance, elbows slightly bent with her hand relaxed but ready, her tail was off the floor and curved slightly, the few of the original Red Team would remember the posture from her days with her vibrodagger and hand-to-hand skills. She still remembered, always would, and she would put it to use. At least her father had taught her to disarm without hurting -too- much.

Nodding again at Woroken. "Thanks for the help. Hopefully we won't need to do this for anyone else." Aymaric pulls his pack off again and sets up his equipment for surgery. Looking the human in the eye. "I'm going to give you a heavier dose of pain meds and another sedative. You just try to relax, okay?" The Falsoor medic has a thought, one that might help him with this delicate surgery. "Hey Woro, can you help me with this? I know you have a good amount of skill with healing and I could sure use another set of knowledable hands."

The wookiee nods at the requet of the human. He watches Aymeric work and does his best to help with the complex surgery as much as possible. He took the sedative from the surgeon and administered same to the guard. For someone so young, the human was very skilled and confident in his abilities. "Awne, yell if you need me, we need a few moments back here," Woro yells to his Farghul friend, as he wants to be sure to alert the rest of the team they would be indisposed for a bit.

Vor'en listens to all of them freat over his condition. He would argue with the Arymaic that he was fine and he would stay in a command compassity only. But with Awne she knew better, she knew that he was in bad shape and needed to be in a hospital not in the field. "Kid I have been in wars older then you so don't worry about me.I will stay in a support role Doc." He hears the scanner go off. He pulls out his datapad. "You know I am eally starting to hate this thing. Ok people we have something coming this way. Gor is in command of mission. Master Lorhas is also still in command.

Aymaric and Woroken carry the wounded guard out the humongous door that the Jedi had cut through earlier. The two quickly hear the noisy chaos of the facility fade away as their feet move across rocky ground. They proceeded steadily through the rock tunnel and arrived back at the lift. This was their designated casualty collection point. The mercenary Squirts and Qwy were holding security on the lift with small talk being their only weapon against boredom. Their eyes quickly lit up as they saw the wounded man and they reinvented their security postures.
Squirts: "Man, you guys ran into something in there....I want a piece of the action."
Woro and Aymaric quickly set the human down on the clearest spot in the rocks. Aymaric knew this operation would be risky but it should be fine with the clear lighting and the fact the man was already stabilized. He wouldn't have to worry about the person feeling pain and moving uncontrollably. Woroken passed a injector from the medical pack and Aymaric injected the person. He went unconscious and the medic instantly went to work by peeling off the bandage. The man had a vein that was spilling blood in his throat and it needed to be clamped.
Woroken held a glow lamp from the medical bag and pointed the light at the open wound on the throat. Aymaric reached into the bloody mess and pulled out a vein with his pincers. Dark blood gushed on the Wookiee and Aymaric. The true medical personnel weren't phased and Aymaric closed the end of the vein promptly. It would take him a few more minutes to put everything back in working order though.
Back in the reception room of the facility, Gor continued to converse with the swordsman.
Swordsman: "Well, I'm willing to bet its the REAL security force of this installation. As far as turning them around, I'm afraid I don't have that kind of pull here. You'll have to understand I'm just a lackey for hire. I could try but these droids are programmed to strict protocols."
While Gor 'Ak was listening, his comlink began to chirp. He was getting an incoming transmission.
Vor'en was occupied with his sensor pack. It seemed there was one life form in the room moving about cautiously. Not to mention the other life forms that were scattered about the facility. But the immediate point of interest was the life form in the room that was moving that wasn't the assault team. Vor'en followed the lead and it seemed it was coming from a vent next to the pipes along the wall. If he had a boost he could see into the vent.
*I moved Aymaric and Woroken to the exterior CCP. They are still within the ten minute window of surgery so they are unable to act in tandem with the group right now.*

Or this thing is broken which ever I am going to have a look." He puts away his data pad and pulls out a glow rod shinning it into the vent.

Inside the vent with the help of the glow-stick, the human soldier would clearly be able to see a wall of fur with two brown tiny eyes, and a cloth hood. Immediately the creature ghasps in shock but loks closely towards the glowing light as it says softly with amazement "Ee chee wa maa." Then, noticeing that there was now a way out, it makes a mad scramble for the exit and falls out, does a somersault with yet another exclamation "Yub nub!" The creature is an Ewok with red fur and stands about one meter tall. The Ewok readies his vibrodagger but doesnt attack as it's gaze changes from one individual to the next...over and over.

Vor'en steps back as the Ewok falls out of the vent and on to the floor. "Great just what we need Woro's little bother." As the little furry whatever pulls out a vibro dagger and waves it around trying to defend it's self. "You have got to be kidding me. I am not even going to waste a blaster bolt on you." Vor'en moves away back to the doorway where he was standing before. Putting away his blaster and deactiveating his glow rod. He finds a place on the floor to set and rest for a bit. He pulls out a ration pack and eats something. "Woro I think we found you a new friend to play with. Or I can let Awne take care of him whatever works."
Vor'en continues to eat the ration and drink some water until the squad is ready to move.

But still, she couldn't help herself when it just came out "awwww he's so cute!" Her tail waves as for just a moment she forgets completely they were in a battle zone.
Forgoing her post she moves to the little creature "Hello....It's ok, we'rre all frriends herre." She holds out a furred paw to the little creature hoping it would take kindly to her.

The ewok jumps back a bit, startled and points his vibro dagger at the farghul. His mind then finds the meaning of the word..."friend" was it? Hmm...He walks slowly towards her and looks at her hand then to her. "Jeerota?" A thought suddenly comes to him and he points to Vor'en but still looks to Awne "Chiotto goo?" If she was a friend, she would give him an offering of some kind. Still, to be polite he pats her paw and says "Luu."

Watching as he points to the old soldier she hums softly "Vorr'en? he's a frriend..grrumpy, but a frriend." She tilts her head, she didn't know what he wanted really, was it about Vor'en he was trying to convey or was it something he wanted from the soldier.

The Ewok tilts his head as he tries to place the language she was using...It seemed familiar yet he could not place it just yet. He could understand her somewhat...just not sure about how to answer outside of his own language. To make it less confusing than things already were for the poor farghul, he points again to Vor'en and holds out a digit, and makes his paw seem to radiate from it all around. Hopefull she would know he meant light. "Chiotto goo?" He repeats.

Awne could feel that her master was cherishing the farghul's wonder at the ewok. But, she could also detect the Jedi's growing apprehension at the danger level. It was amazing how the last 20 hours and a ship's journey had brought their attunement this close. Perhaps it was the adversity they had faced and the mutual dependability that was causing this? It was true that Feldon's views toward his padawan were being tossed back and forth. Awne had proven to be the metaphoric pendulum. Her feelings and actions have swung in both directions since the journey began.

As he walked back through the remains of the door, he first saw Awne excitedly talking to a small ball of fur. By description, he had heard of Ewoks but had never seen one in person before. It would be interesting to try and communicate with it.
He also noticed Feldon and Gor conversing to the other guard that had thrown down his weapon. He walked up to the group just as the guard turned to leave. "Everything okay?" he asked his friends.

Kaz'jee looks up at the wookie and tilts his head as he hums in thought. He hands up a paw as well to the larger fuzzy being and starts to try and see if he knew the language that he was speaking. He had it narrowed down and says with politeness and nervousness "Wyaaaaaa. Ruh ruh." His voice was certainly much higher than the wookies, so it might have been a bit harder to understand coming from the Ewok....But he hoped that the message got through at least somewhat.

The Ewok looks up to the Wookie and listens very carefully to the words that are asked of him. He then proceeds to answer, in Shiirywook, that he had only been in the vent because he was hiding from his kidnappers...and that his home was on the forest moon of Endor. "I not sure where friend might be...Never met friend of you." He grows less nervous but still stays near Awne as he looks to around only to end up back at the Wookie "Help find you friend...help me go back?"

"Hey thanks Squirts. I have had a bit of schooling and when you have friends who like to play freefall man, (see the OOC thread for an explanation) you get a lot of experience looking at the inside of bodies." A small tired smile creases Aymaric's face. "I'm going to go meet up with the others and see what the plan is. They'll probably need me to plug more holes by the end of the day or at least bandage a few boo-boos." The smile that creases his face this time doesn't have any tiredness. "I kill me!"
While moving down to the others, Aymaric the miracle worker, a title he has recently given himself, finishes cleaning off as much blood from his armor as he can. His eyes quickly focus on the new addition to the group, and faster than the spped of immaturity, his brain goes into smart-ass mode." That's not fair! You get light things that kill in a single swipe, mind powers that can make a Rancor pee itself, AND you can make little versions of yourself appear outta nowhere! Really you guys, you've got to show me how to do that!" Aymaric's teeth and gums make a grand appearance in the biggest smile Aymaric has ever shown. When his smile subsides a little. "No really, how did you guys find an Ewok in here? Is this a petting zoo or something? HA HA HA!" bent over with laughter, he barely gets out. "A petting zoo...with Homicidal..Ewoks!"

Awne nods her head to the Ewok "yes, all the morre help we can get the betterr I think with the way things arre going lately." Though her thoughts are then derailed by the appearance of the medic. His...strange joke has her brow raised and tail furled into that little question mark that came up when she was confused.
"Petting Zoo?" she had never been to anything called a zoo and thus the idea confused her as she looked from the wookiee to the human "what's a zoo and why would one wish to pet it? is it soft orr some such?"

Kaz'jee had completely disregarded the person's remarks and jokes about petting zoo's, for he too had never seen one let alone hear of them. The Ewok pauses before shaking its head at the Wookie in response to his first question. The next question though, he pauses once more before saying quietly "Hid me on my own...Men in white captured Kaz'jee from village...brought him here...Then me escape and hide." He shows the vibrodagger with a seemingly happy sound "But not before borrowing."

Aymaric wasn't really surprised no one had heard of a petting zo. He had only seen or heard of them on Coruscant, where there was no more natural habitat for wild animals. "Hmmm..guess I'll have to educate all of you later." Looking around at his companions and the recently added plush toy of doom, Aymaric spots the unconcious Twilek on the floor. "Suppose I should do something about that since no one else seems to want to." Pulling the mesh tape out of his utility belt, the medic uses his agile surgical skills to expertly bind the wrist and ankles of the unconcious one. WHile doing this he makes a comment to Vor'en. "Good to see your doing well Vor. I hope my earlier statements won't cause any hard feelings between us."
When finished with binding up the Twilek, Aymaric stands up and says: "So what's the plan? Are we gonna finish storming this place or what?"

Feldon: "Where did you receive your training Aymaric? You seem to be very good at what you do. You're alert, aware, and versed in your skill of medicine. Indeed, us Jedi often become too dependent on our luminous abilities rather than our physical capabilities. "
The Jedi Knight spoke while keeping his eyes on Woroken. The wookiee knew this was one of his observations that he had seen before. Feldon was likely trying to teach the apprentice something.

Woroken furrowed his brow a bit, as he considered the statement Master Feldon had made. Feldon was always more obtuse in his manner of teaching than his own Master was. Nothing was ever black and quite according to Feldon--there were lots of shades of gray. The wookiee knew Feldon had some questions about the other Jedi (Leus), and this lesson could be an allusion to him. Of course, Woro might be overcomplicating things, as he sometimes did, and Feldon was simply instructing him. As he usually did, when he wasn't sure about Feldon's message, he simply agreed. "Very true, Master," the wookiee said, nodding his head in agreement. "We Jedi definitely need to strive for balance in all things."
He turned to Gor who was close by, and offered a suggestion. "How do you feel about heading into the other set of double doors? I suspect with the commotion Lorhas and Leus have been making, we might still have a bit of surprise on our side?"

As Gor listened to Feldon praise Aymaric, he couldnÂ´t help but feel a more accurate interpretation form in his head.
*You mean that sometimes we get too blinded by our self-perceived superiority that we forget that the Force donÂ´t magically solve all our problems*
He hoped the Jedi wasnÂ´t reading his mind now, but if he was, it was not an opinion that he was ashamed of. As Woroken turned to him, he nodded, replacing his gun in its holster.

Well, another good thing you learned as a bounty hunter was adaptability. If this was the way things needed to be run, then fine. But he hoped the Republic would not try award him with some promotion when they got out of here. HeÂ´d prefer cash.
Looking over the small squad, he gave a small nod towards Woroken.
"All right then, through the doors it is. If the two furry people with glowsticks would be so kind as to stand in the front with me, IÂ´ll take the lead. Aymaric, Squirts, stay with VorÂ´en and keep your eyes and ears open. I hope you can keep our backs safe on your own, Feldon?"
He looked around to see if there were any objections, and noticed the small ewok, and shone a smile.

Still smiling, Gor pulled his Ion Blaster from its holster. Their brief prisoner had hinted that the defense force of this facility consisted of droids, so it should come well in hand. Also, there appeared to be a certain amount of volatile construction details down here, given Myra´s concern about blaster fire. Ion blasts should not provide any certain danger though.

Gor'ak's warning about Ion weapons and blaster fire, reminds Aymaric of the comm chatter during the fight with the security team a short time ago. It was common knowledge that droids reacted poorly to electrical fields and Ion. Maybe these weapons would be beneficial against the droids they might encounter. Picking one up and showing it to Gor. "Hey Gor, you think these might be somthin' worth using against the droids or any others we might come across?" While talking to Gor, Aymaric examines the rifle, looking for safeties hand holds and triggers, then he shoulders it. " They seem pretty simple to use." Aiming at the body of the decapitated reception droid. "Might sell for a decent price somewhere, huh?" Aymaric fires the rifle from where he picked it up, he was hoping for some kind of indication that the electrical net rounds could harm droids. He wasn't really certain what he should be looking for though.

"Good idea. But I prefer to rely on things I know work"
Gor patted the Ion blaster in his hand, and smiled.
"Still, it couldn´t hurt to bring them along"
Walking over to one of the fallen guards, Gor picked up one of the strange rifles. If he wasn´t mistaken, these weapons were Stokhli spray sticks. They were rare, long range stun weapons, designed for big game hunting. As it happened, they had been frequently used by the Noghri death commandos under the command of Darth Vader. It made him wonder how they had ended up in the hands up those people. Still though, Vader had had a stronghold here on Vjun, so perhaps they were just remnants.
When the squad had finished adjusting their gear, he proceeded forward, towards the doors Woroken had indicated.
((OK, I´m not sure if Gor would actually know all that stuff, but I figured he could pass the Knowledge checks, perhaps would have heard of it in his field of work, and I can´t see anything wrong with him knowing it))

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-08-04 15:46:19)

Gor and Aymaric take time to assess the capabilities of the enemy weapons. Gor noticed that the weapon make and model was a Merr-Sonn Munitions GRS-1. It worked in a similar manner to a stokhli spray stick but was shaped like a rifle. This made it easier to handle than the stick. It also provided for a large capacity *(90 shots)*. Aymaric test fired the weapon and the thump of the rifle firing caused everyone to become alert. Alas, he wasn't able to determine it's effectiveness on droids. But there was no doubt it could hinder a droid just as it could a creature.
Gor also figures that the Ion Blaster might not trigger any disasters with the complex, but the energy and force of the blast may cause problems. It had less piercing power but a stray shot that hit the right area might have the same effect as a blaster bolt. It was up to him if he wanted to take that risk.
*Which direction are you moving the group? The left hallway, right hallway, back outside, or the lift that the cargo droid went down? Also, Gor might not know the information about Darth Vader's stronghold unless he made a successful knowledge lore check.A lot of people who were against the Empire didn't even know about this. This is also true with the Noghri commandos. If you're taking a snare rifle the stats are as follows: GRS-1 Snare Rifle 3d8 Stun Damage, webbing (Net qualities), Inaccurate (No fire at long range). After 90 shots the canister must be replaced. Availability: Restricted. Weight: 2 Kg. It is considered a rifle.*

He was starting to look nervous but still was trying to maintain a brave outlook on things, his vibrodagger ever ready.

Awne looks down as a tugging to her tail snapped her attention from the revere it had moved to. A faint smile tugs at her lips at the Ewok, he really was adorable, so much smaller than herself. *I wonder how old he is..* she wonders, a cub or older? if he here and was wielding a weapon then surely he was older, but then had he simply been taken as a cub?
She shakes her head to stop the thoughts from running around, she needed to focus, danger was everywhere now it seemed; and indeed they needed to move quickly else more people come after them and endanger the pack. The offered hand is accepted into her own "yes, we do need to go, stay behind Worro and I alrright? being in the frront isn't the best thing forr one that we know not the fighting prrowess but it's alrright, we'll prrotect you." She grins brightly and looks to the wookiee, poking his arm with her free hand and chuckling.
It was strange, she was feeling more like herself, at least more in control of herself. Perhaps fighting with her hands again, trying to do her best, again trying to please her master was doing her some good, and now the addition of the Ewok, so small...just as small as Ha-*No…don't think there…not ready for those thoughts.* she shakes her head again, reigning in the wash of sadness that threatened to spill out. She was doing so well, best not to spoil it by going back to those thoughts.

"That was so cool!" Standing in the same spot he had fired the net rifle from, Aymaric looks at the rifle in amazement, and sadness. "This would have been a good tool to have when we were fighting those crazed people, topside." He continues to look the weapon over, trying to become a little more familiar with it. "If no one else is going to grab one up, then Ima gonna grab all the extra ammo canisters." Aymaric tries to sling his new rifle over his shoulder but is reminded of his other rifle when the two of them become entangled. *"Crap, I might have to leave this monster behind, not too good with it anyway."*
Aymaric jogs back to the medical rally point where Squirts and Qwy were watching over the wounded human. "Hey Qwy, here. This rifle used to belong to a Feeorin named Theos, who loaned it to me after he died." The joke was horrible and Aymaric knew it. His usually broad smile never quite made it to his face. Instead, the smile was replaced by a look of confusion and shame. The glint in his eye quickly extinguished while his brow furrowed and his body tensed as if someone had slapped him in the head. *What is WRONG with me!* Without another word he quickly leaves the rally point and heads back to the group waiting in the reception area. *I really, really hope no one else heard that.*
Checking his comm switch to make sure it had been off, Aymaric arrives at the reception area and begins to remove any remaining canisters from the dead guards. "Give me a sec to gather these up."

Aymaric scrounges the ammunition off the twisted and dead corpses. He was able to collect 8 canisters for his new weapon. With a little luck, he wouldn't have to use them all on this planet and he could keep a nice surplus. Squirts looked particularly calm yet annoyed and he continued to sit watch on the CCP. Someone would wonder why that merc came all the way out here. What was his real name? The nick name Squirts didn't really seem becoming of a mercenary type.
Feldon got in the back of the formation as the group prepared to make entry into the next hallway. He realized they were concerned about the Chiss and the Jedi Knight posed a question to the man.
Feldon: "Hey, do you think you could wait outside at the casualty point until we're finished? I think it would be better for all parties involved. It's nothing against you."
Kardoon acknowledges this and puts up no fight to go on guard duty.
The hallway doors are opened with a whoosh, and the military units promptly stride into the area. The long hallway was empty. The room was brightly lit and covered in a brilliant white like the rest of the facility. It had this sterile essence to the whole complex that made you think it was quite sophisticated for a mining guild. The tiled floor was smooth and reflected the lights back into your eyes like a sunny day in Hoth. For some reason this place was kept remarkably clean. And the rest of you notice pipes running along the corner of the ceiling as well. There were doors parallel to each other as they extended the length of the hallway. There was also a door at the end of hall that was flushed and centered to the other doors. There were a total of ten doors and it was anyone's guess as to where they should start looking. Feldon calls out to the others.

His thoughts raced on in his mind about what would happen if they were attacked. He thought about just what kind of metal it was...and what it would want. He quickly honed in on the thoughts about what to do in regards to attack style and such. He would need to be ready if he wanted to prove himself valuable.

"Roger that. LetÂ´s regroup at the lift, and see what weÂ´ve found"
While talking, Gor heard AwneÂ´s warning, and he was also painfully aware of the accuracy of it. He motioned the squad back the way they had come, with swift motions.
"Pull back team, weÂ´ll regroup with the others at the lift. Apparently they have made some discovery that we should look at"
As they pulled back, Gor decided to hang back behind at the bend of the hallway they had entered before, just before entering the hallway with many doors. As he moved he kept his blaster ready, but also extracted his holorecorder from his belt. This could be worth getting a shot at.
((Stealth +22 if I manage to get around the corner before whatever it is comes through the doors. Initiative +12 if we need to fight.

Gor went just around the corner and noticed that the only place to hide would be the doorway. It would stay open if he stood next to it and likely tip something off that they were there. He didn't bother with his holorecorder and listened to the message on his comlink.

You are to rescue her if she is held captive anywhere. You are to assist to get her out of danger, if any.
2. Conduct a reconnaissance patrol on the surface of Vjun to determine any Falsoor presence. You are also to determine if there is any other force that could be a threat to galactic security or the Republic. If Falsoor is discovered, you are to find out what they are doing there and why. Your secondary objective will be to gather any information of Falsoor's corruption. You must take evidence of Falsoor personnel handling illegal weaponry. Also, take evidence of any other corrupted item,data, or person. If at any point during the mission you feel you cannot accomplish the objectives, arrange for extraction.*

The group moves quietly through the front door. Awne ends up being the last one through the door and she hears a voice behind her. The farghul could almost feel her skin burn at the feeling of being spotted.
Droid: "Stop right there trespasser!"
The doors close shut as she feels something whiz past her and slap the wall. They had just been spotted but the double doors was the only thing between them and their enemy. Action would have be to taken quickly.

Following Gor'ak's orders, like a good little trooper, Aymaric quickly takes up a defensive position behind the reception desk. He orients himself so the desk is between him and the door the group just came out of. While moving debris out of his way, mostly droid bits, Aymaric remembers that no one has tried to hack the console since the groups initial entry into the reception area. "Hey Gor, did you ever get a chance to look at this computer? Maybe it can help us out a bit. Of course it will have to wait until we deal with whatever is coming through that door."

As the doors slammed shut behind them, and he had heard a droid call out, Gor shook his head in frustration, both at his ever-increasing dislike for this hellhole of a planet, and also for the obnoxious Jedi in the other end of the comlink. This was why he never liked being in charge of anyone. Because it always turned out do that people would tell him to lead them, and then quarrel with everything he told them to do. And it didnÂ´t help that he was developing a particular dislike of the Jedi in question either.
It didnÂ´t matter though, as he knew that time would be of the essence now. As he was right by the doors, he leveled his blaster in a head height. Whatever kind of droid came through that door would get its circuits fried faster than even its processor brain could react.
In the background he heard Aymaric say something, even though he was only half listening.
"Yeah IÂ´ll look into it. But right now IÂ´m a bit pissed, so lets just blast whatever comes through that door, okay? Or just to formalize, if you donÂ´t recognize it, make sure it canÂ´t walk back through that door"

*Seal the door! Of course!* Aymaric didn't ask for permission or wait for the logical side of his brain to catch up. Instead, he immediately takes aim at the center of the two doors and starts firing off electrically charged nets. As he pulls the trigger for his second net shot, he says out loud what he's trying to do. "Maybe this will slow them down!" BWOOSH! goes his second shot. "Or maybe short out the door controls a little!"

Woro ducked to the side, to improve Aymeric's shot at hitting the doors. "Get'em kid," he thought as he instinctively got out of the way.
He pulled his saber, knowing that if the droids made it through the door, he would have to be prepared to take them out.

Kaz'jee had been almost terrified to the point of crying as he clung to Awne, when suddenly it was almost as if something had snapped inside the Ewok. He looks up to Awne with a strong determination and moves in fron of her, pushing her back and taking a fighting stance...his Vibrodagger ready. If any of the things came their way...he would attempt to swing his blade directly at the first droid's mid-section. "Awne safe with Kaz'jee...protect Awne!"

Awne curses under her breath as she was spotted, her tail snapping up just as the doors close behind her. Too close for comfort in nearly loosing her tail, she shakes her head and looks to the others, droids were always trouble; always. A yelp escapes her as she finds herself behind the Ewok...a fairly suisidal Ewok if he thought he was going to stand up against droids like this. She shakes her head and grabs the Ewoks hand, tugging on him "Come! this is no place to stand grround, we need coverr." she looks behind her towards the reception desk and nods "Therre, good coverr. Fight when something comes close not out in the open wherre you can be shot."

Aymaric emptied his whole canister on the double doors. The webbing that had stuck to the seams of the door quickly solidified. Aymaric also shot around the seams for good measure. After he was done firing the room grew silent and the group looked at each other with anticipation. Metallic footfalls could be heard in the outside hall as the droids were gathering at the door.
The doors moved barely an inch and stopped. The door shut and attempted to open again. The gears of the door could be heard whirring as they were not successful. A voice could be heard from the other side.
Droid: "This door needs maintenance."
Droid 2: "Roger, Roger."
Aymaric had devised a successful plan to keep the enemy at bay, for now.

Feldon: "This is Gor's choice as to what we do....hey...are you feeling ok?"

Awne's eyes glaze over slightly as the feeling nearly overwhelmed her completely. She was sure her master was talking but it was so faint to her ears she couldn't be sure what he was saying.
She had stood without realizing it, moving slowly towards the direction that would take her back outside, this pull...had she ever felt something so strong before? What was it? She needed to find it, needed to go look outside and follow what the force was bidding her to see.

He was about to walk after her, but then looked back to te rest fo the group. Why was she walking away from them...and why did her mood seem to change? He thinks as hard as he could before he grew fed up with it and sat down, making an upset/angry noise.

Woroken concentrated but he could sense nothing in the Force. The wookiee was able to determine there was a possibility there was something misleading the farghul though. It was as if there were some kind of echo he was chasing but could not hear.
The ewok saw that he would need a boost to get into the ventilation area, as would the others if they wanted to infiltrate the ducts. Feldon didn't seem to pay any attention to what the ewok as he had his eyes on Awne.
Feldon watched his apprentice in wonder. His head traced her all the way back to the entryway the Jedi had created.
Feldon: "Hey why are you going that way?"
The farghul apprentice stepped through the hole the Jedi had carved and back into the rocky area that had housed the turrets. Only this time, the atmosphere was drastically different. Her feet sloshed in a pool of blood that filled the whole room all the way through the tunnel to where the lift was. Mangled and charred corpses were strewn about and limbs were just breaking the surface of the blood sea; as if they were outreaching for their own life. In the center of this nightmarish sight, sat a woman that wore a cloak. Her features were hidden to the fargul. She seemed to be sobbing and adjusting her body slowly.

Finally something seems to give her pause as she comes to a stop feet from the figure, her head tilts to the side as she blinks slowly and takes in each minute detail.

Mur Eva notices the farghul grab her lightsaber and a look of anger grows on her face. The Jedi Knight shifted her stance to position her lightsaber in a basic and two-handed stance. Awne remembered her intense sparring sessions with her back on Yavin 4. Jes typically favored the Form IV stance which was aggressive and acrobatic. This was not like her. Before the farghul had a chance to fully grasp the situation, the Jedi lunged at Awne with her lightsaber swinging at her chest.

Vor'en looks at the blips on his digital read out of the complex. He didn't have a map of the facility so everything was blurry with the dots representing life forms on the display. There seemed to be many life forms around him. Some where friendly, and some he did not know about. There were life forms near the lift and some in the turret area. One thing was for certain, his unit was not alone in this underground facility.
Woroken and Kaz went outside to see Awne. She was holding her lightsaber up in an attack stance. Strangely though, there were no targets in sight. The two heard her say, "Mur, snap out of it!"
However, Mur Eva was nowhere in sight. Nor could the wookiee detect her presence in the immediate area.
The farghul saw the wookiee and the ewok, then suddenly the nightmarish scene disappeared. The rocky passageway was as normal as when she had first saw it. This whole display to the wookiee seemed like another one of Awne's bizarre outbursts, this could stir up some alarm. After all, she had attacked the group back on the *Starshade*.

Awne looks over to the other two that had entered, intent to move in front of them to block them from her once female companion but turning finds...nothing. The farghul looks back to the wookiee and ewok in distress before looking back to see nothing.
Her hand drops to her side, the lightsaber extinguishing as she falls to her knees looking to the floor "I..but I saw herr....she was...she was..." her voice had begun to grow softer and softer as she mumbled she had seen her, how had that happened? she was right there!

He purposely was waiting for a response before telling Awne everything about what he had felt earlier--that the Farghul might have been confused by something.

He knew that he had to talk to the Masters about this.

Settling down at the computer again, Gor heard the sounds coming from the double doors. It didn´t sound like they were going to get in this very moment, but he put his Ion pistol on the desk next to him, so it would be easy to reach.

Most of Aymaric's attention, in the last few moments, had been spent concentrating on what Gor'ak was doing, and trying to figure out a way to help. The Bothans statement about needing a code cylinder and a voiceprint, reminded him of some of the mechanics classes he took in college, and that pieces of the receptionist droid were still laying around the room he was in. "Hey Gor, maybe the remaining droid parts will have what we need to get that computer running for us!" Aymaric the miracle worker quickly moves about the room looking for the droids head and the body parts that weren't completely destroyed. His hope is that the droid had a code cylinder somewhere on it's body and it's vocabulator was still intact.
The first pang on the door startled Aymaric at first, but he kept up his search, more vigorously now. The noise and the subsequent fear that it caused in the youngish man, made him run through a list in his head of all the people who should be here to help him not die when the droids broke through the door. Yelling at the top of his lungs. "Squirts, Qwy! Get down here would ya?! I think we're going to need your help soon!"

The experienced fighter resumed his defensive posture as Aymaric scavenged through the wrecked droid parts. Aymaric could not see the vocabulator, but he knew it was there. The actual removal of the part could take up to an hour to complete though. He grabbed the droid's head and the torso, ready to go to work.
Feldon walked over to the ventilation duct and pushed his back up against the wall. The Jedi was offering his knee for someone to climb to the shaft.

Kaz could not see particularly well in the dark ventilation ducts. However, his keen sense of direction could definitely lead the group back the way he had come. This vent went straight for about 28 meters then split into a T-junction at the end. Taking a right at the end of the passage would lead back to the room he was imprisoned in. That was the place where research had been conducted upon him. His sense of direction also led him to believe that taking a left would probably bring them somewhere in the vicinity overhead of the security droids.

Feldon: "Hold on now. Kaz can scout the vents a bit before we move out. I don't want our leadership to lose total control of the team. They are still in charge and we must wait for orders."
Awne could sense that her master was completely patient despite some of the others readiness to move. He was definitely like a wall of stone when it came to keeping his patience, it would not crumble except under extreme circumstances. The farghul might wonder if his strict adherence to Jedi code would become a hindrance one day. The Jedi Knight looks to Vor'en.
Feldon: "No Sergeant, my hands are full investigating this vent and dealing with our enthusiastic team mates. What did they say?"
The veteran soldier heard a reply from his helmet comm.

Lorhas: "Give us a second Red 7, we'll be right at your position with the equipment. Out."

Next to the reception desk, it seemed a scene was unfolding with the medic and the mercenary.
Squirts: "Look man...every comic relief character I ever fought next to got killed. The fact that you can patch us up makes you an even bigger target. Why don't you just go stand next to that little Ewok and let the both of you get burnt to a crisp. I don't want nothing do with you."
The man gave Aymaric a forceful shove and a long stare down. However, the man's attention is caught by the Twi'lek who was now conscious and staring at the ceiling.

"Comic relief..." The words had stung Aymaric's pride much more than the shove and the threatening staredown. His earlier thought of foot to groin combat maneuvers (AKA: FtGCM) finally caught up with Aymaric's thought center. In a matter of nanoseconds the thought center decided that the FtGCM was better than the crap pants and suck thumb defensive manuever it was about to initiate (AKA: CPaSTDM), and immediately enacted the FtGCM protocol. Having Squirts look away helped the kids confidence considerably. "...I'm the karking headliner!"
His aim was tru and powerful. He could see the Merc grunting as he went down hard, fountains of blood spraying from his pants. At least, that's what he wanted to see.

Aymaric delivers a powerful kick to the mercenary's groin. The medic had caught Squirts completely off guard as his foot connected square to the target.
Squirts: "Omph! Uhhhhh..."
Everyone in the reception room saw the disruptive situation quickly get worse as the merc fell to the ground in a heap. Aymaric had bested the man in one move. Squirts laid on the ground very still and was moaning in agony.
Squirts: "You....bastard...owwww. Cheap shot...."
Just as this had caught everyone's eye, Lues Van and Kel-Yun Lorhas came through the double doors opposite the entrance that had been sealed. Lues was pushing forward a repulsor crate that was full of weaponry.
Lorhas: "Greetings....this is what we've found. Now, I have a question for you Sergeant that you haven't answered."

Woro watched as the situation devolved, unfortunately a common occurence for the former Red team. If he wasn't so surprised he might have chuckled at the young medic kicking the veteran guard. As hectic as the wookiee sometimes got during combat, he was nothing compared to Aymaric. "At least he can heal," Woro thought to himself. Before he had an opportunity to break up the activities, Lorhas and Leus returned. Lorhas had a calming influence on everyone, as everyone in the team respected him immensly, a trait helpful right now.

GorÂ´s first reaction to seeing Aymaric kick Squirts in the groin was a chuckle, but then he got more serious.
"Hey, save it for the enemy. Either keep watch on that door, or grab a weapon and then watch it. And Aymaric...while IÂ´m not above playing it dirty sometimes...*never* in the groin. ThatÂ´s not just dirty, itÂ´s flat out cruel"
He walked over to the two newly arrived Jedi.
"Well, nice little shopping cart youÂ´ve got there. Find anything else?"
While talking, he started to browse through the crate, trying to see what they had found. As he kept the sealed door in mind, he searched particularly for any form of ion weaponry, or possibly EMP.

Surprised that he actually connected and that he caused the Merc to drop, Aymaric stands over Squirts with a look of disbelief. "I..I..umm..Sorry guy." Regaining his senses and a little bit of rational thinking, he continues to talk to Squirts while backing away. "That should be okay in a few hours, here take these." The medic, and recent conquerer of Squirts, pulls his med pack off his back and fishes out a bottle of painkillers. "Only take two an hour as needed, and no more than eleven a day."

"Huh? Yes, yes, I´m listening, but you called for the Sergeant, and I´m not even enlisted in the Republic military, so I guessed you weren´t talking to me. But go ahead, I´m all ears"
He went back to rummaging the crate. He sincerely hoped they weren´t going to try and bestow some army rank upon him.

Vor'en sees Master Lorhas come in with the cart full of weapons from the storage area he had found. He looks up at the Jedi Master. "Thanks, but I didn't get you anything." He picks up a few blaster packs and stows them where he can. slinging his carbine he pick up the light repeater. "Now where talking. Fire power on the go." He slaps in a blaster pack and ready the weapon. Looking back at the Jedi Master. "So you find any cigars in there?" Looking over at Gor. "Can you make use of the stuff that goes boom? I figure we rig small charges and use them as destraction if we have to or to destroy some stuff before we leave.

Gor 'Ak searches the repulsor crate and notices that this is all top grade military equipment. One weapon he finds is more specialized than any other weapon in the crate. It was a Xerrol Nightstinger sniper rifle. The weapon resembled a long sporting rifle but it had a scope and a specialized canister attached to it. If Gor 'Ak's memory served him correctly this weapon fired invisible blaster bolts and made it a perfect weapon to remain hidden while engaging targets. The scope fitted a top the weapon was also perfectly suited for engaging at long range. A sniper's dream weapon. This weapon however, made Gor 'Ak reflect on the last sniper they encountered. They had trouble tracking down that last sniper and it cost the lives of Pvt. Dorjidian, Theos, and Xander.
There was also plenty of canisters for this weapon and packs for all the other weapons as well. There were an assortment of rifles, pistols, blaster cannon, repeaters, grenades, and even two flamecasters.

"Son of a..."
Gor´s voice trailed off as he lifted up the weapon. It was a Xerrol alright, and he wouldn´t give high odds on the fact that the blasted sniper that killed three of their comrades - and nearly clipped himself as well - had used on of these. Well, nevertheless, it was a cutting edge piece of technology, and he suspected it might come in handy later on. Dropping of the weird net rifle he had picked up earlier, he suddenly realized he had no idea where the commando rifle he had been given when joining this mission was. When had he lost it? Well, well, in these corridors he preferred close-range handguns, but he decided to keep the Nightstinger.
While looking through the crate searching for heavy explosives, or illegal weaponry - disruptors, flechette mines, thermal detonators or similar things - he pulled out his holorecorder and took a short clip of the crate. He couldn´t help but wonder why the heck a facility like this would possess this amount of armament.

Having a former allie turn into a potential enemy, is going to make the current situation very difficult to handle with Aymaric's usual spirited attitude.
Kneeling down next to the Twi'lek's head the former Republic Medic addresses the bound swordsman. "So, my helpless friend, what are we going to do with you? Your friends left you here, and by the information they gave us you won't be exempt from any attack those droids launch against us." Pointing at the door where the droids were attempting to break through. "Tell us what you know and I might let you leave before they come and you get used as a meat shield or..."

Gor continues to search the crate and noticed that most of the weapons were standard and not exotic. The only unique weapon he found was the Nightstinger. However, all the weapons were made by Merr Sonn Munitions. So it wouldn't be unreasonable to believe there was some kind of deal between Merr Sonn and this mining facility. This is odd, because Merr Sonn is not likely to provide to an unlicensed organization. Most mining organizations are not commissioned to receive such weaponry. So any military grade weaponry here would be illegal if the guild was not licensed.
The contents of the crate were 20 fragmentation grenades, 30 blaster packs, 1 blaster cannon, 2 light repeaters, 3 flamecasters, 4 Nightstinger canisters, 4 blaster rifles, 6 snare rifles, 10 snare canisters, and 8 blaster pistols. There was no illegal grade weaponry present. It all seemed like equipment to outfit a military unit.
Lues Van observed the area for a moment and responded to Vor's question.
Lues Van: "I'm sorry...it's too difficult to tell. A detailed search of the facility is the only way we'll find Mur Eva. As far as intel, we found a datapad on a bed of one of the inhabitants."
The Jedi Knight handed Vor'en a red datapad with some graffiti on it. Vor'en heard this and also tried to determine the best course of action. Blowing the door open would likely shock the enemy and give them the most direct route to their target but it would likely be a vicious fight. However, going through the vents would give them the advantage of stealth. So it was either violence of action or the stealth option. The possibility was also there to just let the enemy in and set up a detailed ambush to unleash on the droids...that would be the most time consuming option.
The Twi'lek looks up to the medic with a look of despair. His basic had an accent that screamed he spoke Ryl regularly.
Twi'lek: "Why don't you just let me free first and we'll talk."
Squirts sees this and musters some strength to stand. He walks over to Aymaric and smiles.
Squirts: "Might want to start talking, as you saw he's not even afraid to hurt his allies."
The Twi'lek looks at the scalpel and begins crying.

Aymaric ignores Squirts and his comments, attempting to present an attitude of disdain towards the Mercenary. "It's simple really. I want to know all you know about this place, and the things you aren't supposed to know. Give me all of that and I will let you go without removing chunks of your flesh. Lie to me and I will know." Aymaric gives a slight node towards the Jedi in the room, hoping they didn't notice. Grabing one of the Twi'lek's Lekku hard he brings his scalpel to where the edge of the blade lightly touches the skin. "And be quick, we don't have a lot of time."
((Persuasion +3 to intimidate. If Aymaric happens to get to the new goodies, he would pick up the as many snare canisters as he can, all 10 hopefully. Also he would pick up at least 1 blaster pistol, maybe two and some frags. All of this depends on what is left and if time permits. Just an FYI so you don't think I'm ignoring you DW.

Making sure he got the full contents of the crate on holo, Gor picked up the canisters for the Nightstinger and put them in his bandolier. Noticing the lack of military-grade explosives, he picked up a number of fragmentation grenades, and several spare blaster packs as well. He also found what appeared to be a flamethrower - What the heck were this place anyway?? - which he decided to keep. He was no specialist in advanced weaponry, but he always found it nice to have a trick ace up his sleeve.
As he noticed Aymaric had started to interrogate the prisoner, he looked over at them and shouted in a stern voice.
"You might want to make him expand his story to cover why a mining facility would be commissioned military-grade weaponry enough to outfit a smaller military outpost"
The Bothan weighed one of the fragmentation grenades in his hand.
"In fact, if he doesn´t tell us what he knows, I think I will shove one of these down his throat...once you are done with him off course"

Pulling out a roll of mesh tape, Gor settles down on the floor in a cross-legged position. Rolling out 5 of the blaster packs he just picked up, he started to stick them together with the tape. It had been some while since he had used something like this. He really preferred industrially produced, military grade, *safe* explosive charges. But as they told him in the Spynet academy, "Use what is at hand". And well, a big bang could be useful to wipe those droids out.

Vor'en thinks through his option and the direct approach always did appeal to him but by what the scanner said the fight could take awhile. The vent might be a good option as well, but getting gear thought might be harder then it looked. Heavy weapons could be a problem. Of course there was the long way around, but that could take time. "Well as I see it we have a couple of options here. One we could blow the door taking out as many droids as we can before along the way. Or we could go thought the vents and sneak past them. Either way is going to take time. The explosion would give us surprise and that would help but if we get caught in those vents we are setting ducks. So I guess the door is the best way to go, unless both ways would get us what we want." Vor'en looks at the others." If that comes out at about the same place as that door does, we could send a team though and set up an ambush. Then we blow the door and get them in a crossfire. What you think?"

The twi'lek, who was clearly subdued and completely submissive, told more information to Gor 'Ak.
Twi'lek: "You see, all the big shots around here carry code cylinders. It gives them level 2 and 3 access which no one in the security detail has.

She seemed reasonable alright, but he wasn´t ready to just blindly trust anyone he met down here. And so far he couldn´t say that she had given them anything useful.

Awne glances up to the Ewok then over to her master, so much activity had picked up when the two jedi had joined them and the twi'lek had woken it seemed that the matter of the vent had been forgotten by the majority. She sighs softly "I don't know Kaz'jee...Masterr arre we using the vents?"

Awne feels herself slip deeper in connection with the Force as she focuses her concentration. Unlike the previous time she had channeled her senses, she couldn't feel Mur Eva anywhere. This whole area of the Force was saturated in neutrality and emptiness. She could feel her senses leading her to something but there was an extremely ominous darkness to that tangent. It was as if she knew a path that was too dangerous to travel down as there was no return. What she was feeling was not the usual calming and all-knowing life energy of the Force, it was more of a forbidden plane that was so dark she couldn't interpret.
Overall, this feeling was elusive to Awne. She felt emptiness and no true guidance from the Force. She could only wonder what the others were feeling. Perhaps she was beginning to feel what the other masters were feeling earlier when they said their senses were dulled; or maybe she had been enlightened more than they had.

Woro: "Awne claimed the same, Master, that she saw Mur Eva, but there was nothing there when I arrived." He thought for a moment, wanting to explain his reservations to his Master without seeming too accusatory towards anyone. "Honestly, I think Leus might know more than he has told us so far about Mur Eva's disappearance. It seems as if he has been withholding something this entire mission. And to be fair, his senses have not been correct about much since we got here. I know the Force is mysterious and is hard to understand, but as strong as he' is, it doesn't seem normal for him to be off like this." It all poured out of the wookiee. Just when he thought he was through talking, he couldn't help adding, "And I think Feldon can tell something is strange with Leus as well. We talked for a second about it back in the cave. He was troubled."

The Jedi Master seemed to be deep in thought as he continued to nonchalantly keep his eye on the others. He folded his arms and began to speak quietly.
Lorhas: "Well it makes things extremely complicated if this incident happened to both of them. It sounds like almost at the same time too. And yes, Lues does seem to be withholding information. But, I've sensed that he has been constantly searching since we've arrived. He's seeking something. Maybe we should talk to him about this? It seems like he has inner turmoil...but I don't think it's with his emotions. Have you you been able to detect differently in him?"
The Jedi switches his weight on his feet and continues to speak after taking a brief pause.
Lorhas: "Although it might seem he is leading us in the wrong direction, he did manage to lead us to one of the few inhabited places on Vjun. Seeing how there isn't much life to speak of here it wouldn't be completely irrational to investigate this complex. If Mur Eva is held captive then this could very well be the facility in which she is in. It would help if we knew the identity of the people we are dealing with."

The Jedi Knight also hears Vor'en and pushes his back up against the wall, ready to boost people to get in the ventilation shift.

"Yes we are Feldon. As soon as the ambush team is set we will blow the door and start putting blaster bolts in bad guys." Vor'en looks over at Awne. "You ok kid? If you need a minute just say the word." Vor'en knows that this planet has been had on the Jedi and his team the faster they can get out of here the better. "Ambush team when you are ready.

Carrying the unstable bomb over to the door, Gor was a little concerned that the sound coming from the other side of the door had decreased. As he began to arm the bomb, he looked around at the structure around the door. He would just hate it to see the entire thing fall down upon them as the bomb went boom.

As Gor set the bomb into place, he had a sudden nagging that this was not a good idea. He noticed the door was durasteel and the mention that the area was volatile made him feel very unsettled. There had to be a reason everyone was so reluctant to use blasters. Thus, did he really want to use a bomb here?
Back in the vent, the members of the group shuffled about and heard the echo of their movements in the air duct. The metal they were on was slippery and smooth. This situation made for a lot of noise as the group packed into the tunnel. It was quite large however...you could even kneel in this vent. Feldon whispered up to Kaz as everyone got comfortable for their movement.

Gor halted his efforts to place the bomb, and looked around the door again. The door itself was solid durasteel, and the fact that the sound on the other side of the door had stopped made him wonder if the bomb would even have the desired effect. And there was something else...he had this feeling, the one that usually came to him before he was about to make a big mistake. Like that time he had hesitated to slice a blast door open, only to work around it in another way, and later find out the door had been rigged with enough explosives to send him and the entire facility he had been in to orbit.
"Sarge, there´s...something wrong here. The sounds have stopped, meaning that the droids might not be trying to breach it anymore. Meaning that this little charge might not be enough to reach them. Also, this is not a directed charge. Meaning that while it might be able to punch through the door, a serious amount of explosive force will also be sent in other directions as well. And, well...people have told os not to use blasters since we came here"
He stood up and looked at the webbing keeping the door sealed.
"I would say we clear this thing and opens it the normal way. We can still attack any droids from two fronts, and we still have the advantage"

Vor'en looks at Gor. "Ok clear the webbing off. We still follow with the rest of the plan. Use the explosives only if we have to." Vor'en looks over at Lues. "Hmm. hadn't given it much thought. Kardoon will watch our six hopefully. Any other supplies need to be ready to move with us." Vo'en sets himself for what is about to happen. His mind runs through the training he had on CQB.

Her ears flick as her master tells the Ewok to move over the droids, that they were to be the ones to assault, it would be difficult to be sure; there were a fair few of them packed together, the vent was not the quietest thing and then who would be the first to drop down?

The team shuffled and crawled about 28 meters behind the ewok who was leading the way. Everyone could tell the ewok was right at home at moving through this tunnel as he didn't even have to bend over. Kaz arrived at a T junction and nobody could see anything in the pure darkness. The members of the group had to physically guide each other through the narrow path. Everyone could estimate they were likely just somewhere over the droids though, if they were still there.
Once they had shifted their direction left they moved a considerably longer distance from the first leg in the movement. They made another left and at that turn you could see illumination peering from below. It was a vent cover. Looking past the vent cover, you could tell the tunnel went on for a while. However, Kaz wasn't sure what was past there. The ewok looked into the vent cover but could barely see anything through the metal.
Feldon sat in the back of the line and whispered up to his padawan.
Feldon: "I'm not sure Awne. I don't even know what the Sergeant had in mind other than one of us is the diversion attack. Hey Kaz, you see something up there?"

The Sargent didn't have time to deal with unknowns on his battle field. They had away of biting you in the back side when it was least convenient. "Some one move her to some cover quickly so she will not be hit by her buddies in the next room. we need to make sure the the ambush team is set as well. We hit them first draw there attention to us then they will hit them and that should cause enuf chaos to make things easy for us."

As the Ewok looked through the vent (or tried to, rather) he looked back to Feldon with a questioning look asked very quietly "Kaz'jee open vent?" Although the question would be answered by Feldon most likely...it was also somewhat directed to Awne. Suddenly there would be a questionable odor that would roam the vents for a few seconds.

Awne moved as silently as she could with the others into the vent. Shifting and turning with them, her ears flicking and a wince given each time some noise reached her ears. As they reached a vent an odd odor reached her nose making her nearly gag and almost cry out for the vent to be taken off and fresh air to be reached; she refrained though just barely.

The two Jedi worked on all sides of the door with their lightsabers. After about a minute the door bent back a bit as the foundation was wearing out from the melted steel. Kel-Yun and Lues simultaneously channeled the Force to thrust the doors into the hall like large projectiles. The doors launched down into the corridor with violent force and skidded across the floor with a loud clatter. The Jedi raised their lightsabers up into an defensive posture and prepared to enter the area.
The members in the vent heard this sound right below them and heard the doors slide past just beneath their position. Either they were going to wait for Vor'en's signal or take that as the signal.
From the fresh entrance the Jedi had created through the doorway, you noticed the hall was empty of all creatures or droids. The lengthy hallway was the same as the other one they had encountered and the design was similar to the rest of the facility. Shining white background and doors lining the length of the corridor.

The only thing Gor would have liked less than finding a hallway full of droids, was to find a hallway that was not full of droids. Because that would mean the droids were somewhere else, perhaps laying an ambush, perhaps taking some alternate route around the doors.
Still holding his guns at the ready, he began to walk into the hallway, spying down the hallway, looking over the doors, trying to figure out where the droids had gone to. Suddenly something struck him, and now seemed as good a time as any to talk about it.

*MINUTES AGO DURING THE INTERROGATION OF THE TWI'LEK:*
Aymaric had decided his luck had held out long enough. Slowly packing his surgical kit back into his utility belt, the interrogator du'jour quietly exits the conversation now going on between Gor and the Captive Swordsman and makes his way over to the crate with the newly arrived weapons.
Sifting through the weapons, Aymaric locates a DeathHammer pistol. It looked a lot like the one his favorite Holo-Star carried on the wild space show *Corruscant the early years*. Frand Humbly, a soft spoken mercenary for hire, made his way around pre-space Coruscant gunning down bad guys with his trusty Merr-Sonn 434 "DeathHammer". "Die Slaggert" was Frand's favorite catch phrase when he was taking down a particularly bad mark with his "DeathHammer". This is the phrase Aymaric whispers as he raises the blaster and points it at a wall. "Die Slaggert. Pew-Pew...Pew-Pew." With a large smile, he quickly puts the pistol in his belt and grabs 6 power packs, 4 frags and all 10 snare canisters, rearranging his pack so he can fit all the new canisters.
*IN THE VENT WITH THE 3 DUST MOPS AND 1 JEDI:*
Since gaining the "DeathHammer", Aymaric had let himself be verbally moved around, not really paying attention to what was being said. He would hear his name and do whatever was said after it. Going into the vent didn't seem like a big deal, he had a really nice gun now, and felt he could take on anything just like Frand Humbly. The altercation with Squirts had been forgotten completely and now he just wondered how big a hole his new blaster would make in the first droid he shot. He was also wondering how mercaneries and miners managed to keep these old vents so clean. Looking forward he realized why with a smile, he was at the tail end of a very effective vent cleaning crew.

The Jedi cover Gor's back as he checks each of the doors. They walk slowly and cautiously with their lightsabers at the ready. Squirts was the one bringing up the rear of the formation. Kel-Yun responded to Gor's question as the bothan was leaning up to the doors to get a feel for the rooms.
Lorhas: "Best way I could explain it is that it feels like a bad feeling in your gut. Depending on your level of attunement to the Force this sensation is multiplied. However most of us, in our arrogance, tend to not look at it stupidity. We look at is as a honed sense of awareness that will not allow us to make stupid mistakes."
Gor did not get the feeling any targets where around whatsoever. He continued his search and noticed the room was relatively quiet except for the footfalls of his teammates. Gor interest is perked at the 3rd door on his left. He could hear what sounded like heavy machinery coming from inside. Was this room worth checking out? There were many other doors to investigate but he didn't get the feeling the droids where in that room.

The wookiee growled in Shyriiwook as he cumbersomely crawled past his teammates to the vent. He removed the vent cover and dropped into the hallway. Gor immediately spotted the wookiee close to the humongous door at the end of the hall. The Jedi padawan opened his mind up and let the Force guide him.
Although the wookiee felt aware of his surroundings, he felt that there was no way to accurately predict what was going to happen with the current plan. The future was always in motion and this whole planet had been misleading everyone's feelings.

Kaz'jee blinked as the big fuzzy moved past him and everyone else and out from the vent. He was now confused...werent they suposed to stay in...? He shakes his head and jumps through the vent with his vibrodagger at the ready. Landing on his feet he looks around and very carefully walks to put his back against the wall directly behind him, to get out of the way if anyone else wanted to come out.

Aymaric had begun to follow the others out of the vent, then a thought hit him. Speaking through his helmet Comm, he addresses Gor and the others. "Hey Gor, what about using the vents as a scouting tool? The sneakier sorts in our group could use them to guide the others forward and possibly help avoid traps and the like. So what do you think?" He sat back on his rear, hunched over in the vent, and waited for a response. "Oh and before anyone thinks it, I am not volunteering to be the scout. With this armor and my Med Kit I can't sneak up on a deaf Bantha."

"Huh. Had a feeling you´d say something like that. You know, I´ve been having that feeling all my life, but since I hooked up with you guys it seems to be coming on a more regular basis"
As he finished his search, he stopped in front of the 3rd door on the left and holstered the Ion blaster. He notices the others dropping out of the vent behind him, and pick up his comlink.
"Sounds like a solid plan. I think I´ve found something down here though"
He looks around for the rest of the group, and when everyone seems ready, he presses the button to open the door.

Gor opened the door and noted that he was walking into a fairly large room. Computer equipment lined the walls on his right and left. There was a mainframe that connected to the computers on wall directly to his right. It was likely this mainframe controlled everything.
To Gor's front, about 30 feet away was three tiers of treadmills. Above the final treadmill was three large mechanical blisters that set atop a large platform overlooking the treadmills. The blisters had yellow orbs on each side and they were shaped like a hexagon. Every few seconds, one of the blisters would release steam, likely as a cooling measure. The typical pipes you had seen throughout the facility all seemed to be connected to the blisters in some fashion. The pipes had tubes running from them into the mechanical blisters. The room had a very factory like look to it, and the entire room had industrial equipment dotted throughout. This area was also surrounded by rock walls, which told you whoever designed this facility worried more about the equipment than the design accommodations. This place had a red/brown look to it all. Not a creature was to be seen here either. The only sound you heard was the hum of generators and hissing steam. *Anyone in the room may make a knowledge technology check as a reaction.*
Back in the ventilation, Feldon held fast as the rest of the group dropped to the ground.
Feldon: "I guess I'll scout with you."

Gor walked up to the mainframe and examined it.
"Now I guess we are getting somewhere. This thing here looks like it is the central mainframe for this place, so there should be at least some interesting information in here"
He looked around for some sort of interface, and tried a couple of basic commands to see if he could get any response out of it.

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-08-30 12:58:43)

Gor recognized this type of machinery and equipment. It was used to mass produce droids. The pipe lines were used to cool the equipment and to fuel it. There were mechanical arms around the treadmills to piece together the droids. He estimated these pipe works were being run through must of the facility and its what had made the area volatile. However, the blisters were not enough to mass produce for profit on a business scale...it was exceptionally sufficient to create droids for one entity. He wouldn't know the type of droids it could produce, but that information would likely be in the computer. He could also guess the type of droids if he wanted.
Gor 'Ak activated the mainframe interface, it was the typical menu screen he had seen before.

This sophisticated computer would need those prerequisites to gain access. Slicing would likely not work and if it did it would probably give away their position. An extreme level of slicing skill could get around it. Was it worth the risk?

"Oh yeah...I found something alright..."
The Bothan slammed his fist into the steel of the mainframe - careful not to hit anything that could break - and produced his holorecorder again and made sure to capture all of the room on holo. Then he turned to face the others.
"You are right Lues, this is a production line. Designed to produce droids, and a lot of them. I´m not entirely sure what type of droids though, but my guess is that it could be the kind of droids we ran into earlier. The complete specs of the droids is probably in the mainframe though"
He sighed.
"The bad news is that this computer is protected in the same way as that other terminal, requiring both voiceprint and a code cylinder to get inside. It is possible I might be able to crack it, but I wouldn´t count on it. I would suggest for someone to go and fetch that vocabulator Aymaric tried to get out before...it might be of some help, who knows"
He hated it when people saw fit to use these kinds of protections on their computers. He started to examine the module where code cylinders would be inserted, trying to assess any way to put it out of comission.
((Knowledge(Technology) +11. Would it be possible to bypass the code cylinder request by disabling or manipulating the insertion module? Also, if possible, I´ll try to assess the type of droids created based on available equipment))

Gor 'Ak is aware that disabling the code cylinder port would simply lock him out. Furthermore, he'd only be able to figure out what type of droids were created by inspecting the production blisters. Lues was watching Gor's actions closely and spoke to the bothan in response to his fist slamming the mainframe.
Lues: "Look, this might not be the most important thing right now to worry yourself over. I mean, we still have to find Mur Eva. If we find her we should have plenty of time to gather information. I'm not trying to run this operation but we might not want to get stuck on everything in the facility. But...that's just my advice...take it or leave it. Information could be the key to rescuing Mur Eva."

Lorhas: "Yes, it seems we've found a droid production line of some sort. We haven't be able to establish the type of droids. They should be utility droids designed for mining or maintenance."
Back in the corridor in which most of the group had traveled through, Kaz 'Jee scoured the area for anything of interest. He noticed the bright illumination coming from the ceiling and it was blinding. He walked all the way to the end and spotted a holocamera over the doorway. It was still active and it was panning like normal. They were likely under surveillance right now.

He tapped the computer screen a few times.
"Thing is, I hate leaving things unfinished behind. Not to mention, this seems to be the central mainframe for this facility. Meaning that if we get access to it, we should have access to pretty much everything in here, including layout and those security cams.

"Um, alright...my checks are good. How's yours Feldon? Um, right, no equipment...well let's go then." He uses his head to point the direction he intended to go. "This way should be a good start."

She was only distracted when the Ewok had addressed her, blinking at him while her tail finally unwraps from itself deeming it safe and that she wouldn't be going back into the vent some time soon.
She looks towards where he was pointing and frowns "a camerra...Masterr Lorrhas, perrhaps it might be best if you rrid ourrselves of the camerra? We may alrready be watched but perrhaps it would give us morre time?"

"It´s a jammer that should be able to block out any security cameras we comes across.

While the group was discussing matters in the production area, Aymaric led the recon detail by moving ahead with much effort. The tunnel came to a turning point shortly after they passed the opening that dropped into the hallway. Feldon gave the go ahead and Aymaric turned into that path instead of going straight. Once they turned, the vents became much more of a tight squeeze. Aymaric had to fight with all of his will to push through the narrow and dark crawlspace. Once Aymaric got onto his belly and started shouldering forward, Feldon spoke out with noticeable reluctance. Aymaric could not even turn his head to look back to the Jedi.
Feldon: "I don't think this route is practical anymore. It's really dark and cramp. Can we even see where we are going to go?"
The dead silence that followed the Jedi's question was creepy. The thought of getting stuck in here was grimly nauseating. But, the idea that the Jedi Knight was buckling under pressure could be an empowering feeling for Aymaric or the chiss if they chose to go on. It was up to the medic to make the choice. Push through with their recon or turn back? Dropping through the vents could offer nice access to the facility or put the surprise on potential opposition.

Aymaric decides not to answer Feldon immediately. Not as a negative response to his statement, but as a pause to gather his thoughts and try to figure out why his helmet didn't seem to be able to cut through the darkness. Also, the Jedi's statement was a little unnerving. If he was reluctant to move forward then a simple medic should be reluctant as well. "I'm going to drop down and see what we have under us. " Removing the vent grate in front of him, he pokes his head through to make sure there was not anything that would cause him harm. Once the area below was visually clear, he slowly drops himself down to the floor below.

With a quick snort, a slight shake of his head and a "What the F...?" Aymaric comes back to reality. "Must need another nap." His under the breath comment is followed up by him reaching into his utility belt and pulling out a glow rod. "I think we should keep moving forward until we find a vent to check out." Aymaric pulls out the role of mesh tape he had in his belt as well. He waits for any opposition to his plan while he tapes the glow rod to the top of his helmet then turns it on. "Alright lets go. Hopefully we find this Mur lady with a huge star ship loaded with cash!"

Attaching the device to his bandolier, he moved over to the computer again.

Cracking his knuckles, the Bothan started typing commands into the console. He hadn´t exaggerated before when he said he hated voiceprints, he really did. But there were ways to go around them, and on the few occasions where they worked, he always felt really satisfied.

Vor'en continues looking around the large factory. "So any idea where to next? If Awne is some how picking up Mur's feeling or whatever could we be getting close?" The whole Jedi, Force thing made his head swim. If he could touch it or lay out in a battle plan or shoot it the old soldier was lost. He had of crouse gut feeling about situations but that really was spot on the jedi where about the force. "Could she be sending to Awne like you would follow a beacon of some kind?"
"Gor, you find anything that might tell us where to head to next? We need to know if we are headed in the right diection." Vor'en checks his crono to see how much time was left on mission.

Woro chuckles inwardly after hearing Kaz's description of he and Awne's friendship. He tries to not show his amusement, and responds to the little Ewok, "Sorry about your mate, Kazjee. But Awne and I are not mates, we are friends. Or maybe Awne is like my older sister," he says thinking about his friend. He moved closer to Kaz. "What happened with your mate?"

Aymaric's joke seemed to ease the tension a bit as he heard Feldon laugh; the chiss remained silent however. On that note, the group of three started crawling at a steady pace. The vents were resonating with the sound of shuffling bodies. Aymaric got the feeling that if anybody was underneath them they would definitely be detected.
The glow rod provides sufficient illumination so Aymaric could see where he was going. After about one minute of tedious movement, the vent split into a T formation and the medic was faced with a choice. He noticed numerous lighted grating down the left and right paths.
Feldon whispered up to the medic.
Feldon: "We should be in position somewhere above the rooms the team is near."
The Jedi Knight listened to his comlink chirp and refused to answer it.
Feldon: "Ugh...too awkward to answer that thing right now I can barely move!"
As this was happening, Gor 'Ak once again went to work on the computer that likely controlled the production machinery. He accessed the usual introduction screen...however...it was different.
12th MINING GUILD....
THE ALERT HAS BEEN CANCELED....

The situation with the console had changed. The bothan had not entered any commands yet though. Now the alert was off and maybe Gor could try to bypass the code cylinder request.
Sergeant Vor'en observed that they were 20 hours and 36 minutes into their mission by his chrono. By Vjun's time it was like 2 hours away from afternoon. Strangely, Feldon was not answering Vor's com transmission.

Kaz'jee looks down at the floor with a slight shiver as it seemed to get colder to him "Kaz'jee...was left. For another." It wasnt so much that he was angry or upset at remembering, he just was unsure of how to put things. "She found better mate...her parents said. Kaz'jee knew parents did not like Kaz'jee.....but then she come to say it herself." Looking up to Woro he gives a slight shrug that betrayed a bit of sadness "Kaz'jee over it."

Awne, who had been quietly talking to the two older Jedi's had felt her tail puff and freeze at the statement of the wookiee and she being mates. She turns to look at the two, laughing softly though she covers her mouth with her hand to cover as a cough. She moves over to the pair, catching the end of the Ewok's story and tilts her head, so he was left for another? "That's terrrrible Kaz'jee, I'm sorrrry." she rests a hand on his head in a comforting motion, looking up to the wookiee with a grin "olderr sisterr Worro?" she whispers to him, chuckling under her breath, at least she wasn't the only one that thought of the other as a sibling.

"How about more mature sister," woro says with a slight grin at Awne. He reaches down and pats the newcomer to the team, "Her loss then, Kazjee. You are obviously very brave, helping us explore this facility. She would have been lucky to have had a fearless mate like yourself." The wookiee paused, almost biting his lip before saying something that might only cause problems, but would probably be very entertaining. "And you know, Kaz, Awne doesn't have a mate either." He didn't even look at Awne after his last comment.

The Ewok had looked up once more to Woro as he was patted on the head. The words from the Wookie had seemed to lighten his spirits and he hugs him very tightly. "Good Woro." he says softly before looking up to Awne when he heard she didnt have a mate. "Why Awne have no mate...?" He then walks back over to her and looks up with expecting eyes.

Awne laughs with the wookiee, truth be told she didn't even really know how old he was, though perhaps 'more mature sister' was a better way to call her than anything else. She had to smile at the way the two interacted, like old friends or something with how close they seemed to have got-"And you know, Kaz, Awne doesn't have a mate either."-ten.....what?!
Her eye was twitching, she knew it was she could feel it doing it. What was that big carpet of a brother doing!? If he was trying to set her up with the little ewok she would have to remind him about a few things. What those were exactly were eluding her, but it was the same! the Jedi! yes there's one! Jedi don't have mates!
Kaz'jee's question and her own thoughts have her looking over to Lues in a half glare. "Memorries came up." was all she said looking back to the Ewok and trying to lighten her mood, damned Jedi and his memories, left her behind to pursue his training and...whatever it was he wanted to do, it didn't matter anymore to her, she had stopped trying when he stopped being responsive. She shakes her head to rid her thoughts and looks up to the wookiee "and if I rrecall...you don't have a mate eitherr Worro, apparrently we'rre the no mate grroup."

Kaz'jee saw the glare she had given Lues and quickly seemed to growl at him and take Awne's hand in his as he petted it. "Kaz'jee be Awne's mate for a little while...to make her happy if Awne wants...." He says with complete seriousness. True it was to make her happy...and he would be happy. Even though he had just come in contact with this group he already felt a closeness to the farghul and wookie....yet he couldnt quite place a name to it. He says nothing more of the matter and just continues to rub her hand while it was in his.

It seemed that the Ewoke had come to respect the "big fuzzy" and happily walked off with him. He whispers softly to the tall Wookie "What...happened before meeting Kaz'jee..?

"If you need to rest you can you know. Just want to make sure is all." Besides Woro, Feldon ,Lues ,and Lorhas she was the closest thing he had to family. He would never let her know his true feeling for her, cause he had to many bad memories in his life and endangering there friendship was something he did not want to do. Besides the old soldier knew better to mix feelings like that into the work. Could take him off his game and that was not going to happen if he could help it.

She levels him with a playful glare and pokes his shoulder "you should know betterr; and don't think forr a second I don't know about the talks of those awful cigarrs you likes so much, you know you'rre quitting when this is overr."
She laughs softly as she walks with him, true, she'd let him have one last cigar, but after that he was quitting if it killed them both, nasty things; she hated them, even going out of her way to steal them just to bury them later. His next question though has her sighing "yes...they arre, I know they arre...yes the forrce lead me astrray once....a few times alrready but I know that one was frrom herr. She's herre..she's knows we'rre herre...maybe she's trrying to help us now."

"And I am not planning a quit just yet. After this mission I am going to need both to keep from slotting whose every crazy idea this was."

"No no. I'll be okay. I just have to keep moving and keep my mind occupied. Thanks for the concern though." Shuffling again, very slowly, Aymaric starts to sing quietly to himself. The tune is a whisper, but still just loud enough that the handsfree mic is picking it up. "I'm a Lumberjack and I'm okay. I sleep all night and I work all day."

Crawling around a ventilation shaft with two humans that hadnt bathed in awhile wasnt Kardoons best idea of a good time, but Aymarics seeming fear of cramped places and the things he was doing to get his mind off of it was pretty amusing. "Hey Aymaric, maybe when we get out of here you can teach me that Jawa song, I've never heard it before." He didnt really care about the song but keeping the human occupied so he didnt freak out in the flimsy shaft was probably a good idea, plus he liked him ,a little quirky at times but seemed like a good person.

"I cut down trees. I eat my lunch. I go to the lav...." Kardoon's words cut into Aymaric's song too soon. He liked the later parts of the song and regretted that he would not be able to sing them. "Ya, it's a simple song. You just count down to one. My uncle tried to actually drink with the song. He lasted until one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one, then passed out on the living room floor." Aymaric was relaxing just a little. His pace was picking up as well. "So Kardoon, got any family?"

The medic continued to lead the way through the foreboding ventilation by taking a right at the T section pathway. He crawled to the light that was in view and stopped at a grating. He made sure not to crawl over it and peered into the screened opening.
Although he couldn't see much as their was low illumination in the room, he could hear a multitude of beeps and sound effects. The young human noticed various lights and monitors. It was likely a computer hub of some type. Aymaric wouldn't be sure unless he removed the grating and got a better look.
Feldon whispered up to Aymaric.
Feldon: "Why are we stopping? Are we getting out? I need to stretch out this is killing me!"
Back near the production room, Vor'en and his assorted security detail had actively scanned the room. They had also leaked into the hallway but everything seemed deserted at this point. It was all quiet in the hallway and the production room.
While the group was searching and talking, Lues had heard the conversation of mating. He made eye contact with Awne and then back to the others. He seemed indifferent, as if his Jedi Code had removed sensitivity from him. He was like a brick wall and it was no different when Awne felt his link through the Force.
Gor 'Ak had observed that the computer's situation had not changed. It was still only asking for a code cylinder. *Gor can make a knowledge technology check here as a reaction.*

Turning his head back to face Feldon and Kardoon, the scout leader Aymaric, nods his head. He gives no other indication of his intentions before he slowly pulls the ventilation grate up. Once he has the garte clear he slides it over, being careful not to make noise with it by banging or scraping it across the inside of the ventilation shaft.
After the grate is set down, the "Light headed' medic pokes his head down into the room to scan for threats.

Aymaric scans the room and notices that the room was dimly lit save for the computer screen's illumination. There was a vast network of computer machinery in this medium-sized room. The air was cool and smelled sterile. At the end of the room, past the maze of computer consoles, Aymaric could see the silhouette of a statue. It was in humanoid form and its arms were outstretched to the sky. There was a glowing blue piece on the statue that looked out of place. Near the statue, he saw a glimmer catch his eye from a lens. If he had to guess it was a holocamera.
However, that was all that struck Aymaric's eye. The room was desolate and the only life to be heard was the whirring of computers.

It didn´t matter what he did, the blasted computer wouldn´t budge.

It was hard to say if it was common sense or self-preservation instincts that stopped him. But he decided not to resort to violence just yet. Instead he took a deep breath and inspected the computer console again. There had to be something he could do.

Gor 'Ak noticed that some things were changing with the menu settings. They were slight, but it was enough to make him aware of something. The only way this computer would lower its alert level is if it was plugged into a network or had a remote access port. In either method, someone had to lower the alert level themselves.
Gor might be wondering why the alert level was decreased in this computer with another creature being responsible for it. It was possible that the enemy knew they were still alive so why would they decrease the alert level? The fact that this computer was acting without Gor's input could cause some concern.

Aymaric feels a slight jolt as his feet hits the smooth floor beneath him. The ground was so clean and smooth that it was slick. He immediately took in the surroundings as he kept his senses about him.
There was not a soul present that he could see. Computers were wall to wall in here and it was virtually a maze of hardware equipment. The ambient sound created by blips, whirs, and beeps was quite soothing. This was especially true in contrast to the adversity Aymaric had been experiencing. The room was dark except for the light projected from computers. The statue was to his left and the door to his right.
Feldon seemed to be watching Aymaric from the vent.

Looking back up at Feldon in the vent, Aymaric adrresses the hesitant Jedi with a wry smile. "Come on you weak kneed Chuba, there's no one here and there are alot of stuff that might be useful." Aymaric was enjoying the relative quiet and really didn't mind if no one came down with hi. He pauses for a few short seconds before moving over to the statue. "Hey Vor, I'm in some kinda computer room with a statue and a blue shiny thing. I'll take some holordings for later." The shiny object was distracting Aymaric's attention away from the lens just a short distance away. While walking up to the statue, he removes his holo recorder, trying hard not to just run up and grab the Blue object.

"No can do sarge, I think I´d better just leave this thing be. But it seems they´ve got the way cleared for us now. Just give me a second, I´d like to try something here..."
Before leaving the computer room, Gor moved over to inspect the various pipes and conduits running through it. Yeah, here he could do some serious damage. Picking up his makeshift bomb, he pulled out some mesh tape and rigged it on the pipes in a way that would cause the entire facility to go "boom" if the explosive went off. Without any means of getting out before he and the team would be killed he would never do that of course, but once he and his jammer left the computer room, whoever was watching them would see that he had left a bomb behind, placed on some really volatile stuff. Sure they might suspect a decoy, but would they be willing to take the chance that he really did have set a serious bomb that he could detonate at will. He guessed not.
After making sure the bomb was placed real good and clearly visible - but not visible enough for anyone watching through a camera to notice it was a decoy - he looked at Vor'en.
"Let´s go. In case the Galaxy decides to be a little cruel today, I´d like to at least have some distance between me and that unstable bomb"

Gor 'Ak followed the pipeline past the maze of conveyor belts and lifter arms. Steam hissed from the pipes and there were drips of fluid coming from every direction. He found an ample spot for the bomb but he quickly realized something. If he placed the bomb in the optimal position for damage it would be out of sight of any holocameras he knew. If he wanted the bomb to be spotted it would have to be back in front with the conveyor belts and computer equipment. He would have to make a choice.
Back in the hardware area, Feldon continued to observe the statue with the glowing blue stone embedded in it. The stone was on the left breast of the statue and it resembled a half of a heart.
Feldon: "I say Aymaric, I haven't seen something like this in eight years. This definitely piques my interest...and I'm just glad to be out of that eerie tunnel."

Aymaric wasn't trying to ignore him, he was concentrating on recording the objects in the room, especially the statue and the blue crystal. "So, what is it? Ya the the vent was pretty scary . Is it some kind of Jedi power crystal or something? One of those Sith Holocrans? Do you think Kardoon wil come down or is he up there guarding our back from dust Wampas?" His comments are distracted and random, the last one is said with one of his trademark smiles. The one that tells everyone he knows he's funny.

Feldon looked down and pointed to the ground for Aymaric to see. It was yet another stone, but this one had a faint green glow to it and was embedded in the floor. Its shape was that of a half-heart.

After a few moments of thinking, Gor decided to place the bomb where it would do maximum damage. Even if it wasn´t directly visible to those cameras, *he* would still know it was there, and could inform anyone that might be interested about it.

Gor decided to attach the bomb to a foundation of pipelines. He estimated that the explosion here would at least destroy the room; maybe even cause a chain reaction to take the whole facility down. However, the whole complex was surrounded by rock so that might make things difficult. He made sure the bomb was set correctly and verified it was in good working order. *What kind of trigger device you using Gor?*
As Vor'en was leaving the production room, he had noticed that Lorhas was on the fourth platform in the room. It was past the rising levels of conveyor belts. The Jedi seemed to be inspecting the large production pods. These pods appeared to dump something onto the conveyor belts and travel down. Kel-Yun Lorhas advised Vor'en to let him stay and continue his investigation.
Vor'en left the room and went only a few rooms down to a open door on his left. The computers in this room were abundant and created a maze of machinery. The statue immediately caught his eye and almost couldn't believe what he was seeing.

"I´d love to, but it seems like the sarge has found something to quite upset him. Sometimes I wonder how his nerves handles all the tension, he must learn to relax. Anyway, I think he called for you to, so we better get there"

It was before your time with us, if the light hits it should reveal a hidden door or lift to some place, never made it that far the last time. There could be heavy resistances if we try. It is also how Lues got his memory back. He activated a terminal near by and it allowed him access to the Falsoor main frame. Told him who he was and what he was." He turns to make sure the room was being secured. "I am not taking any chances with this. Help Aymaric find the controls to the lights sweep the area report to me anything you find. Go."

Trailing off the sentence as he walked away, the Bothan spy found a smile crossing his face. Some might call him crazy, but he always liked it when stuff got exciting. That probably was the reason he enjoyed working for the Spynet as much as he did. And bounty hunting offered quite a few surprises as well.

The entire group began flooding into the dark computer room at the sound of Vor'en's orders. Lues promptly closed the door behind him and activated a lock from the door control.
Master Lorhas swiftly walked to the back of the room towards the statue where Aymaric and Feldon were standing. Before that, he had ordered his padawan to watch the door closely. It seemed to be the only way into the area.
Lorhas: "Yes, this is definitely the statue we saw back at the Falsoor HQ. It seems to be too specific to be any other type of statue with the stone embedded in it. So why would this facility have this here?"
While the Jedi Master was talking to Aymaric and Feldon, Gor executed his sweep of the place. There didn't appear to be any imminent danger except what the two holocameras could present. The only thing interesting seemed to be the computers, which all had the 12th Mining Guild logo on the screen. The bothan was sure that these computers were all plugged into a network that ran only in this facility. So there was no way an outside network source could exchange information to here. This was likely a secure information pathway. He tampered with one computer a bit and saw that absolutely no one could intercept computer signals outside of this complex.
The network set up here was sophisticated and cutting edge. Everything was encrypted and it was hard to access information. There had to be a reason why computer security was so tight.
Lues walked up behind the statue and pointed to a light switch.
Lues: "Well Master, if its anything like before we should only have to push this switch to open a secret room."
Lues looked over to Vor'en as what to do next. The Jedi Knight seemed to get emotionally distraught very quickly though. As if he was reluctant to push the switch.

Vor'en looks at Gor. "Ok, everyone stand by." He looks over at Lues. he realize that this is hard for his friend and no one should have to go through this twice. "When you are ready Lues, go for evreybody is ready." Vor'en walks up next to where Lues was standing with Aymaric and the other Jedi. Looking around at the rest of the team. He readys his weapon for all hell to break lose. "i hope this goes better then the last time."

*What the hell!* Standing next to Feldon, Aymaric had been contemplating a response when Voren burst into the room and starts barking orders! Aymaric fumbles the camera a bit, catching it before it hits the ground. "What's all the noise about Sarge? You nearly made me deposit an Exogorth in my shorts!" Verifying his pants were in fact empty, Aymaric finishes putting the camera away. While doing so he notices that everyone else seems to be on edge and most of the party have there weapons drawn. "Are we expecting company? Why is this statue so dangerous?" Drawing his own weapon, the Net rifle, he waits for something to happen.

"Yes, Aymaric I am expecting trouble. I have seen this statue once before and it didn't end well. I just want everyone ready for anything." Vor'en keeps thinking that his people think he is insane for acting the way he has but a few will understand why. Maybe he was over reacting, he didn't care he wasn't lossing any more of his team if he could help it.

Lues nods to Vor'en and reluctantly steps over to the button behind the statue. He hit the switch and the small studio lights projected right on the statue. The shadow from the statue hits the stone on the floor and all of a sudden both stones form a full red heart.
The statue began to shake and rumble quite loudly. It swiveled to the left and in that direction a piece of the wall slid up to reveal a man-sized secret entryway.
Lues looked back at Woroken who was guarding the perimeter to check if everything was ok.
Lues: "This is just like Nar Shaddaa."
Once he was cleared, Lues stepped into the dark entryway with Lorhas right behind him. Who was going to follow their lead?

As he passes Vor'en, he help the sergeant up, and checks to ground to see what his friend had stumbled upon. At Lorhas's comment, he gives the Jedi a friendly grin and points to the metal cylinder at his side.

Voren had given Aymaric enough reason to take the current situation more seriously. "Right behind you Sarge." He pauses and lets the rest of the advance party move the entrance of the secret passage way. As the last one goes through, the ever curious Medic moves up close to the statue and eyes the blue jem embedded in its chest. "I wonder..." He pulls out his vibro dagger and attempts to remove the gem, turning the blade on once he has it touching the heart shaped blue object.

Lorhas responds to Gor promptly.
Lorhas: "You're right. However, I like to keep my weapon on its clip at all times unless I need it for self-defense. It's just a strange thing about me."
Gor 'Ak activates his glow lamp and the first thing he notices is a body laying on the ground next to where Vor'en had tripped. Gor quickly searches for a light and activates it. Illumination quickly fills the room. The area was quite narrow and there were computer machinery lining the walls. The machines started humming to life once the lights were powered on.
At the end of the short room was a central console and monitor. It seemed to be connected to the computers that were embedded into the walls.
Vor'en was quick to notice the body laying next to him and he appeared dead. The person was an older human male with a silver jumpsuit and white lab coat that was ragged/singed. His eyes stared blankly in front of him as if he had died a frightful death.

Luckily for Gor, he wasn´t the jumpy type. If it was because of the meditative techniques he used to keep himself calm, or simply because of a life that had seen the most, he didn´t know. But finding out that the thing Vor'en had stumbled upon was a dead body merely caused him to raise an eyebrow. As he looked around he only saw more of the machinery that seemed to dominate this part of the facility. This room did appear to be somewhat different though, but he couldn´t really pinpoint why.
As he noticed the white lab coat on the body, he kneeled down to examine the corpse. Perhaps this man would possess the very elusive code cylinder that could allow him to unlock the network in this facility. At least he got the impression that the dead man had worked here. As he started to work through the pockets of the coat, he slid his hand over the mans face and closed his eyes, and closed his own in a moment of reverence for the dead.

Gor 'Ak rolled the body over of the short gray-haired human. He was clean shaven and wrinkled. He immediately noticed a cauterized slash going from his chest down to the opposite side of his stomach. This is what likely killed him.
In his left breast pocket, he found a code cylinder. There was only one of these to be found. The right breast pocket bore an identichip. In his coat; he found a datapad, credit chip, and a short-range comlink. The credit chip seemed to have 10,000 credits on it and was linked to an account (locked). The coat was burnt so its likely this person took fire damage of some sort.
The identichip would have to be plugged into the datapad to get information. Whatever had killed him had not cared about his possessions obviously.

*Finally*
As Gor examined the body and found the code cylinder, he almost cried out of joy. When he found a datapad and an identichip as well, he felt highly satisfied. Finally, he might be able to shed some light to the many mysteries surrounding this place. Among the other things he found was a comlink and a credit chip with a substantial amount of credits linked to it. It was of lesser priority now however, and he could slice it later to gain access to the money.
"Okay, I think we have finally found something that can help us on the way with our mission. This identity chip should be able to tell us who this guy where, and probably what he was working with. And with this code cylinder the network should be open for usage. Unless the blasted mainframe reactivates the voice protocol, in which case I might just blow it to pieces"
He inserted the identichip into the datapad and brought up the contents of the respective devices.

"Why would it turn red?" Pulling his knife back from the gem Aymaric voices his concern over the gems color change. "Hey guys. The gem on this statue just turned red. Do you think that's some kind of warning?" Aymaric moves down the stairs, narrowly avoiding the burnt man on the stairs. Bending down to examine the wounds the man suffered, he notices the same patterns as the ones from the people they found a few days ago in the Falsoor facility. "Did anyone else notice how this mans wounds are the same as those people we found back at the research lab?"

As the text began to scroll on the screen, one particular sentence caught Gor´s attention.
"Doctorate/Head Research in Bio-Engineering"
This brought back some memories of the lightsaber wielding monstrosity they had run into before. This just got more and more complex at each turn. What seemed to be a military facility disguised as a mining station, and now bio-engineering...
As he heard the declaration that the man had been killed by a lightsaber, he got to his feet.
"Well, do you remember that mutated freak we ran into before, the one with the lightsabers? This guy was head over a bio-engineering research department. It might be possible one of his creations broke loose and didn´t quite appreciate his treatment"
He casts a look at Aymaric and Feldon.
"A lightsaber cauterizes wounds, right? Is it still possible to assess when the injury was obtained? Because given the condition of this body, I´d say he don´t look to have been dead for too long. What do you say doc?"

Gor wasn´t really sure what he should have expected, but in any case, this was much more than that. As he skimmed through the list of recently accessed topics, several words or phrases he usually associated with not completely normal business appeared. "Genetic Enhancing", "Force Infusion", "Saboteur", "Rebirth", "The Reaver", "Cloning", "Shadow Project"...
"Guys, I think we hit jackpot here. Or maybe not, since I suppose there are a lot of people that doesn´t want us to see this"
Considering the sheer volume of data this thing had to contain, he suspected there was no way he could store it and bring it with him, as he was not too interested in the Chiss's solution, to carry the memory units around. Instead, he began to search the mainframe for some sort of long range communication and data transfer systems. Because he knew places where he could easily stash information like this, and he also knew some people that would be most interested in it.

Lues walked over to Gor and spoke.

The chiss observed the others in the small room. Most of them seemed preoccupied with Gor on the computer. Sergeant Vor'en was resting. The Jedi Master on the other hand, seemed to be observant of everything.
Kardoon looked over toward the panels of the computer storage but they were firmly in place. He wasn't sure if they had any security measures though. It would take some elbow grease to pry them loose. Did he want to go through with this?

"I was searching for ways to send this information offplanet, back to HQ, or perhaps to the ship. It would take some time for even a trained evaluation team to go through it here, and I don´t think we have the time"

Using his tools, the chiss carefully unscrews the panel loose and pops it open gently. As he is slowly removing it, he spots a wire that looks out of place. If he removed the plate completely it would likely snap the wire.
As Kardoon is working with the memory storage, Gor opens the Security Division topic on the monitor.
Falsoor&#39;s Security Upgrade
Despite our numerous efforts to get better defense weaponry, we've met numerous setbacks. Most Planetary Defense Forces are not approving our authorization to carry military-grade weaponry. The debate is shifting towards the fact that we are planetary restoration and we don't need such equipment. Supposedly, defense can be provided by the entity in which we provide restoration efforts toward. This presents a problem with less militant systems.
The Republic seems to be shifting its view to that of the respective systems as well. Overall, it doesn't seem that Falsoor will be able to get anything over minimum security authorization. It seems unruly for Falsoor to be outfitted like an army, but traveling to foreign planets can be dangerous.
(Personal Notes: Despite official sanctions, it seems military grade equipment has begun to filter into our ranks over the years. I don't like this at all. It definitely makes the workplace seem more tense. Luckily, I don't have to deal with the big gun toting individuals. I'm getting paid so much I can keep my mouth shut.

Once Gor finished man-, or should I say Hound, handling the Doctor's body, he takes time to place the battered body in a respectable pose, out of the way.
Satisfied that he had done his best for the Sabre victim, Aymaric moves over the screen and peers at the screen over Gor'ak's shouder. He is intently watching what Gor'ak is doing when an idea sparks in his head. "Hey Gor, try the camera feeds. Maybe we can see what we are up against and find that Eva lady." Afew moments later his rapidly probing eyes focus in on the little foot note just above the camera feed option. "Hmm... maybe his killer left a message. Like, I'll be here at nine to kill you, so don't be late or I'll kill you." Again, Aymaric realized that his mouth had outrun his reason, and he winced. "Oh, sorry, wrong time for that."

The chiss is able to successfully lengthen the wire behind the panel. It was cumbersome to do the work without fully removing the panel, but he had gotten it done. Looking past the panel, he saw a multitude of memory boards. No doubt this was keeping an immense amount of information for the mainframe. The question was, if he took these memory plates would it have any effect on Gor's investigation?

Kardoon looks at the memory boards, each the size of a dinner plate, some wires were attached to one and he slowly and carfully began to remove it, guessing it was the power wire, most servers were what whas called hot swappable, meaning memory units could be added and removed without interupting service while powered. He begins slowly easing it out of its slot in the mainboard.

No now it was young Ben being killed by the gang they had ran a foul of on Tantoonie. It was His Mando friend that was pulped in his own armor.

Gor 'Ak opens the topic Force Infusion and text begins to scroll on the screen.
We owe the success of the Reavers and the Shadow Project to this expert technique. Force Infusion may come off as simplistic but cannot yield favorable results unless calculations are extremely precise.
We were able to follow Dr. Jenna Arbor's work and come to our own conclusion. A well produced Force infused subject is a great base model to produce multiple clones of a Reaver. Using this method, we will never have to worry about a shortage of Force Sensitive subjects. This is a breakthrough in science of astronomical proportions...and it must be kept low-profile.
In essense, a good subject has the ability to utilize the Force due to artificial injection of midi-chlorians. While this method is quirky, we have ironed out most of the kinks throughout the years. If the incorrect measures of infusion are used, expect terrible results for a subject.

Gor realizes that the computer was treating him as an administrator. So the encrypted file is able to be rewritten by the bothan. Needless to say, he has almost instant access to the video after this. He pushes play and a holoprojection plays just beside the mainframe computer where everyone could see. A narration goes with the projection.
Subject name: "Vesslyn Mur Eva"
A live image of a beautiful red haired woman restrained to an experimentation panel is shown. She seemed to have a look of emotional distraught on her face. Multiple tubes were hooked into her body...she was definitely in pain.
"Although the subject was resisting at first, I think she's begun to accept herself as a stepping stone to take a giant leap forward into science. This person's connection with the Force is exceptional. I'm trying to deplete the blood from Vesslyn with minimal pain. Hopefully, death will not ensue as this is certainly not desired. It would really make a mess of things. Thankfully, she doesn't realize the power she possesses and we are able to keep her restrained."
"I think I will require a much higher volume of midi-chlorians. BDM-7, give her some type 7 sedative."
Vesslyn begins to scream as she was being abused. A medical droid is seen hovering to the woman and she is injected. She promptly goes unconscious.
The holovid seems to be loading another portion of the data...
Lues Van seems completely shocked, and the other Jedi didn't seem to be taking this all in right now.

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-10-19 23:08:54)

While the group is viewing the holovid, Gor notices that the monitor shows the date of the recording goes back to 16 ABY. These events had happened years ago. The holovid goes to the next segment...
The woman who appeared to be Vesslyn was strapped into the experimental panel. A number of medical containers hooked to tubes were surrounding her. Various other medical equipment resided near the woman and it showed these machines linked to the vulnerable woman.
It was a horrific scene of medicine being used for the wrong reasons. A younger version of the deceased man you recently found can be seen strolling next to the experimentation board. The man spoke into the holovid.
Dr. Haliford: "The subject has been drained of a tremendous amount of blood. We've managed to utilize the blood in isolating this woman's midi-chlorian cells. We have all the usable amount of midi-chlorian samples that we'll need. The first step of the plan has went perfectly."
The doctor roams around and the holovid tracks him to another half of the laboratory where you see various lab containers, they seemed to be holding blood. The blood didn't look normal, it looked thinner. The liquid also seemed to be illuminated.
Dr. Haliford: "Although these midi-chlorian cells are not completely prepared to be introduced to a new host, they will be soon after we cultivate them with various amounts of treatment. After the treatment is concluded and the midi-chlorians are ready to be infused, we'll need a similar test subject to those we have extracted the cells from. We'll need a host that is biologically related to you, Vesslyn. This new host, if my calculations are correct, will have its Force potential tripled by the infusion of more midi-chlorians. In theory, this Infusion technique can grant the power of the Force to any individual or bolster the existing ability already."
The scientist orders the other droids and humans from the laboratory. He walks over to Vesslyn and caresses her cheek. The woman spits in his face with what seems to be her last bit of energy.
Dr. Haliford: "The new host I need will come from you Miss Eva... Now, what I'm about to do to you is in the interest of science. However, I won't hold it against you if you take any pleasure in this...."
The man laughs as he crawls on top of the restrained woman.
Dr. Haliford: "I know I will....hahahaha!"
The group watches in sheer horror as the scientist proceeds to rape the woman in the video known as Vesslyn Mur Eva. It was shocking what this bizarre experimentation video had entailed...what crimes was Falsoor responsible for?
Lues seemed to be breathing very rapidly and was losing his calm quickly. The low-illuminated room was filled with tension. The deep, low, blood-curdling moans of Vesslyn echoed through the heads of Red Team as this unfolded. This was like a nightmare come true.

Awne stared in horror as the video played, barely realizing that the human beside her had woken and asked a question, how could someone do that to another? She moves forward, beside Lues she found herself though by no real thought.
The second video plays, what would happen this time? so much blood had been taken what else could he....the farghuls eyes widden, her hand moving to her mouth in horror. She could feel the Jedi beside her near shake with rage, she couldn't blame him; shock would leave her body eventually and she knew that in it's place the same rage would well within her, she could feel it slowly rising.
That was how Mur came into being? through pain and experimentation? to an unwilling mother and a sadistic cold-hearted rat of a human who didn't deserve to be called a father let alone a human?? Her free hand clenches into a fist, the hackles on her neck rising as a low growl sounds from her throat, eyes narrowing to the holovid, tail curling and puffing in anger; if that rat hadn't died already he would have been in a matter of minutes when she got her hands on him.

Gor silently watched the video, with an indifferent expression on his face. It was not pleasant what he saw, but he didn´t seem to take it as hard as the others did. Perhaps he had been living too long on the shadow side of the Galaxy, but even brutal stuff like this seldom got him very riled up. Sure, it was disgusting, and very wrong, but things like this - and worse - happened all the time. He cast a look over at the dead body, thinking that the man had been offered the easy way out. But if he had been alive by now, that would probably had changed soon enough.
Turning back to the screen, Gor backed up to the topic screen. He cast a glance at Kardoon, and suddenly noticed that the Chiss had already begun to remove the memory units from the computer equipment.
"Hey, slow down a minute. Let me get all of this on tape first. We need a backup on it anyway"
Proceeding to go through the contents of the computer, he decided to explore the topics of the Shadow Project and The Reaver.
((If you want to speed things up, or there isn´t anything that you´d think is important at the moment, you can just fast forward through. I just want to make sure Gor has checked at least some of the data through to have a hint of what it contains, as well as getting it all on holo, It seems like a good idea to have more knowledge of what is actually going on, but I don´t have to roleplay it out, since that could take a while))

When Gor goes to turn off the holovid, Lues steps next to him and asks him to stop.
Lues Van: "Wait Gor, I've seen this before. Let this play out."
The next portion of the holovid rolls over and you see Vesslyn screaming in pain. Droids were surrounding her and probing like mechanical insects.
Dr. Haliford: "Now, we are moments away from the birth of the new host. We've been using advanced growth acceleration to speed up this process but it has taken its toll on Vesslyn. She is about to die but we should get the host before then."
The droids manage to successfully deliver a healthy baby girl. Vesslyn fades unconscious shortly after. The woman had been screaming with dry moaning and high fatigue. She didn't look healthy at all.
Dr. Haliford: "Success! Subject delivered! This will be the primary host for the Force Infusion. The host will undergo tripled growth acceleration while receiving Infusion and genetic enhancements. The Reaver should be ready in a couple of months."
Vesslyn fights her fatigue as she tries to look at her newborn. The baby is hooked into machinery and repulsor-lifted away.
Vesslyn: "My baby....noooo...Jes Mur....you will get out of here and make your own life!"
The woman appears to pass away after wishing the best for her child.
Dr. Haliford: "A shame, she has finally given up. At least she got to see her child and give her a name. I suppose that she can keep her name, Jes Mur Eva. Otherwise she will be known as the Reaver!"

"Great, so the person we are after is a genetically enhanced, experimental project created by scientists in this lab? And I though this was bad when we were just hunting a fallen Jedi"
The Bothan turned back to the computer and continued to record all the available information carefully. while mostly skimming through the topic files, he did pay close interests to these mentions of a "Shadow Project" and specifications for "The Reaver". He was far from convinced that they would not end up fighting her, and he intended to have as much information on exactly what abilities she possessed - other than the regular Jedi stuff - and even more importantly, her weaknesses.

While Kardoon is busy creating a makeshift backpack, the holoprojector goes to the next scene. This time it shows a young girl in a tank similar to the setup of a bacta tank. She was completely immersed in liquid and unconscious. She was wearing a mask and had a number of tubes hook into her body. There were also some mechanical arms working on her. Dr. Haliford and some lab technicians were documenting the progress of the child.
Dr. Haliford: "This technique we're using is advanced growth acceleration. It quadruples the rate of growth and is extremely risky to the organism. Fortunately, we've had other experiments with advanced growth acceleration before Jes here. We are providing Mur Eva with the most advanced nourishment package imaginable. We've gained this knowledge and resources from our experience with life and ecology restoration. Completion of this package will result in an incredibly healthy human being."
The doctor moves to the tank and pushes some keys into it. He looks back toward the holovid.
Dr. Haliford: "Following the work of the Kaminoan's and our head cloner Zom Teem, we predict that Jes Mur will be a teenager within months. The calcuations we've come to predict that advanced growth acceleration cannot be push into adulthood, as that would kill the subject. We'll only be able to support her growth to 16 human teenage years. But, if successful, all future human subjects can be of a military-fighting age within a year. This is a leaps and bounds improvement over cloning procedures in the years past."
Dr. Haliford: "However, my Kaminoan colleague predicts complications in Mur Eva's muscle growth, maturity, and bone structure as the person grows in age. How long Jes will live is not a concern of mine. The question here is can we produce Force-sensitive creatures in record time... If I'm correct....the Reaver's problem will not matter as her abilities will be augmented by her extreme sensitivity to the Force. We don't have the time to test their life spans but I estimate it will be at least 15 years after completed growth acceleration. Finally, Jes has also received genetic enhancements as a part of her Force infusion. This was introduced in early pregnancy. As a result, she will be extremely aggressive in her life and will yield tactical genius."
Dr. Haliford : "When all is said and done, Jes Mur Eva will be a Force-wielding warrior in which we can rapidly clone an unstoppable army."
The information that was being conveyed to the team was incredible. What was going on? Where did they go next? Did they continue to gather information or look for Mur Eva? There seemed to be more scenes on the video recordings that belonged to Rom Haliford.

I understand you may resent me now in some ways, but at least now we can see we're taking the steps to bring Falsoor to justice."

Vor'en looks at the Jedi master. "But you are right our looses have effected me, and now that I am completely in charge of the mission you want to make sure that I am not going to order everyone off this rock and head for home. No that is not what I am going to do Lorhas. i am going to find Mur Ev and bring her home." Vor'en means every word he is saying. He has never back down from anyone or anything in his life.

Mass produced Force warriors...that would be the greatest threat the galaxy has ever seen. This could potentially be the greatest superweapon ever known. And to top it all off this is in YOUR hands."
The Jedi looks around the room and then gets closer to the Sergeant.
Lorhas: "I don't know what Mur Eva and Lues talked about to get her to come here, but it doesn't matter anymore. If all this information is true then you could be responsible for the fate of an entire galaxy. You understand that if this data falls into the wrong hands what it could mean? I hate to say this...but Mur Eva's fate might be second to this. Her duty is to protect peace and justice through the galaxy, and we've just uncovered something major."

"We still need to find the Mur Ev and bring her home. The Jedi is the only normal thing in her life as far as I can tell." Vor'en looks around. "Do we know what if any Lues involvement in this? He seems to regain some memory of what happen to him all the time. Could he be the same as Mur or does he have no knowlegde of this?" Vor'en was asking hard questions for the Jedi Master to answer. He may know the answers he may not but Vor'en hated surprises. "When we find Mur and get out of here I am going to regamend to Command that they level this place and put Falsoor down like the animals they are."
Looking at the Lorhas. "So any idea where to start looking for Mur at?"

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-10-21 14:59:42)

Lorhas: "I've noticed that about Lues as well. Well, this is the Republic's mission primarily. We've gotten no directive from higher so our top priority is still rescuing Mur. I guess we can continue to accomplish both tasks simultaneously. But I will say this...if it comes down to Jes or that data getting out of here...well, may the Force be with you."
The Jedi makes his way back to the secret room. It appeared as if yet another segment had started.
Lorhas: "If you want to find her I'd suggest looking up the holocamera feeds and try to download any area maps. Maybe putting those two together will help."
Dr. Haliford is shown with a lab crew standing in front of the capsule with Mur Eva. He walks up and pushes a button.
Dr. Haliford: "Here we are, two odd months later. The subject has reached roughly 16 years of age in body configuration. It's time for her education to begin."
The equipment from Mur Eva's body pops loose and the fluid begins draining through the bottom of the tank. After the fluid is completely drained, the young girl lays in the bottom of the tank shivering immensely. The doctor makes sure to carry her out of the capsule.
Dr. Haliford: "She will be experience muscle atrophy and blindness, but these are both temporary. Once these wear off she will be in great condition."
The twisted doctor looks to Mur Eva and whispers.
Dr. Haliford: "Hi young lady, I'm your father. Can you say daddy.....daaddy?"
The young Mur Eva looks up with her eyes shut toward the direction of the voice, she lets out a low moan.
Then, the holovid rolls over to another portion. This time Mur Eva is depicted in a black uniform, she appears to be in a class room setting of some sorts. An older lady seems to be teaching her the language of Basic. Abruptly, the video cuts out here. It resumes after a few seconds to see Dr. Haliford and a cloaked figure with a mask in conversation. This part of the video appears to be dated two years back.
Dr. Haliford: "We lost the original Reaver to the Shadow Project years back. But, I'm afraid we'll just have to continue with the substandard Reaver's."
Masked man: "It makes no difference. We can always obtain the original Reaver on a later date. These Reaver's will be enough for any task we might set....this is all going to my plan either way."
Dr. Haliford: "Yes Lord Strife, they are in formation out here."
The holocamera pans toward a balcony overlooking a vast open area. The two figures walk onto a balcony that appears to be overlooking a grand gathering of females. More specifically, they were thousands of Mur Eva's locked in a rigid position in formation. The scientist spoke with adrenaline oozing through his voice with excitement.
Dr. Haliford: "Master Strife, here are your children, the greatest army assembled in the history of the galaxy!"
Lord Strife: "With this, I will effortlessly return the Golden Age of the Sith...with this ARMY, NONE shall stand in my way and resistance will be utterly futile. My horsemen shall usher in an age of peace like none ever seen before."
The apparent Dark Lord of the Sith outstretches in his arm in a menacing pose.
Darth Strife: "Reavers! Raise your weapons for the glory of the SITH!"
The thousands of Mur Eva clones ignite their crimson lightsabers simultaneously and wave them to the right side of their body. It sounds like a gigantic lightsaber moving as one entity that would intimidate any person. With their left hands they fill the air with lightning, and a triumphant Strife stands reveling in the ambient scene of destruction.
The holovid cuts out, leaving a very appalled Red Team as they see what they are up against.
The holovid had no more information on it, and Gor 'Ak was back to the menu screen on the computer.
Also, those watching the video can make a Knowledge galactic lore to identify Strife's mask.

Lorhas: "You're a good apprentice Woroken. By the way, I need to fill you on some things Falsoor had been hiding."
The Jedi gives the wookiee all the information he saw on the video, including all the graphic details. He tells him that Falsoor has indeed been up to no good.

Woro muttered to Lorhas "I always felt close to her because of her skills in battle, but to think they were put in her by an evil scientist..." he trails off.

Vor'en, Kaz, and Awne walk back out into the bright white hallway they had traveled through so much. It was a sort of respite from seeing the grim holovids as they could stretch their legs out and get a change of scenery. They had a number of doors down the left and right sides if they wanted to search this hall still. At the end of the hall, was a larger door which looked more durable than the others.
Of course, if the hallway wasn't enough, they could always go back to the reception area and see if anything of interest was there. OR, they could look into the lift in which they saw a droid travel into. Other than that, there was another hallway on the other side of the reception room in which the Jedi had initially cleared at the start of the breach.

"Sarge, you might want to know this. A message just arrived for the dead doctor. All sensitive personnel is to be transferred to P-57 and moved to another location by nightfall. They seems to be pretty serious about this, as they´ve declared anyone not there will be left behind, and ordered them to leave all this big, expensive equipment.

The past few minutes seemed to pass like a lifetime. Aymaric had been staring at the Holovids and ignoring everything else around him. His mind not letting him look away. As every second ticked away on the Vids timer, he became more and more angry, fustrated and depressed. He heard nothing except the noises that the lady on the films made and a slight droning of voices, as if he were next to a room full of talking people. His face showed no emotion other than a little reddening around his cheeks. His body had become stiff with tention and remained that way through all the Vids being displayed on the screen, until Sergeant Vor'en called everyone out of the room.
His reply surprises him, being jovial and calm, completely opposite from what he was actually feeling. "Roger Sergeant, just a moment!" Many thoughts were running through his head as he stares at the now naked body of the dead Doctor. A very soft muttering is all anyone would hear from the traumatized Falsoor Medic. His voice is so quiet that he can barely hear himself talking. Anyone standing next to him might just think he's breathing heavy or humming. "Whoever killed you, must of hated you less than I do right now. Because they let you die too fast, way too fast." His thoughts are violent and cruel, but he knows they aren't cruel enough. He also knows he doesn't have time to do the things he really wants to do to this utterly sick man. His depression grows as he realizes that these dark thoughts aren't dark enough for this criminal, nothing he does will make up for what has happened.
So he left him there, naked, neglected and scarred. "I'm ready to roll Sergeant."

Finishing his preparations to rescue Mur and get out of here he hears Awne words of warning. "Are you sure of that Awne? If I can I mean to pull that girl out of here with us." Vor'en runs through his head thing that might happen, walking into a trap was never ago idea unless you had an ace in the hole of your own. "Ok if we are going to pull this off I need oppition people. Gor has a ship getting ready to leave and Lues senses her as well. We could go in hot and hopefully over whelm them." Vor'en was hoping that his people could figure it out and they could be out of here fast.

Red Team continued to bustle in anticipation of action in the hallway. The kaminoans were staying put and being completely cooperative with the interrogators. They didn't appear to be threatening either. They had no weapons or holsters. It was as if you had stopped normal lab personnel.
Female Kaminoan: "We make clones of the Reaver. In addition to cloning, we are also responsible for their well-being. We educate them, keep track of their records, and provide them with nourishment. Other than that, we aren't told anything else. We couldn't tell you how to defeat the Reavers. They are projected to be the most superior fighting force in the known galaxy. They are capable of using lightsabers, the Force, and overwhelm you with teamwork. However there is no field testing currently to back their effectiveness. We know nothing of the Shadow Project...but we could guess that the Reaver and the Shadow Project are similar."
Gor 'Ak noticed that they appeared to be telling the truth. They were acting as if they had nothing to hide and were simply doing their job. Albeit their jobs might be questionable, but that's all they had business with.
While the questioning was going on, the Jedi seemed to relax a bit in formation and they were attentive to their surroundings. Most likely the Jedi were preparing to head towards Mur Eva with the go order. Aymaric, on the other hand, was going through the past events in his head with great thought. The holovid presentation he had seen was grim. Although the mask the Sith Lord wore in the video looked archaic and old, he couldn't identify it in the slightest.

While wrapping up his recording equipment in his belt, Gor turned to look first at the Wookie, then at everyone else.
"I don´t know her as a lot of you do, but let´s be real. She´s killed people in our squad already, and - no offense - seems more than a bit psychotic to me. And reviewing the material we just found doesn´t improve my opinion of her expected mental health. So she may not have fallen to the Dark Side or whatever it is you Jedi fear, but it seems not completely unlikely that she has lost her mind"
Unhooking the nozzle to his newly acquired flamethrower from his belt, Gor weighed it in his hand. it felt uncomfortable and unusual, but he suspected it would be his best defense against any psychotic Jedi.
"So let´s all just be clear that she might not be all that friendly, ok?"

Sergeant Vor'en's sensor pack started whirring with activity. There was an electronic signature and an anomaly signal coming in. His reading gave him the idea they were in the reception room and rapidly approaching them. It seemed the two signals were moving aggressively and that they would come through the doors that the kaminoans did. The Sergeant let the group know the exact details of the signal moving up on them. So, that would be to the rear of the formation about 68 meters. Qwy was on rear security so he angled his weapon out towards the door.

While the group was standing idle and talking amongst themselves the door at the end of the hallway opened quickly. A B1 series battle droid was standing at the end armed with a blaster rifle. The weapon was oriented right at the group.
A grenade is fired from the weapon and Qwy watches in horror as the projectile lands right in front of him.
Qwy: "GRENA...."
BOOM
Everyone in the group is knocked over and is groggy from the blast. Most of you hear a ringing in your ears that is intense. The image of the hallway ceiling lights begin to unblur as you regained your vision. Some of you look over to see Qwy in a pile, he was laying motionless.
Blaster fire was streaming from the end of the hallway and you all fought to quickly regain your bearings at the ambush.
Feldon: "I'm hit! MEDIC!!!"
Lues Van: "STAY DOWN, return fire!"
Everyone could hear the Jedi Knight's words echo through their head. His voice was a beacon that cut through the fog of war that permeated your consciousness. Realization of true danger begin to become clearer and clearer as you watched the blaster bolts fly overhead. The droid had gained the initiative over the group and was capitalizing. The soldiers in the group knew that they needed heavy volumes of fire returned instantly even after the well placed grenade that hit the whole group.
Sergeant Vor'en looked at the droid and knew he had cover in the doorway. The team was in the open in the hallway with nothing to get behind. Red Team was in a funnel of punishment. It would make sense that only two signatures from the sensor pack had caused this much damage. A low amount of targets could cause a lot of destruction if they got the upper hand. He had seen this before, two or three people raising more destruction than they should. In moments like this, Vor'en's gut kicked in. Keep your head down and shoot back. Two simple things that could be the hardest thing in your whole life at a time like this.
HEAD DOWN AND RETURN FIRE....it repeated itself in Vor's head. After this was completed, he knew to check the rear and flanks for a flank attack. Then he could check up on his team.

The sudden opening of the door alerted him and watched as the projectile smoted the member of the team...and knocked the Ewok back on his rear as he could no longer hear it seemed. "Ee Chee Wohma!" Ringing was all around his head as he slowly tries to get to his feet before hearing the voice in his head. Quickly he scurries to get behind Awne and Woro as he tries to shake away the annoying ringing sensation. He readies his vibrodagger and growls loudly before shouting loudly "No!

Lay down cover fire so sabers may have a chance to advance!! Hit them hard and don't let up!!" Switching to the light repeater, Vor'en braces and lets fly. As he is sending hot death the enemies way he tries to see where the direct fire to. "Sabers when you see an opening don't wait for orders go!!" "Woro see to Feldon as best you can! Somebody get to Qwy!"

Looking up he sees a droid at the end of the hallway and two crumpled bodies, scrambling to his feet he goes with his second instinct, getting the wounded to safety, he already knew he wasnt much help in battle but he could help by getting the fallen out of the way so the soldiers could take care of this. Running towards Feldon and Qwy he gets in the prone at the last second, "You need some help!" he screams at them not realizing how loud his voice was because of the insane ringing in his ears.

Before Gor had a chance to respond to Awne, the grenade exploded, and the Bothan was thrown to the ground. Instinctively rolling on his stomach and shielding his eyes, he still felt the impact of the shock. Steeling his mind into focus, he opened his eyes at the sound of blasterfire and screaming, and saw just what amount of mess they were in. Realizing the tactical disadvantage he and his friends were at, and the need for massive counterattack, the Bothan got hold of a grenade from his belt, and hurled the small sphere towards the droids position, crying to be heard over the noise.

Feldon was not one who generally asked for help--he must be hurt bad, was the wookiee's thoughts. He rose, keeping his head low, about the same time that Vor's voice buzzed in his head telling him to go to help the Jedi. "Way ahead of you," he thought, trying to get to his friend.

The blaster fire continued down the hallway as Red Team snapped into action. Suddenly, the blaster fire ceased. The lull in the action let you hear the droid preparing his grenade launcher.
Feldon: "INCOMING!!!"
Just then, a solid crunch is heard as the droid flies forward. His head popped off and skims across the smooth floor. It stopped just a few feet away from the downed selkath. There was a dark figure approaching the doorway. Stepping over the crumpled droid. Whatever it was, it had just lopped the droid's head off before it got another grenade off. The battle appeared to be over.

The giant stepped over the fallen droid his bulk barely fitting through the door. The respirator had been hastily repaired the stitches and dried blood clearly visible. His breathing was strong although a slight gurgle could be heard. As he entered the room Sarin brought his full mass to bear. He was immense, there were holes in his torso still slightly bleeding the dark ichor that was his blood from where the tubes had been torn. Sarin stretched his arms and shoulders back displaying his bionic mass. The life support of the giant pulled in a massive breath filling the corrupted lungs of the beast. "The force it seems will not let me die." The giants voice was a metallic rumble. "You have something that belongs to me." "I seek not to war with you only that what is mine be returned."

The fragmentation had ripped through his vital organs like flying razors through flimsiplast. The selkath, had tragically died to a grenade attack. He had been with the group since their discovery of the colony, and now he had passed away.
It was scary because no one really had time to get to know him. No one had time to mourn either. Possibly they had no way to notify his next of kin. What did they do with his body? Qwy had come and gone in the lives of Red Team like the sunset.

Only moments after the grenade left his hand, Gor heard the Jedi Masters cry, and quickly recognized his mistake.
*Crap, he´s right. There is volatile stuff out there*
In a reflexive, but futile effort, he reached forward to try and catch the hurled projectile. He was quite surprised indeed when the sphere suddenly halted in mid-flight, and returned back to his hand. After the initial shock moment, he thumbed the switch to disarm the explosive device. Still quite stunned by what had just happened he didn´t quite register what went on, he just called out towards the Jedi Master.

But, he needs to stay close to us because he likely has vital information. I also think we'll need help against what we're dealing with according to the holovids."
Kel-Yun observes the man closely.
Kel-Yun: "It's up to Sergeant Vor'en on whether or not he gets his weapon back. In my opinion we have two options with him. We either have to detain him...or we can use him as another combatant on our side. Like before, binders likely won't do much to him. So we have to "visually" detain him.

She watches her master move, at least he was alright but the other body wasn't moving an inch, a sure sign they had lost another. The farghul looks behind her to the Ewok her hand finding comfort with the hilt of her saber in her hand and then...
*he* walked in. A growl escapes her lips as she eyes the monster "not him again..." she mutters under her breath, force wouldn't let him die her tail; she'd put him in the ground herself if he crossed her again.
"You have something that belongs to me. I seek not to war with you only that what is mine be returned." Her growl returns louder now though calls out to him "You can't have it! it's mine now and therre's no way I'm giving it back to the likes of you!" She looks to the Ewok and the wookiee, moving forward though her tail was puffed and hackles raised, glaring at the monster that was once human.

The ewok regards the new being with a whimper but also a fierce look. He steps forward once, then decides to go next to Awne and continue to glare at this possible menace. "You go way now...Made Awne mad...Dont make Kaz'jee" he thumps his chest proudly "fight you..." Looking to Awne as she goes to her master to help him, he says to her quickly "No worry. Kaz'jee protect you." The fact that the Ewok had nearly confronted the behemoth of a man would most likely be proved an error...one he would gladly die for. This was his family now and he would gladly sacrifice himself for them...though hed rather not have that outcome.

The injured Jedi Knight crouched down next to Qwy.
Feldon: "May you become one with the Force. Thank you for aiding us. There is no death; only the Force."
The blonde Jedi seemed to meditate just a moment before getting back into the formation.
As the group was preparing to move out again, Lues and Kel-Yun were having a heated small-talk.
Lues: "You can't be serious Master. Sarin is a danger to us and our mission. You're going to throw everything away for him?"
Lorhas: "He's come to us seeking to better himself. Do you wish to turn him away and condemn him to the Dark Side for an eternity? Will you not give him a chance?"
Lues: "Master, your hunches are dangerous. You're going to get one of us killed."
Lorhas: "If it's security your worried about, I'll stay with him by myself. I would soon perish my physical body to condemn the spirit of another. I cannot stand by someone and let their destiny send them to an eternity of suffering. Not if I have anything to say about it."
The Jedi Knight was obviously not pleased with the Jedi Master's logic. He promptly turned to Sarin.
Lues Van: "You're coming with me. We're going to move about 50 meters on point. You'll stay ahead of me to soak up the all the threats. Don't force me to defend myself. We'll stay in eyesight of the others though."
Sarin and Lues went ahead of the group. They approached the large double doors at the end of the hallway.
With that, the last chapter of Qwy's life had been written. The discovery of Falsoor's shadowy activities had been brought to light. Now they were about to plummet into the heart of the obscure beast they had been fighting. A whole new chapter was about to be written for Red Team.

"If I had wanted to kill all of you I would have let that droid do it for me. "I sought the Jedi out because I believed you would not pass judgment on me so swiftly." "Was I wrong in that assumption?" Sarin stepped forward to Lues. The beast was over 8 feet tall and over 4 feet wide at the shoulders. The inhuman giant towered over the jedi. "If I am to fight with you I will require my blade." The metallic voice echoed through the room. "What could I possibly do to the whole of you?" "I was no match for Master Lorhas alone, how could I defeat all of you?" Sarin turned to face Lorhas through the horrifying mask waiting to hear the master's reply.

Awne growls lowly, her tail flicking "yourr blade was taken aparrt." she fishes into her pouch to hold of the crystal as proof "use yourr fists and the forrce if need be, We'd rratherr get out anyway with out too much morre bloodshed." She stashes the crystal quickly, she wanted to keep it afterall

Kaz'jee eyes the crystal with a curious purr of sorts before tugging on her tail gently. Even after she put it back in the bag, he sais softly in a whisper "Awne let Kaz'jee keep pretty rock?" he looked up to her with his eyes in the most adorable look yet, but then turns to Sarin with a snarl "Taken part. No can have!"

The giant turned his gaze upon the young jedi. "If that is your wish, but you will find that your soul will not be so willing." "That Krystal is as corrupted as my body, even more so." "The dark side flows from it, keep it and you will find yourself down a path jedi can not tread." "Already I sense the taint upon your soul." Sarin returned his helmeted gaze back to the masters. "For her sake master jedi I must keep the Krystal." There was a sense of concern in the hideous metallic voice.

"No way! Sarin, Buddy! I thought you left us to go home!" Aymaric has a genuine expression of surprised glee. He quickly moves over to the massive giant, oblivious to the partial body of Qwy, to the small chunks of flesh still clinging to his clothing and the headless droid laying on the ground. Still smiling like he was talking to a long time friend he hadn't seen in years. "So what made you come back to us? If I'd known you were looking for me I would have left a note with those people back at the Cavern." He puts his hand up next to his mouth and whispers to Sarin." I think their smuggler or something." A look of concern crosses his face as he takes a breath and focuses on what he sees in front of him. "What happened to you? You look like you fought a Wampa!" He starts to remove his med kit. "Here take a seat. Let me get you fixed up."

The group seems to adhere to no particular formation as they walk and talk down the hall. Sergeant Vor'en knew that wasn't good business. Once Lues got to the sturdy door he observed the door control. He didn't seem to be paying much attention to Sarin, Awne, and Kaz who were debating over a crystal.
Lues: "Hmm, it requires a retina scan and a code cylinder. I think we'll need the body of Dr. Haliford. You wouldn't happen to know this area, would you Sarin?"
The Jedi Knight notices that the man was preoccupied with Awne and Kaz. He seems to quickly ignore them.
Lues: "Pay me no mind. Hey Gor! You want to go and grab Dr. Haliford? Take someone with you!"
Feldon hears Sarin speak of the dark-natured crystal and approaches his padawan. He looks at her cautiously.
Feldon: "Padawan, let me see that crystal."
The group was next to the locked door, clustering in conversation. Maybe this was a good time to clear up anything with Sarin before the door was opened.

He knew it, It was easy to tell force powers or not. "I agree with you about him but Lorhas seems to think it is necessary for some reason so I will go along with it doesn't mean I have to like it." Vor'en looks back at Sarin as he looks at Awne and Kaz. "Ok Sarin stay where I can see you no funny stuff. Everyone else form up and keep ready, no need in getting sloppy now.

Awne began to feel a strange sensation flaring up as she held the lightsaber crystal. Something wasn't right. The looming sense of Mur Eva through the Force began to be overshadowed by something else.
A low ominous ringing sound began resonating through the farghul's mind. She felt if she held the item much longer she might lose control of her senses. This sensation felt very similar to the one's she had experienced on the *Starshade*, it was also comparable to the ridge line where she had fought off the rabid humans by herself. It was definitely a dark foreboding.

Awne looks over to her master and frowns slightly, though it's one a child might give to a parent when their toy was to be taken away "but...but you have seen it masterr...and I'm strrong! I can contrrol it, I'd rratherr not trrust him with such pow...." she pauses as that odd sense of foreboding flowed through her; the sense of mur that she had begun to hold dear as she seemed the only one that she was contacting was fading and being replaced.
The fargul gulps and fishes the crystal out of her pouch, she didn't want to let it go but at the same time she did...she closes her eyes and shakily gives up the crystal to her master.

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-10-28 15:15:39)

The farghul went to hand the crystal over to her master. But, her muscles were paralyzed...She stood rigidly holding the crystal. The padawan's muscles were paralyzed...but she felt them contracting with tremendous power. As if there was an amazing amount of potential energy building up inside.
The crystal began to change shape in front of Awne's very eyes. It was forming the shape of a human eyeball. She was certain she was hallucinating! Her eyes were locked on the eyeball.
The rest of team simply saw Awne holding the crystal and not moving. Feldon was trying to get her attention but the farghul could hear nothing.
She heard nothing, but this changed into the sound of a hundred whispers. This went from a hundred to a thousand, then to a million. These voices were all in pain. What was happening to her?
Gor and Squirts brought the body of the doctor back. They quickly noticed the strange scene with Awne and Feldon.

She wanted to let go, she really did but her hand..
..no..
*No let go! let go!* she yelled at herself
*Stop..stop! why arre you all in pain?? what can I do??*
"So much pain.." she didn't know if she was speaking aloud or not anymore, she couldn't tear her eyes from the eye, she couldn't let go and she couldn't hear anything but the voices...
Pain..
So much pain...she felt water to her eyes, was that real? was any of this? was she hallucinating again?

As Gor returns to the hallway with the doctors body heaved over his shoulder - he hoped the guy wouldn´t start to smell too soon - he sees the strange scene, Awne standing paralyzed, holding something in her hand. Cautious, he watches the Farghul as he moves towards Lues at the door. Something was wrong with that cat, and so far, that had never meant anything good. Seeing the Chiss move closer to her, he calls out a waring to the man.
"Careful there, blue-skin. She bites"

Awne continues to not move as she held the crystal. The eyeball she was holding took a peculiar turn as it started to turn red. There was actually blood pouring from the eyeball, similar to Rith's condition she had seen before. It reminded her of him. Like a stake driving through her brain. The millions of voices in agony continued to whisper to her.
The chiss went up to swat the crystal out of the farghul's hand. Awne's head snapped to Kardoon and she let out a feral roar. The padawan reached back with her free hand and unleashed the Force at the helpless chiss.
He was propelled like he had been struck from a torrent of hell. He traveled the entire length across the floor of the 94 meter hallway. Once he slid far enough his back hit the door. *Kardoon takes 4 damage.* Luckily, he didn't collide with anything on the trip toward the door or the damage would have been much worse. He noticed the fallen droid laying next to him.
Awne had dropped the crystal after her attack. Feldon did not touch the crystal but watched it carefully. Awne had returned to normal.
Feldon: "This crystal is definitely strong with the Dark Side. I've never seen that kind of reaction before. My presumption is that it's more Awne than the crystal though."
Lues whispered to Vor'en where no one but he could hear.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Lues: "Looks like Sarin and Kardoon aren't the only unstable individuals in this patrol you have to worry about."

Meanwhile, before the bothan had a chance to take the body up to the door, it mysteriously opened. A voice from the door control could be heard.

Kardoon coughs, laying flat on his back he weakly says "Wow i think i just found the fastest way to travel." rolling over with a groan he slowly gets to his feet and shakily stands brushing himself off and looks at the battle droid, most notably the grenade launcher still in its hand, "Eww purdy," and proceeds to pick it up, damn i'm getting way to many weapons he thinks to himself, but this should be alot easier to use than that blaster rifle, holding the launcher in one hand he begins to walk slowly back towards the group.

"See, this is exactly what I was talking about before. How are we supposed to be absolutely sure that your Jedi friend is still at her full senses, when we´ve all seen you lose it once and again? I don´t know what the heck is going on with you, but snap out of it, ok? I´m already worried about a bunch of homicidal Jedi clones running around here, don´t make me add one I was sure was on my side to the list"
Gor talked with a calm voice, but his blood was beginning to heat up with frustration. So he wasn´t attuned to the Force as the Jedi were, so perhaps he couldn´t understand what was happening to them. But he was getting sick of all their "acting weird when it suits us" routine. Were they really all that frail in the mind? Because as far as he knew, Jedi were supposed to be tough and capable, and most importantly, in control. So far, nearly half the Jedi crew on this mission had displayed less than stable minds. He wasn´t chancing though, and as he talked, he shifted his body slightly and casually let his left hand drop to near his belt where the nozzle of his flamethrower was stuffed. With a discreet motion, he slipped it free.

Kaz'jee had not let his eyes off the Crystal. He was scared of the actions that had happened and quickly tore his eyes away as the Chiss went on an air trip.

Awne gasps as the crystal was gone, finally able to regain herself she takes a step away from the crystal staring at it, she could hear again...and noticed the chiss wasn't nearby, odd that was but more troubling was Gor's words.
Look to him the farghul frowns "it..it wasn't my fault..I couldn't let go..it changed in my hand! I wanted to let go and couldn't the eye wouldn't let me and the voices werre scrreaming with so much pain they blocked everrything..then the blood..."

Woro check on Kardoon!" Moving closer to his friend. "Everything will be fine darlin. Feldon just wants to look at it. you want nothing to do with it anyway. This not you kid. Trust me no this." He tries to calm his voices as much as he can. Motioning with his free hand for everyone to stand down.

Sarin slowly walked his hulking mass over to the small ewok. Towering over the small creature the giant slowly held out his hand. "Perhaps it would be wise to return the crystal." "It is my burden to bear, my soul and body have already been torn asunder but they have been made anew to stand the power of that which you hold."

The situation seemed not to be escalating, but Gor kept his hand hanging at his side, ready to draw his weapon. It appeared that no one had spotted him readying it, so the element of surprise would be his. But he didn´t want that to happen at all. Looking at Vor'en trying to defuse the situation - strangely enough by raising his voice and generally radiating anger - he turned his gaze to Awne again.
"Are you telling me that you let a *crystal* control you? Force or no Force in the crystal, but I thought Jedi possessed some willpower. If you hear voices in your head, block them out, simple as that. They can only affect you if you let them, you can´t cast away the blame"
He motioned with his right hand towards the Ewok, and Sarin who had now approached him.
"As for that thing, let the small one keep it. It seems clearly obvious that you should not have it, and I´d dare a guess to say that it will affect any of you Jedi"

The giant realized that despite his helping the party, some would judge him regardless. The giant withdrew his offer and strode off toward Aymaric. "The Krystal is yours, along with the burden of carrying it." "You will know suffering with it the likes of which you have never experienced." His voice carried loudly as he walked away. With each step a loud thud shuddered through the floor. Sarin took a seat on a large crate to allow Aymaric to examine him. "I do not believe there is much you will be able to do for my tortured body, but i will allow you to look none the less."

Kaz'jee looks up to Gor and purrs but shakes his head to the man. "If Awne say not her fault then not her fault!" The Ewok was near tears at the confusion that was pouring through his mind and suddenly found himself in the shadow of the giant. "N..no. I not give to you...Scarey...and say mean things." He then has an idea and looks to the Jedi master. He seemed to be someone that the farghul had been trusting... "What Awne's master say?"
As the giant moves away he breaths a sigh of relief and quickly looks around with a soft whimper...slightly too scared to stand by Awne..he then rushes to Woro and shakes beside him, hoping for some comfort.

The Jedi Master points toward the door and moves over to Sergeant Vor'en.
Lorhas: "The way is clear, should we have Lues take us forward? My Jedi will watch over Awne and Sarin. If they present any more problems we will handle it ourselves."

While the discussion was still continuing, Woro makes his way to Kardoon per Vor's instructions. "Hold on," he growls to the Chiss. Woro clamps a furry paw onto the Chiss's shoulder and using the Force removes the pain and suffering from Kardoon, and accepts it on himself, easing the burden on the chiss.

Looking at his friend of whom he would gladly give his life to protect, but the Lorhas was right it was he could fix the force was needed for this. "Master Lorhas I don't want anything to happen to Awne. I need your word that she will get any help she needs, I have lost to many friends in my life I can't lose her." The feeling the old Sargent had where strange coming from a man like him that had fought own war or another all his life, but he truly cared for her and it mattered to him to have in his life. Shaking the idea out of his head for now and filing things like that where they belonged he get back to business. "Ok lets go. I will take point, I need everyone else two by two staggered.

Kardoon feels a miraculous sensation as his battered body is soothed. It felt like pure energy circulating through his blood and entire body. He felt much better. The chiss also feels more enlightened that the Force actually worked/existed. *Kardoon recovers 24 hp.*
Lues Van notices Sarin walking in the other direction from Red Team.
Lues: "Sarin! Where are you going?Uh..Sarge?!"
The Jedi Knight reluctantly follows after the cybernetic behemoth.
Sergeant Vor'en took point of the formation as everyone grouped up in two's. Once through the doorway, everyone steps on metal grated floor. You notice that this was another hallway. It was a large transparisteel tunnel leading to another section. Beyond the transparisteel was red Vjun rock.
Someone had carved right through this rock to lead to the next area. The grim rockiness surrounding you added to the feeling of mystery and darkness of the whole facility. Red Team quickly but cautiously proceeded to the door on the opposite side. This large door made a metallic churning noise as it unlocked itself. It hissed open and the group stepped into a massive room.
Immediately as you step in you see the room stretch out far to your left and right. It was an impressive size. So big that you could put two or three Star Destroyers in it. There was an amalgamation of equipment spread throughout the brownish drab area. It was an amazing collection of conveyor belts, computers, storage boxes, lab effects, man-sized capsules, inactive work droids, pipes, and cables. All of the workstations here look of older design but excellently maintained.
The room also had multiple levels and balconies overlooking the production floors. The metallic grated floor above you projected shadows on the equipment beneath it. So some areas were darker than others. You heard the hum of generators that made it difficult to hear. This would be the perfect place to ambush an unsuspecting patrol.
You could go straight, left, or right. It was also possible to go up any of the many stairwells. There was so much filling this room that you couldn't even see the other side of this place. A few dead bodies seemed to be laying about. They were wearing the silver uniforms similar to Dr. Haliford. Some were even Kaminoan.

Sarin steps into the Security armory and begins rummaging through lockers in search of any weapons he might could use. "Blue skin." The terrible voice called out like a metallic nightmare. "Help me search these blue skin, if you find a blade worthy of my size call to me." "Anything else we find is yours, but I must find something to defend myself with before these fools throw me to the rancors." Sarin's voice was harsh, but there were no sinister or threatening tones towards the chiss. The giant brought his immense strength to bear tearing through lockers and crates with inhuman ease. As the giant rummaged through the lockers he took a short pause and slightly turned his head towards Kardoon. With a slight nod the giant acknowledged the chiss.

Kardoon, Sarin, and Lues arrive in the armory. This room was quite a distance away from the others. It was in the opposite wing of the facility in which Red Team was located. The armory was a decent sized room and it had a sort of rectangular frame setup. Energy fields blocked two sectioned off areas for the weapons racks. For some reason, the fields had already been deactivated.
One dead guard lay dead next to a small pillar coming out of the ground near the front of the room. The short pillar was a computer console.
Lues Van: "Unfortunately we had to dispatch of that man as he tried to kill us just for walking in here. We took most of the weapons with us out of here."
Sarin walked into one of the sectioned areas in the back and picked a vibrobayonet off one of the racks.
Lues Van: "Hmph. I don't like you having a weapon. But if you're coming with us I suppose it'd be wrong if we left you defenseless. Either way, we both know I'll know you're going to try something before you do it. That will make the situation tolerable for me. However, I don't know if the others will be so forgiving..."

Red Team spread the formation out so there was pair of people on each flank. The bulk of the formation was next to Vor'en and both pairs were on the flanks. Vor'en advanced the formation ahead and prepared to patrol the length of the facility. Feldon and Awne were on right flank. Woroken and Kaz were on the left.
As they advanced through the maze of factory equipment, they moved through the shadow of the upper floor cautiously. Dead bodies were littered throughout the ground. The body count seemed to be in the upper fifties. The appearance of inactive droids seemed to be a bit odd. As if someone was in a hurry and just shut them all down. The droids were in positions like they cut out in the middle of their duties. One lifter droid had a dead kaminoan on top of it. It was probably taking the body somewhere for disposal.
All of the dead appeared to have lightsaber wounds or burn marks. Some of the lab stations had even taken damage.
While Awne and Feldon are walking on the right flank; they spot an interesting lab work station. There was a man-sized capsule with computers and laboratory items surrounding it. Pipes and tubes were coming from the upper level. The tubing was connected to the capsule.
There was a person in the liquidated capsule...and it was Mur Eva.

Lues Van: "What is this place Sergeant? Anyways, Sarin is armed. I'll take him up on point."
The Jedi Knight and Sarin walk forward past a blister of computer consoles. He was definitely keeping watchful eye over the man.

After healing the Chiss, Woro hung back from teh rest of the party as they entered the large production area. Healing through the Force was still relatively new to him, and it took a few seconds to shake off the feeling. The Chiss seemed well, though, as he took off directly after being healed.
The comm chirped before Woro began moving forward. By this time, he was not surprised to hear that two different groups apparently had detected Mur Eva. From what Lorhas told him, there might be numerous clones of Mur Eva in existence now. "Be careful, you both might be right," Woro growls over the comlink.

Sergeant Vor'en imagines that Code Blue meant Kardoon. So he sends the chiss over to the right flank with Feldon. Kardoon had been walking about quite a lot and was beginning to feel slightly winded.
Kardoon notices the capsule with Mur Eva in it. The setup was similar to that seen in the holovid. She was floating in fluid and seemed to be unresponsive.

Kardoon quickly skims over the computer equipment. It had the typical Falsoor logo about building a better galaxy and what not. He was locked out of the computer. But he took care to look at the equipment.
The capsule itself had a small ring around the bottom of it. These rings contained finger sized tubes that appeared to hold glowing fluid. These were likely being injected into Mur Eva. What the fluid did, he wasn't sure.
He was able to derive that Mur Eva was in some sort of nourishment bath. So she should be healthy, unless whatever it was being pumped into her went wrong. Kardoon got closer to look at Mur Eva herself and saw that the fluid started draining quickly out the bottom.
Feldon stepped back with caution.
Feldon: "Oh my..!"
The capsule's transparisteel cover popped loose and slid downwards. Mur Eva fell prone with the tubes still hooked into her.
Feldon cautiously approached her and tried to wake her. No response....he then checked her pulse.
Feldon: "She is dead. I don't think this is her. I still feel her presence elsewhere."
Kardoon went over to try to do something with the computer and noticed something odd. A black and silver hilt was protruding now from a panel that had just opened. It was extended as if it was meant to be taken.

Sarin, having returned to the group and being watched like a hawk as seemed to be custom with these people, headed forward of the rest. The lack of gratitude shown was angering him and made him want to be away from everyone as to cool his head... or what was left of it. The giant began scouting for more of the tubes Kardoon had come upon. The giant turned to Lues. "Allow me some quiet jedi, I do not like having people always looking over my shoulder." If that were possible he thought glancing at the small jedi walking beside him.

Kardoon definitely knew what this item was. It was a lightsaber. The Jedi had been using it since he had encountered them. Most likely this was intended for person in the capsule.
Sarin pushed further ahead of the group, but Lues stayed hot on his heels.
Lues Van: "You know I can't let you go off alone."
Sarin does notice a capsule though however. It was behind a bunch of worker arms and computers. The shadow from the top level made it slightly difficult to see. The capsule was empty. There was nobody in this one.
Lues caught up to Sarin.
Lues: "What's the hurry? What are you up to?"
The rest of the patrol saw Sarin and Lues get ahead of the group. The ranks were now definitely spread thin. Vor'en and the main group were not too far behind. Feldon and Awne were back far on the right flank. Woroken was staying on line with the main group. There was so much gadgetry here that everyone could easily lose sight of each other. Especially since the area was not too well illuminated.
The lack of cohesion was noticeable. This was an unorganized mob by the soldiers' experience.

Awne frowns as her master simply leads her on without explaining what had happened. She shakes her head and continues after him, better to stay with him she supposed like she was supposed to.
Walking after him she stays quite for the most part, trying to work out what had happened to her, the eye, the blood, and working on calming herself again. And then...
Mur...
Her eyes widen as the farghul rushes to the tank "Murr...." she knocks trying to get her attention but stops soon after as her master seems to note that the..fluid, was draining. Soon after she jumps back in surprise as the lid pops open and the body rolls out.
"She is dead. I don't think this is her. I still feel her presence elsewhere." Blue eyes look to her master, that was a relief she guessed, that at least Mur was still alive somewhere "Masterr....is therre anyway that we can betterr hone in to Murr's life forrce?

Kaz'jee had stayed behind with Woro instead, and stuck by his side as he had a paw in his pack, thumbing over the crystal. Every so often he would look up to his friend but would also remain silent as he was still sad without the Faghul. He understood now that it was to keep her safe, but why not simply destroy the crystal? An idea suddenly goes into his mind as he tugs on Worro's fur, not realizing where they were. "Big fuzzy destroy crystal so Awne be back with Kaz'jee?"

***Hallway outside the computer room. As everyone but Aymaric and Qwy are moving out.***
Aymaric had been getting his med kit set up to help out his good buddy Sarin when he paused to remember why Sarin needed help, and what the instraments in front of him were supposed to do. "That's funny, I can't remember wh...." As he is finishing his sentence he looks up at Sarin, only to find him no longer standing near the doorway. "Looking around with a quizzical expression he is a little startled to find the huge meat factory sitting on his opposite side. "Sneaky little...big bastard aren't you." His comment is most likely unheard since it is just a whisper and Sarin seems to be distracted by the others in the group. So he begins again to organize his eqiupment when he remembers a great joke that Sarin would appreciate. "So have you ever heard the one about the Jawa and the Mandalorian? So, a Jawa and Mandalorian Warrior fall madly in love, when..."Oh for the love of hard liquor!" Sarin had disappeared again. This time though he was nowhere to be found and neither was the rest of the group. "Nice of those Krayt nuts to tell me we were leaving!"
Getting his equipment together, he gets up and starts to walk in the direction of all the foot steps. He gives a friendly kick in the ribs of what is left of Qwy's body as he passes. "Hey fish face, you might want to get movin'. Those Republic guys don't seem to give a chuba's ass about us. And believe me when I say this, they probably have no problem getting us lost down here then leaving us when it's convenient" Witout another word to the remains of Qwy the Selkath, he moves on down the hallway to meet up with the others.
It was easy to follow the Republic's best. The sound of a rythmic hammer pounding on the floor and constant talking would have allowed Aymaric's long dead deaf grandmother to track them anywhere in this facility. He was in no hurry to catch the group, his pace was slow and casual. The taste of vomit still fresh in his mouth form a few moments ago when it spewed from his mouth surprisingly fast and violent, leaving physical evidence that Aymaric had wandered these halls. Pulling some water and a rations pack from his utility belt, he continues towards the sounds of bending steel and raspy metallic voices.

"I need you to secure me a saber Aymaric, if you go over to one of the tubes you will find a small computer terminal that will dispense a saber, hold on to that saber and bring it to me at a later time." The giants voice modulator toned the words to barely audible so no foul ears could hear. "I will gladly return the favor my ally, should the need arise." After communicating with Aymaric about the item. Sarin continued his search of the room. He continued searching for more tubes. Sarin then heads off towards a large door. "Come master Lues."

Aymaric looks up at the giant standing before him, the booming metallic voice pulling him away from his thoughts, thoughts he could no longer remember. Starting to give a response to the request he was given, the man of average height feels the need to take a step back so he can avoid addressing Sarin's chest muscles and look him in the face. "Sure thing bud. Just don't tell anyone where you got it alright? Those uptight Jedi would probably give me a stern look of extreme disappointment if they find out." Sarcasim was the school bus that drove this comment from Aymaric's mouth. And like a school bus his comment was obnoxiously bright.
Moving over to the location indicated, Aymaric removes the object sticking up from the computer console and holds it against his leg away from an wandering eyes. "Here ya go."

Sarin, Aymaric, and Lues had advanced only 20 feet to another capsule workstation before they heard the order to halt from Vor'en.
The medic seemed to be checking out the equipment, but alas he found nothing of use. Aymaric and Sarin seemed engaged in small talk awaiting the arrival of the rest of the team.
After about a minute the bulk of the group caught up with the point element. The flanks were still outboard attempting to head off any threats from the side. Vor'en cast a watchful eye to every person in his group and then back to the surroundings. The Sergeant knew that on a mission a leader always had information running through his mind. He could never truly rest until they were back behind friendly lines.
The point element gets pushed back ahead and the command element stays close behind them. They continue to watch over every nook and cranny of the humongous production zone. But most of the non-Force users felt that this place was much too big to effectively clear.
A gigantic brown/rusted door looms overhead as the group breaks past a blister of storage bins. This door was slightly bigger than a rancor. It seemed shut very securely.
A brisk walk is enough to bring the group standing at the door. Shortly after everyone arrived at the door the flanks came in. Everyone reported into each other what they saw. Most of the reports dealt with equipment, dead technicians, Mur Eva's, and droids. Other than that, the area was devoid of life.
Lues went to the door control and attempted to open it.
Lues Van: "Blast....it's been magnetically sealed."

Glancing to the Ewok she does her best to offer a warm smile even if the stress was starting to get to her. All the same she looks over the group, no one too worse for wear
The farghul sighs as she closed her eyes, took a deep breath and thought back to home, one of the few things that still worked it seemed to calm and focus her was her father.
She remembered he had once told his class that a person was only as good as the weapon they wielded, if one could harness their body to be a perfect weapon then adding another, a blaster, a vibrodagger, a blade, lightsaber, anything would make them more able to defend the ones that meant the most to them.
She sighs again, her mind calming as she remembered, and set her mind back to the task at hand.
Her lids open to allow blue eyes to scan to the chiss, watching him examine the door then move off with a raised brow and tail flick, what was he...a maintenance hatch? she looks to the Sargent for the orders before looking back to the chiss.

As he often did when "realigning" himself in the Force, Woroken's thoughts drifted to his childhood spent on Kashyyyk. Although strange to some, he recalled the way that Master Lorhas finally got Woro to understand the connection with Force, spurred on by his invisible friend from his cub years, Waltoren. Woroken was playing a game of hide and seek with his invisible friend, locating his friend through the use of the Force only. This game was always Woro's best way to center and prepare himself for whatever was next.

Awne looks over to her master, taking the time to center herself more and take a seat for a rest beside the Sargent, as she couldn't risk being near the crystal and thus had to stop herself from going to sit with the other two furry creatures.
Plopping down she sighs and rests her head on the wall "Everrything's fine Vorr...though the idea of a good meal is something I'm looking forrwarrd to as well." She looks over to him and grins "I'll even buy you a drrink when this is overr."

Kaz'jee watches as Woro looks to be relaxing and shifts uncomfortably while standing, before setting his pack down and walking over to Awne. True it was a smart thing to do...leaving his pack like that, but he -had- been instructed to NOT let Awne or the crystal near each other...and he was obeying that. Moving cautiously towards the farghul he sniffs the air before moving to sit next to her, purring all the while. "Kaz'jee know Awne not mean to hurt blue man..."

Kardoon easily stays afloat in the dark flooded maintenance tunnel. Once he gets his bearings he tries to get a better feel for his surroundings. The water was calm and it was eerily quiet in here.
He looked down and he could not see his feet. The chiss couldn't even see the ground. A drop of water was in his mouth only he noticed it didn't taste like water. It was some other fluid. *Knowledge tech as a reaction.* Obviously people had been dumping their garbage into this maintenance tunnel. But why?
Behind him he could see the light from the hatch, but there was no way back up. He would have to swim forward to make progress. He couldn't see anything though...and wasn't sure when the tunnel ended.

Kardoon wasn't too sure what it was he was swimming in. Though it did seem to have some water mixed in with it. He pressed on through the liquid and at a good pace. The chiss knew to use the junk to his advantage so he used them as buoys. After about 78 meters he arrived at rungs that were embedded into the wall. The rungs led up to a hatch.
The chiss climbed up the rungs a short distance and stopped at the hatch. He looked back down to see a body of a human floating in the murky liquid. The person was definitely dead. She was wearing the typical silver lab uniform. What was junk and bodies doing in here? He looked up back to the hatch and saw a turn wheel. It was likely what opened the hatch.

Kardoon turns the wheel and then slowly moves the plate up. He scanned the floor around him and saw nothing of interest. Once he had the immediate area cleared he made his way out of the passage.
This room was equally as large as the one before the maintenance tunnel. It was apparent there were multiple floors here and balconies to observe the work stations. There was one distinct difference though. Gray storage vats were lined down the walls in two parallel columns. The vats numbered six on each side. Their dimensions appeared to be that of two rancors tall and 10 feet wide. Whatever their purpose they could hold a large volume of substances. Pipes and tubing seemed to running from them throughout the area. The pipe network looked as if to lead to other areas as well.
Typical gadgetry and lab stations were speckled throughout the room, so there was noting different in that regard. Kardoon turned around to the magsealed door and approached the door control. Within seconds, the door was opened and he was face to face with Red Team again. The chiss was utterly soaked and beginning to feel a little chilly.

He opened his eyes and felt much more refreshed than before. He saw that Kardoon had been busy during his break. He also noticed Kaz sitting beside Awne. He made a mental note to check with the little ewok and ensure the dark crystal was still with him.

Sarin glared down at aymaric. placing the saber on his belt beneath his cloak. Holding up the arm Sarin opened and closed the giant claws raking them across each other for the intimidation factor. "It was a gift." The giant continued to stare at the arm, a sense of sorrow in his voice. Sarin's voice emitter let out a growl, and the giant placed the arm back under his cloak. The giant flexed his other arm, the part of his body least touched by the prosthesis that plagued his body. "Come friend." "Stand with me and I will show you true power." Aymaric, though he could not see his face, knew that the giant must have had a slight smile on his face. With that Sarin headed of through the door ahead of the group.

Once the claws retreated back to their home, Aymaric starts to continue his questioning while walking alongside Sarin, when the self-destruct message is announced. "Seriously!

Lues Van quickly moves over to Sergeant Vor'en. He gave a swift glance to the others to see if they were still pulling security. He takes a look at the map on the datapad closely.
Lues Van: "From what I can tell, she's forward of this particular area. On your map though, it seems it ends way before where her position should be."
The Jedi Knight points to the datapad and traces it to the end of this room, a lift, a walkway tunnel...and that's it. The Jedi Knight points 86 meters past the dead end. So overall they were looking at roughly a 264 meter movement if Lues was correct.
Lues Van: "She would be in that area. But it's not documented on this map. I'm certain she's there."
Now, Sergeant Vor'en was presented a difficult choice.

He hated trusting Leus's apparently faulty connection to the Force, but decided this was Leus's chance to prove himself. If his connection with the Force was wrong this time, assuming the Team gets out, alive, Woro swore to have that conversation with Leus.

Woroken searched through the Force. He was shocked at how brilliantly he felt Mur Eva's presence. Lues was right by his feelings. One might wonder why now all of a sudden it was so easy to detect his friend.
Vor'en had looked at the map. He was too pumped up with adrenaline to get an exact estimation, but he was sure they could easily get there in less than 10 minutes if they ran. He barked out the orders to the Jedi Master...and even he seemed to hesitate.
Lorhas: "Ok...I'll get everyone to safety."
The Jedi Master started heading back through the blast door with the others.
Vor'en and Lues took off in a run toward Kardoon's position. The blue humanoid was currently behind one of the colossal coolant tanks. The chiss was scouting ahead of his current position. Once this was clear, he took off running again with his friends in tow.
They bounded up to the next coolant tank that was on their left side. Once they were all in position, they spotted a tan lift door embedded in the wall at the end of the large room. It was forward and center of their position behind the coolant tank. It was about 16 meters away. Hopefully the lift was in working condition.
Kardoon also noticed a viewport that led into another room. It likely had something to do with office work or something related to workplace supervision. There didn't seem to be any organic activity in the area though.
*Ok, shew. A lot of moving parts guys so work with me. Who is running with Vor'en to Mur Eva and who is evacuating? If you are evacuating I will make a separate thread for you.

"I told you get out of here Woro. The four of us have got it covered. Now follow orders and get out before this place blows." Vor'en keeps his carbine at ready anything that pops out gets shot.

Despite Sergeant Vor'en telling the rest of the team to stay back, they were following him anyways. Once the group had stopped behind the final coolant tank the others were with him. Sarin was using the Force to augment his movement and he was like a running wrecking ball. He had thrown the ewok over his shoulder to help him keep up with the group.
Everyone noticed that Sarin and Kaz were at least 10 meters behind the group. If there was anyone in the area they would definitely hear them so they had lost the advantage of stealth. Maybe the sound of the alarm blaring would cancel out their noise.
The group rallied up quickly and went into the lift. It was a tight squeeze, but the everyone managed to get the group up in two trips.
*Alright, I'm moving the team out. Gor if you want to turn around and evacuate I'll say you did that. Otherwise I'll have you run with the majority right now. As it stands now, the group is 100 percent to Mur Eva.*

Once the second wave of Red Team gets off the lift, you all quickly take off down a lengthy but narrow tunnel. It was transparisteel and as each foot clanked the floor you couldn't help but notice the display on the outside. There appeared to be a lot of giant tubed columns holding up dozens of disk-shaped cloning tanks.They appeared to be empty of embryos. This tunnel was taking you right over the main cloning area and it was likely this is how you were able to watch over all the clones. You couldn't even tell how to get into that area. The tunnel was empty of life though.
As you got near the finish of the 100 meter long tunnel you see a dead end. It was nothing but rock wall. The group now had nowhere else to go.
Everyone stopped next to the wall, and it was apparent that everyone had become slightly winded.
Lues shouted in desperation.
Lues Van: "I know she's past here! We've got to find a way through!"

Aymaric and Kardoon simultaneously search for an opening on the rock wall. Surprisingly, they touch the rock and it vanishes completely. All that was left was a tan door. Apparently it was hologram technology to produce an illusion. The door opened with a hiss and the group proceeded into the next area.
This room was considerably small compared to the places they had been through on this facility. It appeared to be a personal quarters of some type. It was definitely big for a personal living space. It was empty of all life. Red Team's eyes were filled with the decor of red, black, and gold that lit up the room. It was obvious that these quarters were for someone with exquisite and expensive tastes. It was very out of place for an underground facility and looked as if it belonged in a high-class mansion. There was a soft tune playing in the background that was of a sad ballad.The room was brightly lit by a single lamp and it created a shadowy serenade when the atmosphere was complimented by the music.
Two human sized statues were on the flanks of the room.*Knowledge Galactic Lore to identify.* They were posing as if to pray. Their faces seemed to be in agony as if they were about to cry. At the back of the room, you can see a luxurious king-sized bed. It was draped with red and gold tassels. A black blanket was on the surface and was made neatly. If you were to lay in it you most assuredly would feel like you were drifting to sleep in another realm.
Along the walls were holopictures of certain creatures. Whoever lived here had a nice collection of friends. One picture in particular was completely surprising. It was a picture of a younger Master Lorhas.
There also was book shelves, they were lined with hardback flimsiplast books. The topics ranged from politics, ecology, galactic history, galactic civil war, Senator Palpatine, history of the Jedi and Sith order, Old Republic, economy, and trading. So this room was also likely used as a study. The books appeared to be written in High Galactic. It was also evident that there were a lot of books on Thule. One even seemed to be written in an ancient language, and it read ***Prophecy of the Domitoris.*** Tapestries of ancient origins lined the walls behind the shelves.
The other side of the room bore a fireplace that was no longer lit. There was a head mount over the fireplace and it appeared to be a Hssiss with exotic gems in place of its eyes. In a corner next to the fireplace, was a narrow door with a control panel next to it.
Kardoon saw something that caught his eye on a desk. There appeared to be a black shining helmet and a ring with a black stone.
All the Force-sensitives felt a ominous disturbance in the Force, and it was coming from the next area.

The helmet appeared to be of ancient design. There were two eyes that resembled the pattern of a Hssiss. The top part of the black shining helmet also resembled a Hssiss' head. It had a plate which could swivel to protect the face. For some reason, it would not budge when Kardoon tried to lift it.
However, when Awne walked past it, she felt an irresistible urge to pick it up. The farghul picked it up and donned it on her head.

Back near the fireplace, Kardoon pushed a button on the door control and it opened with a hiss. Just then, another warning prompt came over the sound system.

Her footing shifts to follow behind the chiss, watching him pick up a ring briefly but her eyes were on the helmet, so pretty it was...she always did love black and shiny things...it couldn't hurt...one little thing...she had to give up her pretty crystal so she deserved something nice to replace it! Yes, yes she was right in this. Padded hands move towards it, fur raising slightly as she watches the chiss go for it first, *no! it's mine!*; though it seemed, it was too heavy for him to move, heh, heavy or not she'd drag it if she had to.
Her hands continue, wrapping around the surfice of the helmet to just enjoy the texture first, bracing herself she lifts it...only to find it was lighter than a a bit of fur! *The chiss must be weak…* she reasons with herself, donning the helm with a faint satisfied purr.
A sigh makes her ear flick, turning helmed head toward the bothan with a blink of her eyes, he was just jealous.. She allows a faint grin to her lips but hides it quickly, she felt like her old self...she couldn't remember the last time that had happened, when she had taken bounties and used the money to buy necessity's and the rare treats but the most was when she would take a treat from a bounty ooh then she felt as though she were a queen with a special something that was hers alone. Again she felt like that, forgetting the nature of the Jedi and forsaking the things that were truly personal, no this was hers.
Best now to follow the chiss though as she moves after him, peering into the room to see what was drawing that feeling in the force.

Awne looked into the room but this was strange. She couldn't see anything with her eyes...it was completely dark to her. Normally she could see easily with low illumination but this was different. She couldn't even see Kardoon in front of her.
She reached out with the Force. Her link with the Force felt hazy. While she did sense that something was amiss, she could not place her finger on it. Something was wrong but it could be anything as far as she could tell. It was as if her senses could locate the problem but then they were thrown every which way.
Awne had been warned before that the Dark Side can obscure your senses. It could twist everything around you that you could feel through the Force. Although she wasn't sure it was the Dark Side, it seemed like it. If Mur Eva was in this room then that wasn't a good sign.

Woro walked through the illusion along with the rest of the team. Just as the blaring of the intercom went off again, warning of impending danger, he felt the cold chill of the Dark Side emanating from the next room. Before he went in, he saw the picture of his master hanging on the wall. "Master?" he questioned, not even finishing the sentence, merely pointing at the young Lorhas on the wall.

"Ok, If I get blown to hell because the galaxy decided to mess with me some more. Where is she?" Vor'en looks around the room.

Awne frowns slowly, she didn't like not being able to see...her eyes had never failed her before and the idea...the mere thought of being blind was terrifying, this was blindness to her, nothing her eyes could see, and the force couldn't give her anything.
What was going on? What to do...Her hands remove the helmet for a moment, holding it tight to her chest but still she looks around. She kneels at the foot of the door, her hand reaching out to the floor to feel, if her eyes failed, and the force failed it was time to go back to the other methods. She sniffs the air for any scents that would waft to her to help her 'see', if her hand touched the liquid she would cup it, bringing it to the light to view and smell.

The Jedi Master seems surprised as he looks at the picture of himself. He looks to see if anyone had noticed the picture. His eyes caught Woro and he heard growling come from the wookiee.
Lorhas: "I don't know Woro. I just don't know. I don't have any acquaintances here on Vjun."
The Jedi seemed like he was genuinely surprised by this. One could only imagine what could be running through his head.
Back in the darkened room, Awne and Kardoon pushed ahead cautiously through the drenched floor. Kardoon flicked his light on but to no avail. The light simply did not show up in front of him. It was producing a beam of light but he still couldn't see.
Once the rest of the team got into the room, a loud metallic slam could be heard. It was likely the door sealing itself behind them.
Now the room was completely dark. The sound of liquid sloshing was breaking the silence of the black room.
Feldon: "Where is this?!"
As if to answer Feldon, an extremely ominous voice let out a low, deep, and long scream. The agony in the sound was keen and the noise so loud that you had to cover your ears. Despite the fact that everyone was covering their ears, they could still hear the voice's horrific moan. It was as if you had just heard the voice of Oblivion itself... This was the sound of true evil. Red Team had just discovered something beyond their belief.

As Awne moved to towards where she thought the door was, something peculiar happened. The screaming stopped mercifully. Now, only silence permeated the air.
But a few seconds later, the area was illuminated suddenly. The sky appeared overhead, and it looked as if you were no longer underground. The sky went from blue to red. The overhead of the group was now just as crimson as blood. The area you were in was actually changing shape and dimension.
Beneath everyone there was a pool of blood that went up to your ankles. It was no doubt what you were walking in now. You could see the look upon the faces of your comrades with the red, eerie illumination. The group was surrounded by thousands of dead corpses. They all seemed to be impaled on spears, burnt, or hapless victims to a multitude of many other ways to perish. The blood had a white mist floating above it like a blanket.
The area looked like a battlefield from the depths of Hell. The corpses seemed to be that of New Republic, Imperial, Jedi, and some humanoid disfigured warriors. There were so many corpses that they even blocked your way. The only way that wasn't blocked was directly in front of you. This seemed to be a path of sorts. The area ahead of you was still dark enough where you couldn't see far.
The corpses began to talk. You couldn't really understand what they were saying, but they were definitely all engaged in a mantra of sorts. The dark chant was rising in volume, as if they were praying to a higher power.

Just before Aymaric's fingers touch the jewels in the Hssiss' eye sockets, the lights go out. He thinks to himself, *"Oh how convenient!"* He continues to grope for the gems when the lights come on again.
The horrific scene before him was a little more than he could take. The last thread of his sanity finally snaps just as the thousands of corpses start to chant. Stopping in front of a corpse that might have once been a pretty blonde girl, he starts to sway to the rhythym of the chant while repeating the words in an overly cheerful tone. "Chant! Chant!

Another sigh escapes her, only one way out, and she wasn't about to stay here any longer than she needed to. "Come on." she calls out to the others as she begins walking towards it.

A sharp slap to the back of his head pulls Aymaric out of his trance, only slightly though. Looking around at the scene again he turns his attentions back to the corpse in front of him. The girl with the blonde hair was no longer there. In front of him was a corpse which had a stake stabbed through it's back just below the ribs and driven straight up through the skull. Rotted and burned, the only indication of what it might have been was the distinctive shape and features of a Wookie skull.
Turning and watching Zerah wade through the blood, he muses out loud. "How did the room get so big? And why aren't these people dead? There wounds look horrifically painful."

Awne begin leading the way through the path enclosed by corpses. The bodies formed a wall of dead held up by spears. It was a guiding walkway to who knows where. Each step she took began to separate the mist near the ground. After a few steps, they were no longer wading in blood. It seemed they were now stepping on normal ground. As the fargul led the group, she felt a tinge in the Force.

**Mur Eva:***Yes, take your rightful place. Lead the way for others to follow…..this is….who you are. You can't deny this….*

The mantra was still gradually getting louder, and it seemed they were now walking up hill. Awne did see a silhouette at the end of this hill. It was shadowy and ominous...the figure was holding something up. She wasn't too sure what it was...but if she got clearer she'd see it. It was like a beacon of evil, calling out to the group over the collection of the dead.

Her feet begin walking again, calling over her shoulder "Therre's grround herre...and someone ahead.." so many strange things this night and a person in the dark seemed to fit the entire strangeness.

There was no response to Awne's question. The farghul might be amazed that even Feldon seemed to be losing a bit of his heart.
Feldon: "Wha.....what is it? What's ahead?"
His throat sounded dry and words empty from pure fear. Awne would likely not get any help from her master when it came to this place. She couldn't blame Feldon though. This was a breeding ground of the Dark Side. No amount of training could prepare you for this.
The only thing that it seemed like the team could do now was approach the figure on top of the hill.

Aymaric continued following Awne, strolling along like he didn't have a care in the world. With his hands clsped behind his back he whistles the melody of the chant. A few moments into the chant, Aymaric realizes how hard it is to quietly whistle a melodic chant. He is busy attempting to improve on his whistling when he notices the Dark Figure ahead. His whistling stops and he physically pauses. A blue figure and a few furry figures pass him before he starts to move again. Continuing to stroll as he had been, he keeps whisting the chant at a soft volume.

Merely strolling silently along, Gor watches in disgust at the piles of chanting corpses. If it wasn´t for the presence of the Jedi, he´d likely have burnt them all to crisps. As Aymaric started to follow in their hypnotic chant, his face darkened. he could usually put up with the odd behavior of the medic, but this time he had gone too far. Moving up behind the man, he whispered in a low voice, putting emphasis on every word by placing his hand on the mans shoulder.
"Seriously...knock it off or I´ll make sure you lie there on the ground to chant with them"
It was only then he noticed the dark figure ahead. He found it strange he had not noticed it before, but something about this place seemed to dull his senses. Whatever it was though, it was not stronger than his survival instincts, and he had decided early on that he would not die in a place like this. Softly sliding the Nightstinger of his back, he moved cautiously and carefully a bit to the side, seeking for cover. Kneeling, he readied the rifle and took a fix aim at the figure, trying to get a closer look through the rifle´s scope.

Woro and Lorhas were removed from their conversation by the loud scream. They fell in line with the team, following closely behind the group. As they walked through the gruesome scene, Woro could only gape silently. He has never been confronted with this much evil before. He was not often worried about things, but this place did give him some pause. He soldiered through, specifically noting that Awne saw something from the front.

Gor brings his rifle scope up to his eye but no matter how much he zooms in he still can't see. The figure was so dark that the magnification didn't matter. This wasn't right, something was blocking his ability to see correctly.
Sarin broke free from the rear of the group and pushed ahead. He ran up the hill as it rose in elevation. He arrived shortly at the shadowy figure and took in an odd sight.
The figure became illuminated to loom over Sarin and the others. It was a humanoid red-skinned creature holding a large cup. The cup was dripping blood and had a pile of guts laying in it as if it was an alcoholic drink on the rocks. There were two figures altogether...a big one and a small one.
The blood formed a small waterfall, and a medium sized humanoid was basking in the blood mist. The creature was completely shrouded by hood and cloak. Whoever it was held a white lightsaber. The white lightsaber seemed to symbolically cut the darkness around you. Who was this person atop the corpse ridden hill?

Gor blinked for a moment and wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead. So this thing had some some way to prevent him from seeing clearly? Well, anything that was humanoid and wore a cloak, would likely have something sensitive in the hood of the cloak. He raised his aim a bit, to catch the location where the beings head would be in the middle of the crosshair. He didn´t have any idea if this creature was friendly or not, but given the surrounding carnage, and the freaky cup it was holding, he was inclined to say no.
Keeping his sights trained, he waited.

As the group nears the two figures, the human figure with the lightsaber swiftly vanishes. Immediately after the cloaked figure blinks away the sky disappears and is replaced by a tall ceiling. The standard lighting of the facility can be seen overhead. The taller figure's shroud is melted and replaced by a tan statue. The depth perception you had of the statue is pushed back. So it appeared as if it actually moved back. This statue was holding a small purple-glowing pyramid, much in the similar fashion as the bloody cup. You were now in a large room of the facility and the red battlefield had disappeared like snow melting quickly.
The shadowy figure was replaced by a throne. The throne was elevated on a summit that raised slightly higher than the ground floor. There was a humanoid sitting on the throne, and he was wearing the ancient red mask seen in the holovids. On this summit, there was a person collapsed. This person was Jes Mur Eva. She was unconscious and appeared as if she had been through a lot of pain. But otherwise she was fine.
This room was narrow but lengthy. It had a whole ceremonial appearance to it with tall tapestries draped neatly down the room. In between the tapestries were ancient inscriptions in which you couldn't understand. It seemed to be a room that was designed to point you towards the summit. The ceiling was high above you and the lighting much brighter than the grotesque scene you just witnessed. Tan and well-designed balconies overlooked the summit approach. There was a red carpet leading to the throne and the group was quite a long distance from the summit itself. There were two doors in the corners behind the summit.
The figure from the throne stood.

This was getting freakier by the second. Gor kept his crouched position steady, even though the scenario had changed, and he maneuvered slowly and cautiously to keep himself as hidden as possible. He knew he should really get out his holorecorder to try and get all of this on holo. He knew he would be scorned on, because even cubs straight out of the academy knew such things. But well...he could take that, and he'd gladly update their training records...as long as he got back. Keeping his rifle steady, he dared a quick look around and caught sight of the strange statues and the purple pyramid.

Gor 'Ak was in a prone position, as it was the safest position he could get at the moment. The only place to get concealment was behind one of the tapestries that were lined up against the wall. While he was taking in the surroundings he went over some information in his head.
The item that the statue was holding in its hands was a holocron. It was known to bear Jedi or Sith lore in the form of holographic messages. They were known to be preserved throughout millieneums to save knowledge. It was essentially an artifact that held mystical properties. This particular type of holocron that he was witnessing was like nothing he had ever heard of.
The red mask that the figure was wearing resembled the face of the Sith species. There were four long prongs that came from the mask that resembled thick whiskers. The whiskers were in the place of eyebrows and right underneath the nose area. It formed an especially sinister look. It looked like a tentacle "beard" of sorts. This person likely wore this in worship of the particular species. They were still in existence, but no one really hears about them in this day and age.
The writings on the wall were difficult to disseminate. But, it likely had an ancient origin. He had a feeling it was the Sith language but he wasn't sure.
Just then, Sarin broke out in a sprint as fast as he could towards the summit. The Sith Lord stood to his full height and chuckled.

Strangely, Woro almost laughed considering the awkward circumstances of a dark sided user of the Force moving forward to fight a Sith. With luck, they could destroy each other.
Cognizant of the clock ticking down to destruction of the facility, Woro began slowly moving toward Mur Eva's position, preparing to attempt to save her if circumstances allowed it.

"GO SARIN!!! HIT HIM LOW! HIT HIM LOW!!" Aymaric was jumping up and down with glee. The scene before him seeming to be more of a holovid movie than real life. The veil of unreality starting lift as memories of the last few days started to trickle back into his conciousness.
He looks down and seems to notice for the first time, the bits of Qwy's body that still clung to his uniform. An image of a hallway, red mist and the legless body of the now dead Selkath. Falling to his knees in an attempt to evade unconciousness, more memories start to flood in. His once long beloved Rathoth, with golden hair and a beautiful smile, now a charred and ruined body in a heap on the floor with many other charred bodies. A swarm of people who he might have known once, trying to kill him, even as the unrelenting JEDI hacked off their limbs. The body of the Feeorin Theos and the human Hadru, rotting in a cantina. And finally the tortured holovid images of Mur Eva's mother run screaming through his head like an out of control Maglev train.
Looking up and fighting off his need to pass out, he spots the maker of all this evil, the man wearing his own death mask. Still on both knees, he pulls his blaster pistol out and aims, strongly wishing he had any real power to put into this one shot. With the words barley escaping his lips, "die slaggert" he fires.

Sarin charged toward the Sith Lord atop the summit. He made way down the long carpet to his oppositon. The Sith stood poised ready to intercept any attackers at the moment. He drew his lightsaber and ignited the crimson blade with a defiant motion.
Lord Strife: "Don't waste my time! There is only ONE among you that interests me!"
*It is now Vor'en's turn. The current dimensions of the battlefield have you 124 squares from Strife. Sarin is 114 squares away. Six balconies total are above you to the left and right. There are long tapestries in which you can get concealment from but they are right next to the walls on either side. The door you came in is behind you to the back left corner about 15 squares. The statue behind Strife could serve as cover if you got there. Mur Eva is currently down next to Strife's throne. It's pretty much a good stretch to actually get to the Sith Lord with no cover in between. Don't forget about the two doors in the corners behind the throne.*

Taking good care to line up his shot, Gor aimed straight for the center of the red mask. Something told him that it would take more than a single shot to take this guy down, but at least it would be a good estimate of his abilities. Taking care to avoid hitting any of his allies - well, some of them were questionable, but for the moment, they were allies - he squeezed the trigger of the Nightstinger, and let its invisible bolt fly.

Sergeant Vor'en sends a quick two shots toward the Sith Lord. The black cloaked man brought his crimson saber up and swiftly deflected each shot. The bolts hit the ground and wall harmlessly. He barked out orders to his men which seemed to bolster their fighting spirit. *Born leader active +1 to rolls within line of sight of Vor'en.

Kardoon watches the fight break loose and stands still. He was waiting cautiously to act.
Awne reaches up with the Force and let's out a quick burst toward Sarin. Sarin flinched at the Force pushing at his back but he resisted. The dark giant continued to barrel towards the Sith Lord anyways.
Gor 'Ak was laying down close to his teammates when the shooting had started. He sighted in the scope on the Sith Lord. He discharges a shot and the invisible bolt travels toward the target. The shot was straight, but it was merely stopped by Strife's lightsaber.
Aymaric reached for his pistol and pulled the trigger on the weapon. The weapon clicked and did not fire. Aymaric noticed that some shrapnel was in the action preventing the weapon to shoot. Perhaps he should check his equipment better next time. *Track your ammo Aymaric. It is a DC 10 (untrained) mechanics to get the weapon back up and will take two move actions.*

"Are you such a coward that you would strike at me from behind?" "If you do not believe yourself a coward then you will fight with me!" Sarin haulted his charge and turned to face the young jedi.

Jedi Master Lorhas walked forward of the group and was making it clear that he had something in mind. The Jedi didn't seem to care about the others shooting. He also made sure to speak over the others. He was talking calmly but firmly as he walked past Feldon, Awne, and Kardoon's droids. The older man walked smoothly down the red carpet.
Lorhas: "Lower your weapons! Sarin, stand down! Do not attack, lest we want to lose another life of our comrades needlessly. Mur Eva seems to be a hostage and we must tread carefully with this powerful individual. "
He shouted towards the Sith Lord.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "How can we get that young lady to come with us?"
The Sith Lord bellowed out with a laugh. He walked over to his throne to push a button, then turned to face the Jedi. The masked man's lightsaber still hummed with energy.
Darth Strife: "Believe me Master Jedi, I had no intention of holding this lady hostage. She came to Vjun seeking answers, and I gave it to her. This woman is now under my charge. But, now that we are in this situation I have one request...."

The shouting and confusion amongst the group settled down as Red Team was ordered to cease the attack. Lorhas raised his hand back at the team, as if to gesture he wanted everyone to stay steady.
The Sith Lord laughed at the challenge that Vor'en had issued.
Darth Strife: "While I'd take great pleasure in fighting you, my opponent is to be chosen by me. You know you all have caused a lot of problems for me. I've seen what you're up to over the security feeds. You only made it this far by my design. But, you can rest assured it won't make a difference in the grand scheme of things. Your actions today change little, regardless of what brought you here and what you have done to this place."
Darth Strife: "I'd venture to say that you all are likely just helping me. You have brought someone before me that is much to my liking. So, if you would... have the farghul confront me in the center of the room. It is time for her to take a test that could mean so much more than any of you could ever conceive."
The Sith Lord deactivated his saber and performed a Force Jump to the red carpet below his summit. He began walking closer to the group. The dark lord began speaking in a delirious and maniacal tone.
Darth Strife: "Come farghul!!! Let us battle to discover your strength! It could mean more than you could possibly imagine!! I doubt the Jedi walking with you have any idea of what's going on with you...."
Feldon looked over to Awne with a worried look.

Lorhas gives Awne some encouragement as she approaches the Dark Lord.
Lorhas: "Awne, deception and persuasion is his weapon. Don't give in to hate. If you succeed in this task... You will be a Jedi Knight...May the Force be with you."
The fargul and Sith Lord took the long walk down the carpet to square off with each other. Both of them had lightsabers in hand and the anticipation of battle was growing all around.
Darth Strife: "No interference from anybody."
Just then, battle droids began to occupy the six balconies over head. They were armed with blaster rifles and they had the whole room covered in seconds. There were roughly 6-8 droids in each balcony, ready to attack at any second.
Darth Strife: "If there is any interference, shoot the girl."
Droid leader: "Roger roger!"
Red Team observed the droids and most of them had rifles pointed at them. The Sith wanted to make sure the battle went on his terms and that they couldn't just take Mur Eva on a whim.

She had to admire her friend, really. Even when faced with the idea and certain death of himself he was still willing to take place.
She dearly loved her friends, just like family. The word of family even in her own mind still brought up an image of her father, and wondered briefly if she would ever manage to see him again. She shakes that thought, she didn't need to have Jedi training to know that those types of thoughts would only result in certain death.
Her eyes narrow at the sith as her feet shift to steady her weight and give her a better stance, her saber hand, the right, moves away from her body to ready before igniting and waiting. She was patient, and for the moment calm, she knew not to attack first, better to allow the other to make the first move, or wait for the right moment.

Standing up from his prone position, Gor realized that he didn´t have much to contribute here. He listened to the conversation between the others and the Sith Lord, and once again, he got his opinion reassured that Vor'en could certainly use some time off duty. The man was a nervous wreck, and Gor had to admire him for keeping himself somewhat sane all this time. Slinging the rifle back over his shoulder, the Bothan began to cautiously move to the side of the room, using the tapestries as cover to move back towards the door.
He halted a moment when he noticed a smaller regiment of battle droids appear on the balconies. This wasn´t good. Using the tapestries as cover, he continued back towards the door, trying to slip out unnoticed. He wasn´t about to die down here, that´s for sure. But he also had no intention of leaving his friends behind, but since he was obviously redundant here, he decided to seek out other options. As he moved, he clicked his comlink a couple of times, causing the comlink of Squirts to beep. Hopefully this would keep a few eyes from his direction for the seconds he needed to slip away. He could have clicked anyone, but he felt that the mercenary was most akin to himself, and not likely to react in the wrong way.

Gor falls back a bit to Red Team's end of the room and walks behind one of the large tapestries. The large cloth was like trying to go through a curtain in a play. It was slightly heavy and pushed him up against the cold stoned wall with inscriptions. So far, it seemed as if no one had noticed him getting behind them. The droids were probably looking at someone else and Strife was too far away to notice...or he simply didn't care. He peered past an opening at the end of the tapestry to see the door back to the personal quarters. He could likely sneak away if the door was unlocked.
Awne and Strife continued their urgent stride towards one another. Once Strife was about 35 meters from Awne, he ignited his crimson lightsaber. He held the lightsaber in front of him and began a meditative pose.
Darth Strife: "Forget your Jedi training and show me your true strength!"
An instant after Strife finished his sentence, he vanished. Awne couldn't see him. He suddenly reappeared behind Vor'en and jabbed him through his back with the red sword. The veteran Sergeant collapsed, dead. The Sith Lord vanished from sight after he kicked over the dead human.

She gasps in a breath, her heart starting back up as she looks from her friend to the sith and everything faded away.

As he was listening to the roars of rage from Vor'en, he lost sight of the Sith, and out of the side of his eye, saw him reappear behind Vor and stab at him.
Without any hesitation on his part, he began sprinting to Vor's side ready to attempt to revive the old sergeant. Upon getting to his side, he saw how dire the wounds were. He tore into his medical quipment looking for something to help his friend.

Awne focused with the Force and attempted to calm her mind. She had trained for years at the Jedi Academy and heard of Sith Lords before, but she was getting a taste firsthand of their power. The Force was working with her, but she felt constant obscurity while attempting to detect Strife. The Dark Lord was throwing his presence in every direction and there was no telling where he was at. He was immensely powerful with the Dark Side. Awne felt enlightened that this is the reason their senses had been dulled so long. Lues wasn't wrong this whole time.
The Sith commanded a control of the Force that was unreal. She realized why overcoming this foe would mean she was a true Jedi...this was a true test of her abilities. The farghul felt that if she survived to see another day, this test would never end.

Up to this point Aymaric had been out of his mind, and that's putting it mildly. He had wandering around a mental playground of distraction and self-preservation, subconciously ignoring the obvious horrors going on. But the sight of seeing a red light slice throught Sergeant Vor'en's chest brought him out of his screwed up state of mind and back to the reality before him.
Without a word he rushes straight to the old Veteran's side and starts to administer emergency medical aid. "Woro, use what you got to stabalize him! I'll use what I got!" Slamming his med pack on the ground he begins to work.
((Okay here goes! BRING THEM BACK (pg 54 of the FU CG) if need be. Improved revivify(pg 54 of the FU CG) so I can move and commence medical treatment if I don't need BTB. I think I can use them both together, right?))

The friends of Vor'en desperately tried to aid him just after he was struck down. They quickly open their medical equipment in an effort to treat his mortal wound. Woroken reached over to touch Vor'en but as he did something strange happened...The body of the soldier disappeared.
The men who were surrounding Vor'en quickly looked around. They spotted Vor'en standing up straight in his position before he had gotten struck down. It appeared as if nothing had happened to him. Once they saw Vor'en was ok they looked over to Awne.
Darth Strife was within arm's reach of Awne and closing with devastating speed. His lightsaber was drawn and about to strike Awne from behind. The individual was a black and red blur rushing at her. She had only an instant to turn around.
Darth Strife: "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

Sarin stood aside and watched as awne began to fight the sith. The real fight was about to begin and he would be witness to it. The giant looked up to the ledges where the droids were standing. He knew there was no way he could get to mur eva in time nor was there anyway to kill all the droids before they could take a shot.

*"Wonder what that was all about?"* Vor'en thinks to himself about everyone's reactions. He dismisses it as nothing he could figure out and consecrates on the battle. *"I hope she can take him. She is a hell of a fighter but this guy is pure killer and that is something to not be underestimated."* Vor'en looks around he sees Mur and the battle droids that are guarding her and keeping them from helping Awne end this bastard. He tries to keep his emotions in check but it hard for him to not help her. He watches the battle, trying to pick apart the Sith Lords fighting style trying to see the opening for her to strike.

Awne stepped back just a bit as she saw the Sith Lord advance on her with blinding speed. He brought his crimson lightsaber down overhead with a powerful first strike that initiated the duel. Awne's purple blade intercepted the sword before it could strike her in the head. She felt her wrists bend painfully as Strife was leaning his weight into the farghul. The sizzling lightsabers were dangerously close to Awne's face as she peered into the Sith's mask. She saw hate filled yellow eyes and grinning rotten teeth. He was bearing down on her with his weapon and hate in his eyes. She was face-to-face with the embodiment of the Dark Side.

The large wookiee was still on his knees, staring at the spot where Vor'en was, or more aptly, used to be. He looked around and saw Vor'en was healthy, and standing, as opposed to the probable corpse that Woro had been attempting to heal earlier.
He rose, observing that the Sith had taken advantage of Awne's distraction, landing a glancing blow to her with his saber. He slowly moved over to Lorhas, and said as quietly as he could muster, "Master, what are we going to do about this?" He glanced around at the whole scene, the battle as well as the droids surrounding them.

Certain he had no way to help Awne, Aymaric starts looking around for other options. Just as his eyes reach the throne he remembers and sees the girl lying next to it. She seemed hurt and in need of medical care.
"Woro, help me with the girl." He wispers into the comm, hoping the Darth didn't hear him. The evil in a black cloak hadn't said they couldn't help the Mur, they just couldn't interfere with his and Awne's fight "She maybe in serious medical need. " His cloudy mind was getting clearer and he no longer felt the way he had since Qwy died. He still couldn't remember anything since the Selkath was blown to pieces, but he knew this was not the time to tray and figure those minutes out.

Woro paused for a second, trying to remember the Sith's words. He could not recall the Sith saying they could not treat Mur Eva. As such, he followed Aymaric in Mur's direction. He sheathed his unignited saber so that his move would not be mistaken for aggression, and moved behind the young medic.

Gor 'Ak works on the door control and sees yet another "ERROR" message. He seemed to be getting blocked at each option he was taking. Fortunately, no one seemed to care that he was trying to get out anyways.
Lorhas looked over to his padawan as he was gathering courage with Aymaric. He spoke out while watching the duel unfold intently.
Lorhas: "Be patient...wait for our moment, this situation is fragile."
Woroken hears this but takes off with Aymaric anyways. They move ahead about 15 meters when they notice Strife barking commands to the battle droids on the balcony.
Strife: "No one gets past us! Make sure they stay near the front of the room!"
The Sith Lord said this as he was saber locked with Awne. The droid squad on the left balcony pointed their blaster rifles at Aymaric and Woroken.
Battle Droid Captain: "Back in line! No funny business! Watch those two, private!"
Battle droid private: "Roger, roger."
One droid in particular seemed to be watching Aymaric and Woroken intently. It seemed any advancement towards the fallen Jedi Knight would take careful movement indeed.
Vor'en watched the two fight and everything in the surrounding environment. The six balconies were divided neatly across the span of the room. This meant that the battle droids would have the advantage if anyone charged towards Mur Eva, not to mention the Dark Lord would be in the path directly. The Sergeant gave words of encouragement to the farghul who was in the fight of her life. *Squad Assault activated.*

"Stand down Aymaric. Master Lorhas is right we have to play this one carefully." He watches the battle unfold she seem to be holding her own for now. With the droids set up the way they where it would be a shooting gallery they would be taking fire from above as well. Thee plus side if they all advanced at once the enemy would be caught in the cross fire as well. Over the comm link. "Gor, where you at? i might have an idea of how to get out of this but I am going to need everyone to help."

The soldier observed the situation carefully. While Lord Strife appeared to be a formidable close-quarters warrior, Vor'en guessed he knew some Force tricks like his Jedi compatriots. He could break contact with Awne and probably do a good job of holding the line to Mur Eva if he wanted to. That is, if Darth Strife really felt like guarding Mur Eva himself.
Then there were the droids. The Sergeant had seen these old Baktoid droids before and he knew they were quantity over quality. They wouldn't be a problem otherwise but they had the tactical advantage by being positioned in the balconies. Vor'en knew that even one little kid with a good assault rifle could make the difference if the kid had an advantage.
If anyone had smokes he could use those to cover his movement to Mur Eva which would provide visual distraction to the others. But he estimated it wouldn't be effective on the Sith Lord. And getting to Mur Eva herself could generate more casualties and that was extreme considering it was just one person they were saving. If he was going to rush, the optimal time would be when the Sith Lord was either on his back or dead.
Although he seemed to be devising a plan, something lingered in the back of Vor's mind. Even the best laid plans sometimes don't survive contact with the enemy. And the plan usually only goes as good as the people executing it.

With a final angry look on the door controls, Gor decided it was time to slip back into the cover of the tapestries. He didn´t like the odds stacked against them, but he wasn´t out of ideas either. While brushing carefully behind the tapestries, he pulled out his comm.
"Just exploring a bit sarge. If you´re interested, the door behind us is firmly shut, and not likely to budge anytime soon. Just relax though, and things´ll be fine"
He had to say he was a bit surprised to hear Vor'ens voice, and as he looked, the sergeant was indeed standing up, seemingly unharmed. But he had stopped letting surprises startle him a long time ago, and merely accepted them. However, knowing how annoying they could be, he was a man that had a few surprises of his own. And fate had kindly enough handed him the proper tool for the job.
Moving cautiously to avoid being seen, he worked his way forward towards a sheltered point that allowed him a good vantage over the ensuing battle. He just hoped Awne could hold on long enough for him to help her.

Before he and Aymaric had gotten three steps towards Mur Eva, the Sith had called them out. Woro stopped in his tracks and moved back toward Mater Lorhas. "You were right," he said with a shrug, turning his attention back to Awne.
It appeared that unless Red Team wanted to run willy nilly into a head on fight, that they were at the Mercy of the Sith for the time being. "Come on Awne, you can do it," the wookiee bellowed, feeling otherwise powerless.

Gor 'Ak used the two tapestries behind Red Team and made his way to the back corner of the long room. This corner had a tapestry to use for concealment and it also was darker in this area. He was relatively close to the right side balcony now and could see the droids about 40 meters away. This particular area seemed out of the way but allowed him to watch the duel in the shadows. He had no cover, but he had good concealment.

Confident that he was out of sight, Gor knelt and took the Nightstinger of his back. He had always been fascunated by these weapons, and the invisible bolts they fired. He knew of many stories where they had been used in clever tactics, and perhaps this one would be added to the tale. Still in his kneeling position, he raised the rifle to his shoulder, and tried to focus his sight on the duel ahead of him. Once he had the combatants in sight, he took several moments to steady himself, align his aim with his breathing, and adjust to the movements of the duelists.
His plan was simple. Blast the lightsaber out of the hand of the Sith Lord, and hope that it gave Awne enough of an edge to win the duel. He had to careful though. Even with the invisible bolts of the Nightstinger, an untimed shot would still appear of of place, and his interference might be suspected, especially since that Sith Lord seemed to possess all sorts of weird powers. No, he had to time it perfectly, right after Awne had struck a blow. It was a difficult shot, but he was confident he could make it. His slicing attempts in this facility hadn´t been very successful so far, but his luck had to change sooner or later, right?
*((I´ll use my Surveillance talent to get a +1 attack bonus, and then I´ll Aim and Fire right after Awne makes an attack. I´ll spend a Destiny Point for a crit on the Sith Lords lightsaber, and I´ll spend a Force Point to increase the attack roll, in case he tries to deflect.
Attack should be 20+8+1+Force Point+any other applicable bonus, plus it is a critical hit and an automatic hit.
Damage should be (3d6+4)x2+any other applicable bonus.

Awne took her rear foot and planted it in the ground firmly behind her. She took her off-hand and reached back to explode with the Force. She used her other hand to hold Strife's lightsaber in the lock. He was using both arms to sap Awne's strength but she was holding him in place.
The Jedi apprentice used the Force to attempt to push the Dark Lord away. The blast of Force energy moved the Sith Lord slightly, but not enough to cause any real damage. The saber lock was broken, in any case. Suddenly, Awne felt a bolt of searing energy strike her forearm. She had been struck by a stray blaster bolt and she was in pain. She didn't see where the shot had come from. *Awne takes 42 damage. She moves -1 on the condition track.* *Gor, I didn't use your Force point because you missed. Just in case you're wondering why you missed Strife, he used a DP to have you miss. Then I figured you fired into a melee so there is a chance you can hit Awne and you beat her reflex.*
The Sith Lord didn't seem to notice the shot either.
Darth Strife: "What's wrong with you? You're not using your full potential..."
Kardoon watched the ensuing duel closely, but he was unable to pick out any weakness from the Dark Lord.

Awne observed as the Sith Lord quickly recovered from the failed Force maneuver. He feinted left and then high with his lightsaber. The man moved like an agile shadow about to extract vengeance upon the farghul. She watched the lightsaber closely and noticed that it did a spinning drop towards her shins with deadly speed. Awne twirled her lightsaber to cover her legs and felt the blade of her enemy clash hard as Strife lunged with a sweep attack. The parry was enough to stop the blade but it jolted her lightsaber hard and she felt her grip loosen on her hilt. Her paws felt the sting in her hand from stopping the massive blow. *Awne takes 19 damage.*
Darth Strife: "You can't last long like that. Is it true you've been held back for so long you don't know your own strength?"
After Awne reeled back from Strife's last swipe she dug her heels in the floor for anticipation of the next attack. This time Strife was coming around for a mid-level swing. Strife's lightsaber was humming with power and she flinched at the blade coming in for a direct hit. The farghul felt a surge of the Force flow through her reflexively and the next thing she knew she was choking the Dark Lord.

The Sith Lord was starting to be lifted slightly off the ground when he lashed out with anger. The grip was released on his throat and he reactivated his lightsaber.
Darth Strife: "Good! But your rage alone won't be enough to stop me! You must go further than anything you've ever known...or DIE! Break the limits in your mind! Forget the laws of all nature!"
Once he had both feet back on the ground he executed a front flip above Awne's head and swung at her neck. The farghul instinctively batted the attack away and prepared for him to land behind her. Once the Sith landed he went for a straight jab with his weapon. Awne swung her lightsaber in a right arc and knocked his attack away.

The Jedi apprentice does not back up anymore as the Sith Lord presses his momentum. She reaches back and swings to the Sith's right side. Strife blocks this swing and then uses the momentum from the block to channel a spinning overhead strike on Awne. The farghul holds her lightsaber diagonally in front of her and deflects the spinning swing. She shifts her blade vertically and stops the next two continuous attacks with some ease. The purple and crimson lightsabers were humming and hissing with each strike. The sounds of the weapons in action created a ballad of frantic energy that was mesmerizing to experience with the senses.
The comrades of Awne could not help be amazed at Awne's prowess with her lightsaber. Even though Strife was an incredible fighter; Awne was definitely putting up a fight. This duel was fierce and you could almost think it was too honorable to interfere in.

Awne uses the Force to attempt to move Darth Strife back. The Sith raises his lightsaber and leans into the burst of Force energy. He resists the attack and laughs uncontrollably.
Darth Strife: "Perhaps you are not the one...now DIE!!!!"
The Dark Lord takes two steps forward and winds up for a brutal swing. Awne catches the crimson blade as it was aimed for her neck. Lord Strife parries the block and deftly severs Awne's right arm. The arm dropped with her lightsaber in it.
Strife then follows up with a spinning stab and the crimson blade sinks deep into Awne's shoulder. The farghul crumples to her knees at the mortal blow. The Sith walks forward, sinking the lightsaber deeper and deeper.
Feldon: "Awne!!!!"
The Sith Lord holds his off-hand out to signal no interference from the group. The droids pointed their blaster rifles at Mur Eva in response.
Awne felt her life fading fast in front of her. She was about to die...
Darth Strife: "What a disappointment. I thought I had made a date with destiny...but you're nothing but an ordinary Jedi! How am I sup....Eh?"
Suddenly, the farghul looked up back towards Strife. She grabbed his lightsaber hilt and pushed the blade deeper into herself. Strife went to face to face with the farghul.
Strife: "Impossible! LET GO!"
Once the Dark's Lord neck was close enough, Awne reached forward and grabbed his neck with her paw. She sunk talons into his throat.
Strife: "Yeargh..........le...go..."
With a catastrophic burst of energy the farghul jumped straight ahead down the length of the hallway. The two combatants collided into the statue with the holocron with a massive crash. Rubble, dust, and stone enveloped the two people in an instant. The concussion blast from Awne's Force Jump had knocked Red Team over prone. It had also collapsed two of the droid balconies closest to you. The power also seemed to be out in the front portion of the room. So it was slightly darker over there.
Awne was the first to rise from the statue's rubble. The Sith Lord was next. Awne aggressively grabbed him by the throat and began levitating in the air. Everyone could hear the sound of the Force gathering around Awne. It was a ominous rumbling sound and it sounded as if it was going to explode.
Everyone seemed to notice Jes Mur Eva stirring next to the fallen statue. She was rubbing her head in pain.
Once Awne gathered enough Force, she unleashed an incredible Force attack that sent Strife through the wall behind his throne. The back blast of the Force Push sent the farghul flying back down the length of the room. She landed with a sliding fall relatively close to Sarin. The farghul appeared to be unconscious.
The droids looked around confused...and the ones that had fallen from the balconies were struggling to get upright again.

Kaz'jee quickly goes to the fallen Farghul and starts to lick her face with soft whines. "Awne up...Awne up...please...?" He looks around worriedly as he continues to lick her over and over. "People help!?"

While his mind had kind of adjusted to the fact that Awne had her moments of unexplainable outbursts of energy - as well as some deeply disturbing behavior - Gor drew in in his breath after that last one. Slinging the rifle back on his shoulder, he loosened the nozzle for his flamethrower. He decided that the droids probably wouldn´t fire without order from his master, so he decided the time for stealth was over. As he moved at a quicker pace towards the "throne" end of the room - it didn´t matter really if the doors were open or not, not that there was a hole on the wall - he pulled out his comlink.
"Squirts, check the back door, see if it´s still jammed. And get a hold of that holocron..the pyramid-shaped thing. I´m going to see what became of the big freaky guy"
When he got closer to the hole in the wall, Gor slowed down. It had been an impressive blast, but he´d be a fool to automatically assume it had killed the Sith. But still, he held some hope that perhaps there would be some control back there that could allow him to stop the self-destruct sequence, or at least open the doors to get them a clear way out of there.

After Woro pulls himself out of the rubble, he immediately beings searching for Awne's arm and saber, knowing there was a chance that Aymaric, Feldon, and he could perhaps reattach it. Also, he wanted hold onto Awne's saber, as it appears she was incurring another of her "episodes" and he thought it would be better to keep her weapon until things sorted themselves out.
That didn't stop him from being particularly impressed with his friend's battle prowess. Her Force abilities were unheard of to the wookiee. Even Master Lorhas was not as powerful as Awne has turned out to be.

Now was the chance Vor'en had been waiting for the battle was over clearly the Sith lord had picked the wrong person cause he was now a whole other world of pain. Getting himself off the ground he quickly takes aim at one of the droids still left standing. "Red Team on your feet! Take them now! Woro, Feldon see to Awne and Mur Master Lorhas help Sarin finish that bastard off! GO! GO!" With his last order given the pulls the trigger send two bolts heading toward his target.

Woroken goes over to Awne's arm, which was near Sarin. The farghul's lightsaber seemed to have the dish cut off. So the weapon was no longer functional. At a minimum, he could salvage Awne's arm if he felt like it.
The bothan took off in a sprint and heard the report from Squirts.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Squirts: "Back door's open. Nothing hostile in there."

</details>

Behind the throne, a voice cried out from the newly made hole. He climbed out slowly and activated his lightsaber.
Lord Strife: "Hehehe...I will honor our agreement...*cough*...for I have not fallen yet."
He saw the current status of Red Team. The Dark Lord also observed Gor 'Ak charging at him. The black robed man called out in caution.
Lord Strife: "I see my opponent is defeated... in that case... Droids!! KILL THEM ALL! SPARE THE FARGHUL..HAHAH...ACKGHH!!"
The brunette Jedi Knight, Jes Mur Eva, had grabbed the Sith Lord in a sleeper hold from behind. She reached around and began pulling his lightsaber to his throat. The Sith Lord fought the blade which was quickly inching to his neck.
Jes Mur Eva: "Everyone! Get out of here! This is all a trap! He will kill you all!!!"
*Vor'en, I noted your attack so I'm giving you +2 circumstance bonus on your initiative. Gor, you were not able to run the entire length of the room, but you were able to run 48 squares from your corner that you were in. That leaves you 64 squares to reach Mur Eva and Strife.

Halting flat at the appearance of the Sith Lord, Gor'ak instinctively raised his weapon, but lowered it again as the Jedi he knew as Mur Eva appeared and locked the Sith in a chokehold.
"No kidding lady, I´ve had that feeling ever since we walked in here. But since everyone is really concerned with getting you of here, would you mind killing him now, so we can get out of here?"
Not waiting for her answer he turned around and pulled up his comlink to answer Squirts.
"Roger that, run ahead and clear a path for us. I don´t care how you do it, open as many doors as you can, and we´ll follow. Now move!"
Moving as fast as he could, the Bothan didn´t so much look at the droids on his sides. This was the element of his companions, and he figured he´d better move ahead to make sure they had a clear path out. But there was one thing he had to do first. He looked over to the crashed statue where the holocron had been. Where had it gone? He was getting that thing with him out of here.

Watching the fight unfold, Aymaric had become detached from everything around him again, this time he noticed it and let it happen. The feelings of frustration, stress and anger all went away while he was in this state of mind. Like the last time he came out of the fogg in his mind, he felt like he was watching a holovid of the actions happening before him. He was cozzy and safe here, he liked it here.
The screen lifted again though with a big crash and flying droid bodies. His mind had cleared and he was almost instantly ready for action. A black streak, that could only be the small Bothan named Gor'ak, sped past Aymaric as his mind worked to come up with a plan of action. The droids were too far away to effectivley engage with the grenades he wanted to use, and the Darth was being handled. So Aymaric decided to follow Gor'ak to the bak of the hall.

Aymaric started running past his friends in Red Team and was attempting to catch up to Gor 'Ak. He'd have to run much faster because Gor was closing on the throne area quickly. The droids who were recovering from the balcony fall still seemed to be gathering their bearings. The confusion was beginning to erode as their master had just commanded them.

Knowing he was a sitting duck for the droids, after stowing Awne's arm and saber, the wookiee began moving quickly towards the direction of the exit. "We have to get out of here now, everyone...this place is ready to blow," Woro said, knowing that the safety of the team and Mur Eva was paramount.

Woroken grabs the arm which was laying close to Sarin and throws it in his Republic-issue back pack. He began trotting back down towards Red Team and walked his way through their ranks. He was trying to keep his head down at the exchanging blaster fire between the two groups. The wookiee's eyes were fixated on the door that led back to the expensive personal quarters. That was the way out, after all.

Wow that Bothan was fast! Aymaric ran after him as fast as he could, surprised that he was going so slow. He was also surprised that anyone was firing at the droids. They didn't have time or the numbers to take down that many droids, obviously someone wanted to die here. "Come on, we don't have time for this!"

Kardoon drops prone and points his E-5 grenade launcher carefully at a cluster of droids on the balcony in the middle of the room. Once he has a good feeling he squeezes the trigger. The E-5 bucks in his shoulder with recoil and he watches as the balcony explodes in fragmentation. Dust, duracrete, and robotic parts went scattering everywhere at the impact of the explosive. Once the dust settled, you could see no more battle droids standing in that balcony. The left side of the tan duracrete balcony also seemed to have been chipped away. The tough balcony was still stable enough to support weight though.
Blaster fire was now shooting left, right, and overhead at Red Team. They were in a full-fledged firefight.

Sergeant Vor'en was getting orders out to his squad. He was so fervent in this he almost didn't have time to get his rifle up. Once he raised his weapon he pulled the trigger at the battle droids occupying the balcony to the middle portion of the room. Once he did this, not a single blaster bolt was shot. Perhaps he wasn't taking as much care of the weapon as he had thought.
Maybe his trusty E-11 wasn't as reliable as one might think.

The ewok broke free from the formation of the team under fire. He darted to his friend Awne with a sense of urgency. In just a few seconds, he would be next to her. Indeed, she had likely suffered heavy injuries from the fight with the Dark Lord. The ewok was certainly brave, he had no qualms running into the brunt of the firefight with the battle droids.
Behind the throne, Darth Strife and Mur Eva continued to struggle in their test of strength. The Jedi Knight was attempting to pull Strife's own weapon into his throat. Jes continued to tell the group to leave the area as it was hopeless to save her.

Already moving on his feet, Gor registered as much as possible of what was going on around him. He couldn't understand why people were still fighting instead of running. Even if one wanted to fight, running for cover would still be advantageous. And considering the clock was ticking, it made even less sense to stick around. He could understand a bit though, for those who knew Mur Eva, it had to be hard to leave her behind. But as far as he was concerned, she had made her choice, and that choice was to sacrifice herself to let them get away. He respected that, and even though he had urged her to finish her business quickly and come with them, he wasn´t foolish enough to stick around too long.
"What are you doing you morons? Get out of here!"
He kept his sights locked at the place where the statue and the holocron had been located before. OK, so he wouldn´t go straight out, but he´d just pick up the thing and run. He hoped Squirts was able to at least secure a few meters outside the doors. He´d hate to have to fight his way out.

Gor continued his sprint down the long red carpet. He noted that some of the droids were watching him as he was darting towards Mur Eva's direction. He was moving so quickly that they hadn't shifted fire to him, they were shooting at the formation mass of Red Team.
*Gor you are now 36 squares from the statue rubble where the holocron is located.*

Jedi Master Lorhas looked over the prone chiss toward Sergeant Vor'en.
Lorhas: "The fog of war has set in, Sergeant! Cohesion is the key to victory in this battle!"
After laying down that advice for Vor'en, the Jedi sprinted quickly to the droids who had fallen from the balcony. His emerald lightsaber deflected any stray shots that came his way. He was approaching them with an intent to take down all the droid attackers in that area. Although Kel-Yun was a formidable warrior, who was he to tell Vor'en about the fog of war?
After Lorhas had approached the droids on the left side, Lues Van made his action against the droids on the right. He approached them at a swift speed. The droids blaster shots weren't hitting their target as he quickly closed distance on them. Once Lues was at a suitable distance, he lowered his lightsaber and channeled the Force. The Jedi Knight levitated a huge piece of the duracrete balcony and sent it soaring to the group of droids. The large tan block landed on top of the droids, crushing them all. Some pieces of droid equipment shot out from being slammed by the rock.
Lues Van: "Hah! Too easy!"
While the ewok advanced, Kaz could of been surprised as Feldon walked ahead of him. It seemed he was escorting him to Awne. Feldon was likely going to look over the farghul as well. The Jedi was deflecting any blaster shots that were aimed at the small creature.

Sarin started running with the power of the Force towards Mur Eva. On his run, his eyes caught the droids firing at the group. He quickly turned left and then made his approach to the ledge. Once he got underneath it, he swiftly jumped atop the 25 foot high balcony. The dark behemoth landed amongst the droids and they were confused for just a second at the bold maneuver.
Sarin shoulder checked the droids directly in front of him. All of the droids began firing wildly in extreme close quarters. Most of the bolts struck Sarin's plating from his armor. *Sarin takes 18 damage.*
Kardoon continued to look down the room as he lay down searching for any immediate threats. He flinched as a hail of blaster bolts came to his direction. It was likely in response to him blowing up the balcony full of droids. A blaster bolt struck his IG-86 security droid in the chest and it collapsed over on its back. The droid eyes powered down as Kardoon watched his companion fade from existence.
Gor 'Ak noticed that a lot of droids had taken particular interest in him. A torrent of blaster fire was landing all around him like powerful red rain. He was able to successfully evade as he had his focus set on the holocron.
*It is now Aymaric's turn.*

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-13 21:38:58)

Aymaric continues to follow after Gor 'Ak at a sprint. He ran past the droids and noticed that the Jedi appeared to be handling them. Hopefully, the majority of the team could keep the battle droids occupied while Gor and Aymaric headed to the throne section of the room.
The wookiee observes the battle unfolding quickly before him. The droids seemed to be shooting inaccurately but if they kept the rate of fire like this they were bound to take casualties either way. No one seemed to be heeding Mur Eva's request so the Jedi apprentice drew his lightsaber and activated it. He followed his master's lead to assist him taking down the droids. *Woroken is 32 squares away from the droids that fell from the crumbled balcony on the left. It is now Kardoon's turn.*

Kardoon took careful aim this time around as he looked down the iron sights of his E-5. He was comfortable in his prone position and had time to make well-aimed shots. The chiss put his focus on the rear right balcony. The droids there seemed to be shooting at the sprinting bothan.
He discharged an HE round and watched as the balcony erupted in debris. It was a definite hit, although he couldn't really see from here how many droids he got down. Once the dust settled he might be able to see a bit clearer.

Vor'en works on his weapon as quickly as he can trying to figure out what went wrong then something finally clicks in his head. He should have seen it before but for some reason he hadn't. Awne was laying a few meters away. "Blast it the weapon can wait." He tosses the weapon away and moves towards her quickly drawing his side arm. "Hang on darlin' I am coming. Just hang in there girl you hear me? Not going to let you die on me now." As he moves over to her he begins to check over her condition. "Feldon I am going to need you over here. Kardoon keep there heads down. Lets get rid of these droids and get out of here. We need to get Mur out as well. Hopefully Gor is securing the way out. Sarin get to Mur. Kill that bastard and getout of here." Turning his attention back to Awne, he pulls out a med pack and uses what little he know to save her life.

Vor'en tossed his carbine down and advanced towards Awne's position. He instructed Feldon what to do and the Jedi Knight responded. *You are now 16 squares away from Awne, Vor.*
Feldon: "I'm ahead of you on that Vor!"
The Jedi was deflecting blaster shots so they would not hit Kaz. Once they had advanced enough, the ewok saw an opening to get to Awne's side. The furry one kneeled next to his fallen friend. She looked fine... minus the missing right arm. He shook her fervently and was hoping for a response. Miraculously, the farghul opened her eyes and looked over to her good friend. *Awne recovers 34 HP and moves one step on the condition track. The 34 HP does not count against your second wind. Awne now acts first in the beginning of the battle order.*
Despite the temporary respite, an intense fight was still going on behind the throne. Darth Strife was fighting for control of his lightsaber as it was being inched toward his neck. He shook the lightsaber loose and it clattered to the smooth floor, deactivating itself. Mur Eva then wrapped her arm around his throat, attempting to choke him out from behind. The Jedi's legs wrapped around his mid section to restrain his movement. The Jedi Knight saw the approaching bothan and she screamed out in warning.
Mur Eva: "Don't come any closer! I don't know how long I can restrain him!"

Gor persisted as he ran briskly to the statue rubble. He certainly had courage to continue through this amount of blaster fire. Of course, the battle droids didn't seem to be very accurate either. As he approached, he saw Strife and Mur Eva fighting more clearly. The bothan seemed to notice that Strife would likely come out on top. He appeared to be much more skilled than Mur Eva. The female Jedi also looked to be injured.
Back near the crumbled balcony, Lorhas was locked in combat with the frantic battle droids. He executed a Force-assisted front flip and landed right in the middle of a group of 3 droids. The Jedi Master performed a whirlwind attack with his emerald lightsaber. All 3 droids were sliced in half at the torso. Once these three were down, he turned his attention to 4 droids close to him.
The ewok continued to monitor Awne. He noticed that Feldon was still guarding him and the farghul.
Feldon: "Awne, can you walk? Do you need assistance?"

Sarin assaulted the droids with his crimson lightsaber that he procured from the production area. The Baktoid battle droids fired in a futile manner to stop the hulking machine. Limbs, heads, and torsos were sliced with destructive precision as the behemoth muscled through the squad.
One droid fired a shot at Sarin's back and it was absorbed completely. The monster turned and swiped the droid off the balcony in two pieces. In mere seconds, all the droids were left laying in a scrap pile.

While the bothan neared the throne area, droids on the back corner balconies unleashed fire upon him. The bothan flinched as shots got so dangerously close that he could feel the heat off the blaster bolts. *Gor takes 13 damage.*
Meanwhile, the skirmish closest to Red Team took a turn towards their favor. The droids next to master Lorhas shot an automatic stream of bolts at him. The Jedi skillfully angled a shot back at the lead shooter. The bolt reflected and pinpointed the droid in the head. Kel-Yun then easily dispatched the rest of them with a three stroke attack.
Lorhas: "This side is clear!"

She looks to it and whimpers though she calms slowly, gritting her teeth as she uses her left arm to help her to sit up, looking to the Ewok first then her master, having to take longer to focus her blurry eyes.
Shaking her head to focus better she nods to her master "I...I can walk..I think." she winces as she shifts to her knees, rocking slightly in unsteady balance, her tail moving quickly to stabilize herself and stands, having to use the Ewok for help and to lean on.
She looks around slowly to what was happening, she felt so tired, and the pain....
She looks around "Get....get murr....someone get herr..."

Aymaric continued to follows Gor's footsteps as he had one thing in mind. The blaster fire seemed to not be anywhere near him. The droids were falling and Red Team was doing an efficient job at taking them down. However, it did not mean the battle was over yet.
*Aymaric you are 52 squares from the throne.* 
Woroken saw that his master had defeated the droids closest to the front. So he turned and regrouped with the others who were around Awne. She was standing now and she appeared to be alright. The wookiee noticed that Aymaric and Gor were running towards the statue rubble.
*It is now Kardoon's turn.*

Looking at the balcony as it erupted in a cloud of smoke and debris Kardoon could see nothing, hopefully the damage he had just inflicted on the balcony extended to the droids that were there as well. Shifting his focus to the last balcony occupied by droids he racks the action of his grenade launcher feeling the bolt close on another lethal round he aims in and fires.

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-14 22:12:23)

The chiss cycled another HE round and carefully aligned his sights. He was so smooth with his last hit he simply slid his focus on the far left balcony. Once his front sight was in the center of the cluster of droids he squeezed the trigger..... *Thoomp!*
The last balcony erupted in dust and shrapnel with a punctuating boom. The blaster fire from the enemy seemed to have died down immensely...though there were still a few shots coming at them. Everyone's adrenaline seemed to be wearing thin as they were now deep in the fight.
*It is now Vor'en's turn.*

Vor'en keeps moving toward Awne, stopping when sees that Feldon is there with her. "Feldon if she can move get her out of here." Vor'en turns his attention to Mur and Stife. "Ok kid were getting you out of here." Drawing his side arm he takes aim for center mass on the sithlord. He was going to finish this as fast as he could.

Although Vor'en couldn't see the Dark Lord too well, he attempted to make an attack against him anyways. He unclipped his pistol from his holster and brought his weapon up toward the throne. He saw the shadowy figure still locked in combat with Mur Eva. He discharged a blaster bolt but observed that the shot went wide. The bolt impacted on the wall next to Strife. The shot was apparently more difficult than he estimated.
*It is now Kaz's turn.*

Kaz'jee looks to everyone then back to Awne with a growl at her missing arm. Rage now fueled the Ewok as he looks to Woro...and sees a boom thingy. With a swift growl, he grabs one off of the wookie and lobs it towards the fray, not sure if he even did it right. He pryas that he doesnt end up killing the group, or himself but was tired of running and being helpless. "For Awne!" he yells as he looses the object towards the droids.
*Base attack +5, and if I could id use a prayer point…but theres no such things*

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-15 17:16:32)

The ewok promptly grabbed a frag grenade off of Woro's belt and threw it after pulling the pin. The weak toss reminded you of a small girl trying to throw a shockball down a field. The grenade landed a few meters ahead of Feldon and he promptly dodged the incoming blast by covering his head. A plume of fragmentation dust kicked up with a dull thud of the explosion bouncing off smooth duracrete. The ewok likely had no experience with grenades as his culture only used the simplest of tools.
Feldon: "By the Force! Disarm that ewok of grenades, immediately! Explosives are not like stones to be thrown wildly!"
*LMAO!*

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-15 17:33:37)

Near the hole Awne had carved in the wall, Mur Eva continued to slip her arms deeper around Strife's neck. The female let out an eloquent statement that was becoming of a Jedi.
Mur Eva: "Dark Lord, Surrender! You have no place in this galaxy as proven time and time again!"
Darth Strife: *cough* "The Jedi have failed to maintain true peace since time immemorial! Now, unhand me woman! I have my attention set on a greater asset than you!"
The robed figure placed his hands on Mur Eva's arm and then exploded with the Force. A wave of energy propelled Mur Eva back into the wall and she hit with a sickening thud. She slumped over in a defeated heap, visibly unconscious. However, you couldn't tell the severity of her injuries from where you were at. The Sith made sure Mur Eva was down then turned to face the rest of the group approaching him, his crimson lightsaber making a symbolic statement of power.
*It is now Gor's turn.*

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-15 18:43:14)

Gor spat as he ran, and thanked his luck that those battle droids aimed worse than Imperial Stormtroopers. Dodging and moving, he made his way towards the crushed throne and statue, where he knew the holocron was located. At some point he could smell burned fur, but since he felt no pain, he guessed he wasn´t quite done yet.
What did made him feel like the Galaxy was turning against him, was when he saw Mur Eva get blasted into a wall by the Sith Lord. With her out of the way, that big fellow would naturally come aiming for the rest of the group. As he stumbled into the rubble where the holocron was lying, he tried to make a quick assesment of its size, and how he could carry it, now that he could see it up close. He also tightened his grip on the nozzle to the flamethrower, expectant of the inevitable assault that was to come.
((Double Move to reach the rubble, and a Swift Action to catch a second wind. I think I still have it left for the day. I´m not sure, and I´m hoping I don´t have to find out, but can flamethrowers make attacks of opportunity? If necessary, +5 to hit, 4d6+5 Fire damage. And even though the chance is slim, don´t forget to take Unexpected Results into account!))

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-15 19:53:38)

Gor approached the large rubble pieces near the throne summit. There were pieces of statue limbs and various sizes of broken rock. Apparently, he could not see the holocron laying out in the open. He would have to search through the remains of the statue to find it. He took in a deep breath at the task that lay at hand.
Darth Strife: "What are you doing? Step away from there nuisance!"
Back near the mass of Red Team, Feldon looked back over to Vor'en and asked for instructions.
Feldon Azrik: "Most of the droids are down. What's our next move?"
Sergeant Vor'en: "I need you to get Awne out of here. Lorhas and Lues cover their egress! Kardoon and Gor lay down some cover fire!"
The Jedi Knight promptly deactivated his lightsaber and reached down to shoulder Awne up. He walked back towards the group toward the back exit. Lues and Lorhas went ahead of Feldon to protect their backsides.
*Gor 'Ak recovers 25 HP. The flamecaster is treated as a long weapon so you can't make AoO's with it. It is now Sarin's turn.*

Spitting back as he looked frantically for the holocron that must be buried somewhere in the rubble, Gor felt that he had now passed the point where he played it safe, and from now on, things would get wild.
"Stow it, space slug. Both you and I know what lies in this pile of rubble, and either you just back off, or I´ll burn it to ashes"

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-15 23:48:39)

Sarin looks around on the balcony to make sure there were any droids able to fight. They were all destroyed and unable to resist. The mechanical creature turned and leaped off the balcony. He landed on the smoothed duracrete floor with a thud. He looked left, then right, locked in thought determining which direction to head next.
While Gor was looking through the rubble and addressing the Sith Lord, he looked up to observe 1 droid on the left balcony and 2 on the right. The droids obviously had picked out Gor 'Ak as a target because he was so close. A shower of blaster bolts landed every direction around him. The bothan instinctively ducked down behind the knee-high rubble for some type of cover. He heard snaps of duracrete from the impacting bolts and it was enough to make his fur stand on end. *Gor takes 16 damage.*
*It is now Awne's turn.*

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-16 20:34:39)

The blonde Jedi Knight continues to escort Awne out of the combat zone. He gave her some words of reassurance as she was likely groggy at the moment. He had Awne's only arm draped over his shoulder to support her movement.
Feldon: "Come on....focus! One foot in front of the other. Take deep breaths!"
The wookiee stood ahead of the position where Awne had fallen, holding a defensive line with his other Jedi. Sergeant Vor'en had ordered to pull back and the wookiee was not going to second guess this. He took off in a sprint back towards the expensive room that had led this way.
The medic Aymaric had also heard this order. He stopped in place, indecisive whether to follow the bothan or retreat with his friends.
*Two move actions to get you near the door Awne. I spent a swift to have you recover. Ok Aymaric, I had you delay so you can move later at anytime. I'm trying to progress this combat as fast as possible and really the only thing people can do is move actions. It is now Kardoon's turn.*

Awne watches the fight continue viewing tiredly that the sith was again coming towards them. Bastard had taken her arm and here she was having trouble to just stand! She growls lowly, her ears folding back along her head as she glares at him, her eyes turning to the fallen Mur "Someone Get Murr our of herre!!" she calls to the group even as her master takes her arm around himself to help her move away from the fight. She didn't want to leave but she knew she was going to be of little use.

The chiss kept his weapon oriented toward the fight and stood up from his low position. He looked over toward Feldon, Woroken, and Awne who were headed to the extravagant personal quarters. He began stepping in their direction with intent to escape.
Indeed, the formation of Red Team seemed to be that of withdrawal.

A part of Vor'en was screaming at him to put that Sith spawn in a grave. Another part was yelling at him to save Mur, but anyway he sliced it, it would end badly. "Pull back Red Team! Gor get the hell out of there! We are getting out of here." Vor'en backs out with the rest of his team. Keeping his weapon ready to put a blaster bolt in Strife if he where to attack. "Master Lorhas, Feldon get her out of here. He wants her for some reason and I am not going to let him have her."
((OCC: Pulling the team out. Keeping between Strife and Awne. Move him how ever far he can to do that.))

Sergeant Vor'en moved up to support the two Jedi who had formed a defensive position. The two had their lightsabers and a serious look upon their face. Lorhas was watching Gor 'Ak intently.
Lorhas: "What does he have in mind Sergeant?"
The 3 men were now standing on line, ready to intercept anything that might get to Awne or the others withdrawing.

"No idea Master Lorhas. Hopefully not get himself killed." Vor'en keeps his focus mostly on the Sithlord. "Gor! Pull back! He is going to cut you down man!" Vor'en hopes that Gor will listen to reason.

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-17 14:32:12)

The brown-furred ewok observed that Awne was being escorted out by her Master. Kaz 'Jee then turned away from the blaster shots and began trotting toward the personal quarters as well. There was no doubt he would follow Awne and keep her safe as she was weakened by her injuries. He made sure to stay somewhat near Woroken and Feldon.
*Kaz, you are 28 squares from the exit.*
Meanwhile, Darth Strife had his attention provoked by the bothan who was threatening to destroy the holocron.
Darth Strife: "You pile of excrement. You cannot be serious?"
The Dark Lord lowered his lightsaber and the bothan began levitating off the ground. With the impact of a turbolaser turret, the bothan was shot into the wall by the Force behind the throne. The duracrete wall made a small hole where the bothan's body hit and he was knocked over. He felt tremendous pain in his shoulder, it felt like something had popped loose. *Gor takes 32 damage and is pushed once down the condition track. It is now your turn Gor…you are 5 squares from the rubble…4 from Strife and 7 from Mur Eva.*

Keeping watch over the Sithlord and making sure that he didn't cut off there escape, He saw something that he had hoped would not happen. One of his squad foolish enuf to get in the way of Strife, Gor was thrown from where he stood is body slammed against a wall like a child's toy discarded. "Gor!! You Son of a...." Vor'en raises his weapon he had to end this.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-18 18:04:11)

Speaking up to a Sith Lord might not have been the smartest thing he´d ever done, but the snappy comment had been as much on impulse and reflex as it had been intentional. Still that didn´t lessen the pain of getting slammed into a wall at high velocity. As he staggered to stand up straight, he definitely felt something was broken. Scratch that, *a lot* felt broken, and his shoulder wasn´t where it was supposed to be. Still he only wiped some blood of his upper lip and even managed a defiant smile.
"Go to hell"
Even as he pressed the trigger on the flamethrower, his feet started working. He was now in a place he didn´t want to be in. And that meant getting someplace else seemd like a good idea. Preferrably fast. Getting that holocron was scratched of the priority list, but he wasn´t going to leave the Sith completely victorious.
((Standard Action to attack with the flamethrower. +3 to hit, 3d6+5 Fire damage, 4/5 ammo left. I´m supposing the rubble and the holocron will be caught in the blast as well, but the target is the Sith.
Then a move action to get the hall out of there. I´ll spend a Destiny Point to act out of turn, and use that extra turn to take a Run action and move 24 squares towards the exit, preferrably ending in cover))

## Re: Re:Chapter 1 (Vjun)

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-18 18:35:57)

The bothan unleashes a hail of fire at the Sith Lord. Flame engulfs the throne, rubble, and the robed man. Unfortunately, the bothan could not see if he had actually hit the holocron as it was buried under duracrete rocks. The fire had nipped the top of the rubble and it was unlikely to have any effect. Darth Strife backed up a bit as the fire was directly in front of him. His arm had caught on fire and was spreading up his robes.
The bothan took off at a run to get as far away from the summit as he could. He heard the Sith boast behind him.
Darth Strife: "Leaving so soon?! You don't get to live today!"
*Strife spends his own Destiny point to act out of turn.*
Gor 'Ak felt himself being lifted off his feet about mid-way through his run. He was hurled back toward the wall near Strife.
He saw the wall coming at him at devastating speeds. He heard a vicious snap and instantly everything went black. The Dark Lord walked over to the bothan to check to see if he was dead.
*Gor takes 25 damage and is killed instantly as his threshold was beaten.*

Everything had been moving in slow motion. Awne losing her arm. Mur Eva being thrown against the wall, Gor being trown against the wall and Gor's flaming response at the Darth. Aymaric also felt like he was running through the sands of Vijun again, his feet seeming to mearly sink in the floor under his feet.
This slow motion world snapped into a hyper moving world when he saw Gor get slammed into the wall a second time and the medic heard what he knew could only be a broken bone. The placement of the Bothan's body as it hit the wall also told Aymaric where the bone had likely broken, he had little doubt that Gor was dead.
No turning back now. He had a friend who might be dead and the object of this whole mission lying on the floor qand she might be dead as weel. Plus this raving lunatic standing too close to Aymaric for him to know he could get away. So he decides. He decides to do what he had been trying to do all day. Kill the man in front of him.
Raising his snare rifle up, he takes a shot. Watching the net explode from the barrel and start to unwind as it twists through the air, he wishes he still had the grenade launcher he loaned the now dead Qwy.
((DW if I can use this as my last unused action and add in another for this combat round, then Aymaric will repeat his attacks. Basically firing twice. +12 Snare rifle(net Qualities)-2 for short distance penalty +2d6 from an FP.89/90 or 88/90))

Aymaric trained his rifle sights on the Sith Lord and fired true. The stun webbing propelled toward the robed figure accurately. The Sith Lord immediately turned to face the webbing and cut it in half with his red lightsaber. He had temporarily taken his focus from Gor 'Ak.

The Jedi Master spoke out over the commotion of Red Team.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "We must flee! If we stay we will suffer the same fate as our friend!"
Lues Van heard this and used the Force to propel him out of the area. The Jedi Knight did not hesitate to sprint out of the room back to the personal quarters. Shortly after, Jedi Master Kel-Yun followed behind him.
Feldon looked over to his comrades who were exiting the room. He continued to drag Awne out of harm's way. Awne's vision was fading in and out as she saw the partially welcoming view of the elegant personal quarters. The lavishly decorated king bed looked beautiful to her. One would think that if you had time to rest right now it would be extremely blissful.

Vor'en sees the Gor lash out at the Sithlord for the good it did him. As the flames reach out and make contact with its target he quickly jumps out of the way. Putting out the fire on his arm. The Sithlords hand strikes out and Gor is lifted off the ground and then thrown through the air like he was fired from a launcher , slamming into a wall and sliding down and to the floor motionless. His heart sank. "Sithspawn!!! I will end you for this !" Vor'en means every word. Weapon raised he prepares to fire.
As he hears the Jedi Master talk about banging out of the combat zone. Every fiber in his being screams for revenge, but reality of the situation hits him they are dead if they don't leave now. "Red Team Bang out!! Double time it now!!! Move! Move!"

Hearing the words of Lorhas, Aymaric yells at the backs of the 'mighty' jedi. "COWARDS! STAND AND FIGHT FOR YOUR FRIENDS YOU SPINLESS WASTES!" Rage at the cowardice of those who preach justice and self-sacrifice was building up inside Aymaric as he turned his attention back to the Sith and prepared to fire again.

Woro hears his Master call out the order to retreat, just as he sees the now lifeless body of the bothan crushed by the evil Sith. As much as he wanted revenge for his friend, he knew it would be fruitless to attack this powerful foe. He stood back while allowing Awne and Feldon to move out the exit before him. When they passed, Woro grabbed the ewok, knowing he was slower than the rest of the team, quickly following them as he threw the ewok over a shoulder. "Let's get out of here, Kaz'jee," he says as they head out.
It galled him to come this far, and leave Mur Eva behind, but he knew the team, or what was left of it, had no choice right now.

Sarin walked down the long red carpet a bit to get Aymaric's attention.
Sarin: "Aymaric!! We need to withdraw! This foe is too powerful for us!"
Strangely, one might not expect Sarin to willingly run away from a fight.
Aymaric heard these words from the cybernetic man and flinched to see a stream of blaster bolts shift towards him. The red streams impacted all around him, tearing the rug up next to his feet. The shots were coming from two separate droids in the balconies elevated behind the throne summit.
Back near the personal quarters, the chiss hollered toward the Jedi. He was attempting to get the Jedi to go after Mur Eva again. The Jedi's voice could be heard booming out from the doorway.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "I'm sorry! The mission is under Vor'en's command. He has ordered us to fall back!"

"I cannot sacrifice all of your lives just to save hers. It is my call, and I will have to live with it! Now lets save the lives we can. Move out!" The emotion in his voice is very apparent. It is killing him not to kill Strife and bring Mur home. Hearing Awne desperately trying to save her friend even through she is almost dead herself, all of it is weighting on him more then he would let anyone know. After he is done making sure everyone is moving he continues on evacuating the area.

Feldon: "Calm down Awne...Jes wanted us to get out of here. Don't you want to honor her request? Now save your strength...we've got a lot of ahead of us."
Feldon's attention switched to the wookiee as he finished his run into the lavish quarters.
Feldon: "Woroken, is everyone else coming?"
Across all the book shelves and toward the front door, some of you notice Squirts. He was guarding the door back towards the cloning tunnel with his rifle at the ready. The group seemed to be frantically regrouping in this area separate from the combat zone.

"Let's go," he barked in the Chiss's direction, knowing he couldn't understand the words, but hoped he might catch the tone. He shoved Kaz gently through the door toward the rest of the team. "Go check on Awne, Kaz. She could use a friendly face right now."

Near the summit, the Sith Lord had his back to the bothan who was crumpled against the wall. The Sith was scanning the lines of Red Team to watch for any threats. The fallen warrior was not dead....he had just make it look as such. The crafty bothan had feigned death to catch the Sith Lord off guard. Once he saw an opening, the bothan sprung to his feet and darted past the Sith Lord. He felt the intensity of the lightsaber hum past his side. He was able to dodge it completely though. The bothan pumped his legs to catch up to his friends who were fleeing.
*You are now 30 squares from the throne Gor. This does not affect your round this turn. You have 25 HP restored and back to -1 on the condition track. It is now Kardoon's turn.*

Kardoon breaks out in a sprint towards the door leading to the personal quarters. Once he arrives, he saw most of the team regrouping around Awne. The well-decorated room was a sight for sore eyes of sorts. But indeed, he was out of hostile danger for the time being.

Vor'en moves into the next room looking around to make sure everyone was accounted for. "Ok, lets keep moving people. We need to get of here. Feldon can she make it out of here? I am going to go on point, Master Lorhas take the rear, Lues with me. Keep moving stop for nothing. Kardoon do we still have the info that we got earlier? If we do make sure it is secured and with the holocorder that Gor has. Wounded aree in the middle. Move out people we need to double time it if possible." Vor'en heads off to check out what is ahead. He needed to to get them out and fast.

Sergeant Vor'en was standing somewhat in the center of the long room that lead to the throne summit. He turned his back to the threat of the Sith Lord and firing droids to sprint back to the quarters. His gear bounced and clattered as he watched his friends get to the personal quarters ahead of him.
*Vor'en, you are 12 squares from the personal quarters. It is now Kaz Jee's turn. Kaz, you are in the personal quarters with Woroken and the others.*

If you want to question my judgment further direct it to my inbox. I see no problem as the action essentially never happened because Gor took no damage and did not alter in any way what you had planned.*
Darth Strife who had recently been set on fire spouts out in anger.
Darth Strife: "You set me ablaze and threaten to destroy my property? You die now!"
The Sith quickly chased after the bothan with blinding speed. A discharge of electric energy ripped through Gor 'Ak as he was running away from the Dark Lord. The bothan froze in place as the pain channeled through his body.
*Free action to activate surge and move 24 squares. Standard action to activate Force Lightning 6 square ranged. UtF 36 beating Gor's reflex of 25. You take 37 damage and Gor is killed instantly.

Kaz'jee nods to Woro and hugs him tightly, well...hugs his leg. So now he moves to Awne and Feldon and looks up at the Farghul with a soft wimper of worry, his eyes not even daring to look at where her arm is missing. Softly he nudges her stomach in a playful gesture to try and cheer her up "Awne good fighter...crazy...but good fighter. Kaz'jee wish Kaz'jee fought as bravely." He was really trying hard to help, but what exactly did one small Ewok do to help such a brave soul get over the fact that her arm was gone?

Gor 'Ak feels the dark energy channel through his body. The sadistic Sith Lord seemed to be enjoying bringing the hapless bothan pain. Gor turned and got a good look at the ancient red mask. The tentacle-whisker mask was borderline ridiculous but still creepy. As if it was by inspiration, the bothan surged his legs forward and broke free from the Sith Lord's grasp. He sprinted wildly to where all his companions would be.
Dark Lord: "You will not stop me from getting my prize! It is my destiny!!! Hahaha!"

He knew Jedi could do unbelieveable things with their powers, but this, this was insane! The lightning coming from Strife's hand made Aymaric pause for a heartbeat, his mind not quite comprehending what he was seeing. Another heartbeat and his mind was having a decision conference. Run, don't run. Fight, don't fight. Stand in place and scream in crazy confusion or don't. A third heartbeat later and the panicking Medic's mind becomes clear. As he raises his weapon and points it at the on rushing Strife, he thinks to himself. "I hope that's not pee running down my leg!"

Aymaric brought his snare rifle up to his hip and discharged stun webbing toward the fiery Dark Lord. The shot was accurate and went true towards its target. However, the Sith brought his lightsaber up from a low position and cut the webbing in half so it bypassed him harmlessly.
Back in the quiet respite of the personal quarters, Awne stretched out to the Force. She felt something that was a steep reminder of what potential Gor 'Ak had.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*Gor 'Ak's presence was radiating in pain in the next room. Her keen sensitivity almost made it where she could see him through the book shelves and walls of the quarters. His spirit was crying out for aid.*

</details>

She looked to the other Jedi's faces. Their changing demeanor's made her believe they felt his presence too. All the Jedi were thinking the same thing, when Lorhas' words broke the quiet bond with the Force.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "I'll go rescue him. I want the rest of you out of here....as per order of Vor'en."
The Jedi Master looked over to his padawan, Woroken.
Lorhas: "Continue down this path laid down for you. And.... May the Force be with you."
The Jedi raised his emerald lightsaber with resolve and dashed out of the quarters. The boom from his Force power even knocked over some flimsiplast book from the shelves.
The Sith Lord continued to square off with Aymaric and Gor 'Ak. When suddenly the Jedi Master stopped a few feet away from the Sith.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "Dark Lord....Release them!! Or I shall strike you down where you stand! Everyone else...Flee!!!"
Returning to the living quarters, Feldon looked to Awne.
Feldon: "Don't worry about anything...continue to rest...take deep breaths. We have a long movement ahead of us."
The Jedi Knight started moving Awne toward the exit, bypassing the ewok who was giving her encouragement. Lues Van went past Squirts and left the room entirely toward the cloning tunnel.

Woro felt the pain of the Bothan from the next room, as did the remainder of the squad. Just as he made a move for the door, his Master cut him off, and accepted the challenge. From the tone of his Master's voice, it was clear he was not expecting a return to Red Team. The wookiee wanted to say many things, but all he could croak out was a "May the Force be with you, too," before Lorhas was on his way.
The wookiee paused to try and help collect Aymaric and Gor. He ran to the door and roared for them to get out of there. If Lorhas was to sacrifice himself, he wanted to collect his team.

Sarin ran as fast as he could to get to aymaric's side. Sarin grabbed aymaric and yanked the small man over his shoulder. They had to escape. "Come brother, leave the fool to his fate." "The force will decide whether his life is worth the risk." "Though I imagine that sith lord will make that decision a lot easier." Sarin grinned beneath his helmet. Things were getting interesting. Still the timer was counting down and they had to escape.

Sarin uses the Force and swiftly gets to Aymaric. The hulking man scoops up the medic and places him on his shoulder. Sarin noticed that the automatic blaster fire was now snapping all around him. The shots made Sarin and Aymaric grit their teeth at how dangerously close they were. The bolts were coming from the last two balconies past the the throne summit.
*Sarin takes a total of 29 damage from the shots. Aymaric takes 10. It is now Awne's turn.*

*Lorhas' spends a destiny point to act out of turn.*
The Jedi Master approached the Sith cautiously with his lightsaber raised. He tried to angle his body ahead of Gor and Aymaric. Each step the Jedi made was swift but defensive. He looked to Aymaric.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "It seems you haven't used the time Mur Eva bought you wisely. Please, get out of here."
He turned his attention back to Strife.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "How has your kind returned, Sith?"
Darth Strife: "I'm not telling you anything! Just know that destiny has arranged this day for me! I want that farghul! Don't stand in my way...Kel-Yun...I don't want to kill you...but I will if you leave me no choice."
The Jedi Master seemed shocked that the Sith called his name out.
Kel-Yun Lorhas: "She wants nothing to do with your kind...she doesn't seek the path of the Dark Side!"
Darth Strife: "This isn't about the Dark Side...this is about the Force....have at you!"
Kel-Yun quickly closes distance to the Sith with a rush and lunges at the Dark Lord with his green blade. The Sith stops this charge and the two become saber locked. The lightsabers sizzle with intensity as if to punctuate the tension of the fight.
*It is still Awne's turn.*

Even with exhaustion setting in and numbing the pain in her shoulder she could feel the soul wrenching pain from the Bothan, she wanted nothing more than to run back and save him and mur..mur...how could they have just left her?
Her thoughts were broken from her reverie by her masters words and the comfort from the Ewok at her leg. She offers the little furball a smile, her tail shifting tiredly to brush against him, seemed her tail would have to become her new arm. She frowns, she'd have to learn how to handle a light saber all over again but with the left hand...unless her master was able to give her arm back or help her find a replacement. All the same she moves with him, breathing deeply to help focus her mind and shake the lethargy.

The wookiee continued to stand by the door to collect the rest of his team. He watched Sarin scoop up Aymaric, and get blasted, but they both appeared to be okay. He yelled again for Gor to pick up the pace, so the team could get out of the building's impending blast radius. He tried his best to ignore the continued battle between Lorhas and the Sith, frightened as to what the final result might be.

The wookiee's howling permeated the air with a saddening tone. Now that the group was settling down from the fight, the realization could be setting in on some of them. They would possibly have to leave two friends behind. Whenever the room went quiet for a moment, the melancholy chiming would be heard. What was better in this time? The desperate wookiee cries...or the sad music?
Feldon looked to his padawan, who was in terrible condition. Apparently, Awne was overexerting herself in this situation.

He was doing what Vor'en wanted to do fight the enemy and save the others but it was not to be that way. "Gor come on run!" He yells. He Turns to make sure that he coming and to see if he needs help. "Everyone keep moving!" He keeps moving to the other room so that he can make sure that everyone makes it out.

Sergeant Vor'en finishes his stride into the personal quarters. Red Team seemed to be catching their breath and readying to move out. It would likely be a brisk run out of this room to the end of the facility.
The Sith Lord continued to be bothered by the flames that Gor 'Ak had put upon him. Strife then dropped to the floor and performed a roll to get the flames out. While he moved across the smooth floor, he promptly slid out of his robes. Lorhas saw an opening for an attack and brought his green blade down to the floor. Unfortunately, he just ended up pinning the black robes to the ground and not Strife. The Jedi Master brought his sword back up, cutting the black robes in two. The Sith Lord, now clad in a black tunic, kipped-up to his feet and squared off with Lorhas again.
Darth Strife: "Just lend me the farghul...we don't need to do this."
Master Lorhas: "Why...so you can show her the teachings of the Sith?"
Darth Strife: "No you fool! She must be trained to her true potential by someone fit to do so...Neither the Jedi nor the Sith are fit to bring this about. However, the responsibility lies with me to show her the way.. Not because of my belief...but because of what I can give her."
The two men circled each other with their lightsabers raised to mid-level. Lorhas was obviously deep in thought at the Dark Lord's words.
*It is now Kaz Jee's turn.*

Sarin takes Aymaric on his shoulder and uses the Force to burst ahead. The cybernetic mandalorian had the exit focused in his eyes. His large feet shook the ground each time he glided to the next footfall.
Although Gor 'Ak wasn't as fast, he followed Sarin as best as he could. He observed the two warriors engaged in a fierce lightsaber duel but continued toward the quarters where the rest of the team was.
The fleeing individuals were subject to the stream of blaster bolts coming from the unrelenting droids. It seemed they did not mind at all to shoot people in the back even if they were running. Sarin pushed through the streaming fire and made it in the door. Gor 'Ak was able to make it a few seconds later without being struck from a shot. The blaster bolts were impacting harmlessly on the tapestries on the wall closest to the exit door. Indeed, they had certainly been trying to hit Sarin and Gor.
Once everyone was in the room, Vor'en organized a hasty formation. Lues took point of the group, while everyone else followed his lead. Sarin grabbed Awne from Feldon's carry and slung her on his shoulder. Feldon gave Sarin a look of respect at the motion.
Red Team proceeded down the transparisteel tunnel overlooking the vast cloning machines configuration. The alarms from the siren were now at full volume.
**YOU NOW HAVE 15 MINUTES TO REACH MINIMUM SAFE DISTANCE…ALL PERSONNEL EVACUATE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.**
The Jedi Knight led the group's way back down the turbolift toward the production area. Once everyone had gathered at the bottom, they jogged at a decent pace toward the humongous blast door. Thankfully, the door was still open. They moved the rest of the way through the colossal area and passed through the code cylinder protected doorway.
Gor 'Ak felt the nipping sensation of fatigue biting at him as he moved somewhat behind Sarin. He had been through a lot in this mission and the pain had definitely caught up to him.
The next passageway was the familiar pristine white hallway. Qwy's body was still laying there motionless. *If anyone wants to pick him up, go ahead and mention that in your next post.*
The group took just a brief moment to handle their business, then started jogging toward the reception area in which they had first taken contact. They ran past the fallen corpses and took a right to the large door in which they had initially breached. Apparently, the twi'lek that had been restrained was no longer among the dead. Feldon watched behind the group as everyone crawled through the hole that the Jedi had carved.
Once everyone was through the door, they moved through the expansive cavern area where the sentry guns had been. In no time they were back in the narrow rock tunnel. The cool air and dripping rocks were slightly relaxing despite the imminent self-destruction. Once through the tunnel, they boarded the lift.
The lift activated with a delayed motor reaction. It churned up slowly through the darkness of the tunnel ascent. That's when it happened.
**TAG: Awne and Woroken**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Kel-Yun Lorhas' spirit screamed out in pain toward the two padawans. It was evident that the Sith Lord had struck a fatal blow to Woroken's master. The pain quickly disappeared from their thoughts....and it was utter silence. Utter silence of Lorhas' presence in the Force...and the darkness of the lift seemed to punctuate that feeling.

</details>

Lues whispered to himself.
Lues Van: "Goodbye my friend."
The lift finally arrived at the cavernous room lit by tall glow rods. The team formed up in a more organized manner this time and went into the next tunnel. They took high steps on the slippery rocks to reach the top of Vjun's surface. Everyone was definitely fatigued as you all heard the sound of heavy breathing coming from your teammates. Within moments, everyone saw the daylight of Vjun.
You were back on the rocky peak that led to the facility entrance. The clouds of Vjun were as thick as usual, but it was daylight. The orange atmosphere was almost welcoming compared to being underground.
The group started walking around the awkward hills and annoying rocks. They were trying to walk a good distance from the facility entrance. With a little luck, the explosion wouldn't pierce the surface. Vor'en checked his chrono and noticed it was twenty minutes past afternoon by Vjun's time. There was nothing of interest among the rocky peaks. It was typical for this barren planet. But at a time like this, nothingness was good.
Feldon looked around quickly....
Feldon Azrik: "Everyone ok? We got everybody?"
*Ok, it's back to free roleplay. Combat has ended. I will reward XP for battle shortly.*

Finally finding a moments respite, Gor settled down on the nearest place he could find to sit, drawing several deep breaths. His hand moving almost without his awareness, he managed to produce a small piece of a field ration from his belt, and started to press it down. It wouldn´t have tasted very much or very good normally, but at this state of exhaustion, very few things did. After catching his breath though, he stood up.
"I think we got everyone, but saying we´re ok is probably lying"
Yes indeed it was. He needed only to smell the burnt fur on his back to realize this was correct. At least they would be getting out of here now, he figured. With the person they were sent to recover dead, it seemed the mission would be over, and the only thing left to do would be to return for debriefing. Unfortunately, this mission had left them - or at least him - with a lot of new questions to bring home.

As Vor'en makes it into the other room. He holsters his blaster, He leans against the far wall head resting on it. He slams his fist into the wall he does not care if his hand is broken or not. "It was not supposed to end like this! We where supposed to bring her home and destroy Falsoor!" His words quite but full of anger. He focuses himself and turns to his team. "Ok lets get out of here or we are all dead. I am taking point everyone else follow as fast as you can. Lets go." Vor'en heads out the door and toward the way out.

The wookiee was clearly shaken by the feeling that his Master was now gone. He slumped down beside Gor, without realizing what he was doing.
He didn't exactly know what to do. He had always had Lorhas to lean on for guidance. Of course Lorhas would have known exactly what to do, but right now, the wookiee couldn't think what it might have been. As Woro wasn't really one to share, he decided to try and meditate. Just before actually doing so, he remembered that in the heat of the moment, he had retrieved Awne's sundered arm and saber. He hopped up, and moved to Aymaric, and pointed to the extremity in his pack. "Think you can heal Awne?" he grunted.

### **Anonymous** (2009-11-25 23:26:56)

Aymaric looked up from the repulsor stretcher that held the half body of Qwy. He looked back down at the Selkath without a word to Woro and finished covering Qwy with his A-T cloak. "Seems like a good idea Woro. I don't think Jedi do well without their arms right." He looks up at the Wookie with a wilted smile, then takes the arm and walks over to Awne.
His smile and demeanor improve once he is near Awne, remembering some instruction from a faceless professor who told his class to always smile when with the sick, their condition is probably worse than yours and they need all the help they can get. "Hey Awne, how ya doin'?" Holding up her arm, he gives her a big smile and says. "I think you left this back there." As soon as he said it though, he knew it was a really bad time for that kind of comment. "Sorry, just a little tired I think." Toning down his smile he continues talking to Awne. "Here, take this and lay back. The meds will take a moment to work and I will add a shot as well. Luckily the Sabre causes tissue and arteries to cauterize, which is why you are still alive." Administering the shots, he sets up his medical supplies while he waits for them to take effect. "Woro, can you give me a hand here. Your skills will help considerably. We should also put her on your stretcher so she's more comfortable."
(I'm going to assume all are cooperating, sorry if it seems a little Metagamie <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> )
Once Awne is on the stretcher and he is certain the meds have taken effect, he starts to sew the amputated arm back on.

At Aymaric's request Woro trudges over, and begins assisting the medic in an attempt to heal Awne. As he got there, he winced a bit at the medic's attempts at humor, but he appreciated the effort for Awne's sake nonetheless. This level of medicine was certainly beyond his own knowledge, but he knew enough to help a bit. He kept the farghul steady as the medication began to take its effect her, and watched Aymaric go to work.

Kardoon estimated that the volatile facility would be mostly contained underground, but it was much safer to get as much distance as possible. He warned Sergeant Vor'en of this and the soldier took point.
Feldon looked over to the others who were administering medical treatment. Everyone tiredly pushed forward despite their fatigue.
Feldon Azrik: "Sorry guys, we don't have time for that just yet. We need to gain some distance."
With that, the group moved at a decent pace across the rocky landscape.
After about 5 minutes of rough terrain and climbing slopes, you saw something colossal rising vertically from the red mountain tops.
![GR-75_Medium_Transport.jpg](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/e/eb/GR-75_Medium_Transport.jpg)
The ship was coming from somewhere that would be a relative distance to the facility. So, it was likely that it had something to do with Strife. The 90 meter long ship would be in orbit in mere moments. It oriented itself to the clouds and it's blue atmospheric thrusters kicked in.
And suddenly, Sergeant Vor'en's helmet comlink beeped in his ears.

The group takes a moment to pause after noticing the transport take off in the distance. The formation spread out in a more security-oriented manner. A lot of the people keeping eyes out elected to sit on the numerous red rocks laying about. Aymaric and Woroken stayed in the center of the formation base to treat Awne's wounds however.
Woroken administered some medicine by mouth for pain management, which immediately made the pain subside in Awne's shoulder and arm socket. Aymaric then plugged Awne's shoulder injury with a regenerative injection. It should do something to repair the damaged cells in the lightsaber wound. Once that was handled, he applied some ointment to the burnt flesh. He then patched it up, knowing it was too early for synthflesh.
That's when the surprise came. Aymaric observed that Awne's arm socket seemed to be showing some signs of regeneration. This was very strange, as the cauterized skin seemed to be fixing itself. Skin was actually growing atop of damaged cells. Perhaps he should question Awne about this. He was hesitant to put the arm on if she was able to regenerate a new arm.
Meanwhile, Vor'en continued to listen to his comlink.

While Aymaric was working on Awne, a ominous boom can be heard underground in the distance. There was an initial boom, followed by a chain of explosions. It seemed you guys were definitely at a safe distance from the destruction. There was a smoke plume rising up from the red/brown cliffs a good length down where the entrance was. Everyone who was staring off into the mountainous horizon looked around in curiosity. One of the Jedi made a comment.

Awne was exhausted, she felt as though any moment her legs were going to give out and she would pass out to the blissful blackness of unconsciousness....but then her master would move again and her eyes would open to put one foot in front of the other. She wanted to go back, but she knew she wouldn't stand a chance and for that knowledge she was great full that Lorhas was going back.
Continuing on the fatigue was getting worse, how much longer could she really go on? wait...is that...it is...the body of their fallen comrade, they were almost out. She had to smile, hefting herself with the help of her master she forces her body to move past the fatigue they were almost out!
pain..
Her foot catches at the suddenness of a pain not her own, for a change, but of someone else, Lorhas...no...Woro...She was having trouble dealing with the feeling and could only imagine how it was for him.
Light..
They were out, and moving still away. And oh...this brief pause. She couldn't stand anymore, her legs give as she slides from her masters hold to her knees on the ground then over to her side and to her back with a sigh. Her eyes close for a few minutes until the others approach trying to help her again. She was moved, at least, she hoped she was being moved otherwise there were a lot more things wrong with her than she thought.
She knew Woro was there, big fuzzy that he was and she felt the smaller fuzzy near by, heh...fuzzies..."Sorrrry 'bout Lorrhas Worro.." she mumbles.
At least she trusted Woro and knew whatever it was he was giving her was helping, she didn't feel any pain in her arm, and that salve was soothing. She breathes deeply, eyes closing to rest a bit more; that salve really did feel soothing, even felt like she was feeling better! They should market that stuff...wait maybe they did...how come other salve didn't feel like this? weird...heh her subconscious was funny..or she was crazy...meh.

"Thank Awne," Woro muttered as he helped her to her feet, so that the team could be moved out. He was trying to keep his mind occupied, so he wouldn't have to process the fact that his Master was gone. "We can talk about it later. Let's get you fixed up first..." Calling Lorhas's death "it" did not help any with the knot that had formed in Woro's stomach.
Woro and Lorhas had spoke of death many times. Lorhas had never seemed to fear death, and often spoke of becoming one with the Force. The wookiee didn't fear it for himself either, but he desperately wanted to keep his friends hale and hearty. This mission had been the direct opposite of that. He wondered if perhaps he should have ignored Lorhas's warning and helped with fight Strife. Perhaps the two of them could have succeeded? He silently cursed himself for not having more of an independent streak, like Awne. Maybe if he had, Lorhas would have been walking with them right now.

Awne whines faintly as she was moved again, this time to standing. She didn't wanna be up she wanted to lay down! Yes she was fully aware that she was throwing a tantrum but thankfully it was only in her head.
She sighs as, once again, she was on her feet. She was feeling a little better though...her tail flicks faintly to steady her as she moves her good arm to her master, and around him again for support. She breathes deeply and looks to the old soldier "what'rre we standing arround forr then. We have a long walk, lets get going. The soonerr we move the soonerr we get on a nice ship"
She nods and takes a step, without the pain in her arm and the slight rest she had she felt a little like she could stabilize herself, even going so far as to try it on a whim, walking a bit on her own. "showerrs...food...nice beds..soonerr we get therre the betterr." she mumbles to herself, nice long shower was in her agenda.

The Sergeant remembered that his training involved a lot of movement without making a lot of noise...and sending the *Starshade* to an unprepared landing zone was a good way to let everyone know where they would be. SpecForces were often required to do a lot of patrolling on foot with minimal sound. But, the light freighter also had considerable firepower. It could likely handle the stuff they had encountered with ease. However, if anymore smuggler ships came around, it could be trouble. What was the best choice in this situation?
Meanwhile, at the mention of the mounts, everyone in the patrol remembered that they were supposed to contact Drayden when they needed the kybucks again.

Just as Aymaric had finished up on Awne, Vor'en ordered the group to move out. Everyone would be following Kardoon's lead. The chiss used his datapad to gather his bearings and oriented the group west. While the patrol was collecting up their gear, Vor'en heard his comlink chirp to life.
**Over the comlink:**
Drayden: "Oh...it's you again. I'll be right to you with your ride."
Kardoon led the way down a rocky ridge. He knew this was the fastest way, but somewhat difficult. The team worked together by passing off weapons and supporting each other down the steep inclines. Once the group got to level ground again, you heard the familiar sound of kybucks trampling rocks.
After a few moments, the brown-furred mounts were spread out amongst the group. Erika and Drayden were leading the pack. Drayden gave a pat to one of his kybucks as it trotted over to Aymaric.
Drayden: "Everyone ready?"
Once everyone saddled into their mounts, after helping Sarin's large build onto a kybuck, the group started ascending the steep terrain. The kybucks hopped easily from perch to perch...and when there was flat ground they moved very quickly. Sarin's kybuck was visibly lagging behind. A few times Drayden had to turn the group around to go back for him.
Otherwise, it was an uneventful ride back to the refugee camp in the damp cave. Nothing seemed to have changed much, except that some of the family members seemed to be prepared to go traveling.
Erika gathered up the kybucks from everyone and sent them to their pen at the back of the cavernous refuge. She made careful notice to avoid Aymaric's glancing eyes.
Drayden approached Vor'en after everyone was off their kybucks. He made sure to speak to everyone around. He ran his hands through his greasy black beard and balding head.
Drayden: "You guys been through a lot eh? So uh...we are ready to leave when you guys are."

Dismounting his Kybuck, Kardoon immediatley goes to his droids, pulling the badly damaged one to the ground he begins repairs. " Damn droids, always getting shot up, you'd think they'd program them with common sense. " speaking out loud " Dont worry, i'm gonna upgrade your guys systems as soon as we get somewhere hospitable." Getting into these droids was semi difficult, but easier than the last pair he was issued, those were like a pair of glitchy trash compactors so he traded them in for these two.

Vo'ren went over the map stored in his datapad. According to the datapad, there was a valley over the mountains 2 1/2 kilometers northeast. Unfortunately, this refugee camp had to be placed in the heart of the mountains. This valley no doubt had a clear space for the *Starshade* to land.They would have to circle around the base of the mountains to get to the valley. Once there, he could have the freighter lock in on their comlink signal.
Sergeant Vor'en knew he wasn't the best with a map and directions...so perhaps he'd want to give the datapad with his downloaded map to someone who was better at this. *That would mean someone who is trained in Survival*.

Woroken was so out of sorts that he didnt even register his normal trepidation around the large kybucks. He merely mounted the beast, hung on, and dismounted same when the journey was complete. After the display of bravery he had witnessed, being scared of a kybuck didn't even register anymore.
After arriving at their destination, Woro flopped down and began munching on the rations he had taken with him before the trip began. He hadn't even noticed his hunger until he heard the old sergeant tell him to eat up.

Kardoon pops open the chassis to the back of his droid and observes the power source that had been struck by the blaster bolt. Vor'en interrupted his work and the chiss laid down his fusion cutter on the rock floor.
The chiss knew that the valley would make a perfect LZ...and the sergeant was right that it was the closest one in walking distance. It would be quick but still somewhat tiring to the already weary Red Team. Kardoon also estimated that frail people would have trouble maneuvering the mountain bases. So, it was best to only bring able bodies...even if it was only 2 1/2 klicks. After all, Red Team's luck consisted of taking engagements on a supposedly barren planet. But, it was probably best if Kardoon did the navigating to the LZ as the patrol hadn't been down that route.
After he examines the datapad, he promptly goes back to work on his droid. It wasn't much work, he simply rewired some cables and the droid powered back to life. He sealed the back of the chassis and watched his droid stand up.

*RED ROCKS OUTSIDE THE MINING FACILITY*
The meatball surgery had gone as well as expected considering the conditions he was working under. Aymaric had been disappointed when the order to move had been given again. He was more surprised however when he realized that Awne's arm was healing itself. Form the knowledge he remembered of the Farghul race, he was certain that this was not common. The questions would have to wait though, Vor'en was moving them again and Awne was still incoherent from the drugs Woroken had given her.
*THE REFUGEE CAMP*
Erika brought some of the sanity back to Aymaric's mind. Since the grenade that had splattered Qwy's blood on his uniform, Aymaric had been in and out of rational thought. He also felt as though he had been looking through another mans eyes most of the time since then. Erika's innocent smile and girlish behavior helped Aymaric become his old self again. Although they didn't fix all his internal issues, it was a great start. He couldn't take her eyes off her, even though he knew he was being creepy and felt very weird, he just couldn't stop.
His attention was diverted though when he spotted the one armed Farghul getting a bite to eat with her now ever present Ewok by her side. "Awne, I need to talk to yo about something." Sitting down next to her je removes his helmet and speaks in a low tone, hoping the Ewok was either asleep or didn't care about what was about to be discussed. "You..while I..." His face takes on a look of extreme concentration. "I think your severed arm is growing back. "A sigh, possibly one of relief, emits from the mans lips before he continues. "That's not normal for a Farghul right? I don't remember your species being on the list of regeneratives when I was at school." Pausing a moment before continuing. "I have a thousand questions, but I think now is not the time unless you can think of a reason of your own?" He had only two thoughts as he waited for a response from Awne. Is she suffering some ill effects from the mining factory or is she a surgically altered spy who's base species has regenerative abilities? Either one could mean extreme danger and he hoped it was neither one.

Stuttering...that was new, she raises a brow at him why was he stut-"I think your severed arm is growing back."
That was new, she blinks a few times at him, her lips pausing mid-bite lowering it slowly "you..what?" She looks to the stump that was her arm and saw the healthy flesh, even believing that the stump maybe had a bit more to it.
"It's..grrowing?" she looks up to the human in surprise, well that would explain why it was feeling better. She shakes her head to the few questions he asked "no no it's not norrmal..not to my knowledge at least, then again I haven't met a whole many of them.."
She glances up to him and simply says "adopted by a human." and looks back to her arm, letting the wafer fall to her lap as she touches it slightly "Maybe...it's a jedi thing?"

"No, I haven't told anyone but you about it. It seemed to be something unusual and even though I didn't technically graduate as a Doctor, I still feel the need to protect a patients privacy." A tiny smile pops onto the man's face. "Now if that..." Pointing at the stump. "...starts to grow another one of you, I'll have to find a collar with a bell so we can tell you apart." He wanted to believe that she would understand the reference to the domesticated cats common to Coruscant and that she wouldn't take offence.

"Yes we do at that. I imagine that the debrief will be almost as tiring as this mission was." Vor'en finishes checking on his team. "We gether alot of info in there. It almost cost us everything. I think we are going to have to make sure Gor is ready to go as well he took a beating from Strife. A lesser man would have given up and died but he didn't he'll make a good leader one day, as soon as he stops trying to get himself killed al the time." Smiling a bit again Vor'en finds a place to eat down and wait for everyone else to get ready and finish his ration.

Gor remained unusually quiet during the trip back to the refugees. He just went about doing his normal tasks, keeping lookout, helping to read the map, stuff like that. Basically the reason for this was as simple as one might suspect, he was in pain. He had come closer to death than ever before, and it had been a lot closer than he had really liked. He would need to brush up on whatever information was available on how to fight a Sith Lord, although he hoped he would never be in a similar situation again.

In the middle of his conversation with Awne, Aymaric remembers a very important situation that needed to be addressed. The last few hours had been stressful and Aymaric was embarrased that he had overlooked something so important.
Picking up his helmet he turns the com link on and speaks to Vor'en. "Vor'en, please gather up Red Team and bring them to the southern most wall where Awne and I are, especially Gor." Memories of the hits Gor took and knowing he was in severe pain made the medic put a little extra urgency in his tone. "Vor'en...Sergeant, we need down time and we can't wait for the ship to show up."
Dropping his helmet back on the ground before waiting for a reply, he looks back at Awne. "Please continue."

"Right Aymaric." "Red team rest for now we will be heading out as soon as we are able. So eat and rest." Vor'en looks around at the village he was in. It was peaceful now, but on this planet that could change quickly. He sets back and relaxes a bit himself.

**Uan's Shop**
The chiss crawled back through the cavern tunnel to get the shop. He saw the usual assortment of plasteel bins, wall displays, and items scattered about the table. Most of her inventory seemed to be depleted. The human woman seemed to be fiddling with a datapad. She looked over to Kardoon.
Uan: "Let's see what you have."
The smuggler was also still locked in an energy cage in the back corner.
**Refugee Entrance**
While Aymaric and Awne were conversing, Feldon kneeled over to the farghul who was resting. The Jedi Knight was thankful to see the woman off of her feet and getting some rest. He knew they had time to spare until the mission deadline, so what was wrong with some much needed relaxation?
Feldon placed his hand on Awne's shoulder, where Strife's lightsaber had cut through. Within seconds, Awne felt the cooling energy of the Force mending her wounds. Feldon wiped his dirty face off and smiled at Awne. It also appeared that Feldon was eluding mentioning anything about Master Lorhas.
Feldon: "That better?"

Kardoon moves over to the same corner of the cave he had when they first got here which felt like so long ago, how long had it been, 1 day or two?

Will call you in 8 hours with Landing Zone. Over and out." "Red Team we will be moving out in 8 hours for LZ. Get rested a be ready to move out in that time. Red Seven out."

**Refugee camp entrance**
Feldon gave Awne a pat on the shoulder and stood up from her position. He looked amongst the patrol to see if anyone else was in need of care. He noticed Gor whom was leading up against the cavern wall. The Jedi Knight walked over to him and took a knee at his side.
Feldon: "How you feeling? You look kind of rough. But I got something that will do just the thing. I know you're not a big believer in the Force...but..."
Feldon rested his hand on Gor's shoulder. After a few moments, the bothan felt wondrous energy surging through him. He felt a lot better than before.
*Gor 'Ak restores 36 HP.*
Drayden listens to Vor'en as he orders his men to sleep. The chief of security ushers the group to use some emergency cots. The patrol sets up some cots and sleeps for a good 8 hours.
Once it hits about night time on Vjun, everyone starts waking up slowly. It appeared Lues and Feldon were on watch most of the time. Daylight was no longer crawling into the cavern refuge. It was night time. It was good timing, as it was better to move with the cover of the night, as per SpecForces training.

Vor'en awakens to the sounds of people moving near by him.

"Drayden, have your people take only what they need to survive we are going to cross some tuff terrain the less we take the easier it will be." After issuing his orders he takes a drink from his canteen to clear the dust out of his mouth and then starts to chew on part of a ration. "Feldon, everyone ready for the trek to the ship? Gor comm the Starshade and give tell them where to meet us. Lets get off this nightmare of a planet while we can people." He realizes that this was the refugees home before all the craziness but he had had his fill of this place and wanted to go back to base. With that thought he checks over what is let of his gear.

Awne blinks at the odd notion, then again if this collar was pretty and the bell shiny...hm...she couldn't fathom the idea but...wait...didn't her father tell her there were other feline races that weren't sentient? Ohh...a cat! he was talking about a cat!
It seemed like forever but her lips part in a smile as she understands the joke and laughs "I suppose you might have to." she chuckles faintly and glances up to her master as he leaves.
It's some time before she see's the others beginning to lay down to rest. her arm drapes over the Ewok as she rests her head "I think it's a good idea forr all of us to get some sleep don't you?" She pats the ground, a simple signal that she wouldn't mind him staying with her and the little fuzzy. Her eyes close as she slips to sleep with a sigh.
Her dreams are of home, forests, her father, the others were there too, with a little cat that apparently had wandered in from the human doctor's tease. Odd dream but...it was a good one, and she was glad for that.
It felt like only a few minutes but soon others were moving and her eyes open again to see everyone bustling about. She sighs and shifts about looking to the Ewok and then over to the human then down to her stump to see if it had changed.

Kardoon felt nothing heard nothing, he was in a blackness he had never encountered before, a sleep so deep he could have been dead. As the hours pass the blackness turnes to a pulsing crimson, a horrible nightmare where he was drowning in blood, he wakes with a start a scream stifled on his tongue. Looking around he felt the panick subside, he was alright, a little sore but fine. Wiping his eyes he pulls his E-5 out waiting for the rest of the group to stir. Putting the slightly used power pack on the recharger he slaps a fresh one in (500/500) and begins inspecting the rifle for any damage or any way he could improve it.[

### **Dreamwalker** (2009-11-29 15:04:44)

After everyone got out of their cots, the preliminary checks for the upcoming movement began. The weapons, packs, and welfare of the patrol members were all inspected quickly by Vor'en. Kardoon spent extra time on his E-5 and noticed it was in perfect working condition. It seemed they were ready to go to the LZ after a good sleep. Although some people were still immensely drowsy and would have preferred to sleep 12 hours.
Drayden and a woman in her thirties approached Vor'en through the patrol formation. The woman had short black hair and striking blue eyes.
Drayden: "Hi, its just me and her going with you. We'll get a lift in your ship and wherever you drop us off we'll get a rescue to come pick up the entire bulk of my camp."
Woman: "I'm Liza...nice to meet you."
The two Falsoor employees were armed with sporting blaster rifles. The Sergeant tells the two to stick by him and has the group move out of the refugee camp into the darkness of Vjun.
Lues and Kardoon were at the front of the formation. The chiss was using Vor's datapad to steer the group at a thick patch of mountains. They arrived at a base of a mountain in the foggy darkness.
The group began walking up the steep rock and most of the patrol could feel agony in their bones as they pushed their bodies. Thankfully, the aura of Vjun was mercifully quiet at the moment...
The patrol spends about 15 minutes walking on the side of the mountain on a nice trail that the chiss had found. The feeling of getting across this steep earth was empowering because everyone knew they were getting off this rock in a few moments.
Then, everyone started to proceed down the other side of the mountain. Some people even slipped and lost their footing. But they got up with frustration and carried on anyways. After about 5 minutes the group walked onto level ground and awed at the open rock valley they were in.
They could finally see level ground...and the vast mountain ranges surrounding the valley in every direction. It would of been nice to have moonlight speckle the valley, but the Vjun cloud cover was always so thick.
Despite arriving in the valley, Sergeant Vor'en made sure none of the men were complacent. He pushed them out in a 360 degree radial formation. This formation would effectively cover all angles in case someone brought an ambush down on them in the valley. It was still questionable on the odds of running into anything else out here.
Sergeant Vor'en commed the *Starshade.* He informed Lance they were ready for pickup. After a few moments of quiet anticipation, you heard the glorious sound of the freighter's atmospheric thrusters in the background. After you hear this, the ship was already in its landing cycle to land in the center of the patrol. The landing thrusters pushed dust everywhere as it landed on the rocky valley ground.
The ramp on the freighter dropped down, and the Kiffar soldier came walking down it. He waved his hands to the patrol to signal everything was ready. The atmospheric engines were still going at full-bore...letting you know that it was ready to lift-off. The patrol looked at each other in anticipation, waiting for the order from Vor'en to get aboard.

He didn't intend on falling asleep so soon. He had wanted to get everyone gathered together so he could administer medical aid to everyone at once, but that didn't happen. The last thing he remembered was Awne's non-verbal invitation to sit down and relax next to her. He had wanted to talk more about her arm and ask Feldon if he knew anything about an occurance like this. Non of this happened though, he went straight to sleep and woke up exactly where he had sat down, with his mostly empty rations pack on his lap. He hadn't dreamed, or maybe he just couldn't remember, either one was okay with him.
Now. Now he was sitting in Vijun desert again trying not to be deafened by the down draft from the rescue ships thrusters. Before hearing any orders, the man named Aymaric stands up taps the person next to him on the shoulder, yelling. "I"M GOING TO THE SHIP. COVER MY SPOT!" With his Snare rifle and Med Pack on his back, he grabs hold of the Republic issue blaster rifle he retrieved from Qwy's remains and heads towards the ramp. Thoughts of the last few hours running through his head. *"I hope Drayden' men take care of Qwy's body like he promised, I wonder why Erika was avoiding me, I hope the Med bay on this ship is well equipped."*
Boarding the entry ramp, he waves to a man he barely remembers, a sense of Deja Vu overcoming him, and starts to look for the Med Bay.

The wookiee hadn't slept much as he kept thinking about all the happenings from yesterday, from Lorhas's sacrifice, to the Sith Lord, the truth behind Mur Eva's past, and Red Team's failure to bring back its full team. He heard Feldon and Leus making their rounds on patrol much of the night.
He arose quietly with the rest of the team and marched along in contemplation of his next course of action. Woro knew that the next few days would consist of information relaying, and debriefings, as they had discovered much about Falsoor. Woro's plan was to speak to Feldon and Leus after they rested, to glean any information possible about the Sith Lord and his obvious connection to Lorhas. His Master's photo being in Strife's lair troubled him. He hoped that might be a clue as to the identity of the Sith.
Before he knew it, the ship presented itself in front of him. He watched for trouble as the medic sprinted toward the ship, no doubt heading for the med bay. He waited for Vor's command before he broke ranks to head for the ship. The last thing they needed was to be ambushed before getting off this awful planet.

The Sergeant scouted the valley LZ. He could see nothing in the horizon or anything up close. The 360 formation collapsed in a not so organized manner. Everyone began walking up the entry ramp to the YT-2000. It had rust colored trim and was definitely a more rugged ship than you've seen.
![YT-2000.jpg](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/b/b1/YT-2000.jpg)
Lance was giving out instructions at the top of the ramp where it was more quiet.
Lance: "Take all of the dead to the cargo holds and clean them up. Obviously, take the wounded to the medical bay. We'll need someone good on the stick to fly this thing."
Lance watched as the last man climbed aboard, he then promptly closed ramp.
Lance: "Ramp closing."
The boarding ramp closed itself and sealed with a hiss. Everyone was now in the comfort of the freighter and now the next thing to do was to get out of here.
*Here are the places you can visit inside the freighter:
