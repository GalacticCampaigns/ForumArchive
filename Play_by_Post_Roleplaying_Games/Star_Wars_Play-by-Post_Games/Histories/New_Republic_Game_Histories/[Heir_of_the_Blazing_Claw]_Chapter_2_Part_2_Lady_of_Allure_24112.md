# [Heir of the Blazing Claw] Chapter 2 Part 2: Lady of Allure

### **Avarna** (2009-05-16 19:59:07)

Its been two weeks since the battle to take the Mobile Spacedock from the scavengers. Naroon, along with Kyle Corran and Trin have been busy, along with the Boarders from the *Hope Fades* as some of the captured scavengers who have agreed to join the pirates have been divided between the spacedock, the *Hope Fades* and the *Frylla's Gold*.
But now you've all been called back to the *Hope Fades*, and wait patently in the conference room. Finally the Duros Captain Gemthrine enters the room, and takes a seat at the head of the table, OOM-45 takes his place behind the captain, who starts the briefing.
"I am going to make short. Between replacing lost starfighters, Repairs to the *Hope Fades* and *Frylla's Gold*, as well as hiring a full staff for the Mobile Spacedock, our operational finances are dangerously low." Dosha takes a moment to look at the battledroid behind him before continuing. "That is why I'm forced to send you on a very risky, if very lucrative assignment."
The holographic image of a Mon Cal luxury liner appears on the holo projector in the center of the table. "This is an image of the *Lady of Allure*, Now while many Mon Cal cruisers were rebuilt into warships to assist the Rebellion, This is one of the few to escape conversion. Your mission is simple. Hijack the *Lady* and ransom off her passengers."

Trin's stomach had felt uneasy as soon as the holo of the Mon Cal ship appeared, but it flipped end over end as Gemthrine finished. He had served aboard a series of liners like that at the beginning of his shipboard career, what seemed to be a hundred years ago. He had even been aboard the *Kuari Princess* when she was hijacked by pirates. That was the first time--the only time so far--that he'd had to kill someone. Even if the crew of the *Hope Fades* was going in without any bloodthirst, he knew all too well what it was like to be on the receiving end.
*Well, old boy,"*, he thought, *was there something about the word 'pirate' you didn't understand?"*
Ignoring his queasiness, he asked, "What's our plan of attack, Captain?"

Naroon looked at the display of the Mon Calamari cruiser and an idea sprung to his mind. Turning towards the doctor;
"We may not **need** to attack. Tell me doctor, do most species of the galaxy require similar levels of oxygen to stay awake?"
Maybe this mission required more finesse than brute force.

Kyle listened to the briefing with indifference. Sure, once he had thought himself above doing this kind of thing, but things sure had changed, hadnÂ´t they. He still wouldnÂ´t go on a slaughter rampage, and he wouldnÂ´t go out of his way to kill someone unless explicitly necessary, but he would do what was needed.
As the captain finishes, he poses the most paramount question in his mind.
"What about escorts? The cruiser itself might not have been converted into a warship, but I doubt it flies completely defenseless"

### **Alicia** (2009-05-17 17:18:58)

"Medric is already assembling a team to accompany you using the skipray and any other escorts you wish to take with you. As for the liner's own escorts you can expect possibly a couple starfighters."
Leaving the holo-image on for you all to deliberate over he makes one final statement. "However you wish to proceed just remember: A dead hostage is a worthless hostage."

Corran sets in the meeting room listening to the meeting. *"So we are grabbing Hostages now huh. I guess we need the credits."*  Corran surprise himself that he has little roblem with this. He waits untill the meeting is over and follows the rest of the team out. "I need to grab my gear and i will meet you at the ship." Corran heads to his quarters.

Trin takes in the captain's words, then turns to Naroon. "You know, you may just be on to something. The Mon Cal ships I served on were set up to carry many different species. That meant extensive atmosphere control equipment. We had passengers that breathed eveything from normal air to helium to a fog with droplets of sulfuric acid in place of water."
He leans back in his chair, stroking his beard as he speaks. "My point is, there's almost certainly an atmosphere control panel in engineering that would let us reduce the oxygen like Naroon has proposed. There was on the ships I served on. But here's an even better idea: We could probably mix a general anesthetic using their own equipment and pump it into every room on board. A simple gas anesthesia from the dark ages of medicine like nitrous oxide or diethyl ether would do the trick nicely. Once all the airbreathers go night-night, we'd only have to deal with a tiny percentage of the crew and passengers. Keep in mind that there are probably hundreds of droids aboard, but most of them are service droids like valets, janitorial units, that sort of thing."
"The best way to do it may be a boarding action like the one we just did, but maybe we should consider something more covert. Could we go aboard as passengers or stowaways and then infiltrate engineering? Once we did that, we could let the rest of the boarding party aboard. If it works, we could ransom the whole bloody ship, whether we did a boarding action or snuck our way in."
((Not to belabor the point, but the atmospheric control equipment is canon. The *Kuari Princess* has one in the module "Riders of the Maelstrom." It even mentions that the PCs can flood the ship with anesthesia if they succeed in the right skill checks.))

EDIT: Just to clarify, we're still in the system where we ambushed the spacedock, right? We haven't returned to Point Nadir?))

"Ok, Doc. So, if you're right about this, we just go on as passengers, sneak into engineering, and knock everybody out. That way we get hostages without death. Sounds like a good plan to me. As to the droids, do you know if some of them, or preferably all of them, are controlled by a central processor? That would enable us to disable most of the crew, passengers, and droids in a few fell swoops. Leaving the ship and hostages available for ransoming. What do the rest of you think?"

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-19 08:17:04)

"No, the droids would be the usual type with onboard processors. That said, some outfits that use security droids use a central processor, and that's the sort of thing that would vary from ship to ship."
"What do you think, Kyle? And let's run this by Medric. He's been doing this a lot longer than us."

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 2: Lady of Allure

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-19 12:45:41)

"IÂ´d say we probably canÂ´t count on the droids using a central processor. As far as I know such systems are mainly used in the case of a really large group of droids, for instance to coordinate droid armies. It would also make extremely little sense from a security perspective if they now *are* using droids for security"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-19 17:42:36)

"Well, since I am assuming we want to keep causalities to a minimum, IÂ´d say it is a pretty good plan. If it goes according to plan, we should be left with a knocked out ship with hopefully only a few utility droids aboard. However, as there is no plan that survives contact with the enemy, we should be quick about seizing control of other central parts of the ship, mainly the helm, the communications, and the hangar"

Medric can be found in the hanger bay, supervising the techs go over the Skipray one last time. Upon seeing you the Togorian rumbles, "Took you long enough."

### **ganthet** (2009-05-21 11:08:14)

Corran walks into the hanger bay with his med gear and weapons. He stops by the Skipray, looking for his team mates. He sees Medric and walks toward him. "Sorry boss just making sure I have all my med gear to help keep you guys fighting. So hows this going to happen? We going run in guns a blazing or is this a sneaky kind of thing." Corran smiles and waits for the others to show up.

Realizing that Corran had up and left, Naroon got up and headed for the hangar bay. That is where he found the requisition officer last time. When he got there, he took a look around to see if she was there.

nTrin stops by his quarters and changes into an officer's uniform he had kept from one of his more upscale assignments. It might fool a crewman or passenger, or even make them hesitate for a crucial second in a firefight. He then heads to medbay to collect Six and his medical bag before making his way to the hangar and Medric.
> &quot;Took you long enough.&quot;

"Sorry boss, but you know what a drag meetings can be," Trin jokes. "Seriously, though, Naroon and I came up with an idea we'd like to run by you." He details the plan to anesthetize the crew and passengers, leaving out the alternate idea of going aboard undercover, since it's obvious the Skipray is being prepped for a reason. "What do you think? And how many starfighters are we taking with us? I'd like to make their escorts' lives hell right out of the gate."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-25 19:29:45)

"Well, letÂ´s not waste anymore time then, shall we?"
Leaving the Togorian to oversee the Skipray, Kyle walked over to his own ship, and began to prepare her for takeoff.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 2: Lady of Allure

### **Alicia** (2009-05-27 12:48:15)

As you talk to Medric, five others make their way onto the Skipray. A Chadra-fan, a Barabel, and three humans (one woman). The chadra-fan takes a seat, his legs dangling off the floor, and starts fidgeting with a piece of tech. The others go about double checking their equipment except the Barabel who leans against a bulkhead with his powerhammer next to him.
Medric nods in satisfaction as his team gathers. "Once you're ready, we're good to go."
"We're still going to have to get on the ship. Unless you are willing to front the money for your ticket on the liner I would think of something else." Medric says in regards to your plan.
--------------------------------------------------------
The requisition officer has a number of electronic devices. ((prices listed in the books unless otherwise noted below.))
Portable Computer
Bracer Computer
Interface visor
And what appears to be a supped up datapad. Datapad: 2,500 credits. ((Same function just higher with a higher INT))

"Nope don't have the credits or the attire for that. So if you don't mind I will take my seat in the back with the support staff." Corran walks into the skipray and finds a comfontable place to set and wait for them to get under way. "Hey Old man you coming along or what?" Corran smiles at Trin. "We ain't got all day." Corran knew he would be in the rear with the gear as usual clean up wounds and maybe bust a head or two along the way. Who knows what the future would hold.

"Old man? Keep that up and I'll wallop you with my cane, whippersnapper. No, Medric, we weren't planning on sneaking aboard anymore. We just figure that once we blast our way in, we could go to engineering or the bridge and gas everybody. The reason we're asking you about it is because you're the expert. If you think it can work, I think we should try it. If you don't, we probably shouldn't."

"I'll take the portable computer and the computer interface visor, please."
Taking his newest possessions, Naroon boarded the skipray with everyone else, hearing the latest comment about getting on board the ship.
"Here's a thought, could we forge documents to get ourselves on board? Maybe I could hack my way into their computer systems and give us worker credentials. What about those two ideas?"

---

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 2: Lady of Allure

### **Alicia** (2009-05-29 22:17:53)

Medric considers the ideas flung at him. "Getting you on by force is what we do so that will be no problem. Faking workers credentials on the other hand." He shrugged. "I have no experience with that. If you think it would work we could try it."

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-29 23:27:11)

"I'll get to work to see what I can do once we get there. I can't do much from here."
Naroon knew that the Holo-net's access, assuming he could even find any here, wouldn't grant him the access to the computers he needed. He would have to wait till he was actually at a station controlled by the company. With that in mind...
"Ok, here's the deal. I can't do anything from here. I actually have to be at a company controlled computer to access their files. So, we could either sneak our way into the offices of the company, where I create falls ID's for us, or we do it after sneaking on the ship. If neither of those work, we still have plan A. Shoot, shoot, shoot, hope we don't shoot too many."
Naroon hoped for the sneak-into-the-company plan.

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 2: Lady of Allure

### **Alicia** (2009-05-31 19:12:06)

Medric made some last minute checks. "Whatever you decide, tell me the final plan." Hitching his deckswepper barrel onto his shoulder he headed for the cockpit, bending his head to keep from hitting it in the doorways.

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-01 17:24:58)

Seeing that no one else was talking, Naroon spoke up.
"Well, why don't we head to the port where the ship is first, get our false ID's, and then sneak aboard the ship as workers or some such. Less carnage equals more profit, right?"
Naroon looks around, hoping he can avoid direct combat somehow.

"I liked that idea at first," Trin says, "but now I'm wondering if we shouldn't play to our strengths. We have a very powerful fighting force to back us up if we board her, but if we go in undercover and we're discovered, we're hanging out in the breeze. I think we can shoot, then sneak, and get to engineering while Medric and the main force fight."

## Re: Chapter 2 Part 2: Lady of Allure

### **ganthet** (2009-06-02 11:50:09)

Corran listens to the plans that where being thrown around. The sneaking on board was good but the getting caught and being stuck on our own kind of sucked. The crash and smash idea was good to, but had it's own problems. "If we try to get on board, what do we pass are selves off as? Crew is easy, Passengers is another stroy we don't look like the type of people that would be on that ship. it would take time and credits for that."

Trin shrugs, figuring whichever method they use, Kyle is right and they should get moving. "Sounds good to me. Hey, Naroon, why don't you grab the sensor operator's seat on the Skipray? I think your skills are better suited to it than mine."
Collecting his medical bag and gesturing for Six to follow, he heads for the Skipray, sits down in the pilot seat and begins performing the preflight checklist.

Naroon simply shakes his head at Trin's comments.
*Well, if they want to go in guns a blazin', I won't ruin their fun.*
Through the visor, he sees a different world. He sees visual representations of the ship's systems and he checks over each one; engines, weapons, shields, environmental controls. Each one was represented to his eyes as a floating object in the visor, allowing him greater ease at examining them than through just code. Once he'd fun final checks on the systems, he turned to the side, hoping he wasn't pointed at the wall he couldn't see, "Ok folks, we're ready to go kill some of our lucrative hostages." The sardonic tone of his voice was unmasked.
Once the systems were checked out, Naroon tapped into the navicomputer to plot the best course. His breath caught for a second as the galaxy was displayed to him visually. All of the stars with their various colors swirled around the center of the galaxy. After a moment a few taps on the keyboard, the view zoomed in to their current position. A few more taps and the view zoomed out a bit till the target star system was also glowing. After a few moments, Naroon had plotted the course that he thought we get them there the quickest and safest. He also plotted the course to take them into the system on the other side of the star from their target, thus allowing them to use the sun's sensor shadow to make their approach.
"Ok, *captain*, I'm inputting the course to our hostage-situation-about-to-go-wrong, ... now. We're ready to go when everyone else is. Kyle, I've sent you the course I plotted too. See you there."

"Great, IÂ´ll plug it in and get going then. Once we get there, let me have a shot at talking to them, will you? Whoever they might think we are, the fact is that we are flying in crafts widely recognized as Imperial. While I hope our small numbers will keep them from blasting us on sight, TheyÂ´ll surely want an explanation"
He started to input the coordinates into the navicomputer, and waited for the Skipray to take off.

"Gee old man, you sure like to take the direct appouch." Corran laughs. He didn't really mind it. It was easier after all. "So we smash and grab huh? Sounds like fun. Of course I will be in the rear and waiting to patch your blaster wounds and set your bones." Corran relaxed in his seat and waited for the ship to take him to seen of his latest adventure.

Trin keys the comm system: "Kyle, you have no worries about us getting trigger happy. Talking our way aboard is exactly what we're hoping for. We'll follow your lead."
He sits back and sighs, keeping one eye on his boards and one eye on Medric's team as they board and strap in. "Look, Naroon, I understand your reservations, but think it through. First, if we can take a mobile spacedock without hurting anyone, we can take a liner without hurting anyone. Second, the last thing the crew wants is dead passengers, so they're basically on our side as far as that one little goal goes. Just relax and we'll execute our part of the plan when the time is right. Let's concentrate on getting aboard, first."
Lastly, he turns and cocks an eyebrow at Corran. "Who are you calling old, junior? You barely being able to grow chest hair doesn't make me old, it makes you a toddler. And you should know that age and treachery win out over youth and enthusiasm every time."
He glances around the interior of the ship, noting that everyone is strapped in, and turns back to his board with a grin. "Time to get a move on, folks." Bringing up power to the *Heart Attack's* repulsorlifts, he smoothly raises her off the deck of the hangar bay and guides her toward the stars.

Naroon hears what for him was the disembodied voice of Trin, since he was still wearing his visor. He nods his head slightly at the medic's comments about taking the prisoners alive.
"Ok, if you think that they'll be cooperative, then fine. Just remember that I'm not much good in a fight."

### **Alicia** (2009-06-05 16:15:16)

A few hours later the Skipray and TIE fighter are back in realspace. Naroon sees on the sensors that the system is empty of the Mon Cal luxury cruiser and it's escorts.
The system you have jumped into is in between two systems where the liner was to visit. One of the few locations where the ship would be traveling in realspace for an extended time. While the system is uninhibited the nebula provides a remarkable light show for the tourists passing through.

Corran wakes from his little nap when the Skipray reverts to normal space. "Hmm. must be at the target. I guess this where the fun begins." Corran strenches and readys himself for the task at hand. "Hey old man. You awake yet? I know guys at your age need there rest." Corran smiles at Trin and goes back to checking his gear. "So, we talk nice frist then if they try to run we jump on them and take the ship. Is that how we are handling this boss?" "Just so I know what is going on incase my services are needed." Corran is covering up his fear with bravdo. He is scared and that this could be the mission where he might die. If it was he was going to meet it with his eyes open and a simle.

Naroon, still looking through the visor and checking the sensors, puts out his little idea. "What if I jury-rig our ships to look like they're damaged. We could ask for assistance, claiming that we were attacked by pirates and left adrift. Or we could also say it was the Empire. Take your pick."

"Well, the inspection team bit might be enough to get us aboard. But you're right, there's not just the matter of the non-humans, there's the matter of one you being the only one with an Imperial uniform on. They'd be suspicious the moment any of the humans left the Skipray wearing civilian clothes, much less somebody like Medric. I like the traitors idea, though maybe we could say we were prisoners or slaves so they aren't expecting a bunch of former Imperials to spill out of the ship. We could say the Skipray is way overcrowded and the environmental systems are going to fail. We could combine that with Naroon's idea. A few blast marks and we have a reason to be here...say, they took out the hyperdrive on the Skipray, and when we jury-rigged it our repair came apart and dumped us here. "
"Wait, we may not need to do the blast marks. We can just say we had a run-in with the mass shadow of a stray asteroid and dropped into realspace in this system with a bad hyperdrive. We could even say we escaped the attack on Raxus Prime. That would give the story a kernel of truth and perhaps a bit of extra heft."

"Now now, I took out everything imperial about this flight suit long ago. But even so, believe me, I know the drills, and we donÂ´t make even near convincing inspection party. But yeah, try and make that Skipray look as battered up as it can get, thatÂ´ll lend some credibility to the story. IÂ´ll leave my ship alone, though.

Naroon nodded and took off the computer visor before getting up from the co-pilot seat. Walking to the back, he removed the panel and began to jury-rig the systems to make it look like the skipray's engines were barely working, as thought the mass-shadow had overloaded the hyperdrive motivator and that caused a blowback, overloading the system.

Trin makes sure that the shields are off (having them up would undermine their story) and unbuckles his restraints. He moves aft through the crowd of boarding party members ("pardon me...excuse me...sorry, old boy...pardon me") to the spacesuit locker. The door is flat against the aft bulkhead, with the bulk of the locker extending back into the engine compartment beyond. Opening it, he finds four basic spacesuits, gray with minimal white and black trim. *Imperials,* he thinks. *Even their spacesuits are drab.*
He dons the suit, and just before he dogs the helmet on he says to Naroon, "Care to join me outside? I have an idea or two and I think your skills will be more than helpful." Dogging the helmet and checking the suit carefully, he grabs the ship's repair kit, heads into the airlock ("pardon me...excuse me...sorry, old boy...pardon me"), cycles it and steps outside, magnetizing his boots and making his way toward the top of the left wing. For a moment he is transfixed by the view of the nebula behind them, staring at its beauty and listening to the rasping sound of his respirator equipment, and calls into the ship on the suit's comlink: "Magnificent view out here. It's almost worth the trip all by itself."
Attaching himself and his kit to an EVA lug, he kneels down and sets to work.

As Trin seemed to finish jury rigging the lighting to spark, Kyle and the pilot pick up what can only be the Mon Cal liner, *Lady of Allure* and its escorts, three dagger-class starfighters entering the system. Upon detecting you one of the fighters breaks off and flies toward you at top speed. The liner slows down along with the remaining two fighters, but they continue at a steady pace. Over the comm both the TIE and skipray receive an incoming message from the lone starfighter.

*Oh, bloody hell! Well, it's Kyle's job to sell it.* He headed inside as fast as he could go safely. He wanted to be back in the pilot seat by the time they had to either fight or limp over to the *Lady of Allure.*

"Copy that. Stand by." The frequency went silent for several moments. The liner and the escort fighters continued on their journey, steadily drawing closer.

Naroon takes off the visor in frustration and begins packing up his equipment. Best to be ready, just in case.
"Well, I guess I actually have to get on board to do this. **Frak!** So, Trin, we getting off blasters raised?"
Pulling out his own hold out blaster from it's sleeve holster, Naroon makes sure that it's charged and ready if he should need it. Replacing it, he gives one final check over to make sure that his computer, data pad, and visor are in his sack, his lectroticker was within easy access on his utility belt, and his two code cylinders were in his hip pocket.

Trin shakes his head. "No, we don't go in blasters raised, we talk. The main point of this little ruse was to get us aboard without a dogfight and turbolaser fire, but the longer we can keep it going the better. If we can get to engineering without firing a shot, that would be ideal."
He raises his voice: "Alright, Kyle's provided us with a good cover story, but we'll need to say the right things to sell it. We all look way too well-fed to be prisoners from Kessel, so if we're asked about it we need to say that we broke out while we were still at the starport waiting to be processed. And if you can make yourself look a little...well, scruffy looking, that wouldn't hurt." Taking his own advice, he musses his hair badly.

You maneuver the ships toward the service hanger deck where you were indicated to land. As you draw nearer a tractor beam from the *Lady of Allure* pulls you in the rest of the way.
In the bay you see several service oriented ships and another Dagger receiving maintenance. This small hanger deck apparently is not used by the guests of this luxury liner.

He gazes around the hangar bay, keeping an eye out for any liner crewmen who might be a welcoming committee. He also looks to see where the repair equipment is (since the damage they're supposedly fixing would be more than their small shipboard tool kit could handle) and ways they could slip away from the ship unnoticed and make it to engineering.

Once the two ships are landed in the hanger bay, they are approached by a mechanic flanked by two security personnel. Waiting at the bottom of the hatch for the crew to emerge.

We'll certainly make it good. Let me discuss it with the group."

Walking over to the being Trin had mentioned, Naroon extends a hand.
"Hi there. If you follow me, I can point out **exactly** what's wrong with the Skipray's hyperdrive."
Naroon starts walking towards the back of the skipray as soon as the fellow is following.
"Now, I haven't yet had a chance to look at the tie, but I hope to now that I've got an atmosphere to breath in."
Reaching the back of the skipray, Naroon pries one of the panels off.
"As you can **obviously** see, the prison base has no idea of how to properly maintain a hyperdrive engine. You can **clearly** see how the alluvial dampner has been hardwired into the fulstar plate. And, as any idiot with basic training in engineering knows, you **never** want to hardwire tha alluvial dampner into the fulstar plate. You run the risk of overloading the carbonite inserts and flooding the entire cabin with carbonite gas. Not fun at all, let me tell you. And, as you can see here, the flux capacitor connector has been connected to the hyperdrive core, **directly**. I mean, come on! What kind of an idiot would actually do this! They run the risk of stressing out the hyperdrive motivator. And I'm certain that a man of **your** intellect knows what happens then. Am I right? And don't even get me started on what they did to the ion exciter, the paralight system, and the transpacitor!
I mean! Come on! You'd think that we had Gamorreans working around in here from the crosswiring and misconnecting that's going on in this monstrosity. Now, don't you worry, none. I can get this beauty working just as well as the day it flew off the lot, which I'm sure your captain would be very happy about, assuming your captain decides to take payment in these ships for your benevolent rescue of ourselves. In fact, I'm pretty certain that if we were to head to engineering, your engineers would have the spare parts I'd need to get this beauty **and** that tie over there back up to factory specs, and probably a little more on top.
Just imagine how happy your captain would be if he found out that you had single-handedly negotiated for payment in these starships, and then on top of that, you told him that the ships you'd personally secured were in tip top shape and ready to be sold on the open market. Might that purchase us safe passage to the nearest star system?"

The two escorts remain outside moving toward a set of crates waiting to be moved into storage. They look around, apparently bored by the proceedings, but continue to observe the newcomers in case they may pose any threat. With the bay otherwise being fairly open it makes it hard to sneak out of the hanger bay without being spotted.
The mechanic follows Naroon into the ship and blinks at him as he finishes the tirade, proceeding to inspect the hyperdrive engine in detail. Reaching around Naroon, he checked the placement of a dozen wires. Apparently he's more interested in doing his job than caring about any sort of gain it might bring him.
"**Hmm yes, it appears we can easily get the parts you need to replace the necessary components. Should be enough to get you going again.**" Wiping his on a spare rag he pulls out a datapad he proceeds to jot down a couple notes. "**In the meantime, please make a list of anything you have to trade.**" Standing up straight he prepares to leave the skipray, but not before taking a good look around at the condition of the ship and its passengers.

"You're joking, right? Do you have **any** idea what happens in an ion exciter? Huh? Ions get excited, that's what! Now, our carbonite inserts in the skipray over there are all used up. Do you know what that means? Let me tell you. Without new carbonite inserts, the ion exciter won't stop exciting the ions! Next thing you know, the transpacitor is leaking hard polar radiation **all over this ship**!"
Naroon takes to waving his datapad around to emphasize his points.
"Is that what you want? Do you **want** hard polar radiation leaking all over this ship, killing everyone on board? I'm sure that would look **great** on the company reports. 'Two guards detained a mechanic trying to repair his vessel, doing their duties, but in the process allowed radiation to build up and kill everyone on board.' They'll put the medals on your graves! Now, this normally wouldn't be an issue as I could just place the order, but do you want to try and remember that I need a Bore 58PC95-Alpha carbonite insert? Huh? Is that what your captain wants?
"And don't even get me started on the fact that I'm also going to need Targ 31412DC-Gamma Fulsar Plate and a Hortz 469-3478 Flux Capacitor Connector. And, before you ask, no, nothing else is going to do the job. Now, if your captain wants to take these ships as our payment for the rescue, that's fine and dandy with me, but they're going to be in tip-top shape before he does so. I'm not going to have it on my mind that your captain got **cheated** out of good material because a couple of poodoo heads like yourselves got in my way.
"If you're worried about weaponary, don't be. I'm not carrying anything except this blaster pistol, which I'll happily turn over to you, **till I get back**. Does that make you feel better? Do you feel like letting me do my job and save all of our lives? Huh?"

Noticing that the guards were only on the doors that lead to the front and rears of the ship, Naroon nodded his head towards the door that the
techies had entered and started heading in that direction. While he walked, he wracked his brain, trying to figure out if there was ventilation shaft access in that room on a standard ship.

Corran hears the klaxons go off and thinks to himself that either they had figured out what was going or the hanger deck was about to be the last place he wanted to be. He starts to look around for the opening he needed an open dorr way to the rest of the sir anything that he might be able to use to his advantage.
*"Man, this is really turning into one of those days."*  He thinks as he looks for his opening.
((OCC: Preception +8 need to find the opening to the rest of the ship. If not will run back to the Skipray.))

Realizing that any ship that had not been secured to the ground would most likely be sucked out into space, Kyle skips grabbing his helmet from the fighter and instead gets into the cockpit. Pulling out his comlink, he opens a private channel to the other members of the group.
"OK guys, get back to your ships or hold on to something, or youÂ´ll be vacuumed. Seeing as the Skipray isnÂ´t secured here, IÂ´d suggest someone gets on board, or else thereÂ´ll be little point in repairing her. IÂ´ll go outside and take a look"
As he fires up his fighter, and prepares to leave the hangar, Kyle opens up a channel to the crew aboard the ship. While scanning the hangar opening for any kind of security fields or anything else that could severely impair his flight out, he speaks into his comm in a calm and relaxed tone, presenting a joking tone letting them know he wasnÂ´t overly serious.
"*Lady of Allure*, this is Kyle Manson from the hangar deck. Any particular reason you want to space me and my friends, or is there a malfunction somewhere? In that case we will be more than happy to assist with whatever needs be done"

Kyle recieves his answer quickly from the *Lady of Allure* "A radiation leak was reported by your engineer to be coming from the skipray, it would be recommended you and your friends secure yourselves accordingly."
The fighter can easily leave the hanger bay as the only thing between it and space is the force field currently in place, which serves to maintain the atmosphere in the bay while still allowing ships to leave and enter. Though you have the feeling it won't be up for much longer.

"Roger that. A warning would have been appreciated though, seeing as neither we nor our ships were prepared for a sudden loss of atmosphere. Do you mind if I take a swing outside while you fix things up in here? Pilot getting restless...you know the feeling"
Firing up his engines and leaving the hangar bay, Kyle has a bad feeling. Sure, their explanation sounds reasonable, but it seems weird to space a hangar bay because of a radiation leak. He tries to recall what he knows about standard procedures in the presence of a radiation leak.

Reaching the techie room, Naroon seals himself inside the door, hoping that it holds out against the depressurization method. Realizing where he was, he began to look around at the room he was in, wondering what was available for him to slice his way into.

*Bloody hell,* Trin thinks, dogging his helmet onto his spacesuit. He follows Naroon to the storage room.

Naroon and Trin enter the storage bay where the other techs who had been working in the hanger are waiting for the depressurization cycle to complete. They watch as Naroon and Trin take a good look around.
You see several crates of what appears to be spare parts grabbed from the cargo room for us in repairing the fighters you saw in the hanger. There's a computer console as well.
--------------------------------
Kyle is given the all clear to fly his TIE out of the hanger. Considering they believe the skipray is emitting radiation which may be harmful to their passengers, their actions are not completely strange. The leak could be fixed while the ship is a safe distance and the skipray could be brought back on board.

Naroon gets a look at the storage room with all the various spare parts, and does a quick head count of how many people are in the room with him and Trin. Looking over at Trin, Naroon lightly nods his head towards the techies.
"Doctor, maybe you could explain to the gents here about the joys of oxygen deprivation resultant from depressurization?"
*Trin, can you keep them busy, or at least stun them so I can go ahead and access the computer?*

Well out of the hangar, Kyle figures he might be overly worried. While he is still out there though, he figures he might as well take a look around the ship from the outside. Plus, itÂ´s always nice to get some fly time. Swooping around the *Lady of Allure*, he tries to spot anything unusual about the ship.

"A fine idea, my friend, but I'm more concerned about decompression sickness. Even a slight leak in a door seal or spacesuit can be enough to cause it. You see, as the pressure goes down, nitrogen bubbles form in your blood and get caught in the joints, causing agonizing pain and a host of other problems. Let's see, there's..."
Trin goes on to describe in ghoulish detail the horrible effects of the bends, beginning with the agonizing joint pain and moving on to maddening itching and the sense that thousands of insects are crawling all over the victim, dizziness and nausea leading to vomiting (here he includes a graphic sidebar on vomiting in a spacesuit or other helmet), seizures, loss of bladder and bowel control, paralysis and brain damage. He throws in accounts of patients (some real, some made up) that suffered from symptoms like this, but he never describes the way these patients were (or would be) treated, so the techs get to hear about all the horror and none of the cure. When he discusses brain damage he mentions the oxygen deprivation that Naroon brought up, and does his best to get every tech thinking that any moment they could become a drooling vegetable because of a leaky door seal. And is there a slight whistling sound somewhere in the room...the kind a leaky seal would make?
He also gestures a lot with his left hand, helping the graphic descriptions along, He keeps his right hand close to his pistol holster, ready to draw and stun the techs at the first sign of trouble. He stands in a lecturer's stance, so that the use of one hand (the right is resting on his suit's utility belt) looks natural.

Naroon steps forward, nodding with Trin's descriptions.
"Don't you guys have a way out of this room? A ventilation shaft or something else that will get you to a safer part of the ship? What about computer access from here? We could check and see how long they're going to vent the hangar bay, or make sure that the seals for this room are secure at the very least."

The techs glance at each other. The older techs seem to roll their eyes at Trin's narrative while a younger tech seems rather anxious. One of the techs says to Naroon rather nastily. "If you are so worried, why don't you go back to your ship." It's not so much a question as a statement. They are apparently not happy with the arrival of the two men.
Trin and Naroon notice that Corran and the other boarders have not made their way to the supposed safety of the cargo bay.
Over an intercom a mechanical voice indicates there is 1 minute left till the hanger is depressurized.
As Kyle flies in formation with the Lady of Allure, not spotting anything unusual for a luxury liner his sensors begin to register a series of ships coming into the sector. The imperial sensors registering the transponders as hostile. On closer examination Kyle can see they are registered to the new Republic. A squad of X-wings are escorting a Mon Calamari Cruiser. As it draws closer another two squads launch from the cruiser and begin spreading out to sweep the area. The original squad the cruiser continue moving toward the Allure.

"You really should listen to your doctor," Trin says. He draws his heavy blaster pistol and points it at the techs. "Here's some more health advice: If you want to stay healthy, you'll put your hands on your heads and get down on your knees."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-06 19:49:53)

As his sensors suddenly starts to beep, Kyle notices several ships leaving hyperspace. As he looks closer, he notices that it is a Mon Calamari cruiser with escorts. At first, he only considers the ramifications this will have on their mission, but soon makes an even more urgent realization and quickly clicks his comm, hailing the new arrivals.
"New Republic ships, this is Kyle Manson flying a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor. I just want to inform you that I am not a hostile, so please do not blast me out of the sky, even though I probably show as an enemy on your screens. Me and my companion ship, a Skipray Blastboat was merely picked up by the *Lady* to perform some repairs"
After closing the comm, he took out his personal comlink and hailed his companions back on the ship.
"Uhm guys, just so you know, we have company. IÂ´m good, but I canÂ´t handle a Mon Cal with escorts on my own"

Naroon looked at Trin with a smile. He went to reach for his own blaster pistol, only to find that he'd forgotten that he'd let it be taken by one of those thugs for guards. Instead he pulled out a roll of mesh tape and began taping up any of the techs that surrendered themselves.
