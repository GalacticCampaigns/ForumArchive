# [Heart Of Shadows] Chapter 1

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-02 21:30:55)

Your long journey from space has brought you here into the main lobby of the Telares point station. It's a space station currently orbiting Tatooine. After a particuraly tedious customs inspection at a docking bay, you have walked the halls to emerge into a breathtaking sight. You see the main lobby of the station ahead of you. The lobby is full of different species and genders alive with conversation at the prospect of making credits. Some of these people have divided into groups. One of the groups looks populated by clean, regal looking people. The other groups seem to have gritty, ruthless types, probably armed with various illegal weaponry. The entire lobby of the station is composed of a silver, reflective steel material that gives the whole room a royal look. In the center of the lobby, is a wonderful atrium with lush, tall trees that are basking in simulated sunlight projected from a holoprojector hundreds of feet away at the top of the station. You would not even be able to tell you are in space unless you just got off a ship. Around this atrium, there appears to be small gray tables that could comfortably host two people for a drink and a discussion. Indeed, there are many space-worn travelers resting and sharing drinks with jovial laughter and solemn chats. This lobby seems quite expansive for a space station, it looks too luxurious. Beyond the atrium however, there seems to be various rooms lined up in an circular manner to accomodate the lobby's shape. They have well-lit signs above them with representatives standing outside of each entry way.
If you understand Basic; the signs read "AQUARIUM", "GALAXY PET STORE", "DERAK'S WARES", "STAR TEAR's CANTINA",
and "VANDIO's DROIDS". The places seem pretty lifeless, except for the Star Tear's cantina, which seems to have people flowing into it. One individual definitely stands out from the rest, a person in raggy clothing is sleeping right up against a tree trunk in the atrium. You notice an Ithorian approaching the atrium.

Awne steps into the open expanse of the lobby, her bright blue eyes drinking in the beautiful area. Her tail twitchs at the awe she's feeling trying to find something to compare this place to and finding none in her memory. The 21 year old Farghul bounces slightly on her feet as she looks around at the stores, her tail waving excitedly now by her ankles. Finally deciding to head into Deraks Wares.
Awne crosses the area, looking around at the other races, her tail careful to not hit anyone, and gazing up at the trees and wanting very much to climb; 'Laterr' she promises herself and and smiles as she crosses into the store. She tugs slightly on her fingerless gloves making them tighter on her hands. She looks around at what the store has to offer mentally counting how many credits she has left.

When Awne walks into the door, she notices it's a sharp contrast in difference in what you saw in the lobby. The room is quite small, and it would only take you about twelve steps to get to the end of the room. The whole room is a drab, gray color that is brightly lit and appears to be very clean. There is a counter on your left with a small computer interface embedded on the surface. Behind the counter, there is a display case well-lit with various types of weapons mounted on the wall. They appear to be various melee and ranged types. To your right, there are shelves made from plasteel. The shelves hold items packaged and well-organized, the items seem to be made for spacers. There are various tool kits, security kits, ammunition packages, and many other things used for repairing/maintaining starships. At the end of the room, there are many gray plasteel bins, probably to hold other supplies not ready to be sold. Awne notices quickly that no one is in this store.
If you were a conniving person, you would be tempted to take an item from the store.
*You could make a Knowledge Tactics check to identify the weapons on the wall. Or make a Perception check to notice any security measures if you want to steal.*

Woroken enters the lobby, and immediately compares it to some of the cramped trading ships on which he had recently been spending his time. This was much better. The moutain of a wookie, so to speak--large, muscular, and unkempt with black and brown fur stood out in particular contrast to the group of, what Woroken assumed were nobles from various galaxies. He quickly passing by that group, which he noted, with a laugh had no one carrying a bowcaster, like he was. For some strange reason, a brief vision of a foppish noble attempting to carry such a large weapon, and teetering to the groud ran through his mind.
Brushing past the second group as well, Woroken figured he would head to the cantina and grab a drink before the meeting, assuming there was to be a meeting, would begin. Before entereing, something caught Woroken's eye, and for some reason, a person sleeping against a tree caught his attention, as he wondered how someone could sleep with all the action going on. Very interesting. He decided to take a quick look at the figure before going to the cantina, and proceeded in the direction of the sleeping figure. The cantina would be there all day, after all.

As the young adult human male steps into the lobby of the shiny steel station, he pulls the hood of his all-temperature cloak further forward, trying his best to hide his face and strawberry blonde hair from prying eyes. Normally, a person like him dressed in fringer's clothings with a blaster holstered at the hip would not attract any attention in this particular system, but this 19-year-old was none other than Radon Antila who, though a native of Tatooine, was a famous podracer-turned-action star. Although he had already gotten used to fame and glory during his racing career, the glamor of show business had been another thing entirely. His brief time in the Core as the media's new darling in the holovid "On Racer's Edge" had instilled in him the glaring need for disguises, and to always be on the lookout for rabid fans wanting autographs or a photo opportunity.
Still, as his heterochromatic eyes scanned the place, he felt a sense of peace. This was, after all, home - or at least as near to it as he could get for the moment. Soon, he would head down to the desert planet, but for now, the all but tiring trip in hyperspace meant that rest was in order. Having read the signboards posted around the atrium, he hesitated going to the cantina as surely, he thought, someone was bound to recognize him in there. However, it had been a while since he had a meal he would consider tasteful, and the thought of a relatively nicer meal, as compared to what he'd been having on the way, overrode his thoughts of evading notice. He hoped he looked non-descript enough as he made his way to Star Tear's.

Woroken approaches the atrium, and as he does, he turns a few heads noticing his hulking appearance, a few of the bellicose types throw a few nods of respect at the weapon he carries and his stature, and the cleaner types appear indifferent. The person sleeping seems to have well-worn clothes, with rips and tears throughout, he seems to have gotten dirty in the mulch of the atrium..he appears to be sleeping soundly. However...
*Woroken, please make a perception check for me.*

Awne sighs not seeing anyone who can help her in the store and decides to wait a while else where and check back later. She leaves the store and heads to the Atrium intent on relaxing in the tree's she was admiring.
Awne reaches the trees and looks up purring softly as her tail moves with happiness. Not seeing any branches low enough to grab, she grins and lets her claws come out. quickly and careful she scales the tree using her tail for balance and her claws to help her move up the trunk of the tree to a branch. Grabbing hold of it with both hands she swings her legs forward then quickly back using the momentum and a push from her arms to jump up unto the next branch. Not feeling like going too high she settles on this second branch, her tail extending over the side of the branch, curling and uncurling in a relaxed manner. She leans her back against the trunk and crosses her ankles over eachother in front of her. Awne fixes her short skirt smoothing out the wrinkles and moves a piece of her hair out of her eyes. Happy, she looks up and around at those below her.

A man in a velvet colored suit and a yellow cloak notices Radon.
"Look! It's Radon Antila, the famous podracer!!! The future movie star!!!"
Everyone in the lobby looks surprisingly in the direction of the shout, and slowly a group begins to form around Radon. Radon hears indistinct talking and mentions of autoprints throughout the crowd. People start moving datapads toward Radon.

Awne's ear twitchs towards the sound of commotion looking in the direction and wondering why so many people are crowding around. She shrugs not thinking much of it and looks down to where she saw the wookiee and the man under the tree.

Awne easily and gracefully climbs the tree to the second branch. She moves in such a manner that it seems professionally done and by animal instincts. You can see the whole crowd and all the shops easily.

After noticing the commotion, people begin to file and a few, stumble out of the cantina towards the crowd. You predict that it won't take long before everyone knows there is a podracing star on the station.

Despite his effort at trying to conceal his identity, apparently someone in the crowd had managed to discover his true identity. In hindsight, he thinks it would've been easier to just come in person and say he was an impersonator, but then again who's to say it wouldn't have ended up the same. He sighed in resignation, and as there was no point trying to hide his face anymore, he slowly, purposefully lowered his hood, revealing himself. Almost immediately, his winning smile flashed, and he looked with humble gratitude at the crowd, saying, "Yeah, it's me. Guess I've got a thing or two to learn about disguises."
He spied the wave-like motion of datapads heading his way like a Mon Calamari tsunami, and realized that that actually scared him more than the idea of being identified all across the station. Hoping to stop the onslaught, even for the shortest of whiles, he swept his hands around politely and declared, "Please, everyone, I've just come from the Core. Allow this man some time to properly dine first. You don't expect me to be able to do any signing on an empty stomach now, do you?"

Bennosuke enters the lobby. He is a young man, thin with blue eyes and dark black hair. He is dressed in ratty clothes and carries with him two large suitcases. He moves warely through the lobby. He has never been in a space station before, or even off world for that matter, and everthing seems very new and strange. Having lived on tatooine his whole life he is uncomfortable. Even his all tempurature cloak can't keep him warm.
Bennosuke knows he needs to find a place to stay, or some credits to get a place to stay, so he heads to the cantinna, hoping to find someone who might be able to help him. If nothing comes to mind when he gets in, he wholes up in a secluded booth in the cantina, and sits down, making sure he has a good view of the enterance, and puts one suitcase next to him, (towards the wall) and unlaches it without opening (ooc it has his blaster carbine in it set on stun) and watches the going ons in the cantina.

Vor'en sets in the cantina guarding his latest clinet. Having a drink and watching for anyone that might look like they are going to interuped his bosses dealings. His one eye scaning the bar and the outside court yard, cigar in his mouth and the drink in his hand.
Needless to say he looks out of place. Like he should be stroming a fortress instead of guarding some crime lord but it is what pay the bills. He thinks to himself *" I hope this doesn't take much longer, The longer we are here the easyer it is to get found."*.

*Woroken's perception check is d20 + 6, for your roll DW.*
As Woroken approaches the sleeping humanoid, he hears murmur from the gathered masses. Radon Antila, the holovid star was at the station, as well. "Small galaxy," Woroken says outloud to no one in particular. Of course, Woroken suspected few, if any of the gathered, understood shriwook. It also surprised the wookie, that the man sleeping still did not stir, even with the crowd's palpable excitement and ensuing noise after recognizing Radon.

*Persuasion D20+7=27, and you gain 50 experience.*
As Radon speaks it seems as if his silver tongue is bearing it's full might. Because after your statement, a sporadic chorus of agreements can be heard throughout the crowd as they begin to thin out to what they were previously doing. Some people in the group even make sure that everyone leaves you alone by directing the flow of the large group away from you. It would seem that fame definitely has its price, if you don't like overwhelming attention. However, as the crowd dissipates, you notice a lone female standing tall and proud. She is wearing a tan blast vest over a white-long sleeve shirt, with navy-blue trousers that tuck into her tall black boots. On the woman's thigh you notice a blaster holster with a pistol you can't quite identify. She has striking features to her face with green eyes, and she has short, pink-styled hair. The woman appears to be jealous yet unimpressed that Radon had quite the gathering. She turns, giving you the cold shoulder, and walks toward the cantina.
*Perception 10+6=16, and you gain 50 experience.*
At the atrium, Woroken turns a scrutinous eye to what appears to be a homeless man. His senses are keen enough to notice that he isn't sleeping, but he is peeking his eyes just a bit to see what's going on around him. You wonder what you should do next with the man as he is faking rest.
In the Star Tear's cantina, you notice the room is of very low light. The only light in the facility is on the bar, and there are multicolored lights on the gambling tables in the center of the room. A holovid is projecting podraces at the end of the room. You assume that they make their bets at the table, and watch the results on the huge projector. A silver-skinned protocol droid is aligning bottles at the bar, and his servomotors begin to churn frantically with noise as he sees a mass of returning patrons. Perhaps he thought he would get a break with the visiting podrace star. The patrons return to the bar and start demanding drinks, the others go back to their respective tables and start throwing down credits. No one has taken any mind of Bennosuke or Vor'en, as their seems to be a lot to occupy the masses. The woman that had just left Radon's presence strides into the cantina, and looks curiously towards Vor'en's direction.
*Vor'en, if you have anything you wish to hide, please make your stealth and deception checks.*

Woroken is now clearly interested in the homeless person pretending to be sleeping in the midst of the busy gathering. Could the person be up to trouble or was he just an interested observer not wanting to be noticed? The wookie decided to give a brief nod of acknowledegment to the homeless person, walking near and nodding as his large frame passed by the slightly open eyes of the "sleeper." Woroken did not speak as he did not wish to give away to any nearby observers what he had realized about the sleeper, or lack of sleeping thereof.

Awne watching as the wookiee moves closer to the sleeping man, and the crowd dispursing feels curiosity getting the better of her. Wanting to go to the Cantina and find out what all the excitment was about but very curious why the wookiee hadn't left the man alone yet. Deciding she could always go to the Cantina later she moves slowly on her branch and onto the one beside her, moving quietly from branch to branch trying to get close enough to see better and hear better.

*Awne's Stealth 2+4=6 Woroken's Perception 6+7=13 Awne's Climb= 18+6=24, Woroken you gain 50 experience points.*
The sleeping man decides to sit up after he seems to have been caught. You can notice his facial features now, he seems to be a middle-aged, gruff looking individual with a shaggy brownish/gray beard. His hair is dirty-blonde/gray and it is currently a mess.
Sleeping man: "Hello there, is there anything I can help you with?"
Just when it looks like Woroken and the man will exchange information, a rustling is heard in the leaves, and it sounds if a branch is breaking. Woroken's keen wookiee instincts seem to notice the distraction before it's almost audible though. The man notices Woroken's change in attention and acrobatically recovers to his feet, and it looks like he is reaching for a weapon, but he freezes his hand just above his hip. He looks at Woroken with concern.
Sleeping man: "Time to get to the point, why are you watching me?"
Close to the atrium, you have managed to gain the attention of the ithorian who seems to be working on a computer terminal right in front of the trees.
Meanwhile, the pink-haired lady has her full attention on Vor'en's dealings. She is now approaching the area where he is. All the other patrons seem to clear the way for the woman.
At this moment, all the noises in the station cease and you hear a musical chime, signaling a message on the public sound system.
Protocol Droid: "On behalf of Falsoor Research, we'd like to extend a warm welcome to all our visitors. We hope you are enjoying all our facilities, and we do not wish to take up any more of your time when all parties could be doing business. That being said, Representative Elsik will be out in one hour to discuss plans for work and dealings that need to be done. Please be careful when you get on your dreadful starships, and that will be all."
The message is repeated in a dozen or so more languages, then the music and festivities continue again, seeming to not have phased any of the patrons drinking and gambling activities. **SLAM!** The pink haired woman is now staring into the eyes of Vor'en, both fists dug into the table.
Pink-haired lady: "Hi there handsome, are you doing business in my territory and not giving me a share of the profits? I want in."
She says this very flirtaciously, and awaits for Vor'en's response.

Woroken, slightly taken aback by the gracefulness and quickness of the man's rise to his feet from a prone position, replies to the query, in shriwook. "Seemed pretty strange to be catching a nap in the middle of this crowd. I wanted to make sure you were alright, and wern't in neeing any medical attention. Name's Woroken, and as it looks like I have about an hour to kill, I am heading to the cantina. First rounds on me, if you want to join me."
Woroken knew very well about the language barrier he normally faced. Expecting the man to not understand, anything the wokie just explained, Woroken made a vague, hopefully nonthreatening gesture with his hands, indicating he was not reaching for a weapon, and pointed toward the cantina, just in case.

"Very interesting," thought Woroken, "there is much more to this man than it first seemed." An understanding of shriwook as well as amazingly quick reflexes led the wookie to the conclusion that Woroken wanted to learn a bit more about this fellow. A round of drinks would be a small price to pay to get some more information...
As Woroken's attention had not been focused on the tree, the wookie turns to look closer.

Points in the direction of the rustling leaves on the tree, you easily spot a Farghul with feline-like eyes peering directly at you two. It is apparent that she was attempting to eavesdrop on you both.

Woroken informs the sleeping man that he has no idea who the Farghul is in shriwook.
Turning *upwards, I assume*to face the Farghul, Woroken motions for her to come out of the tree and join the two of them. No reason to yell over the crowd of people, if it could be helped, Woroken thought. And she's probably heard everything we have said so far anyway.
"Perhaps you should do the talking," the wookie tells the sleeping man. "Unless of course, you speak shriwook..." Woroken said alound, turning again to face the Farghul.

Even Radon himself is amazed as his persuasiveness. He almost doesn't believe that the crowd is dispersing itself, and even making an unobstructed way into the cantina for him. Of course, that merely serves to highlight the one person who didn't look like she was a fan, and despite his burning desire to stay as private as possible, he finds it practically impossible not to think of the lady. He finally decides to enter the cantina with another purpose in mind - to find out just who this attention-seeking woman was.
However, his honed Tatooine instincts tell him that discretion would be the better option as against going up to the woman and directly introducing himself; after all, having been in his share of trouble down in Mos Espa, it's always suspicious when cantina patrons make way for someone in a manner of avoidance. So instead, he slowly makes his way into the cantina and heads directly for an empty spot at the bar, ordering a nice, hot meal as he tries to chat up the barkeep and other nearby patrons with a casual, light-hearted query: "Who's the woman with the pink hair? She seems almost as famous as me around here."

Blowing smoke in her face and not looking at all worried that she might be trouble.Vor'en looks at her with his one good eye and says."Beat it, I am not interested in picking up xtra baggage." " I am a simple working stiff like you, so if you have bussiness the boss is right over there maybe he can pencil you in." Taking another look at her agian. " I don't have time so make like the sands and blow."

*The meal costs you five credits. Gather information 7+2=9 +2 circumstance bonus for being famous around Tatooine. You gain 50 experience points.*
Radon asks around the bar, the barkeep, and a few patrons. They refuse to reveal any information themselves. However, they point to the droid bartender. He happily attempts to answer your question.
Protocol Droid: "Greetings Sir, how may I be of service? Oh the pink haired lady? That is Mistress Ordenn Rann. She is known to smuggle black market items from Bordo the Hutt to people that live around these parts. She's been particularly successful in a fledgling settlement called Mos Esre. There are rumors that the mayor of that settlement is losing power though, and Ordenn is captializing with the decay of order. High-powered weaponry has been in demand for self-defense as Bordo's thugs are slowly taking over the area. Also, we've heard that that Republic forces have occupied Mos Esre for reasons they deem strictly confidential. It is interesting, but many people would wonder why the Republic is wandering out in the Outer Rim."
The Droid and Radon look over to Ordenn's table as she is talking to Vor'en.
Ordenn Rann: "Fine by me, but you should be a little nicer if you expect to be a good businessman. But hey, if it works for you...so be it. I don't think you realize who you've turned down...it's ok little one...you'll learn."
Ordenn walks away frustrated toward the gambling tables, she demands a drink and sits next to the other patrons. She blends right in with the rough crowd as one of the boys. She begins cheering and slinging credits around for her favorite podracer.
The bartender points one more thing out to Radon about Ordenn.
Protocol Droid: "She's also been known to have quite the weakness for gambling."

*"A black marketeer! That explains a lot,"* Radon thought to himself. Surprising as this was, he found himself more surprised to hear not only of the foundation of a new settlement, but also the occupation of it by the New Republic - all of which somehow happened in the time since he left for his movie career. The last one was particularly interesting: was the NR moving to bring Tatooine in? Personally, he had mixed feelings about that. Order was something lawless planets like his needed, but he knew that as far as Outer Rim natives were concerned, the Empire and the Republic differed only by the uniforms of their soldiers.
"Fine by me, but you should be a little nicer if you expect to be a good businessman. But hey, if it works for you...so be it. I don't think you realize who you've turned down...it's ok little one...you'll learn," Radon hears Ordenn Rann saying to a tough looking man across the cantina. Whoever that blasterjock was, he either knew exactly what he was doing, or was simply asking for it. Radon himself would've feigned intimidation just to get out of such a situation. He'd seen too many blasters drawn from such 'conversations', where one of the parties ended up dead for overestimating their bravery.
He relives his memories just for a while before he hears the droid say, "She's also been known to have quite the weakness for gambling."
"Is that right?" he replies, glancing momentarily at the podrace they were betting on. He finishes his meal, having thoroughly enjoyed it much more than the food he ate on the startransport he used to get here. All the while, he contemplates on whether or not to go up and introduce himself despite the danger, then decides that voluntarily associating himself with a known criminal would be a public relations disaster. Still, if he wanted to stay out of trouble, he needed to be on Ordenn Rann's good side, but he had to do it without arousing suspicion. What he needed to do, he concluded, was to get himself invited.
Radon leans over the counter, and put up a few credits. He tells the droid, "Would you mind giving Ms. Rann my regards with a glass of her usual drink?"

Awne curses softly under her breathe as she fells the branch begin to break, moving quickly to stronger part before it gave way. She notices the wookiee's gesture to come down from the tree and sighs, climbing down to the lower branchs stopping briefly to blink at the wookiee when he spoke seemingly to her, not understand a word he said.
She quickly makes her way to the floor and smoothes the shirt and skirt, tugging on her gloves slightly. Her tail waves gently by her feet showing her slight confusion. She turns to the human her blue eyes blinking as she motions to the wookiee "What'd he say?"

Vor'en laughs at the display. Thinking to himself*" All talk. Just keep flashing them creds around and you will atrack the wrong kind of people."* Vor'en opens up his comlink to check with his employer.
After he finds out an e.t.a he finishes his drink and heads to the front to wait for him. Keeping a eye out for anyone else whothinks they are going to get in his face. Saying to himself " I can't understand why people cannot keep to them selves there is enuf to go around without getting into someone elses." " Sometimes life was easyer when I was a Stromtrooper." " Man I wish that guy would hurry up.' Vor'en says kind of ierateed.

*Ben, Vor'en, Woroken, Radon, and Awne all receive 50 experience points for participating on the board. This represents that you've gotten to know the locals better and learned a bit more about the space station.*
The wookiee, farghul, and the raggedy-dressed human all stand in front of the atrium, trying to get a bearing on their situation. As they are talking, a greenish-skinned ithorian in a silverish work uniform stands next to them, looking as if he wants to get in on the conversation.
Orwen Gered: "Hi there. This wookiee was asking about my condition, and stating that he'd like to share a drink with me. He wanted me to talk to you and ask what you were doing crawling around the atrium. By the looks of our ithorian friend, Derak. You may have upset him by climbing the trees he looks after."
Just as the ithorian is about to speak, a person dressed in a similiar uniform as the ithorian passes by your group. He is a short, pudgy, and balding man with a brown beard. He definitely has an arrogant stride to him as he pays no attention to the people conversing in front of the atrium. He appears to have no weapons, and you derive that the uniform is probably the uniform of the Falsoor organization. It looks as if he is dead set to go into the cantina.
Orwen Gered: "That would be Elsik. How about we all go get a table and listen to what he has to say, and we will have a talk?"
Back in the cantina, Radon is having a chat with the Bartending droid as the place is remaining lively. Ben sits quietly at his table, minding his own business, and the patrons of the bar seem not to even notice him. They are probably either too intoxicated or have other worries to pay him any mind. As Radon suggests a drink, the Protocol droid recommends...
Protocol Droid: "Your regards? Splendid! I know just the thing for Mistress Rann. Sir, and might I add if you were a protocol droid you would do well at it, you definitely know how to use your pleasantries. Let's see, if my processors serve me correctly, she prefers a Fuzzy Ewok."
*Deduct 3 credits Radon.*
The droid whips out a bottle, and as he does...his index finger and thumb pop right off. The droid embarrasingly finishes pouring a sparkling bronze liquid into a small glass. He seems quite humilated for a droid, and signals for the barkeep to come pick up the drink.
Protocol Droid: "My apologies sir, it has been a good while since I've gotten some decent maintenance."
The droid picks up his fingers and places them under the bar, he begins wiping down the bar to make it a bit cleaner. Radon sees the barkeep deliver the drink to Ordenn as she is gambling. Ordenn stops what she is doing and looks in Radon's direction, she signals for him to come near her.
The music cuts off abruptly in the cantina, and all the lights come on. Elsik Rydar is now standing at the end of the cantina, using a posture as if he somehow demands attention.
Elsik Rydar: "Good evening everyone, on behalf of Falsoor Research I'd like to welcome you. For those who seek credits, there are lots to be made. To those who have questions, we will give you an answer...."
*Everyone please state what you are doing as Elsik begins his announcements.*

Awne looks between the Wookiee and the ragged human as the human explains what the wookiee was saying. She nods her head in understanding grins at the thought of a drink her tail flicking at the thought.
"A drrink hm?" She thinks about this for a moment before realizing there was another question asked "Ah..why was I crrawling arround the trrees? Well...the storre overr therre" she points to Derek's "Had no one in it to help me, so I thought I'd kill sometime and rrest in these trrees. It's been awhile since I've rrested like this." She turns to the Ithorian "Terribly sorrrry if I upset you, they arre rreally beautiful trrees."
Awne looks to where the human looks seeing the other person heading to the cantina, "Elsik hm? A drrink sounds wonderrful, eitherr way I'll be seeing you in the Cantina, parrdon me" She smiles, her sharp teeth showing as her tail flicks. Awne leaves the group in quick strides to the cantina, her ears twitching trying to catch what the man is saying.

You look around the cantina, hoping to find some hint as how to make some credits. The only thing you really see is credits piled over some tables, the patrons are partially watching them, as most of their attention is focused on Elsik.
It occurs to you that you could start asking for work after the announcement, as you did just see a crime lord.

"Well Ordwen, let's see about that drink I promised you..." the wookie says to the human. "Hopefully we can get some service before this Elsik begins speaking," he says as the walk into the busy cantina. "If you would order for us, I'll take care of the tab. And what's the deal with that Farghul anyway?" Woroken made a mental note that he was going to have to buy a vox box, when the opportunity presented itself. With that, he entered the busy cantina...

*Awne doesn't need to make a perception check, as the announcement is also being heard throughout the station with the public sound system.*
Orwen, Woroken, Derak, and Awne all walk into the cantina listening to Elsik speak his business. They enter the cantina as discreetly as possible, trying to not take any attention away from the public speaker. All four of you sit at a table, Orwen orders 4 Hothan Ice's, which is politely declined by Derak. The drink is returned quickly by the barkeep, it is a bright blue liquid, with dry ice teeming out of the glass. As the drink hits your tongue, it has a refreshing cool, yet intoxicating sweet taste.
*Deduct 9 credits Woroken.*

Awne takes a seat her tail moving to her side to trail off the seat and flick by her ankle, out of the way of anyone else. Her attention is turned to Elsik as he speaks though her ear twitchs as a drink is set before her, smiles "Thanks" she says and raises the glass looking at the liqued, not familier with it.
Awne looks at it curiously, bringing it close to her and takes a sniff, seeing as it doesn't offend she gingerly dips her tounge into the liqued lapping up a small amount to taste it. Her ears perk up, her tail twitchs higher for a moment at the pleasent taste and her whole face lights up; a small purr of enjoyment can be heard by those around her and she takes another lap at it before taking a sip. A few louder purrs emit from the farghul, though she doesn't seem to care as she turns her attention back to the gentleman speaking, lapping at her drink slowly to savor it.

Elsik Rydar is pacing around a bit the front of the cantina as he speaks. The manner he speaks, it would seem he isn't very comfortable as a public speaker. All the patrons glare intently at him, they are figuratively burning holes through him like lightsabers through plasteel. It would appear to you that just like a scientist, he doesn't make his way out of the lab station much.
Elsik Rydar: "As some of you may heard, Falsoor is a very unorthodox, yet successful, scientific organization. We trace our foundings to five years ago, from a partnership between Luceen Elseior and a man named Corlen Doris. Corlen Doris was a senator in the New Republic who left with a vision, a vision that one day the secrets and problems of our galaxy would be understood. Luceen was a brilliant scientist who has been working in the living sciences since he was a teenager, he has done many projects with the ithorians on Ithor to study life and ecology. Together, these two minds have formed the foundations of our organization, and thus far we have been very stable and successful. They wanted to understand our galaxy to improve the quality of living for everyone that resides in the galaxy, and that has become our company's goal. Corlen Doris is the headmaster of this space station. This place is our mobile headquarters, we meet people who wish to support our efforts as we orbit their planet. Our current campaign has us studying hostile and dangerous creatures who cannot coincide with others living around them. We seek to know what drives these creatures, so perhaps we could help them coexist with calmer creatures. We have been to many planets looking for these answers. Our quest has brought us to Tatooine."
He takes a brief moment to pause, and continues talking...some of the rougher patrons seemed to be getting bored already.

Awne raises an eyebrow at the announcement, wondering when this nervous man will starting talking about why it was requested so many mercenaries and such come here...as well as how much they're planning to pay.
Awne's tail flicks up by her side as she thinks, she lifts the glass of her drink to her lips and looks around at the others in the cantina seeing how many seedy and professional types she'll need to compete with for the reward that's sure to come.

### **Dreamwalker** (2007-11-04 19:58:23)

*Woroken's Perception 5+6=11, Awne's Perception 5+19=24*
As the four people sit at the table drinking their Hothan Ice's, Woroken and Awne begin scanning the room. Awne easily spots many different potential mercenaries, warriors, and rugged spacers. She notices that most of them seemed to be armed to the teeth, and if she was to compete with them, she might have her work cut out for her.
Woroken notices that Awne is looking around curiously, he does the same. To Woroken's sight, he can count there are at least a hundred people in attendance here, maybe more. He spots one tough looking wookiee with darker, brownish fur...he is wearing nothing but a heavy-silver bowcaster on his back that is very shiny. The wookiee is sitting with two other Duros space pilots and he is watching the proceedings carefully.
Elsik Rydar: "So, without a doubt, many of you wonder why we have issued a call out to you. Credits may be your driving factor, but also know this, you are going to be involved with what I believe will change things in the galaxy permanently. You could be a part of history. The things you do now may put great impact on the future, your skills are deeply needed. Your task is to travel to the surface of Tatooine, and participate in a hunt for all hostile indigenous life. These creatures will be captured by non-lethal means, and they shall not be harmed in any way. Any person who does not comply is severing your connection with Falsoor, and you may never work for us again. You will be paid 10,000 credits for every specimen you turn into the Falsoor department on Tatooine, and 1,000 credits for every specimen after that."
The cantina bursts out with conversation as everyone is discussing this statement with their friends... smiles begin to grow on the faces of the tougher people. A middle-aged human dressed in a prestine white-ambassador uniform stands.
Middle-aged diplomat: "How can Falsoor, a scientific branch, afford the acquistion of specimens with these funds? Who funds this operation?"
Some of the rougher patrons tell him to shut up, or to be quiet...he causes quite an uproar. The man dressed in white ignores the statements and awaits an answer.
Elsik Rydar: "This brings me to my next point. Those who are here to conduct an investigation on Falsoor's alleged unethical research, you will be able to deliberate with Headmaster Doris in his discussion chamber within the hour. He will happily answer any questions you may have...then you can travel to Tatooine with the rest of the members of this operation to inspect our facilities, and our methods."
Diplomat: "Very well."
Elsik Rydar: "It's settled then, the transport will leave first thing in the morning. If you are participating in the hunt, please have your datapad upload all the information you'll need out of one of the terminals around the station. You will be permitted to load your cargo onto our transport on Docking Bay 5 at any time one hour prior to launch. We have plenty of rooms available for your stay...please use the map on any terminal to find your way. For organizational purposes, you will be given an ID number on your datapad and you must travel via our ship, this keeps accountability and officially puts you on our payroll. Also, with your ID number, you will be put into a team of hunters, please cooperate with each other as your lives may come to depend on it. That will be all."
The music resumes and everyone happily goes back to their drinks,gambling, and conversation. Most of the more noble looking individuals leave the cantina, presumably to the discussion chamber. Back at Orwen's table, he looks at his guests...
Orwen Gered: "Now, let's start with introductions."

As you begin talking to the others at the table. An assault of sensations overwhelms your mind all at once. Awne feels fear, hatred, aggression, and deception simultaneously. You also can feel the energy of people around you, but it's like a cloud of hateful emotions is encasing them in a sheen. It is very difficult to interpret these feelings. But it is similar to the times you meditated in your martial arts training, only much darker. You feel very cold once the sensations begin to subside, and you don't know whether to be angry or afraid. You are visibly distressed as Orwen attempts to shake you from your trance.
Orwen:" ..A ....r.......o....mis...? "
She then regains her senses to see the whole table looking at her.

Radon chuckles as he hears the droid compliment him on being almost as good as a droid when it came to pleasantries. He watches as the drink is delivered to the table, and smiles as Ordenn Rann motions him to the table. He walks over, taking the empty seat next to the woman, and was just about to begin conversation when the voice of a man booms over the speakers. The podracer turns to see who it is, though once the man identifies himself, he concludes that it's none other than that Representative they had been warned about an hour or so earlier.
Unlike most of the other patrons, Radon actually takes the time to listen to what the man has to say. Despite the man's obvious lack of practice in public speaking, he knows well enough to know that this particular speech was, in fact, a sales pitch. If the man did not mention the name of an ex-senator of the Republic, he would have been just as disinterested in it as a lot of the other patrons.
Then the mention of 10k in credits came up. When the diplomat asked his question, Radon was wondering the exact same thing. Besides, what 'specimens' could possibly be worth 10,000 credits alive? Addtionally, he was no hunter. Not by far. He'd run away from a firefight sooner than he'd finish one. Still, this whole hunt was worth looking into - the NR link between this place and Mos Esre was thin at best, but it was all he had to go on. His best move would be to join the diplomats in the inspection of the on-site facilities.
Radon listened to practically every word until the speech died down. He finally turned to the woman he had gotten himself seated besides and smiled at her, as if something was funny. "Can you believe that? An ex-senator heading this place? Who are these guys anyway? I guess they're not here for the gambling."

A sizable line of warriors is forming behind you, and you can smell the drinks on them..they seem very anxious. You have been put into Red team, and your ID number is 3.

Woroken notices Awne's momentary "issue." "Is the Farhgul alright," the wookie immediately inquires from Orwen, the only person that he knows speaks shriwook. After getting assurances that Awne was indeed sufferering no lasting malady, Woroken tells the gathered group, "Hey everyone, I am Woroken from Kashyyyk. It sounds as if, with the amount of credits being thrown around, there will be some major trapping competition on the planet. And looking at some of these others gathered here, it might be a good idea for a few of us to work together, for protection from some of these thugs, if nothing else..." as he nodded at a couple of the more unruly looking mercenary types. The wookie leaned back in his chair, really hoping some of the strangers at the table understand a bit of shriwook, and drunk deeply from his Hothan Ice.

"I..I'm fine, guess that had a little morre then what I'm used to having, should be morre carreful with drrinks I'm not famlierr with" She chuckles seemingly to look fine, her inner thoughts not showing on her face, only her tail that twitchs slightly in concern.

Bennosuke spots Awne in the cantina as she is visibly shaken, it is easy to see the disturbance in the cantina.
On the other side of the cantina, Ordenn and Radon begin a conversation.
Ordenn: "I know, that is exactly what I thought when I came to this station for work. He has made some appearances in the cantina and he is very nice, he bought a round for the entire cantina...seemed like a man who loved to have a good time. He seemed so innocent, like a child. As far as the people go, I believe it was Corlen's decision to hire them, he felt these types were the best to get this type of work done. I highly doubt he could have got any official fighting group to do this kind of work, with the pending investigations it would be just too risky to contribute to their efforts. I guess that left him with no choice, but I don't know how well these types can be trusted. I've worked with a lot of them, done things I'm not proud of, but I've kept my honor clean, for the most part. But to be honest with you, I think I'm going to take my ship and high tail it. I don't like the idea of an organized group of roughnecks going hunting...it's not my style. I prefer to work alone. But what brings a podracer to this station? How are you involved? What are your plans?"

Derak and Orwen both seem to understand your Shryiiwook easily. They assist to translate it to Awne. Everyone seems to lighten up a bit thanks to the drinks, however Derak seems a little distressed.
Derak Oodo: "Hello, I'm Derak Oodo...I've been working here for quite sometime. I run the store just outside of the cantina, and I'm a little upset because nothing is getting fixed around the station at the moment. My precious atrium has a problem with the power regulation and my trees are not receiving adequate water. If someone was good with computers they could take care of it. No matter, the New Republic had me work here as an assignment to monitor the supposed unethical research, I haven't discovered anything wrong and I doubt the ambassdors will either."
You notice that Orwen lights up at the mention of the Republic.
Orwen: "You are friendly to the Republic?"
Derak: "Why yes I am. I am working for Falsoor, but they are my home organization. My allegiance to them is unyielding."
Orwen: "Well everyone, if you'll excuse me and Derak, we must have a private conversation elsewhere. Take it easy on your drinks, and I'll see you guys later...hopefully."
Orwen and Derak promptly leave the table, leaving Woroken and Awne curious to what is going on.

Woroken gestures at Awne, sort of a shoulder shrug, indicating he has no idea what just happened. As the table is now half empty, he decideds to pay attention to his most pressing problem, his rumbling stomach. He makes another gesture, pointing at himself and then pantomiming an eating motion. He then points at the Farghul, and makes the same gesture. He stands, waiting for a response before going to place an order, whether it be for one or two.
There was something that was slightly eating at the wookie, however. Thinking back to the conversation with Derak, Woroken, thought, to himself, "How, on this large station, could there be no one 'good at computers' who could help Derak get his trees watered?" That seemed exceedingly strange, even though Woroken had no clue about such things himself.
Now he had questons for both Derak and Orwen...

You spot an astromech droid ferrying food and drinks around the cantina, he is silver with purple trim to him. He's whirring and beeping trying to get orders out to frantic patrons.

After a few minutes, the droid returns with your order.
Astromech: Beep beep ooooooooooppp *whirrrr* *raspberries*
You don't understand what he's saying...
He waits for you to grab your plates off his dome. It looks like dewback steak with a side of vegetables.
*Deduct 10 credits for whoever buys the meal.*

The wookie approaches the droid, attempting to get a food order in, and another of those sickly sweet Hothan Ices. "I guess they are growing on me," Woroken thinks with a smirk.
Woroken grabbed a plate, afterAwne did the same, and gestures for her to put away her cred chip, while settling up both orders with the droid. Woroken, never selfish when it came to spending creds for things he enjoyed, such as good food and drink, hurried back and grabbed their table before it was taken by another group.
*put me down for purchasing the meals and drinks*

While everyone in the station goes about their business, an announcement is made over the public sound system.
Protocol Droid: "Greetings everyone, um...oh my...We'd like to inform you that the Imperial Star Destroyer *Thunderpoint* has arrived in the system. They are sending an emissary to investigate someone who has committed a wrongdoing to the Remnant. Please remain calm, and let them go about their business. Our business will continue as normal, as the Imperial Officers tell us."
Everyone goes silent for a second, and then people began to file out of the cantina. They seem to be more concerned with getting their datapad information and going to their rooms.

She starts to go in to eat but stops listening to the announcement, and watchs as the other patrons leave "Seems, it might be a good idea to eat and get that inforrmation on ourr datapads" she mutters, and takes a bite of her veggitables.

*Good thing I already had my meal. Now for my drink.*
Radon manages to catch the attention of the barkeep, and decides that a light drink would serve his thirst for now. It wouldn't be very good for a famous person to be seen openly drunk. So, he hands over credits as he quenches his thirst, without removing eye-contact with the black marketeer.
"I wish I could just do the same as you - get out of here as fast as I could. Unfortunately, I was born here," he begins to reply. In between sips, he tells her and the others at the gambling table about his upcoming movie, and the decision to shoot it at and near Tatooine. "So you see, I don't really have a choice. Besides, I heard the NR already has an occupation force here, in some new place called Mos Esre, and honestly, that worries me more than some hunt. I admit, I'm worried there may be a connection in some way. I lived on Tatooine long enough to know that there are no such things as coincidences here. I wish I knew someone who could tell me more, though."

"No reason to let good food go to waste," thinks Woroken, as he calmly picks up his plate, gestures to Awne toward the line, and carries it to the information line, continuing to take large bites of the steak and vegetables as he calmly waits his turn for information for his card. "The Remnant investigating out here, huh," he thinks while waiting. It has been a most strange beginning to the day. On the bright side, though, the feline-ish farshul Awne seemed to be pleasant enough, though, and the wookie could understand her even if she could not do the same, and Orwen also seemed to be trustworthy...

Ordenn speaks with Radon as he buys himself a drink.
*Deduct two credits.*
Ordenn: "So I take it you'll be on that transport in the morning?"
Ordenn listens intently as the message is played over the sound system.
Ordenn: "Hmm, that's my cue...I'm going to head to my ship. We should talk again sometime, at first I thought you were a conceited pod jockey, but it seems there is more to you. Keep your nose clean around these Remnant types, they are ok but I still wouldn't want to cross them."
Ordenn gets up, gestures in a farewell... and leaves the cantina.
As Radon tries to find more about what's going on, the patrons are unusually evasive as they move swiftly to their rooms.

Awne picks up her plate too, looking confused for a moment as she follows the wookiee out suddenly feeling rather short compared to the Wookiee. It seems to click in her mind what they were doing and smiles "Good idea um.." her tail twitchs in confusion 'Have to ask that Orrwen laterr what his name is' she thinks "Um..Misterr Wookiee." She smiles sheepishly "Sorrrry but I don't know yourr name." She takes a bite of her steak, using a claw to cut pieces.

Woroken plugs his datapad into a nearby information terminal, trying to juggle eating and uploading information. After the datapad is updated, you see that your ID number is 7. Woroken has been placed on the Red team, and you notice the only other person currently in Red team is a person called Vor'en. You have directions to your room whenever you decide to go to bed. His full wookiee stomach is beginning to make him tired.
Awne, accompanying her furry friend, also uploads information. She notices she has ID number 9, and has been sorted onto red team with Woroken and Vor'en. She doesn't recognize these names.

Woroken nods, and shows Awne his datapad and points at the display. "Really, more species should practice learning Shriwook, as it is really quite simple," thought the wookie. Yet again, he resigned himself to buying that damned vox box whenever he got a chance.
While showing his display, Woroken takes another look around the place, to determine if anything out of the ordinary is happening while the mass of people quickly disperse. "I wonder how to determine who had done a wrong doing to the Ramnant. I'd like to buy them a drink," he thought while finisiing off his food.

He sees the ID's of the other members on his team, it shows a picture of them displayed by their names. He sees Vor'en, Awne Tora, and Woroken. He also notices that was the same person he saw that had an outbreak at the cantina. He also has gotten the information to his room. Awne could use the picture of Woroken to derive that it's him standing in front her, thus figuring out his name.

Bennosuke stands in the expansive lobby, and the crowd has seriously thinned...everyone seems to be going up the turbolift and finishing their downloads.

"I have a bit of shopping forr supplies to do, would you like to come?" Without really waiting for an answer she leaves the cantina and heads to Derek's store hoping the Ithorian is actually there this time.

"Guess so," he replies, realizing she's already told him all she could. "Yeah, you too. I'll see you again, if you ever decide to come back, of course." With the Remnant here, the air just seemed colder somehow. With old enemies in the same system, it just seemed like Ordenn was the sane one between the two of them. *"If only I didn't have business here,"* he sighed.
He got up, and started walking to the nearest terminal, uploading his information in order to join the group that was going planetside for the tour rather than the hunt. In fact, as soon as he finished, he walked out of the cantina, back to the atrium, and began to head towards the direction of the corporate headmaster's office. Maybe the man would be more forthcoming to someone more identifiable than the usual forgettable diplomats.

You notice Bennosuke standing fairly close to the atrium, and you begin to make the talking out as Derak and Orwen. Although you cannot see Derak and Orwen, you make the words out clearly.
Orwen: "So you tell me the Republic hasn't told you anything of my arrival on this station?"
Derak: "They have not mentioned you at all. Though, it might not have occured to them they had agents working so close together. Maybe we should tell them now?"
Orwen: "No, it'd be dangerous to transmit a message saying that we are together. I had requested help from Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy and they said they dispatched three Jedi Knights to come here."
Derak: "Jedi Knights? You should be safe when they get here."

Woroken had been trailing a good distance behind Awne, as he had been quite preoccupied checking the details of his team assignment, number, etc. As he was also finishing off the remnants of the meal he had bought earlier, he had fallen a good distance behind.
Seeing Orwen, Awne, and Derak together again, Woroken hustles up to join the gathering. "Hello again, everyone," the wookie said verbally ang gave a greeting wave to Awne, hoping to bypass the speech barrier. He notices the new person in the group, who had been assigned to the Red team as well.

As Radon takes a turbolift to go to the headmaster's offices, he reviews the information on his datapad. It seems he has been given the ID number 15 and he has been put on Red team. You see the names of Vor'en, Woroken, Awne Tora, and Bennosuke with their picture ID's. It appears that you will be rooming with them as well. The turbolift slows smoothly into a stop, and the doors slide open to reveal a long hallway with only one door. The halls are silver and very reflective, the lighting is dim however, and the floor is glossy black. You see two guards in a silver uniform with blaster pistols holstered. They are standing to the left and right, symmetrical to the door. You approach them and they ask for your identification.
Guard: "Hello, are you here to see Headmaster Doris? I'll need to know why you are visiting him and I'll need to see some identification....Wait a second...Are you...Radon Antila....the podracer? Great seeing you here! But what brings you out to our station? Sir, I'll still need to know why you want to talk to Doris...orders are orders."
Back at the atrium, Orwen Gered looks very distressed...and so does Derak.
Derak: "I'd be happy to assist you with my shop, we just need to talk as you are buying."
Orwen Gered: "Before you go, how much did you hear? I need specifics here. Let's try to get this out before the Imperials board the station."

Radon is pleased to find that his fame was at least helpful half of the time today. He smiles at the guard, and shrugs. "Yeah, it's me. Disguising myself didn't work at the cantina, so I decided to ditch the whole idea altogether," he admitted jokingly.
Though he knows he could probably make them believe a lie, he decides that, at least for now, honesty is the best policy. "As for why I'm here, to be completely honest, I'd just like some answers. I traveled Core-ward to make a couple of holovids, then I return to *my home planet* just to: a) see a shiny space station in orbit, b) hear that there's some New Republic force planetside and now c) realize there's an Imperial Remnant cap ship docked right outside the window!"
He sighs in frustration. "I've asked around, believe me, and all I can piece together is that Mr. Doris in there is the man I have to talk to if I wanna make sense of all this. Now, I know I'm no diplomat like the others who must've already passed by you, but since this planet was were I was born, I might as well be the 'Representative of Tatooine', or something, right?
"Look, guys, I just need to ask the man a favor. I know you're just doing your jobs, so I'd be happy to leave my blaster in your care when you let me through."
*Persuasion +7, hopefully the +2 circumstance bonus applies here too. Should this somehow fail, Radon will just thank the guards anyway and go straight to his listed room. If this succeeds but you need to speed things up, feel free to summarize what happens inside and send Radon to the room as well. Oh, and the favor is to get Radon moved to the diplomat's team as soon as the transport lands on the surface.*

"Wow! Three Jedi knights here? That's cool." Woroken excitedly blurts out, as he had missed the previous conversation. "Oops, sorry, I suppose that was a bit loud."
Maybe helping Jedi knights were the reason Woroken felt compelled to come to this station. He wasn't much of a hunter, and trapping animals seemed pretty blah (although the credits would be nice), but the idea of helping the Republic and Jedi knights made his wookie heart skip a beat. "I am getting way ahead of myself," he thought, but still, he acknowledged it would be cool to work with a Jedi...

Vor'en walks around near the hallway in his room searching for a caff shop. He plugs his datapad into a nearby terminal to check his credits account. It would seem that his contact had transferred 3,000 credits to his account for his job. Feeling a bit satisified, he continues his search for the caff shop but finds that the only shops are in the main lobby. They are the Aquarium, Derak's Wares, Vandio's Droids, Star Tear's Cantina, and Galaxy Pet Store. He wonder if he could find anything in these stores. Vor'en explores the lobby to find people that were on his team; he sees Woroken, Bennosuke, and Awne Tora all talking with a poorly dressed man and an ithorian. He wonders if he should say a word to his teammates, or continue on into a shop.
Orwen notices Vor'en approaching the group.
Orwen: "This isn't good. More people are gathering near our location. Woroken, you seem friendly to the Republic. I'd hate to impose this on you, but do you have quarters for the night that I could go to now? I have to get out of sight."
Orwen takes a moment to think.
Orwen: "Also, could you keep an eye out on these people that heard our information? They seem like your friends and I'd hate to impose this on everyone, but my mission is very important. People cannot be talking about it. Can you help me, my furry friend?"
With Orwen's question, Derak leads whoever wants to shop to his store. He stops at the durasteel door and inputs a code into the door panel, the door shoots open and he walks behind the counter.
Derak: "Before we start, I'd like to apologize for Orwen having someone watch over you like that. He's just in a lot of danger now, and he thought I could help him...sadly, I cannot. If I sell you these weapons, promise me you won't endanger Orwen or his mission. I know promises can be feigned, but please...give me your word...and make it convincing."

Awne follows the Ithorian into the shop and leans against the counter crossing her arms on the counter-top, one foot crossing the other and her tail swaying gently. She gives her most pleasent smile "I have no rreason to brring dangerr to him, afterr all..he was kind enough to ask if I was alrright afterr that incedent in the cantina..hell if I can, I'd happily prrotect him till his guarrds get herre" Her tail flicks at her genuine answer.

The wookie still apparently smarting from his lack of decorum, readily agrees to allow Orwen to share rooms for the evening. "Sorry about that, Orwen. Sometimes I forget that I...project...more than others."
Woroken shows Orwen the datapad and directions to the room. "Need me to escort you to the quarters, or would you prefer I stay with the red team, until they are through shopping? If I am walking with you, I would imagine you would get noticed a lot less..." Woroken knew from experience that a large, black furred, unkempt wookie attracted more than his fair share of attention. People with him sometimes became virtually invisible, it seemed.

Guard: "Sure, come on in my friend! Just surrender your blaster with us, by the way...you need to publish an instructional holovid on podracing, may help me get off this station!"
The guard inserts a code cylinder in the door panel by the durasteel door, the door slides open, and you walk into Doris's office. When Radon walks in, he can see a large gray desk with a polished white countertop. There are various supplies on the desk and it suggests this person has been working. Behind the desk, is a giant scarlet curtain, possibly to hide things of great value. Immediately flanking the curtain, are two statues of humans holding a planet. The office seems well designed and luxurious. A man is sitting behind a desk, wearing the silver uniform of Falsoor you have become familiar with. Yet, on his left breast you see a rank insignia of some sort, and he is wearing a fine red cape. You cannot see any weapons visible. The man appears to be in his forties or so, with black hair and clean shaven face. He has piercing brown eyes. As you approach the desk, he stands immediately, as if YOUR status was more important than his.
Corlen Doris: "Greetings my friend, what could I do for you?"
Though you cannot explain it, you feel a strange aura radiating from him. As if he was full of life and energy, and very conscious of his surroundings.

"And you as well," the wookie tells Orwen, as he disappears to the quarters.
Woroken, nothing if not a wookie of his word, turns to locate the remainder of the Red Team. Awne had mentioned wanting...a blaster, yeah, that was it, so the wookie turned an ventured to the ithorian's store.
Turning toward the store, he again noticed the copse of trees, and that thought came to his mind again--how could there be no one here who would help the ithorian with his computer problem? There had been computer experts even on the smallest cruisers that Woroken had been on while employed as a guard. There had to be hundreds of people here that were proficient with computers, and dozens that could have been termed as experts. When there was more time, that question had to be asked...

Awne looks between the Ithorian and the wookiee as they talk not sure what's going on but having the strange feeling of hope that the wookiee may be helping her. She smiles and takes a look around wondering if she could get the Wookiee something as thanks.
She turns back at the Ithorians words and sighs again then turns to the Wookiee "It's alrright, just something I give off I guess, comes with being a merrcenarry I guess I get that a lot" she chuckles, and turns to the Ithorian "You wouldn't happen to have a Vox Box would ya?"

The wookie shakes his large furry head to gesture that no, he did not have a vox box. After seeing that she planned on buying one for him, he patted her head with affection, hoping that through this a thank you would be communicated. That would definitely help with simple communication.
After Awne finished her shopping, the wookie passed her two of the four med pacs he had been given by the ithorian, and made a motion for her to keep those for future usage. There was no button on the vox box, that said, I have a feeling Red team might be needing these, unfortunately.

Radon surrenders his blaster just as he promised, and jokes with the guard that he might just do that podracing holovid before entering the office. Of course, he isn't surprised to see how clean and luxurious the office looks, as he'd seen too many of those back on Coruscant as he paid courtesy calls to senators in their respective offices. No, what surprised him was that it looked like Corlen Doris was expecting him!
The podracer bows courteously, introducing himself. "My name is Radon Antila, Mr. Doris. I'm not here to criticize you about your research, if that's what you're thinking. Actually, I'm here to ask you for a favor: I would like to be part of the group of diplomats that will go down to the surface to inspect your facilities. You see, sir, Tatooine is my home, and with all I've been hearing, I would like the chance to figure out for myself just what's been happening down there since I left. And to be honest, something tells me your company is where I should start."
All the while he spoke, Radon couldn't help but fidget in place. He felt uneasy in the man's presence, despite having heard what a good man he was from none other than a smuggler. It felt like his whole being was being scrutinized, and that was the kind of attention he so desperately didn't want. It was intimidating, to say the least.
"I'm... prepared to offer any help I can in exchange."

Looks at Radon Antila respectfully the whole time he speaks. He makes himself comfortable in his chair and pours him a drink of Juri Juice, he promptly offers it to Radon.
Corlen Doris: "Well first of all, I'd like to thank you for expressing interest in this organization. I don't lead in the research efforts, as you may you know. Luceen Elseior is the driving force behind all the research projects. I'm the driving force behind leadership, politics, and securing resources. But enough of that, you come seeking more answers about your homeworld. While I don't know much about what's going on in Tatooine, I do know that Luceen has taken a keen interest to research specimens down there. Perhaps you refer to the New Republic occupation in Mos Esre? They are not a sizable force, I believe they are an expeditonary group on a training operation. Something like a drill if they had to quickly mobilize to an Outer Rim Territory. I don't know for sure, maybe you can ask the New Republic? But still, quite alarming the Republic has made a motion to move into Tatooine. So, inspecting our facilities may be just something to pass the time while you get a grasp on Tatooine's situation. But, as you said, it's your home...you should be able to inspect us without any problems. You have my permission to move with the diplomatic team. However, unless you made reservations you'll have to bunk with a hunting team on the way to the surface. I'll grant you diplomat status for one favor in return, and don't do this as a compromise...do it out of goodwill which could start a beneficial relationship between two men. All of us on this station recognize you as a podracing star, so I'd like you to sponsor our organization in your races. I hear there are a few races coming up on Tatooine. As you may have heard, we've expanded from the science field into recreation as well. This helps the group become more family-oriented and it gets our name out quicker. It will help us secure resources to accomplish our goal. Which is to help us understand malice-based creatures, and have them peacefully coexist with others over time."
Corlen pauses for a second, and takes a sip from his juri juice.
Corlen: "Do you have any more questions?"

Bennosuke takes a moderate walk after getting off a turbolift to his room. He goes down a hallway to his direct left and opens the second door on his right. His room is fairly large, with 4 bunk beds inside of it. The room's entire material seems to be a black-duracrete theme, and it has been finely polished. This color helps to present the idea of being closer to the stars. There are plasteel cargo boxes neatly aligned underneath the bunk beds. The bed's have a grayish color to them, and there is a viewport at the end of the room letting you see the tan planet of Tatooine, it almost fills the entire viewport. There is a cabinet and a refresher sink just to the right of the viewport, and in the west part of a room is a bathroom. He crawls into bed, and shortly after...falls asleep.

Radon nodded. While he still felt uneasy, he had at least accomplished his objective. He was now, at least on paper, a 'diplomat' - a Falsoor diplomat, sure, but he hoped that meant he'd be able to move with more freedom in the company's facilities.
"Not to worry, sir. I already signed myself up for a room with some hunters, and I see no problem carrying your company's name in my races - though I'll have to speak with my manager to make the proper arrangements. But... what exactly did you mean by 'malice-based creatures?' I somehow feel insulted by that, being a native and all..."

"I'll update my information at one of your company terminals, along with my comlink frequency should you ever need to contact me in the future. Not to worry, I will have my manager contact you with details of my future podraces."

Radon smiles, shakes the hands of both guards after he retakes and holsters his blaster. Out of personal gratitude, he takes one of his blank datacards and signs it with his autoprint, and hands it over to the guards as a parting gift. As soon as the gift is given, Radon makes a semi-hasty motion back to the turbolift, heading for the level where his room was supposed to be. Inside the turbolift, the podracing star takes a deep breath. He was thankful that he managed to accomplish what he set out to do, but moreover, he was thankful to have left the headmaster's office room and that eerie feeling of life's fullness and energy. Despite how safe that felt, the fact that he felt anything at all truly scared him.
After all, on Tatooine, no one was truly safe.
As the turbolift travelled, he tried to distract himself by thinking about the nearest terminal where he'd immediately update his information as a diplomat. He knew it wouldn't help a lot, but it was the only thing he could do to shake fear off his mind while he was still awake.

Radon travels to the nearest information terminal, as he is walking there, he spots some imperial stormtroopers striding down a hallway. They pay no attention to Radon, but you at least know the imperial presence is here. Your datapad now has credentials that you are of diplomat status, and you will be treated as such.

However, he knows his body is too tired from all the day's events to even *think* of talking to a stormie. He simply makes his way to the room he had secured for the night, and opens the door, expecting all those other people listed as part of a hunting team to already be inside. He manages a weak smile as the door slides, and wonders how much of a surprise it would be for them to know a famous podracer is bunking with them. However, he manages only to see another human and a Wookie, both already asleep, so Radon decides to just head to the nearest bed, tuck his blaster until his pillow, and take a well-deserved rest.

Protocol Droid: "The transport for Tatooine is warming up and the crew is making all its pre-flight checks. Please make your way to docking bay five and properly check yourselves in, we will leave within two hours."

Red Team takes the turbolift to the twelfth level of the station, the hallway goes straight from the turbolift to a huge docking bay. The docking bay has large plasteel crates strewn about it, and the ceiling is at least 300 meters high. The whole room is gray and is packed with hunters trying to get into the ship. There is a line all the way at the end of the bay, people are trying to get through a checkpoint to get into a docking arm to board the ship. You can see the ship just outside of the bay, and the shields keep all of the oxygen inside the bay. The ship is so large that it would not fit into the docking bay itself.
*This is what the ship looks like: <!– m –>[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rescue_frigate](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rescue_frigate "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rescue_frigate")<!– m –>*
Next to the durasteel doors, two guards with silver Falsoor uniforms and blaster rifles are conducting searches to everyone who is walking into the docking arm. It seems they are checking identifications and all cargo being brought on board.
*If you have anything to hide, you can make deception checks.*

Radon's eyes opened swiftly as the need for sleep left his body. He immediately noticed two of the beds already unoccupied, meaning at least two of the other occupants had already left. The wookie was still there, as was the blaster jock he saw Ordenn Ran lecture to prior to their conversation. He shrugged as he holstered his blaster from under his pillow. *"Maybe it's fate,"* he thinks. He manages to make a cursory glance at the other human - the one that beat him to the room, and says "Good mornin'," before getting up to his feet. Radon was interested to learn all he could about these hunters, but knew that social niceties often fared better after taking care of one's hygiene.
So, instead of rushing to the docking bay immediately, he decides to take full advantage of the two-hour warning. Radon makes his bed, takes a refreshing shower and grooms himself, for if he was to be a diplomat, he thought he'd at least try to look the part, despite his common clothing. He sees the other human start to leave the room, and he does nothing to stop them. Radon simply takes care of himself first, checking that everything was in order, before taking one last look at the still sleeping folks in the room as he leaves the door. Radon makes a mental note to practice his Shryiwook, then decides it might be better to just buy a protocol droid sometime soon.
Checking the time at the nearby terminal, he realizes that despite his lead-time, the number of hunter trying to get on board the ship means that he still to scurry. Radon briskly walks along the hallways to the turbolift, passing by the human that had been in the room with him, standing in line with a member of the feline race - a Farghul, if he remembered correctly. He walked up to the guards, but he knew that these weren't likely to be the same ones guarding Corlen Doris' office. There was no other choice but to get in line. With all the interested hunters, however, there seemed to be no way to know just where the others of his supposed team were. He couldn't even find that one human among all these other humans.
So, he stood right beside the middle of the line, and yelled, **"I can't seem to find my team; can anyone tell me where Red Team is, please?"**

Radon sees that all the team has gathered together. They are all waiting patiently in line. Radon walks to Red Team and they all watch him approach the group. This would be an ideal time to get to know each other, as they may be working alongside each other in the fierce deserts of Tatooine. Maybe work on some coordination for their team?

After a brief moment of discussions with the other people in the line and checking his datapad, he manages to track down where Red Team was lined up. This was mainly for convenience's sake, however, as he was confident he wouldn't have to stay with them for very long.
"So why are you here then? I take it you're not from Tatoonie?" he hears the familiar human ask the farghul. As the woman replies then asks, "Who arre you anyway?" he approaches them and says, "Hi there. I'm Radon Antila. Red Team 15. You must be Bennosuke and you must be Awne Tora," he says. "Pleasure to meet you both," he says with a gleeful smile, extending his hand politely.

"Yeah, I'm from Mos Espa - well, not exactly there, but you get the point - and I'm a podracer. That's what most people know first about me."

Radon blinks. He doesn't really know what the feline meant by what she just said, but he figured she was referring to his budding movie career. "Well, if you mean a holovid hit, then yeah, I played lead in 'On Racer's Edge'. We're due to shoot the sequel here sometime in the near future."
"So what's a pod racer doing hunting animals?" he's asked by the human. He moves up the line in response to the motion of the line itself, before replying, "Don't really plan on doing that. I was just trying to find a way planetside, and this seemed like the easiest, if not only, way to do that."
He didn't feel the need to tell them that he was going to leave them and move to the diplomatic team as soon as the transport made surface.

When Awne crossed her throat with her finger, Radon froze. He was about to entertain the idea of someone having sent her to kill him when she apologized. He caught his breath immediately. He still wasn't in the right frame of mind to answer her question. Perhaps it was a blessing that she didn't actually know him.
When Ben pointed out what should've been obvious, he finally regained his composure. "I didn't really think of it that way, but I guess you're right..." he said thoughtfully. Then his eyes lit up and he took out his datapad, but before he could do any explaining, he heard her say she'd "hunted people", and he had to swallow. What did he just get himself into?!
"W-well, I guess between Awne and the wookie, I think this team shouldn't have a problem with the hunt even without me."

Weird.
That, in a nutshell, was the description of how Radon was feeling at that time. First he's threatened and it ends up being a joke, then the joker is suddenly being overly friendly, what with her arm around his - not that he minded, she *was* kind of cute, as far as mercenaries went. He finally managed to relax, letting his arm slump as she linked hers with it.
"Well," he began with a renewed cheer in his voice, "I shall be sure to enjoy the safety of your company as long as I can, Ms. Tora!"
He looked around, and was about to ask where the wookie and/or the blasterjock was, when the latter approached. He decided not to reveal that he had seen Vor'en once before.
"Radon Antila, mister soldier, sir. I would consider that like of work, really I would, but I'm from around here - can't get any backwater than Tatooine, in my opinion," he said light-heartedly.

Ben suddenly realizes that he doesn't like Voren. It's not because of his cocky cold additude but because of his willingness to work for the likes of that crime lord on the station.

Radon reassured her that he's fine. He was used to having women on his arm, of course, but none with claws until today. Still, she was a woman.
"I say you bring beauty and grace to this team," he said playfully. "The rest of us aren't particularly anything to look at," he jokes. He hoped his gleeful tone managed to disarm the situation, and he hoped no one else would say or do anything stupid. Otherwise, their hunt would be over before it even began.

A short jolt of surprise runs through Radon's body as Awne's tail wraps his tail around his other wrist. He manages to stay calm when he realizes it was just her being playful. That became even more evident when she poked his nose. Radon was finally enjoying himself, and feeling a bit regretful that he did have other plans.
"I look forward to it too, Awne," he said. He'd have poked her nose back, if she didn't have both of his arms grappled. "If only we'd met at less urgent times..."

*"One down."* he thinks, with the big grin still on his face. Now, how exactly was he going to get the other team members to lighten up just as easily? The other human from Tatooine seemed like he was a personal mission of some sort, and the cocky older soldier didn't seem to care about much beyond getting the mission done and over with. And they hadn't even really met the wookie yet. Oh, yes, the prospects for this team were pretty bleak. On the bright side, as he showed with Awne, things could only go up from here.
"Someday, then, Ms. Tora," he says, standing back upright as Awne released him from her hold. His face turned contemplative then, and he looked at each of them quizzically. "I do hope one of you can understand Shyriiwook, otherwise you'll find it hard to work with the wookie, no matter how good he is. I can barely understand the language, myself."

Ever the deep sleeper, Woroken was the last member out of bed that day. He quickly found the red team and made his introductions, having missed the fireworks between the group that just occurred. Unfortunately, he hit the wrong button as he was still learning the vox box, which said "Good bye" as he approached. "Sorry about that, name's Woroken. I'm from Kashyyyk, and I am still learning how to use this box. We ready to go? And does anyone else speak Shriwook?" Of course if they couldn't speak shriwook, they probably won't respond, thought the wookie.

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-06 10:47:35)

Radon turned to the sound of a vox-box saying a pre-programmed phrase - which oddly enough was 'goodbye'. It was from the wookie the data on Red Team he downloaded had identified as Woroken. When the wookie began to growl in his native language, all Radon could gather was the wookie's name, which he already knew, plus the words "Kashyyk" and "Shyriiwook". Otherwise, Radon couldn't really tell what the wookie was saying, apart from theorizing that it was a form of introduction, given what he must've mistakenly pressed on the vox-box.
He did his best to reply. "Sorry, Woroken, is it? I can barely understand your language myself, but that was an introduction, wasn't it? If so, I'm Radon Antila, pleased to meet you big guy." Radon smiled at the wookie. He was thankful that the wookie seemed eager to make friends, unlike Ben and Vor'en.

Woroken realized that is was going to be tough, as just about everyone in the party did in fact, not speak his language. Hopefully that would not endanger the team at some point. Woroken flashed a gesture similar to a thumb's up in response to Ben and Awne, who had queried about his sleeping.
He could tell that Radon only caught bits and pieces of what he said, so he greeted him with a gesture as well. Woroken had seen a few of Radon's holovids, including the well known action vids "On Racer's Edge" and "Galaxy Mission: The Death Force," but was more of a fan of the slower paced, independent vid "The Lathargic Landspeeder." There was a female wookie in that one that Woroken had paid particular attention to; if he had the chance, he would find out more about her from Radon.

Finally Ben decides to say what has been on his mind for the last bit of the conversation. "So I think I can provide us with a place to stay on Tatoonie, assuming they don't provide us with one anyways." Ben begins to talk faster and faster and looks down at the grounds as he speaks, "It's only about a half hour by speeder South of Mos Eisly. I don't know if it hasn't already been raided or destroyed, but its my old home and one way or another I have to go back there when we land."

Awne's got a good idea, thought Woroken. Maybe their throats could never utter the sounds needed to speak Shriwook, but they certainly could learn a few of the sounds. Woroken proceded to point to himself, and then say "Woroken." He then pointed to all the Red team and pronounced their names in turn. He then gave a geture indicating their surroundings, i.e. the station and gave its shriwook name. "That was well spent time," Woroken mused, as the line had began to move during thier language primer.
Woroken caught the conversation Awne and Ben were having re Tatoonie, and having no objection to same, stays silent. As Woroken had promised Orwen, he intended to "watch out" for the group. It would be much simpler if everyone decided to stay together. Only if someone objected to the idea, would Woroken attempt to assert himself in the conversation.

Awne listens closely to the sounds made from the wookiee for the station, their names and the other various things he was trying to teach them. Her tail flicks with concentration as she tries to mimic the sounds. She thanks her Farghul language for teaching her how to do certain things with noises. She continues to point and speak looking to the Wookie to make sure she gets it right.
She stops at the mention of weapons "Think I could get a blasterr?"

Hearing Awne's request for a blaster, made the wookie realize that both she and he probably needed a blaster with a stun setting, for if they were to have an opportunity to take an animal, if had to be unharmed. Claws, spears, and a bowcaster were not going to help in that matter.
"Stun grenades," the wookie blurted out to no on in particular. In all the action yesterday, he had forgotten to buy a stun grenade. That would be an especially helpful weapon for this sort of hunting. "Too late now, dammit..." was the thought running through Woroken's head.
Woroken began scanning the Red team to see if he could notice any on the team members.

In what had to be the first such movements ever made on the station, Woroken attempted to make a gesture of throwing a grenade, showing an explosion with a quick, upward raise of his arms and hands, then ceasing all motion in an attempt to appear frozen/stunned. The chances on anyone understanding this was slim and none, the wookie knew, but he wanted to make the effort. If he saw any visible stun grenades, he would have pointed at one as well, and given his now familiar thumb's up to same.

"Ah, good idea," Woroken realized. He was definitely more of a warrior then a teacher, and was unsure of himself. Hoever key words, such as stun, lethal, hurt, attack, etc. would definitely be helpful to describe to the team. The word stun would be a perfect chance to start. The speak and listen game started again, for the word "stun."

*Is it too late for Radon to take a Perception +6 check on the wookie's sign language already?*
Radon listens and watches intently at the exchange. The whole "speak and sign" trick seemed to be working. He knows it did for him when he was growing up *and* when he first set foot on Coruscant. He tries to remember all those basic words, attempting to add it to his meager, but respectable, wookie vocabulary. After all, words like "attack" and "run" would probably used quite a lot in the future. Although, he hoped, having a wookie around would certainly help his linguistic studies.
His attention turned immediately to the announcement when it was made. *"Mos Esre!"* he thought ecstatically. Whether it was fate or fortune, he was heading directly to where he wanted to go. Radon realized he wasn't going anywhere far from the team. He didn't know if that was a good thing, however.
Radon walked towards the checkpoint, unmindful of the pat down. After all, all he had as a weapon was his blaster, and seeing as how the licensing procedure had been done by the Coruscant Actor's Alliance for him - he couldn't believe the fees had even been waived - he really had nothing to worry about. The actor simply readied his ID and his gun license, and flashed the smile that won over billions of movie goers.

The wookie nods in agreement with Ben's suggestion to head to the cantina for a drink or two. As the group proceeds to the cantina, the wookie makes a mental note to check the cantina and see if Orwen made it to planet side as he mentioned earlier. Also Woroken wants to check out the other teams, mainly to see what team the other wookie at the announcement meeting was assigned. As far as the other groups, Woroken really wasn't worried..."If you take care of your end of the business, everything else will come into line," he thought.

After passing the checkpoint, he managed to catch up with the others, who had just located the quarters for Red Team. He immediately claimed the low bunk nearest to the door, a trick he had to make second nature in order to survive the 'urban wilds' of Mos Espa and Mos Eisley. Hearing Awne's comment, he chuckles.
"Sure, why not? If there's a half-decent galley on this ship, drinks are on me!" he declared, though he didn't really think there would be a lot of time for drinking. The transport was just going down to the surface afterall, and not crossing into another system. When Woroken began to lead the group to find the cantina, Radon followed with an optimistic spring in his step. He didn't know when he'd next have the opportunity to let loose and have fun as he was at that moment.

After all of you pass the checkpoint, you make your way to your room. It's very small, and your equipment piled around makes it very difficult to walk. You are told to stay in your quarters for the duration of the trip, as it won't last long. The beds are compartmentalized,you figure you might as well catch up on your sleep since you didn't get much last night. You could talk to the members of Red Team to stay awake.

**Awne's Perception 20+5=25; Radon's Perception 14+6=20. Radon also gains 50 experience for learning a bit more about their Wookiee friend.*
After Awne starts making herself comfortable in her very tight quarters, she takes a moment to ponder what everyone was carrying on them. It seemed they had kept most of their illegal equipment, perhaps the guards let them by? It's strange how they were checking for illegal contraband, yet everyone managed to retain it. Vor'en managed to keep his military-grade weapons even though his stormtrooper ID has long been expired. Radon, on the other hand, has managed to become somewhat adept at understanding Woroken's gestures, perhaps it has come from his days from podracing; in dealing with the multitude of different races.*

Well, since the cantina was off limits for while, Woroken decided to attempt another round of speak and define with the Red team. This time Woroken makes gestures strangely with both hands together side by side, with the back of them facing forward, with fingers pointing directly downward, extremely close together. He next makes a pointing motion with his hand in the form of a weapon, and then shows the fingers quickly spreading apart, and moves them in different directions (and pantomimes a running motion). He then voices a word.
"I wonder if any of them can figure out 'scramble/take cover,'" the wookie pondered. "That would definitely be helpful in a lot of situations we might find ourselves in."
After the lesson, so to speak, was over, Woroken plans on taking a quick catnap.

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-06 22:27:59)

Apparently, Radon was right. They really didn't have any time to do any social drinking or eating together on the ship as they were told to stay in their quarters. Despite not having the proper amount of sleep last night, his mind still wanted to keep thinking. As such, he sat on his bunk, and considered asking Woroken for further Shyriiwook lessons, and was surprised to see that the wookiee was thinking the same thing.
Radon carefully watched the wookiee's hand gestures and miming. He then listened intently to the growl that escaped from the fur-laden team member. He figured it was some sort of battle command, what with the weapon-like hand gesture. He'd already memorized the word for "run" way before, so that wasn't it. The podracer knew it was probably a single word, but as he wasn't a soldier anywhere but the movies, that word eluded him. So, he instead guessed a phrase, one more common than the singular word the wookiee was trying to convey.
"Does that mean, 'split up'?"

"Both were pretty close..." the wookie nodded after thinking for a second. He gave a casual wave of his hand to indicate that while the answers he got might not be exactly what he was asking for, it was certainly the same general principle he was attempting to relay.
In the future, he needed to figure a way to communicate to the others that they should give him words they think important for a crash course in shriwook. The next time he met someone fluent, he made a note to remember to make that request...

You hear an omniscient rumbling sound, and you can tell the ship is taking off. You guess the sublight engines has just cut in, and you are in motion. It would be nice to have a viewport in your room, but you figure this transport is merely for getting things around and not luxury. All of a sudden, the door slides open...but no one comes in. You just can see directly inside the hallway to the adjacent room, and the door to that room is closed.

As the ship powers up, Radon watches as Woroken gives them a casual nod and wave, which thankfully was a universally accepted way of saying, "Close but no Corellian cigar."
"All right, we'll take that to mean 'split up and hide' then," he says with a return nod. He was definitely going to watch out for that particular word. He begins to think of other words he feels might be important, when he's distracted by the soft sound of the door to their room opening.
"What the sarlacc...? Don't tell me we're the only ones with a broken door," he says rhetorically. He spies Awne moving up to the door and her hand reaching for her dagger. Not one to question a mercenary's instincts, Radon put his hand on his blaster as a precaution, but instead of following Awne's forward movement, he decided to move further back into the room along his bunk instead. He watches intently as she presses the button to close the door, only to see an orange Toydarian fly into the room and falling unconscious to the floor.

He began to look around the room, perhaps vainly, to see if there was a computer terminal he could access.

Woroken's eyes slowly open, and he sees the room is in utter shambles. The team's equipment is spilled all over the place. All of Red Team and the Toydarian are sprawled out across the floor. Woroken hears an alarm klaxon blaring. The room is now lit in emergency red lighting. The door is halfway open and damaged. The door seems to be knocked out of its tracks. The door is also bent over, it is definitely blocking your way out. Sparks are shooting out of the computer terminal. Just as Woroken is about to complete his assessment of the damage, he hears a computerized voice come over the public speaker.
Computerized voice: "We have a saboteur on the ship, all security placed on high alert. We have taken extreme damage to the engines and the hyperdrive. We have taken damage to the life support systems. Communications have been disabled. The transport is currently drifting towards Tatooine with no control. All non-security personnel please go to the escape pods on the eleventh floor, women and children first. Maintenance crew get to work on all flight-essential systems and attempt to repair the ship."
Woroken thinks of what to do next.

Woroken momentarily stunned by the blast, pauses for a moment. "What the hell?" he blurts out. If immediately looks at the rest of the red teamand the Toydarian, checking to see if they were injured, or just unconscious. If just unconscious, he attempts to wake the crew, beginning with Awne as she should be first off the ship in accordance with protocol. If any are injured, Woroken pulls the blanket off his bed, and attempts to make a crude stretcher for those individuals.
*Treat injuries at +6*
If everyone, can be awoken, the wookie points toward the group's equipment, and quickly grabs his items, preparing for their inevitable gallop to the escape pods.

*Woroken's Treat Injury 16+3=19; and you gain 50 experience. You don't lose a medpac.*
Woroken focuses hard and remembers his medical training. However, this task turns out to be quite easy for him. He notices that Red Team has been tossed around in the explosion of the ship and have simply been knocked unconscious. Radon, Awne, and the Toydarian have been hit the hardest so he evaluates it will be better to let them sleep a bit more because they will be too groggy and confused to do anything. He takes some smelling salts and waves them by Vor'en and Bennosuke. After a few seconds of choking, they awake...they appear to be very light headed and dizzy. They get to their feet. You also notice due to the lack of materials; it wouldn't help you much to try to look for a stretcher. You should probably just carry the other members on your backs. It would be ok because they are not seriously injured.

The wookie hands his spear and bowcaster to the still unsteady Ben, hoping that Ben would take the initiative to carry as much equipment of thet party as he could muster. He pointed to the still unconscious Radon, and then to Vor'en, expecting the apparently grizzled veteran could carry the podracer. Woroken grabs Awne and the Toydrian, throwing each across a shoulder. The Toydarian was much lighter than he appeared, thought the wookie. Once everyone is ready, Woroken will lead the way into the hallway toward the previously announced escape pods.

You can throw all your excess equipment in a blanket. It's just Radon's and Awne's spare items...maybe a few items from the rest of Red Team. But that's not the biggest of your problems, the door is horribly misfigured, and it is blocking your path. The controls to the door are destroyed, you must find a way to get rid of the door.

Just as it continues to move, the spear snaps and Woroken falls over. You made some progress on the door, and perhaps the Toydarian could squeeze through it. But he's in bad condition, and you could try something else. The message you heard earlier on the system repeats.

He felt a pang of sorrow as he galnced at the remnant of spear handle in his hand. "Father's gift, when I left Kashyyyk, broken." He made a mental note to grab the spearhead before they left...maybe it could be salvaged.
Woroken takes the vibroblade from Ben, and attempts to cut away further so that everyone can squeeze through. "Second time for the message. We had better get in gear..."' If the vibroblade didn't work, the wookie decided he was going to grab a blaster and fire a shot at the door. "That would get us through, no doubt, but there could be some backlash into this small room," he observes. ""But if we have no choice, it has to be done. Maybe I can stand closer and block most of the backlash," he decided.

Radon had barely gotten to the terminal when he heard the explosion and felt his body lauching itself towards the wall where the computer was mounted. The next thing he knew, he was sitting in the cockpit of his first podracer, wearing his first flight suit. His vintage red ThunderJawa's triple-turbos were humming beautifully, and he turned his head to the signal light ominously floating above the sandy track.
Red.
"You can do it, Radon," the soothing voice of a female Twi'lek told over his helmet's integrated comlink. "You just have to remember what it feels like to be chased across Tatooine, and remind yourself that one mistake means your life."
Red.
"Okay," he involuntarily replied. His body sent itself into a cold shiver, his nervousness getting the better of him. He was scared, very scared. Though he had pushed his father's landspeeder to it's limits many times before, he at least felt safe in that vehicle. A podracer, no matter how cool it looked, was still a very dangerous craft to be in. He panicked.
Yellow.
"I, I cant!" he screamed into his helmet. "I can't do it! I don't wanna die! Get me out of this thing!"
Yellow.
"Get a hold of yourself!" came his agent's reply. "Besides, it's too late to back out now, boy. Those other guys are are going to be after you, so have to pilot like you've never piloted before!"
Green!
Fear. Fear was his driving force. It was fear that made him switch the brakes off, and fear that made him push the throttle forward. Radon's own cries were drowned out by the roar of his might engines and the blasting of the air that his podracer left behind. He was ahead, ahead of everyone, and slowly but surely widening the gap. He maneuvered through the canyons and rocks that littered the track, with his face flushed white with fear all the while. He had no time to look out for his rivals; all he was thinking about, was to get away. He didn't notice himself make nearly impossible turns and stunts that would put most veterans to shame; all he was thinking about, was to stay alive.
He didn't even care when he'd passed the checkered flag and won; all he cared about, was that it was over.

If Woroken can't open it with the vibrobldae, Ben will try, since he as the training for it (woroken might not have advanced melee proficiency feat). "Anyone have any explosives at all? And where the kriff is Radon?" While Woroken tries to open the door, Ben searches through people's equipement for any explosives that could be used to open the door *Perception +7*. If he can't find anything he tries to wake the Toydarian, if he can be woken maybe he can go get help or free them or **something!**

The wookie sees Ben attempting to scan the room for something. Not waiting for any conversation, the wookie begins moving the bodies of the Red team and the Toydarian toward the back of the room, and out of as much blast radius as possible. He would give Ben a few moments, and while waiting, he began looking about to see if anyone had a blaster. If so, the wookie was going to grab it, and prepare to fire when Ben cleared the area, if Ben was unsucessful.

Awne had fallen into unconciousness during her meditation, she hadn't felt herself fall, but she had felt something wrong and then she was home. She was in her garden, in her favorite place. A little clearing farther into the garden and the woods that surrounded them, it was her place. Not even her father knew it was there, it was an openening in the trees, soft grass, with a small pool of water from the rains. She'd watched many animals come down from various places to drink from the pool, but this was her place where she meditated out of prying eyes.
She breathed deeply, the wind blowing her hair gently; she was home..but how? wasn't she on a transport just a few minutes ago? She looks around moving to the water and looking in. Same hair..same eyes..same clothes, was it a dream? had she really just come home instead of going to that station? No...there was a belt on her waist..Her utility belt! the one she bought at the station! Her hands touch the belt, it's real; 'So..that wasn't a drream..then..then this must be the drream!' She looks around expect the dream world to dissolve and find herself back on the transport, that's what a strange philosopher had told her during a flight, that when the mind realises it's in a dream the person wakes.
'Why am I not waking up?' Curious, she touches the water 'It's..It's cold..it's rreal waterr? how's that possible?' She wonders. The farghul sighs then stills as the wood suddenly grows silent. she reaches slowly for her dagger and in a quick movement draws it and spins into a defensive position looking around...nothing..there's no one there. Still tense she slowly moves from her position to just standing, her tail still arched in a ready position.
"Hello? Who's therre?"
Nothing..then..a sound..a voice.
"Hello?"
The wind blows, and with it words telling her to meditate.
The voice is calming, and she sheaths her blade and promptly sits, her legs folded on the ground, her hands on her knees, her tail by her side. She closes her eyes, and falls back into her mind.

"I've never used one of these carbine things, before, but I bet I can hit a door with it," Woroken muses. Assuming Ben could not find any explosives, the wookie grabs Vor'en's carbine, motions Ben and Vor'en to the back of the room, places himself between the door and the rest of the Red team, then pulls the trigger, aiming at the door.
*Assuming I need to roll to hit, the wookie should be at a +2. Also, I only took the carbine from Vor'en because ganthet is at work. If you prefer, I can rewrite it so that ganthet fires the carbine.*

Woroken fires a blaster at the door, the crack of the bolt is startling as it hits the door. There is a decent palm sized hole in the door. Woroken evaluates it will take more hits to the door to knock it down. Even after he shoots the door a few times, he will still have to knock the door over.

"Blam...Blam...Blam...Blam..." Those are the only sounds filling the small room assigned to the Red team. The wookie fires off 4 more quick rounds from the impressive carbine and takes a break to determine if the door is sufficiently weakened to force his way through. "Blam," went one more shot, just to be on the safe side, as with the 5 blasts, on top of the previous one, the wookie hoped he would be able to force his way through the mangled metal door. When he feels it is sufficiently weakened, he backs up, takes a run, and throws his shoulder into the door.

"Whoooo, that was one...strong...door," the slightly woozy wookie thought. Pausing for one slight second to catch his breath and refocus his efforts, the wookie clambers to his feet. He then grabs the spear head, tucking it into his belt.
"Here Vor'en, take this back..." Woroken says, momentarily forgetting that he was not fluent in Shriwook, when passing the weapon back to Vor'en. Looking around him at the decidely non-developed arm and shoulder muscles of Vor'en and Ben, the wookie re-evaluates his inital plan. He picks up Awne, and then Radon, leaving the much lighter Toydarian for Vor'en and Ben to carry. Vor'en agreed to take the lead, so it might be better for him to use that carbine, and carry the equipment, while Ben lugs (or drags) the drunken/unconscious creature.

The redness of his podracer was soon replaced by the redness of the lighting in the corridors. He opens his eyes, and immediately realizes he was being carried by the old soldier. He initially fails to see the aftermath of the explosion he was sure he heard, but his immediate attention went to the sharp pain on his head. Closing his eyes in minor agony, his hand began to nurse his head, feeling the bump where man smashed into ship.
"Ow..." he begins to groan. With his eyes still closed, Radon informs his rescuer that he's regained consciousness, and assures him that he can now stand on his own two feet. Almost immediately, his body gets dropped somewhat unceremoniously, but he manages to land on his feet. However, as soon as he opens eyes, his knees give way when he realizes just how horrifying explosion's aftermath had been. A mix of panic and sorrow makes his heart beat quicker and his eyes start moistening - he could recognize several of the hunters from when he tried to locate his team before boarding.
Nevertheless, he found the strength to beat on his own heart, forcing himself to breath longer and deeper, telling himself he'd already seen this much death on the surface of Tatooine. He swallowed as he pulled himself back up to his feet, and leaned against the wall as he caught his breath. There was no time to feel anything but pressure. Radon had to focus on surviving.
"This can't be good - there is coolant everywhere. I think someone doesn't like our employers very much," he heard Vor'en say. Despite the initial hostility, he was very glad to know the veteran was leading the way. He looked at the others, and felt concerned for Awne, who was seemingly still unconscious. Thankfully, Woroken was carrying her, and both the wookiee and Ben seemed to be on top of things. Then he heard the announcement: "The saboteurs are still on the ship, somebody please stop them. All escape pods that haven't been used have been jettisoned."
*"No!"* he screamed in his mind. He wasn't going to wake up just to hear he was doomed to die on this useless hulk of a transport. His mind immediately began to think up ways to help quicken their egress. It was then that he saw Vor'en look over to the turbolift, and to something nearby.
Radon tried to disregard the imagery of death all around as he made his way to the side of the soldier, looking past the man and seeing the computer terminal. Without a word, he practically pushed Vor'en aside as he linked his datapad into the terminal, hoping against hope he could get a map of some sort that would show them a safe and direct route to any remaining lifepods. If there weren't any, Radon knew the only other way was to get the ship repaired somehow, and with the saboteurs still on board, that prospect was far from appealing.
*Use Computer +7. Besides a map, Radon will try to get as much info about the current state of the ship and/or crew as he can.*

Radon begins bringing up information on the computer terminal. Every keystroke Radon makes is pure desperation, yet also it is precise calculation. The growing presence of the flooding sound outside is ever fear inducing, reminding you of the deep trouble you are in. With one solid tap of a key, Radon gets this information spreading out on the screen....

Although Radon is giving it everything he has of his computer skills, it seems all he can do is access cameras and download the map. The map shows everything about the ship you would need, you only need an idea where your going. He also estimates that this terminal can not access everything because it would make it too easy for people to get control measures over important areas of the ship. Radon realizes he could run a bypass to get past the security means, but it would take time.

Regardless of his own disbelief at his slicing ability, Radon believes there's simply no time for such a risky action. He looks up to Vor'en, then turns to the others on their way. "I've got the map, everyone in the turbolift as fast as you can! I'll try and make contact with the crew!" he screamed. Immediately, he returned his attention to the computer, he figured he had just enough time to do what he needed while the others headed for the lift.
First, he made a duplicate copy of the map, and handed over the datacard to Vor'en. Second, he began scanning through the cameras, downloading the latest few seconds or so of video from each one, trying to figure out where the crew and/or the saboteurs were. Next, he tried to see what he could do about restoring communication systems through the terminal. He knew their likelihood of surviving would be better if they could locate and contact any member of the command crew. As Radon tapped more keys, he hoped he could somehow reach the captain him- or herself.

Radon clears his last screen away, and attempts to download the camera information. Each camera he checks he sees differing amounts of damage. In the main hold he sees something truly horrific, something beyond words. The main hold has debris and rubble scattered everywhere with smoke making it barely viewable. The smoke billows just away from the camera enough to see a diplomat embracing a young girl, it seems they are trapped. It appears as if they crawled upon the top of the rubble and are trying to avoid being buried. Radon does a check of the area and the doors have been magnetically sealed, if he rerouted the power he could unseal the doors. But the communications are down and he doesn't know if they would even be aware of the doors. With a renewed urgency, he switches to the next camera. It brings up the screen of the engineering, and it is completely flooded. You can see all the engine systems immersed. He derives that this is the source of the flood, and it's coming from multiple tunnels. It occurs to Radon that he could seal tunnels off, but that would take a lot of time. Nearing frustration enough to just blast the terminal, he switches to the next screen. The cockpit seems to be in fine condition, except the pilot's are bleeding out of their backs by what appears to be blaster wounds. Radon continues his search by flipping yet another screen. The outer hull is shown...nothing but space. Then, in a flash three TIE fighters appear...but they are following right behind the ship. It seems very strange to Radon, they are just following.
Next, he checks on the main turbolift. The lift itself is being flooded, and the water has almost risen to their floor from the sub-levels. He discovers that is right outside the door. Lastly, he checks on the maintenance tunnels...and views a peculiar sight...a TIE pilot lying unconscious. This particular maintenance tunnel seems unharmed, and it may be the best way to travel to anywhere they are going. He believes it is a very obscure route for people to find him in, and would be the fastest way to get around since the turbolifts are down. Radon had so many choices bearing down on him, and it seemed like nothing...not even Podracing...would prepare him for the choices he was about to make.

It was a dizzying series of images that he saw, images of differing urgencies. The sight of the diplomat holding on to a girl tugged at his heart, but he knew that despite the danger they were in, they were still faring better than his own Red Team, for they were in immediate danger of drowning in coolant. He slammed his fist against the wall, trying to hold back his frustration, and decided that if there was any chance to save everyone, it lay in gaining access to the cockpit where the ship's main controls were (and didn't seem to be damaged). He wasn't naive, however; chances were, *if the Imperial pilot wasn't the saboteur*, the real saboteurs would be somewhere near the cockpit, too. Regardless, they would be able to send a distress call to the Imperials using the cockpit comm - something he wouldn't even have considered before now, especially since it was possible that the Remnant was behind the attack on the first place.
Radon immediately unplugged his datapad and gripped it tight. He started moving with the others into the turbolift and, as soon as everyone got in, punched in the location of the maintenance tunnel entrance in order to escape the continually flooding coolant. As soon as the lift began to distance itself from the flood, he said, "We need to get to the cockpit, and we're taking the maintenance tunnels to get there." His cold, frustrated tone meant that the issue wasn't up for discussion. "As far as I could see, the cockpit is our only hope," he explained, as she showed the still frames of each point of interest to the rest.
*Somebody try waking Awne up again, lol.*

When Radon goes to the turbolift door, he notices the lift itself has dropped below the sublevels. He interacts with the keypad to see that it has been disabled due to the lack of power, and the water has submersed it anyways rendering it useless. The red lighting in the chute is dim at best, and the flooding is loud making it hard to hear each other speak. He looks upward to the chute and he sees water running down their side of the chute. The chute looms up for thousands of meters. You cannot use the lift. You spot the only way up is a maintenance ladder directly ahead of you...about five meters over the water. The flood is rapidly uplifting making its way to your level. Radon uses the map on his datapad to discover that all you'd have to do is make it to the next maintenance tunnel...which would be right after the second floor.

Radon ground his teeth in further frustration. While he did immediately put the blame for the sabotage on the Imperials, he knew there was still no time to vent. Rather, it was time to get to that Imperial pilot in the tunnels, for maybe they could use him to call off the TIEs. Still, he couldn't convey that plan over the sound of the water, so all he could do for the moment was frantically point to the ladder on the other side of the chute.

Awne feels a sudden jolt of energy course through her veins, and it is unlike anything she has ever felt. It feels like some unknown energy is guiding her every movement, and somehow...she feels more alert than ever in her life. She notices that Woroken is carrying her, and everything is in complete chaos as she stares into a waterfall of darkness. She feels pain from those around her, as if voices are crying out, then becoming silenced...and somewhere...voices are faint.

Awne lets out a soft whimper at the feelings and sounds of pain echoing through her body and mind. Breathing deep she tries to gain some control over herself and figure out what happened. She touches the wookiee's shoulder muttering that she was awake now. He sets her down giving her a concerned look and saying something she didn't understand. Something told her he was asking if she was alright. She smiles and nods her head, regreting the movement as her head swims for a moment. She grips the wookiees arm and breathes, willing her vision to return to normal.
She looks up slowly and takes a look around the hallway, so much carnage and death in just one hallway and this feeling inside telling her there were far more hallways just like this. She wanted to cry, she wanted to just stop and cry for all the pain she felt 'Now's not the time Awne..laterr..when we get out then we can crry' she promises herself and turns to where the podracer seems to be motioning, A ladder 'we'rre climbing then' She looks at those around her and motions for them to drop whatever's not heavy "Trravel light!" She yells over the roaring water. Not waiting, she moves to the wall and takes a running jump to the ladder.

Radon smiled returned when he watched Awne first awaken, then jump across to the very ladder he was pointing to. He motioned to the others to follow, as he pocketed his belongings and prepared to mimic the Farghul as well as we possibly could. Moving to her starting point, the podracer took a deep breath, focused on his intense need to survive, and took off running, leaping off the edge and stretching his arms out for the ladder's rungs. As much as he craved water as any native of Tatooine, below him was just too much for his own personal tastes.

I alos figured the bowcaster is in the equipment pack that Vor'en is carrying as I don't think he could have it strapped across his back, and lug two of the team at the same time.* 
While not afraid of water per se, the wookie would not describe himself as a big fan of it, either. He moves as far backwards as possible, trying to get the largest amount of space to get a head start before launching himself forward.

Awne clings to the ladder, using her tail to help her stay balanced and secure but by having it wrapped around a rung of the ladder, her head still swims a little and she still feels strong emotions that don't seem to be coming from her.

Woroken backs up and takes a running leap, and clears the distance. Bennosuke, on the other hand, follows right behind Woroken but fails to get to the ladder and plummets into the water. Radon now climbs the ladder very far below the Farghul. The water has risen about three meters, and you guess it's not much longer until it floods the first deck.
Bennosuke sees the bubbles all around him, the water is very blue and cold. The toydarian is thrashing violently on his back. He realizes that the toydarian will definitely slow him down while he swims.

Woroken agreed with the Farghul-- the best thing he can do for everyone right now is to climb the ladder, and move out of everyone else's way. The wookie was much larger mass wise, than anyone else on the Red team, and his being on the ladder took up much more room than the others. "Awne can handle helping the others up the ladder, if I can get out of the way," he said to himself. Once he got to higher ground, he could then relevaluate the situation and see if he could help somehow.

While climbing the ladder, the wookie broke the "golden rule." He looked down; in the rising current of flooding he saw Ben struggling with the weight of the still unconscious Toydarian. "I can't believe I forgot to help him after Radon and Awne woke up..." As the wookie watches to see if Ben can swim with the weight on his shoulders, he reaches into his field kit and pulls out the breathmask. If he had to get wet, he at least wouldn't drown.

After gaining his bearings, Woroken grabs for the rope that has been extended from Vor'en. Assuming that is sucessful, he attempts to hand the rope to Ben, and take the Toydarian from Ben, to ease the poor swimmer's load. All of this needs to be done while swimming, of course.

Awne and Woroken easily stay afloat in the water, and they can see the water almost aligning to the first floor where Vor'en is standing. Bennosuke fires a syntherope and barely manages to catch the hook on a rung. He's holding his breath desperately as he attempts to pull himself and the toydarian out.

Radon grabs the ladder, and start heading up. He grumbles as he feels the cold of the water from his now-wet clothing, but gets even more so when a splash occurs behind him. Looking up, he sees the wookiee, the farghul, and the veteran looking down, meaning it had to be his planet-mate that just fell in the water. Before he could even decide whether to continue up or go back into the water, he watches the wookiee dive into Awne, so he clings to the ladder until both of them clears, before getting a steady grip and foothold at the ladder. He didn't know if either was a good swimmer, but he certainly knew he wasn't any more athletic than either one. The best thing for him to do now, was to keep climbing up to the maintenance tunnel and clear the ladder for the others.

As he reaches the end of the ladder, Radon could barely make out Awne's yell over the rising tide. He does, however, manage to understand the last part. He inches his way up as fast as he safely could, but slowed as he reached the edge of the tunnel. Radon knew the only thing of importance in the tunnel was that unconscious Imperial, but he wasn't going to take any chances, either. Gripping onto the rung with his left hand, Radon drew his blaster and pointed it at the tunnel, before pulling himself up by a single rung to check if the tunnel was clear. He would be more than happy to quickly get off the ladder if it was.

Awne breaths a sigh of relief seeing that one of the team had made it to the top, and turns her attention down to the two in the water "Worro! help him get his head up!" The wookiee lets out a bellow saying that he understood and follows the Farghuls lead, linking an arm into the ladder to help him stay above water and pulls the rope and the two attached to it to the surface. Rather then have this all happen again, and to help with the dead weight, the Wookiee thinks it best when the human breaks the surface to tie the rope around humans waist, the drunks waist, and then the wookiees, sharing the burden of the dead weight between three people instead of one.

The entire Red Team unites underwater and begins tugging on Bennosuke, using the rope to pull them to the rung. Woroken extends his long arm and grasps the rung...using his other arm he guides Bennosuke and the Toydarian to safety. Bennosuke begins climbing gasping for air. *State whether or not you pass the Toydarian off.* Everyone else treads water waiting for Bennosuke to make his move. Meanwhile, Vor'en just looks at the water, and drops in a short distance. He swims to the rest of the team using the rope.
Radon climbs the ladder as the water falls to the bottom of the chute, he looks up and he sees the opening of the tunnel past the second floor door. He musters all his strength to his muscles to aid his climb. Just when he reaches the top of the maintenance tunnel opening, he holds his blaster up at the ready...scanning the length of the tunnel. The tunnel is quite wide, with metal grating on the floor. The ceiling is about 10 feet tall, and there are white lights dimly illuminating the area. You see a multitude of brown plasteel bins aligned on the walls. The area seems empty. *Those who used liquid cable dispensers, they are now disposed.*

ONce he sees the Toydarian is in good hands he passes him off, and grabs onto the rung when he finally gets there. "Thank you so much. Thank you thank you. I'm so sorry." he sobs, coughing up water, his normally beautiful black hair now clinging to him like a mishapen helmet. "I just couldn't let another one die. I just couldn't. I'm so sorry." He coughs hard several times and stops trying to talk.

She urges Ben up the ladder, taking the drunk and handing him off to the wookiee, The human's had enough of the weight time to give it to someone else.

Radon breaths a sigh of relief as he seems the tunnel was clear, though not without making him ask questions like, *"10-foot tall corridors are tunnels? For who?"* Of course, he doesn't particularly take the time to ponder such things further. Instead, he completes the journey to the tunnel, and decides to duck behind some of the bins, watching the corridor with his blaster as he waits for the others to come up. He really wishes Vor'en or Woroken would get up here soon. This whole 'pointman' deal wasn't particularly to his liking - the life expectancy at the front was much too short. As he waits, he whips his clothing lightly, trying to dry himself as much as he humanly could. For once in his life, he was looking forward to sand.

Radon moves up to the plasteel bin, as he walks, he can hear each metallic clank footfall hitting the ground. He kneels behind the bin and whips out his datapad for a second. The blue light illuminates his face in the dim corridor, he punches in the directions for the cockpit. A red line begins tracing through the ways of the ship map; it goes forward about 100 meters, up a ladder about 8 floors, and it branches left about 50 meters to the cockpit. He sees his destination and how to get there. He takes a moment to gather his breath and looks down the hallway, absolutely nothing in sight... this corridor is relatively undamaged. A few more seconds elapse and he hears a soggy thump behind him at the entrance. Bennosuke has fallen over and the toydarian next to him... he sees Bennosuke's chest rising and falling quickly. The Toydarian seems not to be breathing at all however. Vor'en quickly ascends over the top of the floor and immediately assumes an expert security posture with his E-11, he spots Radon immediately and smiles...lowering his weapon. A few seconds later, the Farghul nimbly gets to the floor, sopping wet and dripping all over the place. Finally, Woroken arrives and his fur is drooping all over his body, drenched in water. They gather their bearings and plan their next move.

Workoen was not particularly pleased with his station in life at the current moment. Wet with foul smelling liquid, slightly banged up from falling into Awne, and still not seeing a way off this bucket of bolts.

*"Oh, great, another ladder,"* Radon mused. He motioned for Vor'en to come to the front, and tells him the directions. The racer wasn't about to the take the lead with his meager blaster skills. "Everyone okay? Good, because we've got another 8 floors worth of ladder to climb, just ahead."
"Oh, and keep an eye out for an unconscious Imperial in a pilot's suit - I saw one on the cameras, and I think he might be the saboteur," he says, now making it clear who he thought was responsible for the attack. It wasn't difficult to put 2 and 2 together when you've got an Imperial inside and 3 TIEs attacking outside. Still, they had to keep moving. "So, whenever you're ready, mister soldier, sir."

Woroken kneels next to the Toydarian, ignoring his growing fatigue and chills. With solemn concentration, he begins an evaluation on the unconscious creature. He feels that his pulse is very feint, and he is not breathing. He needs to perform resuscitation now. The others look desperate as they realize this floor will be flooded very soon.
Radon remembers that the pilot was on the sixth floor maintenance tunnel.

He removes his blaster carbine from his belt. And whe we do go, I'll be you're second." He doesn't say this while looking at anyone, he's too ashamed of the trouble he's gotten everyone else into. "And if anyone needs a grenade, let me know."

Radon notices the look of concern on the wookiee's face, despite all the fur. He realized the Toydarian was in critical condition. He so badly wanted to just say leave the drunken bum behind because he deserved it, but hearing how Ben didn't want to leave the flier behind made him stop himself from being so tactless. That didn't mean he wasn't going to be insensitive about it, either.
"All, right, big guy, wake him up so he can fly on his own. Otherwise, he's as good as dead," he says, as he jogs up with the group to the ladder, making a ruckus as the metal grates clank under their feet. "I just remembered - the Imperial's on the sixth floor tunnel. We need to take that detour - he might have something on him that'll get those TIEs off the ship. Go!"

*Woroken's treat injury check 6+6+5=17*
Woroken realizes he won't need a medpac, as all he needs to do is resuscitation. He begins pushing his hands on the toydarian's small chest, hands almost too big to do this delicate task. After twelve pushes, he breathes into the mouth of the toydarian, pulling his trunk back. Woroken continues this cycle a couple more times, and realizes that the Toydarian has passed away. He can't do anything, and remorsefully runs to the ladder. He looks up to see Red team quickly ascending the ladder. The ladder passes through each maintenance corridor. You figure out that this is the fastest way to get access to each section of the ship, obviously for emergencies like this, and that is why the corridor doors are unsealed. You climb steadily, passing through a narrow opening as you pass each floor. Each maintenance corridor you climb through, seems equally deserted and low-lit as the last. Red Team stops on the sixth floor, and disperses from the ladder. The team estimates they have covered good distance from the flooded areas, and they may have time to advert this disaster after all. About 25 meters to your left, Radon spots the fallen TIE pilot from the camera feeds. He is motionless.

He felt really empty. Ben had tried so hard to save that poor Toydarian, and regardless of who he had been Ben had let him down. Just like his father and his brother, and probably somehow his mother. He had let everyone down, even the Red Team, if he had been quicker or a better swimmer he wouldn't have caused such a scene, and maybe they would already be off this hellish ship by now. His fingers clutched the handle of his blaster carbine. He wasn't going to let anyone down anylonger. No more mistakes

He then focused on getting to the sixth floor, and once there, saw the fallen Imperial. "There he is," points Radon. "Someone check if he's still breathing and, if necessary, hold him down while the others search him."
Radon didn't like having to steal or scavenge, but survival was his only concern at the moment. Everything else was pointless.

Woroken was no stranger to death. He had had friends, neighbors, etc. pass away on Kashyyyk. He had seen several people killed by blaster fire on some of his trading ship guard duties. Something about the death of this unknown Toydarian really bothered him however. Why did the creature pick their room to enter last night? Was he meant to be there, and deliver some information that would have been critical to someone? Or was he just a random drunk? Something about this just felt...wrong.
Steeling himself again, Woroken followed Ben and climbed to meet the remainder of the party. As he was no longer carrying any party member, he grabs his bowcaster and quarrels from the equipment "bag."

The pilot also has a bandolier across his chest. Just when you are about a meter away, the pilot sits up, and looks in your direction. The pilot's black helmet with the evil features stares directly at you, he instinctively reaches for his pistols....

Maybe he's even hoping the pilot will make a wrong move, so he has an excuse to kill him. He keeps his carbine trailed on the pilot's head, any bad moves and Ben fires. -^-

Radon's eyes darted quickly as soon as he saw the Imperial's hand reach for his blaster. While he knew his colleagues were taking a passive stance, Radon thought only of his fearful frustration. He was afraid of getting killed and was frustrated that everything was going wrong. He didn't want this, any of this; all he wanted was to get home. Instinctively, he pushed himself forward and stepped on the downed Imperial's hand, *hard*. He kept his foot on the hand as he leveled his blaster at the pilot's visor, he gritted his teeth and put his finger on the trigger, trying his very best to restrain himself from just getting it over with.
"Listen here, you insignificant little mynock," he began, with evident anger in his voice. "Right now, I think this is all your fault. I think you're the reason why we're running around this ship trying to stay alive. Now, *they* might not be keen on killing a helpless man, but *I* sure as sand don't care. *My* immediate concern is to find a way to save this ship from getting space junked by three of your TIE friends outside, and if I need to shoot you to get your comlink or whatever, I will. One more dead body isn't going to make me feel any more ill than I already am."
He arched his eyebrows and stared deep into the man's helmet. "So go ahead, Imperial, *make my day.*"

Awne looks at Radon surprised at his actions. Her eyes narrow at his words and low growl escapes her, in a few quick strides she's at the podracers side her hand over his on the weapon, and pushes it away from the imperial, forcing it out of his hands with her other and tosses it to the Wookiee, she glowers at him, her growl still present as her tail twitches dangerously. She pushes him off of the downed pilots hand and turns to look at the pilot "I'm not going to let him kill you without us getting answerrs, I expect you to move yourr hands away frrom yourr weapons and behave yourrself."
She turns back to the podracer and growls "And I expect you to behave yourrself as well, none of us arre happy about this situation, we all want to get to safety, but killing the one perrson that might be able to help us figurre out HOW to get to safety is NOT going to help us."

"How to tell Radon to not harm this person..." Woroken thought quickly. The fiery tempered podracer had skipped a couple steps in negotiations. Since Woroken had the vox box in hand, he pressed the "I mean no harm" button 3 quick times in succession. The wookie hoped that both the Tie fighter and Radon would take notice of this distraction, allowing cooler heads to prevail.
Thankfully, contemporaneously with Woroken's vox boxing, the cat-like reflexes of the Farghul sprung into action, and disarmed the encounter. Woroken took the pistol and made a double palm down motion to Radon, gesturing for him to calm himself.
It was quite a task that Orwen put to Woroken. "Watch out for your team members." As the farghul began detante with the pilot, after scolding Radon, the wookie's thoughts began to drift slightly. Did Orwen have any idea what the team was made of? The wookie's early impressions were not completely favorable. A veteran mercenary who prefers to keep to himself. A fiery tempered holovid star/podracer. A smallish human who Woroken didn't remember seeing smile a single time--there had to something sad there that needed healing. Woroken made a mental note to spend more time with Ben. Maybe her just needed a friend. The glue holding this crew together appeared to be the female farghul Awne, who could shift from concerned mother hen to cat quick warrior almost immediately. ANd she was mistrusted enough by Derak that he would not sell her a blaster. "This job was not going to be easy, Orwen."

Radon almost blows up at Awne, but before he could vent out all his frustrations to her face, Woroken's incessant pressing of 'I mean no harm' worked its magic, irritating as it was. He looks sternly at the farghul, before relenting to the wookiee and releasing his foot from the man's nearly crushed hand. He gestures a motion of slight surrender, taking his blaster from Woroken and making a big show of putting it back into his holster. Still pretty exasperated, the movie star walks briskly to the edge of the wall, dropping down to the floor and sitting down against it. If they were going to waste more time trying to interrogate someone they knew they wouldn't be able to take with them anyway (the Toydarian had been proof of that, he believed), then he was going to take the time to dry himself off.
As he sat resting against the cold metal wall, he began to squeeze the water out of the edges of his clothing and said, "Fine. Do what you want with him. Just don't expect me to be happy until we're safely out of this ship."

"Listen boy, I dont know who you are and i dont know how i got here but i do know this... It would be in your best interest to listen to the Farghul and still your tongue."

*"So it speaks,"* Radon thinks to himself. While he tempers his anger by making a conscious effort not to draw his blaster, Radon simply doesn't believe the Imperial has amnesia. It was too convenient an excuse, especially at a time like this. Regardless, he had all but given his word that he would back off, so all he did was wring his clothes completely dry while keeping in mind that, even though they had a head start from the flooding, they weren't completely in the clear.
But the Imperial's excuse did cause him some concern. If, in case, the man really had lost his memory, then trying to contact the TIEs through him might not be as viable an option as he originally thought. This possibility made it impossible for Radon to sit still any longer, and so wordlessly, with rhythmic stepping on the grated tunnel floor, he turned back along the tunnel and started walking back towards the ladder.
Passing by Woroken, Radon took out his comlink and exchanged comm frequencies with the wookiee. "When you're done with this guy, I'll be waiting for all of you at the cockpit. I think I can seal off the coolant leak from there; hopefully that'll buy us more time to deal with the TIEs and save that diplomat and girl I saw trapped in the cargo hold."

Ben takes a second to cool his head before talking. He keeps his gun up just incase, but decides for now not to worry too much about danger. "Listen up," Ben says very slowly trying to force the anger in his throat down down into his chest and out of his voice, "This ship is going down, it's been sabataouged and is flooding, to the point that we can't stay here much longer. There is a fair amount of evidence pointing at the fact that you are the one who sabatouged it. Since you don't seem to remember this, it would be stupid to hold it against you, I guess, even though I don't want to. Now we all have to get off this ship or pilot it to safety. Since I'm sure you want to live too, we might as well work together on this, especially since you might be the key to figureing out how to save the ship."
"So do you want to help or do you want us to leave you here. My wookie friend is a pretty good medic, once we confiscate your weapons I"m sure he would be willing to help you out in any way neccisary. So what do you say, will you help us?"
*And could I get a perception check +7 to see if he's using any deception or anything, because the amnesia would be pretty convinient.*

Awne sighs in disapointment at the podracer as he leaves and at the the soldier 'Men..doesn't matterr the rrace, men arre always so hot-headed' she thinks with a frown. She turns to the impereal, her tail flicking gently but still tense, the thought still present that they aren't out of trouble yet "Ben's rright, we'rre all going to crrash if we don't do something. You'rre a pilot, and I'm hoping you still rrememberr how to fly. We have to stabalize the ship, get the TIE fighterrs off of us, and get that coolent underr contrrol. We arren't out of this yet." Throughout her speech she turned from the pilot to the others of the group, "I don't rreally carre if you don't like eachotherr, what I carre is that we all have skills that can help save ourr lives. If we worrk togetherr we can get out of this, now lets get to that cockpit!" She finishes and takes one last look at her pack, then turns to look at the pilot. She grins and begins to walk off following the path the podracer took to the cockpit.

The pilot glances around and notices that by the looks of things the ship isn't in much better shape than his head. Finally able to absorb the situation now that these filth are not trying to find a reason to end his life he decides that based on the situation he would probably be better off having their help for the moment. The pilot turns the group, his face hidden behind the black of his helmet. "Alright I'll help for the time being, but if you scum think I'm giving up my blasters after what you have done to me then you are dumber than I give you credit." "As for you (pointing to Radon) I don't know who you are, but if you ever lay your hand on me again I will blow a hole through your skull big enough for a Shuttle to land."

So long as you give them no rreason to hurrt you then you have no rreason to fearr. You don't pull a blasterr then neitherr do they that's how this worrks. Now come on, we'rre wasting time."

Radon, having already turned his back and lead the way to the ladder, didn't know that the Imperial was pointing to him. Still, it wasn't too much of a stretch to assume the threat was aimed at him. He raised his voice a bit so it would carry back to the Imperial, "Let me lay it out for you, Imperial: if you can't fly this ship *or* stop your buddies from blasting us to pieces, then we're all dead anyway, and you won't have to worry about anyone laying a hand on you or anything anymore."
He made it a few steps closer to the ladder, then finished in Huttese, ""
Radon didn't know if any one of the others could understand the language of the Hutts - except, perhaps, Bennouske - but it was the one way he figured he could verbally vent without anyone getting any further upset... hopefully. ""
He sighed as he finally managed to speak his mind, albeit to an audience that probably didn't understand a third of what he said. Calming himself thus, Radon then focused on the tasks he had laid out in his mind, reciting them softly, over and over, still in Huttese. ""
With seemingly renewed vigor, Radon climbed every rung of the ladder with every repetition. At the very least, hearing himself talk like he did during pre-race checks meant he was still alive and well.

Still unsure of the pilot's motives, Woroken mades a mental decision to stay close to him. Amnesia did seem a convenient truth, but one way or another, the pilot might help them get off this ship. If he became a problem, the wookie determined that he wouldn't be a problem for long. Woroken decided to immediately follow the pilot in the "marching order," so he could keep a close eye on him.
Woroken, with his vox box in hand, hit the "Greetings" button while facing the pilot.

The Pilot, still overwhelmed and furious with the events of the past few moment glanced at the wookie and nodded his head in a gesture of acknowledgment. The pilot strode away a short distance from the party to calm himself and gather his wits, and try to remember what had happened, or why he carried this unshakeable disgust for these men. He hated them. He hated everyone. Except... except for... Reka, he loved Reka. But who was she? A vision washed over The Pilot and he slammed his fist into the wall, grabbed his helmet and fell to his knees yelling in a rage loud enough for even the ones who had already moved down the hall to hear.

He turnst to Radon with a small smile and in huttese says "Lets hope the Imperial slimo still remembers how to pilot, otherwise he's already more trouble than he's worth. And let's just hope he's as good a pilot as you or I, otherwise we might as well space him now." And starts jogging down the corridore, Blaster Carbine still in hand.

Checking first to be sure teh pilot was not reaching for a weapon, Woroken reached a long, furry arm down to assist the man, should he need it when getting to his feet. Apparently, he did. The wookie helped the pilot up, and made a gesture to him to hurry down the corridor, and follow the others. With the strange reactions from this fellow, the wookie knew he would have to keep a close eye on him. He followed closely behind the pilot.

Radon is a bit taken aback to hearing the Imperial's scream, and then Ben's laughter. He didn't particularly care for the Imperial's anguish (*"An Imperial? In anguish? Oh, sure,"* he thought sarcarstically). On the other hand, the other human from Tatooine did understand what he meant, and that little touch of home made Radon's anger subside substantially, making him smile once more. It was to be expected, really - from the way Ben raised his rifle at the pilot on instinct meant they both had had the same experiences on the surface. That was an instinct he knew to be common only to those who grew up in the fringe, where the need to survive trumped everything else. Not normally a trusting fellow, Radon decided that among all of Red Team, he could at least give Bennouske the greatest benefit of the doubt.
Keeping the Huttese between them, he replied to Ben, making a small nod and admitting, ""

As the wookie reached down to assist the Pilot, the Pilot snapped back to reality, his anger boiling inside without realizing he lashed out at the wookie. "Do not touch me you filth!" "It was because of people like you that she had to die." As he stands back to his feet the Pilot begins to follow the others along the corridor. The anger inside him pushing him along faster and faster. Believing full heartedly that the two men running ahead of him were no different than those men so long ago. If they were as evil as he was beginning to believe then he would be there when they made their choice. (Just like those thugs, he thought). As he ran along only one word coursed through his mind..... ""Reka""

"Good thing for you we have to get off this ship," Woroken said out loud, not expecting the pilot to understand him. The wookie, while much more easygoing than most of his species, was not a big fan of being slurred, even by someone who might be effected by some mental issues currently. "He's out of his mind," the wookie thought, but even still Woroken found a part of himself hoping that the pilot would pull one of his pistols, so that the wookie could help "convince" him to drop the weapons.

It was difficult not to hear the wookiee's growling. Radon didn't really understand the statement entirely, but it wasn't hard to get the sense that Woroken was also getting irritated with the Imperial. Unluckily for the pilot, he was both irritating *and* an Imperial; it wasn't a good combination for making friends with a wookiee, Radon mused lightly.
Switching back to Basic as soon as he had heard Ben's reply, he said, "That's *if* there are any working turrets on this transport at all. And in case that guy's really lost his memory, then we might still need to watch out for those saboteurs."

She had to smile though as Ben introduced himself, thinking maybe they could get onto a better start now. She turns to the Imperial, her tail swishing behind her "I'm Awne; Awne Torra. " She says with a friendly smile; imperial or not, amensic or not, they all needed eachother to get out of this alive...'Taurus-headed men..' she thinks with sigh, using the term she heard once from a female bounty hunter she had worked with.

Radon didn't follow suit with all the introductions. If the Imperial didn't know who he was, then Radon wanted to keep it that way. For the moment, the movie star had to add the shields to his list of things to check and hopefully keep running. Only then did he realize how many things he had to leave up to fate. He didn't like that one bit - there were too many unknowns, too many uncertainties, and every one of them that didn't come out favorably would be disastrous. In order to stop himself from thinking anymore negatively, he returned to his soft checklisting as they continued to the cockpit.
"Seal coolant. Reroute power to cargo hold. Send distress call. Check shields..." he repeated, this time in Basic.

The wookie remained silent. He knew his strengths and helping aboard a starship was definitely not one of them. He was good at noticing things, listening, and he could mend an injury or three, but working mechanical devices, computers, etc. gave him a headache. Woroken decided he could help the most by getting his large, furry frame out of everyone's way, and making sure the unknown tie fighter did not try any "funny stuff." Therefore he stuck close by the helmeted pilot.

"I can check the computers to make sure, but I doubt the computer voice was exaggerating when it said all the unused escape pods had already been jettisoned," Radon immediately replied. That was the one thing that had drawn him to study the droids and computers that lined the garage of his podracer down on the surface: unlike people, he'd never met a computer that thought up a lie on it's own.
"I saw the cockpit," he admitted. "The pilots were shot in the back. I couldn't tell if they were alive or dead from the camera angle but, in the state they're in, I don't believe they'd still be able to fly this ship even if they're still breathing."

Feeling calm enough to take a glance back, he sees Woroken and Vor'en personally attending to the Imperial. He nodded at the two 'bodyguards', feeling all that safer walking in front of the TIE pilot and the pilot-suited man's two large blaster pistols. *"Good. That 's one less thing I have to think about,"* he told himself.

Caught off guard at the sudden introductions from some of these strange people the Pilot stops short in his tracks, unable to grasp immediatley what he should say. After giving it a second thought the Pilot faces the young farghul who from what he can tell is the only one who does not want to kill him and in some sense may have saved his life... or theirs. As angry as he was he could not deny what she had done. Pride and anger aside the Pilot decided he would respect her greeting. Perhaps it was time she saw him for what he was. A human, a filthy human, a choice not his own. But it was a burden he would have to live with. As the pilot removed the helmet, there was a faint hiss as the suit depressurized. As he pulled the helmet off a face was revealed, but not what would be expected. A young unblemished face, scarrless and perfect. flowing mettalic silver hair, almost glowing in the dim light of the hall, fells to the Pilot's back. Squinting eyes hiding blood rep pupils locked on to the farghul's face. "My name... my name is Rith. Rith... Bendar, born of Coruscant. Im sorry to say that I cant remember much aside from that. "And if I may ask, seeing as how you all are no longer trying to end my life, what the Frag is going on!?"

Ben turns for a second to look at the pilot, but then continues walking. "Nice to meet you Rith. Well, an *unkown* imperial sabatoure docked on this ship, and killed all the pilots so that his friends, a few tie fighters, could attack it. We don't know why since this is a fairly peacefull vessel, carrying hunters on a scientific mission. We found you unconcious in this hallway. We are going to try and get to the command deck to regain control of this ship, since there might not be any escape pods left. Have fun. By the way, how much room is there inside a tie fighter?"
Ben whispers to Radon who is at his side "I have a great idea, get me to the docking bay and I'll pilot the tie fighter and take out the tie fighters. The first one should be easy as lube, since they won't expect it. Then if you could aid me with a gunner, we can take out the second and pilot this thing to safety." Ben knows he doesn't have any real chance to take out the second, but he owes it to the Red team to try, since he's been so much trouble for them.

However, as Vor'en is going to the weapons, he informs him that the schematic of the ship shows no weapons. Reluctantly, Vor'en falls in with the group and they begin ascending the ladder.

Radon looking both ways of the hall before stepping off the ladder and motioning for the tohers to follow. He leads the way to the doors of the cockpit and stops, the group reaches him and Awne motions quietly for everyone to get ready just in case. The group nods, those with blasters take up a defence, Radon and Ben on the left of the door, Vor'en and Rith on the right, with Woroken and Awne standing just to the side of each group respectivly, out of the way of the door but preparied to take down anyone that thinks they can get past them.

Radon quickly puts his finger to his mouth to tell everyone to keep quiet, then cupping his hand over his ear to signal that he was going to listen in. With them so close to their objective, there was no way he was going to tell everyone to move back down. Of course, that didn't mean he was going to be careless about moving forward. He clung to the ladder, keeping still, watching and listening to the droids to the best of his ability. He was trying to figure what they were doing there, why they were moving so much, and why there were a number of them. Radon knew droids weren't programmed to harm people, but there was always a first time.
*"Speak, little droids, come on now. Tell me what's wrong,"* Radon caught himself silently wishing. It was one of those times he was thankful he could understand droid-speak, as well as one of those times he regretted passing up that cheap second-hand ion pistol a Jawa once tried to sell him.

Ben moves up past Radon and enters the hallway carefully. If the droids do not react he tries to get a good view of the droids *perception +7*. If he can't see anything he tries to get closer but only as close as he deems safe *Stealth +8*. If they notice him then depending on how they act he will act accordingly.

Radon shows the others four of his fingers, indicating that he heard 4 different droids manning the entryway. He keeps where he is, pondering if he should try to sneak in, hoping someone else had any thoughts on how to get in. He wasn't confident of his own ability to hide, as his first act in such a situation would have been to run. In this case, backwards wasn't an option.
Then he noticed Ben gesture to himself then into the entryway. Radon nodded in consent, hoping the other native knew was he was doing. In any case, if his plan was to come in shooting, Ben's blaster looked a lot more capable of doing that than his own. He waved to the others to let Ben through.
As soon as Ben makes it past him and begins to implement his plan, Radon secures himself back onto the ladder, hoping Ben wouldn't start a firefight.

Awne looks up seeing Ben pass Radon and looks back down motioning for the human and wookiee to get into a more comfortable position for this part, she unwraps her tail from her waist and wraps it around a rung on the ladder for support.

Woroken was not in a good position to see what was happening on the ladder above him. His vision to the top was blocked by 4 humans and a Farghul. He was able to make out Radon and Ben switching places on the ladder. He assumed it was almost time for a fight, seeing Ben going forward, and seeing the podracer moving away from the action. Although they had only know each other for roughly a day and a half, Woroken knew Radon was no fan of battle.
The wookie knew one thing, though: he was no help on this ladder. His spear was broken, and he could not use his bowcaster while holding onto the ladder. Already, he wished that he and Awne had blasters, as neither of them would be able to help in a firefight from this position. Even a grenade would make him feel better. "If we make it off this ship alive," Woroken decided, "We have to find more weapons."

Radon feels the pilot brush past him on the ladder, with the Imperial's blaster in hand. *"What the…"*
Before he could say anything, Rith tells them to stay back. *"Oh, come on, does everyone know what to do but me?"* he thinks to himself. Despite his exasperation, he keeps still. It seemed like everyone beside him, Woroken and Awne (who had no blasters he could see) was intent on shooting. His was not a good position to be in. He gritted his teeth, focusing on what seemed like an impending rush into the eighth floor, in order to duck behind the nearest plasteel bin he could get to.

Normally, the wookie would have made an attempt to catch the pilot. Not this time. Woroken was not particularly fond of the tie pilot. Woroken was also not particularly fond of dangling from a ladder. This action by thte pilot killed two tauntauns with one blast, so to speak. If there was fire, the pilot would draw at least the first round of blasts. During this round, hopefully soem of the team could get themselves to cover, off the ladder. If there were no shots fired, then everyone could get off the ladder. Sounded like a plan to the wookie.

Radon looks between the rungs to see Awne clinging on the other side.

He thumbs his nose at Rith and Ben before whispering back, "We'll know as soon as those two get in there. Either they'll call us up, or we'll hear blaster fire."
Oh, how we wished it wouldn't be blaster fire.

Rith climbs past the group, pauses just at the entry way, then boldy rushes into the eighth floor with his blaster pistol drawn. As soon as he gets to the eighth floor, the corridor seems exactly the same as the others. But he sees four maintenace droids mobilized by tracks. Two of them are heading right, unaware of Rith. The other two spot him immediately and begin closing distance on him, they are about 3 squares away on his left facing him. The droids have a bulky body that are gray and multiple appendages with tools. The heads are circular with blue-dot eyes and rough cone shaped noses. They appear to be maintenance droids. There are plasteel bins all along the walls, going down the length of the corridor. Rith can see the cockpit door about 20 squares behind the droids facing him.
*The two droids facing away are surprised. Combat has begun and this is the surprise round. The two droids three squares away are not surprised. Rith is not surprised. The two droids roll for initative. 15+16=31.The other players on the ladder cannot act this round.*

The two droids close distance quickly on Rith, their hydrospanner arms outstretched, sparks flying out of them. "Guard the Cockpit!", the droid commands. The droid on the left attacks Rith. *16 and beats Rith's defense. Rith takes five damage.*. The droid on the right waits for the left droid's attack to end, then he pokes at Rith with his spanner. *The droid got a one.*  The droid reaches and overextends himself, it falls flat on it's body.

Radon sees the Imperial practically leap into the eighth floor and scream in fury. *"Oh, great,"* he comments to himself. *"The man doesn't like being threatened, and yet he acts suicidal. Go figure."*
Despite his seemingly care-free thoughts, Radon's heart starts to step up the pace of it's beating. It wasn't a good feeling, and one that Radon had not wanted to feel for a long time. He never felt safe shooting anything outside of a movie set, and this was real. He didn't know if he had it in him to really fire his blaster, even though they were facing droids and not people. Danger was still danger, risk was still risk, and injury, whether from a blaster shot or a metal tool, was still a step towards death.
"I don't like the sound of that..." he heard Awne say in front of him, as he heard the sound of metal hitting... something. Radon's body began to shake lightly, rattling the ladder with miniscule vibrations.
*Initiative +7 for the next round.*

The wookie was glad he had moved up last round, as now that battle was joined, he needed to get there fast. He scrambled up the ladder, saw the close quarters scene developing. "No room for bowcasters here--let's get up close and personal!" he thought. The wookie pulled what was left of his spear, grabbbed it in both large paws and attempts to set up a flank with one of the Red team, attempting to locate a droid that the Red team has not engaged.
*Climbing is move action and pulling my spear is another move action. I would like to flank an open droid.*

Awne gets out of the entry way right after Bennosuke, she strafes left and attacks Bennosuke's droid diagonal to it.

*I was actually waiting for Woroken and Vor'en's turns as per initiative order, but I guess that means they can't move because I'm ahead on the ladder. In any case, I can imagine the immediate combat area, but I can't imagine the rest of the corridor, so here's my two combat options:
If there's a path that will allow Radon to double-move (12 squares) towards the cockpit door without passing through any of the droid's threat areas, he'll take it, and try to end up beside whatever bins he can find on the way. He'll end his turn by using a swift action to go to a sitting position against the wall or bins.
If there's no such path, Radon will just move to the other side of the ladder, so that Woroken and Vor'en can climb up ahead of him.
In either case, he's not going to join the melee.*

Radon peaks past the entry way. He sees Red Team in a toe to toe fight with the droids. Metallic clanking, grunting, and the sounds of blaster fire echo through the hallway. With each blaster shot, it adds more light to the corridor and people's shadows can be seen on the wall. He sees a straight shot to the left of the group fighting, and sprints desperately for the cockpit. He stops and kneels behind a cargo crate. The cockpit is about another dash away.

The droids that are still left standing seem to show no regard for their fallen brethren, other than they must kill the one who is destroying the most of them. The droid swings his hydrospanner at Rith and misses completely. The second droid shot at by Vor'en attacks Rith and misses. The droids let out a furious collection of whirs and beeping at their lack of combat ability.
Bennosuke kinda chuckles as the hydrospanners do not connect with their imperial target. He digs his heels in and lunges forward with a vibrodagger at the droid he attacked before and misses. Awne, seeing Ben miss, attempts to assist him by slashing with her vibrodagger and sends it toppling over...disabled. *Awne gains 50 experience.*
Woroken uses the remnant of his spear to swing at the only droid left standing. He swings at the top of his head and the droid rolls back just a bit and evades the attack.*Anyone who engages this final droid gets -5 to attack with ranged. The droid is in melee with Woroken.*

Radon covers his ears as he runs away from the blaster fire behind him, thinking only of getting as far away from there as possible. He reaches the door, only slightly confident that he's out of danger, and focuses on the task at hand. Despite the anxiety he was feeling from the 'rush' of battle, he has enough presence of mind to draw his blaster as a precaution, hoping he wouldn't have a reason to shoot through the doorway - or for there to be something that shoots back. Keeping his survival in mind as he had been since he regained consciousness, Radon hugs the side of the door as he taps the control panel to access the cockpit.

The droid senses the attack and rolls to the side, Rith barely missing Awne.
Vor'en brings up his blaster sights and carefully aims at the droid. He shoots the droid center mass and it topples over. All the droids have been destroyed.
Radon opens the door, and walks into the cockpit. He sees the dead pilots are bleeding out from the back. The controls are flashing, signaling the deflector shields are almost out. In the viewport, you see the ship moving on a dead set course to Tatooine. Otherwise, the cockpit seems intact and undamaged. You cannot see the TIE fighters but you hear their blaster shots still pounding the hull. The cockpit is quite small for a ship this size, but Radon can easily get around in it.
*Posted under Rith, he is using my computer. You are all got flank bonuses and melee penalties for ranged attacks. Vor'en gains 50 experience for finishing the droid off. Everyone gains 200 experience for the encounter success.*

He wished the fight behind him had already ended, as he sorely needed help here.

Ben wipes the turns of his vibroblad and wipes the greace off on his pants before cliping it back to his belt. He runs to Radon to see what is in teh control room. If Radon has already used the computer ben asks "What can I do." Otherwise he runs to the ships command center to see if the control board is still working and if he can figure out how to work the ship. He also tries to get a radar schematic as to where the tie's are and a shield output schematic so that he can angle the deflector shields and start evasive manouvars. *Computer and Pilot +8*

Woroken, while not cluttering up the cain by wading in, takes a peek at the bodies of the dead pilots. First, he wants to determine if they are dead, or if they are merely critically wounded, and had a chance to be healed. Secondly, Woroken has realized both he and Awne need more weaponry. If they have pistols, the wookie would like to get one for himself and one for his feline friend.

Rith looks at the blaster pistol and determines it has no modifications. He tells you that it is a Scout Blaster pistol, and it is also considered a hold-out blaster. It is a popular pistol for the imperials. He also tells you that this compact, one-handed blaster was fitted with a side-mounted targeting scope and phase amplifier, and featured a miniature gas cell on the rear.

*Character sheet posted as per instructions.*
As Radon looks over the readout of the main terminal, he clenches his fist. Half of what he hoped to accomplish seemed impossible now, but he knows that he has to succeed with the others. The ship was too damaged to stay flying, so all could do now was to make sure the circumstances were favorable for a crash landing. Sensing Bennouske get into the cockpit in his peripheral vision, he called the other native over.
"Bennouske, the comm systems are over here. Try to get it working. We still need to send out a distress call and warn those people in the main hold. Also, the coolant can't be sealed from here - the doors on the engine deck have to be repaired manually to get them closed."
Hearing the shuffling of more feet on metal, and the voice of the irritating Imperial, Radon continued, "Imperial! We can't avoid a crash landing, so get yourself in that pilot's chair! I'm switching control to manual now - I hope you passed this particular course in the Navy."
Without looking away from the console, Radon started tapping in the commands to give flap and fin control to the pilot. As soon as he could make sure of that, he then switched on one of monitors to tap into the main hold camera, so he could begin to solve the problem of the trapped diplomat and the child, trying to get the door to the main hold working again.

Radon manages to catch Vor'en's voice behind him as he works. Then it hits him. Maybe there was still a small glimmer of hope after all.
He turns around, and looks at the old soldier with concern through both of his green and blue eyes. "Soldier," he addressed him professionally, "I need you to rescue that diplomat and the child still trapped in the main hold. Take Awne with you, in case you run into any more--"
But before he could finish, the ship took a hit and shook. Radon instinctively outstretched his hands, trying to grab on to the nearest support he could reach.

Red Team fights to stay stabilized as the ship is rocking uncontrollably. The ship moves forward and you are all leaning against the pull to be knocked over. Awne slides underneath the cockpit and bumps her head...knocking her out. Radon falls into the viewport itself and collapses. Bennosuke can't stay balanced and he just falls over, then slides into the wall...knocking him out as well. After a few seconds the ship levels out partially, but you still must walk on an incline.

The wookie had been at teh controls of a ship before, but was certainly no expert. Woroken reviews the controls and control panel, checking to see what information he can glean. All he knew was that the planet's surface was fastly approaching, and he needed to pull the ship out of its freefall.

Radon feels himself knocked down to the plasteel viewport of the ship itself. However, he manages to stay barely conscious enough to be awakened completely by the smelling salts. He blinks, seeing the furry hand of the wookiee waving the salt as he finds himself sitting with his bottom practically on the controls. To the podracer, that only meant one thing: the ship was in a dive.
Gathering his wits, he hears the wookiee screaming for a pilot. He tries to get up despite his disorientation, and makes his way to the other pilot's seat. He could see the wookiee trying his best to get a hold of the controls, but it was obvious to him that Woroken was inexperienced, at best. But Radon - he knew he was worse. Although the controls of a ship had always looked familiar to him, he had *absolutely no experience* in flying one, as his fame meant that he was always the passenger, and never the starship pilot. That was the main reason he had decided against shooting the Imperial outright - seeing as how Rith was wearing a TIE pilot's uniform, no one else looked qualified to fly the transport. Too bad that before the ship shook, the Imperial had the audacity to accost him and leave the cockpit, such that Rith's mistakenly placed air of righteousness blinded him as to why Radon had been ordering him to take the pilot's seat in the first place, thereby endangering them further.
He could see the familiar atmosphere of Tatooine outside now, and while half of his being told him it would be the last thing he would see in his short life, the other half - the half that had always guided him for survival - ordered him to strap himself into seat.
"I-I've never flown a s-starship before," he admitted softly as he put his shaking hands on the controls. The far sight of the ground seemingly closing in on him made him start to panic, but he fought the feeling. Although he didn't like trust anyone with his life, he knew that he owed part of his continued survival on the ship to the efforts of the others, and now Woroken, who had helped him twice now, was counting on him.
"D-Don't worry, b-big guy, I-I'll figure this out," he said, grinning widely. "A-After all, t-this baby is just one b-big p-podracer!" he yelled, as he forced himself into 'the zone'. If he failed, he was at least going to make sure he enjoyed the last few moments of his life.

"Now he tells me!" Woroken, while saying nothing outwardly, felt a lurch in his stomach. The wookie belts himself in, and decides to give Radon moral support if nothing else. "Be strong..you can do this," Woroken tells Radon. While he knew he could help Awne and Ben awaken, it would do them much more good if the starship didn't crash into Tatooine, even if they took a few bumps and bruises in the process.

Radon frantically taps the buttons to the ship's controls. He sees a damage report flash on a screen to his right, the ship has been severed in half...and you are all on the front half of the ship. Casualties are heavy within the ship and life support is barely being held in throughout the front of the ship. Radon estimates this to be a deadly crash, and his skills are going to make a minute difference. He can merely guide the ship in for a crash landing. He types in the estimated crash course of where they are going to land...the safest place seems to be in the center of a canyon. It will crash in miles of sand, it should cushion the ship enough to have some people survive. He punches in the coordinates so that the ship may auto-guide it in enough where he can land it with the control stick. He grabs the stick to keep the ship level and tells somebody to do what they can to repair the drive fins. *Radon you need to make another pilot check, and if anyone can repair anything to the ship…now is the time to do so.

"B-Ben! V-Vor'en! S-Someone get those d-drive fins w-working!" he screams, as he readies himself for the eventual crash landing. It doesn't escape him that the first time he flies a transport, he's crashing it. He decides, maybe belatedly, that podracers weren't as dangerous to pilot as starships.

Woroken uses the smelling salt that has already been opened. Bad move, his lack of experience in this part of medicine made him pay the price. It wasn't enough to wake Bennosuke up.
Radon pulls the control stick back to level the ship out for the landing. He pours all his strength into it to level the ship out for the crash. Radon pulls more and more...**SNAP**. The control stick breaks and it flings back out of his hand. The stick lands right right next to Woroken. Emergency lights blink on and off in the cockpit.

Woroken pulls a smelling salt pill out of his second medpac. He uses it on Bennosuke and he awakes, very startled as to what is going on.
Meanwhile, Radon sits in the co-pilot's chair and remembers back to his podracing days. He really needed to slow the ship's descent and that would require all the flaps be extended at this point. What would he do now? Ahh, he had encountered a similar situation before! He fired a blaster round into the control panel on its edges. He then pried the plate off in a hurry. He yanked some wires out and located the wiring for the flaps and drive fins. He took the wiring from the life support, which had the most power, and tied the wiring to the drive fins and flaps. On the status screen, you see an overview of what is left of the ship, and all the flaps/fins are extended...drastically improving the landing speed. However, there is nothing more Radon can do. He estimates it would be best to strap everyone's crash webbing in before it is too late.

*"Wouldn't be the first time a blaster shot saves my life,"* Radon thinks to himself as he kicks in the flaps and steadies what remained of the ship. However, with half the ship gone, the landing still wouldn't be as smooth as anyone would like. It was time to assume the crash position.
"Everyone strap yourselves in! We're going down hard!" he screams, hopefully not for the last time.

*Rith's Treat Injury 18+6=24 and he gains 50 experience. All Awne's hit points are restored.*
Rith kneels next to Awne, struggling to keep his balance. He takes out a medpac and applies bacta to Awne's temples to soothe the head trauma. He then ties a bandage around the top of her head. After all this, he pulls out smelling salt and wakes her.

Woroken helps Ben to his feet and makes sure he is strapped in. Woroken looks around to be sure everyone is belted in before finally webbing himself in, preparing for the inevitable.
*I think everyone is okay and strapped in. I would imagine we can assume that Vor'en belts himself in as well.*

"What happened?" Ben asks confused. After survaying the situation Ben yells to Radon, "Do you want a copilot?" he asks. *If accepted Ben's pilot is +8 and will use a force point. If Ben can't help he stays put, wishing Radon good luck!*

*Radon's second-to-last pilot check broke the other controls, so just strap Ben in and cross your fingers. <!– s:lol: –>![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!– s:lol: –>*

Awne moans as she sits up slowly holding her head "What the hell?" She looks around at the sound of the ship rumbling and alarms going off "oh you've got to be kidding.." she jump up and pulls the imperials hand moving to a webbing and pushing the imperial into it then herself strapping them both in. *'Grreat way to starrt an adventurre'* she thinks.

After strapping himself in Rith leans over to Awne and asks if she is alright. "Don't die, you are the only one with any sense of reason in this group." "It would be a shame to go out like this."

A smile creased Rith's face. The first smile since he awoke to find blasters in his face. The ordeal had been strange, still not fully aware of all that had transpired and unable to remember what had brought him up to this point the smile faded quickly. Had he carried this memory of that girl all this time? Who was she, and why did she make his soul sadden at the very thought of her name? Rith glanced at the floor then back to Awne. "Sounds good." the smile creeping back across his face.

Each member of Red Team finds a seat and straps themselves in. Everyone has noticed the ship has slowed substantially, but it is still quite the violent ride. You hear objects in the cockpit vibrating uncontrollably as you can see nothing but the tan backdrop of Tatooine quickly closing towards the viewport. As you watch through the viewport, it seems like you are going through a nightmare, you can't believe you are about to crash like this. You want to close your eyes and pretend this isn't happening, but the violent rumbling of the ship will not allow such fantasies.
Computerized voice: "1000 meters to impact."
This was it, possibly the last moments of your life. As soft as sand is, it didn't look very welcoming at this speed. It's day time right now, and you hope that you'll live to see another night. A lot of thoughts pass through your mind all at once. This was some hunt....and everything went black.
*Go to chapter 2.*
