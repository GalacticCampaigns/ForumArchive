# OOC Section

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-06-30 05:51:14)

The place to keep all the OOC stuff that don´t belong in the game thread.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-03 00:39:21)

Kurrsk is a big Trandoshan wearing "re-purposed" Ubese armor, complete with voice modulator and filter mask. I will defer to the GM whether he thinks people can still recognize that I'm a Trandoshan and not an Ubese.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-03 01:17:52)

I didn't know if any of the other characters were going to be human or not, but if so, and you want it, feel free to 'be' that human that my Duros Deeg just sat next to and bought a drink.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-03 14:15:05)

Deeg seemed too wary for me to try my *mind trick* thing on him. but he probably sees the the big "Ubese" in the slightly ill-fitting armor approaching the drunk Aqualish. Maybe the guy is actually being pursued by bounty hunters... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-04 21:25:54)

So where is everyone else? Chop chop! Lets get this ball rolling!

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-05 14:07:20)

Agreed! We waited and waited for those folks who were supposedly soooo busy. I'm glad that time has really paid off!

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-10 07:11:22)

Ok, just so we are clear on this, everyone knows the difference between PC and NPC, right? The "N" basically means that the character is **N**ot under your control as a player. And if it isn´t found in the thread for PC characters sheets, then it´s an NPC.
I just want to make it clear from the beginning that I expect you to understand the simple deal that "Players control their PCs, the GM controls everything else in the world"

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-10 17:37:57)

Yeah that's on me...I was just trying to speed my thread along so my little scam didn't unnecessarily dominate too much... Sorry. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-10 22:10:00)

There IS a limit to that don't you think? I hardly pushed those bounds with my post about the other person, yet I suppose even in what I posted I did a bit of NPC pushing, as it were. I only mention it because what goes on around us is very detailed and it would be burdensome to wait for every detail to be described before we did anything beyond our own actions. For example, if I get in a taxi, do I REALLY have to wait for the cabbie to talk to me before I tell him where I want to go? Anyway, NPC - PC delineations noted.

Naturally nothing is set in stone. Assuming here is at least one individual in a large cantina that one can sit down next to and offer a drink is not unreasonable at all, nor is the notion that there might be an Aqualish in there that one can harass. However, were you to start directing the reactions of such NPCs to your actions, then yes, that would annoy me. Just as an absurd example, the guy you so kindly offered a drink might be a super paranoid spice addict thinking you mean to poison him, causing him to attack you on sight. Now that is a bit of a stretch even for me to come up with, but I hope you get the point - I might be going for establishing a certain setting and feeling, which it is pretty easy for you to ruin. If you were to, say, describe the human next to you as responding politely and trying to strike up some kind of intelligent conversation with you...then you have effectively done that yourself...and then the whole scene might shift into a tone and feel I did not intend and that will make something I have planned work less well. Not sure if those were the best examples, but I hope the meaning gets through.
And well, I do in fact expect you to wait for the cabbie to ask you were you are going, at least if your character wants to wait for the question. The alternative would of course be to just jump in and tell him where you want to go. However, if such a scene comes up, I would most likely end my post with the cabbie asking you where you want to go after he pulls up next to you, just to effectivise things a bit.
I don´t mean to point at anyone, and so far no one has done anything that have seriously annoyed me, but I just think I should get the point out early.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-16 22:34:43)

I don't want to belabor the point but did they agree to the "bring 'em back alive bonus"?

I think it was lost in conversation somewhere. Or just ignored, who knows.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-17 06:07:43)

It would seem so... (To the other PC's) do we want to ask for a bonus upon completion? No leverage if the job has already been completed...

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-17 12:40:09)

Sure. Nothing ventured nothing gained.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-17 16:59:14)

So, unless we get messed with can we assume we get some food and drink (someone else is buying)...get a bit better acquainted with our new crew members and we pick up the next scene at Gert's?
So, are we all gonna eat that Bog-rat after we get paid or just Kurrsk?
After we gear up,
1) we'll need to do some gather info to see where this guy is being held;
2) gather info/computer hacking about when and where any imperial shuttle are scheduled to land tomorrow around noon;
3) we'll need more info about who has the Cook and where, when and how he is being delivered and by whom;
4) then we send false info another superior Hutt thinks there's a "fly in the ointment" so they send new rendezvous info to the delivery squad;
5) we meet them, gank the delivery people and take our prize...or...
6) we deliver our prize and decide that Imperial problems with the HUtts makes for good merc work so we also attack the Imp shuttle and its crew...that pisses them off and they retaliate...chaos ensues and Ak'Kra'Far is pleased... <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Deeg can afford to eat if our hosts don't throw it in "on the house."
Deeg won't be eating any bog-rat. Have no love for the thing but also not on the Duros' menu.
1)Gm want us to roll these here or in the main thread?
2) samequestion
3) samequestion
4) Main thread, but will it need skill checks to see if it works? And if it don't, fallout?
5) like this one better than
6) no sense pissing on where we might be getting paid later. Let everyone except the deceased love us for now. Chaos is ok, good to capitalize on, but... don't burn bridges we might want to cross later, eh?
A lot will depend on the results of the rolls for gather information and use computer (I only have ranks in the latter).

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-18 07:34:33)

Just a heads up.
Internet and power where I am are spotty.
There might be delays in my postings.
Sorry!

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-19 10:57:09)

Just a question, why would you roll anything here?

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-19 12:32:53)

Since Kup may still be having technical probs, should we start the next scene at Gert's?

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-20 02:16:01)

> **DarthAnthrax wrote:**
>

Just finding out where things go on. Some GMs don't like the die rolls to mess up the flow of the text, and have die rolls elsewhere.
Just asking before there's a miscue.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-20 12:11:21)

Power and internet is back.
Anyway, a gather info i indeed what we need at the moment. We can actually make a cooperation roll to find the info we need.
For starters, perhaps we could request access to our employers computers to do some HoloNet scanning. Since we're in the bar, we could request food and drinks be served there so we can work while we eat.
If we can't find any info in the HoloNet, we've got to do the ol' legwork.
What do you guys think?

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-20 12:22:33)

Sounds good! Let's do it.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-20 13:22:29)

Yep, sounds like a plan.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-22 05:11:58)

Hey DA, if Kup's guy is good to go, can he post it in the character sheet section? It'll be easier to find (and refer to)... <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Yeah, he sent me a PM about it...it´s on my todo list, though not very highly prioritized at the moment.
Also, I´ve been going through the thread, and can´t seem to find anywhere it would have been implied you have any kind of access to a computer terminal inside that room. Did I miss something?

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-22 21:27:36)

Yeah, I think the Holonet talk got that started. If no terminal, no biggie. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-23 00:53:43)

Might be my fault, I just assumed a data terminal would be easy to find, get onto. If not available, we can move to another location after the meal.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-23 05:39:24)

So, are you guys going to edit your posts?

No. I think I'm alright. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I'm ok with it if the GM is.

Well, first off, you were in a place where there were some possible room for roleplaying between characters. In such places, I tend to wait a little to give you the opportunity to do so.
Second, I´m not sure you realize this, but the pace we had in the beginning is rather fast by PbP standards, and it was largely due to me having a lot of time on my hands. During periods where I have less time on my hands, things will progress slower.
I´ll have something up tomorrow probably.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-30 01:06:40)

Ok, cool. Responses did seem quick but I just assumed we were all kinda "into this" and therefore we're making the time. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I was concerned maybe I'd stepped on a toe perhaps... <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Nah, I was just a bit swamped, that´s all. Though you´re always free to roleplay as much as you want.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-06 00:24:34)

Yea but I don't want to say or do anything that would be godmoding.

### **Isamu** (2014-08-10 22:36:46)

DA, I don't know if you saw or not, but I posted a character for your approval over in the casting call thread.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-08-11 00:26:54)

I'm cool with him joining but I don't think any of us relish the idea of going back to those dicks who hired us and asking that Zel should be included in the 25k a head mission completion bonus or the 15k bonus if we return the Cook for "justice."
Then again we might need an extra gun when they try to bone us [instead of bonus <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->] and we need to bring some vengeance down on those douches!
On another note, didn't that ship that Gert is working on almost call to us? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-11 02:20:29)

I'm definitely ok with another character in the fray.
GM can poof the changes for my opinion.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-08-11 03:15:17)

I second the poof!

---

### **Isamu** (2014-08-11 07:41:07)

fortunately Zel is exactly the kind of person one would expect to run into at a starport, so I don't think going back to the cantina is necessary. Also, He has his own set of motivations I can use to include him in the party, so you guys don't even have to renegotiate the terms of the deal you made (I'm not interested in rehashing any of that stuff any more than you guys are). I think some good RP can sort it all out.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-08-29 13:46:07)

Anodyzed, I'll need a little more than that for a skill check. Also I'll be busy in the weekend, so expert an update no earlier than Sunday evening.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-30 00:09:24)

Didn't know if you wanted more rolls (done) or specifically what Deeg is looking for (some done).
That's the trouble with an INT 12 player trying to think for an INT 16 character.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-08-30 08:37:20)

Maybe Vallat could also make an attempt on the Computer Skill Check.

Basically just some more information on what you are looking for. Not only is it good from a roleplaying perspective, but the rules also sets different DC/time requirements depending on the nature of the information you are looking for.
It´s fine to play a character smarter than you are, but without any indication of what you are looking for at all, I feel it becomes more of a metagame where I decide your plan for you by giving you the information that I would have been looking for if I were the player.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-09-05 10:34:33)

We've ground to a halt once again. Can we not all find 20 minutes each week so that we can have 2 responsive cycles each week? It's frustrating to check this site every day and find nothing new. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->

Aah, you see, now this is my fault again. I check on every other day or so, though I just looks for new posts. And edits apparently don´t show up as new posts. I really should be smart enough to check the thread when I´m waiting for an edit, but just to make sure, please make a note here or something if you edit a post.
Sorry for the delay

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-05 20:06:57)

There we go.
Just a heads up for future skill use, the OOC section (spoiler tag which you preferably locate at the bottom of the post) is a good place to put in some OOC comments, like some more detail of what you are trying to accomplish. Especially, you can use it to clarify more mechanical aspects of your skill use (which skill application you are using, or a more elaborate description of what you want to do that you are having a hard time formulating for the RP section), as well as contain any rolls.
As an example, Anodyzed made three Use Computer checks, and judging from his post I´m guessing they were all for searching for information (the Access Information application of the Use Computer skill), so that´s what I used them for. On the other hand, if there was only really one piece of information he was after, and the other two rolls were to try and hack the system or something else, then he would note that by labeling the rolls.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-09-05 21:54:59)

Noted. Makes sense.
And in this case yes, it was all searches. Didn't think about hacking their system.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-10 18:26:50)

Just had some timely broadband outage, but now things seems to be back online...but that was ok, since I needed to consider some things though.
I just felt like I had to remind people that data searches aren´t instantaneous. And you are having Deeg do no less than six, of which I deem that at least the majority (if not all of them, still deciding on that) would be classified as "Private" information in the rulebook. This means that you will have at the very least 3-4 hours to complete all your data searches, probably more.
I´m not saying you can´t do it, I actually applaud your ingeniuty and hope to see creative planning like this throughout the campaign, I just wanna make sure you realize that doing things takes time.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-22 15:13:06)

Heh, sorry Anodyzed if that last update seemed a bit lackluster...
I was just making something quick to give Kups and Fax another chance to try and do something at all. I´ll check in shortly to see if anything has happened, and otherwise I guess they´ll just stand there as Deeg spends a few hours on the computer <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-09-22 20:30:04)

I would think his searches on the computer were 'interactive' with his associates making suggestions and comments about what looked promising to run down leads. I didn't really think he was just squirreled away ignoring everyone in his solitary 'online' quest. Didn't think it was lackluster. Knowing the searches were going to take hours put it in perspective. No data pad from the big guy, then we'll have to stand around here and hog his terminal.
Will make it a point for the future to come up with a decent datapad somehow though... hehehe

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-09-28 21:18:32)

I just checked Wookieepedia. It turns out the visual wristcomm is also a datapad. It didn't say if it could run programs but it did state it can connect to computer networks.
Nonetheless, I'll need your adjudication on this DA.
If it can't do a data search, I'll just edit my post.
Thanks! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-29 20:12:40)

It´s a communications device - its primary function is to allow communication. The "datapad" functionality, I assume would be limited to its capacity to receive and store data from other sources. For example, compare the cost (1300 Cr) to similar devices (Simple Datapad + Wrist-sized Long-range comm = 1100 Cr) and then consider the differences (VWC has shorter range, but combines the devices without the 1000 Cr Dual Gear Mod and can be attached to any surface).
So in short, no it´s not a small computer.

Just as a heads up, I´ll be away over the weekend, so won´t make any updates until most likely early Monday or possibly late Sunday.
Personally, you seem to be in a place where you have some talking to do, but I usually try to move things along any way after a while if nothing happens.

I'll be away from my home computer for the next week. SHould have some internet access, but not sure how much so my ability to get on may be jeopardized.
If I don't post when it is NECESSARY, feel free to NPC me for what is needed til I can get back on.

I'm home and have been for a couple weeks. I check the site daily, sometimes more than once a day, so few posts get by me.
That said, if I don't reply to a post its for one of the following reasons: Don't know what to say, Don't have anything to say, Waiting for someone else to participate.
That's probably true of everyone, but better said than assumed right?
Sometimes I just don't know where else to take a storyline!

Yeah, I check in daily too (usually, though occasionally every other day), but I try to space out my postings to make sure everyone gets a chance to get in. Sometimes though, I get delayed a day or so if I have much to do.

I don't know if there are privately practicing lawyers or whatever you call someone who defends the rights of others in Star Wars. Our toons could pretend to be one or representing such group. Perhaps they could make up one since those inside seems like intellectually challenged.
As an alternative, Vallat could transform into a hot chick and seduce the leader of the crew.
Either way, the group would eventually be needing a place to stay for the night.

Been a month since the last post...
where are we DA? If you're waiting for us, we clearly need a bump.

I'm still around...

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-12-22 07:32:11)

Still here as well.

Probably not an issue, considering the last month,
but I'll be visiting my daughter for the next five days and not have game(internet) access during that time.
Merry Christmas to you all,'

Don't know about the others but I haven't.
I check every day to see if there's anything new.

### **KUPALISSSS** (2015-01-17 14:17:51)

Still here.
Haven't tried sending DA a PM either.

### **Fax Ardo** (2015-01-21 05:03:35)

Me either. I figured if he was into it he'd show up...
