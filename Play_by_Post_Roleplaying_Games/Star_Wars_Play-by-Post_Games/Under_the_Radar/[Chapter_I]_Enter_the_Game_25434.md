# [Chapter I] Enter the Game

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-06-30 16:41:12)

*Hutta
Or to be precise, Nal Hutta, meaning "glorious jewel" in the tongue of its native gangster rulers. Why then, one might wonder, do so many prefer to visit and inhabit it´s smaller and more infamous moon? The answer is simple: Only a species who are basically enormous slugs would consider using the word "glorious" to describe a vast world of swamps, toxic fumes, and hostile wildlife. For those living on the more shadowy side of the Galaxy though, Hutta - as well as its moon - has a lot to offer. And it is here you have been drawn by the mysterious transmission that somehow managed to find its way into your possession, untraceable and anonymous…*
It is growing to be late in the afternoon, though it is difficult to tell by the naked eye. Toxic fumes and pollution from the nearby factories in Bilbousa are playing tricks with the sunlight. One way to tell though is the increasing traffic coming into the *Lizard´s Breath* cantina, and the increasing volume and temperature inside. The place is filled with beings from all walks of life, from all species and professions, though a slight over-representation can be seen of Klatoonians - most likely in employment of the various local Hutts - and the native Evocii. Twi'Leks, Zeltrons and even a Faleen woman can be seen running around serving the patrons, all watched over by a black-furred Shistavanen residing mainly behind the bar or moving to and from the back rooms.

Moving through this throng of living decadence, Deeg makes his way with confidence to a table on the far side of the Lizard’s Breath Cantina. Finding a table with an unoccupied chair, he’ll sit, and after a short stare at the other chair, occupied by a human with no distinguishing features, he’ll turn to watch the crowd.
Watching the crowd wasn’t always what he did, but there was a time when he was paid for it, and knew what he was watching for. Usually, it had been for the mark, once identified for the pluck by his boss, that no-name minor slug who wanted to be in the swamp like the big Hutts.
Well, his days of working for that Hutt came to an end. He didn’t owe the slimeball anything, so he’d just walked away when the time was right. Of course, that meant he had no ship now, although there was any number of opportunities to get off this ball. And if he couldn’t come up with something soon, he was going to book passage or hire aboard the next one that looked promising. He could pilot or bow and scrape, but he could also kill when it suited him, so he wasn’t too worried about being victimized.
As the Faleen woman moved past him, Deeg told her 2 Circadian Ales, and he winked at her, and nodded to the human sitting next to him. Fat lot of good it would do him, but it made HIM feel better if he thought he might have some attraction to her. Until his drink arrived, he would continue to relax and watch the crowd. As each new face registered he would continue looking elsewhere, so that no one could ‘meet his gaze’ and take offense. You didn’t want to give offense, but in those instances where it happened, it was either someone trying to make a name for themselves, or someone too stupid to realize what he might be getting into. Deeg had that firm belief that if he couldn’t avoid trouble, he could handle it. How had he learned it? “*Strike first, strike hard, finish it.”*
Once the drinks arrived, he nodded again to the human next to him, and then turned away, to scan another part of the Cantina. Hmm… that could be interesting.

I guess I should have been a bit more selective in hitching a ride outta there. I’m not even sure where there was…somewhere in the Outer Rim. It’s not my fault. My Duros shipmates did the flying. I did the taking. I like relatively lawless worlds where the Strong can take and the weak can envy Strength. We had re-purposed quite a few things in our travels. Unfortunately, whatever share I had coming to me is likely somewhere far away from here.
 *Nal Hutta*. I remove my filter mask for a moment. Acrid, fetid air with a sulfurous tinge to it irritates my nostrils. I put my filter mask back on. Not my favorite place in the galaxy but beggars can’t be choosers. I have exactly no creds. I’m hungry but not about to bust into my ration packs just yet. That place over there, *the Lizard’s Breath*, seems busy. Lots of traffic, in and out. Might be a good place to look for some work…
As I opened the front door of the cantina, I was buffeted by the warm miasma of familiar smells: smoke, spice, food and body odor. However, inside my re-purposed Ubese armor, I smelled nothing. Likely no great loss; I've been to hundreds of similar places. Not a one has smelled particularly good to me.
Some Klatooinian bouncer-type gave me a hard look as I walked in. He pointed at my unsheathed vibro ax in my right hand and said “Keep it civil.” Whatever. But perhaps I should really think about getting a holster of some sort made for my ax…
A decent-looking Twi’lek serving girl asks me what I want to drink. I tell her I’ll get back to her in a few. Hmmm…I look around a bit. It’s the usual rogue’s gallery of galactic detritus. There should be an easy mark around here somewhere. “Ahhh! There! That guy will do nicely,” I think to myself. Some Aqualish sitting alone at the bar must have apparently made some inappropriate comment to that Falleen serving girl. He looks *kiffed* out. A perfect target for my little “Protection racket.” Once he hears about the people looking for him, he’ll need my protection and my services don’t come cheaply!.
Yes, I know. Using my Blessings of Ak’Kra’Far to trick people into paying me for my services might seem wasteful but, I assure you, it’s perfectly acceptable. In fact, Ak’Kra’Far wouldn’t have directed me to such a weak-willed *kiffer* if He hadn’t wanted me to use the Aqualish’s personal resources for my own advantage.
It is Ak’Kra’Far’s Will; I am but his humble tool.
I head over to the Aqualish to inform him of the dangerous bounty hunters looking for him…

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-06 17:10:02)

The human sitting next to Deeg smiles and mumbles something impossible to make out - apparently the beer Deeg had offered was not his first for the night - before taking half of it down in a single swipe. A moment of silence is observed, followed by a loud burp and a slightly unstable attempt to get up from the table. After gathering his bearings for another moment, the man finally gets to his feet and offers Deeg another smile before finishing the beer and staggering away in the direction of...well, probably not what he was aiming for, but a random direction anyway.
===============================================================================
As Kurrsk makes his way through the locale he catches some eyes here and there, most likely through a combination of his size, the fact that he is wearing full body armor, and that he is carrying around a massive vibroweapon. Yet, he wasn´t attracting as much attention as one might think. After all, every other person in the establishment probably was carrying a weapon, either openly or concealed. The Aqualish he was heading for looked like he had taken in at least a few glasses in the evening and was flirting wildly with the serving girls, apparently not paying much attention to other things around him.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-06 18:36:30)

Kurrsk walks up to the Aqualish and says “Alright, Buddy, just stay calm and follow my lead and maybe we make it out of here alive. You’ve got 4 or 5 bounty Hunters gunning for you. Maybe if they think you’ve hired my services they’ll be too afraid to make a move on you.”
“By the way, I’m Kurr..uh,…Kurrn, freelance mercenary and bodyguard. I’m sure you’ve heard of me.” “Tsst. Don’t look around. We don’t want them to know we know, right? That’s the key -- turn their trap into our advantage, right?”
“And, before I get shot protecting you from a bunch of crazed, violent bounty hunters, there’s the small matter of my fee… I normally charge 1000 creds a day but I can see you’re in a tough spot…I can drop it down to 500 creds a day but I’d need a 3 day minimum, ok?” ***“Hiring me for a week probably makes the most sense.”***

Deeg thought it was a bit amusing that the guy he chose to sit by was already too inebriated to be out in public. And yet the buffoon swigged the drink like he'd been swimming in a sand dune for the last two weeks. Well, sooner or later someone who wasn't drinking would pick him out as an easy mark and relieve him of .. what? his live? probably. Anyway, looking around, Deeg settles his attention on the big guy who just approached the little fish face. Who knows what that's about. Too far to hear, but the little guy suddenly has fear in is set, and he's furtively looking around. Help or danger? Only two reasons to look around like that with a big guy in your face.
Continuing to scan the bar, Deeg makes note of who else is paying attention to the big guy and the fish face. *I wonder if this is going to have more get involved?* 
Deeg makes sure there's no one paying undo attention to himself, and he continues to nurse his drink.

Vallat had become accustomed to a life of an observer. And to be an efficient observer, he must remain undetected. As such, with his cloak tightly wrapped around his armor, he entered the Lizard’s Breath cantina along with the throng of various species.
Assuming the form of a human seems most logical since they are considered a common species almost everywhere. In fact, through the numerous years he had been assuming his current human form, he has somehow become comfortable with it.
Positioning himself near the door of the establishment to give him a perfect vantage point of the area and a quick exit should something awry transpire, he eased his weight upon a cantina chair. Thinking that the mudcreeper drink might be a cue word required by whoever sent the mysterious transmission, he ordered a mug from the female Falleen.
Surreptitiously, he scanned the area for the possible contact. In the process, he didn’t miss the big armored guy who seems to be harassing an intoxicated Aqualish.
*“Hmmm…. things might get ugly. I certainly hope not.”*, he thought to himself.
Instinctively, Vallat reached out and looked into the White Current , where the streams of fate may lead.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-08 06:36:25)

The Aqualish takes a moment to focus on Kurrsk and blinks twice - first once with only his upper set of eyes, and then using both - and one did not need the power of the Force to sense the confusion in his mind.
**"Wha…uhm, what are you…what?"**
It takes a moment for his senses to register the sheer volume of information the big Trandoshan threw at him at once, but once he had processed it his face changed into a more concerned expression, and he began to get up from his seat.
**"I have no idea why any bounty hunters would be after me, but hiring you for a week makes much sense"**
===============================================================================================
Watching from a distance, Deeg notices some of the nearby patrons laugh a bit at the gullibility of the confused Aqualish, but making no action to interfere. He doe notice, however, another party that seems interested, this one making more of an impression. A tall insectoid - a Blood Carver - was sitting at the other end of the bar, and observed the interaction with an indifferent face. He was dressed sparsely in simple, light clothing and the thing that drew the most attention to him was a pair of ornate hilts extending slightly above his shoulders.
===============================================================================================
As the Faleen waitress moved off with his order, Vallat looked around inside the cantina taking note of the Aqualish being harassed near the bar. Just like Deeg, he also notices the Blood Carver sitting a distance away, looking at the scene.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-08 16:22:17)

Thinking to himself, as he sipped his drink, Deeg watches what's unfolding with some interest. *I wonder what's just transpired between fish face and the big guy, suddenly the fear I saw has been replaced with something more like relief. Seems whatever it is, most of the patrons around it are amused. But that other bug guy is taking more than an amused interest.* 
Deeg looks at the Blood Carver, watching to see if he's going to do more than watch and be amused. *The fish face has is own issue, and the big guy shouldn't have to deal with bug guy interfering. I wonder how much a fiasco this is going to turn into. But bug guy has those two handles above his back, probably blades of some kind. And THAT would be why I prefer blasters. Kiff that getting into melee scuffles.* 
That last thought made Deeg smile. He hoped that to everyone elses perception he was just enjoying the fish face show like everyone else.
But slowly lowering his hand, he checks to see the Blaster Pistol was seated easily in his holster. *Never know when you'll need a friend.*

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-09 03:26:04)

As Vallat waited for his order, he sighed in relief when he noticed that the Aqualish didn't exhibit any sort of aggressive behavior. The crowd seemed in a good mood too, as evidenced by their laughter at the foolhardiness of the Aqualish.
However, his attention was drawn by the Blood Carver who was also intently watching the "show". The pair of hilts jutting out behind its back which could most likely be a weapon, was a new source of concern for the Clawdite.
As always, he kept his eyes peeled for any hint of trouble.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-09 14:20:17)

"A week it is. Good choice, Buddy." " Ok, we should probably go get a table, order some food and take stock of our situation." "Now that I'm your bodyguard, those crazed, violent bounty hunters should keep their distance." " I just need to collect my three-day advance if you please."
Kurrsk and the Aqualish move toward a table in the rear of the cantina. As they're walking there, Kurrsk in front looking menacing with his large vibro ax, the same attractive Twi'lek waitress notices them and asks if he'd like that drink now. "Sure, 2 mud creepers, please. And we're gonna need a couple of menus too. Thanx Baby. "

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-10 07:04:56)

**"They are waiting for you in the back room, sir. Farthest one on the left"**
The Faleen girl smiles at Vallat as she points towards the entrance just over at the end of the bar leading into a different section of the establishment.
=========================================================================
As Kurrsk takes the point in front of the confused Aqualish, the patrons moves out of the way of the large reptilian, and the pair makes their way to an empty table. As he gives the waitress their order though, they are interrupted by the sudden appearance of another reptilian - this one with a stern expression on his face.
**"Keela, would you be kind enough to sssee our amphibian friend out? He will have no need of a bodyguard for the forssseeable future…and thisss one will be unavailable anywaysss…"**
Leaving the Twi'lek to take care of the Aqualish, the creature - a Blood Carver, Kurrsk seem to recall them being called - jerks his head towards the bar.
**"Move your ssscalesss lizard…you are expected in the back roomsss"**
=========================================================================
Observing the scene from his seat, Deeg notices the Blood Carver get up from his seat, but at the same time he is interrupted by a young Evocii boy.
**"Excuse me sir, do you want anything else?"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-10 12:30:38)

**"Ah..Yes! Of course they they are."** Vallat said as he returns a smile at the Falleen.
**"Thank you!"**, he added, as he bowed slightly while he rose up from his seat.
With that, he meandered towards the back room entrance, wary and on the lookout for trouble or unexpected "tests".
So far he was right with the mudcreeper. *"I hope whoever sent those transmissions already did their research on me. I'd really hate to be put on some sort of audition!"*, he mused.

Kurrsk looks a bit miffed. "I tricked that *kiffer*, fair and square," he thought to himself. "Oh well, I'll check out what's in the back room over there, maybe at least they'll buy me some food and drinks. Then again, maybe they will just make me a worse offer than the week of paid work I just lost. Then I can demonstrate what a Chosen of Ak'Kra'Far really excels at: chopping off body parts of people too stupid not to piss me off!"
Kurrsk silently nods at the Blood Carver and heads toward the back room. Thinking to himself, "Blood Carver? Yeah, I'll show *you* some blood carving!"

*Figures, always some distraction when things are getting good.*  Looking at the boy for a moment, Deeq finally answers the boy after taking his eyes off what's been going on, **No boy, nothing else right now. Perhaps in a few minutes you can send the Twilek girl back over.** 
Watching the boy's reaction to his 'rejection', Deeg wonders if the interruption was intentional. If the boy turns to leave, Deeg will again focus on fish face and bug man, somehow figuring those two are linked in this.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-11 07:57:05)

The boy lingered for a moment, before clearing his throat, and looking a bit nervous.
**"Uhm, I think the boss might prefer if you ordered something…sir"**
======================================================================
As he heads towards the back rooms, Vallat spots the Blood Carver he had noticed earlier apparently directing the large Trandoshan in his general direction. It didn´t have to have anything to do with him though, it could just be that the owner of the establishment wanted to have a chat about harassing the clientele.
He enters the doorway and finds a short corridor extending in two directions, with a pair of doorways on either side of the entrance. Most were open and he could hear the sounds of laughter, gambling and other typical sounds of the cantina scene. The door on the farthest left though - the one he had been directed to - was closed.
======================================================================
The Blood Carver looks at Kurrsk as the Trandoshan heads off, unphased by the larger beings stature.
**"Lassst door on the left"**
Apparently thinking he had instructed Kurrsk enough, the smaller reptilian turned his attention elsewhere in the cantina.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-11 12:44:06)

Kurrsk wades through the throng heading towards the room in the back. He approaches the last door on the left, confidently opens the door and loudly exclaims: "Honey, I'm home!"
Kurrsk looks around in the room.

Vallat can't help but grin at the thought of the huge armored guy's antics. When he saw the Blood Carver directing him towards his direction, the Clawdite decided to let him go first.
Stepping sideways, he let the armored figure who seemed to not notice him at all, go past him.
He observed how confident the vibro-ax wielding behemoth barged through the door.
In the back of his mind, however, Vallat thought it would have been more appropriate if he knocked first.

Deeq watches with interest as the big guy is separated from fish face, and then 'sent' (?) to the back room, along with another big guy.
*And where's that bug guy going? Hmmm… something more going on here.*
Noticing the young boy is still there and has said something, he replies, **Yes well by all means then bring me one of them "mudcreepers" I've heard about.**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-12 11:14:04)

**"Yes sir, right this way sir"**
A small feeling of the relief can be seen washing over the young Evocii´s face, and he starts to move towards the entrance to the back rooms, waiting for Deeg to follow.
=====================================================
As the door slides up into the doorway in front of Kurrsk, the room that is revealed behind it is sparsely furnished, and clearly meant to serve as a meeting room of sorts. A round table with a holoprojector in its middle dominates the room, a few panels in the ceiling provides lightning, and six chairs surrounds the table, two of which are occupied.
On one of the chairs sits a middle-aged human, dressed in classy clothing, and with an aura of confidence around him. His face and appearance displays signs of age, but more so of experience, as he casually observes the large Trandoshan barging into the room. Sitting next to him was a small, rodent-like creature with light green fur with a few darker patches, complete with a pair of pointy longer ears. This one was dressed more like the usual patronage one would expect to find in a cantina - tunic, trousers, and a scarf around his neck, all in darker, more earthly colors.
It appeared that they had been having a conversation, which had been interrupted by the Trandoshan barging inside. They didn´t seem to take the interruption that hard though, as the human kept talking after only a brief moment of silence.
**"…as I was saying, I think they will be able to handle the situation. And we simply didn´t have any people to spare anyway"**
The smaller being didn´t appear too assured by whatever they had been discussing.
**"Sure, sure, whatever you say. Still, I´m glad you didn´t pick them because of their intelligence. Observations did report at least one may be suffering from some mental disorder"**
The human laughs a little and turns back towards the door and the Trandoshan. The Blood Carver passes Vallat in the corridor outside, giving him a slight push to urge him inside before he moves into the room, nodding towards the human, who responded in kind before speaking up.
**"Ah, gentlemen, come in, come in and have a seat. I am sure you are all wondering why you are here. We are just waiting for another attendant for this little meeting, and then we can get down to business"**

> A small feeling of the relief can be seen washing over the young Evocii´s face, and he starts to move towards the entrance to the back rooms, waiting for Deeg to follow.

Rising slowly, Deeg watches the reaction in the boy that his mention of mudcreeper had. Clearly, he wasn't getting another drink, and as the boy led him toward the back, he wondered if the big guy and the bug guy were going to be part of this too. A barely perceptible smile crosses his face as he thinks *I thought this night would be interesting. Here we go!*

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-12 21:33:07)

Kurrsk looks around the room and says "No buffet? I thought this was going to be a catered event!"
Although he's still wearing a filter mask and voice modulator, Kurrsk smiles at the older human and his trained Bog-rat. Kurrsk thinks to himself "I didn't know you could teach Bog-rats to talk! Back on Trandosha, we would just eat them...."
Mmmmm... Kurrsk reminisces about earlier days with a freshly-caught Bog-rat, wrapped in *sikka* leaves and left to smoke. The spicy flavor of the *sikka* leaves would infuse that yummy Bog-rat meat with its flavor! We could never seem to get enough of it!
Kurrsk looks a little over-interested in the older human's tasty-looking talking Bog-rat...

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-13 06:06:27)

Vallat enters the room and nods an acknowledgement to the human and rodent like sentient in the room.
He slowly seats himself in one of the vacant chairs and decided to wait for the other attendant.
He found no point in having to introduce himself again to the new comer. He'd also save their host the same inconvenience.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-13 09:47:17)

The small creature looks at Kurrsk with not even the slightest attempt to hide his contempt, then over at the human next to him, and then back at Kurrsk. Finally after a few moments he looked back at the elderly human.
**"Really, Bogda? I know the operation is simple, but it does require a functioning brain. Can´t we just give them a mouse droid instead?"**
The old man - apparently named Bogda - laughed heartily as a young Evocii boy entered the room, followed by Deeg. The young alien native was handed something by the Blood Carver and ran off, shortly followed by the reptilian with the door closing behind them. Bogda looked over at Deeg, and waved his hand towards one of the still empty chairs.
**"Ah, and our last attendee has arrived. I was beginning to think you weren´t interested. Would have been a shame if we´d had to liquidate you"**
As apparently everyone was present who had been expected, Bogda cleared his throat.
**"Well , then, as everyone is finally assembled, let´s get down to business shall we?"**
On cue, the holoprojector in the middle of the table flickered to life, displaying the image of a tall young human with long black hair, a rather wiry appearance, and some sort of tribal tatoo covering the upper left half of his face.
**"Behold Kit Jargen, the youngest son of a wealthy merchant and brilliant student of the medical institute of Coruscant. However, young master Jargen decided to place his talents and chemical engineering at the disposal of the underworld rather than stay on a legitimate path. More specifically, he have been responsible for the creation of over a dozen new and refined variants of spice which have been exploding across the black markets in the last year. This however, is not why we have taken an interest in him.
About a week ago, young Jargen fell into disfavor with some of his collaborators, forcing him to seek protection here on Hutta with the Cartel. The Cartel however, saw this as an opportunity to improved their with the new order in the Galaxy, and have offered to hand him over in exchange for the Empire´s favor. Now, my associates and me have discovered that while the Empire does claim to want to lock a most dangerous criminal up, they are in secrecy planning to enlist him in the creation of chemical and toxicological weaponry. This, we cannot allow, and this is where you come into the picture.
Any questions so far?"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-13 12:05:06)

*Ah! Foregoing niceties? These guys are definitely in a rush.*, Vallat thought to himself.
It seems it was correct for him to assume that their hosts did research on them.
Nonetheless, his curiosity was piqued.
Leaning forward, an arm resting on the table, Vallat queried. **"What do you want us to do and why would we want to do it?"**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-13 13:47:45)

As Deeg enters the room, he does a quick survey to see who is there, where they are, and how they're armed. He subconsciously ranks the threats from highest to lowest, and files it away for future reference if needed.
To the comment about being liquidated, he responds with a monotone,
**Yes, that would have been an unfortunate result, premature to the need, and costly.** 
He takes the seat he's offered, and listens to Bogda's discourse on the young engineer. When Vallat cut to the point, Deeg watched for the subtle or not so subtle reactions to the question, and paid closer attention to what Bogda said next, how he answered the interruption.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-13 16:52:16)

Kursk smiles, amused that a guy named "Bogda" would have a talking Bog-rat! Maybe if we do a good job getting this spice cook, maybe we can all have a celebratory feast together! Can I get *sikka* leaves in Hutt Space?
Once again lost in food reverie, Kurrsk answers the question posed by the old human: "So, we bust into a cartel facility, simple smash and grab and if we can't get the spice cook out with us we silence him permanently, right?"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-13 18:34:50)

Bogda seems about to respond to Vallat as Kurrsk suddenly opens his mouth. When the Trandoshan finishes, the older man gives a slight nod, tilting his head a little.
**"More or less, though we´d much prefer if he is taken alive. Though even as our observations have reported a certain talent for destruction, I´d advise against trying to breach a Cartel stronghold. You see, we are under a bit of time pressure here. Jargen is behind handed over to the authorities at midday tomorrow, so there´s not a whole lot of time to plan.
As for the matter of incentive, there will be a substantial reward for each of you on the successful completion of the operation"**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-13 18:54:03)

Deeg asks, **And with all your resources and personnel, you think this three can accomplish it? Sounds more like you're aiming for plausable denyabilty, whether or not it succeeds.** 
Deeg leaves unsaid what the next logical step after the operation would be, whether or not it succeeds.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-13 20:17:11)

"Do we have any idea about the Imperial pick-up crew? Are they known to the Cartel people? Can we steal an Imp shuttle and move up the timeline of the exchange?"
Pointing to Deeg, "I bet thus Duros guy here can fly a mean shuttle." Pointing to Vallat, "Maybe this human could impersonate an Imperial officer. And assuming we can scrounge me up some Stormtrooper armor, I could probably pass for a 'next generation' Stormtrooper."
"Oh, and just how 'substantial' will the reward be?" "I'm assuming we get more creds if we get the Cook back alive?"

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-14 03:21:24)

Bogda laughs at Deeg, and offers his fellow human a smile.
**"Perhaps we do. Though our own local resources are a bit tied up at the moment, and yes, we wish to avoid attracting any attention, should the operation fail. It will also be a simpler task to avoid both the Imperial and Cartel radars for a small group of freelancers"**
The older man turns his head to the Trandoshan.
**"I am not intimately familiar with Imperial procedures in these cases, but I would assume a prisoner transport includes an armed detail. It seems important for Palpatine to show off the military might of his Empire wherever it goes. As for how you go about resolving the operation itself, I prefer to not be too involved in the details. I might be able to assist in terms of local knowledge and limited equipment, but the operation itself should remain as standalone as possible.
As for you compensation, it will be substantial as mentioned, seeing as - as you have already noticed - there is certain risk and limited support involved. Upon completion of the operation, you wil each be rewarded with a sum of 25.000 credits. I hope that can be seen as sufficient compensation"**

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-14 05:11:24)

" So we're clear, 25k apiece if we succeed in preventing the transfer. Shall we say, 40k apiece if we bring the Cook back alive? Surely, his father, the wealthy merchant, would throw you an extra 45k to get his boy genius back, right?"

Deeg remains largely silent as the others negotiate the details of the contract. They were saying what he agreed with, so it would be counterproductive for him to add his voice. He looked from one to another, depending on who was speaking, and nodded at the appropriate times to show solidarity with the two.
He'd imperceptibly cracked a smile of pride when it was noted that he was a good pilot, although he didn't know how they could know that. But it might just have been their assumption considering it was common knowledge that Duros made the best pilots.
Watching and listening, that was his role in this conversation, as long as it went in the direction he'd want it to go. A Duros, a human and a Trandoshan, an interesting team. But he'd worked with many Hutt hires, so it was all ok as long as they held up their end of the mission. And listening to them negotiate here, he felt they knew what they were doing.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-14 15:02:33)

Though he has much apprehensions in having any dealings for or against the Empire, Vallat nonetheless, considered the mission.
He understands that Kit Jargen is a threat to society at large and a greater threat in the hands of the Empire, the thought of killing him still doesn't do well with his moral compass.
**"If we do succeed in bringing him in alive, may we know what you intend to do with him?"**, the Clawdite questioned Bogdan.
Vallat wasn't really keen on the material rewards of the mission. He was however hoping that he was somehow working for the good guys.The human's answer might give him a hint as to the organization's nature. Of course, Bogdan could lie. Hopefully, he would discern if that would be the case.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-14 17:31:29)

Before Bodga could reply to Kurrsk´s attempt at haggling, the green-furred creature next to him nods repeatedly and speaks up. Halfway through his sentence his voice changes into an openly mocking tone instead
**"Yes, yes, I hear you. Or - and this is just a suggestion - you could put whatever grey matter is rumbling around inside that mask of yours to use on trying to figure out a way to fix this and save the negotiations for later. Because, you know, the amount you get paid if you botch this thing up will be the same no matter what you say"**
Waving his hand to calm his associate, Bodga listens to Vallat´s question before speaking up again.
**"There will be no getting his boy back for the dear father. One way or the other, young Jargen will face justice, though whether it is the mock justice of the Empire or real justice by someone else's hand is rather dependent on your actions. Have no illusions, the boy is a criminal and a potential sanctified war criminal to be. I think we can all agree that something has to be done, right?"**

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-14 21:40:30)

Kurrsk considers the older human's words for a moment and says "I try not to judge others too much. I prefer to allow myself a certain 'latitude of the moment.'" "Maybe something does need to be done with this guy, probably by folks trying to protect their existing spice market." "Fortunately, that latitude I spoke of earlier allows me a certain moral freedom to associate with lots of people for many reasons (as long as those reasons involve credits!)."
"Back to our earlier topic though, yes I understand the price of failure but let us also recognize the various types of success available to us: 1) we eliminate the Cook; 2) we obtain the Cook and bring him back to you for justice; 3) any combination of the other 2 options and we reduce the number of either Cartel or Imps in the area."
"Some results, particularly the one where the Cook is brought back for YOU to administer YOUR justice probably has a greater value than just eliminating the guy, right?"
"I would imagine that a more preferable result probably is commensurate with a more preferable reward, right?"
"Let's celebrate our agreement to a 15k bonus each (so 40k in total each) if we succeed in bringing the Cook back to you for you to administer justice to this war criminal."
"Let's drink and feast to these new contract terms, ok?" "In any event, can we get a beverage in here?"

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-15 13:28:52)

While everyone's attention is directed at Krussk, Vallat furtively scans the area for details that may help him identify the organization where his would be employer belong.
He expects that they will be kept in the dark on that aspect.
When addressed by the Bogdan, **"Yes. I understand the need to mete out punishment for all the transgressions he has done. However, if there is a possibility to reform him so that he may be a useful part of the society again, perhaps he could be granted that chance."**, he replied, his tone more of expressing rather than arguing.
**"Nonetheless, it is too early to discuss it now as his fate is still uncertain. For now, I'll find relief with the prospect of barring him to do more harm."**
Addressing everyone in the room, **"Now that we are all in agreement with the terms of this employ, perhaps it's time to introduce ourselves to one another. Although we already know Master Bogdan's here,"** he gestured to the human, **"However, it would be quite queer if I simply address you as Duros.."**, Vallat looking towards Deeg, **"or address you as big guy in Ubese armor."**, he joshed while his gaze now upon the armored figure.
**"I'm Vallat, and infiltration is my specialty."**, the Clawdite declared with a slight bow.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-15 15:39:10)

**I"m called Deeg. Duros, as you can see, and I'm somewhat adept at piloting, as well as hitting what I shoot at.**
Looking at them as he speaks, Deeg tries to size up his employers. Clearly the intro was for the others in the team, these guys didn't look like they'd invite to this meeting someone they didn't already know the identity of, or something about.

Kurrsk nods to Deeg and Vallat.

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-15 22:34:12)

Deeg nods back, and comments, **A good pilot always has someone covering his six.**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-16 04:24:45)

Bodga smiles as the introductions are being made, a smile you are starting to guess is characteristic for him.
**"Well then, if there was nothing else, I suppose I should leave you to your work, as I´m sure you have lots to do"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-17 03:18:00)

Vallat smiled back at Bogda.
Before the human can turn his back on the group., the Clawdite raised a finger and stated, **"Before we can proceed, we will need the details of the mission."
"Do we have info on where Jargen is kept? Do they have security systems installed there? How about expected resistance?"
"Further, you did mention about being able to provide limited equipment. By chance, are a few remote grenades and gas grenades categorized as 'limited equipment'?"**, the shape-changer asked a bit sheepishly.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-17 05:00:45)

**"He is kept inside a Cartel stronghold, and unfortunately my agents have been unable to deduce which of the local slugs are keeping him. But of course there will be security systems in place, Hutts are paranoid, always thinking everyone wants what´s theirs. I really couldn´t tell what kind of resistance could be expected in those places, but they tend to be overloaded with people carrying guns, both hired security and people just enjoying the hospitality. I think that´s part of a Hutt strategy, keep the mob in good spirits and they will act as cannon fodder should anyone attack your stronghold.
As I mentioned, I believe you will have greater luck trying to snatch him during the exchange itself, rather than trying to breach an Hutt fortress, but I leave the details up to you. As for equipment, there are still regulations on weaponry and munitions, even in Hutt space these days. A friend of mine work at the space port though, tall, bulky fellow by the name of Gert, and he can usually get you what you need"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-17 05:32:16)

**"Thank you very much information! Indeed, it might be suicidal to assault a Hutt stronghold.
"Do you have info on where the exchange would occur?"
"Otherwise, with no idea where Jargen will be coming from, it seems our only option is to wait for them in the docks."**

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-17 06:17:32)

Kurrsk asks "Docks? Is that where the exchange is taking place?" " I must have missed that." "Do we know what specific Hutt or Hutts we're gonna be pissing off once we grab this guy?"
As to Gert, are we working off a free tab of, say, up to 10,000 creds worth of gear? Because I'm a little low on creds right now...

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-17 08:11:13)

**"We know he is here in the vicinity of Bilbousa, that´s why we called the meeting here. But as I said, we don´t know at what local Hutt palace he is being held. Though I´m sure it wouldn´t take too much skill and effort to find out where an Imperial shuttle is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. Just in case you would like to actually try and formulate a plan, and not just assault an Imperial escort outright"**
Turning his attention to Kurrsk, Bogda reaches out a hand to silence his furry companion without even looking at him, and the little creature bites down on something he was about to say.
**"I am guessing that what your friend is referring to is the fact that he Imperials is with relatively high probability going to take their prisoner off planet. And to do so they would require a ship, and they will probably be arriving in one. And just as most people do, especially when coming on official business, they will most likely land it in the spaceport. Hence, it can be safe to assume that by being in the docks, you are likely to come into the vicinity of the Imperials and their prisoner.
As unusual as it sounds, the Cartel is doing this deal with a unified front. Most likely because no one wants to stand outside any possible Imperial favor, and possibly to show some strength in Palpatine´s face as well. However, if you were to bust up part of a local stronghold, you will likely incur slightly more disfavor with that particular Hutt than the rest of them"**
At the Trandoshan´s last question, he throws a quick glance at his associate again, making a gesture for him to get up.
**"Just talk to Gert and I´m sure you can work something out…"**

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-17 14:06:45)

Kurrsk says to his new compatriots: " So, let's go see Gert and see what sort of gear he can score us." "Also, since my earlier attempts at subtlety were ignored, can we stop and get something to eat and maybe a drink or two either before we leave this joint or on the way?"

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-17 15:50:18)

Deeg nods, **Gert sounds like a good idea, as does a meal. Who knows if we'll get another anytime soon.** 
The Duros walks along behind his new compatriots, and wonders, *Pistols are ok, but I may need something longer range, or with more area effect. I wonder if he can get a deck sweeper? Or at least a sniper rifle? Hmmm… so many options, but won't know til we talk to Gert. I wonder what his chink is?*
Deeg walks along with the others but clearly is thinking about something.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-21 10:45:44)

Vallat was about to rise up from his seat to follow the others when it occurred to him that their newly formed ragtag crew needs access to computers to do the initial search for the information they seek.
Addressing their human employer, **“Uhm….We need computers to sift through the HoloNet for the required info. If you have computers here, we could start working right away.”**, his voice full of enthusiasm.
“**Oh! If it wouldn’t be too much to ask, can we have some food especially for our famished armored friend over there? After all, it’s quite hard to work on an empty stomach.”** Vallat added smiling, trying his best not to sound pushy while gesturing to the hulking Trandoshan.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-22 03:55:22)

As he and his associate stands up from their chairs, Bogda looks first at Vallat, and then over at Kurrsk.
**"A bite to eat should not be too hard to find given that we are standing in a cantina. Give the barkeep my greetings"**
Adjusting the collar of his jacket, the human nodded towards his smaller companion who was already halfway out the room, and his voice changed into a slightly more stern tone.
**"My friend here has already - though perhaps unnecessary bluntly - highlighted a certain lack of tact and intelligence, though I have been unwilling to fully side with him on this. Don´t make me change my mind. I thought it had been made clear that a certain detattchment would exist in this mission and that my organization is employing freelancers to maintain a certain degree of anonymity. You will be contacted again once the operation is over, regardless of it´s outcome. Enjoy the meal"**
With those words the elderly human followed his furry partner out of the room, leaving the rest of you alone inside.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-22 05:05:22)

Kurrsk smiles to himself and thinks "Maybe after we get done with this mission and collect our reward, I'll carve that old man some new manners! That is, after I make him watch me cook and eat his pet Bog-rat."
Kurrsk pops his head outside the door and flags over that sexy Falleen server. " A couple rounds of drinks for my friends and me, please. And, can you bring some assorted foodstuffs too? We're kinda famished so if you hurry, my buddy here (pointing to Deeg) will give you a real nice tip."
Kurrsk re-enters the room. To his new compatriots Kurrsk states "Ok, so besides killing people, I'm good at chopping people's limbs off. I've got a little mechanical aptitude. I can be persuasive in a pinch (lifting his ax a little). I'm not any good at slicing but if you find me someone who is, I might be able to persuade them to help us."
"If one of you is decent at slicing, maybe you can get on the Holonet from here and see if we can find out a few things." "Then, let's get over to that Gert guy ans see what sort of gear he has for us."
"Oh," reaching into his utility belt and retrieving his comlink, "let's all set our comms to the same frequency."

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-22 13:10:10)

Deeg nods at the server when she's told he would be producing the tip.
Then, after they're alone, Deeg produces his own commlink and adjusts the setting to match what Kurrsk has suggested.
**Well if we're all going to brag about our abilities, I guess I'll go next. As has been mentioned, I'm a pilot. But I'm also a bit of a mechanic too. I like to be unobtrusive at times,**  He looks at Kurrsk and smiles, then continunes,  **And, I am that slicer you're referring to, in a way. But also I consider myself a shooter.**  He moves some loose clothing aside and you see Deeg has a holster on each hip, with a slightly different blaster in each holster.

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-26 11:36:14)

Vallat stared at Bogdan as he spat his snide comments.
The moment the human and sentient rodent left the room, he stood up from his seat. Still leaning on the table, **“I guess we didn’t leave a positive impression, didn’t we?”**, he asked Deeg and Kurrsk.
**“Oh well!”** he sighed while he shrugged his shoulder before anyone could answer.
**“We’ll just have to do well in the mission to redeem ourselves.”**
In compliance, Vallat keys in the group's commlink frequency into his Visual Wrist Comm.
**“Let’s eat, then find ourselves a terminal so we can start working.”** , he said, gesturing towards the door, signalling his new found companions to go ahead.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-07-30 11:15:59)

The cantina staff soon returns with a beverage and food for the three newly acquainted companions. As can be expected in the kind of establishment they are visiting, the food won´t exactly win any kind of culinary prices, but it offers nothing to complain about. The drinks follows the same standard - nothing too fancy, but more than enough for the usual clientele. Once they are done, they pack up their gear and leaves the *Lizard´s Breath* behind, aiming for the local spaceport. As they move outside, the evening has begun to settle in, or at least it seems that way. Though on Hutta everything is always bathed in a damp gloom from the sunlight being filtered through the various chemicals in its atmosphere.
Arriving at the spaceport, they find it to be a loose collection of secluded landing strips, some walled off by artificial means, others by natural ones. As they walk inside, they find themselves inside a wide corridor complex, stretching far both to the left and right and ending in angular curves. Along the corridor is lines massive blast doors protecting the entrances to the various landing areas, and it is moderately populated by what seems to be mostly spaceport crew, both biological and mechanical. A number of screens and computer terminals lines the walls with irregular distances between them, displaying advertisements and other informative things. A bit into the corridor to the right they can see a small glassed-in booth occupied by a few humans that appears to be a reception of sorts.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-07-30 18:38:09)

Kurrsk asks his compatriots, "Should we see if these people can point out Gert to us?"
"Also, if we can find an out-of-the-way terminal, maybe we can get to work checking on landing info for Imperial shuttles and other info that might help us locate our Friend."
" Let me know if it's time for me to be 'persuasive'.." (slightly lifting up his vibro ax in the process)

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-07-30 18:58:13)

Deeg has been watching the various people they've come across as they wandered through the spaceport. Seemed to be a mix of low life, workers and wannabees, with a few takers mixing in the crowd. *Just let one try to put the touch on me and we'll see what a spectacle I can make.* 
He kept watching though, and while he wondered what was going on in the glass display case, he didn't think of asking them about Gert until Kurrsk brought it up. **Maybe we should not be seen as a group when one of us asks? No sense in giving anyone any more information about us that is absolutely necessary. So if you want, I'll drop back and cover if one of you want to ask about Gert?**  Waiting for a reply from Kurrsk and Vallat about his suggestion, Deeg takes half a step to the right to put just a little space between himself and the other two.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-07-30 21:36:39)

Although the meal served were mediocre, nonetheless, the Clawdite found it satisfying. The newly found group took the opportunity to know more of each other and discuss their plans on how to proceed with their mission. This is one of the rare times he could actually relax.
Vallat had to admit to himself that he is enjoying his new crew. The Trandoshan's stories may be too far out, still, he found him amusing. The Duros Deeg, he discovered, was a stark contrast to Kurssk. His insights actually makes sense and could be useful.
The moment the group left the safety and privacy of the cantina room, he immediately picked up the slack. Whilst the travel to the spacedocks was uneventful, he maintained a watchful eye.
**"You may have a point."** again, he found himself agreeing with the Duros.
**"Indeed, it may be prudent if we are not seen as a group."**
**"Let me handle the talking this time tho'."**, he discreetly gestured to his companions to stay back as he approached the reception booth.
"**Excuse me."** Vallat addressed a human female in the group.
**"Could you direct me to Gert, tall, bulk guy?"**, he queried while beaming his best smile.
**"I'm an acquaintance of his."**, he added expectantly.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-08-05 17:00:24)

The young human smiles back as Vallat approaches her. She seems to ponder his question for a moment before answering.
**"Yeah, he is part of the maintenance crew working the landing strips. At least I think his name is Gert…a Houk fits your description pretty well though. Anyway, I think they´re out on one of the strips now, fixing some banged up freighter. It´s that way, bay 8"**
She points down the corridor to the left.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-08-05 19:26:15)

Kurrsk: " Cool. Let's head over to Bay 8."

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-06 00:26:29)

Deeg will nod to Kurrsk in agreement, then as he and Vallat walk away, Deeg will hang back.
He's watching for others observing Kurrsk and Vallat, and also just trying to not look like part of the group. He'll also make some pretense of not finding what he's rubbernecking looking for.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-08-06 04:36:18)

Vallat leans forward and smiled at the human female. **"Thanks a lot sweetie!"**, he whispered.
He steps a few paces backwards without averting his gaze from the receptionist and a smile still plastered on his face. **"I'll be on my way."**, he said, his thumb pointing at the general direction of Bay 8.
He turns about and walked towards Bay 8 as instructed.
Vallat purposely didn't meet up with Deeg and Kurrsk to maintain their ploy that they're not together.
Inconspicuously, he hailed the two via his commlink. **"<See you at Bay 8.>"**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-08-09 12:17:27)

As they walk through the corridors of the spaceport heading for Bay 8, the three companions are passed by the same variety of people they´ve observed before. Most don´t really care about the trio but is rather going about their business, though a few casts a second look at Kurrsk. Indeed, the large and armored trandoshan looks slightly out of place in the spaceport, especially carrying his axe around. Deeg and Vallat moves more inconspicuously though, only attracting the rare glance from individuals they pass close to.
Reaching an archway labeled with a crude "8" in huttese, they look inside. The landing strip is a natural one, with a rough grass floor, and its left and back sections walled off by natural rock formations and the right wall being artificial duracrete. Inside the bay is a long, sleek ship with a front section slightly resembling the beak of a predatory bird. The cunning eye would identify it as a Hawk-290 freighter, a relatively fast and maneuverable ship produced by CEC. This one looked like it had seen better days though, with dark patches lining its hull looking like they could be either carbon scoring or some sort of heat or ionization burns from flying to close to some source of radiation.
Scurrying around inside the bay is a ragtag band of mechanics, a few humans, ughnaughts, a sluissi along with a few astromech droids of varying models. Up on one of the ships wings a massive form was crouched over an open hatch, and the trio could hear a series of curses rising in a bellowing bass voice as a shower of sparks erupted from the open hatch. One of the astromechs rolled closer to the wing a let out a series of chirps. A grunt was heard and the massive form made a surprisingly agile leap down to the ground, landing in front of the droid, nearly knocking it over.
**"You do it better then, you little piece of spare bolts"**
Wiping his forehead, the engineer - a Houk, everyone recognized now that they got a better look - turned over towards the entrance to the bay, having apparently noticed the newcomers. Starting to move towards them, he bellowed loudly, replacing a couple of tools in one of the many pockets of his working overalls.
**"You want somethin'? We´re kinda busy here"**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-10 02:05:20)

As one or both of the other two (Kurrsk and Vallat) move to engage who is likely to be Gert, Deeg will look around sorta causally for an available data terminal.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Deeg will also remind Vallat that a terminal with access is still needed via their comms, and he adds
*And a little privacy while we use it won't hurt.*

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-08-10 11:53:01)

Vallat acknowledges Deeg's reminder regarding the data terminal and makes a mental note of it.
**"Sorry to bother you, my friend."**, the Clawdite said as he approached the Houk. **"We understand you're a bit occupied right now but by chance, are you. Gert?"** , Vallat queried.
When he is close enough, **"We were sent by a friend of yours who has quite a liking for mud creepers."**, Vallat whispered then waited expectantly. He doesn't want to mention Bogdan's name outright and hoped that the hulking mechanic would somehow recognize the drink.
"**I believe we have something urgent to discuss."** he added.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-08-10 16:17:52)

Kurrsk sees that Vallat is handling this far better than he would have, Kurrsk just stands there non-chalantly but ready for trouble if trouble should present itself.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-08-12 05:12:04)

**"Aye then little man, speak up, I´ve got work to do"**
The big Houk wiped his hands on his overalls and looked expectantly at Vallat. As Deeg looks around, he finds a computer terminal located on the inside of the entrance to the bay.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-08-12 13:10:33)

**"We are working for your friend and he instructed us to go to you for supplies.",** Vallat replied in a direct yet friendly manner.
**"Also, is there a computer terminal we can access here?"**, he looked around a bit. **"Preferably somewhere with a bit more privacy."**, the Clawdite continued as he reverts his gaze to the imposing figure in front of him.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-12 15:54:23)

Deeg looks from the public terminal back to Vallat and Gert, also watching for anyone else paying attention to their conversation.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-08-12 16:55:33)

Kurrsk watches stoicly.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-08-12 19:08:27)

The Houk erupts in a roaring laugh and looks at Vallat and the others.
**"Ah, yes, I´ve been known to produce the occasional object you don´t find at your local vendor in this stinkin' swamp. What'cha boys need? And if ye need a terminal, just use the one behind ya. Not a lot people here this hour, and me boys are busy fixin' this banged up wreck. Belongs to some hotshot wannabe who flew it too close to an ion cloud tryin' to impress some lass…needn´t tell ya how that went, do I?"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-08-13 09:56:11)

Vallat let out a heartful laughter.
**"No, you don't have to!"**, he replied, his grin still wide on his face.  **"It's a shame tho' that such a splendid ship be messed for such trivial pursuits."**
**"If I were given an opportunity to own such a ship….,"**, his eyes traced the Hawk-290 from fore to aft, **"I'd use it to save the galaxy or something."**
Looking back at the Houk, **"Anyway,"** the Clawdite's assumes a more serious expression, **"I only need a few frag and gas grenades I could use as a distraction. Preferably those with remote detonation option."**
**"My colleagues might require something else."**, Vallat said as he turns his attention to Deeg and Kurrsk.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-08-13 14:31:30)

Kurrsk says "I would like a plasma rifle in 40 watt range." If not, an assault blaster rifle would be great. Any access to some regular Stormtrooper armor? We might need a disguise...

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-13 15:31:23)

Deeg smiles at the 'invitation' for equipment on a wish list. He walks from the Terminal back over to Vallat and Gert, and thinks a moment before he give his 'list': **I've always had a yearn to have my own Decksweeper. But the Imperials are so restrictive you know? They're hard to find except by the someone who really is the best at his business. Any chance you can get one?** 
Watching Gert's reaction to that particular weapon's mention goes a long way toward Deeg's opinion of the procurer's resources.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-08-23 13:03:47)

**"Ain´t that hard to find, as they ain´t lethal. We got a few lyin' around the port, just in case. Reeeal good when someone comes in with a pack o' mynocks on the hull, or some of them pest swarms from the swamps decide to come into the bays. The Hutts ain´t so picky about whether somethin' can kill ya or not though. I´ve got some grenades for ya, both gas and proper ones"**
The massive Houk puts two fingers in his mouth and blows a sharp whistle, getting the attention of some of his workers. He shouts something in a language none of you are familiar with, and two of the ughnaughts scurries away.
**"Not sure how much use gas´ll be for ya though, most beings in this place carries gear to filter the air"**
He shoots Kurrsk a look and eyes the big reptilian from top to toe, and then nodded towards Vallat.
**"Even if I did, it wouldn´t fit. Imps make´em for people like him, not you and me. And any that could be found here is likely to have a few holes in it anyway, it´s not like they are just given away. If ya need some firepower though, I can probably fix ya up"**

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-08-23 18:37:34)

Excellent! An assault blaster rifle and a couple of power packs would do nicely. Thanx Gert.

### **Anodyzed** (2014-08-24 13:27:38)

Having his new weapon request considered, Deeg will return to the data terminal and begin working on getting some 'intel' on their task ahead.

After a few minutes, he calls Kurrsk and Vallat to see what he's uncovered so far.

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-08-27 11:11:59)

**"Well, an explosion that releases irritating smoke surely makes a helluva distraction!",** Vallat replied to the massive mechanic.
**"Anyway, if you could throw in some concussion grenades, I'd really appreciate it."**, the Clawdite added.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-05 20:00:17)

Accessing the public terminal, Deeg does indeed find an interesting arrival scheduled around midday the next day. Something that is even more interesting is the fact that the same ship seems to be scheduled for service a mere 15 minutes after its arrival. Either someone knows their ship is going to be banged up pretty bad, or they are planning to stay only very briefly and wants their ship ready for departure as soon as possible.
While Deeg investigates things over at the terminal, Gert looks between the three new arrivals in his docking bay, obviously pondering what they might be up to. However, it seems it is just natural curiosity on the massive Houks part, as he makes no further inquiries into the subject. Instead, he entertains his visitors with a delightful tale of a drunken brawl a few nights ago in a nearby alley. He swears that if you ever pass by, you can find a dent in one of the duracrete walls shaped like his forehead.
After twenty minutes or so, the two Ughnaughts that scurried away earlier returns, carrying a couple of crates, coming up close to the height of the two workers themselves. The Houk seems to have a much easier time lifting them as he he picks them up and hands them over to the group.
**"There ya go fellas, one slightly used deck sweeper and a pack o' stuff that bursts, flashes and smokes, whatever suits yer fancy. Make sure ya prime the power cell before ye fire baldie, or the thing´ll short circuit on ya"**
He turns to Kurrsk, after motioning for the Ughnaughts to get back to work.
**"Them heavy arms are a little tricker to get around, as even Hutts like to keep some regulation on who keeps the firepower in their space, even though it´s mostly to make sure they have the most of it. But if ye tell me where ye´ll be tomorrow and I´ll have somethin for ya"**

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-09-06 05:22:21)

Kurrsk thanks the Houk for his efforts. "Yeah, I can pop by here early tomorrow if that works for you?"

Deeg shares what he's found with the others. **Looks to me like this is our target. They're planning a quick in and out. So we'll have to be quicker. Anything more we need to check here? I'd like to get that decksweeper checked out. Want to know it will function correctly BEFORE we're in a firefight, ya'know? Any concerns about the rest of the gear we got?** 
Deeg looks from Kurrsk to Vallat waiting for their take on what he'd found.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-09-07 14:40:40)

Vallat just gave Gert a smile when he commented on the inefficiency of the gas grenades.
When Gert handed the gear to the group, he relieves the grenades from Houks's massive hands and fastens them to his utility belt.
**"Thanks a lot Gert! Indeed, our friend at the Lizard's Breath is correct. You're the greatest!"**, Vallat exclaimed his praises on the Houk without sounding patronizing.
**"Oh! If you have access to equipment as well, perhaps you might have a personal translator lying around. I can definitely put it to good use. Any built-in language would do. I believe I could reprogram the language myself."**, he asked sheepishly a bit bashful that he failed to ask all his needed gear in one go.
Looking at what Deeg found in his HoloSearch, **"Nice work!"**, he said, as he gives the Duros a pat on the back.
**"I have a plan."**, he said as he clears his throat. **"We'll hijack the ship!"**
Before his colleagues could react, he continued with his rant, **"We need to know which team is assigned to service the ship. I doubt it would be Gert's team since they're still quite busy with the Hawk-290 there."**, the Clawdite stated while he gestured at the wrecked ship."
**"We can try to impersonate the service team to gain access to the ship. If they're friends of Gert, perhaps we could offer to do their job for them and they still keep their pay. The important thing is we get control of the ship's computer."
"We also need to find the ship's floor and engineering plans. I need those to locate all the air vents. That's where the gas grenades come in. Once the ship's on hyperdrive, I believe those Troopers would be removing their helmets. It definitely doesn't look comfortable. If that won't work, we'll also place grenades in the sleeping quarters. Let's make sure they sleep tight. We also need the plans to find ideal hiding places. We'll be stow-aways!"**, Vallat stated with a grin.
**"Once we have the ship, we can drop out of hyperspace and head back near Nal Huuta or Nar Shadda for the handover. I think it would be hazardous to our well being if we land with the same ship. As an alternative, we could hole up in a backwater planet until we can contact our employers for master Jargen's pick up."
"Lastly, I also need to know who is the commanding officer of the ship is. Preferably, some video or holo footages. I would need it as a back up plan."
"Question? Suggestions? Violent reactions?"**, he asked his companions.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-09-07 16:04:01)

Kurrsk smiles beneath his filter mask. "That's a great plan! We could also look for some cargo containers in which we could each hide. We trigger a warning light in the hyperdrive. Service is called in. The "service chief" tells the Imps that the hyperdrive is weakening. Rather than spend a few days here while the appropriate parts are located, we can install some "hyperdrive range extenders" (three pods in which we're hiding).
Then, the ship leaves on schedule. We poo out while the ship is in hyperspace and whack the inhabitants .
We might need a vac suit for Deeg though since it may be cold."

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-09-07 18:06:16)

Deeg smiles at the thought of aviding getting cold by having a suit to block it. Then, to Vallat, he replies, Ships plans, check. SHip's crew for this assignment, check. Let me get right on it. As for comments, I like it.
Let me get started on those data searches.
Deeg turns his attention back to the data terminal, seems almost gleeful that he has something to do that he's good at.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-10 18:30:40)

The Houk laughs at Vallat as he starts to pull out some tool from the pockets of his overalls.
**"It´s a spaceport, there has to be some translators lying around I guess. I´ll see if I can find one for you"**
With a grunt at his alien companions, Gert moves back to resume working on the freighter behind you, leaving the three of you to your own business.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-09-11 15:29:00)

Other than doing a quick check on the Decksweeper, ammo load and function, Deeg will continue with the searches. As he works his way through the screens, he mentions to Vallat, **We should have gotten a good datapad, so we wouldn't have to stand here like commuters waiting for a shuttle. We could be doing this somewhere even more private.**

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-09-12 01:17:28)

Kurrsk can take a hint and asks Gert "You wouldn't have an extra data pad lying around would ya'?"

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-17 18:49:34)

Hanging in one arm while pondering the origin of a particularly deep carbon scoring, the big Houk only partially pays attention to Kurrsk.
**"Nah, just a few with the specs on this bird. How the blazes does one get scoring on the underside of the wing? Fancy flying, rich boy…"**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-09-21 20:16:38)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-24 15:33:36)

Deeg does his best, but getting access to the blueprints of the shuttle is not easy. After all, it is a highly successful product of a major interstellar corporation, that also happens to be primarily purchased by the government, so security is bound to be pretty tight. With more time and advanced equipment it could certainly be done, but hacking major systems like this is risky business.
He has more success with finding out which service crew is assigned to take care of the shuttle. Apparently the job is assigned to a crew led by a man named Zac, and the crew appears to be all-human - most likely another display of the Empire´s opinion of aliens. The crew appears to have a clean service record though that does in fact mean very little - after all, corruption rules the day in Hutt space, and records like that can easily be changed.
With a few hours having passed, the darkness is descending over Nal Hutta, and Gert and his crew are packing up their stuff to leave for the day, and the big Houk stops by his three new acquaintances by the computer terminal.
**"A'ight boys, time to pack up 'n go home"**

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-09-25 03:16:12)

Kurrsk to his comrades"do you guys think we can whip up some fake ID's for zeb and his crew. Deeg and I may be an issue since neither of us is human. Maybe only Vallat needs an ID and he can smuggle us aboard in a container or something...?"

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-09-25 14:01:54)

Deeg considers his comrade's suggestion. **I could try that, but I don't know that the results would be spectactular. We might well be able to buy one set for Vallat at a better quality than I could make, and him smuggle us in as you say, in a container**
**If you want me to try to produce that document, we'll have to find another place though, it seems our host is booting us for the evening.**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-09-27 16:10:28)

**"Hey Gert! I assume you know Zac and his crew. Do you know where they hang out after work?**", Vallat asked the Houk.
**"The boys and I plan on paying them a visit and perhaps propose an offer they can't refuse."**, he added with a wide grin in his face as he tilts his head towards Deeg and Kurrsk.
**"Oh! Did you find the translator you mentioned a while back? We'd also like to borrow one of your datapads if possible. We promise we won't delete anything. We just need it for more data search. Also, we promise to return it in the morning."**, both hands clasped as the Clawdite pleaded.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-09-28 18:38:52)

**"Just told the lizard I don´t have none to spare. They´re just storage units anyway. I´ll see if I can find a translator for ya 'til the morning"**
He wipes his hands off on his overalls, and rearranges a few of the tools as he waves for the trio to get going.
**"Ain´t got no idea where those numbnuts hang out late, an' don´t know why you´d wanna be lookin' for 'em. Bunch o' arrogant bastards if you ask me"**

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-09-28 21:14:36)

**"Thanks anyway! You've been a great help and we very much appreciate the assistance."** Vallat replied to the mechanic.
**"Arrogant is he? Heh! I don't that Zac fellow will be happy with how things will pan out. Nothing personal, just part of our job from our friend at the Lizard's Breath."**, he said, a smirk forming at the corner of his mouth.
**"Anyway, we'll get going. Thanks again!"**, he said as he waved his hand goodbye to the Houk.
**"Let's go boys!"**, he hollered at Kurssk and Deeg. **"We've got an arrogant bastard to look for!"**
**"Also, if we need to fabricate fake ID's, I am certain I could make one which could be considered "professionally done".**, he added with a grin.

As the trio walks through the corridors of the now near-empty spaceport, the sky showing through some of the transparent roof sections have grown considerably darker, and it would be safe to say that night have fallen over Hutta. Anyone knowing something about the planets reputation would know better than to walk the streets at this hour without watching their backs.

### **Anodyzed** (2014-10-06 23:04:56)

Deeg glances over his shoulder from time to time, but feels suitably confident in his companions "presence."

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-10-07 12:43:33)

**"Alright boys, we've got some leg work to do!"**
He looked at the Trandoshan and jests **"No, I don't mean squats and leg presses."**, a smirk forming in his lips.
**"We have to hunt for Zac and his crew. Perhaps we could ask around near his workplace. If we don't get a lead there, the nearest watering hole would be our next bet."**

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-10-07 13:31:08)

Kurrsk smiles back a sharp-toothed grin "sounds good to me. Of course, it would be a real shame if 3 helpless people walking around all alone here in this scary star port got assaulted." "I hope we don't get jumped by some scary ruffians..."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-10-13 17:30:05)

With the spaceport seemingly shutting down to anything but a minimal skeletal staff this time of the day, it doesn´t take long to find someone to talk to in order to learn that the maintenance crews have left for the day, and that the spaceport don´t keep track of what it´s employees do after hours.
Walking around in an unfamiliar environment looking for someone you´ve never met isn´t exactly easy work, and not much comes for free. Roaming from cantina to bar, the somewhat socially awkward trio lets the charismatic Vallat do most of the talking, to little result. At the third establishment they visit though, as Deeg sits down and casually offers one of the local patrons a drink, the old man says he´d overheard they were looking for Zac, and he tells the Duros that the human and some of his crew can usually be found in a nearby gambling den.
((So, that took you about 2 hours and cost you 500 Cr. Split as you please))

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-10-13 22:59:49)

Going back to Vallat and Kurrsk, Deeg is almost beaming. **I found them. Cost me though. By the way, you each owe me 250 credits, to cover your share of what it cost. Anyway, he's at the nearby gambling den. Or at least, what I've learned, that's the usual place for him and his crew. As much as I hated to pay for that, sometimes its the only way to get the data we needed, in the time frame we're working with.** 
Deeg looks from Vallat to Kurrsk and back, waiting for one of them to say something about his accomplishment.
Finally, he adds, **I know it seems expensive, but… what other choice did we have. Data searching wasn't going to get it for us, and we weren't exactly making good progress in these last couple hours.** 
Deeg seems on the verge of saying more when he's finally interrupted by one of his co-conspirators.
(he talks when he's nervous, or excited, or... )

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-10-15 05:47:38)

**"Hey! Great job!"** Vallat flashed a smile while commending the Duros.
When mention of payment was made, he scratched his head and said, **"Uhm… I only have 150 credits on me."**, clearly ashamed as his face flushed red (through inconspicuous use of his shapechanging ability). **"I hope it would be enough for now. I swear I'll pay the balance when we collect."**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-10-17 22:04:44)

Deeg accepts the 150 credits and turns to look at Kurrsk.

---

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-10-20 21:30:37)

"Yeah, I had a contract with an Aqualish that I need to collect on...or, if you wanna give me a few minutes I'm sure the next guy I see would be happy to donate a few creds to my cause.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-10-23 15:44:04)

Taking a look outside, it is fairly easy to deduce which nearby gambling den the old man had been talking about. Not to mention it seems to be the only one in the immediate vicinity, it also possesses something of the aura that one might think of when hearing the phrase "gambling den".
It doesn´t show with any big flashing signs or lights where it is, and through the fairly wide entrance - looked over by two massive Besalisk bouncers - one can see a dimly lit place, a few card tables, and a general variety of cheering and cursing in assorted languages. Not too long after the trio spots the place, one of the Besalisks moves inside, and in a few moments he returns, hoisting a very upset and furious Chadra-Fan. The small creature chattering too fast to be understood notwithstanding, the bounces makes a swing with two of his four arms and sends the troublesome patron flying to the street.

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-10-23 17:51:42)

Deeg smiles at his companions.
**This looks like what we're searching for.** 
Moving to the little sputtering Chadra-Fan, in common Deeg will ask **So have a trouble in there? Could be I can help you, but you have to calm down enough to tell me of the problem. We may be able to help each other!** 
With that last statement, Deeg winks at Kurrsk and Vallat.

---

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-10-24 11:25:02)

Vallat beams an amicable smile at the Chadra-Fan.
He has no idea what the Duros is up to but he intends to go along.

### **Fax Ardo** (2014-10-25 06:43:49)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-10-25 09:05:52)

The furry little creature twists around a little before getting to his feet and brushing some mud off the simple brown robe he was wearing. Looking a bit disoriented, he turns around when he hears Deeg and looks up at the Duros. Straightening out his clothing a bit, he bursts out in a high-pitched chatter once again.
**"Trouble? Trouble be big folks no know to play cards, that be trouble. Me winning their pants all night, and they accuse me of cheating. Cheating! Just because they can´t count a number higher than their own extremities. So big folks start saying "Teek holding skifter, Teek slinging cards under table", and when Teek protest they pay many-armed grunt to get rid of Teek"**
Noticing the appearance of Vallat and Kurrsk, the Chadra-Fan looks a little concerned.
**"Help? What you need help with?"**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-10-25 13:21:41)

Deeq quietly explains that they're looking for a crew that comes here often. He describes them as best he can from the description he's heard, and asks **You see anyone like that inside?**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-10-26 18:54:37)

The small creature thinks for a moment, and then nods.
**"Big guys playing sabacc at next table. Them laugh when Teek get accused of cheating"**

**We've not been in there before, how many tables do they have? And those guys that threw you out, they're the guards? How many of them are in there? And do they all look the same?**
Deeg works a bit to give everyone in the group a sense of what the interior looks like, and what they could be up against if things go wrong. At the same time he's trying to smooth the feathers, so to speak, of the little guy. Deeg knows instinctively that everyone will talk if given the right audience.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-10-28 20:05:51)

**"Teek see five tables, but Teek thinks there might be more upstairs. Private, you know? And super big guys keep order, a few more inside, just like those guys"**
He points at the two bouncers responsible for kicking him out, which are eying the Chadra-Fan and his newfound associates with little interest.
**"Oh, and one that looks like a…uhm, you know…a cat!"**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-10-29 00:30:21)

Before Vallat or Kurrsk can question Teek, Deeg asks him, **So if we can somehow help you right this wrong they've done to you, what would that be if you could name it?** 
Without waiting for Teek to reply, Deeg looks over to his companions and asks,  **Do you need to know more about what's ahead? If I've missed anything, ask him.**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-11-02 20:53:58)

The little Chadra-Fan looks a bit puzzled at Deeg, perhaps surprised at some show of friendliness in a place like this. Or perhaps he just didn´t understand what Deeg were saying.
**"Uhm, Teek want no trouble, but Teek did win big pile of credits. Maybe you can talk to the other big folks?"**

---

### **Anodyzed** (2014-11-02 22:57:09)

### **KUPALISSSS** (2014-11-08 16:18:10)

**"Easy little guy! No one here wants trouble."** Vallat said in an effort to calm the Chadra-Fan.
**"In fact, I think we should leave before those four armed behemoths become too suspicious."**, he added in a hushed tone, nodding slightly towards the direction of the Besalisks.
**"We can't just barge in there without a plan. We also need to plot an escape route should there be trouble."**

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2014-11-12 20:28:07)

The Chadra-Fan looks a bit suspiciously over at Vallat, and then looks over at Kurrsk. He shoots another glance at the Besalisks that are still eying the small group.
**"Yes, them probably still mad at Teek. Stupid big folks, just looking to bully small folk like Teek. But they too dumb to know other big folks fooling them!"**
His voice picks up a higher pitch at the last sentence, but the words are probably impossible to make out unless you are standing right next to him, or have rather sensitive hearing.

**"They tell guards that Teek cheat! Say Teek have skifter in sleeve! Teek don´t even have sleeve! Teek never cheat, Teek just much better than big folks. But no one believe Teek"**

SEnsing that Teek didn't know anything that would be helpful beyond what he'd already said, Deeg tell him, **We'll see what we can do, but I doubt they'll just give you back your credits. Let us go now and see what we can do.** 
Nodding to Kurrsk and Vallat, Deeg steps back from the little guy and moves to his companions. In a low voice, **Well at least we should be able to pick them out now. What's our play in there?**
