# The Needs Of The Few

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-22 16:20:52)

<div style="text-align: center;">
*One hundred and thirty-nine years after Luke Skywalker led Rebel forces to a decisive victory over Palpatine&#39;s First Galactic Empire, the galaxy is once again learning to live at relative peace. It&#39;s been a year since Cade Skywalker killed the Sith Lord Darth Krayt. An amalgam of the Jedi Order, Empire, and the Galactic Alliance Remnant work to restore all that was undone during his reign. Now collectively referred to as the Galactic Federation Triumverate, their task will not be an easy one.
It&#39;s a time of change, of growth and of opportunity&#8230; for everyone. True, the Sith still lurk in the shadows - as do all who wish to make a living off of the misfortune of others - but not all change is bad, and there are plenty who seek to aid in the heroic efforts to restore the galaxy to a place of relative peace and safety. Two such heroes, Jakira Boton and Wes Del-Fin, a Zeltron and a Mandalorian, work alongside relief operations and provide support in whatever ways a second-generation doctor and veteran war master can&#8230;*

Making their way through the hyperlanes back to Coruscant, the crew of the *Sojourn* are enjoying a rare moment's rest between operations. The converted medical bays are empty, the droids are shut down or busy about their work, and - for *once* - there's nothing demanding immediate attention. The blurred starlines outside the ports cast a soothing blue glow about the ship as the gentle hum of the engines drones in the background...

An armored hand tapped one last button on the pilots controls and looked up to the blurred starlines outside. Leaning back into the pilots chair the Mandalorian let out a sigh closing his eyes as he went through a calming ritual that had become second nature to him. A feeling of clam and serenity fell over him. Any who had known him during and after the Vong War would have been surprised at the change in the Mandlaorian. Anger came quick to the man, especially in battle where it served a purpose. Though the Mandalorian Knight that now sat in the pilots chair was a much different person. Much of that was due to discovering his ability with the Force and the woman he now travels with. A smile crossed his face as he realized that maybe she had more to do with it than the Force.
A quick glance at the chrono told him that the trip to Courscant would take almost two days. The smile remained upon his face as it was two days of down time that was well deserved. The last few months had been non-stop for them working relief efforts for the Triumvirate. Though relief sometimes had to come from the smoking end of a blaster or the hum of a lightsaber. Still they were trying effect a change. From the looks of it they were doing something right.
Standing up he looked at the R8 astromech droid that functioned as his co-pilot and assistant mechanic for the *Sojourn.* **"Artie plug into the ship and run a diagnostic. Make sure things are running within normal parameters. Any problems let me know. After that feel free to plug in and shutdown for a while."**
The droid responded with a series of beeps. Wes gave a chuckle and nodded. **"Yeah I'm pretty sure we can get you an oil bath. You've earned it."** Giving the droid a pat which caused a metallic clank he reached for his helmet and strode from the cockpit towards the lounge.
The ship was quiet with no one else aboard other than himself, Jakira and the droids. Reaching out with the Force he felt her presence in the place he was heading. He sent a feeling of peace letting her know all was ok. Crossing the threshold into the lounge was a change of comfort. The upgrade luxury package that Jakira wanted had been expensive. Begrudgingly Wes had admitted that it was nice. It hadn't been what he was used to but he had become more accustomed to it. That's not to say that he wouldn't give up the chance to sleep against a bulkhead wearing his armor for days on end.
Seeing her at the holochess board he walked over and sat down placing his helmet and carbine on the padded seat next to him. **"Artie is running a ship wide diagnostic. We'll be at our destination in about two days. Cyar'ika, that's two days of well deserved rest. A nice change of pace from the norm."** A half smile appeared on his face. It was one he reserved only for her as he started removing his armor gauntlets.

Jakira stares absently at the holochess board in front of her. While normally when they were on a planet the lounge served more as a reception area for her patients it was nice to finally have the space to herself. Her two assistant droids were off cleaning up the patient rooms and the cargo holds turned wards, an ongoing task when there was spare time. In the cockpit she could sense Wes’ constant, reassuring presence. Always in tune with her partner’s frame of mind, she can sense him going through his almost ritualistic calming techniques. Closing her eyes, she lets the peace and quiet envelop her own thoughts.
Much had changed in the two years since he had first walked into her small hospital on the backwater world of Solsis VII, her home. Subsequent events had resulted in them both having to flee from the sanctuary, hunted by the Sith for one reason or another. Jakira had been forced to change a lot over the next year, becoming more of a warrior then she’d ever thought possible. She wore armor to hide her identity and they both trained in the Force to better protect themselves. While she didn’t have the same aptitudes as Wes when it came to using it in combat, she’d been able to find her own path. With a little bit of help. She’d never been able to explain it, but sometimes when she quieted her thoughts she could hear Mahchen speaking to her, urging her to focus.
Then a year ago, the Sith’s power was broken and they dispersed into the shadows once more. With the Sith no longer in power, Wes and she had decided it was time to stop running and make something of their gifts. Spending a year in constant fear the Sith would find them, had made them wary, but not unwilling to take advantage of the change in government.
After retrieving the hefty sum stockpiling in Jakira’s untouched trust, she’d purchased this ship and they’d spent a few months getting it up to her satisfaction before approaching the Triumverate, ready to help with the continuing relief efforts. One thing was for sure; there wasn’t a lack of people in need.
They had spent over a month on this last planet, working with the local government as a sign of good will on behalf of the Triumverate. The need was great, but even after their supplies had run dry Jakira had left her ship’s doors open discovering like she always did the local resources to aid her relief efforts. With some sadness she knew when it was time to leave, having done everything she knew was within her power. She’d taught several of their healers what she knew and had left them better for her visit.
She doesn’t have to look up as Wes enters the lounge and takes the seat across from her at the holochess table. Acknowledging the words, she smiles like she always does at hearing his term of endearment. The next two days were to be a welcome relief after the last month of constant work. Looking up at him, she watches for a long moment as he begins to pull of the gauntlets to the armor he wore like a second skin. Her armor was stacked in the cargo hold where Wes had his training equipment and the smuggler’s compartment keeping the Akaan’e holocron safe. She didn’t like wearing her armor and over the last year she could count the instances she’d done so on one hand. Instead she had gone back to the form fitting tops and pants she’d worn before the Sith had caused her to hide herself. The white wrap around smock serving as her armor of choice when dealing with patients.
“**Two days?**” she asks watching him and smirks. “**Enough time to catch up on other things?**” Drawing out a pause she adds as an after thought. “**Including rest.**”

Wes raised an eyebrow at her comment as he inhaled. **"Not too much rest I hope as there are plenty of those other things to do. Though eight hours of continuous sleep curled up next you would be nice."** He leaned forward carefully placing his still armored forearms on the holochess table as his eyes took her in and spied a wisp of pinkish white hair had broken free.
The armor that she had worn for a time was in the cargo bay. It had served its purpose during the year that they were on the run from the Sith. Now though she was back to wearing the type of clothing she used to when they had first met and if he had to be honest it didn't bother him one bit. It seemed like ages ago but in all reality if was just over two years. She had changed and for the better so he thought. She was tougher, more sure of herself physically. Living and training with a Mandalorian had that effect of a person. He had pushed her hard at times but the effect was worth it in his eyes. She could handle herself now in pretty much any situation. His gaze fell from her eyes to her shoulders and arms. They were more tone now. Beguiling a hidden strength and unwavering will that would surprise any who underestimated her.
Arvendus was also tough on him as well. The Warmaster had told him that if he decided to learn the ways of the Mandalorian Knight he would be sundered, smelted, and forged anew. And he was. It would be unfortunate, especially now, if anyone underestimated him and just took him for a man in some armor.
She was also gifted in the Force. More gifted than he was he had felt. Their training in the Force was different but they were able to share through their link with each other. Arvendus was his teacher in the Force while Mahchen spoke to her from beyond the veil. Wes had met the man only briefly but in that short time, and from what he had learned from Jakira, he was an man with possibly no equal.
In two days they would be at Courscant. A city planet that was, for all intents and purposes, the center of the galaxy. Anything and everything was probably available there. His gaze went back up to her eyes. **"So I believe I owe you a dinner and a night out. Think we can fit that into our schedule? And I promise…no armor will be worn during the evening."** He finished with a wink.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-23 13:55:25)

Jakira’s face is alight with delight as she contemplates the possibilities Wes was offering. It was rare enough they went out, just the two of them, and rarer still when Wes willingly went out into public without his Mandalorian armor. Well… unless he didn't intend on an evening out in the town, which would be fine with her as well.
Her game against the computer forgotten, Jakira flips the switch to turn off the holographic game pieces. Having escaped from the tight knot, tendrils of her pink white hair fall into face as she leans forward, matching Wes’ posture and letting her chin fall into her hands. “**Quite an occasion, and why do you owe me?**” she asks with a small smile, gazing back at him.

### **Yogi** (2014-04-23 16:06:50)

**"Well,"** He said as he reached out to wrangle the stray hair behind one of her ears. **"It's not so much owe but I think *we* deserve a pleasnt evening out."** They had been so busy that time alone or for themselves had been few and far between. **"Where better to do it than Coruscant. Things have changed since you were last lived there. They really changed from my time. Maybe we can get a suggestion from some of our contacts on a place to go. Eat, entertainment and a place to bunk…um spend the night."** He smiled as he almost said bunk down. **"Let's face it we need a breather. A time to wind down and relax. The galaxy can get along without us for a day or two. I think."** He raised an eyebrow like before waiting for her answer.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-23 17:12:21)

A tumbling noise in the main passage way and BD-S4 comes stumbling through from the nearest room: "**Pardon me, Mister Wes, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. Might I recommend the *Ccrusty Sarlacc*? It's a lovely restaurant not too far from the Coruscant Droid Spa. I'm sure you'd really enjoy yourselves!**" The luxury droid, not typically known for her stealth or tact, stares at the pair with her shiny metallic gaze. What she lacked in tact she made up for in enthusaism.

Apologies - a little something to play with. I think we're losing power here, so I wanted to get this up asap. CDS is a real place - look it up! ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2014-04-23 20:58:56)

As Wes reaches over to capture a stray tendril of hair her eyes close at the touch. Before he can draw his hand away, she catches it in her own. Feeling the rough calluses from his larger hand, it still astounded her after all this time just how different he was then with anyone else. Still leaning forward she takes his captured hand into both of hers and lets them rest in front of them.
“**That sounds like a great idea,**” Jakira says thinking back to when she was last on Coruscant. “**It’s been a decade at least, but I think I can find something for us to do.**” Her words come to halt as BD stumbles into the lounge offering her recommendation.
She can’t help but laugh at the less than subtle hint. “**And I’m sure that an evening at the Droid Spa wouldn’t go unappreciated by our droid companions.**” Her face is alight with delight at the prospect of the evening out. “**Ooo.. And then we can visit the Rings! They’re quite breath taking this time of year and I think it’s something you’ve never seen.**” Smiling mischievously she adds as an after thought. “**One of these days we’ll have to go to Zeltros. Though we’ll need more than just a day or two.**”

### **Yogi** (2014-04-23 22:19:20)

Her excitement shown through at the thought of a evening out. It really had been too long since they spent some quality time together. As she started talking about when she was last there BD entered the lounge and gave a suggestion. He shook his head as he looked at the female looking droid. **"Have you and Artie been communicating? He asked about the same thing not ten minutes ago."**. He looked back at Jakira. **"I think they are conspiring against us."** 
When she mentioned the rings he nodded. When Zeltros was mentioned he cocked his head to the side. She had talked about her home before but generally the topic of going there was never brought up.
He brought his other hand over to hers and placed it over her two that held his. **"I remember hearing about the rings when they formed. I never saw them intact though. They had been broken apart by the planet that was reported to be living. After the war I never returned to Coruscant. As you know my parents died three months before the war ended. I had chip on my shoulder the size of an ISD and I was angry at pretty much everything. Coruscant looked like a Vong planet from their shapers remaking it in their image. The last thing I wanted was reminders of the Vong and what they had almost accomplished.** He paused for a moment. **"Now for Zeltros I've never been there but you already know that."**

### **Alicia** (2014-04-23 22:59:20)

Jakira laughs at the notion the droids were conspiring against them. They’d never bothered to perform memory wipes on the droids so it wasn’t unheard of their droid companions were beginning to develop their own personalities. “**They do all have internal commlinks,**” she reminds her partner. “**And they have been working hard. I think we all could do with some… pampering.**” She just nearly purrs the word. Turning back to BD she gives the humanoid droid a nod. “**You can tell Artie and Nan that we’ll make sure you all get the spa day you deserve once we get to Coruscant.**”
Wes’ next statement makes her grow more serious, her smile turning ever so slightly to a forwn. Every so often, Jakira forgot just how far out of time Wes was. Sometimes, things would come up to remind her and of all the people he had lost because of the displacement. It wasn’t just time he had lost, it was time with the people he had known and were now long dead. “**You likely didn’t miss much. Coruscant is very much a city again… though there are still traces of what the Vong did. Believe it or not, a lot of the Vong technology was put to good use after the war. There were many planets which had been decimated during the war. The Vong terraforming actually allowed the Galactic Alliance to rebuild the ecology of many worlds.**”

While facial expressions might not be something even luxury droids were capable of, there's an audible sigh of relief from S4 as she claps her hands once and then hurries off to tell the others. It'd been ages since any of them had received a proper oil bath, and the news is well-received - if the high-pitched chirps and beeps heard down the hall is any indication.
A cursory browsing of the Holonet would reveal the details of the Yuuzhan Vong War. While it's generally accepted to have ended over one hundred years ago, there were still Vong to be found here and there, and hostile sentiments did still exist. Coruscant, however, was nearly fully-restored to its former condition - a crowded, urbanized planetscape. Lots of places for a pair of young adventurers to find a night away from the stresses of life...
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I'm absolutely content to have you two RPing and such. Yogi - you set it up for two days, so just let me know when you're all set and I'll post about what happens when you come out of hyperspace. Cheers!

Wes felt her presence in the Force shift slightly when he mentioned his parents. His feeling of loss and being out of place, not so much anymore, seemed to resonate within her. She was always understanding of his feelings. She had her own experiences with loss. It was nothing new to either of them.
As easily as breathing he reached out to her with the Force. His presence sure and confident about the way things were now. **"Cyar'ika it's alright. Remember, Aliit ori'shya tal'din. Even though my family from the past are Cuy'val Dar, they are still with me."** He gave her hands a squeeze as he looked into her eyes. **"I have new family now."**
He was quiet for a few seconds and his gaze lowered before speaking again. **"As far as the Vongese go it wouldn't bother me if i never saw them again. What they did to the Galaxy, what they did to Ithor. It was a beautiful planet and firestorm was set upon it."** He paused again. **"I'm glad some of their tech was able to help other worlds."** His presence cooled a bit as he spoke about the memory that happened more than a hundred years earlier. He could still remember seeing it on the holoscreen. When his gaze once again returned to Jakira his presence warmed up again. It was then he realized just how much he needed a couple days alone with her.

Aliit ori'shya tal'din - "Family is more than bloodline."
Cuy'val Dar - "Those who no longer exist"
Vongese - Yuuzhan Vong or just Vong

### **Alicia** (2014-04-24 13:28:43)

Jakira’s frown relaxes into a small smile. It was easy to be understanding of feelings when one felt them very strongly from others. While Zeltrons are naturally empathic, her own Force abilities only seemed to amplify the gift. She knew that while Wes’ words said one thing and he believed in what he was saying, he was still bothered by the situation. Who wouldn’t be? She had to admit he had adjusted quite well to having been thrown a hundred years from what he knew.
Squeezing his hand back Jakira smiles at him genuinely. Her look grows mischievous as she picks up on his thoughts. “**Two days isn’t going to be long enough.**”
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ready to move on, I think.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-24 15:50:51)

The two finish their time together - and repeat the scene a number of times over the next forty-odd hours, mostly uninterrupted by the satisfied droids. Rest and relaxation seemed to be on all the minds aboard the *Sojourn*, organic *and* digital alike.
The gentle alarms chime to signify the impending drop from hyperspace and everyone heads up to the cockpit or nearest port to watch. No matter how many times one does it, the sight of stars coming into focus never seems to get dull. Even the saltiest spacer would have to admit traveling at the speed of light brought a certain variety to life. The crystal clarity of dropping from hypertravel brings the almost imperceptible 'bump' throughout the ship, and then - Coruscant. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The planet bustles with activity from surface to orbit and beyond. Hundreds of ships can be seen and counted by the naked eye alone, some smaller than *Sojourn*, some much, much larger. The local authorities ask for clearance in that stereotypical droning voice of dutiful disinterest:
"**Standby to transmit transpoder ID and nature of visit…**"
Before Wes can answer, however, R8 sends not only the ship's codes but also intended destination along in a burst of Binary. Someone's anxious for that oil bath...
The crew sets down on a landing pad about midway between the Coruscant Droid Spa and S4's recommended dining location. Thankfully, there are plenty of other places to choose from, as the tacky and brightly-colored sign for the *Ccrusty Sarlacc* can be seen in the distance, spinning slowly. The numbers directly below it rise steadily, a total of all those who've been served there. It's just about noon, local time, though, and Wes and Jakira find themselves in a section of the megalopolis that some might refer to as 'high-scale', (despite the smattering of omnipresent food chains) which sometimes only means more snobs, crankier waitstaff, and law enforcement that doesn't mind look the other way. Still, it could be worse - they've both *seen* it. A quick search of the area brings up several restaurants of varying specialty and more than a few places to spend a couple days not breathing recycled air and bunking aboard a stuffy ship. Amenities vary there also, but the selection is appropriate for what the two have in mind.
As Wes and Jakira study the holographic map and discuss their intended destination, the trio of droids all make their way down the *Sojourn*'s boarding ramp and head off in the opposite direction. S4 manages an enthusiastic wave back but quickly returns to the rapid beeping, buzzing, whirring, and clicking that can only signify an excited conversation in true Binary.
"**Anything I can do to help you folks out?**" asks an approaching officer. Now that they take a real look around, it's obvious to both Wes and Jakira that there's heightened security at the landing pad. The officer's hand rests casually on his hip holster but with the air of someone who takes his duty seriously. He eyes Wes with the greatest suspicion - he's not exactly dress casual. What a Mandalorian might want with a Zeltron in his district wasn't his business... unless it *became* his business.

Okay. ~~Not saying you can't have your stuff, but you mentioned no armor. If you need me to, I can edit that last sentence - but not the whole post. Full armor *will* mean a different reaction from folks, good or bad.~~ And it's on you to pick a place to eat/stay - you come up with the fun names this time! ![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)

The two days of down time was what the doctor had ordered, a welcomed change of pace from the last few months of almost nonstop on the go. The time allowed the couple to do the things couples do. Simply spend some quality time together free from interruptions and the galaxy that always seemed to need something done. That simple fact that no one was gunning for them was a bonus treat.
--------------------
Wes made sure the ship gave him an alert an hour ahead of time to when the ship would drop from real space. This gave the Mandalorian ample time to armor up before hand. When Jakira saw him in the armor he reassured her it was only till they figured out where to spend the evening. Till then though he'd be in his Besker'gam.
--------------------
Dropping out of hyperspace the *Sojourn* reappeared among at the outskirts of the system. Hundreds of ships of varying sizes were ahead of them. It wasn't long till they were contacted for ID and destination. Even before Wes could respond respond R8 sent the required information. Glancing to his right he looked at his droid copilot. **"Anxious aren't you?"** R8 responded with a few beeps and a loud blert. Wes held up a hand in defense and chuckled. **"Don't worry I said you can go."** A few beeps in response and Wes knew the droid was happy. So much so he was already leaving the cockpit to meet up with the other droids.
---------------------
True to her word the platform wasn't far from the *Ccrusty Sarlacc* like BD had said. Looking out the cockpit's transparent steel glass they looked to be in the heart of a fairly busy somewhat upscale commerce section. **"Well Jakira it doesn't look to bad out there. We should be able to find something to so this afternoon."** He said with a smile as he still looked outside. ***More importantly this evening.*** He sent a mental thought to her as he hoped to continue the last two days for a while longer or as long as time allowed. He grabbed his helmet and carbine. The latter he attached to the sling which always kept it by his side. Turning around he indicated to the outside with a nod of his head. **"You ready to go?"**
Arriving at the boarding ramp which was already down due to the droid making a hasty retreat away from the ship. Helmet still tucked under his arm he began to make his way down the ramp with Jakira by his side. To anyone with any combat background it would have been easy to tell that security was in a heightened state. To Wes it screamed out to him. The deck officer's question only adds to the notion. Wes made sure to keep his hand away from his carbine. There was no sense in making the man nervous. ***Something has security on a bit of an alert***. He thought to her knowing that she would have already picked up on it. The link between them served as an advantage giving them the ability to communicate with each other with out anyone else noticing.
Like they have in the past Wes put on the show of being the body guard for Jakira. It was a tactic that always seemed to work well for them in the past. He waited for Jakira to address the officer.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Wes has his armor, carbine, Lightsaber and the integrated equipment that built into his armor. Not a lot but enough for a look around.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-25 14:23:34)

The next two days went by very quickly for the Zeltron and it’s with some disappointment she watches from their bed as Wes dresses in his armor listening to his reassurances it was only till they figured out how they were spending their evening. It was nice to just relax and pursue whatever came to mind rather than having to worry about patients.
She sighs as Wes finishes and leaves for the cockpit to get them planetside. Rolling out, she changes quickly in her usual attire, her top covering the nasty and only scar marring her visage located on her shoulder. Two years ago she had taken a blaster shot which went right through her shoulder. It had been her first firefight and ended up marking one of her last nights on Solsis VII. It was a sad reminder of everything she had lost those last nights.
Collecting her gear she bides her time till they land by looking through the holonet directory for the area around their landing pad. Finding a first rate hotel nearby she makes the reservation for the next couple evenings. *Now this brings back memories*, she thinks recalling the first place they had stayed at after the Captain Kurr and No Chance had ditched them. On thing was for sure: “The Queen’s Jewel” was calling her name. Never one to miss out on an opportunity to plan an evening out she looks over the local activities, smiling to herself as she plans their itinerary.
Finally, Jakira feels them touch down and she heads towards the ramp, eager to be off the ship. Shaking her head with laughter, she watches as the trio of droids eagerly head towards the spa. *I’m not the only one happy to be getting off the ship.* As Wes joins her, her smile widens as he mentions finding something to do. “**Oh.. I have it all figured out.**” Patting her trusty side-arm pistol in the holster at her hip, Wes is more than certain she has her hold-out pistol in the top of her boot as well. As she steps out of the ship, her thoughts aren’t on their surroundings, but as Wes comments about them she can’t help but take her own look around. ***Well… won't this prove interesting.*** she responds back to him.
When the dock officer steps towards them, her wariness is hidden by her races’ typical good natured smile as she looks the man over. While not moving directly towards the officer, she makes it so they meet him part of the way. “**Ah officer.. Maybe you could point us toward the taxis?**"

Persuasion +15 to increase the officer’s attitude towards them

Jakira has her side-arm blaster visible, with a hold out blaster hiding on her person. Her utility will have the various tools of her profession, but doubt any of that would raise suspicions.

Lt. Braddock had nearly twenty years with various security agencies across the galaxy and had seen too many things to ignore the oddity before him.
*A Mando and his spacer chick? What's the angle…?*
He thought about it a moment, hand tightening on his sidearm... and then it him. There was some skill on display here, that was for sure, but Braddock had his guilty pleasures just like everybody else. This was *definitely* Jerik'a, the hottest musician and holovid star this side of the Outer Rim. Obviously, she was traveling incognito with a lone bodyguard. It made perfect sense. Coruscant was an easy enough place to get lost for a few days out of the spotlight, but who knew - maybe he was being recorded *right now*! And the bodyguard, well, maybe he had other uses.
*Lucky guy…*
"**Well *Miss*,**" Braddock managed, giving his best approximation of extreme deference, "**If you don't mind waiting right here just a moment, I'll *get* one for you!**"
True to his word, in under a minute a representative of one of Coruscant's finest chauffeur services pulls up to Wes and Jakira. Braddock, who'd been feigning a radio conversation while looking anxiously for the paparazzi sure to be lurking about, smiles and opens the door: "**Have a pleasant afternoon, folks!**"
The luxury cab was a sleek black covered speeder, typical of what A-list celebrities and high-ranking government officials might use without a second thought to its audacious comfort. The driver greets the par with a simple nod and tip of his hat. "**Where to?**"

Wes could easily sense the mans emotions as he did nothing to hide them. Not that he had a reason to. How could the officer know he was in the company of two Force users. There was a sense of caution and suspicion that Wes could sense as they stood before him. In keeping up with act Wes kept a look out on the platform when Jakira asked for a taxi.
All of a sudden the mans presence shifted from cautious to surprise and elation and possibly envy. Wes wasn't quite sure what had happened to cause this. When he offered to call a taxi for them Wes looked at Jakira with a raised eyebrow. **"Thank you."**. He said with no particular emotion. When he spied the black luxury speeder pull up Wes simply gave a small sigh as he looked up to the sky before putting on his helmet.
***Typical.*** He thought with some amusement as he spied the officer looking around for people that weren't there.
Wes moved to the speeder and allowed Jakira to get into the speeded first. **"Miss."** He said as stepped to the side. As she entered he turned to the officer. **"Sir,"**. His voice sounded out from his helmet. **"I've noticed that security is heightened here in the area. For the lady's protection may I know he cause of it?"**
When he got the information, useful or not, he gave the officer a nod and entered the speeder. Looking at Jakira he smiled beneath his helmet. **"I don't even need to ask to know that you're enjoying this."** The humor in his voice was easily recognizable to her. **"So where are we heading?"**

The change in the lawman’s impression of them changed drastically as he began making his own assumptions about them She could always see the gears ticking in his head as she smiled at him. While she got the impression he believed she was someone important, she wasn’t inclined to dissuade him from the belief and he left to get them a ride.
Glancing over at Wes, Jakira knows how this turn was going to sit with him. He never quite understood how she was able to get people to respond to her like the officer was now. Jakira’s smile grows wider as she looks at the exasperation on his face before he puts his helmet on. Her bemusement filters through to him in the Force as wells as her abject pleasure at seeing the limo the officer brings around. **i*He thinks I’m a celebrity*** she casually informs Wes her amusement evident in her thoughts. She certainly is enjoying herself.
Clapping her hands together in pleasure Jakira beams at the officer. “**Wonderful. Much better than a taxi.**” Before she slides into the limo she asks, “**Oh officer… you are?**” Getting her answer she leaves Braddock with an enigmatic smile, declining to mention who she is. As the door is opened for her she slides in letting Wes take his time in joining her as she looks around at the various features. It’d been awhile since she’d had the opportunity to ride in one.
“**What’s the purpose to life if you can’t find some enjoyment?**” she looks into the visor of Wes’s helmet as if she could see through the plates. Maybe she could.. “**It’s the little things after all.**” Now directing her comments to the driver she says, “**Queen’s Jewel in the Old Senate plaza.**”

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-26 12:38:06)

"**Well,**" Braddock takes eyes off Jakira to address Wes' question, "**We usually keep things pretty tight around here. Sometimes, though, it's best to have a visible presence.**" He pauses, certain that a Mando bodygard could identify with that concept. "**The Triumverate's still a baby, you know, and there's still a lot of folks that'd be more than happy to see it fail. A recent string of… incidents, I guess you'd call them… has everyone on edge. A couple places got hit pretty bad - hospitals, medical distribution centers, places like that. Probably just some spacer punks trying to make a name for themselves, but, well…**" This answer was already taking longer than he'd anticipated. Maybe it was because he was caught up in the chance to be of real use to a celebrity, or just to swap gossip with someone that hadn't yet heard, but Braddock's mouth was moving faster than usual. "**Thing is,**" he continues in a hushed tone, "**There's never any *bodies* left. Signs of struggle and all that, but not a single *witness* left.**"
The Lieutenant looks away and around the landing pad, surveying his domain and giving the appraoching speeder a once-over. "**Nothing for you to worry about, though. I'm sure you'll be just fine.**" Hearing Jakira's question, he leans down and responds with a big smile: "**Braddock, Miss, Lieutenant Prett Braddock.**"<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

The driver, a well-dressed Zabrak with dark skin and bright eyes, nods in affirmation to Jakira's command. He passes his gaze ever so briefly over Wes's intimidating form before closing the window between them and heading off for the *Queen's Jewel*. The drive takes only a few minutes and then Wes and Jakira are deposited at the "ground" level of the vast superstructure. There's easily dozens of sub-levels though, so they've still got quite a few. There are some tables and chairs set up outside the reception area, though the red carpet clearly beckons them to the desk inside. A cough from the Zabrak, looking for a tip - if not the entire fare owed him - brings their attention back to the speeder. The main office hadn't said anything about who he was picking up but the lady did have a somehow familiar appearance. He couldn't quite place her but it wasn't the first time he'd ferried VIPs, and they often went in disguise anyway. That guy in armor wasn't messing around. Bodyguard? Fares were usually taken care of in advance anyway.
*Usually*.
"**Have a nice day…!**" he manages, hoping it would prompt some sort of payment.
After resolving the fare, or ignoring the cabbie altogether, Wes and Jakira find the front desk attendant to check themselves in. A chipper young Gungan in formal attire appears behind the counter, her floppy ears hanging loose in an odd juxtaposition against her uniform: "**Greetings! How'sa can I be helpin' you dis day?**"

Wes closed the limo door and looked at Jakira. He didn't say anything as he looked ahead to the driver as he received instructions on where to go. Wes caught the glance the driver gave him and he could feel the unsettling feeling the driver felt with having a mandalorian as a passenger.
When the privacy window closed he looked at Jakira who seemed pretty happy with herself. **"Celebrity huh. I've given up trying to figure it out. Must be that beautiful face of yours."** He looked around the interior of the limo before continuing. **"What officer Braddock had to say was interesting. Hits on medical facilities with no witnessss. I wonder if we can get some info on what's going on from our contacts here. Hopefully it's none of the places we deal with for our supplies."**. He saw the look on her face and the possibility of their evening out being in jeopardy. **"Don't worry after we've taken our time."**
To be honest he was looking forward to some more time quality time before the next mission or assignment they were able to get from the triumvirate. The credits were decent and working for the three, even being independent, from the government allowed them some benefits. He made no effort to hide his feelings from Jakira. His hope was that they could get through the next day or two before moving on the the next problem.
They arrived infront of the Queens Jewel. Getting out of the limo Wes kept up the bodyguard act as he looked around not taking no notice of any looks he may draw. Hearing the driver cough Wes knew what the man wanted. He made sure the driver was paid for the fare and a decent tip. The ride wasn't long so it didn't add up to too much.
Upon reaching the front desk Wes was surprised to see a Gungan arrive. He waited for Jakira to begin working her magic on the receptionist.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-27 21:31:13)

Leaving Wes to take care of the driver, Jakira practically sashays up the red carpet and past the bell hop to the receptionist. She knew this would likely draw the eye of the appreciative observer, but she was in the mood to be noticed. It had been far too long since she’d been able to draw peoples’ attentions. Instead she allowed them to see her and then to take notice of the Mandalorian following not far behind.
Giving the receptionist her usual beaming smile, Jakira raises her voice only loud enough for the Gungan to pick up, “**I have a reservation under Lyshaa.**” Perhaps old habits die hard as she gives the alias she had been using over the last couple years. “**And I’d appreciate it if you could have something… special sent up from the kitchen,” she gives the Gungan a wink as she casts a glance over at Wes.

Having taken care of the driver Wes turnes and makes for the entrance. The place seemed pretty upscale the fact of which shouldn't have surprised him. Leave it to Jakira to make the best of things. It jogged a memory from two years ago when they had been stranded by the *No Chance.* It's captain, a Feeorin named Kurr, stranded them. Suffice to say Jakira and Wes didn't see eye to eye with the captain. With his first chance he left them to their own devices. Thinking back on it it was probably for the best as the Sith would have been looking for the *No Chance* not two on their own.
Crossing the hotels threshold into the lobby Wes noticed that all eyes were on Jakira. He wasn't surprised. Zeltrons tended to draw looks and she was definitely no exception to that rule. If anything could make one turn away from a alluring Zeltron female it was and armored Mandalorian. The looks she received, from either sex, never bothered him. Yet he couldn't help from smiling as they seemed to find something else to look at as he strode up to her. His hand holding the grip on his carbine as he posed as her guard.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-28 17:54:51)

"**Somethin'… *special*…?**" responds the young Gungan, obviously stirred to action by Jakira's wiles but confused as to what exactly she might be asking for. She spots Wes and then exclaims with a wink of her own: "**Ah! Yousa no needin' to be sayin' no more 'bout *dat*.**" She turns to a console and types for a moment, bringing up the display of Jakira's - Lyshaa's - reservations. The pair are directed to the main turbolifts down the hall while the attendant makes off in the opposite direction. It's a good bet the kitchen lies that way, as does the Gungan's interpretation of '*something special*'...
The lift brings Wes and Jakira up to one of the very top floors where, true to Jakira's tastes, there is a luxurious deluxe suite. Full amenities all around and a private landing just right for dinner, stargazing, or anything else the two might have in mind. They're high enough up that the bulk of traffic is below them, with only incoming and outbound ships venturing so high from the travel lanes. The sunlight reflects of the endless landscape of domes, rooftops, and superstructures that sprawl across the surface of the planet - a perfect contrast to the clear blue skies above. Inside the suite, a divan and large couch circle the latest in personal entertainment holocenters. Against the wall is something closer to a computer terminal. The kitchenette is fully-stocked, in case anyone wants to whip up a late afternoon snack, though the main kitchen has someone on call at all hours of the day - according to the menu currently displayed on the terminal. Everywhere are perfect arrangements of ornately woven rugs, abstract art, or, in just the right spots, simple open space. The bedchamber sports its own gorgeous view, a full bath, and state-of-the-art comfort in the form of an enormous bed. Clearly, the *Jewel* caters to all manner of species... with all manner of tastes. In short, the suite is everything Jakira had expected and then some.
Everything, that is, until the terminal alternates to a non-intrusive but still obvious alert. It reiterates that guests keep their door cards with them at all times and to follow all standard building procedures in the case of emergency, posted at the intersections of the main halls and inside the turbolifts. Whether it's policy to loop it on the display for new guests or as a direct result of the recent security concerns is anyone's guess. At any rate, it switches back to the silent ad for the *Queen Jewel*'s various services after a couple seconds.

Arriving at the suites door Wes used his card to gain access to the room and stepped in first looking around. Seeing that it was empty he quickly stepped out of the way while still holding the door open for his "client". **"Miss."** Was all he said with a wave of his other arm biding her entry into the posh room. There was a hint of amusement in his voice that others might not have caught. Even though he kept his Force presence in close Jakira could feel the self indulgent feelings he was having since seeing the suite. Even though he knew they they deserved some self indulgent time it was places like this that caused him to let his guard down. While good and bad, especially when on the run, it was nice. And since they weren't technically on the run anymore he felt it was due. It had been almost two years since the last time. It was over due.
With the door closed and secured behind Jakira he reached up to remove his helmet and once again looked around. When his gaze fell upon Jakira he smiled and stepped close. **"I think you have outdone yourself this time. You really want this to be a armor free time don't you Cyar'ika?"** He said softly before giving her a soft lingering kiss. **"The Sojourn will seem like a back alley apartment after this place."**
He stepped back and walked further into the suite taking note of the amenities it offered. Letting out a sigh he nodded. ***She sure knows how to find the best.*** He thought to himself.
**"So,"** He said turning around. **"Do we want to let our contacts know we're back or let it wait till at least late tomorrow?"**

### **Alicia** (2014-04-29 15:00:20)

Jakira manages to contain her own enthusiasm as the Gungan seems to catch her meaning and makes the arrangements for her. Part of being so vague however was part of the fun and she was curious to see how the receptionist would interpret ‘something special’. Entering the turbolift with Wes, she can barely contain her excitement as she watches the indicator.
Finally they reach their floor and Wes moves ahead of her to open the door, and in bodyguard style check out the room. She grins at him as the amusement in his tone is not lost on him. Playfully she runs a finger across his chest as she passes him to enter the room.
Taking her first look at the room, Jakira knows at once she had made the proper choice in her selection. While she knows Wes might scoff at the over indulgence, he would agree it had been a long time since she’d been able to partake in the lifestyle which less than a decade ago had been commonplace for her. Running her fingers over the fabric on the back of the couch, she turns to face Wes as he steps in close. Standing on her toes she matches his height and presses her chest against his, letting her hands fold behind his neck.
“**Hmm… Half the fun is getting you out of it,**” she smirks, leaning in for a kiss. Picking up on his thought she adds, “**Finding the best, is a learned skill.**” Letting her feet fall flat on the ground she thinks about his last question. “**Well.. if people are after medical supplies, it might be best to let our contacts know we’re back, just so they can keep the Sojourn on their radar. They might have more information as to who is behind it.**” Smiling after her moment of serious thought. “**But we should clear to tell them they shouldn’t expect anything more than silent comms till we’re good and ready to get back to work.**”

---

### **Yogi** (2014-04-29 17:05:35)

Wes gave her a nod. **"Sounds good. I'll drop them a comm message letting them know we're in system and that we will be running silent till at least the day after tomorrow…at the earliest."**
Wes went to the terminal which had began the alert again about carrying the room card and such. His intent was to send the message right away but precautions took hold. **"I'll sent the Comm from the *Sojourn*. No sense in letting them know exactly where we are."**
Having an idea he quickly brought up a couple news feeds. One for the local area while the other was Courscant as a whole. On both he referenced recent attacks on Medical stations. ***Probably be better to have R8 do this when he gets back to the ship.*** He thought as he sent the query out.
As he thought his face took a serious look to it. **"You know if medical buildings are being hit it's only a matter of time till whoever is behind it will start hitting medical and relief ships."** He sighed as he forced himself to relax. The thought of someone coming after them didn't sit well with the Mandlaorian. He looked at Jakira who was appraising more of the suite. There was going to be plenty of time to deal with things afterwards. ***Maybe I'll tell them three days at the earliest.*** He thought.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-29 20:46:52)

Having moved into the bedroom she was testing the bed. First having sat on it and then bounced experimentally. Now she’s sprawled herself over its surface, satisfied that it will be comfortable. Like a cat, Jakira watches Wes as he manipulate the controls for the entertainment system to watch the HoloNews feeds.
***Three days? Why not a week?*** she says to him with a wide grin, picking up his own thoughts through their link.
Jakira lets her head fall back onto the pillows as his thoughts finally catch up to the worries she had been avoiding since hearing about the hit on the medical facilities. “**Make sure when you send the request to R8, you make sure he stays on alert and locks the ship tight.**” The former had been common practice, but recently they had become lax she knew.
Heaving a heavy sigh, Jakira sits up and moves to his side. “**Ugh… we’re here to relax and enjoy ourselves and all we’re doing is worrying about the blasted ship…**”

---

### **Yogi** (2014-04-29 21:49:19)

**"A week."** Wes said with a laugh as he gave her thought some serious consideration. **"The triumvirate might find someone else to do some relief work for them."** He said teasingly. In all reality he felt that wouldn't happen. The state of affairs of the galaxy after the One Sith had been defeated was pretty bad. There was plenty to do and not enough help to go around. It was like putting a small bacta bandage on a sucking chest wound.
At her suggestion he gave her a nod and sent a message to R8 from his encrypted comlink. As he finished he heard Jakira let out a heavy sigh. Looking up from the console he watched her leave the bed and walk to his side. He not only heard her words but he could feel her frustration through the Force. She wanted some R&R and they were busy worrying about the ship.
**"The message is sent to R8. He will resend it from the Ship. The three of them will also lock it down till we get back."** Turning slightly he faced her and drew her in closer with armored hands resting on her hips. **"Now with all that taken care of I seem to remember you just mentioning something about rest and relaxation. Which is something that the good doctor has ordered. No more worrying about the ship, droids, or the next job. Just you and I for the next however many days."** He looked down and into her eyes and smiled.

### **Alicia** (2014-05-01 14:56:06)

Jakira allows herself to be drawn against Wes’s armored body. It wouldn’t be long now till she was able to get him out of it. Without much persuasion at that.
“**Well, we at least have a few hours before D8 sends the message to our contacts and they respond.**” With one hand she begins to loosen his gauntlets and smiles at him conspiratorily. “**Enough time to at least enjoy the room.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-05-01 20:29:09)

And so it goes for some time. Wes and Jakira are interrupted only once, after half an hour, for a delivery from the kitchen: the *special thing* turns out of to be an array of fresh fruits and exotic dips native to Zeltros. Served on ornately-decorated silver platters, the dish is not only delightful but known to be a favorite of Jerik'a - the Zeltron megastar Jakira is still being mistaken for.
The afternoon passes quickly for the two and soon it's time for the night out that they've been waiting for. Reservations for two at *Rolo's*, one of the most prestigious restaurants on Coruscant, does little to help the image of being a celebrity and her bodyguard - but few have the audacity to acknowledge it... except, of course, the *real* Jerik'a who just so happens to be there as well, accompanied by her own burly escort. She and Jakira make eye contact at one point and share a knowing grin, much to the confusion of the rookie Twi'lek waitstaff who has been assigned both of their tables. Assorted other elite are in attendance as well, government officials and affluent of the Core worlds. The location - atop one of the highest spires on the planet - attracts only the very wealthy, as most in the galaxy couldn't even afford a *Rolo's* appetizer.<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Time passes and enjoyment is had by all, though of course the Mando and Zeltron might have still had just as good a time in some moldy backwater cantina - it's unlikely they'll have such posh luxury again any time soon and they aren't about to waste a minute of it. It's not until the building's power flickers twice, in fact, that they realize the time - it's been over an hour since they were seated. There's only a few moments for everyone to realize what's happening before the lights go out for good. Anyone checking for comm service finds it's been jammed. Several guests start to make for the doors when they are suddenly stopped short by a trio of Toydarians bearing firearms and low-light goggles.
"**No, pah-lease, *stay!***" comes a jovial voice from the center figure. "**Enjoy your-ah meals, this won't take-ah too long…**"
The two others stay flanking the front doors as four more hover into the room from the back kitchen. The staff are herded out from the back too, the rotund Rodian Rolo among them. The four then break up, leaving one to guard the back exit. The other three begin making their way from table to table, collecting all manner of valuables. From where Wes and Jakira are sitting - just to the left of center dining hall - it'll be a minute or two before any of the Toydarians get to them. It's hard to see in the emergency lighting, but most people have taken their seats and are complying. For some of them, this isn't the first time being held at gunpoint.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So low light level but the rest - including what you are wearing and what you ate and whatnot - is up to you. Wasn't really going for the Russian/Mario accent but it works. We all remember Watto! I'll respond as I can but probably not before Saturday night at the earliest. Enjoy!

### **Yogi** (2014-05-02 13:31:09)

As he picked up on her thoughts his face took on the same mischievous look she wore. ***Like you've ever really needed to persuade me.*** He thought as her fingers began to work at his armor. Over the last couple years she had become almost as good at removing it as he was. It was a procedure but with two sets of hands working it came off quickly.
Free of his armor he stood before her in his black form fitting under garments. With ease he scooped her up in his arms and began walking towards the large luxurious bed she had been sitting on only moments ago. **"Lets start over here."** He said with his own hint of mischievousness.
---------
A half hour later the door chime sounded. Looking at Jakira he smiled. **"Looks like the surprise you requested from the kitchen has arrived."** He rose from the bed and quickly made his way to the door. Spotting the bottoms he had been wearing he hastily attempted to draw on the bottoms that had been haphazardly tossed. Managing to be somewhat presentable he checked who was there and it was indeed room service. Opening the door he smiled at the young Twi'lek female who pushed in the food cart. Quickly taking care of things he closed the door behind the young woman and pushed the cart into the room Looking the array of food over he nodded appreciatively. **"Looks like they went above and beyond."** He said as the exotic aromas wafted up to his senses.

### **Alicia** (2014-05-02 14:41:31)

When Wes had left to answer the door, Jakira follows slowly, grabbing one of the fluffy white robes from the bathroom. Moving to the chaise she lounges watching as Wes wheels the cart the rest of the way into the room.
As each dish is revealed her eyes grow wider. “**Ooh. It’s been awhile since I’ve had this.**” Sitting up she reaches for a piece of the exotic fruit and dips it. “**These are all from Zeltros,**” she explains, taking a bite of her covered fruit. Her eyes close in pleasure as she tastes the rich delicacy. Of course with her metabolism this was more like a special treat before the appetizer.
“**Here try this,**” she says as she dips a different, softer looking fruit into what has to be chocolate and offers it to Wes to taste from her fingers.

---

### **Yogi** (2014-05-02 16:13:43)

Wes took the offered fruit as sat back in the chair. The fruit was fairly juicey and it's slight tartness was off set by the chocolate. **"That's pretty good."** He finally said when he swallowed. It was always interesting to try different foods.
He reached for a piece that had a blue tint to it. He knew to pace himself when it came to eating with the beautiful woman who sat next to him. While eating had never been a problem his human metabolism just couldn't keep up with hers. It was something he had learned the hard way.
**"If all the food on your home planet tastes this good maybe we should head there after our next job.** He eyed the crystal pitcher that contained a pinkish color liquid.

---

### **Alicia** (2014-05-02 16:48:58)

Jakira smiles, enjoying his reaction to the sweet before making up another for herself using a cream inspired dip to cover her next selection. “**Zeltros certainly has it’s charms. Continuous parties, slews of potential lovers, any pleasure you could think of…**” she rambles of a few nonchalantly watching his reaction with her peripheral vision as she enjoys the morsel she had selected. “**And exceedingly strong alcohol**,” she says indicating the pink juice. Grinning she pours them a glass and hands over the drink. “**Most find it a bit sour, but it tastes amazing with this sort of fare.**”

---

### **Yogi** (2014-05-02 17:57:28)

He listened to her as she rattled off all the things that could be found on Zeltros. All of which he had heard about a hundred years before hand and from his time with Jakira. All the things mentioned held a certain flair. He was sure that the reality of her home planet was leaps and bounds above any way it could be described.
Before he awoke from his hibernation he had always been a loner. Never staying in one place long. Never taking a lover for more time than he was in that place. Parties, lovers, pleasures, while maybe not of the Zeltros kind, were not new to him. Barriers had been out up to protect himself. Somehow she had managed to break past the barriers he had set up so long ago. Breached the armor, so to speak, that protected him from all the battles and loss he had witnessed during the Vong war. He was a different person now and for that he knew that no matter what happened in the future he would always love her. He knew she'd pick up on his thoughts and feelings. He had learned years ago that it was dam near impossible to do hide them from her.
Wes took a sip of the pink alcohol. True to her word the drink had a sour taste to it but not so bad that it made it undrinkable. The piece of fruit that followed the drink tasted all the better. **"Might be fun. At least I know I'll have the best person possible to show me around."**

### **Alicia** (2014-05-02 23:58:30)

While Jakira hadn’t grown up on the hedonistic planet of Zeltros she had embraced the lifestyle upon her arrival to administrate her parents’ practice upon their retirement. While residing on the luxury world, she had attempted to fill a void she never really knew existed until she met Mahchen. On a world where the inhabitants shunned such emotions as depression, there had been plenty of distractions to cover it. Like Wes, her relationships held no more substance than for their entertainment value.
Everything had changed for her when she’d agreed to move to Solsis. It wasn’t on good terms she’d left either, having sold the practice and leaving without her parents’ blessing to move to Solsis. Well, she’d seen how well that move had gone.
For a moment Jakira wonders if her parents were still enjoying their retirement in one of their estates on Zeltros or had moved on to other more pleasurable opportunities. It was even possible they had parted ways. Monogamy was a rare practice with her people, lasting as long as it kept the couple’s interest.
Even though Jakira talking about going back, it would only serve as a reminder of all the shallow relationships and life she’d once had. “**I want to go to Solsis…**” she says at last, finally saying the desire she’d held for the past year.
Ever since the One Sith had been defeated, she’d wanted to return. There was a part of her afraid of what she’d find. The Hobben population had been slowly dwindling under Sith rule in just the several months they’d been there. Without an advocate for their well being, how many had survived? Her desire to return, to possibly help pick up the pieces of the world she’d grown to love, overwrote her fear.

### **Yogi** (2014-05-03 20:08:46)

Wes watched Jakira as she sat with him. He could feel the emotions ripple out from her. While they had grown up differently some of their experiences were simular. The distaste for going back to her home world was clear. It was something he could understand. He took another drink of the juice and followed it with a chocolate covered piece of fruit as her worked through her thoughts.
When he heard her mention Solsis he smiled. Even though he only spent a short time the planet held a certain peacefulness to it. Going back would be a good thing. Besides if the sith aligned governor was still in power he figured causing a little unrest was in order. He could already imagine the hutt like human chortling on what ever he was eating at the mention of the two of them returning.
He have her a nod indicating he liked the idea. **"Sounds like a good plan. Maybe we can find out what the state of affairs are like in that sector. Maybe the sith have been driven off. If that governor is still there I'd like to pay him a visit."** His thoughts began to think about the trouble he could cause that man. As quick as the thought came he buried them. Now wasn't the time. Especially when their time in this luxury suite was limited and there was still plenty of the suite to enjoy.

### **Alicia** (2014-05-05 14:10:48)

“**I doubt that coward would have stayed around after the One Sith lost power. If he is there, he’s likely sucking up to whatever power he can get his claws into.**” If anyone could get her worked up it was the cheese loving bulbous governor. A vindictive glint comes into her eyes a she imagines his reactions when they both showed up in their armor. Too many Hobbens had died under his rule, including their leader and elders. It would be his just reward if the Hobben people got their justice, and would give Jakira great satisfaction to see the worm squirm after the destruction he had caused. Perhaps she had too much personal stake in the results.
“**For starters I think I’d be happy to know whether the Triumvirate have made it that far. Maybe we can convince our contact in letting us head there for one our missions. They *could* use the help**.”
Jakira’s thoughts turn to more civil things, happily munching on the fruit and dips till it was all gone. The meal ending up being a satisfying snack.With a pleasant buzz from the alcohol she knew wasn't going to last long, she leans towards Wes. Raising a delicate eyebrow at him she asks slyly, "**Where to next?"**

The idea of checking on Solsis as a future job sounded good to him as he watched her lean forward. The seductive look that crossed her face caused the thought of the next job to be pushed to the back of his mind. Her question made him look back to the bedroom. **"I seem to recall a rather large tub in there. It's been a while since we last shared one."** A knowing smile grew across his face as he reached for the pitcher of alcoholic juice and refilled her glass. Knowing her metabolism would work off the effects twice as fast as his. Finishing off his glass he stood holding out his hand to her. **"Shall we?"**
As they walked he thought about the evening ahead. **"I suppose some shopping is in order for this evening."** It wasn't really a question as he knew the answer already.

---

### **Alicia** (2014-05-07 15:02:18)

Jakira accepts the refilled glass with a grin and takes Wes’s proffered hand, holding it as they make their way to the bathroom. “**That’s what concierge services are for… However, it would be a change of venue and definitely something I would enjoy. Would be nice to wander.**” Her delicate eyebrow raises in amusement as an image of Wes shopping for clothes comes to mind. “**Of course if you don’t want to come with me, I think I could get by without your company for a few hours.**” She lets her expression turn into a pout as she looks up at him.
Entering the bathroom she releases his hand to bend over the tub and turns on the faucet. Hot steam quickly mixes with the air. Turning around to face Wes, she leans against the rim of the tub and takes a long sip of the juice. “**Last time we did this, we both had some clothes on,**” she reminisces with amusement.

### **Yogi** (2014-05-07 16:38:13)

The thought of clothes shopping was as exciting to him as blaster shopping was to Jakira. Then again it wasn't like they could stay inside the whole time. Then a devious idea came to mind as they reached the threshold of the bathroom. **"I suppose I could be convinced to go shopping."**
His eyes watched her form as she walked to the bath and started the water. The fluffy robe did little to hide the figure that was underneath. When she spoke about the last time they shared a bath he smiled and walked closer till he stood in front of her. A hand reached up to play with the tie that held the robe closed.**"As I recall that was after more than a week in a steamy jungle with another week following that on the *No Chance* which had a faulty sanisteamer. I think we were both more than eager for a hot bath."** He said chuckling. His hand gently tugged on the tie to the robe which was just enough to undo the bow while still leaving the robe closed.

### **Alicia** (2014-05-08 16:36:05)

With a smirk Jakira draws Wes towards her and decides it had been too long since they’d had a proper bath…

---

Dressed to the nines in a dark neon green floor length gown, Jakira looks across the table at Wes who while looking very striking in the suit ensemble she had picked out for him, looked rather uncomfortable. He was humoring her and she much appreciated it.
After the rather surprising encounter with the superstar, it doesn’t take Jakira long to realize who she was being compared to upon arriving to Coruscant. Jeri’ka seemed to take it in good humor, as any Zeltron would. They were both there to have a good time, and by the look of the superstar’s own escort had remarkable taste.
A good time was being had by all as she and Wes had worked their way through a couple appetizers and starting their second bottle of wine, or at least Jakira was. They were midway through their main course when the lights began to flicker and then turned off completely. The hair on the back of her neck begins to stand on end as the scene begins to play out in front of her.
Glancing at Wes, she doesn’t see much hope in fighting these jerks. However, the hold out blaster she has hidden under the fabric of her gown could give a different response.
*You’re never going to want to go out with me without your armor again, are you?* The question comes with a knowing internal sigh.
Not possessing much in the way of valuables on her person (after all, a Zeltron doesn’t need jewels to astound another sentient) she doubts this discovery was going to please the Toydorians now circling around.

### **BWS2K** (2014-05-09 21:44:16)

The Toydarians are slow but methodical in their efforts. Already, the small sacks they carry are nearly full. While Wes and Jakira strategize, they are approaced by one of the thugs. Raising his blaster and pointing it in Jakira's face, he addresses them both: "**Okay, Missie. Let's see whatchya got, eh? Heh! And no fast moves there, big guy!**"
Before either has the chance to react, there's a commotion from across the room. It's unclear exactly what's happening at first because of the emergency lighting. A few blaster shots, some screaming, and suddenly the lead thug shouts over the crowd: "**Heyah, now maybe you see we meanah *bizahness*, eh?**"
The thug's attention momentarily on something else, if Wes or Jakira intend to act, now's the time. An all too familiar sight can be seen as the patrons slowly back away from the knot of confusion: It's the darkened form of a large bodyguard cradling Jerik'a gently in his arms. She's clearly wounded bad, judging by both the stains on the carpet and the model of blaster currently hovering only *inches* from Jakira's face - assuming all the Toydarians were packing the same heat. A trained eye, coupled with honed sensitivity to the Force, assures Jakira that her look-alike isn't gone just yet, but it won't be long if something isn't done...
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Okay, layout: Imagine the hall as a large clock face you guys are just left of center, Jerik'a is at 9 o'clock (the thug that was just there is closer to 10 o'clock now), the thug with you in the center, a thug at 3 o'clock, one at 6 o'clock guarding the back and more or less keeping the kitchen staff in line, and the leader with two others at 12 o'clock. "Your" thug is currently looking towards the scene at 9 o'clock, giving you a possible circumstantial bonus (and remember the low lighting) to anything you might want to try and do with him. You're sitting across from each other, so he's sort of between you, if that makes sense, but his weapon is pointing at Jakira. Think that covers it well enough. Any questions, you know where I am.

### **Yogi** (2014-05-12 13:06:09)

One surprise upon arriving for dinner was running into Jerik'a. It now made sense to the Mandalorian as to why Jakira was getting the celebrity treatment since arriving. He thought the resemblance was startling similar as he watched her walk of with her own escort. Looking back to Jakira he smiled. **"Now I understand."** He said leaning leaning in closer to whisper in her ear. **"You're still the most striking woman in here."**
Wes sat across the table from his "date" as his thought drifted back to several hours ago. While shopping for dinner attire was probably one of his least favorite things to do, going with Jakira made it pleasurable. It made him smile seeing her enjoy trying on several different dresses and modeling them for him. He gave her the smile he only used for her as he reached up and ran his index finger along his collar in an attempt to fix something that wasn't out of place. Still he had to admit that they did indeed make a striking pair.
-------
Dinner as expected was excellent. It was turning out to be one of the more pleasurable evenings out he had ever had. The company he was keeping surely had something to do with that. The mood changed as a tremor in the Force foretold of trouble. When the light went out the tremor had become a full fledged warning as the party crashers entered the dining room. Trading glances with Jakira he gave her a nod as he counted at least seven intruders that he could see. If they had been armed it would have been a different scenario.
Through their telepathic bond he heard her exasperation about never leaving without his armor again. ***Don't worry Jakira. Another time will come. You can be assured that I will at least have my lightsaber with me.*** Through the Force he reached out to her and let his confidence bolster her. ***I count seven that I can see.*** He thought as the Toydarians were making their way around the room.
With a sense of calmness that belayed the urgency of the situation Wes reached out with his Force senses to take in the room as he watched all those around them.
Wes watched as the thug approached their table. With blaster in hand he sticks it in Jakira's face. The action caused the Mandalorian to twitch but he stood his ground as the thug warned him.
Neither of them had a chance to do anything as a commotion from across the room began. Blaster shots followed by screams told them that maybe someone had acted only to have the results be disastrous. ***Ideas?*** He thought.

Jakira sits very still as she finds the Toydarian’s blaster in her face. Staring down the barrell she reinforces her nerves with the confidence Wes sends to her through their link. Her mind clear of panic she takes in the situation.
Drawing her attention from her predicament is the pained cry of the Zeltron celebrity, her life essence weakening with every passing moment. ***I have to get to her,*** Jakira says to herself, the thought picked up by Wes. The distraction might just prove to her benefit, as she focuses on the thug in front of her, willing the Force to warp his perceptions and make him more malleable to her influence.
In a low tone that would only travel as far as the Toydarain in front of her she pushes at his will. “**We don’t have anything of a value, but I’m a doctor. You’re going to let me help that woman.**”

Between the adrenaline and his honed combat skills, Wes' tapping into the Force is quite successful at confirming a number of things: The shadows are clear - all the *living* beings in the vicinity are now out here in the main dining hall. Tensions are indeed high, all the patrons are anxious about the robbery. Some are probably more nervous about someone in their position being compromised - wealth is something most present have in excess. Embarrassing situations or an exposed "secret" rendez-vous at an upscale establishment could bring a bureaucratic career to a swift end. The thugs, too, are understandably on edge. He doesn't detect anyone other than Jakira with an affinity for the Force.
For her part, the Zeltron seems to make some progress with her would-be assailant. He turns to her and makes like he's about to pull the trigger... but then the telltale signs of a successful Force manipulation begin to show. His eyes glaze over, his expression becomes a blank stare. Obviously trying to resist, it's only a moment before he repeats her words back in a monotone voice: "***You don't have anything of value… help that woman…***"
His gun is still raised, more or less, but only because he hasn't been told to lower it. The immediate danger seems to have passed - but they aren't out of the woods yet.

### **Alicia** (2014-05-14 16:31:09)

Jakira nods agreeably with the Toydorian, but the ruse would fall apart if his companions caught on he’d been mind tricked. Slowly she adds, “**Since this was all your idea, maybe you should take us to her.**” Subtly she looks over at Wes making sure the thug knew she meant for him to take them both over to the wounded Zeltron.
***This could go badly very quickly,*** she says to Wes through their link. ***I don’t think there’s much choice unless we leave Jerik’a to die.***

### **Yogi** (2014-05-14 17:01:47)

As he reached out with his senses Wes was able to find out that all the would be thugs were in the room. Tensions were high among many of the patrons. Which was to be expected especially after hearing, if not seeing despite the darkness, a woman get shot. He also felt Jakira reach out to the one that stood between them. His face remained stoic as he felt her impose her considerable will against his with favorable results.
He waited to see if her additional suggestion also worked.
He gave her a slight nod at her words. ***I know if they do anything else to harm another I will act.*** As always when faced with something serious his demeanor changed as did his presence in the Force. The shift from a dining room patron to the Mandalorian warrior that was always there emerged.
He waited for the thug to either escort them over or do something else. He hoped it was the first for the Toydarian’s sake.

Jakira's trickery continues to hold as the thug turns his empty gaze towards Wes and then motions for them both to begin making for Jerik'a, her sultry form still laying draped in the bodyguard's arms.
"***Let's go…***"
The trio seem to pass through the crowd easily enough, managing not to arouse any suspicions - for the time being. Jakira can tell a number of things immediately... and none of them bode well for her megastar doppelganger. The growing damp spot on the floor and her unusually pale skin tone indicate serious blood loss. Without serious treatment soon, she wasn't going to make it. The wound, though, was clean and clear of major organs. Jerik'a *could* go on to break a billion more hearts. Both Wes and Jakira can sense her life ebbing in the Force. For his part, the Mando is confident they have the appropriate amount of seconds in which to act before someone comes to investigate. Seconds... not minutes.
"**Hey there girl,**" she whispers faintly, "**I don't suppose your boy toy happens to be a *surgeon*?**"
A devilish smirk and flirty wink, despite the circumstances, is a credit to Zeltrons everywhere.
The Toydarian hovers nearby while his comrades continuing casing the restaurant.

They were escorted by the thug to the side of Jerik'a and her bodyguard. The latter was cradling her in his arms. His instincts were telling him that the poodoo was going to hit the fan any moment now. As they reached the two he removed his suit jacket and balled it up into a make shift pillow and knelt down with Jakira. He grinned at the megastars comment about him being the doctor. **"No miss,"** He says in a quiet tone. **"But she is and one of the best."**
As he spoke he motioned for the body guard to let her down gently so the jacket could be placed under her head. With out wasting any time since every second counted he placed a hand on the bodyguards shoulder. He spoke in a tone of experience that left nothing to question. **"Let her take care of her. You and I have other things to take of."** He held his gaze on the bodyguard just long enough to make sure he understood.
He placed a hand on Jakira's shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze and spoke softly. **"Keep your head down Cyar'ika. Do what you need to."** Standing up he rolled his shoulders that were now free of the slightly inhibiting jacket. Taking a step to his right he imposed himself between Jakira and the Toydarian.

Jakira puts on a brave face as she looks over her doppelganger's wounds. Holding her characteristic smile, she helps Wes to lower Jerik’a from her companions lap to the floor. She knew it wouldn’t matter what happened now if the thugs weren’t prevented from causing more mayhem. It was however possible once they got what they wanted and no one else decided to try something stupid they would be fine.
The latter thought she imparts to Wes, which she knew would be hard for the Mandalorian. So used to action, sometimes the hardest things to do was not to act.
As Wes begins to move away, she looks up at him, her hand pressed firmly over the gaping wound in the hope to provide them a few moments more. “**Cu’ulyc,**” she says to him, giving Wes her own warning. Turning her attention back to her patient, she shifts slightly making herself more comfortable on the floor.
There was very little time and without her usual gear, not even a medpac between them, there was only one path open to her. “You’re going to feel something.. odd. Whatever happens you need to stay quiet,” she relays to her patient in a quiet tone. Once a few years ago, Jakira had used the Force to heal her gravely wounded assistant. Litasha had taken her last breath when Jakira had pulled her from the brink and the effort had cost Jakira quite a bit of her strength to do so. While she doubted the toll would be as high as the first time, she had learned much about how to control her abilities, but she knew there was always a price to pay to heal someone with power of the Force.
Her hand over the wound, the Zeltron’s pretty face contorts into an expression of concentration. Willing her own life essence into the wound, she commands the wound to knit close from the inside out.

Picking up on her thoughts Wes simply nods as he stands between Jakira and the Toydarian. There was a time where he would have acted right when the would be robbers had entered the room. Further training and experience have taught him to be more patient. One thing the Arvendus had taught him was that impatience in battle can cost lives. While it was something that he had always known the warmaster had hammered that practice home.
Holding his hand level he let the other bodyguard to remain patient as he let a sense of calmness flow out from him to Jakira, her doppelganger and the body guard. ***Only if they force me to act Cyar'ika.***
As his thought finished he felt her concentration spike as she manipulated the Force to heal the woman. He knew Jakira could take care of herself but right now the two women were at their most vulnerable. He knew he would do everything he could to make sure neither came to harm.

### **BWS2K** (2014-05-16 16:23:53)

Jerik'a merely nods at Wes' words and closes her eyes, drifting slowly into oblivion. Her guard, however, holds the Mando's suggestive gaze and takes the meaning as only another warrior would. He sets his patron down gently, trusting Jakira to do her work, and looks back to Wes for guidance. Seeing him move closer to the Toydarian, he takes a look around the immediate area and then pats the inside of his shoulder knowingly - he's packing some heat and not afraid to use it.
Jerik'a's trip into The Great Beyond is suddenly halted by Jakira's Force skill. She gasps a deep breath, her eyes wide, but still remains semi-conscious. Whether she heard Jakira's words of advice or not isn't quite clear. The wound seals up suitably and the bleeding stops though. The internal damage will have to be addressed in detail later with the proper tools. Stable *is* better than dead.
The thug, now free from Jakira's immediate attention, begins to wander off towards another group who he hopes to relieve of as-yet un-liberated wealth. Weak-minded thugs were always easy targets for those strong in the Force, and even the Toydarian will is no match for Jakira's skill.
The other Toydarians are nearing their converging point at the door. Even the guard from the back starts to make his way forward. Wes can tell they have little in the way of military experience, the way they're approaching without clear coverage, but it doesn't take an elite soldier to pull a trigger, and they *were* eager to get away clean. The immediate dangers seems to be passing...

---

### **Yogi** (2014-05-22 12:18:58)

Wes watched as their thug moved along and began liberating others of their belongings. Several tense moments passed and they began converging near the door. While they lacked discipline their eagerness to be away clean was obvious. A robbery in a high class establishment took guts. To leave a body on the floor made it all the worse. They wanted out and the sooner the better.
He wanted to stop them but at what price. One was almost killed and even though he would have had help from the other bodyguard he doubted they could stop all of them before more innocents were injured or killed. He let out a sigh. Despite knowing that letting them get away was the safer route for all in the room it didn't set well with the Mandalorian. ***Looks like they maybe leaving without anymore bloodshed.*** He thought knowing Jakira, who was busy with her patient, would pick up on his thoughts.
He gave the bodyguard a quick look and a hand motion to stay. Despite the feeling that the danger was passing Wes kept an eye on the Toydarians.

### **Alicia** (2014-05-22 13:10:04)

Jakira slumps over the form of Jerik’a as her strength is transferred to her doppelganger. Just in time too as she began to sense the Zeltron slipping away. The sudden loss of Jakira’s own vitality leaves her feeling weak, but she knows the sensation will pass. The important news, as she looks at the once fatal wound and checks Jerik’a’s pulse, was the Zeltron superstar was alive.
Wes’s thoughts pull her to the present and she looks up and around for the first time in what seemed like ages. The sight was a relief. Wiping her hands on her already ruined dress, she sits back on her heels. ***Let’s hope.*** Tiredly, she adds, ***Can we not have a peaceful evening out?*** Her thoughts wander to their first night together on Solsis which had ended up with her hospital in ruins and two of his ship mates dead. It seemed if it wasn’t the Sith, there was something else preventing them from enjoying themselves.

### **BWS2K** (2014-05-24 20:52:27)

The intuitions of both Wes and Jakira prove true - the Toydarian thugs gather by the front entrance, exchange mumbled words with each other, and leave. The last to exit, the leader who addressed the crowded establishment at the beginning - which was only a few minutes ago - can't help but bid the ultra-rich adieu:
"**And-ah, now, so sorry to have distubed you, we'll ah-be going. Have yourselves ah pleasant evening, eh? Heh!**"
He fires a few blaster rounds into the ceiling and hovers out the main entrance.
It takes a few seconds for some of the patrons to fully realize what has just happened. Not that petty thievery in itself was terribly upsetting, but the notion of a spoiled dinner at a place like *Rolo's* is even worse (and likely more expensive). The crowd mulls around, finding their seats and checking personal com devices and trying to settle in and wait for order to be restored. Of course, it doesn't take more than a few moments for some to spot Jerik'a's slumped body on the ground with Jakira hovering over it. Rolo, spotting another possible crisis in his restaurant brewing, makes his way over and uses his trademark no-nonsense demeanor to return things to normal as soon as possible:
"**You there! Call the authorities at once! Such scum should be hunted down and *atomized* for this outrageous performance! And here, this woman is injured - see to it that emergency personnel are here in two minutes or your *head* on a *platter* will be the next dish I serve!**"
He goes on for some time, and it mostly works - waitstaff are able to contact the local police, who arrive in a few minutes. Among them is none other than Lt. Braddock. His eyes go wide as he spots Jerik'a *and* Jakira, now realizing his possible mis-step earlier. "**Well now, looks like maybe there's more *criminals* here than we realized…**" he mutters, giving Wes a sideways glance. He's nothing if not professional though, and things are soon back to normal. Power is restored, wounded Zeltrons carted off to medical facilities, and ovens cooking once more. One of the perks of being among the ultra-elite is never having to wait long for anything, including a return to normalcy.
The whole experience, from the arrival of the Toydarians to a regular *Rolo's* evening, takes no more than ten or twelve minutes. Wes and Jakira, her lovely dress stained with dark crimson streaks from are able to resume their meals - still warm - if they like. No good deed goes unnoticed... or so they *say*. Maybe there are exceptions to the rule.
Maybe.

### **Yogi** (2014-05-29 14:30:25)

It didn't take long after the Toydarians left for things to get interesting, not that being held up at a high profile place wasn't interesting.
As Rolo came out and started barking orders. Wes followed suit with the other bodyguard and knelt down next to Jakira. **"How is she doing?"** He could already tell that the famous Zeltron was out of danger but he asked more for her companions sake. Upon getting a response he looked at the other man. **"I am sorry. I felt that any actions by you or I would have caused more harm than good. If faced with real danger they could have just opened up on the other patrons here causing more of a mess. They were just thugs who would have panicked and shot up the place."**
Standing up when the authorities arrive Wes spots Lt. Braddock. He watched the man notice the look alike Zeltrons as he felt the mans presence in the Force alter slightly. Seeing the mans glance and hearing his muttered words all but affirms the Mandalorians thoughts. Biting back a response he offered his hand to Jakira, who had just gave some of her life force to Jerik'a, helping the now blood stained doctor to her feet. He then offered his non blood stained hand to the body guard. **"I'm Wes Del-Fin. Let us know how she's doing. Maybe we can stop by in a day or two after the Doctors have had their chance to check her out."** He made sure to swap comm codes with the man.
As the place quieted down with their departure he looked at Jakira. **"Well how would you like to proceed form here?"** He said grabbing a white napkin from the nearby table and offering it to her. He knew the dinner was practically ruined but the evening was still young.

### **Alicia** (2014-05-30 16:54:33)

A hint of tiredness escapes into her tone as she takes Wes’s hand gratefully and he helps her to her feet. The effects of the healing still leaving her feeling weak, she leans on him, gratefully for his support. “**The bleeding has stopped, but she’s lost a lot of blood and she may be bleeding internally.**”
Jakira continues observing her doppelganger, moving to sit in a nearby chair. As order is restored and security guard from earlier appears, she can’t help but to give him a sly smile. “**What ever do you mean?**” she dares to ask, more than ready to remind the security guard she had never claimed to be someone she wasn’t.
Looking up at Wes as he rejoins her after talking to the bodyguard she smiles tiredly up at him. Her evening has been all but ruined, and she wasn’t thrilled to spend the remainder in her blood soaked gown. “**Get dessert to go,**” she suggests, knowing there was plenty to distract them back at the hotel.

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-05-31 15:12:53)

The stoic bodyguard takes the news in stride, knowing a relationship any more than professional with his employer - even if it occasionally meant more intimate circumstances - could complicate things. He gives a silent nod of thanks to both Wes and Jakira, grateful to start escorting Jerik'a's stretcher out the front entrance. He pauses as Wes offers his hand:
"**Name's Val… but not really. You know how it is.**" He didn't get to be such a high-profile security escort by dropping his real name at every handshake. The two exchange comm codes and he moves to leave. "**I don't know about a visit, but I'm sure my employer will be more than grateful for all your help today. We'll be in touch.**" The man nods again and then jogs to catch up with the medical crew before they leave.
Braddock seems too involved with organizing the would-be chaos to engage in a conversation or even respond to Jakira's jibing question.
When things settle down, a waiter approaches apologetically and offers a chair: "**Mr. Rolo has asked that you allow this evening's meal to be at his expense - due, no doubt, to the, um, *unpleasantries* earlier. Won't you please stay for some dessert? The choco-caf-cake is a house specialty…!**"

With "Val" taking his leave to be with his employer the pair was approached by one of the waiters. The offer was a generous one. Compensation for the unpleasantries which included the dinner and desert. Wes looked at Jakira who sat in the chair looking normal. Well if normal could be called wearing a blood stained dress and having used some of her own self to heal her look a like. He used his own Force presence to bolster hers. A 'helping hand' so to speak.
**"What do you think Jakira. Would you prefer to get it to go?"**

### **Alicia** (2014-06-10 16:44:43)

“**I’d rather not continue to eat while I’m in this blood stained gown,**” Jakira says cooly indicating to the waiter the state of her dress. Even before Wes bolstered her with a share of mental energy she knew she would recover, but the delay in their departure wasn’t fostering a good mood. “**Doesn’t bode well for any sort of appetite. Many thanks to Mr. Rolo for his generosity, but I think we’ll be taking our meal and dessert to go.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-06-21 11:54:25)

"**Ah, very well then. I'm sure we'll be seeing you again…!**"
The waiter winks and scurries off to package up the remains of the meal, purposely maintaining eye contact rather than acknowledge the blood on Jakira's dress. A few other parties seem to have the same idea and it's longer than usual before the pair find themselves back at their room. Some patrons prefer discrete taxi service, others appear to have brought along a full entourage. Not surprisingly, the story of the evening is a "minor upset at local hotspot, *Rolo's*"... and that's pretty much all the Holonet dares to cover. Bad press is unwelcome press.
The intricately folded containers from dinner are designed to keep contents at optimal temperature to be eaten later. Aside from the two partial meals is a third box with two slices of confectionary delight slathered in chocolate and caramel. Clearly, Chef Rolo knows his desserts.
It's late in the evening, but not too late to be disturbed by a loud knock at the door...

Totes waited *forever* to make the Rolo reference, by the way. Cheers!

Grateful to be finally on their way, Jakira remains quiet as they take a taxi back to their hotel room. Making a beeline for the bedroom to take a bath and change out of her bloody dress, she dismisses the call at the door. “**You’ll get that, dear?**” she already knows the answer as she walks away leaving Wes to deal with who ever is on the other side.
Determined to enjoy the rest of her evening, the Zeltron lets the water in the tub run hot and gives her bloody dress no more mind as she strips it off and tosses it into the garbage.

The ride back to their hotel was quiet. Thankfully they were there in a short time. The evenings events coupled with a blood stained gown and jacket had put a stop to their evenings events. Looking at his chrono he verified that it was getting late though for a planet that never sleeps it doesn't say much.
Having not been in the room for more than a moment there was already a knock at the door. **"Sure."** He replied to her question knowing that she needed a moment to herself. Silently he hoped that the whole evening hadn't been ruined.
Arriving at the door he activated the security camera to see who was on the other side. It looked like one of the hotel staff members. An attractive violet skinned Twi'lek stood just outside the door. **"Just a moment."** He said into the intercom just before he retrieved his lightsaber and made his way back to the door. One could never be too careful especially after the evenings events. **"Yes, who is it?"** He spoke into the intercom once again.

### **BWS2K** (2014-07-10 20:22:11)

"**A message for you, sir. I had specific instructions to make sure it made it directly into your hands…**"
Wes opened the door halfway to a pleasantly surprised Twi'lek. Obviously, delivering secret messages to strong burly types wasn't an ordinary activity for her. She placed a small datacard in his palm and nodded goodbye. Watching her walk away, one could easily see why this area of the galaxy was preferable for discrete getaways...
Inside, should Wes decide to explore the contents of the datacard, he would find that it contains a copy of the latest album by Jerik'a - *Being Pink* - and a personalized holo-message. The Zeltron's face appears in the trademark ghostly blue glow, looking amazing despite the trauma that Wes and Jakira know she's been through:
"**My friends, thank you for help this evening. My doctors tell me I probably wouldn't be here if not for your quick thinking and skill with…** (she hesitates, recalling the odd sensations that accompanied Jakira's use of the Force to heal her wound) **…first aid. While I doubt I'll ever have the opportunity to return the favor, please feel free to contact me if there is *anything* I can do to repay you.**" Her smile fades for a moment and she winces, a reminder of the pain she must still be in. She continues in a more genuine tone, meaning every word. "**The galaxy's a big place - I *know*, I've been all *over* it - but finding good friends is a rare thing indeed. I hope I can count you among mine. Thank you, again, for saving my life. The following is my personal comm code - don't hesitate to give me a ring if you need anything.**" Her devilish grin reappears, and she finishes with "**Especially you, *boy toy*…**" and a familiar wink.
The holo-vid cuts out and the comm code displays, the digits hovering in the air to the tune of *Nautolan Love*, the hit single off the album.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Prize time! Okay. So you now have a **Helpful Ally** in Jerik'a, one of the most rich and famous faces in the known galaxy. Should you find yourself in need of pretty much anything, give her a ring and see what she can do to help out. Loosely following the rules on page 76 of *Scum and Villainy*, don't be a jerk and she'll help more than once - though she may find herself in need of some powerful friends from time to time too...
The rest of the evening is yours to RP, or not, and I can pick up the next day. Maybe with a lovely sunrise, maybe with an explosion... I guess we'll see! ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

**"Ok."** He responded through the intercom and opened the door a second later. The surprise on her face was evident as she placed the data card in his palm. **"Thank you."** He said as she turned to walk away. He looked at the data card and back to the disappearing form of the Twi'lek as he closed the door behind him.
Turning around to head towards the bedroom and the bath that Jakira was probably in. ***A data card was dropped off to us. be right there.*** He reached out his thought to his lover. Entering the room a few seconds later, after grabbing the portable holoplayer. **"I wonder whats on it?"** He said with a smile as slotted the card into the machine.
Looking up he noticed the bath was still filling, which was evident by the rising steam from the hot water. Coming closer to Jakira he accessed the cards contents and raised an eyebrow at seeing the copy of Jerik'a's latest album along with a vid file. Sitting on the side of the. Sitting on the side of the bath he angled the holoplayer so they both could see it. Watching the vid he smiled with the thought that she was going to be alright and that it looks like that they had made a valuable ally. Very rich friends were always a good thing. He raised an eyebrow and chuckled at her parting comment.
**"Well looks like something good came out of that encounter. She could be a good ally to have in reserve if we ever needed one."** He said as he looked to Jakira.

### **Alicia** (2014-07-11 16:45:07)

Jakira humms along to the music playing as she turns from the holo recording to the filled tub. Her mood rises considerably as she lowers herself into the steaming water. It had been a long time it seemed since she had a contact of such worth. Particularly one where they were genuinely appreciative of her gifts. “**Let’s hope we never get into a situation where we might need to call her on the favor.**”
Sighing in pleasure, she looks up at Wes over the lip of the tub. “**You know what would make this even better?**” Her face alight in pleasure she responds to her own question. “**That confectionary delight from Rolo’s and for you to join me.**”

### **Yogi** (2014-07-11 21:29:33)

Wes not only saw but felt her mood improve as the message finished. She was right though having a powerful ally to call upon was a good thing. Problem was if they need to cash in on the favor they were most likely in a tough spot.
He turned slightly to place the holo card reader on the ornate stand that was near the bath. When he turned back he saw her peering at him from just over the tubs edge. The look in her eye was one he had seen before. Coupled with the answer to her own question had him standing and making his way to the outer room where he food waited. **"That my dear is a request that will not have to be asked twice."** He said giving her a wink before disappearing through the door.

While the night is neither uneventful nor unexciting, nothing intrudes upon Wes and Jakira's time together. The morning is upon them sooner than would seem possible though, and they are greeted with the sound of sirens from outside. From the deck, they can see some commotion in a neighboring quarter. Dark smoke rises from several blown out windows near the bottom of a bright white complex. It has a few landing pads on the roof... and all the markings of a medical facility. Reports on the local Holonet confirm this, and a ticker scrolls across the bottom of the room terminal:
*Breaking news: Atmo General Hospital was the target of a terrorist raid last night, the latest in a series of recent attacks of hospitals and medical manufacturing plants. While the patients seem to have been left unharmed, all staff on the ground floors are missing. That area of the facility was mostly overnight quarters for personnel and the list of missing persons is expected to include a number of doctors, physicians, and specialists. Names have not yet been released…*

### **Yogi** (2014-07-14 12:43:16)

Slowly consciousness came to Wes as the sound of sirens whoosed by outside. The fact that he wasn't already out of bed investigating the sirens was testament to how comfortable and secure he felt at the moment. Taking in a deep breath and letting it out slowly he took in his surroundings. First and foremost he could feel the warm body of Jakira next to him. Her steady breathing told him that she was still sleeping. Upon reaching out with the Force he could also tell that the suite was empty except for them.
Slowly he extracted himself from her and the bed. It brought back a memory of the first night they spent together. It was back at her villa on Solsis. The Governor and his Imperial flunkies had decided to attack in the night. That night despite having just awakened from a hundred year hibernation a running firefight to escape *The Wheel* and an evening spent with Jakira he still woke up when spmething felt and or sounded wrong.
***Maybe I'm getting soft?*** He thought to himself but quickly dismissed the notion as he passed his robe that had been tossed on the floor by Jakira earlier this morning. Judging by the time they hadn't been sleeping for much more than five hours. Walking to the balcony he saw what had called the local emergency crews to the the neighboring quarter. Smoke billowed out from the now busted out windows. The fact that the explosion didn't wake him up bothered him slightly.
Moving back to the bed and sitting down he turned on the large holo terminal in the bedroom. It didn't take long to find out what was going on. Video and news crews were covering the incident. As the ticker scrolled he was able to find more info. Looking over at Jakira he smiled. She was still sleeping as he called her name to wake her up. He resisted to wake her up like he did that fateful night back in her villa. Kicking the bed was a rude way to wake anyone up. Then it was necessary. Now it wasn't.
**"Cyar'ika. Wake up. You're going to want to see this."** He gave her shoulder a small shake as well as a nudge through their Force connection. Given that this was a medical facility he figured she would want to know.

### **Alicia** (2014-07-15 12:12:21)

Having sensed Wes get up, Jakira lazily stayed in the bed. The sounds of sirens didn’t bother her. There was always something going on Coruscant and if they were in crisis then they would have known much sooner. The part of her mind that is awake finds amusement in Wes’ grumblings at the comfortable lifestyle she shared with him.
Starting to drift back into sleep, she’s awakened as Wes speaks her name and touches her shoulder. Shifting to rest on her back she answers him with a yawn and blinks at him, dismissing the last vestiges of sleep. Her eyes focus on the HoloNet report, and she squints to look at the brightly illuminated screen.
Her eyes grow wide as she realizes what she’s watching.“**Oh my…**” Sitting up to watch the report now fully awake, her eyes moving to follow the ticker displaying the live information. “**How awful. These raids are making it hard for anyone want to be a medical professional these days… No guarantee your facility won’t be hit and taken…**” Her gaze shifts to Wes. “**I wonder why they feel they must take the medical personnel and equipment. They must be after something specific.**”

### **Yogi** (2014-07-15 13:11:14)

**"It's possible but for what?"** He responded to her question. **"I haven't heard of any sort of military actions that would need medical personnel. Besides the military has its own medical corps to deal with things like that."**
He rummaged through some ideas as he continued to watch the news and the ticker that continued to scroll on the bottom of the screen. **"I wonder if these attacks have had any effect on out contacts. If whoever is doing the attacks is attacking medical facilities who is to say they wont go after smaller targets."** He paused as looked at her getting her attention. **"People like us."** He didn't have to say anything as he knew Jakira already knew what he was thinking as he stood and retrieved his comlink. He quickly sent a message to the ship, where Artie and the other droids were staying, asking how things were and if there was anything suspicious going on and to report back if anything happens.
**"Ok message sent to Artie. Shall we get in touch with our contacts here and see whats going on?"** He didn't have to say anything as she could feel through the Force. Despite their very enjoyable and gratifying alone time the chance that something might need to be dealt with offered its own sense of allure. Besides if people medical personnel and equipment were in danger there was that chance it could spill over to them.

### **Alicia** (2014-07-16 12:29:59)

Jakira knew there would be no deterring Wes from following through on his intention to reach out to their contacts. It was an inevitability they would have to get back to business. She’d just hoped it wouldn’t come about so quickly.
With no new developments listing on the news feed she turns away from it, falling flat on the plush bed, determined what was left of their bit of vacation. As they wait for their contact to respond, she does a mental inventory of what’s on the ship. Their stores had been depleted, and until they were resupplied she doubted they would make a very good target for these terrorists. Unless they wanted the ship itself, that is, and until they returned they’d miss out on taking the resident doctor.
“**Let’s not go back to the ship any time soon…**” she says as the last thought filters in. Perhaps they’d all be safer if they weren’t easily placed with the hospital ship.

### **BWS2K** (2014-07-16 18:34:50)

Artie's reply reaches Wes a while later: ***Spa was highly enjoyable… situation here is nominal… minor ship repairs and diagnostics being run… stores low…***

---

### **Yogi** (2014-07-17 12:26:37)

Artie was quick to respond to the message. He typed a quick response back response. *Alright. We want all of you to sit tight on the ship. We will make contact with out people soon. Keep the ship locked tight. We will check in regularly.* He followed up with a message to their contact here on Courscant. Letting them know that they were in the system and they would make contact again within twenty-four hours for a meet. Possibly sooner.
With the messages sent he turned to Jakira who was now laying back on the extravagant bed they had been sharing. Her statement about not going back to the ship made sense as he picked up on her thoughts. Moving back to the bed he sat down and shuffled closer to her. Finally laying next to her with his head propped up on his hand. **"Agreed. I imagine we could stay here for the time being."** He gave her a smile as he knew she wanted their mini-vacation to last a bit longer. **"I sent a message to our contact here letting them know that we'd be in touch within twenty-four hours. This way we can enjoy another day if we want. What do you think?"** He said as he traced a circle on her bare shoulder.

### **BWS2K** (2014-07-20 10:06:55)

A few hours after Wes' message had been sent, the following came back:
*General Notice to all relief personnel - assistance on Coruscant needed. Short-term staffing opportunities, orbital and sub-orbital transportation demands. Standard pay rate plus fuel costs.*
That was the bureaucratic way of stating the obvious... and only the obvious. Still, moments after its reception, a more personalized message came through of a holovid:
"**Del-Fin, Jakira, greetings.**" It was a man they'd never seen before, but he clearly knew them. The codes checked out anyway. "**I got your message. What we really need is someone to get to the bottom of all these attacks… abductions… whatever. I figure you've got a fair chance of doing that. We've sent an agent along to fill you in on the details, but I'm sure it won't be a long conversation. He'll be waiting for you at…**" The floating blue head looks away for a moment and the sound of typing can be heard, then: "**Hmm. Just outside the Atmo General Hospital. That's the place that was just attacked a while ago, so maybe it's the best place to start. Just be careful. Good luck.**"
The hologram fades out, leaving Wes and Jakira with another date - this time, there's little chance of a complimentary meal.

Jakira watches the recording over Wes' shoulder. "**Of course, they'd want *us* to look into this wouldn't they.**" She frowns as her gaze goes to their window. "**At least we won't have to go fa, but it would have been helpful to know who we're looking for. The hospital is going to be swarming with personnel investigating the attack.**" Putting her hand on her hip, the folds of her tastefully placed robe shifting with the movement. "**Perhaps it would be prudent to go back to the ship first and get the rest of our gear?**" Her thoughts shift to the chest she'd stored her armor in collecting dust on the ship.

---

### **Yogi** (2014-08-12 12:07:02)

Wes raised an eyebrow at her mention of grabbing her gear at the ship. It had been a while since she had worm her armor. With them no longer on the run from the Sith the need wasn't there. Still there was this whole thing with hospitals and support personnel getting attacked. **"We can do that. Having your armor would be safer since we don't know what we are dealing with."**
He walked to the food cart that had brought them their breakfast and poured himself a drink of the exotic juice. **"As far as who we are looking for I have a feeling that they will know us by sight. Mandalorian armor isn't exactly used for blending in. Normally."** He finished setting the glass down and walked to where she still stood. The hand on her hip almost seemed a testament as to not wanting to leave the plush setting on the suite. His arms encircle her waist as they came together. Finally resting at the small of her back. **"I hate to say it but I think our little stint of R&R has come to an end."**

### **Alicia** (2014-08-12 12:30:19)

The Zeltron woman sighs heavily, coming to terms with the knowledge Wes was right. “**Short… but sweet**, she acknowledges, a smile curving her features. Standing on her toes she gives him a lingering kiss. “This won’t be our last try at R&R if I have anything to say about it.”
Stepping away from him, she heads towards the bedroom to change into her clothes. It doesn’t take her long and with their slim number of possessions to collect she’s quickly ready to leave. Her fingers comb through her as she stands waiting for Wes to retrieve the rest of his armor.
“**To the ship then, for a quick stopover before heading to the hospital. We can at least see to some better security on the ship before we head out again.**”

---

### **Yogi** (2014-08-12 13:16:23)

Despite the days in close contact her lingering kiss leaves him wanting more. He watched her move away as her words finally sank in. ***Here's hoping*** he thought knowing she would pick up on it.
Letting out a sigh as she disappeared into the bedroom he made for his slim number of possessions. Putting on his armor came as naturally as most put on clothes. When Jakira emerged from the bedroom he only had to keep her waiting for a moment or two. **Artie should have things pretty secure but it wont hurt to double check."**
He gave her a wink before slipping on the helmet and bringing up the optics package. With a quick check of the charge on his carbine and that his lightsaber was secure he gave her a nod. **"Ready when you are."**

### **BWS2K** (2014-08-12 14:59:54)

Wes and Jakira head to Atmo General Hospital by way of the docking bay where the Sojourn was waiting, just brimming with what could quite possibly be the most relaxed assortment of droids ever seen. Sure, there were duties to be performed, but without their masters onboard Artie and the others were able to work at their own, more efficient, pace. Clean gleaming chassis and vocabulators unfettered by the buzzing of overdue maintenance were the sights and sounds that greeted the pair as they grabbed their gear and departed again to meet up with the contact. Truth be told, the droids didn't mind at all.
Atmo General Hospital looked less like a medical facility on the galaxy's central ecumenopolis and more like a sight out of the battlegrounds of some fringe planet. Except for the hundreds of people surrounding, climbing, inspecting, watching and digging, it may have been just that. The flashing blue and red lights of the authorities still blink incessantly but, thankfully, the sirens have been silenced. Cordons have been set up by the time Wes and Jakira arrive, and they are greeted by a no-nonsense Twi'lek:
"**Greetings Del-Fin, Jakira,**" she says curtly, "**I'm Rev. My orders were to assist you in whatever way I can…**" Rev's bright blue eyes turn back the burnt-out structure behind her as she adds: "**…but I don't know what help I'll be. I've spent the last couple years as pilot aboard a refugee transport, going wherever we were needed most. Never had a shortage of destinations.**"

Upon arriving at Atmo General Hospital Wes looked around. The area looked like a battle site than anything else. Step back a hundred years and this could have been a scene taken from just about anywhere the Vong invasion touched. Although this time it wasn't organic alien invaders it was someone from this galaxy.
Memories came back to him. Some he had forgotten about and some he done all he could do to forget. Many see the armor and expect an uncaring being hiding behind the helmet. Maybe some did hide behind it. He knew a few who fell into that mold. Thought he would never admit it not caring sometimes made it easier to deal with things. Yet somehow it always came back to bit him.
He took a breath and let it out in a controlled fashion. It was time to go to work.
Pointing with his carbine he indicated where a throng of personnel were working. **"Might as well try over there. If whomever we are supposed to meet knows what we look like we might as well get in the mix."**
It wasn't long till they were greeted by an attractive blue skinned Twi'lek named Rev. **"Well we are here to help with the investigation. Our contact said we would be meeting with an agent who could fill us in. Assuming that is you can you tell us what you know or have heard since being on site?"**

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-08-14 17:24:13)

"**Right,**" Rev replies, "**So let's see…**"
She pulls out a small datapad and begins reviewing it, mouthing the words silently for a few moments before looking back up at Wes: "**Assuming this is all the work of the same person or group or whatever, they've hit at least seven medical facilities in the last few months. Details of the attacks vary - some times it's more of an assault, like this one, but there were two thefts that weren't discovered until shift-change the next morning. The patients are never bothered but they never see anything suspicious either. All the staff just disappear without a trace. No one's been able to determine an entry point for the terrorists but what's more - we don't know where they *go*. Whoever it is, they leave with a hefty load of supplies and staff in tow. In this instance, it was just the folks on the first couple floors - the upper floors didn't even know what was going on until it was too late. The explosions and fire aren't ever lethal and the sprinklers usually put them out soon enough. My guess… it's a distraction of some kind. Anyway,**" she puts the datapad back in her jacket pocket, "**That's about it. I haven't had the chance to poke around too much yet but I've been told we have the necessary clearances. Just be careful - there are still patients in the building who might not appreciate us intruding. They've shut down the affected levels for the moment and moved everyone upstairs, so we should be alright there.**"

### **Yogi** (2014-09-10 13:20:00)

Wes listened as Rev ran down the details of at least seven attacks that spanned a few months. He was surprised that they hadn't heard about it before but considering where they had been it shouldn't have been. From the details the persons or group were pretty detailed in their planning. Apparently medical personnel and goods were needed by someone, somewhere.
Wes gave her another nod of his armored head. **"Alright lets check out the affected levels and see what we can find."** As They started walking he continued. **"I'd also like the info you have on the other attacks. Where, what and who was taken. Were all the attacks here on Courscant and were any of the personnel ever recovered?"**

### **Alicia** (2014-10-13 14:53:04)

Jakira pouts under her helmet as she processes the information their contact spouts at them. "**Is there a correlation with what's been takien? Could they be targeting particular specialties in medicine?**" she asks, adding onto the ideas Wes put forward. The whole affair seemed strange. Surely there were easier means to get a hold of medical equipment and personnel. Obviously they were going to great pains to not harm bystanders in their heists. A feat which would take a great deal of planning and potentially inside knowledge. "**We need to know everything the heists have had in common.**"

### **BWS2K** (2014-11-10 21:00:31)

"**Hmm…**" The Twi'lek browses her files a few moments more and then turns to Wes. She steps deftly under the cordon line and responds: "**The list is extensive in the respect that there are a lot of things that have been taken, but there aren't any discernible *patterns* that anyone has picked out. And yeah, it seems limited to Coruscant so far but no one that was taken has been found. To be fair,**" she concludes, glancing back and forth between Wes and Jakira both, "**I didn't get the impression that anybody else has looked into it beyond the usual bureaucratic nonsense. We're sort of the first. I think.**"
Working her way around some fallen rubble, Rev nods to Jakira and responds to her line of questioning as best she can: "**There's no correlation that I can see, but maybe a droid could do a better job at that sort of thing. Although…**" She stops walking and stares off into space for a few quiet moments. "**Maybe… maybe it's not a matter of what we *have* seen but what we *haven't* seen.** Like something we *should* have seen but haven't..."
Rev looks back down at Jakira. "**Or something like that. I don't know, I just fly ships mostly.**' She shrugs her shoulders and continues to make for the main entrance.

Tsking upon hearing no one had yet bothered to investigate the attacks of yet, Jakira follows the Twi'lek pilot beyond the taped lined crime scene and into the debris field beyond. It wan't hard for her to keep pace with the other woman, though her words to cause her to pause for a moment. Raising a delicate eyebrow beneath her helmet, Jakira reflects on Rev's words. "**Could you send a copy of the data back to our ship. We have a couple droids which could assist us in decimating the information better. The may be able to trace correlations we can't see right now.**" Following behind she gracefully steps around a pile of rubble.
*A matter of what we haven't seen…* she thinks knowing that Wes would pick up on the thought. Reaching out to the Force she allows the ebbs and tides to wash over her, wondering if perhaps the unseen could be found using more than just their eyes. While still maintaining her pace, she closes her eyes, allowing the Force to guide her steps.

### **Yogi** (2014-11-12 17:00:33)

Wes followed the two women past the tape that authorities had put up to keep the general populace out. He listened as Rev gave more details about the thefts. There wasn't much to go on. When Jakira asked for her to send the files to their ship he sent his own message to Artie.
<<<BEGIN TRANSMITION>> *Artie. You should be receiving a file or several files in a few minutes. I need you to go over them and look for any correlations that might be there. Also look for anything that might be missing in the reports. It might not be obvious. Seven facilities have been hit over the last few months and it look s like we're the first to actually be looking into it. Thanks* <<<END TRANSMITION>>>
*A matter of what we haven't seen…* He picked up on the thought that Jakira was having and felt her tap into the Force. He looked out over the blast area. This whole situation wasn't sitting right with him for some reason. Seven hits over the last few months and no one had put boots on the ground, so to speak, till now.
He looked back to the Twi'lek. **"Rev."** He called her nave to grab her attention since she was looking at her datapad. **"There's been seven recoded hit on medical facilities here on Courscant and we are the first to do an actual investigation? It seems a little to late in all honesty. Why not right after the first one? People were abducted and haven't been seen from since. And then it happens six more times and finally help is called in. Not to discredit our own abilities but I'm surprised a full investigative team isn't on this. Do you have any idea who on this bureaucratic chain stalled this and who finally got it going?"**  He knew he threw several questions at her and that she might not even know the answers. He was wondering if their contact within the GA government would have any of those answers.
He looked past her at the crime scene looking at the crime scene.

"**Well…,**" she begins, "**…I suppose there *could* have been others, I don't know. Shooting from the hip - maybe they ended up missing too? Kinda makes it all a little more interesting, if ya ask me.**" A simple shrug of the shoulders and it's clear Rev agrees with Wes' apparent disdain for the bureacracy involved.
Artie, for his part, acknowledges receipt of the data and promises to get on it right away.
As the trio begin to enter the structure proper, signs of damage everywhere, a faint sense of nagging pulls at them. It's as if there's something so obvious, so clear, that they haven't even considered it. Seven locations all attacked without leaving a trace, no evidence of who might be responsible and no leads on how it was all done. No ransom asked, no overt damage or injury and no discernible pattern to the gear that's been taken. Jakira steps on some loose paneling and nearly slips as it goes crashing into the sub-level below.
"**Careful. The upper levels have been cleared but I'm not sure if the teams have done much to secure this area. It's probably for the best, but it means all sorts of lovely surprises… like that one.**"
Rev's words suddenly take on an echo effect and time slows for both Wes and Jakira as their connection to the Living Force surges. All their battefield awareness and survival instincts combine with the hypersensitivity to what connects and binds all things together to form a singular shared revelation - both a question and answer to the present pursuit: *Where did the attackers come from? Where did the captives go?*
The moment passes in an instant, the sound of the fallen panel still reverberating through the corridors beneath them.

### **Yogi** (2014-11-13 22:53:23)

Wes nodded at Rev's guess about others before them. If that was the case he wondered if any information they may have found out had been passed on and if it would help them.
The site was a disaster. Debris was everywhere and he began to wonder how there were no casualties and no witnesses. That and the feeling that they were overlooking somethig so obvious it bothered him. **"We're overlooking something I just can't place a finger on it."** No more than a second had passed when Jakira slipped on some debris. The paneling shifted and fell into sub-level below.
The action seemed to slow time. Through his connection with Jakira he could feel that she was experiencing the same feeling. If the attackers hadn't come from topside that left only one other option. The feeling of time speeding back up normal came as quickly as it slowed. He looked at Jakira as the clanging panel fell deeper into the sub-level. Though it couldn't be seen by the two females that stood with him a smile spread across his face.
He stepped carefully to the hole the panel fell through and looked down. **"You're right Rev its a lovely surprise indeed. I have a sinking feeling I we are going to see a side of this planet many never see."** He pointed down through the hole with his carbine knowing his play on word wouldn't go unnoticed. **"Makes perfect sense. Attack from below. I cant tell you how many times we would launch an attack from below or lay traps underground back in the war."**

### **Alicia** (2014-11-18 13:18:28)

Dazed at the implication of the falling panel, Jakira lets out a silent string of curses as she first admonishes the builders for the poor structural integrity and then at the fact that the sublevels could have been used for the entry. Knowing they shared the same thought, she steps back to give Wes room as she pulls out a glowrod from her pouch. "**Time to see how far down this goes**," she says before tossing the activated light down into the dark depths.
Leaning over cautiously she watches as it falls into the hole and counts evenly how long before it hits the bottom. "**Rev, do you know of any other entrances into the sub-level to the hospital?**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-11-18 15:00:57)

Rev listens to Wes' assessment and her sudden realization is clear from the look on her face. She looks at Jakira's light clatter along the sides of the shaft and land several meters below. What structure can be seen is clearly aged, warped from years of misuse, and looks patched in some places with newer, though sub-par, supports.
"**Um… yeah, hang on…**" is her dazed response regarding the possibilities of alternate entrances. A few moments go by with only the sound of Rev's tapping on the datapad and the ambient noise of the crowds outside the building. Wes' comlink chirps with a message from Artie:
**<*Analysis of recieved data follows: 1) Most likely route of entry and exit, considering the amount of known missing persons and equipment, is either the rooftop with escape via highspeed craft with high-end stealth capabilities to avoid both electronic and visual detection or subterranean actions. The two may have been used in conjunction with each other and, in any case, suggests at least one contact inside the facilities to aid in planning. 2) The calculated correlation between the given data is negligible - the events may be random or there may be some critical data missing. An alternate possibility may be that the perpetrators were/are looking for something or someone and are operating on their own flawed or limited data. Combination of these two conclusions leads to the highest probability being a small group of operatives unwilling to draw so much attention to themselves as to be willing to cause unnecessary violence or leave much evidence at the crime scenes but who are motivated enough to continue to risk detection by repeated attempts to acquire whatever it is they are hoping to find. We all hope you are having a lovely time*.>**
Still tapping furiously at her datapad, with a look of consternation on her face, Rev finally sighs. "**Well it looks like there aren't any easy ways down there. They sealed off that section of the sub-level a few years back because of renovations. This entire wing isn't supposed to have a basement at all anymore.**"
She looks back and forth between the two companions: "**So… do I need to get some rope or what? I'm usually a few kilometers further up from ground-level, if you know what I mean.**"

### **Yogi** (2014-11-19 12:14:02)

The look of realization on Rev's face when it became apparent that they were gong to head below caused him to smile as Jakira picked up on his feelings. It looked pretty clear that this was going to be something that pilot wasn't used to. When REv began checking her datapad to answer Jakira's question he received a message from Artie. Reading it quickly he replied and and sent it off to Jakira and Rev so they could review it.
<<Artie can you see if you can find any trid video of the area that was attacked and see if there were possibly any escape craft used. It looks like we may be heading below the surface. Communications will most likely be limited. We'll stay in touch.>>
Finishing just in time for Rev's info on other possible sub-level entrances he gave a slight shrug as he looked back down into the opening and the area five meters below. Looking up to Jakira he smiled again. Though no one saw it Jakira could feel the fond remembrance of emotion from when they had first met. **"Well it would be like taking the stairs down into the archives will it? I have my utility belt so rope and a hook wont be a problem but I have a feeling that if we head down here we won't be coming back up the same place."** He paused for a second as he looked at Rev. **"We can get down another way. It's only five meters."** He knew he could jump down easily with aid of the Force. Then either he could use the force to bring them down or Jakira could do it for the two of them. Through their link she knew what he was thinking.

---

### **Alicia** (2014-11-19 21:51:40)

"**Yes… the archives,**" Jakira mutters as she looks down the hole once more. "**At least we HAD stairs.**" Thoughts of her lost home normally brought a stab of longing to her soul, but for once the distraction their adventure provided was enough that she could joke about it. "**Go ahead and secure the hook. we can at least leave the line dangling in case we do come back this way.**" After years of having to hide their Force sensitivity, she wasn't about to start now in blatant use of their abilities. Decked out in their armor was enough to discourage most trouble, keeping their powers a secret was a definite advantage to those brave, or stupid, enough to pick a fight.
" **We might need some more lights though. I only had that one glow rod.**"

---

### **Yogi** (2014-11-20 08:30:54)

With a nod of his armored head Wes started working on the line that they would leave in case they came back this way. **"That works. I also have a glow rod on me so that's one. We should be able to retrieve yours once we are down there."** He looked back down the opening and saw the erie shadows that were cast from Jakira's glow rod that had been tossed down just minutes ago.
Back to his task he had the cable and hook ready. The liquid solidified into the cable instantly when the outside air reached it. Looking up to Rev he indicated her pack. While not overtly large he was sure it carried some supplies. **"Do you have on you what you need for this, supplies and weapons? Who knows what we will find down there. From what I have heard it gets worse the farther into the sub city you go."**
He looked at Jakira as a thought ran through his mind. There was only one thing bothered him about going below. While much if not almost all of the structures above ground had been recovered from the Vong terraforming what existed far below ground not so much. The farther one went down the worse it got. Since awaking here in this time he had done some researching on the Vong. Some still lived in the deep sub-levels of the city planet. Meeting up with any while unlikely unnerved him slightly. It had been a hundred years since the Vong invasion. Most living today only remember it from tales or news vids. For the Mandalorian Knight that was not the case.
Taking a calming breath steadied himself. **"You ladies ready to go exploring."**

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-11-20 19:58:30)

Rev looks over at Wes with a somewhat skeptical expression on her blue face: "**Supplies and weapons? What… you mean like another glow rod? I have one of those, and this.**" She pulls a small sidearm out from under her vest. "**I'm hoping you two can make up the difference.**" The Twi'lek pilot fits her light onto the blaster and takes a wary look over the edge before looking to Jakira to volunteer...

---

### **Alicia** (2014-11-22 11:12:56)

The armored Zeltron looks at Rev with amusement, though the other woman would have no inkling of her expression. Casting her own gaze down into the hole she takes the rope and tugs on it, making sure that hook had been placed to support her weight. "**Let's go exploring,**" she says mimicking Wes's tone as she backs up toward the hole to repel down, though really she was trusting in the Force to see her safely down as she wasn't particularly strong and she was no climber.
Drawing on the link with Wes, she uses his knowledge on how to safely jump down using the Force as a buffer. Once ready she falls back into the hole, letting the rope slide through her gloved hands as she descends.

"**I suppose I'm next…**"
Rev grabs the rope, unsure of what to do with it at first. She mimics Jakira as best she can though and, while obviously not much of a climber, makes it to the landing without too many bumps and bruises. She steps clear of the line and throws some light in all directions: It's basically little more than an open room with open sockets and brackets where equipment was removed. It seems pretty stable, structurally-speaking, and there are two double doors off-center and opposite each other. The ladies are standing about equidistant from them. The fine layer of dust that covers most of the room appears to be disturbed recently between the two sets of doors and one of them - the one off to Rev's right - looks to be propped ajar.
"**Spooky.**" Rev tightens her grip on both her glowrod and sidearm and sticks close to Jakira.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So with your fancy helmets likely having some sort of compass, let's say it's a roughly square room, maybe ten meters along each wall, with two sets of double-doors that are opposite each other and not exactly in the center (if you drew a square and then drew a line one third of the way up, that's where the doors and disturbed dust would be, if that makes sense). The hole they are climbing down from is about in the center of the bottom wall in the square, which we'll call South from here out. So center South wall is the hole, Jakira and Rev, exits are East and West.

### **Yogi** (2014-11-24 08:00:46)

Watching Rev descend down the rope with little problem Wes got himself ready. Sitting down on the side of the hole he grabbed the rope with both armored hands and while not pretty shuffled off the ledge. Gripping the rope tightly he let it slip through his hands as he descended to the floor.
With an metallic thump his armored feet hit the floor. Instantly his carbine was in his hand again as he surveyed the room dialing up the low-light enhancement on his helmets optics package. **"Interesting. Should have been deserted down here. Obvious footprints. Can't be sure it was the attackers. Could just be the locale living under the surface."**
He looked at the two doors. **"Which way?"** After a second pause the Mandalorian answers his own question and walks to one of the western door.

### **Alicia** (2014-12-05 13:49:57)

Jakira looks around, bending down once Wes makes it to their level to retrieve the glow rod she had tossed. Wanting to conserve the powercell, she turns it off using the HUD in her helmet to compensate for the sudden lack of light. While he heads towards the closed door, she turns to pull on the rope they had just used to climb down on. With a bit of concentration she urges it to come lose and as she yanks steps back lest the hook land on her head. *Who knows how much more climbing we're going to be doing?* she comments pragmatically coiling the hardened liquid rope and storing the hook. Drawing her own pistol she heads for the eastern propped open door.
"**Someone's been this way,**" she indicates the propped open door and casts a dubious look at it, before carefully opening it more.

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-12-07 14:19:21)

"**The locale living under the surface… sure…**"
Rev assumes her best *I'm-a-soldier-like-them* posture and follows Wes through the Western doors. The warrior's keen eyes pick up something odd about the tracks in the dust below - footprints, but not ordinary ones. They seem animal-like. A big animal. Ahead of them is a long corridor, dark but for the light from the glowrods, that ends abruptly after about five meters. Laying on the floor at the end is what looks like the still body of a hospital staff, unconscious or worse...<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Meanwhile, headed in the opposite direction, Jakira first pushes, then pulls, the Eastern door wide enough to slip through. There are more tracks here in the dust, too many to be identified individually. She can hear voices, or something like voices, echoing down to her from the long passageway in front of her. A very faint light flickers at the far end as well, perhaps from a flame or failing light source. It looks at one time to have been the main hall of a ward, with several side rooms along either side. They're all boarded up or blocked now though - the only way to go is forward...

---

### **Alicia** (2014-12-11 18:29:39)

Jakira stops to listen for a moment, seeing if she can make out what's being said from this distance, that is if it is voices she's hearing. Moving slowly she starts to make her way down toward the light, her own light off and relying on her helmet to guide her way. *I hear something down this way. There's light too.*
Creeping cautiously, she tries to avoid attracting attention from whatever is at the end of the hallway.

Wes pushed through the Western doors into the corridor. He could sense Rev following close behind. He could sense that she was a bit uncomfortable down here and that she was out of her element.
He could feel Jakira reach out with the Force as he did the same. His intent was to see if there was any life ahead of him. It also served as a extra sense in the dark surroundings. It generally prevented nasty surprises. Guided by the light of the glow rod the corridor turned out to be rather short coming to an end quickly. Despite its short end there was something to be found, a body lying motionless. Wes pointed it out to Rev and advanced on it slowly as his carbine moved to cover it in case it was a trap.
He reached out with the Force (again) to see if the body held any life.
Jakira's thought came to him through their link. *Ok. We have a body here. Investigating it now.*
**"Cover me."** He said to Rev as he moved closer to check the body.

### **BWS2K** (2014-12-13 17:02:04)

As she creeps down the hall, Jakira can begin to make out words and phrases - a conversation is taking place, but there's background noise preventing her from discerning everything being said: "***That wasn't the plan… Not like this… We're running out of time…***"
The end of the hall is an intersection but the way to her left is blocked and, judging by the dust and scattered debris, either leads nowhere important or is totally impassable after a few meters anyway. To her right, however, is a small area - what may have been a reception area at one time, now cleared for other purposes. It's hard to make out details without revealing herself but, with the aid of the Force, she's able to detect at least three individuals all in an agitated state. They're huddled around some sort of portable generator - that's where the light is coming from, probably - arguing in hushed voices. Something else seems to be on the periphery of her senses, an unknown or unknowable... something. Jakira feels like she *should* know something but can't quite place the feeling...<div style="text-align: center;">
&mdash;
</div>

Wes approaches cautiously, despite Rev's obvious inexperience with the concept of cover fire, and is able to detect... nothing. The body has no presence in the Force and, thus, it is to Wes' surprise when it suddenly begins to crawl in his general direction. Only a meter or two exist between the two but it's close enough for Wes to get a good look. The person currently snarling at him is obviously malnourished and pale from lack of sun... and covered in spiny growths, even to the extent that some have broken through the tattered lab jacket hanging from his thin frame.
Rev lets out a scream, easily heard throughout the surrounding corridors, and shouts at Wes: "***AREWESHOOTINGTHATTHING?!***"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

See what I mean? Ya'll were talking about this, like, *months* ago and I really thought you were going to uncover the whole thing. Anyway. I hope we can avoid an official combat map but let me know if you need specifics. Consider, Alicia, that the folks down by Jakira's way don't know she's there but have definitely heard the scream. Rev's not really good at covert.

</details>

### **Yogi** (2014-12-14 08:58:48)

Moving to the right Wes angled himself so he wasn't in Rev's line of fire in case she fired her blaster. As once again he noticed she was completely out of her element. The body's presence was completely void if the Force. Feeling confident that the body was lifeless he closed the distance even more. Casting the light from his glowrod over the body he could see the spiny growths that covered its body. Some had even broken through the fabric of the lab coat which added to the eeriness of it all.
Something was nagging him in the recess of his mind though. **"Whatever it is its dead"** He said quietly to Rev. No sooner had he spoken the words the body jerked towards them and the body's disfigurations became clearer to the eye. His movement stopped suddenly as the grip on his carbine tightened as his eyes narrowed. He remembered a story told by a Jedi he had fought alongside with in the war. The Jedi could only sense a Vong by the void they presented in the Force. A hollowed feeling settled into his stomach as his emotions spiked. This being was alive but there was a void where its Force presence should have been.
*Vong!* He thought or maybe screamed in his head.
A split second later Rev was screaming about shooting the thing.
*Yes kill it!"* He thought again but didn't pull the trigger as he backed up a large step interposing himself between Rev and the Vong form that was now conscious.
Regaining some sort of composure and with reflexes honed from years of combat experience Wes flicked the carbine to stun and shot the Vong form.

Leaning in toward the edge of the wall as far as the Zeltron dared, she tries to get in a better position to catch more of what the three sentients were saying. The emptiness she felt, however, still nagged at her. Not knowing any better, she doesn’t pay much attention to it. At least not at first.
It’s not until Wes’s telepathic curse of ‘Vong’ does she get a sudden sense of dread as she whirls around in to face the direction of the emptiness. *There’s something here!* This something, she assumed was a Vong. She’d never met a Vong, though she’d heard plenty of stories from her time in the Coruscant medical facilities.
Knowing that Rev’s scream and the yelling from the hallway would attract attention and she soon be discovered, she raises her pistol and prepares to fire on anything which may prove to a threat.
