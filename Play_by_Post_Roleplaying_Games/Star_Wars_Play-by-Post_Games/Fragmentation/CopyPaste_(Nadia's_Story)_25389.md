# Copy/Paste (Nadia's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2013-08-25 11:16:12)

It's been nearly a month since her run-in with Imperial Commander Byron Chayse and Nadia Cloudspinner was enjoying a warm cup of morning tea and watching a spectacular Iruji sunrise. B3 was nearby, on standby, and most of the other townsfolk were still asleep. It was a good time to reflect on recent events, these early mornings, and there was plenty to think about.
Captain Steel and his droids had left the Star Destroyer *Vendetta* after a few days of repairs and liberating some supplies, taking any eager new recruits with them. The black and pink protocol droid gave her an odd look before boarding with the Captain, and then they were gone. The Imperials were all in holding cells, including Chayse, and the ship was brought out of the Sulu nebula slowly. Bearings were taken and many of the remaining craft were used to escape along whatever vectors the ex-inmates could agree on. Karn Okin - if that was truly his real name - had simply boarded his own ship, the *Moment's Notice*, and asked if Nadia wanted to continue their original supply run. It seemed like a fairly reasonable suggestion. Of course the Rangers had wanted a full briefing from them, and from B3's records of *Vendetta*'s systems, when they made it back. It was to be expected and it finally looked as if they were in the clear.
Until three days nights ago, when Nadia awoke in the middle of the night, panicked and sweating. She had dreamed - *or was it a vision?* - of terrible things, violence and death veiled into obscurity. The screams of comrades and enemies mingled together with the smells of burning flesh and the sounds of combat permeated her being. There wasn't anything clear about the dream, no discernible faces or places, but it was intensely emotional. Jaya had sent Kit to check on her that morning, having sensed something was amiss, but no conclusions could be reached. She continued to have the same dream each night since.
Nadia's comlink suddenly chirped an incoming text-only message. It was from Jedi Knight Joran Nor, a longtime friend of the family who had taken to searching out and rescuing remaining Jedi survivors. He'd had a lot of extra time on his hands lately. "*We may have a problem…*" The message was accompanied by some high-orbital sensor data with a lone object highlighted by Joran.
The readings indicated an inactive Imperial Probe Droid circling Iruji.

Hmm. Yeah, that seems good. At least it's not in the rain or aboard a crashing ship, right? ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

The young girl enjoyed mornings like these. The fall rains weren’t in full force yet, leaving the mornings with a clean smell that only comes after a good rain. The sky was clear at the moment, but there wouldn’t be any sunrise she could see. Still, sitting on the porch sipping tea in the quiet of the early morning she could almost forget about the dream which had been plaguing her the last several nights since her return to Iruji.
Her mother had surprisingly not been angry; as if she had resigned herself to the fact her daughter would no longer allow herself to be bound to the planet. There was almost a sadness, but her mother seemed to have taken the Jedi approach and had let go. There was no doubting, however, the relief Marina had shown when Nadia had stepped off the *Moment’s Notice* at their arrival. She listened with interest as the tale of how their adventure aboard the *Vendetta* and with Nadia’s encounter with Byron Chayse.
“**I doubt that will be the last we’ll see of him,**” Marina simply said. “**He’s a survivor.**”
Now there was just the dream.
Kit had listened patiently at the first telling, as her young friend had at first been reluctant to tell her. It was just a dream after all. With it returning every night, the young girl was beginning to dread sleep, but even the Force trance her mother had taught her wasn’t exempt. Which is why she had begun getting up early, and then when the others began to move about she headed toward the mountains. There was comfort up in that place.
She had heard the stories of how once the spirit of a dark Jedi had abducted her and several of the other children while they had picnicked in the Reaches. She had been young but the experience had hardly dampened the urge to keep going back. Once she had even scaled the cliff beside the waterfall. That was perhaps her favorite place.
The comm beep brought her back from her reverie, and she was slightly surprised to discover the message was from Joran. The images were even more puzzling and worrisome. *A probe? Where did that come from?* Sending back a reply she had received it, she immediately heads inside to tell Jaya and her mother. The rangers were going to have to be told. *Why would Joran contact me specifically?* she wonders briefly.

So did we bring the Vendetta back with us? Sorry for the huge delay. Finally got a mental break.

The conversation between the women didn't take too long and notifying the rangers was simple enough - there was no love on Iruji for the Empire. The response, however, was sure to be more complicated. A special council was assembled and a meeting held that evening. Joran Nor was included, as were Kit, Jaya, Marina, and Nadia, a few high-ranking rangers and a number of other people of importance. The holographic representation of Joran's findings hovered above the large table in the center of the meeting room.
After some obligatory introductions, Joran began: "**That, ladies and gentlemen, is an Imperial Probe Droid. I can't say with certainty how long it's been there but it's not sensor masked or anything - I'm sure someone would have noticed eventually. It's inactive, as best I can tell, so we're about as safe as we can be for the moment.**"
"**I say we blow it out of the sky. No good can come of leaving it alone!**" came a deep voice from across the table.
"**Oh, I don't believe anyone disagrees with you Lieutenant, but then what?**" Lieutenant B'Ri was a military man to the core, sometime lacking in subtlety what he made up for with courage. His was one of the founding members of the rangers, in fact, and they had always served with distinction in one way or another. "**It's unlikely to have just drifted here - someone *aimed* it at Iruji. The questions are who, when, and from where. The probe will probably have that information if we can salvage it without tripping its self-destruct mechanism - or accidentally activating a broadcast. What happens after that, well…**" he shrugged.
There was a wave of murmers among the council and the Jedi could sense the fears growing. This was a delicate situation indeed, calling for stealth and precision - and no small amount of courage. Had he been a few years younger, Joran wouldn't have hesitated to take his ship, the *Nova*, alongside the probe himself.
"**I know it's not a lot to go on, but I think the best thing to do, before anyone panics, is to hear some suggestions. We *all* want what's best for Iruji and our families.**"

Nadia had kept her comments to herself during the meeting, thrilled to have been included in the first place. Nadia eyes B’ri uncomfortably. As part of her apprenticeship period she had spend some time in the tutelage of various Rangers. She wasn’t quite sure what the gruff leader of the Rangers thought of her most recent ventures after her impromptu departure.
“**I think we should poke at it…” Nadia starts, then looks somewhat aghast at having spoken up, but now that she’d started she continues. “The probe is here for a reason and if someone out there knows we’re here they’ll likely just send another. Next time it may not be so easily dealt with.**”

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-09-14 21:32:38)

All eyes go to Nadia as she speaks. Her words find some footing, but not enough. One of the family heads, known for his particularly dense mind, began:
"**It's a valid point, to be sure, but I believe…**"
The matter was discussed from all angles and by the day's end it was clear a consensus would never be reached. The meeting was adjourned for the evening and began to break up, with small cliques forming of like-minded individuals to leave. Joran bowed out gracefully and wove through the crowd to Nadia's side. He motioned to a side corridor where they could speak privately.
"**That went about as expected. Kit's going up tonight in the Nova to take a look. I entertained the idea of stopping her of course, but I don't think I could've done that a decade ago, much less now. She's changed in a lot of ways, but, well… A Wookie is still a Wookie. I'd like you to go with her, if you can - just to *poke* at it."**"
Joran flashed a knowing grin, inwardly longing for his younger days when he would've leapt at the opportunity himself.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Sorry for the delay, hope all is well! I feel like a chat would be appropriate some time to establish the more conversational stuff but I don't think either of us have much time for that anymore. I officially have students in the classroom this week, so I'm sure to be in bed by eight just about every night. Joran and I are both getting old. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

### **Alicia** (2013-09-18 17:00:07)

It’s with some frustration that Nadia leaves the meeting. *Committees… All that talk and nothing was decided on what to do.* Her mood was sour up until Joran approached her.
Nadia gives Joran a knowing smile, glad someone was going to be taking things into their own hands. “**I’d be happy to,**” Nadia says. At least now she wouldn’t have to try to convince Karn or Joran into letting her borrow their ship and she’d have some company. It was probably best to be taking the Nova anyways. Even with it being an older ship it had some remarkable sensor bafflers.
“**I’ll go ‘volunteer’ my help to her,**” Nadia says eager to be on her way, and unless Joran has more to say to her so goes to meet up with the Wookie.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Grats on the students. I've been made primary tech for half our regions on top of my usual duties of learning how to work the databases and write up programs... fun stuff.

### **BWS2K** (2013-10-01 20:08:05)

Joran is soon swept up in more political conversation and shrugs to Nadia before turning away. Truth be told, he'd still rather face a legion of Stormtroopers than a room full of bureaucrats. Nadia's comm chirps with a text from Kit, ever eager to spend time with a friend: *See you soon!*
She is, in fact, dressed for flight and waiting outside when Nadia arrives home.
"**Isn't it *exciting?!***"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I'm imagining Kit included the Star Wars Wookie equivilent of a winkie face after that text, but I'm not sure how I'd type it. I think I'll pause here just to give Nadia a chance to chat if you like. If not, I can get us up and in orbit in the next post. Wicked sorry it took so long, I think I'm... (gulp)... getting old. I'm in bed before ten most nights now. Tsk tsk.

### **Alicia** (2013-10-04 09:44:56)

Nadia smiles at her friend’s enthusiasm. Being just a few years older than her, Kit had been a quick friend growing up. She was like a furry big sister.
Leading the way into the house, she makes her way to the section Jaya had given her mother and by extension her. It doesn’t take long for Nadia to grab any of the supplies she would need. Including her own jumpsuit she had acquired from Karn during their venture.
“**We should probably leave before the Rangers catch on to what we’re up to. They’ll probably be distracted by all the bureaucratic nonsense.**
Nadia doesn’t mention her dream again, though in the back of her mind it screams at her. *Was the Force trying to warn me about this? Is it more dangerous than we think? A prelude to destruction?* She has to shake the thoughts of doubt out of her mind as she grins at Kit with excitement at the prospect of adventure.
Making a quick stop at the kitchen for some supplies other than ship rations, she bounds out behind Kit to Joran’s ship.

### **BWS2K** (2013-10-04 20:58:54)

The *Nova* was crammed full with every possible piece of rare and exotic ship's system when Marina was last aboard - many years ago. Exposed panels, numerous switches and consoles, and passages that can't be traversed at full height are all part of the onboard experience. Kitkatta is skilled in many things though, not least of which is machines, and she's managed to fit in just a couple more systems. She explains her latest "improvements" to Nadia as the pair make it past the bunkrooms to the navigation room.
"**…and I've got a few more schematics back in my cabin. I'm thinking we can probably squeeze a bit more power from the engines if we bypass some of the factory safety standard presets on the manifold couplings.**" Finally the hatch opens and the relatively uncluttered control stations appear in sight. Kit takes the pilot's seat and start punching in some pre-flight codes. Satisfied, she turns to face Nadia. All the appearance of her characteristic youthful naivete fades and she is suddenly more solemn, a tribute to her training under Joran and Jaya. The Force is not a youngling's plaything and Kit knows that full well. Her eyes are somehow older, and deeper, and heavy with a great burden:
"**Nadia, before we get started, tell me… the visions, you've seen them too, haven't you?**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Factory safety standard presets on the manifold couplings are for wimps anyway, right? So I seem to remember us talking about Kit back in the day, and about what sorts of things she'd pick up from Iruji regarding Force abilities - namely vision-ish things, and more passive mental things like that. I also seem to remember that Kit was a total bada**-in-the-making, so I figure she's probably picked up on some of this vision stuff too. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

</details>

### **Alicia** (2013-10-11 11:56:03)

Taking the co-pilot’s seat, Nadia glances over the console as it begins it’s pre-flight checks. She hadn’t had the opportunity yet to fly the *Nova*, and she hoped the opportunity might arise at some point during the venture. When Kit broaches her question, the younger girl doesn’t look up to respond right away.
Slowly she answers, “**They haven’t stopped.**” She remember when Kit had greeted her the morning after they had started, Jaya having sent Kit to her. Kit had managed to wheedle out the contents of the dream, though Nadia had thought it just the workings of her imaginings and as such, unimportant.
Confused now, Nadia looks up at Kit. “**Have you been having them too, then?**”****

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-10-11 16:31:51)

"**I have. Even Mrs. Jaya has had a few. We all seem to be sensing the same thing, though what it is exactly no one can tell. I wonder about this probe though…**" Kit's voice trails off as the implications run through her mind, and Nadia's. Knowing too much about the future can lead to complications, and unfounded fears, and any Jedi youngling knows enough to be cautious about such things. Still - the rise of the Empire has brought some very dark times indeed. All things must be considered in the light of survival.
The *Nova* chirps the all-ready and Kit wakes from her thoughts: "**Ah! Here we go!**"
A few minutes later and they break through the Iruji atmosphere and Kit brings up the coordinates for the Imperial probe. It still seems to be inactive and undamaged, but there's definitely someone in a vacc suit tethered to it. Kit looks at Nadia questioningly and then engages the visual cloaking systems. She pulls up as close as safety allows and mutters distractedly.
"**Now what's this about…?**"
They can see clearly through the canopy and on the viewscreens that someone is very definitely trying to pry open a panel on the probe.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Ah, so maybe I forgot that Nadia had told Kit about the dreams at all. My bad. Don't forget you've probably got B3 with you. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2013-10-11 19:16:28)

“**That can’t be good…. Where did he come from anyways?**” Nadia doesn’t wait for an answer as she jumps up and heads toward the airlock. “**Keep us steady. I don’t like to think what will happen if that panel is messed with.**” Placing her helmet on her head as she ran, she makes sure her commlink is firmly in place as she starts the process to open the outer door. Checking her trajectory she pushes out toward the probe and her, so far, unsuspecting victim.

---

### **BWS2K** (2013-10-12 10:30:08)

Between Kit's piloting and the *Nova*'s stealth capability, they manage to avoid detection easily, and Nadia is lined up perfectly for a leap toward the stranger who is facing away and about twenty meters distant. She feels a brief tug as her body leaves the ship's artificial gravity and enters near-zero-gee, an odd sensation but not altogether unpleasant. Her unobstructed view allows her to spot a few floating tools near the humanoid and she can see the flash of some sort of electric welder. Whether it's managed to actually gain access to the probe or not isn't immediately clear.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Yeah, I'm going to need either an Athletics roll or a Dex roll, whichever you prefer, to make sure you end up where you want to be. DC is 20 and you didn't specify that you were tethered, so you're not. Feel free to freeform what happens next, depending on your roll, but leave the Big Reveal to me please.
Good times. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2013-10-14 12:04:39)

Nadia’s aim is straight in true as she flies towards her unsuspecting victim. Carefully putting her arms in front of her she makes herself as small as possible so as not to attract the guys attention and also to make it easier to grab the suited figure. Knowing full well she’s not tethered to anything, she trusts her aim and her ability to latch onto her victim or at least the probe.

### **BWS2K** (2013-10-18 20:03:11)

Nadia drifts silently closer until, right on target, she manages to grapple the stranger from behind. He's caught totally by surprise, dropping his welder and struggling to get a good view of his attacker. The restricted field of view of his vacsuit prevent him from doing so. The low-gravity allows Nadia to retain her momentum and the two are slowly pulled away from the probe, pulling the stranger's safety tether taught. The recoil sort of bounces them back and around so that the two are left entwined and dangling about a meter from the probe. Though she can't quite see a face, Nadia spots an Imperial ensignia on the right shoulder of the would-be mechanic... or saboteur.
"**You okay out there?**" comes Kit's voice over the comms.
There's clearly a panel half opened on the probe droid but any more than that will require a closer examination by Nadia.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Yeah, that's about right. I know what Ooru would do. ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)

### **Alicia** (2014-03-03 18:43:23)

"**Just… oof. Fine.**" Nadia starts as they get recoiled back toward the probe droid. "**Guy has an Imperial insignia on his suit.**" Knowing that it may not likely mean anything, she gives B3 direct line to the Probe the best she can from the hip compartment he liked to hang out in. "**Ok, B3.. Get to work. See what you can find out while I keep this guy busy.**" She keeps a tight hold on the guy, jerking him about as best she can to distract him from B3 heading over to the probe droid while keeping a firm hold on him lest he find a way to dislodge her. Last thing she wanted was to be drifting off into space.

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-07 23:51:12)

B3 chirps in the affirmative as Nadia and the stranger continue to grapple in the near-zero-gravity of high orbit just outside arm's length from the probe. His passive scans reveal little more than what is already known - Imperial origin, no measurable activity, signs of recent tampering. Kit, too, is hard at work running *Nova*'s sensors through every concievable channel. By all accounts, it's just an inert probe droid. All this happens in a few quick moments though, and the struggling pair begin to slowly wrap back around the derelict hunk of metal, spiraling in by the tether. Nadia can only hang on a bit loner without losing the upper hand.
<*B3 = Help?*>
The droid might not be able to do much, but with an entire planet below and the infinite above there's little room for finishing this fight second.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Yeah, so I'm going to need some sort of roll vs. a DC25 to do whatever Nadia wants with this space stranger. I have a number of thoughts about how to proceed but let's resolve that first. Sorry it took so long - crazy week at work. My equivalent of Parent-Teacher meetings. Cheers!

</details>

### **Alicia** (2014-03-08 13:35:30)

As they turn, Nadia's eyes grow wide at the sight of the planet below them. If things didn't go well, she'd be lost to space or to the forces of gravity. Neither were prospects she was eager to experience. Failure couldn't be an option. "**Kit, come place the ship as close as you can get.. I'm going to detach his tether and I'm going to need you to catch us. B3.. I want you to cut the tether when I say.**" She partly grunts her way through the order as the stranger struggles in her grasp. She wasn't however about to let the stranger get away and attempts to hold on while Kit gets into position.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Grapple** +7
***15*** <- [8] 1d20 + 7
So plan, if you want to push things forward depending... Once the Nova is lined up, going to push off on the stranger (granted I still have a hold on him) and while Nadia is heading back to the Nova, have B3 cut the line and she's going to use Move Object to bring him to the Nova as well.

</details>

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-08 16:24:51)

Nadia's efforts pay off, as Kit is able to pull in just a little closer and B3 performs as admirably as ever.
Sound doesn't travel through open space of course, and the stranger's radio isn't broadcasting, but if his body language is any indication his day has been decidedly ruined. The trio drift into the small space that serves as the *Nova*'s airlock and Kit meets them the moment pressurization occurs, bright green lightsaber drawn. The gravity kicks in and the Imperial flops to the floor in an uncomfortable-looking heap. While his helmet doesn't allow immediate identification, he looks about ready to tear it off and chuck it at the nearest living thing. The suit, bulky and not really designed for righting oneself from the deck, does little to help his efforts. The motions more closely resemble a flailing child or fish than any Imperial agent.
"**Nice catch!**"
Kit's words are punctuated by a worried beep from B3 just entering the gravity field, his concern for his master and the general intensity of the situation is overwhelming.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

***11*** <- [7] 1d20 + 4
So I'll let you have the first move hear - speak to the guy, knock him out, etc. Sorry for the delay. ![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)

### **Alicia** (2014-03-08 22:05:45)

Having grabbed onto a support in the airlock as it pressurized she lands upright as the gravity envelops them. She can't help but release a sigh of relief as she finds solid ground beneath her. As Kit comes in, her lightsaber drawn, Nadia looks at her older friend and comments after removing her helmet, "**That… has to be one of the dumbest things I've done.**" Turning her attention to the flopping stranger, she goes to stand over him. Before he can get to it, she manages to unclasp his helmet, tearing free roughly. "**Now then… time for some answers.**" Nudging him with her foot she asks, "**Who are you and why the hell is that probe here?**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-09 12:25:07)

The stranger rights himself despite the kick and sits back on his knees. Staring up at Nadia is a young man not much older than her with a fierce countenance and who she vaguely recognizes from the council meeting earlier. It's one of Lieutenant B'Ri's officers, and he doesn't look like he's about to share much information with anyone... willingly.
"**Ensign Redar Beren, Iruji Rangers, Alpha Battalion. I already know who you are, *traitor*.**"
He glances at Kit's drawn weapon and comments with heavy sarcasm: "**I suppose you just plan to *negotiate* with the Imperials, right? Isn't that what you *Jedi* do?**"

### **Alicia** (2014-03-09 12:35:44)

Nadia's eyes grow wide as she realizes who it was they had dragged onto the Nova. The fact he had called her traitor seems to go over head as well as she realizes the implications of who she had dragged onto the ship. "**Whoa, whoa.. hold on. I think we've started on the wrong foot here. I thought you were Imperial,**" she says, pointing to the emblem blazoned on the suit. With a glance over at Kit she says. "**Looks like we weren't the only ones who decided to not wait for the committee. Lieutenant B'Ri must have sent him to.. what?**" she asks, looking back down at Beren. "**Poke around the probe?**"
"**Sorry about tackling you out there. We weren't expecting anyone else to be out here.**" Reaching down she offers to help the Ensign up, though she guessed his pride wouldn't allow him to accept. "**How did you even get out here?**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-09 18:46:03)

He draws back, refusing the help.
"**The insignia is insurance in case of being discovered by the real Imperials. *My* mission is none of *your* business…**" he looks down to check his chrono, "**…though we really ought to be going. It'll be clear what I was doing in a couple seconds.**"
The ship's klaxons begin blaring and Kit gives a quick curse under her breath before shooting Ensign Beren a death glare and running off to the cockpit. "***Everyonehangontosomething…!***" she shouts, weaving her way deftly through the cluttered corridors. The crpytic warning and Kit's concerns are immediately answered as a blinding flash of light, dimmed only by the ship's tinted ports on the airlock, momentarily fills space. The *Nova* rocks suddenly as Kit throws maximum power to maneuvering and rolls to avoid the worst of the blast.
"**Mission accomplished,**" mutters Redar.
The sense of dread that both the Force sensitives feel, however, indicates things are only just beginning...
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Hmm. Yeah. That's good. Tag!

### **Alicia** (2014-03-09 19:06:04)

"**And *I'm* the traitor?! If you brought the Empire here then…** "Nadia grabs hold of the support once more as Kit sharply maneuvers the Nova. The memories of her vision returning, the dread she senses with the newest arrivals. It was almost turning into more than the young girl felt she could handle. "**You may very well have killed us all,**" she says evenly with great sadness. Leaning against the strut, she closes her eyes trying to force out flashes of the vision. "**Kit, what's going on out there?**"

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-09 21:41:11)

"**Well. The good news is the probe is gone, thanks to our new *best friend*. The bad news is there may have been a burst transmission right as we arrived. I'm reviewing the data now, but it seems to have been broadcast on a line-of-sight path. It'll take me a couple minutes to compute exactly where that might have been. Standby.**"
Nadia knows enough about communications tech to understand what that could mean. If it's true, and the probe somehow got a message out, and *if* someone was actually listening, they could be in a *lot* of trouble. Redar's change of heart is immediate: "**A *transmission?* But I… I thought it was inactive? Derelict? Isn't that what they said - that it wasn't working anymore?**"
Before anyone can answer, Nadia's comlink comes alive with the voice of Jedi Knight Joran Nor: "**Well, to be honest, I'm surprised it took you two *this* long to blow something up - but Nadia, what's going *on*? There's a lot of excited people down here…**"

### **Alicia** (2014-03-10 11:09:32)

Nadia is about to answer the misled Ranger when Joran’s comm pushes through. “**Things are about to get more *exciting*… We think the probe sent out a transmission on a line of sight. Kit is tracking it now to see if anyone is listening. But…** ” A pained expression crosses her features as she looks out the port hole at the planet below. “**We may want to start evacuating.**”
That was going to go over well, she knew. It was likely a new committee was going to be created just to argue the points of evacuation. Even with a warning, they were running out of time. Someone out there was likely listening and soon their isolated paradise was about to be discovered.
She mutes the comm and looks at Redar. The ranger had to be cut some slack, after all, Nadia and Kit had come up here to poke at the probe. Though the smart thing would have been to make sure the damn thing wasn’t about to send out any communications before it blew up. “**Looks like Lieutenant B’Ri got his wish… the probe got blown out of the sky. Hopefully nothing else comes following.**” With the feeling of dread still encompassing her, she heads to the cockpit leaving Ensign Redar to continue flopping about on the deck.

B3 zips along behind Nadia, weaving his own path up to the pilot's station. She finds Kit working furiously at half a dozen displays and small terminals, all set to calculate possible destinations of the probe's final transmission. "**If we can get a fix on a location maybe we can get there and intercept it somehow, or prevent the recipient from passing it along…**" she says to Nadia, not taking her eyes off the displays.
In the back of the ship, still in the airlock but sitting up now, Ensign Redar Beren of the Iruji Rangers re-thinks what he's been told of the Jedi. Without hiding their combat abilities, it had been generally believed - at least in his battalion - that they were somewhat free radicals; loose cannons not to be depended upon in a pinch. In this regard, it may simply be that his age is against him, as most of the senior residents on Iruji remember the Order fondly. Great when slashing through enemies with a lightsaber but not generally believed by Redar to have been of any real use otherwise. The current situation was providing ample opportunity to learn differently for the young officer.
On the planet below, authorities had already been alerted and reconvened. What little new information there was to be known was analyzed and over-analyzed. Speculations abounded but little could be done in time - even planetary evacuation could take days for some of the more remote areas. Still, nothing stopped the more affluent and less committed from taking to their own private ships, citing previous engagements, if any excuse was even given. "**Nobody is ever anxious to garner the attention of the Empire,**" stated Joran Nor, addressing the Council, "**But there are still ways to navigate such situations. I ask only your patience and trust, and cooperation, that we might all work *together* to face whatever these next hours may bring.**"
His words do not fall on deaf ears, neither do they fall on complacent ones. Emergency preparations are begun within the hour and those who can find time to sleep, try to. Redar composes and sends his own report on the situation, only to be drawn into a rather indelicate conversation about his ability to work stealthily and his pending review. Joran meditates, seeking peace and hoping that isn't a futile gesture.
As the minutes tick by, Kitkkata's furry fingers dance across keypads ever faster, closing the noose about the transmission's destination. There's as much tension in the cockpit as in the Council Chambers. Finally, the *Nova*'s systems chirp a result:
"**Got it. Looks like… Felucia?**" The wookie turns a confused face to Nadia - Felucia was, technically, an Imperial planet, but it was reported to be little more than a slaver outpost for the Empire. Lush, tropical, dense with life and native dangers... but not exactly Coruscant.

Nadia looks up from poking about on the console she had been using to keep up to date on the happenings on the planet. Fortunately Joran and Marina had been keeping them up to date as they remained in position to track the probe’s final transmission. She nods absently to Ensign Redar when he makes his appearance to send his report. Knowing the Rangers it was likely to be ill received and for a moment she felt sorry for him. Only for the moment for her to remember it was due to his complacency her home world was now having to evacuate.
Brought out her reverie Nadia’s attention snaps to Kit. Not sure she heard the Wookie right she repeats, “**Felucia?…. Why would an Imperial probe be sent from there?**” Checking over the readings she doesn't doubt Kit knew what she was doing when she traced the signal, but the origins was a bit hard to believe.
Opening up the channel to her mother and Joran, she informs them of the most recent development. “**I think it’s best if we go investigate… See what sort of threat sent this probe here.**” Looking over at Kit, she adds as an after thought. “**Not sure how much time we have, but we can dip down to pick up any extra hands….**”

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-14 21:02:50)

"**Well… if it's as bad as it sounds, we don't really have much time,**" replies Joran. "**Best to check it out. Let us know as soon as you find out anything.**" Some final farewells and well-wishes from both Joran and Marina, and Kit preps the navicomputer for the imminent trip. *Nova*'s modified engines can make the trip safely in just under two hours - time enough for reflection on just what might be waiting for them.
Meanwhile, with most of the ship's stealth features still active, the crew remains unseen as dozens of smaller craft can actually be seen leaving the planet's surface and breaking atmosphere. "**That's the problem with running from the Empire,**" Kit muses darkly, "**Eventually you run out of places to hide.**"
She would know.
The starfield blurs to bright lines as the *Nova* makes the jump to lightspeed in silence.

I think I want to stop there just to allow time for some further chatting if you like, either with Kit or with Redar, or B3, or whatever. If you're up for it and you're interested, we can try a chat like we did with Joran back in the day. Otherwise go with some interior monologue or something and I'll get you to Felucia in my next post. Cheers!

### **Alicia** (2014-03-15 20:31:41)

Nadia looks out at the ships evacuating the planet. "Hopefully it won't be for long."
Nadia: "With any luck, we'll be able to locate whoever the probe sent its message to before they have a chance to relay out Iruji's coordinates."
Redar Beren enters the cockpit cautiously, unsure whether his status aboard is closer to "passenger" or "prisoner".
Redar Beren: "So... where we headed?"
Kitkkata glares at him, making her thoughts on his presence known.
Nadia: "Felucia... that's where Kit managed to trace the signal."
Nadia has long gotten over what Redar has done. There was no point in holding a grudge when there were better things to be wasting her energy on.
Redar Beren: "...Felucia? Don't know that I've heard of it. Of course, this is my first time away from home." His attempt at humor with Nadia is awkward, but maybe it'll work.
Nadia: "Not a surprise... most Rangers tend to stay close to home," she looks over the panel as she talks. Checking over the hyperspace coordinates in the navicomputer.
Nadia glances over at Kit with a conspiratorial smile. "Maybe that's why I was never going to cut it as a Ranger... Wanderlust got in the way."
Kitkkata isn't surprised to hear Redar's even more of a rookie than she thought at first.
Kitkkata merely shrugs and raises a finger towards the rookie Ranger:
Kitkkata: "Well, I don't care if you're the flippin' President of the whole Ranger Corps - you're in it now, and you better pay attention. We only have one ship and unless you have another one in the ugly Imp-suit I suggest you try not to blow this one up."
Redar Beren: Hands open in a mock gesture of surrender, though perhaps less "mock" than expected, Redar accepts his position as less-than-in-charge of this mission, whatever it turns out to be. "Hey, you got it."
"Speaking of - you mentioned Felucia. Do we have any idea what we're going to do when we get there? Not that I'm doubting your abilities or anything," he casts a sideways glance at Kit, who's definitely still trying to look busy at her console, "...but if there's really Imperials, I mean, that could be bad, right?"
"Can't say I've ever really seen them around Iruji..."
Nadia finishes her check of the route, nodding in satisfaction "Would be very bad. Can't say there's much of a choice though but to find out what the probe sent out. And to who..." She looks at Kit, knowing she'd probably be speaking for the both of them. "When we get there, we'll have to find answers."
Nadia stands and stretches. "We have a few hours before we reach Felucia. Let me show you around and where you can stay out of Kit's way."
Redar Beren: "I see." Feeling a little more comfortable that he won't be travelling in the airlock for the next couple hours, Redar follows Nadia and continues: "So you've obviously done this before. Tangled with the Empire I mean. What's it like? Being stuck on Iruji, we only get stories from pilots and what we can manage to catch on the Holonet hacks. Is it all as bad as they say?"
Nadia shrugs as she leads him through a short tour of the ship and showing him one of the rooms furthest from Kit. "They're just people like you and I... As long as you remain inconspicuous and are human they'll leave you alone for the most part."
Redar Beren: "Hmm." Redar glances around the very cramped bunkroom. The Nova is a fantastic ship when dodging bad guys or smuggling outlaws, but it's no five-star cruiseliner. He quickly steps out of his bulky spacesuit, revealing his standard issue fatigues. The olive drab and green camouflage are ubiquitous the galaxy over for military personnel, not matter the service. "I know I just met you and all, but inconspicuous isn't a word I'd use to describe anyone I've seen on this ship so far."
Nadia can't help but laugh at that. "We know how to blend in when we need to. Sort of necessary for survival." Growing quiet for a long moment she decides to remind Redar of an important point. "I hope I don't need to remind you, but the Empire is hunting and exterminating Force users... Most of the population of our paradise world would be killed or... worse."
Redar Beren had heard something to that effect. The Force was something mysterious even to those that knew it well, but to ordinary folks just trying to make a living, well, it was hard to not get suspicious sometimes. Of course, the Empire wasn't exactly trustworthy either.
Redar Beren: "Yeah. I know about what happened with the clones, Order 66. I think everyone does, at this point. Don't worry, I'm new to this but I'm not about to bail on my ticket home." He chuckles, knowing that where they may not have much in common each other, surely he and Nadia, and even Kit, can all find common ground when it comes to wanting to protect Iruji.
Redar Beren: "So, um, if you don't mind... what's that like exactly? The Force - is it, like, magic or something? Why are you being exterminated?" Redar stretches a bit and folds up the suit, stowing it on the bunk.
Nadia thinks about it for a moment. "It's more... a skill. Everyone has the Force inside of them, but not everyone has the ability to use it. As to why the Empire wants us dead," she shrugs. "I guess more than anything maybe they're afraid... People can be rather desperate when they're afraid of things they don't understand. It's something I asked my mother all the time..."
Redar Beren considers Nadia's response for a quiet moment. Certainly he can understand being afraid of the unknown - even he had been quick to judge the Jedi. Now, he wasn't so sure.
Kitkkata comes over the ship's comms: "I've finished refining the transmission, if you want to have Bee take a look at it Nadia. I don't think it's as bad as it could've been but Binary's not my native tongue."
Nadia hits one of the panels to respond back. "I'll send B3 up right away. Thanks, Kit."

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-16 20:10:17)

B3 weaves his way to the cockpit where Kit awaits. Not that she was completely lost with the contents of the transmission but it never hurt to have a second pair of ears, even if they were just mechanical receptors. "**Hey, Bee. Take a listen and let me know what you think…**" She throws a switch on the main panel and the air fills with a static burst that clears to reveal the tell-tale sounds of high-frequency Binary. The whole set is looped, each cycle on lasting a few seconds, and Kit shuts it down after about a minute. "***Nova*'s computer managed to decrypt that without too much trouble, but… I'm not so certain on the translation. What'd you get…?**"
B3 chirps excitedly and links up with the main display. The screen rapidly fills with text:
*Emergency broadcast… passive scans reveal presence of sentient lifeforms…local communications tap complete…Jedi presence confirmed…one positive match to archive entry **Joran Nor**…one positive match to archive entry **Marina Numa**…*
The Wookie stares at the translation for a moment and nods slowly before turning to the little droid. "**So… who wants to tell Nadia?**" B3 gives a low whistle, clearly not volunteering himself. "**…thanks.**" Kit flips the comms back on and summons Nadia to the cockpit to share the good news...

### **Alicia** (2014-03-18 20:18:14)

Showing Redar the galley, Nadia takes the liberty of getting herself something to eat. With the comms summons she shrugs at Redar. “**Guess it didn’t take B3 long to decipher the message.**” Taking the rations she had pulled out with her, she heads toward the cockpit to see what her little remote droid had learned. Leaning against the bulkhead, it doesn’t take her long to sense Kit’s anxiety. “**What is it? What did the message say?**” she asks her curiosity peaked by the attitude on the bridge.

---

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-21 20:10:09)

Redar grabs a ration bar for himself and munches on it, following Nadia to the bridge once more. Despite the ultra-sophisticated technology all around them, the food selection was fairly mundane. Kit had her strengths and keeping kitchen wasn't really one of them. She points to the text still on the main display for the newcomers to see for themselves.
"**It… doesn't look good. It's not *necessarily* as bad as it sounds…**" Kit shrugs. She knows her words are more hollow hopes than certainty. In all liklihood, someone knew about Iruji now, and Marina and Joran by name.
A few tense moments go by, then: "**Well, at least it doesn't mention anything about *us*, right? I mean, we could still get the drop on… whoever it is on Felucia that gets this, right?**" Redar looks around the cabin for confirmation, but he doesn't find it from the Wookie or the droid. His eyes come to rest expectantly on Nadia...

### **Alicia** (2014-03-21 20:48:24)

The young woman stares at the translated message long after Kit tried to reconcile their situation. “**If they know Marina and Joran were on the planet, we should assume they know about the Nova as well,**” she looks over at Redar. “**The only surprise we have now is from the stealth capabilities of this ship.**”
Nodding to Kit, she leaves the cockpit and heads towards one of the bunk rooms finding it all of a sudden hard to be in the others’ company. Closing the door behind her, she leans against the door for a long moment. A giant pit in her stomach threatening to spill over.
Before the belief was they had been ambiguously targeted. Now if anyone had received the transmission, they had names and the information there were other Jedi on Iruji. Any hope of potentially returning if things went poorly was slim.
Taking a deep breath Nadia takes a meditative position on the cramp bunk and reaches out to the Force like she had been taught. There had to be some clarification on their vision. Some meaning. In truth she was not really expecting anything.

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-22 10:18:28)

B3 follows Nadia at a distance, setting himself down just outside her bunkroom and re-charging for what could prove to be a very long day ahead.
In the cockpit, awkward silence is eventually broken by Redar: "**Okay then, so is this ship good at hiding?**"
Kitkkata's early years were spent running from Imperial slavers through the great forests of Kashyyyk, until she was finally rescued by Jedi Knight Joran Nor. She'd been interested in machines ever since, often times spending long hours alone in cramped hiding spaces with nothing but a datapad and some spare parts. At first, it was just something to do. In time, however, she grew to love the simplicity of building and working - and *improving* - any mechanical systems she could get her hands on. When she and Marina, Nadia's mother, escaped to Iruji with Joran in his ship, the *Nova*, it was like a dream come true. Here, finally, were the resources and safety to keep her tinkering mind busy forever with a near unlimited amount of resources with which to acquire rare and expensive parts, at least initially. She'd spent over half her life pouring over every nook and cranny of the ship, crowding it with redundant stealth systems and engine enhancements. Most of the compartments that weren't crammed full of conduits, spare panels, and overclocked processing stations featured her own creations - little mobiles and sculptures of wire and metal, ornately decorated with whatever else she managed to have leftover from her "projects" onboard.
In short, the *Nova* was closer to Kit than most living, breathing beings she'd ever met. She was still upset at Redar's recklessness and almost getting them killed, and nearly damaging her ship, but if there was one thing that might bring her out of a grudge, it was the opportunity to brag about her baby.
"**Glad you asked…**" she replied with a devilish grin. Kit brought up schematics, systems limits, and other kinds of minutia regarding the ship's capabilities. Most of it was unintelligible to the young Ranger but the sheer volume of data was somewhat overwhelming. He'd been ambushed by them after all, and one doesn't just park a ship a few meters behind even a rookie Iruji Ranger without him knowing about it unless there are at least a few special features installed. It also afforded Nadia the alone time she obviously needed, and Kit was happy to oblige there as well. The two talked tech for the remaining time in hyperspace, Redar being more talented in the *de*construction department. The two managed to get over the initial tension just fine - much to the dismay of any potential enemies trusting in technology for protection.
In the back, on her bunk, deep in meditation, Nadia's efforts to recieve guidance from the Force were mostly fruitless. The future, always changing, could be dangerous in its chimeric ability to draw seekers too far into trying to bring about conditions that could never be. The present, in contrast, wasn't much safer - only more sure. Many's the time a Jedi was pulled from the Light because of a vision. The minutes pass quickly for the young adventurer, now so far from her home. Kit's voice comes over the ship's comms, flat and distant, not wanting to disturb Nadia any more than necessary: "**Two minutes until we reach Felucia.**"
Those words have more affect on Nadia than the previous hours of meditation. She finds herself suddenly experiencing a waking vision, as if she's truly present on Felucia's surface, deep in its exotic jungles. Light and shadow play on the ground caused by the lush canopy clamoring for the bright sun above. Foreign sounds, close but just out of sight, envelope her senses - just the fauna, or something more? Greens, blues, and reds all confuse any attempt to see further than a few meters into the surrounding undergrowth, seeming to move without any noticeable wind. At her feet, large and scrawled on the ground in deep crimson, is the one symbol known the galaxy over - the Imperial ensignia. A voice comes rising over the other sounds, distant but somehow close, familiar, calling her by name. Nadia feels as if she should know the voice but can't place it, then she realizes it's not her name being called out.
The voice is calling for her mother, *Marina*.
The jungle crowds closer about her, the sounds growing more sinister and feral, eventually giving way to the noises of battle - blaster and lightsaber, explosions, ship's flying overhead, screams...
Suddenly, violently, Nadia is torn from the vision and left with an overwhelming sense of... something. The nightmares on Iruji were powerful and disconcerting. This one, in contrast, seems full of potential - not good or ill, just strong in significance. There was purpose in it somehow.
The stars outside her port shrink and come into focus. The *Nova* and its crew have arrived.

### **Alicia** (2014-03-22 12:24:50)

Sweat drips from her forehead, her meditation leaving her filled with the same dread the dream *or vision* she’d had on Iruji had left her that first night. Wiping the back of her hand against her forehead she gazes out the small viewport to the stars outside.
Sometime soon she was going to find out the meaning of these visions and she wasn’t as eager to discover it. Someone down there, if she was to put stock in this latest vision, knew her mother. If they were Imperial, it was very unlikely they were to be any sort of ally.
Going over to the small sink she washes her face and prepares to meet Kit. There was little point in sharing the vision. It did little to shine light on their current situation other than what they already knew: they would need to proceed with extreme caution.
Gathering the rest of the gear, she finishes removing the rest of the flight suit. It was doubtful on the planet she was going to be needing it. Instead she grabs a spare cloak from the closet and folds it over her arm.
Ready to go she opens the door and spots B3 recharging just a few steps away. “**Good to go, B3?**” she asks, trying to sound like her usual chipper self. Indicating the little compartment, she waits for the little remote to settle in comfortably in the custom made pouch. “**Stay close, ok?**”
Walking down the corridor to the cockpit she makes sure her blaster pistol has a full charge in it and does a quick inventory of the gear she’d brought. The comforting weight of her mother’s lightsaber swinging slightly at her belt the first thing for her to notice. Marina had made another one when she had bestowed this ancient looking lightsaber to her, claiming it had protected her since she had been a padawan in the Order. Given to her by her master before he died, Marina had carried it all throughout the war. Marina had also thought it to be a lesson and a reminder for Nadia, the words of the old Jedi code written using the High Galactic alphabet. Nadia had known to treasure the rare weapon, but was also wary about carrying it let alone using it.
Holstering her blaster at her hip she strides into the cockpit and takes a seat at the copilot’s station. She acknowledges her Wookie friend with a nod, not meeting her gaze and sets about scanning the area for their next step. Whether it be a ship in orbit or something catching her interest on the planet. The Imperial base in her vision, perhaps? She resists the urge to shiver as she recalls the sound of her mother’s name being called out.

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-23 13:16:10)

The cockpit is quiet but for the tapping of Kit on her keypad. No one, it seems, was willing to break the tense silence.
"**Hmm…**" she mutters, "**I think I found the destination for the transmission, but it's not very impressive.**"
The ship safely in stealth mode a good distance yet from the planet, she gives a quick brief and review of all the available data. A full holo of the base comes into view for all to see.
"**Best I can figure, this is where that broadcast was aimed. Thing is… it's just a little outpost. Most of the main facilities are over a kilometer away. I can't imagine why it wasn't relayed to the main communications array. In fact,**" she turns back to her screens for a moment, "**Yeah, the message was specifically encrypted with those coordinates. The primary base wouldn't even know about it unless the outpost relayed it, which is *possible*, just *weird*.**" The holo shows the local topography now, with a blinking flight path terminating a short distance from the small building. "**We can approach from here, and land here, without being detected. Probably. We'll have to hoof it from there though.**"
"**Sounds like fun,**" Redar chimes in, "**But I'll need more than my charm and good looks if we're expecting trouble.**"
Kit throws a little switch, opening a small weapons locker in the main corridor. It contains a few blaster rifles, pistols, grenades, and power packs. Nothing too powerful but enough to make a difference in the right hands. Redar nods his approval: "**Now *that* part of the ship, I understand!**"
Kit brings the *Nova* through orbit and into landing position in a small clearing. "**Keep your comlinks open. I'll monitor from here and swing by in case things turn sour. Good luck!**" The exit ramp extends to the jungle floor and Nadia is met with the sights and sounds not that different from the ones in her recent vision. The air is heavy though, and full of humidity and the smells of life. The whole planet, it would seem, is alive - this much even Nadia can sense. Alive, and very restless. A primal nature rules here, and all interlopers - Imperial or not - would do well to guard their steps. The dense jungle lay in all directions, dark and nearly impenetrable to even light itself. The direct route to the outpost is due Northeast from their current position. Redar checks his rifle, then motions to Nadia: "**Ladies first?**"

### **Alicia** (2014-03-23 22:27:13)

Glad Kit finally manages to break the silence she looks over the readings the Wookie had found. Nodding at the results but not liking what the could mean. "**Well, weird or not, let's hope the outpost hasn't sent out the intel yet. Something needs to be in our favor.**" Standing, she puts on the all-temp cloak she had swiped. "**I'll have B3 keep an open channel with. He's the only one with an encrypted channel and will be less likely to be intercepted.**" Hiding the dread she felt from the upcoming mission, she holds out her hand for Kit the shake. "**I'll see you soon.**" Trying a smile she adds, "**Don't be late when you get the party call, ok?**"
Not waiting any longer she meets Redar at the locker, taking her pick of a few of the grenades, not really interested in the charges having no knowledge in how to set them. From another locker she grabs a survival kit, hoping they weren't going to need it. Tightening the straps as she goes, she gives Redar a sideways glance as he checks over his rifle and motions for her to go first. While she's glad for the company, a part of her wishes that she didn't have to worry about another's life. A sentiment that doubles as she gets the full effect of the life on the planet. "**Stay wary…. This isn't Iruji, and we aren't welcome here. This planet doesn't like guests.**"
Glancing around she waits for Redar to join her at the bottom of the ramp. The most direct route would be to head directly north east, but on a planet as hostile as this one, established paths may not necessarily be the best route. Reaching out with the Force she allows her heightened senses guide her and keep her alert to any dangers.
Picking their path, she lets her hand rest on the butt of her pistol. "**Let's get going.**"

Nadia's heightened awareness in the Force serves her well, as more than once or twice they manage to avoid native wildlife that may have enjoyed a light snack. She just can't shake the feeling of being watched though. The pair eventually reach their destination - the Imperial listening post. Redar hands the macrobinoculars to Nadia: "**Doesn't look very active. I wonder where everyone went?**"
His words ring true - the outpost's plasteel walls and outer structure are nearly overgrown with vines and plant growth. Large swaths of rust cut across two sides and there's no personnel to be seen anywhere. There doesn't even seem to be much in the way of power. Mounted at the top of the two-story tower, however, is the unmistakable profile of a comms array. Unlike the rest of what they see, it seems free of rust and undergrowth. The main entrance appears unguarded. "**It's late. The sun will be down in an hour or two. Do you want to wait or just go knock?**"
Redar smiles and lifts the flap on his satchel, revealing the explosive charge Nadia passed on. Whatever else may be said about the young Ranger, he certainly didn't mind a good pyrotechnic show.

### **Alicia** (2014-03-28 23:30:42)

The hike had been a long one Nadia realizes as they find themselves their little lookout among the overgrowth. Unable to shake the feeling of being watched she's more wary of their surroundings than the structure before them. Her abilities no doubt had proved useful during their treacherous journey, but it also left her with an uneasy feeling. With Redar's observations about the outpost she has her own look.
Taking the macrobinocualrs when he offers them she casts furtive glances around the exterior of the complex and frowns. Handing the macrobinoculars back to Redar Nadia shakes her head evenly. "**No… I don't think it's necessary.**" Relieving herself of the pack, she leaves it for Redar who was probably going to need it more than her in the near future. "**I'm gonna go in… alone. Might need you to knock later if things don't go well.**" Looking toward the outpost she couldn't help get the impression they were being invited in almost. Or whoever was inside just wanted the outpost to seem like a really good target. She expects objections from the Ranger but she wasn't exactly interested in hearing them.
Tapping B3, she dislodges him out of his little pouch and holds him hovering above her hand. "**Can you scout ahead for me, B3? Stay out of sight and wait for my signal if I need you to get me out.**" Loosening her pistol in the holster she keeps her hand on it and ready. Giving Redar a small nod as a salute she circles back around to another direction to approach the outpost from and heads towards the front gate.

### **BWS2K** (2014-03-29 12:11:24)

The little droid is able to chirp back occasional observations of the building but they're little more than variations on what Nadia already knew: The place *looked* deserted. Casually strolling up to the gate, she still can't shake the feeling of being watched - but that might just be what it was like on Felucia. A jungle planet teeming with life meant you probably *were* catching the eye of *something*. The gate lay partially open, the control panel thick with growth and rust and unpowered. Nadia passes through easily. Now that she's within only a few meters of the actual facility, little more than just the main tower and outlying gate, she notices something both she and Redar (and B3) had missed - cables, clean and definitely either new or recently installed, ran along one wall and up to the comm dish. The building might have been left for the jungle but someone wanted to keep that part working.
Like the gate, the one door to the outpost is unpowered and easily - though cautiously - pushed aside. Just as she steps through into the main corridor, past the undergrowth that had managed to work it's way inside the entrance, a few things come into view. First, the darkness. Without a doubt, whatever power might be used on the communications system wasn't being used for lighting. The fading light of day stretches only a few paces down the hallway. Secondly, the quiet. A faint hum is all that can be heard, presumably from the live cables running along the wall and into the shadows. Whatever answers were to be had were down there somewhere.
An adventure at heart but strong in the Force, Nadia does credit to her training as she proceeds cautiously into the building. She flicks on her glowrod, keeping it low and walking carefully. More than a few panels slide under her weight, further evidence of the station being derelict. The minutes go by as she makes her way down into the sub-level, following the cables hastily fixed to the bulkhead or winding along the deck. Nadia eventually reaches a closed hatch, beyond which she can hear the faint sounds of activity. Markings on the hatch read "*Station 5 Control Room*". The telltale sounds of tapping at a computer station, and the louder sound of something providing power - a portable generator, most likely, lead her to conclude that she's traveled so far to see what's in that room.
Kit's voice crackles quietly in Nadia's earpiece: "**Hey, no rush, but I'm picking up comm traffic from the local Imperials. They're still a few kilometers out but headed this way. Routine patrols I guess. That might be a problem. Whatever you're going to do, do it soon.**"

I don't like to railroad, but you should probably open that door... ![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)
Also, because I've been waiting to do this for weeks, it's Control Room **5**, which is **V** in Roman Numerals, so it's **Control** Room **V**... like Ctrl-V... like the title of the thread...! And Nadia is Marina's daughter... like a sort of clone... or *copy*...! Eh?! Do I win GM points for that??!!

Being so close to her target Nadia doesn't confirm verbally the news Kit had just given her. Trusting the ship had come in unnoticed, that must mean they were heading this way. There was one thing the young Jedi knew: she wanted answers. Working slowly, she attempts to open the door as quietly as she’s able. Taking a deep breath she hopes whoever was inside was alone and was too distracted to notice as she nudges the door open and creeps inside using the darkness to her advantage.

The hatch opens slowly, though not without some finesse, to reveal a poorly-lit room. Small, and mostly in the condition of the rest of the facility, she can see a number of powered consoles crowded into the center of the room. A portable generator is running in the corner, cables running both to the computers and, presumably, out to the comm dish. The central station, around which the room has been arranged, is occupied by someone huddled over the controls and facing away. All this, Nadia is able to take in at a glance.
The familiar transmission begins to play in a mechanical voice: <*Emergency broadcast… passive scans reveal presence of sentient lifeforms…local communications tap complete…Jedi presence confirmed…one positive match to archive entry Joran Nor…one positive match to archive entry Marina Numa…*> The figure at the station listens quietly, identity hidden from Nadia's vantage point.
The room suddenly fills with noise and light, alarms blaring: "**No! Not yet, not when I'm so close…!**" The voice shuts off and the center display shows the trio of incoming ships - the patrol Kit had already detected. A timer begins counting down on the screen from five minutes.

As the probe droids message repeats, the same sense of dread she had experienced at hearing it the first time returns. *I have to destroy the evidence.* The thought becomes all the more important as the countdown begins reminding her soon the Empire would be swarming the base.
Creeping into the room, Nadia moves in as quickly as she can while the man was distracted. Drawing out her blaster, she moves in as close to the man as she can and lets the barrel touch the back of his neck. “**Afraid you have less time than you think.**” Nudging him slightly with the pistol so he gets the idea, she adds. “**Don’t be doing anything silly, now.**”

### **Alicia** (2014-04-02 10:16:03)

At Nadia's words, and firm encouragement with her blaster, the figure raises his hands slowly: "You mean like waste time sneaking around here with Imperials on their way?" Had she been watched after all? Certainly he couldn't have detected the Nova...? The voice is baritone, middle-aged and familiar - and then it hits Nadia: It's the voice from her vision. Reeling for a moment, she has to focus to catch his next words. "Trust me, child, if they find us all the others will perish too."
"Then you'll understand why I have to destroy this place... and all your data," Nadia says taking a step back and lowering the blaster slightly. In a near whisper she opens her comms. "Redar, you have about a minute to get to my position and blow this place up."
The man, for it was, indeed, a man in what Nadia would guess is his mid-thirties or early forties, with just a slight bit of gray starting to show in his dark hair, lowered his hands and turned in the chair. "Yes, that's one way to do things I suppose. Permit me a few moments of exposition to alter that, um, -straightforward- plan a little? I'm not sure how you got here but that's one of the more advanced pieces of tech up on the roof. Chances are good that nobody else spotted you either, though I've been able to follow you for some time on these..." He punches up a set of displays that show the facility from a myriad of angles, including the corridor just outside. "I won't disagree that we need to destroy the data, but let me show you something else." A hatch opens in the wall behind him, with running lights descending steeply out of sight. Redar comes bursting into the room just then, B3 in tow, charge already primed. A quick glance at the stranger and he decides it's best to stick to the plan - he sets the charge against the main station and places a few grenades around the area for good measure. "We should probably hurry," say the man, indicating the timer, now at an even three minutes and counting.
Nadia glances over at the new doorway, surmising that was how the man was planning to vacate the area in an emergency. She didn't care how familiar this man seemed, or the fact he seemed almost just as concerned as she was that the data was about to fall into Imperial hands. Narrowing her eyes at him she asks, "You don't have another copy somewhere do you?"
"No, no other copies, but that wouldn't be necessary." He stands and motions for the party to make haste. "You know how to get back there anyway, don't you? The planet where I sent my probe?"
Redar makes one last check of his work and nods to Nadia. Kit's voice comes over the comlink, flat and even-toned: "Approximately two minutes to intercept. You want a pick-up?"
Nadia hesitates for a moment, then: "Forget it, I'm not asking. Be there in a couple seconds."
Nadia ignores the man's almost rhetorical inquiry, glancing over at Redar and his work. Grabbing B3 from mid-air she puts him in the old converted pouch. She curses mildly as a response to Kit's communique. "No, Kit.. Don't expose the Nova... We'll circle around and avoid the Imps." Looking at the man she motions he should go first. "Where does this go anyways?"
"Someplace I'm sure you'll appreciate."
Nadia exchanges a furtive glance with Redar, before following behind the stranger. Her blaster at the ready in the event he should double cross them.
An irritated Wookie shrug comes through the comm channel: "...okay. But I hope you have a plan."
The trio step quickly through the passageway and find that it's little more than a series of descending ramps leading a couple stories below ground. At first, it's plasteel and permacrete, but it gives way, after time, to natural rock and dirt. It only takes no more than a minute to reach the bottom of the shaft and another small hatch, half-buried in roots, vines, and shadow. The stranger opens it and reveals a well-lit cavern beyond. The chamber itself seems to be mostly rock formation, with a large fire-pit in the center and several smaller fires dispersed throughout. Nadia estimates no less than twenty Wookies of various ages, all staring at her and Redar.
"Wookies on Felucia... Have to say I wasn't expecting that twist." Nadia steps into the cavern, looking with wide-eyed surprise at the group of Wookies.
"That makes two of us," comes Redar's reply.
The man brushes past and start speaking in quick but passable Wookiespeak to one of the larger males: "" A few gestures and some names are mentioned and he returns to Nadia. The Wookies are already packing up and headed toward the back of the cavern.
"Well, they'll be all set. Now how's about us - what's our escape plan? I can get us as far as Split Tree Gorge, that's about a half a kilometer away. I assume your friend can pick us up there...?"
Nadia watches mildly at first as the Wookies begin to pack up. She frowns trying to estimate how much space they had on the Nova for the refuges. There was of course no reason why she shouldn't bring them. His statement brings her attention back to him with a snap. "Us? I don't even know who YOU are?"
The man looks at her for a moment, his features fully visible now in the orange glow. She's seen the face before, sort of, but it takes a minute to place. She makes the guess a split-second before he speaks: "Of course not, forgive me. Even your mother might find it hard to recognize me. I haven't caught your name but I'd never forget her eyes. You have them too. I'm Arek Bannon, and I'm pretty sure I'm your father."
Nadia realizes the truth just moments before he declared it. Visions aside, her mother had shown her holo images of when she was younger, training under her master and their pilot, Arek Bannon. While she had been wondering what had happened to her father, the fact he had put her through so much trouble miffed her. "Well... 'pops'," she says the word with a great deal of exaggeration. "Don't expect a parade when you see her," she says walking past him and toward the rear of the cave.
He wonders if that could've gone worse, decides it could have and that conversations were better had later. He turns and hurries to the back of the cave, Redar in tow. They make it into the narrow tunnels just as the first explosion rips through the facility. Dirt falls on shoulders and the entire ceiling threatens to cave-in as secondary detonations shake the jungle. Above, one of the patrol craft is incinerated as it passes over the outpost at just the wrong time. The other two break away and report the occurrence, though whether anyone will be able to find anything in what's left of the facility, or the downed craft, is highly questionable.
The group travels for some time, held up only by the occasional narrow passage causing a bottleneck for the larger Wookies, before reaching a small cave, open on one side to the jungle. It's covered in hanging vegetation but once it's parted Nadia can see a reasonable clearing for Kit to pick them up. Just how many passengers she can take, though, remains to be seen.
Now that they're clear of the now ruined listening outpost she opens up the comm to Kit. "I've got a surprise for you... Think you can come pick us up here at this gorge? Looks to be a good sized clearing the Nova will fit into." She turns on her bracer and sends the coordinates through the transmission.
"Be there in a second!" Clearly, Kit's been waiting for the call.
She arrives in a couple minutes and puts down just outside the entrance. "Probably should get going, they're already starting to send in a team to-" Her words stop short as she reaches the bottom of the ramp and spots the Wookies. She pauses, studying their faces in turn, and then lets her eyes come to rest on Arek. Without looking, she asks, "Nadia... what's going on here?"
"Let's just say we can all go home now," Nadia says moving to step up next to her friend. "Can we talk about it later?" she says quietly, sounding tired.
The Wookies seem quiet, watching Kit as she watches them. Nadia can feel the empathy in the Force, the draw that calls to her friend even as she herself begins to realize it. "It's okay, you go. I think I'll stay."
Behind them, Redar nudges Arek, and the two start up the ramp. The Ranger knows enough to not mess with Kit's moment, and Arek knows the Wookies wouldn't leave anyway. Perhaps only Kitkatta would truly understand the meaning of a home, if only as a place to stop the running.
"Tell Mr. Joran thanks for everything," she says, using her nickname for the Jedi Knight who rescued her from the Empire, "But I think I've found my home."
Nadia stops and looks forlornly at Kit and then at the Wookies. She steps in to give her friend a big hug, letting the moment sink in since she didn't know when they would see each other again. "You're my best friend, Kit. I'm going to miss you."
Kit returns the hug with that combination of ferocity and warmth that only a Wookie could muster. "I'll miss you too, girlie, and your mom... but I -might- miss that -ship- more. You take care of it, okay?" She grins and taps B3's pouch. "I'll see you around, Bee!" With one last look at Nadia and then the Nova, Kit waves farewell and enters the cave. Nadia can't help but feel that her life is just beginning.
Her comlink comes alive again, this time with Redar's voice: "Look alive. We better get moving if we don't want to be spotted." The engines come alive and the tell tale sounds of Imperial craft can be heard above the dark jungle.
"Give those Imps hell," Nadia says to Kit's retreating back and is brought back to the present as Redar's voice rings in her ear. Glad he's already warming up the engines, she races onto the Nova, letting the ramp close behind her. Tapping the pouch she brings B3 out as she runs towards the cockpit. "B3, get to engineering and be ready to get us some speed out of those engines."
The Nova rises slowly from the deep jungle of Felucia and then blasts off into the night sky, leaving behind a friend - and a mystery for the local authorities to think on for a while. Ultimately, however, they find little more than twisted bits of metal and smouldering ashes. They'll have barely enough time to focus on anything other than a sudden increase in raids and sabotage on Imperial storehouses soon enough.
Aboard the Nova, as the navicomputer calculates the jump back to Iruji, a new friendship begins. The Rangers are always looking for someone bold enough to defy an entire planet of bureaucracy to fix a problem, especially if it means causing a little trouble for the Empire. Ensign Redar Beren looks forward to his future, as Arek Bannon ponders his own. How will Marina treat this sudden revelation after all this time, and what of Nadia, his daughter? Back on Iruji, Joran Nor and Marina Numa are restless too, but each for their own reasons. The Living Force is not bound by distance. In it, loved ones are always near.

A few hours later, once the *Nova* has landed and Redar has left to deliver the final portion of his report to the Rangers, Nadia, Marina, and Arek have some time to themselves. News of Kit's new home makes its way to Joran, who is both saddened for the loss of his friend and student and glad to know she'd finally found a cause to fight for. The planet seems to breathe a collective sigh of relief at the revelation that, somehow, the Empire was *not* going to show up at any minute. As is typical with the bureaucratic process, it still takes several days before anything is settled for sure.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

So I guess that's my lead-in. Not much but I'm not sure what to do. A chat seems appropriate - between who? I assumed the three of them but if you think differently, that's alright too. I have nothing further for Joran or Redar for this adventure, so it's all about wrapping up Arek's appearance. Lemme know. Cheers!

### **Alicia** (2014-04-05 20:28:53)

Nadia for the most part avoids Arek on the way back to Iruji. Focusing on the plans for the ship, the advances Kit had implemented and planned making a rather interesting diversion then having to deal with her emotions of her father's sudden appearance. However, as she looks over her friend's notes, she can't help feel sadness at their diverging paths and the possibility they'd never see each other again. The one consolation was Kit had found a cause to fight for and kin to fight with. All in all, Kit had found where she was to belong.
After a brief exchange with the orbiting Rangers, landing on the planet was easy enough and she chooses the free landing pad near the Cloudspinner estate to touch down. Nadia takes her time in shutting down the systems, knowing soon enough the Cloudspinner clan, or at least those who had not yet left the planet would be coming to greet them.
From the cliff side mansion she spots her mother, Marina, approaching the landing zone. Realizing she hadn't yet told her mother about Arek's presence on board she hurries up with the shutdown and heads for the ramp. She meets Redar just as he's about to open lower the ramp and with a snide smile she gives the parting words, "**Be sure to give B'Ri my regards.**" And enjoys the look Redar gives her as he heads off.
Following not far behind Redar is Arek, and she looks at him for what must seems like a long moment. "**Welcome to Iruji,**" she says flatly and stops off the ship, heading for her mother.
Nadia can't help but to admire her. Marina stands patiently nearby, her hands folded neatly in front of her in a manner Nadia realizes is very similar to how Jaya stands. With not much mechanical needing repair, Marina had taken to learning to take her grandmother's place as an elder and she was dressed the part in the plain white blouse and the ankle length skirt covering the tops of her boots. B3 breaks away from his pouch and races Nadia to greet Marina, flying around the older woman's head beeping wildly.
Marina laughs, playfully swatting the enthusiastic droid away, "**Hello, B3.**" Nadia isn't far behind and finds herself being embraced. "**Well done, Nadia.**" But then she looks behind her daughter at the man walking down the ramp and she stiffens. Her hands still on her shoulder she looks at her daughter's face. "**You have been busy.**"
Nadia looks behind her at Arek and decides she doesn't want to witness her parents' reunion. "**I'm going for a walk.**" Without much more of an explanation she heads towards the path which would take her up to the Reaches.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-05 22:18:20)

Marina Numa is too stunned to keep Nadia from walking off as her gaze watches the man she believed dead walk toward her.
Arek Bannon It'd been a long time since they'd seen each other, and Arek knew he had changed considerably. They all had - the galaxy wasn't the same place it was seventeen years ago.
Arek Bannon: "...hey." he says, walking slowly down the ramp and towards Marina. His appearance - the haggard face, the ragged garb of an Imperial deserter, the heavy years on his shoulders - he was glad to see that Marina seemed to recognize him, at least.
Marina Numa: "Hey..." she repeats, her hands folding in front of her out of habit when she has no idea what to do with them. She glances over at Nadia's retreating back as she disappears over a rise in the cliff side.
"It's... been awhile," she says lamely.
Arek Bannon: "It has." Arek glances in Nadia's direction: "So... Nadia..." He reflects back on the events of the day and can't help but grin wide, "She's definitely takes after you. Made quite an impression the Imperials today."
The moment is a good one, but over quickly when he wonders at his own words. This is the first time he's really had a conversation since finally breaking free of the Empire so many months ago. Referring to his ex-comrades as Imperials, as if he hadn't been flying right there with them only last year, was an odd experience. The Empire was corrupt, no doubt about that, but battle still had a way of forging strong bonds. The thought passes and he rushes to fill the impending silence: "It's good to see you." His sincerity doesn't make up for the fact that he feels like a teenager again, and not the grown man he had become, but it was still there nonetheless.
Marina Numa shows a moment of pride as he mentions Nadia's deeds and then her expression grows sober. "She still has some growing up to do." Her attention comes back to the man in front of her. "Look at us... gawking at each other like teenagers,' she says with a laugh. "Let's head inside."
Arek Bannon follows Marina's lead. He can't help but hope there's a meal involved, having spent most of his recent time hunkered down in that outpost searching for the woman with little else to eat but Imperial rations. Not the good ones either.
Marina Numa pauses for a moment as they draw near the mansion carved into the rock. "Uh, I should probably warn you... we live with a bunch of my relations. They can be rather... nosy."
Arek: "That's fine by me. I've sort of been hiding behind a computer station for almost a year. I don't want my people skills to get -too- rusty."
Arek Bannon 'Such a different place', thinks Arek, 'Than Felucia. There, the whole planet seemed to take on a life of its own. No matter what you cut down or buried, it'd be right back the next day. And usually with some sort of thorns or poison, just to prove a point. This place is... different.'
Marina Numa leads Arek up to the front door and just inside the entrance the pair are stopped as a white haired elderly woman, still full of youthful energy steps in, her attention focused on the datapad in her hand. One of the few technological conveniences the Irujians kept around.
Jaya: "Ah, Marina dear there you are. Ensign Redar is getting ready to present his report to the council." The elderly woman stops, her gaze catching Arek's. It's the same as Marina's. "I see we have company."
Marina Numa: "Nana... this is Arek Bannon. Arek, Elder Jaya Cloudspinner."
Jaya takes the situation in stride and steps forward to shake Arek's hand. "You can just call me Nana, Arek. Everyone in this house does." She smiles kindly and exchanges a glance with Marina. "Well then, dears. You can make use of my study... You shouldn't be bothered there."
Arek Bannon: "A pleasure to meet you, Nana," is Arek's reply. He wonders exactly how many other people there might be in this place, though it did look rather large from the outside. He nods for Marina to continue leading the way, "Sounds good to me...?"
Marina Numa nods to Jaya "You'll make excuses to the council for me?"
Jaya: "Of course, dear. Don't worry." She gives them another smile and heads out.
Marina Numa bobs her head toward an adjoining hallway. "This way."
Arek Bannon enters the study after Marina and takes a seat, glad to finally be sitting in something comfortable that wasn't traveling at light speed. He clears his throat and begins: "Well. You seem to have taken care of yourself. It took me quite some time to find you, and considerably more time to make sure that I was the -only- one. It was a needle in a haystack on a planet full of haystacks, you might say. But I'm glad it worked out."
Marina Numa takes a seat in one of the reading chairs Jaya kept. The study itself is old, being one of the original rooms built when the house was first carved out of the rock. It's been decorated to be comfortable, the stone walls hidden by bookshelves and tapestries, some detailing the exploits of the Cloudspinner family. The floor is carpeted making it rather homey. Lit using a soft light from the cieling there's no sign of how deep into the mountain they've actually gone.
Marina Numa: "How did you manage to find me? I was very careful not to leave a trace I'd been here during the war."
Arek Bannon: "Hmm." Arek has to think about that a bit. It wasn't really easy to say how. The years of pouring over star charts, secretly stealing the pieces to construct a probe droid, assembling a base in the jungle and keeping it from prying eyes. That was the logistics of it. But how did he know -where- to send the probe? Well, that wasn't as easy to explain. Arek breathes deeply and settles back, banking more on his charm than his ability to cite details: "In the end, I guess you'd just call it luck."
Marina Numa looks amused and shakes her head. "The Force has its own plan and apparently it wanted to bring us all together."
Arek Bannon: "Yeah, all of us. Like... our -daughter-...? She's something, eh? I mean, I've seen a lot of things in my life, and I think I was prepared for just about all of it - except for that."
Arek Bannon thinks back on how many families he'd seen torn apart by the Empire, and, too, what he'd learned about the Force. Things like that didn't really register much on his radar, but anything was possible. It was a big galaxy.
Marina Numa looks away from him for a long moment, her fingers drumming on the armrest in the old habit when she was thinking of what to say. "Yes... Our daughter."
Marina Numa: "She's been the best part of my life... I'm sorry I kept her from you, but... I knew if I revealed her existence that we'd both lose her." She let's the words hang there. "No amount of apologies and excuses can make up for the seventeen years you've missed. I just hope you can see she's been safe here, happy... and loved." The words come out in a breathless string. Long ago she'd wonder how she would face Arek learning of Nadia's existence, but nothing could have prepared her for this moment.

### **BWS2K** (2014-04-07 20:28:53)

Realizing his words may have been a bit harsh, Arek replies placatingly: "**Oh, I'm sure. I mean, that much is *obvious*. No, you did really great.**"
He's truly happy to be here, at long last, and being safe is just a bonus. The years apart hadn't been absent of thoughts of Marina, or of what could be. She wasn't his first girl, or even his last, but Arek never could quite get her out of his head. It was Marina he was thinking of when in the heat of battle. Years of that finally convinced him to stop playing the hypocrite and seek her out, abandoning his post with the Empire and going into hiding. Finding the Wookie underground and being able to use some of their equipment and connections was a stroke of luck - although now he wasn't so sure. Perhaps the Force was more real than he had cared to admit...
"**I'm glad to have found you, Marina.**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Does this scene even *need* anything more?! I mean, in a movie this would be the close-up of Arek, a quick shot of Marina's smile and bashful eyes, and then cut to Nadia in the woods. Probably start with a wide shot and B3 chirping away, and a little dialogue before the ghost of Saalo Morn makes some sort of Next-Chapter-ish offer.

### **Alicia** (2014-04-10 21:18:28)

Marina seems to relax from a weight she’s had to deal with over the decades and she smiles. “**I’m glad you’ve found us.**” She frowns remembering Nadia’s state when she had come back. “**Nadia is too, though it may seem hard to believe right now. She’s been looking for you, and I think she’s a bit disappointed in how it happened.**” Letting the words hang there a bit, she wonders only briefly what will happen next.
“**We have a lot of catching up to do,**” she smiles at Arek, knowing at least some of it was going to be interesting and yet also dreading as she knew part of his story would lay to rest what happened to Silas Draay, her final master. “**I think though, you should seek out Nadia.**”

### **BWS2K** (2015-03-14 08:30:44)

Arek does leave, and despite being new to the area - to the entire planet, in fact - he does manage to make his way through the well-traveled paths of The Reaches. He's in no particular rush but, as the hours pass, he begins to wonder just how far Nadia might have gone. It was a simple matter of re-tracing his own steps to return for dinner, hoping that maybe he and his daughter had just missed each other. A sad chuckle is brought to Arek Bannon as he reflects on the gravity of that thought.
Still, it was getting dark and if, by chance, something *had* happened then there was very little he could do on his own... aside from become lost himself. A sound all too familiar suddenly breaks the quiet calm of the forest. A speeder bike barrels along the path and whines as it comes to a stop just a few meters from Arek. It's one of the Iruji Rangers: "**Mr. Bannon? You'll need to come with me, sir, right away.**"
Upon his return, Marina tells of the vision she had of Nadia. Clouded as they always are, it was beyond doubt that she was in very grave danger. The Rangers were out combing the area, newly-promoted Lieutenant Redar Beren leading the operation, but surely a smaller crew with different training - and more than a little luck - could manage the task with greater success.

Chat session log as follows:
*Nadia holds her lightsaber at the ready, knowing full well the last thing she wanted was for these things to get too close. She'd have to worry later about how they managed to get on Iruji in the first place.*
*The beasts hurry to flank the young Jedi, not satisfied with their first course for the afternoon…*
*Nadia watches as the creatures circle around her and not wanting to get flanked starts backpedding toward the bridge to force them to stay in front of her.*
*Nadia calling on the Force she throws one into the other, hoping that would keep that attention on her.*
*Not agile creatures by any means, rakghouls are still quite hearty. Nadia's efforts do manage to hurl one across the body in the path, setting him down roughly next to the other…*
*the first rakghoul attempts to take a quick bite out of Nadia's leg. Not the most graceful move, but potentially deadly…*
*Nadia manages to dodge out of the way of the creature's poisoness bite*
*It's a narrow miss, but the second follows suit…*
*…and fails as well.*
*Nadia continues retreating backwards, hoping to draw the creatures away from the ranger and slashes at them with her lightsaber.*
*the blade does its work well, finishing off the beast already wounded by Nadia's previous Force-powered attack…*
*"Come on you ugly bastard…" she says, coaxing the final one to follow her*
*Whether it's the taunt or the relative instability of the four-legged rakghoul on the wooden bridge, its bite goes wide, missing Nadia with room to spare…*
*Nadia is emboldened by her previous success and so swings at the final rakghoul*
*Nadia holds her ground as the bridge creaks beneath her feet*
*The beast on the bridge eyes Nadia hungrily but before he has a chance to make his move, the body on the path starts to twitch. It doesn't take a hyperphysicist to know what that means…*
*The bite stumbles Nadia, and she can feel the dreaded poison entering her veins already…*
*Nadia gasps as she feels the poison beginning to work on her system. Knowing she likely doesn't have much time, she tries to finish the fight quickly*
*Another deadly swipe with her lightsaber brings the second rakghoul near-death, but not as the inevitable happens…*
*Nadia backpeddals off of the bridge*
*The wounded rakghoul leaps for Nadia and claws wearily at her but misses completely. Whether her luck will hold with the new arrival, however, remains to be seen…*
*Nadia dodges neatly to the side as she's charged and slices at it as it draws near.*
*Nadia starts withdrawing for the bridge again.,*
*The Force is strong with Nadia, and the rakghoul has barely gained his footing from his own attack before his front limbs are severed completely. Together with his previous wound, he is defeated…*
*Undaunted by the corpses of his fallen kin, the new rakghoul follows Nadia out onto the bridge, in no hurry to finish her off. Only moment old, he well knows the work the poison in her blood will wreak soon enough…*
*Nadia continues making her way across the bridge and unleashes the fury of her lightsaber as she goes*
*…and what a fury it is! The arrogant beast is quickly given a lesson in toying with a cornered Jedi as Nadia saber rakes across his gruesome visage, blinding him in one eye and eliciting a primal scream from his throat…*
*Grievously wounded as he is, but with the determination only brought about by instinctual hatred of all things living, the last rakghoul clumsily claws for Nadia and misses…*
*Nadia wants to end this once and for all. Especially before she's overcome by the poison*
*The rakghoul is finally dispatched with one last slice of Nadia's blade. She's not out of the woods yet though, figuratively and literally, as the rakghoul's venom courses through her body and she fights to not succumb to its deadly pull…*
*Nadia stumbles backwards before setting out in a Force infused run back toward the compound. Slowing down after getting some distance she pulls out her commlink opening a channel to anyone she can get.*

The years on Iruji had left Marina plenty of time for meditation. Or at least what time was left after raising and training her daughter, helping her grandmother along with her many cousins and relatives with the estate and most recently, learning from Jaya what would be expected of her as a chosen elder.
The latter was an honor she never would have expected having come to the planet much later in life, while there had been many who had lived here all their lives. Jaya said it was because she had a perspective of the galaxy outside of their charmed system, one that one day would benefit them. Marina took the honor as it was.
Now with Arek and Nadia off on their own adventure, their roles now reversed, Marina took what time she could to center herself. The Force of course had other ideas. The same sense of impending doom comes over her. The same one she had felt 16 years ago after Nadia had been born and again three years after that when Nadia had been kidnapped by the Spirit of Saalo Morn.
This time, however, she had a better idea of the cause. *Rakghouls? Here?* Knowing that until she had proof of their existence the Rangers likely would scoff it down to fantasy, but with the risk being what it was to the planet and to her daughter she had to let them know.
It was a simple matter to call a meeting of the essential people: rangers and elders, but another matter entirely to get them moving toward action. Arek was soon retrieved and after sharing her vision, she knew that they would have greater success in finding Nadia and the cause of this latest epidemic.
The pearl she wore on her bracelet, connected to her daughter’s life force was turning an unusual color and pulsed with Nadia’s distress. Nadia in her vision had been trying to make her way back home, but under the circumstances, it was possible that Nadia had gotten herself lost in the midst of her panic.Marina was tied to her, and it was possible that their connection would allow Marina to find Nadia. Before it was too late.
“**I’m going out there,**” she calmly announces and glances at everyone in attendance daring them to stop her. Just as calmly she gets up to gather her gear.

The head table where higher ranked Rangers were discussing matters with the Elders, and the myriad side conversations among the ranks of others who'd heard of the missing Nadia, are suddenly quieted by Marina's announcement. Not that she was ever one to explain herself.
"**Marina, I… I don't think-**" starts Redar, but he stops short. "**Very well. Stay safe.**" All eyes watch her leave with the knowledge that whoever or whatever had caused Nadia to go missing was about to meet one fierce Jedi mother.
A light rain is falling as Marina steps outside. As she makes her way through the Reaches and night begins to fall, the rain picks up. Now, with twilight nearly gone and water dripping off the edges of her robes and muffling sights and sounds of the forest, she finds the Force has guided her to a not-altogether-unexpected location - a small rift in the ground, now quiet overgrown, with steps carved into the stone face. Marina hasn't been to the tomb of Saalo Morn in a long time but some things are never forgotten.

With the hood of her cloak pulled up, protecting her from the worst of the rain, she forged ahead into the Reaches. Like her daughter she had come to know the terrain, but with the threat of a Rakghoul outbreak she keeps her senses sharp. Every so often, she’d idly touch the lifestone at her wrist, reassuring herself she was on the right path and Nadia was still very much alive.
Stepping at the edge of the craig, she peers down into the darkness before looking around once more.
While Nadia thankfully didn’t recall her experience with Saalo Morn on a conscious level, Marina knew that a part of her daughter would always be connected to this place. Even though the spirit of the Dark Jedi had likely dispersed after Joran had destroyed the helm his spirit had attached to, the place still held some of the taint his presence had left. Marina only had Joran’s account to go off and her own thoughts upon visiting the place once she had recovered from the ordeal, but it had seemed her ancestor, Jacelyn Cloudspinner and Saalo Morn had left the place for good.
“**What are you doing here?**” Marina wonders aloud.

Marina's words echo through the rocks covered in damp vegetation but are quickly muffled in the sounds of the falling rain. All is quiet for a moment, and then a dim figure begins to materialize in the rain above the chasm. It's a male, older, and clad in robes but with a scholarly air about him - as if he should be carrying scrolls or studying ancient script. He appears in only a faint blue hue, obscured even further by the rain. While definitely a Force presence of some kind, and almost certain with a Dark Side feel, Marina isn't filled with a sense of hostility or menace as she had been with Saalo Morn.
"**Ah, it's finally you. I see you're alone though, no sign of… Well, it doesn't matter. You're hear about your daughter. Again. She's here, I assure you, though you may find it more difficult to traverse these halls than last time.**"

Marina looks at the ghostly in surprise as he appears in front of her. A long list of questions comes to mind, but she settles on one that she finds the most important for the moment. “**Who are you? Who else were you expecting?**” She stops herself from asking another, her old habits rising to the surface in the crisis. A more import question comes to mind as an old fear comes to mind. One where her daughter was brought here to this old crypt by someone rather than coming of her own violation. “**Is Nadia down there alone?**”

The phantom wavers in response to her first questions: "**Just a humble student of the once-great Lord Saalo Morn.**" At this, the Dark Side presence seems to increase tenfold for a moment. "**Oh, hush now,**" replies the force spirit, glancing back over the ruined crypt, "**He's become quite unmanageable now, no thanks to you and your iron-willed helm-cleaving friend. I'd hoped… *we'd* hoped to see something of a re-match. Alas, you shall have to do. Don't worry about me or Morn, we're hardly capable of interfering now even if we wanted. Playing ghost is the best I ever learned and the Diminished Lord Saalo Morn is little more than a very angry vapor.**"
He shimmers, the raindrops falling clearly through his form now - Marina can sense his power waning. "**Alone? No, I'm afraid not. Some headstrong bumblers have finally tracked down the crypt and had hoped to learn the secrets within. As if they would know what to do with anything down there! They tripped a… *defensive device* of mine. You and your companion were infinitely more perceptive in your visit and that cursed Light Side Hag never bothered to study her surroundings. You're hear because my device worked, even after all these years, and you can expect much more than your daughter in those dark corridors.**"
He looks back before concluding and addresses Marina while glancing over his shoulder. "**You'll find entering the crypt much easier this time around, the oafs made sure of that. Destroy them all for us, won't you?**" With that, he gives Marina a final nod and begins to fade into the shadows from where he came.
