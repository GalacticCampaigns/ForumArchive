### **BWS2K** (2013-08-25 09:28:03)

**Specifics**

* Characters do *not* have to be droids but *must* be droid/mechanically-themed. Examples would include (but are not limited to) mechanics, technicians, slicers, cybernetically-enhanced soldiers, or a member of the Shard species (p.79, JATM).
* This will take place during the *Rise of the Empire* era, starting a few years before Alderaan gets Deathstarred (4BBY), though whether or not that has much significance in our game depends on player/character choices. I just think it's a really exciting time to play in, even if we never see a stormtrooper.
* I like to keep it loose as far as post-frequency, and since it'll be a number of solo threads initially, I'll ask for at least one post a week. Faster is certainly possible, but if I don't hear from a player after a week I might have to arrange for a self-destructâ€¦
* Combat is likely but not the focus of the campaign, so don't worry about keeping track of individual shots (exceptions to be discussed if necessary, i.e. rockets). Instead, if a natural **1** is rolled as an Attack Roll this represents the weapon being empty, jamming, or otherwise requiring re-loading.
* Please provide references for non-core material.
* Please provide a level breakdown of your build in a spoiler when submitting a character.
* I'm going to open for *three* player slots, to start solo at first and then possibly join up later. If the player wants to stay solo, that's fine too.

**Character Guidelines**

* 5th-level, any class, 36pts (droids use 34pts and can't be Force Sensitive, naturally).
* Standard Destiny Point rules. Be as creative as you like!
* You can use *Scavengers' Guide to Droids* for chassis creation rules if you like, but Chapter 11 of the Corebook is fine.
* Maximum starting wealth from your first class (for whatever you want) *plus* 2000 credits. I don't require that you have the *Tech Specialist* feat in order to purchase upgrades like Enhanced Dexterity, but there are pricing rules that I *will* enforce (i.e. "*one-tenth the cost of the item/droid to be modified or 1000 credits, whichever is more*").
* Starting systems don't count towards encumbrance, but do keep track of that for later.
* Droid quirks (p.18, *Scav's Guide*) are not required, but encouraged.
* I will allow Force Sensitive (non-droid) characters, but remember the setting - this is after Order 66 and the Jedi Purge, and all that implies.

**Background:**
On a Galactic Alliance planet that he didn't even know the name of, his Clan was contracted out to hold a facility while GA military evacuated personnel and civilians. Why the civilians were there Wes had no idea. They should not have been in the middle of a war zone. Something about scientists but Wes had no use for scientists.
Communications were out. Ionization in the atmosphere drastically reduced the range of communications. Wes was holding position watching for any Vong. The optics in his helmet provided him with excellent visibility in the near dark area.
"Buir, you think the Vongese will come this way." Wes said to his Father over the helmet comms.
Buir = father / Vongese = Vong
His father didn't say anything. All Wes saw was the nod of the helmet his father wore.
The other armored warrior in the room spoke. Wes heard her voice over his helmet comms. "Let them come. Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amu." Wes smiled though no one saw it. For his mother spoke the truth. For even through they were only three. Three Mandolorian warriors were equal to a platoon of GA troopers.
Ib'tuur jatne tuur ash'ad kyr'amur = Today is a good day for someone else to die.
Wes shifted the environmental controls that regulated his armor kicked on. Providing cooled air to offset the hot environment outside.
"Ad'ika, run the perimeter." He heard his father say. Wes clicked his comm. to signal that he heard and understood.
Ad'ika = lad, boy
Wes ran the outlying perimeter. At the extreme range of his comlink, where he could still barely reach his parents due to the diminished signal, he got the call they the Vongese were advancing on his parent's position. Wes commed for help relaying the position of the attacking force to the GA personnel. And with best possible speed made his way back. He hadn't gone more than ten feet when the first thud bug hit his helmet. His armor, which was his life, protected him from that hit and the others at followed.
His blaster carbine answered back. His first shot took the lead Vongese in the head and the warrior fell forward head first into the soil. The dust cloud, that the body's impact raised, was quickly swept away buy the warriors second and third companions as they rushed past their fallen comrade.
Wes gave them credit. Most would have paused from seeing that but the Vongese were warriors like him. He had a fight on his hands. The smile beneath his helmet, if the Vongese could have seen it, would have given them pause.
The battle between them raged. Wes tried to contact the others but his comm. fizzled out due to the ionization or damage. The second warrior dropped to several shots but the last was in close now. Amphistaff and armor collided. The living weapon continually tried to find a way past the dense Mando armor.
Wes managed to finally get an armored hand around the warrior's neck. Through repeated bludgeoning with the other hand the Vongese finally lay still. Wes rolled off the dead body. His black and gray armor was covered with his enemys blood.
Standing he made his way back to the position his parents were holding. The sound of battle could still be heard. Quickening his pace even more he arrived on scene. The place was crawling with GA troopers and Vongese in a pitched battle. Seeing the intense melee Wes entered it his blaster carbine firing away. He went through his remaining power packs. By the time the last Vongese dropped Wes was nearly out of ammunition.
The adrenaline of battle still surged within him as he looked for his parents. What shocked him was that they were nowhere to be seen. What he saw when he did find them nearly made the battle hardened Mando retch. His father lay dead fallen over the still body of his mother. Both had pieces of armor missing. Part of his father's breastplate was mission and his mother's helmet was off. Her cause of death was obvious, massive trauma to the head. Around them lay more than a dozen dead Vongese warriors, a testament to their courage in battle.
When all was said and done, payment was received Wes left the planet with his parents. He took them home to Mandalore where they received a warriors funeral.
The war was soon over. With noting to keep him on Mandalore he left. He felt as if he didn't belong there with his clanmates. Not then, maybe never.
-----------------------------------
It didn't take long for Wes to find a job. Some old human on a back water planet needed some help dealing with some pirates that had been harassing him for several months. It seemed to be an easy enough job. Kill a few pirates make some credits to afford a few more modifications to his armor. Then move on to the next job. It all changed when he arrived and talked to the old man.
"Thank you for coming Mr. Del-Fin. The job I requested you for is most important." The man seemed almost too old to be living. Something about the man was unnerving though. As if he didn't need help in dealing with any trouble that may come his way.
Wes simply stood there all the old man could see was his own reflection off the armored helmet. "Yes I know you've been bothered by some pirates. I know how to deal with them." He moved the blaster carbine that always at his side.
The old man smiled. "Yes I am sure that you do. But I have seen something that is disturbing. Something in the future that will come to pass, help there you can. You have an ability that is as of yet unrecognized...they will need you."
As the man spoke a ominous shiver ran down Wes's spine. *What in karking hell is he talking about? He's daft.* Wes thought as he took a step back. Something he had never done to another person before. The old man continued.
"Yes you will be needed." Sensing some sort of danger Wes began to raise his carbine. But the old man moved quicker. If his eyes were visible disbelief would have been seen in his eyes. Wes felt himself begin to loose consciousness. Fighting against it he stumbled to a table in the sparse room. Unable to fight it any longer he slumped over the table. The weight of the man and the armor crushed the table and he fell to the floor.
The old man shuffled up to the fallen Mando a look of grim sadness on his face. "I am sorry my young friend. If things were different I would have trained you myself. Now someone else will have to find that potential that you hold. But alas that will be many years from now.
Wes was removed from his armor and taken to the lower levels of the old mans dwelling. He was placed carefully in a chamber. "Here you will sleep for the next century young Wes. When you awaken you will be needed. Live up to your heritage and your destiny and become a Jedi."
-------------------------------
With the arrival of the No chance on Solsis IIV the group thought they had found a place to lay low and effect repairs on ship that had just been acquired by the pirate Kurr. As the injured Wes took refuge in the hospital as he recovered from his ordeals after being revived from hibernation, the Sith assassin fron the Wheel tracked the ship to the planet and subsequently to the sanctuary of the hospital. During the night, the Sith Assassin with the help of the local Sith governor attacked the hospital in search of Wes and the oboulette the Mandalorian warrior had been confined in for centuries. The Hobben leaders, hiding in the catacombs of the temple turned hospital managed to escape into the vast jungles of Solsis with the obilette and the crew of the No Chance, Jakira, and any straggling Hobben they managed to find.
The group spent the next week hiding in the hazardous jungles, dodging Sith and the fauna equally. Taking refuge in the grove of sacred San'ati, the Force Senstive Hobben leaders made their stand, forming the Pure Song, their spirits combined in the Force and with their combined strength was able to overcome the Sith assassin. Sacrificing themselves, most of the Hobben Elders passed into the Force. With their recent adversary defeated, the crew of the No Chance fights their way past the remaining Sith garrison under the leadership of Governor Radge Rothke. Now hunted by the Sith governor on his own vendetta, the group leaves the planet that had hoped to find a little bit of sanctuary on.
**Personality:**
Wes is a loner Mandalorian to the core. Since the death of his parents he hasn't worked with anyone else. Their death hit him hard as he blames himself. He should have been there. His loyalty to the paying client is never in question. As long as they pay he will work. Credits are credits.
**Appearance:**
Wes is almost always in his armor. The black, gray and red tones are colors of the Del-Fin clan, which he wears proudly. At almost 6'4" in his armor he poses an intimidating figure. The blaster carbine, which is always in hand, further impresses the picture of the Mandalorian warrior. Under the armor one would find a man a few inches shorter then the armored one. Short brown hair and matching brown eyes that are difficult to read. His skin tone is relatively light due to wearing the armor most of the time.
