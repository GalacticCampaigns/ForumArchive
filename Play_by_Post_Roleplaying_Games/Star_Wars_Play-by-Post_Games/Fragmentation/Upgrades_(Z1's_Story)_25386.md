# Upgrades (Z1's Story)

### **BWS2K** (2013-08-24 21:15:46)

Ever since the Emperor had taken power, irradicating the treacherous Jedi Order throughout the galaxy, business for mercenaries had been booming. Unfortunately, it was also a pretty crowded occupation by now, and contracts were usually grabbed within minutes of being posted. Joining the Guild was one popular way of securing work, but it wasn't the *only* way. There were always shadow brokers, buying contracts and then re-posting them at a markup for "preferred customers". Mostly this meant whoever was willing to take the biggest pay cut and still get the job done. It wasn't exactly illegal but, as is usual for the majority of clientele, these brokers could typically only be found in the dirtiest places, farthest from any semblance of the law. Violence was a normal pre-requisite to establishing a relationship with some, others preferred to take the full cut of the first contract to ensure future business. This sort of practice attracted only the most desparate or die-hard mercenaries. Either way, business was thriving for one broker in particular operating out of a backroom in *The Binary Sisters' Pub Of Love* in orbit around Coruscant.
"**So thassit then. Ah'd ask if ya had any questions, butchya don't. Neva do.**"
The rotund Gran slid back into his chair behind the counter, used to working with all manner of "soldiers of fortune" and feeling superior to each and every one of them. They all needed work, at the end of the day, and not many were known for their administrative capabilities. That's where Silas Crax came in. He made it his business to know all about the best bounties and contracts, marking them up for a suitable finder's fee to those looking for a little extra pocket change. Most weren't in the Guild and so were at his mercy about selection and rates.
"**Ya know,**" Silas began, leaning back in the seat, "**Ah just can't fig'r why anyone'd want a droid in charge of somethin' like this. Not reliable, no sir, not in mah opinyun.**" It was a view he was known for, but due more to his ability at persuading and extorting flesh and blood easier than steel. The feelings were mutual. "**'Course in this case, it makes a bit'a sense I s'pose.**"
The contract was simple: Two droids, missing for over a decade, to be returned to a Mos Eisley address in more or less proper working order. Five thousand credits apiece. There was the usual addendum of details after the initial description, and then two holos of the subjects. Beneath one was an alias: Jason Drexler.

Z1 never did care much fore politics for two reasons. First one was because they hardly ever effected droids and the second one was much simpler, he wasn't programed to. While he might not have cared about who was in power it was nice that there was so much work. Like everything though it was a double edged sword. There were a lot of new faces, weak fleshy creatures taking work away from him. He never did understand why he was so looked down on. Logicly droids were better bounty hunters. They didn't need to sleep, they never got drunk or distracted by female showing off their skin, didn't get drunk, and something small like losing a limb didn't slow them down one bit. So that fact the this man was belittling him yet again made his logic circuits short.
As he looked over the bounties he looked at the alias, was this droid trying to live as a person? Why would it do that? If it needed to hide it could simply change out its parts until no one recognised it, but why take on the life of one of these untrusting weaklings. Silas was a perfect example in Z1's mind. Looking up from the data pad his red eyes almost seemed to be glowing a bit brighter. **"I guess it's a good thing that you are not paid for your opinion then Silas. As I have stated many times. Droids are superior 80% of the time when it comes to performing any given task. More so in the case of a droid such as myself."** That was how their conversations normally went. Information was exchanged along with a few less then positive comments. He never did ask for additional informations for a few reasons. The main two were he didn't trust the man and he figured giving more information would be a good excuse for his to tack on more fees.
Z1 turned and walked out without another word pulling the cloak up over his head as he slipped the datapad into his bandolier. He wanted to leave this place as soon as he could. Everything that he disliked about people was amplified here, but he would have to find a ride off this place. Once he completed this mission he would almost have enough for his own ship then he could truly do business as he saw fit. Now was not the time to dwell on what has yet to happen though. He needed to find this Jason Drexler first. Just thinking about it made his circuits ready to overload. A droid being anything but a droid, well they didn't say it had to be all in one piece. As he continued walking he looked around trying to find the quickest was off this floating hell.

Like so many similar facilities, *The Binary Sisters* was part of a station that had a small landing bay for private craft and another for shuttling down the planet or to another orbital location. A modest fee was assessed based on destination, of course. Banks of terminals with Holonet access lined the corridors coming in from the bay and leading to a number of the smaller cafes and merchants' quarter. A lot of business went on up here, and most of it probably beyond illegal, and so there were always less obvious ways of finding people - and transportation - for anyone creative enough.

So you might want to throw in a **Gather Information** roll at some point to help you find Jason Drexler, and we'll play out the "price" for a ship/taxi when you're there. Please go ahead and move your character sheet (or the link to it) in the File Folders thread when you get a chance.

Z1 looked around as he thought about the two targets he had to bring in. This Jason really pissed him off and would be the first one to go down. Luckily for him had was not tole they had to be one piece. He walked over to a computer terminal as he tried to figure out what his first move should be. He figured he would gather some data on who this droid was then he would have to ask around to see if he could get any leads. As the scomp link folded out of his arm and plugged into the computer he started looking for any public records about Jason Drexler. He wanted to see if he was a pilot, merc, or just a nobody so he would know where to ask about him. Although the thought of asking others for information always irritated him. Most people wouldn't give him the time of day. Then again most people didn't know that he had his behavioral inhibitors deactivated and could kill them just for the hell of it.

The search began in a routine fashion - tediously narrowing down criteria and collating accounts. The name Jason Drexler turned up most in the underground shockboxing circuit, but that was on Corellia fifteen years ago. Details aren't clear about what happened next and his last known location was on Tatooine. The bounty was first posted then, and was first offered by none other than the well-known Jabba the Hutt. The other droid, apparently going by the name "Sera", turned up even less information. As far as facts go, this was going to be tricky.
As luck would have it however, due to his fame and reputation in the ring, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding his disappearance, Jason Drexler has a modest group of devoted followers on the Holonet. They call themselves "*KO-fans*" after Jason's famous finishing move, and they've loads of entries of purported "*Drexler sightings*". Some are obviously bunk, some less so. After spending some time filtering through the reports and cross-checking with local news and law enforcement accounts, Jason Drexler and his companion were last seen in the droid fighting pits of Raxus Prime. He's used a number of aliases but there's no fooling a KO-fan.
Probably.

It took me a little while because I wanted to make your natural twenty (your first roll on the site?!) count for something extra. Turns out this guys got a decent fanbase - maybe even a stalker or two - that might be of use to Z1. Happy gaming!

Z1 scanned through the data and pulled out what would be useful. The KO-fans would be his best lead. That fact that he was a shock boxer would make things very interesting. Z1 had been trained to specialize CQC and his weapons reflected that. The large Dire sword on his back always drew attention. Most people wondered why a droid would use such an archaic weapon. His reasons were simple, most people didn't think anything of it so he could take it anywhere and it would always draw his targets attention away from his other weapons. The double barrel carbine on his side was his favorite to surprise people with. As the scomp link retracted he tucked his arm back under his cloak and looked around for a taxi to the spaceport. He needed to find a ride to Raxus Prime, but this would be one of the times that being a droid would work against him. Most people did want to give a droid, let alone a droid with no owner, a ride. He would figure that out once he found a ship headed that way.

A ride to the docking bay was easy enough to find, passage to Raxus was a little more tricky. There were a number of transports scheduled to leave over the next few hours but none headed directly there. A private supply ship doing its rounds wold reach the junk planet in about three standard days. A Gallofree Yards L4000 transport ship called *Hot Pursuit*, it was owned and operated by an aging Rodian named Speedo who happened to be overseeing the loading of various goods at the moment. Whether he was interested in taking on any passengers, and for what cost, remained to be seen. The next fastest route would be using regular public services on established circuits and would take a little less than seven days at a rate of thirty credits a day berth.
"**Faster you worthless slugs!**" Speedo can be heard shouting at the loading crew, "**If I wanted to pay good rates for slow work I'd have hired Imperials!**"
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

I'll need a **Persuasion** check from you, unless you have a better idea, if you want to talk with Speedo. That's probably a nickname by the way, and probably a joke on many levels among Rodian pilots. ![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)

If Z1 could smile this would be one of the few times he would. This Speedo would be his fastest option and he figured he had a few tricks he could use. The man was in a rush to load on his cargo and that was in Z1's favor. Being a CQC droid who was programed to handle most melee weapons his servos were stronger than most other people. Plus he would need to eat, drink, or rest. He had he plan now it was time to act. As he approached the Rodian he made sure his carbine was loaded and ready after all he still didn't trust anything that needed to breath. Walking up to Speedo he made his presence clear before speaking up "**Pardon me sir, but I noticed your men seem to be performing sub par for your standards. Perhaps a multi-purpose droid would be useful. I am easily as strong as any of them and I will not grow tired. Now before you say anything I know you want to know what the catch is. Simple, I would like a ride to Raxus Prime. I require no food or drink and I can ride in the cargo hold and lastly, upon arrival I can pay you a fee. You have nothing to lose in the deal."
Z1 knew he left some details open but he did that hoping the Rodian would feel in control of this deal. Of course he had no intention of paying him once on Raxus Prime. He would find a good time to jump ship before they landed and then look for his next lead.

The Rodian diverts his attention just long enough for his crew to drop a large container, spilling its chemical contents across the deck. His eyes narrow as he sizes up Z1 and the crew takes advantage of the distraction to try and clean things up as fast as possible - any excuse to not be under the hostile gaze of Speedo.
"**…You sound confident for a droid,**" replies Speedo in perfect Basic. "**I think maybe you're not such a good investment. My crew, such as it is, are greedy and easily bought off - this is how I ensure loyalty. Hmm…**"
Speedo ponders taking on Z1 for a few minutes, occasionally glancing back at his less-than-competent crew. They're working double time now, trying to clean up the spill while still keep pace with loading all the other containers. It's obvious to anyone that these are no experts, and to drive the point home one suddenly slips on the chemical and gets covered in a bright blue oil. He screams as his flesh begins to slowly melt away but the others just ignore him and keep working. Without taking his eyes off the dissolving crew member, Speedo says to Z1: "**I appear to have an opening. We should make Raxus Prime in approximately one hundred and twenty-two hours, if we keep to schedule. Better grab a mop.**"
He walks off towards the landing bay control deck to explain the hazard of an unidentified substance now threatening to eat through the plasteel grating near his ship.

If there's nothing you want to do on the ship (gamble, kill everyone, etc.), then just make a quick post and we'll fast forward to Raxus.

Z1 watched at the rodian spoke *You like your crew greedy and easily bought off? This is why organics do not make an sense. They almost make my logic circuits overload every time I talk to them*. He was about ready to say something before he watched the crewmember slip into the spill. He had to hold back a laugh as he watched their skin melt away. The rodain speaking to him made it a bit easier. As he walked off Z1 eyed the crew "**Yes you do have an opening. It is only a pity I did not cause that opening myself**" he muttered. If he could he would have most the crew terminated by the time the captain returned, just for thinking that Z1 was not a good investment. Unlike organics when Z1 made a business agreement he followed it. That was the only thing saving the captains crew at the moment. Without another word he walked down to the loading area and helped where he could. Once the cargo was loaded he found an quite, well guarded, spot in the cargo bay and backed himself into a corner. As he prepared to power down so that he could recharge he thought about his target one more time. As long as it still functioned he should be able to collect. That meant arms and legs were optional.

Go ahead and just skip to the planet

### **BWS2K** (2013-09-14 21:47:04)

The trip to Raxus was uneventful - at least from the cargo hold. Z1 was allowed to leave *Hot Pursuit* upon landing, as if anyone could have really stopped him, and none to soon for the crew's taste.
The spaceport was in various states of repair - necessary in Raxus' harsh atmosphere - but all the usual services were offered. A small cantina offered refreshments, a few peddlers sold wares along the main corridors, and traders, smugglers, and soldiers went about their business all over. The Empire had a presence here too, but some planets were more important than others and as long as there wasn't any serious trouble it was easy enough to avoid them. All in all, it was about what Z1 could have expected. A quick scan of the local net revealed that there were indeed droid fights run nearly around the clock but finding Drexler without his alias would be difficult. There was one possibi-
"**Hey, watch't, chrome dome!**" muttered a ragged looking man from behind Z1. "**Y'ask me, ya could do with sum manners!**" He was gesturing at a rusty protocol droid who'd been conversing with some astromechs.
"**Apologies, sir, but I do believe there's been a mistake,**" came the reply, "**We were simply trying to-**"
"**Ah, shuttit!**" The man pulled a blaster from his belt and leveled it at the droid.

You're welcome to do what you like, but if you start combat then I need an Initiative roll in a spoiler for your next post. Sorry for the delay!
