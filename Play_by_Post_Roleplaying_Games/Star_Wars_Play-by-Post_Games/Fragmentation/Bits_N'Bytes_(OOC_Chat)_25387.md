Sometimes I think I'll run out of good cantina names, and then I'm like, "**Nope. Never.**" It's good to be gaming again, and I'll have something up for Nadia and Jason (separately) over the next day or two. Krieg - the ultimate goal is to have you guys end up as a party, but you can take your time in getting there. Cheers!

BW, are you going to want us to post our sheets in a thread or just have them sit wherever we put them? (Krieg on google and mine in the Blog)

I knew I forgot something. Hang on, I'll make a tread for character sheets in a minute. Thanks!
Stay tuned - I have some thoughts about Nadia and Jason that I wanted to post here too. <!-- s:idea: -->![:idea:](https://i.ibb.co/DDwQHgHX/icon-idea.gif)<!-- s:idea: -->

For **Jason Drexler**: I'm assuming you're still with Sera, or at least you were until relatively recently, though the nature of your relationship is up to you. We're sort of letting Andy fade into nothingness, so while I think it's alright to include that as part of your background or whatever, I wouldn't do more than mention it. Maybe he'll make a cameo or something, but Jason's big arc has always been about fame, money, and the ladies.
For **Marina**: And by Marina I mean Nadia (after all this time I still slip up with that). Last I knew was she was on deck with Karn and Steel had just knocked out Chayse. I think you should write yourself out of that a bit (or did we do that already?), using the last post in Severed Connections. You just messaged me, so let me go check that... lol
I'll try and have a post up for at least one of you by the end of the day. Nice first post Krieg! <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->

Well I aim to please...most of the time...okay only sometimes. As for the whole party thing, to quote one of my favorite characters "Well... that'll be an interesting day."

BW you may want to change the last paragraph in the sheets thread. It's 15 years after. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Ah, good catch. I know I had changed it somewhere, but my net's spotty today and maybe it didn't take.

Lol - *KO-fans*! I love GMing this stuff. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Sorry I haven't been able to post yet. Boyfriend and I are moving in together so been busy packing our stuff for a big move on Sunday.
I'll be relatively unsupervised at work today so I should be able to get something good out. They're having me write a how to manual today anyways so should be easy. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

Coolness. It's the first day of school today so it's been kinda crazy for me too. The position I'm supposed to be filling is... non-conventional? It's basically monitoring the students using a program like Luminosity but I haven't been trained on it, so until mid-September I think most of my hours are going to be stuck in one of many manuals and watching a lot of webinars. Congrats on the move!

Krieg - when rolling, you can include modifiers in the roll like so:
dice]1d20+13[/dice with brackets becomes...

***22*** <- [9] 1d20 + 13

Haven't forgotten about either of you, it's just been a tiring week. I think I was in bed before ten every night, at least once was at eight. I'll shoot to have something up for you both by the Sunday night. I think jaybee's out globetrotting but I'll double-check to see if he still wants in, and ya'll can start synching up.

Your students running you ragged, BW?
I've had an interesting week.. Got rear-ended on the highway on my way home last monday. I've been having to deal with two insurance companies who can't locate the guy who hit me. Conveniently the guys phone has been disconnected so they're relying on snail mail to get in touch with him. Trying to delay getting my car fixed as I don't have $500 to put up for rental and my deductible.
Learned my lesson in not calling the police while at the scene. At least my car is drive able.. Just not safe.

Glad to hear you're alright! And yes, they are, but in a good way. I'd rather be working with a hundred elementary school kids than a room full of machine operators. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
I've kept your e-mail notification in my inbox so I think about it often, I just haven't had a good chunk of Star Wars time. I was thinking about it on the way home today actually, so we'll see what happens tonight. I have a three-day weekend too, so let's say I'll have something up for you by this time next week, if not sooner. I'd apologize but I think at this point you know I sort of post in cycles. I'm a bipolar play-by-poster. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
