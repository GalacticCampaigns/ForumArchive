# GC Server

### **Alicia** (2011-01-20 17:05:51)

I'm pleased to announce that our community now has its very own server.
As this is hosted from my home computer at the moment, I'm working on providing the stability of the other servers.
If the server is online you will see it listed when you browse the servers (even if it's grayed out).
It may also be accessed by entering the following address: galacticcampaigns.servegame.com:6774
To check the status of the server, please visit the meta server: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/openrpg.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/openrpg.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/openrpg.php")<!-- m -->
This will also be available via the "Resources" tab
Please let me know if you experience any problems.
