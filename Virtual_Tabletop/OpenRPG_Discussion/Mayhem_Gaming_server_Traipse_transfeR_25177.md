> Mayhem Gaming would like to move to a Traipse server by Feb 10 2012. To do this people that game here will need to have all members of their games on a version of Traipse or there are problems with the chat interpretation from OpenRPG client to Traipse server. If you could convert soon it would be greatly appreciated.
