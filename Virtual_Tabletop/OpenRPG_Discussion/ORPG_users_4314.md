I would like to open a discussion for those who use ORPG.
What do you think of the program overall? How does it compare with others that you've used?
What downsides or advantages do you see from its use?
Are there things about the program you still don't understand or wish the devs would improve on?
ETC, ETC

Hmm.. sorry. but what is ORPG, could you give a link or something. Is it free?

It's short for OpenRPG, an open-source online RPG chat program (like IRC, with dice rollers and maps). Check it out at: [http://www.openrpg.com/](http://www.openrpg.com/ "http://www.openrpg.com/") And yeah, it's free.

From what little I did use of it, OpenRPG seemed to have all the features I would need. I wish the nodes were easier to quickly modify, from a character-sheet-making perspective, but admittedly, I didn't devote much time to playing around with it. Granted, there are a number of alternate solutions, but I wouldn't mind using it. Another problem I had was creating a server. This was probably caused by my router, though I do know how to open ports for applications and what not. I ended up using Veav, since it seemed well enough.
Oh, I was using OpenRPG+, btw. I've also played around with Fantasy Grounds, which looks pretty, but I found to be also limiting. Maybe I just like the IRC feel of ORPG.
The one feature I haven't tried out, but want to, would be the map whiteboard. How well does it accept and adapt user-created maps? Last I heard, moving tokens was broken and shadowing or "fog-of-war" was also glitchy.

I' usually use maps in my sessions and while the miniature set up took a little getting used to its not very hard to use. My one qualm is I would sometimes not see when a player would move the mini so would not realize where they had moved from or if they had at all.
The fog seems ineffective IMO. I've tried it, and unless I'm using it wrong, it fills the players screen so they can't see the map. It would be nice if they made so you could just hide portions of a map in the instances you are using a user created one.
As far as using user created maps, I've found they load faster when pulling them from a website, especially when you wish to save them as an XML with all minis, whiteboard lines and any other preferences (like grid size). The same with minis.
I've tried to make a couple character sheets for saga only to be limited by my programming knowledge. I use a simple Macro node where each macro has to modified individually (A hassle when you level up).

The fog features is supposed to cover the screen at first, until you start to reveal portions of the map by drawing shapes over it. Are you saying it failed to reveal these portions to the players when you used it? I guess it wouldn't be too incredibly useful in Star Wars, but it would be a necessity in D&D, where dark dungeons are the norm.

I haven't been able to figure out how that works then. I can get it to cover the screen but not to reveal as the area is explored.
Edit: i finally figured it out.

Things I can see that need improving. There ought to be a way to import characters. It would be nice if the character nodes looked more like character sheets. It would be nice if it included some way to send audiofx and have some sort of audio chat function. voicemodulation would be cool too. Imagine the GM being able to change their voice for different characters.
