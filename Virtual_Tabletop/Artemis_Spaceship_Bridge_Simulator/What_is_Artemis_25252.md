# What is Artemis?

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Artemis is a multiplayer, multi-computer networked game for Windows computers.
Artemis simulates a spaceship bridge by networking several computers together. One computer runs the simulation and the &quot;main screen&quot;, while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do, like Helm, Communication, Engineering, and Weapon Control.
Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room (&quot;bridge&quot;) , and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain, a person who sits in the middle, doesn&#39;t have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.
Artemis is a software game for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.</span>

<details><summary>▶ Q: What are the system requirements? How good does my computer have to be?:1g8mhibh</summary>

A: Well, I WOULD say that any DirectX 9 computer should be able to run it. BUT, I've had people say now that their old machines 1) have DirectX 9 and 2) can't start the game. That's probably true. The engine assumes some things like 24-bits of color and a 16-bit Z-buffer, plus basic hardware shaders (Shader Model 2.0).
However, finding out if your machine does all that and more is a waste of time. The demo is free and small. [Download it and try it](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/download/Artemis_demo_v1_40_2.exe:1g8mhibh "http://www.artemis.eochu.com/download/Artemis_demo_v1_40_2.exe:1g8mhibh"). If it doesn't work, then it doesn't work.

<details><summary>▶ Q: Why is Artemis only for Windows computers?:1g8mhibh</summary>

A: Fans on the forums have been able to play Artemis on Macs using [Wineskin](http://wineskin.doh123.com/Information.html:1g8mhibh "http://wineskin.doh123.com/Information.html:1g8mhibh"). Unix guys have also had luck using Wine 1.3.
