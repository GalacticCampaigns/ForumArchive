# GC: Artemis (next run Aug 12, 5pm EDT)

### **Alicia** (2012-07-03 18:41:23)

I would like to run this on a Sunday on a semi regular basis (once to twice a month) and access to a VOIP such as Teamspeak 3 or Skype is required. Communication in this game is key to success and VOIP allows for such.
A full copy of the game will be provided to those serious about participating.

We had a blast today and thankfully we were able to experience the game with a full crew!
After a couple Invasion missions going up to level 5 we played the Mission The Waning Dark where the crew of the *GC Artemis* was able to successfully scan the necessary nebulae and hold off an impending invasion force hiding within.
The following personnel were on active assignment for the run
**Helm** Jade (Jade Criminal)
**Weapons** Duggs
**Engineering** Fraser (Frascoid)
**Science** Brandon (clarison608)
**Comms** Joseph (Ubersaint)
**Captain** Alicia
Please check your availability for our next run on July 29th.

I can't do it on the 29th. That is my birthday and I will be at Mayhem Fest all day.

Ok, I still like Engineering, so I'll continue with that unless someone else wants to give it a try. Still good for sunday, just have to check if I'm working or not so I know if I need to take the day off. See you on the bridge!

Our next meeting is scheduled for Aug 12, 5pm EDT. I hope this later time will work better for some of you.

### **fraszoid** (2012-08-09 14:19:36)

I can make that time. Can't wait to fly again! Also, there is a new site for organizing crews and coop missions: <!-- m -->[http://tsn.eochu.com/](http://tsn.eochu.com/ "http://tsn.eochu.com/")<!-- m --> might it be worth signing up our crew there too?

Hey, next time you do an Artemis game, I'd be interested in joining in. Never played it, looking to find someone to hook me up with a demo run for now, haven't bought the game.
Since I'm a newb, I'll play any station, but probably would prefer something a little more active than Comms. I would survive with comms, though.

Thanks

I found a new crew, 3 plus me (<!-- m -->[http://www.artemis.eochu.com/?page_id=2 &#8230; p-1881374/](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/?page_id=28#/20120902/looking-for-a-group-1881374/ "http://www.artemis.eochu.com/?page_id=28#/20120902/looking-for-a-group-1881374/")<!-- m -->)
If anyone is interested in joining, we are looking to play saturday evenings and can always use more people. I'm the one hosting the games, and unofficial captain (of 3 games I was running captain and engineering on 2). Roles are flexible too. I'm hoping to rekindle interest among everyone, I had a lot of fun with you all, and I would very much like to play with you all some more. I'll try to post our dates here too so you can join in if you desire.
