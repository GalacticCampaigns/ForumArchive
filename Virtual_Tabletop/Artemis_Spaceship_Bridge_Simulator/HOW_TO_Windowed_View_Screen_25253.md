# HOW TO: Windowed View Screen

### **Alicia** (2012-07-06 11:58:51)

Since we aren't running in one room, not everyone will get to see a view screen during play. Thanks to a fellow player on the Artemis forums, we have a solution to counter this.

**Instructions**
Download [<strong>AutoHotKey</strong>](http://www.autohotkey.com/ "http://www.autohotkey.com/")
Use the Artemis Script and hot keys found [here](http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/ "http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/").
**To Create the Script**

1. Right-click an empty spot on your desktop or in a folder of your choice.
2. In the menu that appears, select New -> AutoHotkey Script. (Alternatively, select New -> Text Document.)
3. Type a name for the file, ensuring that it ends in .ahk. For example: Artemis.ahk
4. Right-click the file and choose Edit Script.
5. On a blank line, copy and paste the script found [here](http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/ "http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/").
6. Save the file, preferably on the desktop.
7. Close Editor

Once open, the script will appear on your taskbar running in the background and you may pause or close it at will here. You can run as many scripts as you want, each appearing as their own icon on the taskbar.
You can download a copy of the script in text and .exe form [here](http://arkgeeks.com/files/artemis/AHK_20120706.zip "http://arkgeeks.com/files/artemis/AHK_20120706.zip")
**Using the script to create a MAIN SCREEN (view screen)**

1. Open an instance of Artemis at size *800x600* in *windowed* mode. (An instance is considered to be a new window which is controlled separately from others.) The first instance will become the view screen while the second will be the game play window
2. Connect to server and select MAIN SCREEN
3. Click Ready to Play
4. Set the size of this window to your preferred small size (The smallest is CTRL+C [sets to 320x240])
5. Open your second instance to your preferred resolution in windowed mode preferably one setting smaller than your desktop resolution
6. Use ALT+TAB till you've selected your Main Screen window
7. Move the window to your desired location (You may encounter an error relating to the D3D device. Hit ok and ignore it)
8. With the Main Screen window selected hit CTRL+A to toggle it always on top
9. Additionally you can set it to be Transparent (CTRL+T) or to Opaque (CTRL+ALT+T)
