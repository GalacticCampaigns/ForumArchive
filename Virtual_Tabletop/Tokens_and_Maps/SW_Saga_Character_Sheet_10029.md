# SW Saga Character Sheet

### **Alicia** (2008-04-10 23:11:13)

I posted this on the OpenRPG forum and thought I would here as well.
This is the sheet I use for my characters and a variant of it for my NPCs, which I can provide if someone is interested.
**How to add to OpenRPG:**
You can right click the link and "save link as", selecting a place to download the .xml to. Yo would then right click where your gametree and select the first option to "Insert File."
A second way would be to right click the link and "copy link location", importing it to the gametree as a URL (2nd option when right clicking in the gametree area; "Insert URL".)

I don't think this link works anymore, I tried using it to obtain the file, but when I try to import the file into my gametree, it says Import Failed: Invalid or Missing Node Data.

I'll re upload it when I get home. It's probably here though. [http://swrpgrc.com/files](http://swrpgrc.com/files "http://swrpgrc.com/files") under the OpenRPG resources.
