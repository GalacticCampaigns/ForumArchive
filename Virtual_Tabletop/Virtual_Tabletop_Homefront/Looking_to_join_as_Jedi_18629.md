# Looking to join as Jedi

### **Akisa** (2008-10-03 15:32:13)

I'm looking to join campaign as a Jedi and available any time in the afternoon. For settings like the darktimes or the rebellion I can play a force user who has found a holocroon and a Lightsaber.

I may be putting together a Rebellion campaign...but don't take that as a promise. If I do I'll contact you.

Just a suggestion, since we actually have a ORPG game that is looking for players at he moment, why don´t you look into that? It has some restrictions on characters, but I´m pretty sure you could build a character that fits those and is still a Jedi. Or you could just ask the GM if he might make an exception, or if you can work something out.
My guess is that that would be about a million times more effective for you than coming in here like a few times a year and just posting that you are looking for a game...take a look in the casting calls section, where GMs go to look for players <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
