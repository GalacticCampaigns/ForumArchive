### **Anonymous** (2011-01-12 02:03:22)

ty for stopping to read this. ive been "D'ing" for about the past 6 years, everything from basic all the way up to 3.5, i got the 3.5 books sitting right here on my desk but am primarily looking for a Sw Saga game, been aching to be a player and not a Friggin GM lol. only got the core rulebook and a few other downloaded odds and ends. anyways, mature player, play for the love of the game, and love trying to outsmart my Dm or GM in game. can bend schedule to fit almost ne campaign as i am not working at this moment in time. hit me up if neone has a slot to fill. have a good one.
