Welcome to our virtual tabletop homefront. This forum is a where GMs can create their own threads for use in hosting their campaigns. This forum will also be used for recruiting purposes.
These threads are great for coordinating games and keeping each other updated on events. GMs can also use the thread for posting game summaries, storing character sheets (user's blog is another great place), or for any other creative uses relevant to their campaign.
Please keep the following in mind when using this forum:

1. Guests are allowed to post in this forum, but not in the listed subforums reserved for GMs and their players. All users of this site are encouraged to register to take advantage of all of our features.
2. GMs are restricted to one thread per game. GMs are welcome to [request a subforum](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=151 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=151") for their use where they may create as many threads as the wish relevant to their campaign.
3. When posting a new thread, GMs should include the system in [ ] followed by the campaign name. IE, [SW Saga] Dawn of Defiance
