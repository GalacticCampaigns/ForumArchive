</div>

We open some months after the rise of the Empire, with the Clone Wars a very recent and vivid memory for most beings in the galaxy. The Empire has begun tightening its grip on star systems throughout the galaxy, and Darth Vader stands at the newly declared Emperor’s right hand, crushing any opposition and hunting down the last remnants of the Jedi Order. In these short months since the fall of the Republic, many have joined the Empire willingly, including the Core Worlds whose Human nobles stand to benefit a great deal from its tyranny. Similarly, many others have begun rebelling against Imperial oppression, finding themselves driven out of their homes (or worse) and forced to live in a galaxy that tolerates no opposition to the Empire. Throughout, the heroes must deal with the reality that the Empire is a monolithic threat without any kind of organized opposition, and dealing with agents of the Empire can be dangerous.
Certain kinds of heroes will find it easier than others to flourish. First and foremost, the heroes should view the Empire as both a threat and an enemy. As the major villainous entity of the campaign, the Empire represents something that is to be feared and loathed, and characters with Imperial sympathies will likely find themselves in conflict with the overarching plot. Otherwise, the heroes can come from almost any background and profession. As long as they are willing to fight against the Empire (both covertly and openly), they should find the story engaging and exciting. Not every hero needs to be an idealistic freedom fighter; smugglers, bounty hunters, and free traders have just as much to gain from weakening the Empire as rebellious troops do.
> **Edit:**
>
> We are starting assuming the heroes do not know one another before the adventure begins, it will be beneficial to decide in advance what has brought each hero to Sel Zonn Station. They might be criminals escaping justice on Brentaal, fugitive Jedi on the run from the Empire, legitimate traders or business people passing through, or nobles who have traveled to Brentaal to investigate their financial interests. If a couple heroes wish to get together and decide they already know one another, they could have simply come to the station for the same reason as many other travelers—to rest, relax, refuel, and prepare for the next leg of their journey.

**Note**: While **Dawn of Defiance** is a campaign of 10 modules I will only be running the first module as a demo for a group of players learning the Saga Edition system.

## Regulations

### **Alicia** (2012-02-18 20:29:24)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**House Rules**</span>

* Block/Deflect can be used against a critical to take normal damage. The Use the Force check must meet or beat the total attack roll.
* When using Force powers which requires a standard action or full-round action in combat; allies of the target, if adjacent, may make an Attack of Opportunity against the Force user if one has not been take already by the ally that round. The target, however, may not make an Attack of Opportunity against the Force user.

*Example*: If Jedi Knight Juda Lurn attempted to use Force Grip on a Captain of the Guard (who is 4 squares away) while Juda was flanked by two of the guards, both guards would get an AoO on the Jedi. However, if Juda attempted to Force Grip one of the two guards, the other guard would get an AoO, but the victim of the Force Grip would not.
* Since ammo is not being kept track of, use the following rule instead: When a natural 1 is rolled on an attack roll when using a weapon which contains a power cell or pack, then the weapon has become jammed or shorts out and the power source must be replaced as a move action next round. This also includes any melee weapon, only lightsabers do not need a replacement. Instead it takes two swift actions next round to readjust the power settings and turn it back on.
It is thus assumed that during down time a character has recharged his power pack or energy cell, or replaced a used one.* **Retraining:**(Notify GM when retraining and my be subject to scrutiny; in character reason for Retraining will be needed/requested)
Sometimes you make decisions when you create or advance your character that you later regret. Perhaps a talent you chose isn't working with your character concept, or a feat never comes into play the way you anticipated.
Every time you gain a level, you can retrain your character: change one feat, talent, or skill selection you made previously. You can make only one change at each level.

  **Feat:** You can replace a feat with another feat. You must meet the prerequisites of the new feat. You can’t replace a feat if it’s a prerequisite for any other attribute you have. If you choose to replace a feat you gained as a class bonus, you must replace it with a feat from the bonus feat list for that class.
  **Talent:** You can replace a talent with another talent from the same class. You must meet any prerequisites for that talent and you can't replace the talent of it is a prerequisite for another attribute.
  **Skill:** You can replace a trained skill with another trained skill from your class list. You can’t replace a skill if it’s required for any other attribute you have.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Rules Changes**:</span>
(These rules will be changed if they become an issue)

* When multiclassing, if going from one class to another that uses the 3/4th BAB scale, you do not have to start over. BAB for such levels is treated as total character levels with 3/4th BAB.
* **Climb, Swim and Jump** now fall under the ***Athletics** (Str)* skill. Athletics is a class skill for: Jedi, Soldiers, and Scouts
* **Armored Defense and Improved Armored Defense** are now under one talent of ***Armored Defense Mastery*** and is accessible to Soldiers as normal. The Imperial Knight Talent Armor Mastery is now null.
* **Battle Meditation and Improved Meditation** are combined under the name ***Battle Medititation***.
* **Block and Deflect** are now combined into one talent called ***Defend***. Take cumulative penalty for each block and deflect action. Talents such as Riposte and Redirect Shot are still taken individually.
* **Riposte** (KotOR p25) - As a reaction once per round instead of once per encounter.
* **Improved Riposte and Improved Redirect** (KotOR p39) - Once per encounter not once per turn
**Unleashed** (FU p35 & 37) - Unleashed abilities maybe used by anyone who has a destiny. It however costs:

  1 Destiny point (as normal)
  Move 1 persistent step down the Condition Track (this is negated by taking the feat Unleashed)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">The Dark Side and Transgressions </span>
Everyone will be treated the same when it comes to the Dark Side whether you are Force Sensitive or not.
This check list will be used to determine what transgression category an act falls under:
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Jedi Counseling 111</span>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Atonement Ain't Easy
**Q: Atonement seems too easy. It's common to have Force Points left over upon gaining a level. Since they would be lost anyway, couldn't you spend them on atonement, effectively reducing your Dark Side Score for no real cost?**
A: Atonement isn't quite that simple. It requires "a period of meditation, reflection, and absolution" on the part of the character, so it isn't a quick or instantaneous process. First, the player declares that his character is attempting to atone, spending 1 Force Point as a swift action; this represents the character pausing as she realizes that she is walking down the wrong path.
Next, the Gamemaster decides how to adjudicate the attempt to atone, such as how long it will take, whether any special acts of contrition will be required, and so forth. If performed "on stage," it should span at least the length of an adventure (during which the hero is essentially a total saint). If performed between adventures, it will normally require at least a week and possibly as long as months (even years!) of sincere reflection. The precise time and effort required should usually reflect the character's transgressions, so someone with a very high Dark Side Score may have to meet a higher standard to prove that the atonement is sincere.
The GM also adjudicates when the attempt is successful. If the hero's actions don't reflect a sincere desire to atone, her Dark Side Score won't be reduced. Still, the details are up to the GM, and atonement should never interfere with the needs of the campaign.
One last detail here: You can atone only 1 point at a time. This means that you can't spend all your leftover Force Points just before you gain a level. You could start a period of atonement, certainly, but it wouldn't end for quite some time (as described above).
________________________________________
**Q: If you have Force Point Recovery and you atone to reduce your Dark Side Score, do you get the Force Point back?**
A: No. Force Points that you sacrifice for atonement are permanently lost and cannot be recovered by any means.
________________________________________
**Q: I'm having some problems deciding what type of transgression some actions should be. How can you tell when something is blatantly evil (a major transgression), questionably evil (a moderate transgression), or dubiously evil (a minor transgression)?**
A: While the precise divisions are ultimately up to the GM, enforcing them as loosely or tightly as appropriate for the campaign, here are some guidelines to help you decide on corner cases. To decide if an action is "blatantly evil," ask yourself the following questions:
• Did the action harm a sentient, living character?
• Did the action harm a character that was at your mercy (helpless, unable to meaningfully defend itself, or something similar)?
• Did the action cause serious harm to a character (physically, mentally, or emotionally)?
• Was the action unnecessary to protect yourself or another character from an immediate, obvious threat?
• Was the action deliberate and the result intended?
If the answer to all of these questions is "Yes," then the action is almost certainly "blatantly evil" (a major transgression) and deserves increasing the character's Dark Side Score. Examples include murder, torture (including acts such as intentional mutilation or maiming), slavery, rape, and any similar act considered reprehensible by most civilizations.
If exactly one question can be answered "No," then the action is probably "questionably evil" (a moderate transgression), which might be worth increasing the character's Dark Side Score. Examples include assassinating an Imperial warlord who is about to give orders to exterminate the population of a planet (it's in defense of others, but he's still at your mercy), tormenting a droid to extract information, or starting an unnecessary fight that results in serious injury.
If exactly two of the questions can be answered "No," then the action is probably "dubiously evil" (a minor transgression) and likely doesn't deserve increasing the character's Dark Side Score. Examples include killing in self-defense or recklessly (but accidentally) causing injury to others.
If three or more questions can be answered "No," then the action probably is not a dark side transgression at all. For example, destroying an object is not a transgression unless doing so also causes some sort of substantial harm to a character. Similarly, hunting an animal (not sentient) in the wilderness (not helpless) for sustenance (protecting yourself from starvation) is perfectly acceptable in all but the most unusual circumstances.
Obviously, you'll still need to interpret the situation accordingly. How strictly do you want to define "harm"? For example, is a rich character harmed in a significant way by having a minor treasure stolen? Is a threat imminent and real, or is the character merely trying to justify unnecessary aggression? The purpose of these questions isn't to give you a never-fail method but to help you evaluate an action. When in doubt, go with your gut instinct. The more you have to parse and explain an action to make it acceptable, the more likely it is to be a transgression.
________________________________________
**Q: Would Severing Strike be a major transgression? It seems that you'd never learn this talent unless you intended to maim others.**
A: No, Severing Strike, in itself, is not a transgression because it is designed to protect your target from an otherwise lethal blow. The same would be true for a doctor who has to perform a medical amputation. Although the act is "maiming" in the strictest sense, it is only to protect the target from a more dangerous medical problem.
This doesn't mean that Severing Strike can't be used in a blatantly evil way, of course. Cutting off the limbs of an enemy who is at your mercy would still be tantamount to torture no matter how you do it (by lightsaber, scalpel, or angry Wookiee).
________________________________________
**Q: What happens if you use move object against a door? How about Force thrust?**
A: If you use move object against a door, you deal normal damage to it as the door strains against its frame. (Don't forget to apply the effects of the door's damage reduction.) If the damage is sufficient to reduce the door to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled and the door is pulled free, making the doorway passable.
If you use Force thrust against a door, compare your Use the Force check result to the door's break DC. If successful, you have forced the door open. If not, the door remains intact and functional.
For those who are interested, an object's break DC is calculated as if it were a character resisting a bantha rush or Force thrust. Take its Strength bonus, add 10 (the average result on a roll of 1d20, rounded down), and -- in most cases -- add 5 more for being exceptionally stable. (Some particularly fragile objects may deviate on this last detail, but that is fairly rare.)

</details>

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Major Trangressions</span> DSP Guaranteed
**Performing a blatantly evil act** such as deliberately killing or injuring another creature who hasn't done anything wrong or who honestly seeks redemption for evil acts performed in the past.
**Using a Force Power with the [dark side] descriptor** 
**Using the Force in anger** 
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Moderate Transgressions</span> DSP based on action and at the GM's discretion.
**Using the Force to cause undue harm** 
**Performing a questionably evil act** such as killing (or allowing) a helpless opponent, even if the opponent has committed evil acts without remorse.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Minor Transgressions</span> These probably will not increase your DSS unless the GM feels there is good reason to make an exception.
**Performing a dubiously evil act** such as killing an opponent in combat while ignoring opportunities to end the situation without the loss of lige, though a specific situation might not be so clear cut.

## Character Creation

### **Alicia** (2012-02-26 15:40:03)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Character Creation**</span>

* 32 point buy for stats (does not include racial changes)
* Level 1 (be aware this game will cover levels 1-3)
* Max HP for level
* **credits** = max starting of first level
* **Books to use** any, I ask when writing out the stat block you make a list somewhere of where the non-core references are coming from. This includes equipment.
* **Races** Era specific. Make sure to look in the Wookiepedia to see if they were actually around during this time. If I see they aren't then the character will be denied.
* Detailed, well written background and description required.

Please keep in mind this is the Rise of the Empire era. If something doesn't belong it will be denied.
Also required will be a level breakdown to be included on the sheets (at the bottom of the sheet or in notes section).

```
[b][size=125]Level 1:[/size] class 1;[/b] Str 8, Dex 8, Con 8, Int 8, Wis 8, Cha 8
[list][b]Talents[/b] *
[b]Feats[/b] *
[b]Skills[/b] *
[b]Force Powers Known[/b] *[/list]
```

<details><summary>Example Level Breakdown</summary>

Example:
**Level 1: Jedi 1;** Str 10, Dex 17, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 14
**Talents** Battle Meditation
**Feats** Force Sensitive, Force Training, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Proficiency (lightsaber, simple)
**Skills** Acrobatics, Initiative, Perception, Use the Force
**Force Powers Known** Move Object, Saber Swarm [lightsaber form][/list:u:3mbsl1af]
**Level 2: Jedi 2;**
**Feats** Skill Focus (Use the Force)[/list:u:3mbsl1af]
**Level 3: Jedi 3;**
**Talents** Force Persuasion
**Feats** Force Training
**Force Powers Known** Surge, Force Stun[/list:u:3mbsl1af]
**Level 4: Jedi 4;** Str 10, Dex 18, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 14
**Feats** Melee Defense
**Force Powers Known** Negate Energy (2)[/list:u:3mbsl1af]

</details>

This technique may seem like a nuisance but is actually very efficient in making sure you don't miss out on class/level abilities when you level as well as allows the GM (me) a level by level looks of your progress. In the end actually saves time in error checking.

## Logs

### **Alicia** (2012-02-26 15:41:29)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Session 1 </span>
March 11, 2012
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Seemingly motionless among a sea of starships and satellites above the twinkling world of Brentaal, Sel Zonn Station grows larger in your view every second. A central pylon forms the bulk of the station’s mass, and three landing platforms leading to docking bays extend from the central section, equidistant from one another and jutting out into space. The dorsal side of the station features a discshaped secondary structure, on top of which blinking lights indicate the presence of a landing platform reserved for wealthy patrons.
The interior of the space station conforms to the Imperial standard. Walking about you take notice of the Imperial propaganda posters displayed prominently among the signage for the various shops located on the Promenade, the station’s main commercial area. Since Sel Zonn Station orbits a Core World, it is far better maintained than other structures of its age, and the main areas see constant renovations and repairs.
**Alicia:** For one reason or another you have found your way to Sel Zonn station, a nexus in the Core for travelers passing through to their next destination. The hanger bays are a hub of activity, but thankfully on this station, the customs officer is not interested on any of the persons coming through, however Nai does get a slight sneer as he passes.
**Alicia:** Making your way to the Promenade, you see it is filled with the bustle of revelry and commerce. Spilling out of the gambling halls are the sounds of victory and the moans of defeat, while the music of local bands issues from the cantinas. Only a handful of citizens mill about in the main areas of the Promenade, a few gazing out the massive windows at the planet Brentaal hovering below. Businesspeople hawk their wares to the passersby, and a few Imperial stormtroopers make their way down the main avenue of the Promenade on their usual patrol at a leisurely pace.
**Alicia:** (( take a moment to describe your characters and what you're currently doing... ))
** Ace checks his reflection after catching it in a nearby viewport, before scouring the promenade for the building he's after, offhandedly shuffling through his Sabaac deck **
** Kinara is a young near prepubescent woman in the simplest of clothing. A cloak upon her shoulders allowing her to keep much of herself protected from prying eyes. A toolbet on her waist held two toolkits as well as other items and a strange cylindrical device. She searches the promenade for a bulletin board or kiosk that will show a ship needing a mechanic or a crew needing a mechanic that will allow her a job and hopefully transport towards "home." **
**Alicia:** The casino isn't hard to find, the flashing neon lights are a start contrast mirrored by the Cantina further down the Promenade. The sounds of wheel tables and the usual sounds of a gambler's hall can be heard prevalently
**Charlie:** Nai finds himself stopped at the door of the port's casino staring blankly into the entrance. When he realizes himself he starts and remembers the provisions he's supposed to purchase
** Ace pockets his cards on his utility belt before pulling his cloak up over his head, masking his pale skin and brillaint green eyes behind the cowl, before making a beeline for The Credit Chip **
**Alicia:** Information consoles are readily availble throughout the Promenade.
**Alicia:** Nai finds there are a varied amount of stands scattared about the Promenade, but there's also a few specialty stores: Delga's Medical SUpplies and Mechanical Allies being the better maintained of the permanent stores.
**Charlie:** Nai see's he's lacking sufficient credits to purchase all the neccesary foodstuffs. So he decides to try his hand in a game of chane at the gambling hall.
** Ace stops a fair few yards before reaching the casino, ducking out of sigh momentarily to check the blaster concealed underneath his voluminous robes, before strolling up to the entrance and heading inside. **
**Alicia:** The Credit Chip is well maintained, and there's a varied amount of patrons milling about including a couple off duty imperial officers trying their luck. There's a sign promoting a Sabaac tournament.
** Kinara checks the consoles and smirks. SHe isn't used to having to think this outside of the box, that was usually up to Aqinos. But this time, she would have to be more than she thought she was. Games of chance might be useful, but at this time, she didn't need that much money. So instead, she headed to find a room, or preferably a cot, to stay in while she looked for work. **
** Kinara finds the lower rentals are in the lower reaches of the station and heads towards them to set up a place to stay. **
**Charlie:** Nai decides that the coincedence is too real for him ignore. He decides to question an employee about the tournament.
**Alicia:** The first employee Nai comes across is a Twi'lek waitress who is currently balancing a tray of drinks. She pauses long enough to give the Duros a smile and to point him toward the registration desk,
**Charlie:** Nai goes to the desk and asks of the details such as registration fees and the grand prize.
** Ace follows after the Duros as he presumably heads to register for the tournament **
**Alicia:** The registrar is a bored looking human who glances up only long enough at Nai to point at a sign.
"Welcome to the Credit Chip bi annual Sabaac Tournament.
500 credit buy in
10000 Grand prize"
** Kinara continued along, noting the disrepair and the unseemliness of the area. But it didn't matter, she pushed her trepidation aside, attempting to control her rising concerns. She would be the eye of the storm, removed from but part of the chaos around her. **
**Ace:** "Now that's what I'm talking about!" Ace says outloud. "Ten thousand creds!"
**Charlie:** Nai looks at Ace, "Do you have the 500 credit buy in?"
** Ace cocks his eyebrow **
**Ace:** "I wouldn't be hear if I didn't"
**Ace:** ((here*))
**Charlie:** "Fair enough. I suppose you fancy yourself a bit of a gambling man then.."
** Ace thinks to himself: 'Why is it always the aliens that are begging for cash, I presume that's what he's after, can't they just go and play low stakes games.' **
**Ace:** "There's no fancy about it. I AM a gambling man. This isn't a hobby, this is a profession for me. My next meal is in that tounament!"
**Ace:** "How about you? You thinking of entering?"
**Charlie:** "I was, until I saw the buy in. I'm a few hundred credits short unfortunately."
**Charlie:** "I guess I may have to do actual work for my food now."
** Ace mutters to himself: 'I knew it' **
**Ace:** "How about I cut you a deal? I always welcome competition"
**Charlie:** "What are you proposing?"
**Ace:** I cover the credits you need and if you win I keep, let's say 80% of the winnings?
**Charlie:** "...and if I don't win?"
**Ace:** "Well I'll have lost my money and you'll have lost whatever you put in."
** Ace shrugs **
**Ace:** "Up to you."
**Charlie:** "Sounds negotiable, I have 60 credits on me. So how about we go 12/78 on the winnings?"
**Ace:** "It just means I'll have put up a little bit more cash for my ten thousand creds"
**Ace:** "60?! Is that all? How do you even survive?"
**Charlie:** "I'm skilled at making luck."
**Ace:** 12/78? Where does the other 10 percent go?
** Ace lets out a chuckle **
**Ace:** "A man who believes he can forge his own luck, I like it"
**Ace:** "we'll go 12 / 88. The 88 being my share of the winnings of course"
**Charlie:** "My mistake. Did I say 12/72? I meant 22/78."
**Charlie:** "I've never been the best negotiator. I'll settle on 12/88. It's a deal."
** Ace shakes the Duros' hand saying: "Deal" **
** Ace wanders over to the registration desk **
**Ace:** "We're here to register for this tournament"
**Alicia:** The registrar looks up as Ace approaches. "Is that so?" he asks boredly, picking up his datapad. "Names and registration fee... please"
**Charlie:** "My name is Nai by the way. Nai Kaido."
**Ace:** "I'm Ace....just Ace in fact"
** Ace tosses two 500 credit creditchips onto the table **
**Charlie:** "That's seems pretty chic."
**Ace:** "I'm been using it for so long, I can't remember what my birth name is"
** Ace lets out a short laugh **
**Alicia:** With the credits provided the registrar enters the information onto his datapad. "The first match starts in 20 minutes. There will be two in which you will be competing against 4 other players." He puts the credits away and pulls out two badges appying a label with your names to them. "The tournament is to the back."
**Ace:** "Is there anywhere I can get a drink before we start? It's been a long shuttle ride?"
**Charlie:** "I saw a cantina on the way over I think."
**Alicia:** He motions obliquely to the rest of the Casino. "Just ask any of the girls."
**Ace:** "Even better"
** Ace sends a wink to the Duros **
**Charlie:** "Agreed."
**Charlie:** The duros briefly has a slight smirk on his face.
**Alicia:** Waitresses weave in and out of the various isles of slot machines and gaming tables
**Charlie:** "What do you drink?"
**Ace:** "Anything, as long as it has a bit of a burn too it and comes out of a bottle"
** Ace admires the waitresses as they move past **
**Charlie:** "Sounds good to me. Let's order from that Twi'lek if we see her again. She was cute"
**Alicia:** One of the waitresses approaches, spotting the badges. The young human while not scattily clad, wears tight fighting clothing showing off her many artfully placed curves. "What can I get you fellas?"
** Ace cant help but smile as the girl approaches **
**Charlie:** "I could go for a beer if you have any."
**Ace:** "What's the local speciality?"
**Alicia:** "Our batender makes a mean Rhuvian Fizz."
**Ace:** "Alright, sounds good! I'll take one of them"
**Charlie:** "On second thought I think I'll pass on a drink."
** Ace cocks his eyebrow again **
**Ace:** "Heh, need a sound mind for the tournament?"
**Charlie:** *Murmurs to Ace"
**Charlie:** "Just keeping face with this waitress, ya know?"
**Ace:** "Hah, you like a bit of human meat?" He whispers back to the Duros
**Alicia:** "Alright coming right up," she smiles prettily at them. "Would you like me to bring them over to the gaming tables?"
**Ace:** "If it's you then by all means"
** Ace shoots her a wink **
**Charlie:** The Duros has a grin for both the waitress and Ace, though for differnt reasons.
**Alicia:** She just gives Ace a larger smile as she saunters off to get the drinks
**Charlie:** "Why don't we head over to the tables?"
**Ace:** Sounds good, w can size up the opposition
**Charlie:** "Good idea"
** Ace heads towards the back of the casino, taking in the other games on offer **
**Charlie:** Nai follows Ace towards the tournament area.
**Alicia:** The area for the tournament has been roped off and while it consists of only a couple tables. Already milling about is your competition. Lt. Armen Arandis wears his Imperial uniform during the tournament, and each day it looks crisp, clean, and neatly pressed. He is young, perhaps not long out of the Imperial Academy, and his cool gaze is disrupted only by a long scar that cuts diagonally across his face, starting at one temple, crossing his right eye, and ending at his upper lip. Lt. Arandis is the picture of Imperial discipline, and he is also an excellent gambler.
**Alicia:** Then there's Lady Mirana Firor, a Happan woman who looks like as though she just stepped out of a royal court. The Lt and the Happan woman are conversing quietly apparently wasting time before the game.
A Devorian male stands across the section watching them
** Ace strolls over to the Devorian not wanting to disturb the others already in conversation. "Looking forward to the game?" He offers him casually **
**Charlie:** Nai takes a seat and relaxes for the moment.
**Alicia:** The final competitor is a Rodian male. He sports a bulky jacket made of Krayt Dragon leather (or so he claims).
**Alicia:** The Devorian gives Ace a side glance and then just answers with a "hmph"
**Alicia:** The waitress arrives with Ace
** Ace gives the Devorian a filthy look. Noting to himself: 'He's first to go down.' **
**Alicia:** Ace's and Nai's drinks, she approaches Ace with a smile offering him the red/orange liquid.
**Charlie:** After a brief respite, Nai decides to talk to the Rodian.
**Charlie:** "Ready for the game?"
**Ace:** "Excellent thank you. You can keep those coming." He says with another wink. "I'd like to see you some more. You might turn out to be my lucky charm!"
**Alicia:** The Rodian notices Nai's approach. "Ah fellow gambler..." he starts "I am Creeska, pleased to make your aquiantance." he says all in a rush/
** Ace takes a sip of his drink, smiling at the waitress **
**Alicia:** The waitress gives off a laugh. "I'm afraid I'm not working this section, but I'll see what I can do."
**Charlie:** "My name is Nai. It is good to meet you too. That is a very interesting vest you have. Where did you get it?"
**Ace:** "Awww shucks, well perhaps after I'm finished winning then?"
**Creeska:** "It is a long story my friend... Suffice to say I went through a great deal of trouble to aquire this particular treasure.. Made from the hide of a Krayt dragon. Fearsome creatures those."
**Alicia:** She gives another giggle, "You bet."
**Charlie:** "You killed a Krayt dragon?"
**Creeska:** "Maker, no... But it's not many who will take one down."
**Charlie:** "I think I understand."
**Alicia:** A man enters the area, he glances around looking at the name tags of the entrants. "May have your attention," the older man says. "I'm Cecel Vane, the proprietor of this establishment. I'd like to welcome you to our humble tournament. If you would take your seats we will begin."
**Charlie:** "Time to begin."
** Ace dismisses the girl telling her he'd see her later, before moving over to take a seat **
**Charlie:** Nai walks with Creeska to the seats and sits between the Rodian and Ace
**Alicia:** The other four entrants move to take their choice seat as well, the Officercasting sneers at the aliens present. The Happan woman seems indifferent to their presence
** Ace rolls his eyes at the Officer, his jingoism wasn't appreciated **
**Ace:** "Let's keep this friendly guys..."
**Ace:** "We're all here for the creds remember, not brig time."
**Ace:** "...or hospital time for that matter"
** Ace adds glancing at the lieutenant **

**Alicia:** With business concluded the new Tournament champ and his benefactor head out onto the promenade. A woman with short black hair and the greasy blue uniform of a mechanic like that worn by the mechanics and repair crews of the station comes stumbling onto the Promenade, clutching her midsection as though injured. She struggles to make her way across the floor in Ace’s direction, though clearly she is having difficulty walking.
“Please, help me,” she calls out. “There are credits in it for you, just help me!”
Mere seconds later, two stormtroopers burst into the area from the south end of the Promenade. They raise their blasters, aiming them at the woman, and shout through their helmet speakers, “Step
away from that woman. She is under arrest in the name of the Emperor!”
Kinara catches this as she makes her way to speak to the two strange looking men.
**Ace:** "I'm sorry ma'am, but we've got more than enough credits between us for now. Perhaps we could do this one on the house though?"

****Maya:**** "To what end.. There were at least a dozen witnesses.. Best to scadaddle and not get caught red-handed
**Maya:** ."
**Ace:** "yeah probably not the best idea"
**Ace:** ((regrettd saying that instantly lol when i remembered we were in the middle of a promenade :P
** Kinara walks only as Maya walks, subordinating herself to Maya's guidance. **
** Maya starts making her way down the passage with Kin's help. **
**Maya:**
The interior of the space station conforms to the Imperial standard. Since Sel Zonn Station orbits a Core World, it is far better maintained than other structures of its age, and the main areas see constant enovations and repairs. However, a few steps off of the beaten path quickly reveal that the station is rotting from the inside out. A short walk away from the main venues leads to decrepit sections of the station, filled with broken lights, tarnished metal walls, missing deck plates, and all manner of suspicious aliens that have been driven out of the nicer sections by the Empire.
**Ace:** "Oh wow..."
** Ace takes in the new surroundings, holding his blaster close **
** Maya leads the ragtag group into the lower sections of the station, where humans become fewer and aliens more prevalent. The only humans seem to be those that have needed a reason to escape into ambiguity. Leaning against a wall she inserts a card into a still working door panel, waiting for it to slide open before walking in. **
**Maya:**
The room is small, but seems to have been maintained recently to function as a bolt hole of sorts. A large box of rations rests to the side of a cot where Maya makes her way.
**Charlie:** "So, what was that all about?"
** Ace looks over his shoulder before following her in checking if they were followed **
**Maya:** "Might be best to stay here for a bit, till things calm down. Unfortunately... There isn't time." She looks at Ace and then at the others as if decided whether she wants to trust them fully.
** Ace cocks his eyebrow **
**Kinara:** Sadly, Kinara's only ability in treating injuries is her understanding of the Force. So instead, she sat, listening and waiting for Maya to say she needed something.
**Maya:** "I'm a member of Alderaanian Security. I was sent here to pick up cargo that my boss wants.. It seems though that the Empire caught word of my arrival and I got flagged me as a troublemaker."
**Ace:** ((Lore check for Alderaanian Security?))
**Maya:** go ahead
**Ace:** Lore [1d20+6] => [12,6] = (18)
**Ace:** "Well you certainly made an impression"
**Charlie:** "What would you be bringing from this station back to Alderaan?"
**Maya:** "Very valuable cargo.. I was comissioned by Senator Organa himself to bring it to Alderaan, but that's going to be nearly impossible for me now." She says, leaning back against the wall obviously exhausted. She seems to think a moment.
**Charlie:** "Well I arrived here in a ship only hours ago. I'm not sure if the other two crew members are even here after our little party on the promenade."
**Ace:** "This valuable cargo wouldn't have been stolen from our Imperial breathren on the station would it?"
**Maya:** "Would you be willing to finish this for me? Senator Organa I'm sure would be more than willing to reward you considering the lives in stake if he doesn't get it. I have a transport waiting for further orders that can get us out of here."
**Maya:** "No, it was shipped here from the Deep Core. Sent here specifically because customs is lax."
** Kinara considers it a moment and closes her eyes. She lets the Force move through her and decides that obviously, the Force wanted her involved in this, so she simply nods. "Of course, I'll help." **
**Charlie:** "Okay I'm already in trouble, why not go on a trip too?"
**Ace:** "As long as Alderaan has credits and casino's I'm game!"
** Maya looks at Kinara and nods, looking at they agree she continues. "I was to meet Switch in Deep Storage Bay V14. He's the one handling the trasaction, recieving and store the cargo. He's the only one who knows where it is at the moment." **
**Ace:** "and he'll trust us?"
**Maya:** "He's nothing if not an entrepanuar."
**Charlie:** "I see."
**Maya:** "He doesn't work for Alderaanian Security directly so has no loyalties to anyone but the highest bidder."
**Charlie:** "Typical"
**Ace:** "Lets hope no one's out bid us then"
**Charlie:** "Well we did just get pretty lucky a few times."
** Maya pulls from her pocket a datachip. "This has the directions to the bay. I' also should give you my comm frequency so you can call me when you have the cargo." **
**Ace:** "Yeah, two out of three aint bad2
**Ace:** "I take it payment's been taken care of already?"
**Maya:** "As far as I'm aware."
**Ace:** "Excellent. How long do we have, before the Imperials come looking do you think?"
**Charlie:** "I kind of hungry. Do you have any food?"
** Maya motions to the small crate of rations, before answering Ace's question. "Might just want to try and stay away from the main areas for a bit. The planetary security may dely them due to jurisdiction bullshit, but who knows how long that will last." **
**Charlie:** Nai helps himself to the rations as the other two speak.
** Ace wanders over to the crate, picking out a few ratio packs **
**Ace:** "Yeah, I suppose our faces are going to be plastered all over the promenade holo screens
**Maya:** "Just lay low and I think you'll be fine.. As for me. I'm going to stay here and keep out of sight till you contact me."
**Ace:** "Do you need any more medical attention?"
**Ace:** "Or will you be fine?"
**Maya:** With that she starts making herself comfortable on the cot, wincing as she pulls at one wound or another. "Nothing a night in a bacta tank won't fix, but that won't be happening till we get away from here.. so maybe hurry it up a bit?"
** Kinara finally stands and heads for the door. She looks back to the other two with Maya. "Let's go." **
**Ace:** "Alright, we're off. Thanks for the supplies"
**Charlie:** "No problem, we got just as much reason to get out of here as you do."
** Maya gives a half hearted wave as you leave. "Lock the door on your way out," she calls. **
****Maya:****
With that you leave the injured woman you had saved from an unknown fate. Now you're working to finish what she started and help put into work a plan to help a great many others.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Session 2</span>
April 1, 2012
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

It's an eventful meeting on the Promenade where our heroes rescued the near dead Maya from the clutches of a team of Stormtroopers. Taking them deep into Sel Zonn station, she reveals she is a member of Alderaanian Security sent on special assignment by Senator Bail Organa himself. Her mission was to locate and retrieve cargo from Switch who can be found in Deep Storage bay V14, but being marked as a dissident upon arrival her mission took a bad turn. Having agreed to help, the heroes now face the issue of locating and making their way to the Deep Storage Bay and convincing Switch to hand over this important cargo.
Having just left the safe room Maya is now holed up in till she’s contacted, the heroes now have to decide their next move.
** Kinara waits for the other person to come along. Trusting in the Force to tell her he can be trusted. **
**Charlie:** Nai decides to find an Info terminal to see how to get to the deep storage bay.
**Alicia:** There's terminals scattered through out, though the only infomation you can gather is that the bay V14 is on a level that is off limits to non-Imperial personnel.
**Alicia:** When I say only I mean it's apparently common knowledge.
**Charlie:** "Kinara, what do you think we should do?"
**Alicia:** you can make a Use COmputer check to delve into records and the like
**Charlie:** I would like to make a use computer check to see if we can't get more info.
**Charlie:** Use Computer: [1d20+3+5] => [7,3,5] = (15)
**Kinara:** "We should be careful. Obviously. But make sure the terminal likes you."
**Alicia:** (( get the whisper Charlie? ))
**Charlie:** ((Yeah just saw it.))
**Charlie:** "Kinara, the computer shows me that the storage bay is in a section of the station that has been quarintined for over a year and a half. However it also showed me that the shared exhaust sytems connect the entire station.
**Charlie:** "
**Kinara:** Closing her eyes a bit, "And the systems into the quarantined zone are open still to the rest of the station?"
**Charlie:** "The system that runs over the top of our storage bay is one of the primary ones so it should still be accessable.
**Kinara:** "Then if we're quiet enough, we should be able to get there without interruption." She nodded as she looked for an entrance.
**Charlie:** "Alright. Let's go find an entrance thats not in plain sight."
It takes a bit of maneuvering through access ladders and constant checking of your location but you finally arrive in the vicinity of deep storage bay V14. You find that you have entered a very neglected part of the station. Many of the lights have burned out, and blaster marks and carbon scoring mar the walls, ceiling, and floor. The area reeks of ozone and electrical fires, and pools of coolant litter the hallways at regular intervals. After winding yourr way through a near-labyrinth of decrepit corridors, you come upon bay V14, which is guarded by a pair of Gamorreans wielding vibro-axes.
**Alicia:** The converse quietly between them in thir grunting language, at present taking no notice in you.
** Kinara looks to her companion and gestures for him to head towards teh Gamorreans. **
**Charlie:** Nai walks up to the pair of Gamorreans, clearing his thoat, attempts to hail the attention of the two.
**Alicia:** Their conversation ends as Nai draws closer, they take no hostile action seeming more concerned with blocking the door.
**Charlie:** "We are here to see Switch."
**Alicia:** They just stare at Nai.
**Charlie:** "I take it you don't speak Gamorrean either, do you Kinara?"
** Kinara walks closer, head lowered like a slave. "No, Master. I am sorry." **
**Alicia:** (( hehe that's actually kinda funny.. a human slaved to a Duros.. sort of switched to what will probably start becoming a regular occurance. Especially so close to the Core.. anyways. I've digressed ))
**Charlie:** Nai attempts to walk past the two and make contact with the door
Charlie (exit): 13:05
**Alicia:** Nai's attempt to reach the door is blocked by the Gamorreans, one stepping in closer to fully block his way. The other gives a grunt in warning.
**Charlie:** "I don't think we'll be able to talk our way in here Kinara. Do you have any ideas?"
** Kinara chews on her lower lip and sighs. "Well, I could get through them, but that would still leave you on the wrong side of the door." She then allows the Force to tell her what would be best with her and her companion's abilities.**
**Kinara:** Stepping forward, she lowers her head. "Master, perhaps I am not worth what is beyond the door. I could be a trade for your entrance."
**Charlie:** "Nonsense, though if I did pretend I intended to trade you as a slave they might let us in. Let's try that."
**Alicia:** (( bio brb ))
** Kinara rolls her eyes and looks up at the Duros. "There goes that idea." **
**Charlie:** ((oops forgot our proximity))
**Alicia:** (( back ))
**Alicia:** With the two not attempting entry once more, the two go back to their conversation apparently ignoring them again
** Kinara gently pushes the Duro back and clears her throat. In a gruff, commanding voice. "You have FAILED! What do you think you're doing? The two of us just tried to get in and all you did was grunt? How dare you? YOu should have tried to kill us. Don't you know what you're guarding?" **
**Kinara:** "General Nai, take these men in for...reeducation."
**Alicia:** They stop for a moment to listen to the young woman's words, but they seem to have little effect. Instead the one starts to make a grunting sound which sounds like laughter and says something to his companion. The other grunts-laughs in return.
**Alicia:** They seem to decide something between themselves and still laughing move out of the way to the door, allowing you access.
**Kinara:** Shrugging, she stepped back to let Nai go first.
**Charlie:** Nai heads on through in to the bay
The deep storage bay is as run-down as the hallways leading up to it, with entire metal plates missing from the floor and a huge, open exhaust shaft near the back of the room. Large crates litter the area, creating the appearance of a haphazard mess, and the air has a distinct smell of sweat and fumes that makes the entire area unpleasant. Flickering lights provide modest illumination, and a burst pipe along the ceiling leaks blue fluid down one wall. Near the center of the room is an item that seems very out of place—a large, finely crafted desk made of Japor ivory wood, which means that the desk is both priceless and rare. Sitting peacefully behind the desk is a protocol droid with shiny, ebony coverings that seem to soak up light and offer only the slightest reflection. The droid’s eyes flicker slightly, as though imitating a person blinking rapidly.
**Alicia:** The protocol droid speaks up with Coruscanti-Imperial accent and an obviously male persona. “Greetings. I welcome you to my little piece of the galaxy,” he says cheerfully and lightly, as though his power and prestige leaves him without a care in the world. “I am Switch and this is my assistant R5-B8.” With a sweep of his ebony arm he indicates an R5 series droid beeping and burbling quietly at his side hidden behind the desk, apparently lost in its own world.
**Kinara:** Stepping forward, Kinara bows to him. "Greetings, Switch. I am Kinara and this is my associate, Nai. We were sent by Maya."
**Switch:** "Would you care for any refreshments?" He indicates a well stocked wet bar off to the side.
**Kinara:** She shook her head only slightly.
**Charlie:** Laughing at the droid "I'll have whatever you're having."
**Switch:** "Ah yes, I heard what happened to her. Such bad luck."
Sorry I don't know what /roll is!
**Switch:** (( roll persuasion to shift his attitutde ))
**Switch:** "I doubt entirely you'd be able to consume it, but my majordomo assures me the selection is execptional." As if being summoned the Twi'lek stands out from the shadows and moves to pour a drink.
**Kinara:** ((me or charlie?))
**Switch:** for Charlie
**Charlie:** Persuasion: [1d20+0] => [3,0] = (3)
**Switch:** oh.. both of you can roll. the drink is for Charlie ;)
**Kinara:** [1d20+1] => [3,1] = (4)
**Kinara:** ((we are NOT meant to get this guy to like us))
**Charlie:** ((not one bit))
**Switch:** There's other ways, you jsut have to figure them out
**Switch:** With the drink poured the Twi'lek hands over a crystal glass of a dark amber liquid
**Charlie:** "Will this kill me if i drink it?"
**Switch:** "It would hardly be productive." His eyes glint in a mischevious fashion.
** Kinara forces herself not to react to Nai's question. She slowly steps forward, very casually. "I am sorry for the intrusion. But Maya was quite insistent that we at least try to contact you and convincing you to let us have the cargo."**
**Kinara:** ((oh my god...this is the classic bait and switch...or in this case, b8 and switch))
**Switch:** "Yes, yes... Though I'm afraid there the matter of payment. She inconveniently aroused the Imperial interest here. Keeping the cargo from their snooping has become quite costly."
**Kinara:** "How costly?"
**Switch:** "A thousand credits should cover it."
**Charlie:** "Are you sure we can't lower that number?"
** Switch taps the metal casing of his fingers on the desk. "Well.." he says drawing it out. "I could perhaps reduce the fee with something I value more; information." **
**Kinara:** "Such as?"
**Switch:** "Anything of note you may come across."
**Charlie:** "What in your opinions is worth noting?"
**Switch:** "Anything can lead to everything."
**Switch:** "Even the most simplest of rumors."
**Kinara:** "Hmmm. Since this is your domain, you obviously know about the money being diverted."
**Switch:** "It wouldn't do to have Imperials getting into my business now would it?"
**Kinara:** "That depends on whether or not they'll insist upon it."
**Switch:** "They like the bit of change in their pockets."
**Kinara:** "Oh, I wasn't talking about that money."
**Switch:** "Now then, do we have a deal?"
**Kinara:** "The cargo for information?"
**Switch:** "Oh, the infomartion provides a discount. Say 400 off."
**Charlie:** "Sounds good to me."
**Kinara:** "Very well." She bows and backs off a bit as though in the presence of royalty. Why? Well, because she effectively is.
**Charlie:** "I have 600 credits for you Switch."
**Switch:** Once the payment has been handed over, he steeples his ebony plated fingers in front of him. "NOw then, you can find the cargo in the main docking bay on Blue Deck. I'd be wary, though, it's heavily traveled by Imperial loyalists and one of the few places the Imperial ships dock.
**Kinara:** "Thank you, Switch."
**Charlie:** "Shall we be on our way then?"
** Switch eyes blink once more. "It was a pleasure of course." However, his words are interrupted. **
**Switch:** Blaster fire sounds from outside in the hall, and suddenly the blast doors leading into the storage bay slide open to reveal a number of armed thugs outside. In the midst of the rabble is a large Chevin, his trunk hanging low to the ground and his mouth twisted in a snarl. This massive Chevin looks old, even for his species. Scars cross his face, giving him a weathered look that matches his leathery skin. His clothes are little more than rags, and a large blaster pistol pokes out from beneath his vest as though ready to be drawn on a moment’s notice.
“So you thought you could hide your deal with the off worlders from me, droid? I’m tired of not getting my cut! Turn him into a scrap heap, boys!”
The thugs with the Chevin need no further prompting and immediately open fire!
