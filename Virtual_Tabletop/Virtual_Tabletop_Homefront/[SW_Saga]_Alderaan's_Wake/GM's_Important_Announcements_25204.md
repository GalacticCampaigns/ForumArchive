# GM's Important Announcements

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-03-19 13:05:37)

This is only for urgent messages that shouldn't be bogged down in the OOC thread.
My message this week is to make sure you all get your character sheets updated and current. Zvi you received 1000 XP from the last session. And I'll need everyone's character sheets current by Thursday. Your levels, skills, and promotion score will go a long way in determining your new ship and ranks. So if you are interested in getting the most for your characters then your sheets should be fully updated by Thursday.
Also, some players were upset that they did not get to have backstories and that altered the way they made their character sheets. So, since the academy is now incomplete you may respec your characters. (Using 32 point buy and leveling yourself up to the current level, minusing any Destiny points you have spent). If you feel your character would have spent a certain amount of time in training learning a specific skill then now is the time to redesign your character.
Either way, all sheets must be completed by Thursday for final rank evaluation.

Ok, after this week I will be resuming sidequests and be doing updates throughout the game.
I will update the dossiers and also be adding a new thread, as well as updating the standard issue thread with vehicle stats and crew stats.
Also, I will be adding two new threads for game/story purposes. The first thread will be a PBP thread to communicate with Moff Alexander Kane. The second thread will be a fairly comprehensive stat block on crew skill, performance, morale, incidents, and respect. Respect will be a special addition to the leadership dynamic that will represent how the crew views you as a leader. If the crew favors you, you will receive certain bonuses. They may only respect you, favor you, or be intimidated by you. For each different type of respect, it will grant you a different type of bonus. In the negative aspect of this stat addition, the crew may not respect you at all....
This stat block of the crew's performance will encourage leadership and persuasion checks to bolster the crew's morale, albeit through fear or positive motivation.

Alright everyone...not sure how many people are going to actually look at this as board activity is low. I did say I would post here for an update on play times. Well I don't think we are going to play until I return. For one, I did not have enough room for my rulebooks in my luggage so I guess I need the PDF's? And it also seems that playing at night my disturb my host family and I don't want to do that. If we played at 4 CST that would be 6 AM JPN time.
I like to get my workouts in at 6 because it quickly becomes very hot in this part of Japan and that is not favorable. I also want to be in better shape for the beach lol. With all this being said I propose we move to temporary PBP. OR, we can just suspend the game until I get back. The game has reached a proverbial boiling point in terms of the story...like everything is about to explode. I think if we went to PBP now we'd kill some of the suspense. HOWEVER, I will leave that at the discretion of the players. Maybe we could retroactivate some sidequests? Like the search for rare HK droid parts? Let me know what you guys think.
