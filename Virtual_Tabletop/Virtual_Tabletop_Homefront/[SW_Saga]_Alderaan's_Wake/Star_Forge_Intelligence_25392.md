<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">INTELLIGENCE REPORT (FORM-207)</span>
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET
TO: Emperor Maleficere and his Sith Council
FROM: Section Researcher J506 - Navy Chief Cleff Ardant
SUBJECT: STAR FORGE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS</span>
The information below was recovered from the Star Forge. It's location is difficult to pinpoint as it is somewhere in the Unknown Regions. This report was prepared by Chief Cleff Ardant. The following information beyond this point were found in the form of data packets in Sith language textual form or Holovid footage. The entries are from differing individuals, some listed, and some are not. The data packet entrants have been referenced as names from ancient times and up. The following information listed is incoherent and jumbled, but my final notes reveal most of my conclusions. It will be difficult to understand, but please forward any questions about the data packets to me. I would HIGHLY advise you to ask at least one question about each data packet. Here is the relevant intelligence...
**Data Packet 1 - Entrant name as Darth Revan**
A lot of this mystery is revealed by the Star Forge. It was indeed the Celestials that taught the Rakatan this lesson. Thus, a Force Trance is an amplified version of sleeping. This is why you rejuvenate faster in a Force Trance than sleep; you are more attuned conduit of the Force in this state. And in the subconscious state you are more susceptible to understand the mysteries of the Force. This would explain why Arkas was having the dreams that he did.
Chief Ardant notes* (It is known that the Forge responded to Malificere and Daiyu at one time…but no one else. This has been the toughest setback in the research phase, as it rarely responded in any manner to anyone else.)
<strong>Data Packet 2 - Darth Strife </strong>
- The Force was there to provide a sense of peace, harmony, balance, and understanding for any impurities. Without light, there would be no darkness, and vice versa. The Force, understood at its apex, offered complete inner peace and balance no matter the situation. However, The Force was seemingly tainted when people such as the Rakatan twisted it with the Dark Side of the Force. This was not entirely out of the Force’s understanding. But over time the Force was less and less understood throughout time. The Force would always be present, but people would lose the understanding of this mystical energy. (AT the input of the word Darth or Death the Star Forge seems to have a certain knowledge of life essence. It recognizes energy patterns that are produced by life forms, possibly bio-electrical fields. This is unconfirmed as it hasn’t recognized anyone of the science crew. Its sensor units detect life energy anywhere within the direct proximity of the Forge. I have also discovered the Star Forge can only be powered by trained Force sensitives. The Rakatans constructed it this station to be powered by the Force itself. Force Sensitives must be intravenously attached to Star Forge appendages to create power. I am unsure of other means to power this station, but I am sure there is other one. If anything were to happen to the Force sensitives powering the station I am unsure what would become of it. It may have an emergency power alternative.
In the end, the Force would be restored to balance due to the actions of Rakatans and the people who would act against it. Awne Tora and Anakin Skywalker are the Chosen who bring balance. Along with the Vong Reaver and Arkas Wylt. The actions these people commit will determine the future of the galaxy, whether they know it or not. Ultimately, the Force is directly influenced by the people who interact with it. This gives it danger and usefulness at the same time.
<strong>Data Packet 3 - Entrant Darth Strife</strong>
Apparently, when Gor ‘Ak had sent the Vjun intelligence to the Verpine supercomputer, it had made its way into other people’s hands. Inscribed on the intel was the evidence of the Reavers and InterTech’s backing of the clone warriors. The Verpine were very much interested in the Star Forge. They were aware of the Star Forge’s existence when Darth Strife was around. The top tier executives in Falsoor brought the knowledge of the Verpine discovering the Shadow Project to Strife. The Verpine and Strife had to negotiate some sort of deal for the Verpine to keep quiet. Fortunately, the deal had worked better than Strife had predicted. The Verpine would study the Star Forge that created the Reaver ship; this was all due to the Holocron in Strife’s possession. However, after Strife’s death, top Verpine scientists were still studying the nature of this mysterious Star Forge. The Verpine were interested in the Star Forge solely for its technological value. 
**Data Packet 4 - Entrant Unknown**
The Celestials are an enigmatic race who by very few are theorized to have created the galaxy. From them, they are also thought to have created Zonama Sekot. Zonama Sekot, the living planet, was one powerful embodiment of the Force. It was a conduit of the Force’s will in the large spectrum of the galaxy. Though the origins of the Force are largely unknown, there are certain manifestations in the galaxy that helped creatures understand the Force’s meaning. The Celestials contacted the Rakatan at some point in time. This species held great knowledge, and they at one time, represented the pinnacle of evolution.
The Celestials saw potential in the Rakatan and attempted to train them up on what they knew. Their teachings were so great; the Rakatans barely understood what they meant. The Celestials knew how to use the Force, but were unable to instruct the Rakatans on its use. And the Celestials held such power in the Force that it was inconceivable, and it is believed they were the ones who had a part in creating the galaxy with their power of the Force. Their lifestyle was so advanced, that the Rakatans almost had no hope of understanding them. But the Celestials did something drastic and wholly noble. They took their essence and formed the Kissaen holocron from Zonama Sekot. The Celestials were a pure race, and knew no pain or suffering due to their purity through the Force. They had a blissful existence, and were willing to share it with the Rakatans. However, once the gift of the Kissaen Holocron was in their hands, the Celestials began losing their powers strangely. The Rakatans enslaved the Celestials as knowledge of the Force spread throughout the galaxy. The Force’s use was now in the hands of most living creatures, but it was now impure in its use. The actions of a less pure race had tainted the Force. Imperfection saturated the galaxy through the energy of the Force. Thus, the Force would be out of balance for eons to come.
Chief Ardant's final notes - Though the data packets are disorganized and difficult to come to any real conclusions with, my theory is that the Rakatan and Celestials worked together to learn the Force. At the time when the Rakatan reached the pinnacle of their Force understanding, they enslaved the Celestials. The Celestials were extinct or a species of mythology. The Rakatan would take their allegedly superior knowledge of the Force and create a space station that is somehow connected to the Force. The mystery is remarkable, but I will understand the Force and technology combined. That is what the Star Forge appears to be and what fascinates me. It is the amalgamation of the galaxy's two greatest achievements, the Force and technology. I must know the station's secrets.
