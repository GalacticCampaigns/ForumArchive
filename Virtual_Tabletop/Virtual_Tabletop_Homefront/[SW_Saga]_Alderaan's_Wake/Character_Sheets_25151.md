# Character Sheets

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-01-16 23:39:20)

Place your character sheets here. A reminder to help you out... Starting equipment is only allowed to have some simple clothing and simple weapons. You may take max credits and max Hit Points for every level. We are utilizing 32 point buy for attributes. Veterans (anyone who has played a previous campaign of mine), are allowed to level up to 9 or 8. It is their choice. You must take at least one level of Officer prestige. The Legacies I listed are a requirement, and The discovery destiny is optional. (Any other destinies must be approved by me). You cannot take Force Sensitivity (even if you have a force sensitive legacy), or any levels in the Jedi classes. Do not worry about back stories or age. Also, do not give yourself the last name of your legacy lineage. Those will be covered in the story line.
I look forward to everyone's submissions!

Description:
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Nina stands tall at 5'9” at the age of 28, short purple hair that's often wild. She wears a black and purple cloth covering over her eyes out of respect for others, the cloth a gift from her mentor on his death bed in his colors as a sign to show other Sith that she had been trained by him. Her standard clothes are loose in browns or blacks, that make it easy to fight in, though she has a few items of other brighter colors that she wears when needing to appear before more noble people.]

Bio:<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Sight is a concept that all life in the galaxy relies on. Take it away and life finds a means to adapt if it's evolutionary. Nina was born of those with the evolutionary advantage.
Yanibar is not one of those planets that kind to life, but when one is born from those that descended from those that were born on the planet..one gains the advantage of knowledge and instinct. The Zeison Sha had been on the planet for generations, ever since the Murderous Order had left them to rot there. The joke was on them, the tribe learned, and grew, and now they were ferocious and managed to build a settlement that became a hub for trade.
That was where Nina was born, her parents third generation Miraluka born to the planet bust she was still one of barely a handful of her race. It didn't matter to her, she grew up seeing the tribe as her family as a whole. And when she showed her promise of the force as a baby, like all full blooded Miraluka, she trained with her parents, with friends; in the temple and out in the wild to hone her skills.
Children will always be children though, and she had been teased when she was still young, believed to have a disadvantage by trader kids that passed by because of the cloth that covered her eyes. A gift from her mother, passed down through the generations.
And then IT happened. Her parents had been part of a exploration team to see what other planets were near to trade goods with; they didn't come back. The two survivors had talked about how there had been a battle far off, different ships, and so much force energy, the ships that felt like them like Jedi had shot at them. They must have confused the sense of force, stupid Jedi, of all the escape pods that survived it was only the two that had returned out of 16 people.
The tribe mourned the loss of brothers and sisters, of her parents, and Nina decided that there was nothing left for her on her home. She'd leave and head away, and see if maybe she could avenge them in time. So she left. Traveled far and wide, learned new tricks until another user of the force found her. He had seemed fascinated by her, that she could sense him so easily. He had ask how, she said he was an idiot. “Of course I can see you blind bantha. It's you that doesn't understand what seeing is.”
To Nina, everyone but those of her kind are blind, they only see what their eyes and brain says is there, missing everything. Nina can see life itself, see the force in everything, see emotion, see truth. She can see it's everyone else who can't. He had been fascinated all the more, when she had asked, hand on her discblade if he was of the Order; he had laughed out right and asked why she couldn't tell. She had asked, was there a difference of orders and he had offered to teach her.
There was a differences. And it was so much like her own teaching it all came easy to her. In her time with him learning she learned of other things. Droids for example, mostly hated by what she learned was the Empire and his kind, Sith, but she found them fascinating. A life form that had no life. Her first encounter had freaked her out, she'd walked into a droid, then tripped over another; she locked herself in her mentors room terrified until he brought one in and let her touch it. Amazing...a life she could hear speak...but a void in her sight. A dark spot beside her mentor, nothing there, it was fascinating.
As she grew, she learned more, taking in more from her mentor and becoming educated, wise, lethal in words as much as action...and more lethal with the force. She never formally called him Master, not like others she'd seen, he wasn't a Master to her, he was....a mentor, a father type that helped with the void of loosing her own. And it seemed this difference in thought brought her respect of all forms from all walks of life.
When he passed into the force, she was devastated, but left for Couracant as he had intended to take them to finally have her meet the Emperor. Wearing the black cloth he gifted her on his death bed as a sign of her progress to the Sith, and a tie back to him. Because she was ready.
