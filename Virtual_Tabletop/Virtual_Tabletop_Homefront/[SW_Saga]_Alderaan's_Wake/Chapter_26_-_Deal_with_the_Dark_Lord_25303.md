# Chapter 26 - Deal with the Dark Lord

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-26 20:24:51)

*((A thought quickly came to Daiyu's head. Since she had Fel's comlink frequency it could be used directly to follow them.))*
The Dark Lord began to pace about, clenching his right hand as he moved about. **"You needn't worry yourself about the members of your crew. I want Roan Fel and the two Sith. Most importantly FEL. He MUST be mine! Tell me where I can find them."**
He stopped pacing for a moment and looked at the Commodore. He was awaiting the location of them quite patiently for a Sith.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Undercity Sewers**
Roan Fel adjusted his ragged garments and gave a cursory glance at his lightsaber before hiding it. He trudged down the blackened sludge and looked down a tunnel way that was a right turn from there location. He looked back to the Sith. The Vindicator crew members began running down the sewer back to the upper levels of the city.
**"Are you coming? OR Did you all really set a trap for me?!"**

Daiyu gulped faintly, still nervous on how exactly he might be planning to kill her; she hadn't ever angered him to this point she wasn't sure what to expect from him now. Still she looked to the comlink in her hand and set to work on backing the signal to find Fel's location.

Commodore Daiyu saw a slight blue dot illuminate on the side of her comlink indicating that she had a fix on Roan Fel's comlink. It would turn green once her comlink was within 100 meters of him. Darth Krayt loomed over Daiyu and saw that she had a zero on his location. He took the comlink from her hand with his black armored gauntlet, but it was gentle.
He went to his throne and pushed a button on the control console. **"Lord Nihl, are all stations on alert? Has the Defense fleet blockaded the entire orbit?…… It will take an estimated 8 minutes for the fleet to be in position? Deploy the *A'Sharaad* as well. Confirmed. I want no ships to enter or exit Coruscant. Send in a squad of Darktroopers to my Throne Room."**

Momentarily, a squad of black armored Stormtroopers with short crimson capes entered. They were equipped with short barreled rifles that looked similar to E-11's, and were loaded with fairly large blaster packs on the side.
**"Datapad…"**
The squad leader holstered his unique weapon on his hip holster and presented a datapad. He also rendered a salute before Krayt dismissed him. He attached the comlink to the datapad via a cable connection. He studied a crude readout of the Jedi Temple map and saw a singular blip deep below their current position. Darth Krayt took a moment to stretch out with the Force.
**"That's Roan Fel. He's in the Undercity sewers, sub level B1, roughly 120 meters on heading 131.6 from the primary turbolift."**
Darth Krayt turned to Commodore Daiyu. He used the Force to guide the comlink to her hand. He also ordered the squad to move into an overwatch position just above the sewers to track their movements. **"I'd rather not get myself dirty searching for that womp rat that he is in the sewers. So, call to Roan Fel and tell him to come to me. Or I will go to him. There is no escape for him. Tell him to bring the other two with him."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Undercity Sewers Sublevel B1**</span>
Malificere leaned back against the wall of the dirty sewers. If there was good point about this location, it was full of disgusting creatures. That would help him focus on the Force with life energy surrounding him. He relaxed and then focused his fear, anger, and aggression. He used the Force like a great storm whipping over Kamino to scathe for answers.
*There were…hostile forces all around. Closing in. He felt their determination and fear. Were their other Sith coming? No…but he could feel their presence on this planet as well. He stretched beyond the filth of the sewers with the power of the Force and concentrated. He felt an overwhelming enemy. Malificere had a nagging sense that was burning his very soul that they were in danger just sitting here. If they ran, most likely they would be intercepted. They could also attempt to blend in with the locals…but likely that would delay the inevitable as he KNEW Krayt could sense him. They had already met, so their presences were interlocked in the great web of the Force. He searched for answers, but they were difficult to predict. Perhaps surrender? At least then he may face the Dark Lord and channel his rage at his captors. After all just getting to bare down on his enemies with all of his hatred would be satisfying enough for any fate. But, the fear was sinking in that his destiny to fulfill Palpatine's legacy was in great danger. **NO!** He needed the Dark Side more than anything. Perhaps he could use his speechcraft as an alternative. Sith could be cunning when the time was right. He could stoop to any level to achieve his victory.*
Malificere continued to breathe heavily as the Dark Side coursed through his veins. There was likely no way out. Perhaps the fear of imminent failure of Palpatine's Legacy bothered him. However, Malificere was trained to use this fear. But he could at least use his absolute BRUTAL rage to create a path. He remembered the final passage of the Sith Code. *Through Power; my chains are broken.*
He opened his eyes to see Invictus stalking in the shadows, staying ever vigilant around the Emperor who had his eyes intently focused on Malificere. The Emperor now knew his presence in the Dark Side.

Maleficere looked to Fel finally and then to Invictus, then back again.
> **My Lord, it is time I believe that we left these sewers, as you had said. Are you aware of any secret ways to our landing pad? I can feel our enemies closing in around us&#8230;A thought comes to me though.**

He stared at Fel, the one word he swore to himself he would never do now seemed like their only viable option. **> We could surrender&#8230;at least then that would bring us closer than we are now to cutting him down. I fear that if they know our location, then Daiyu has failed in her role. If you have any better option, then please say it now.** He looked to Invictus, and gave a nod. **> You as well&#8230;friend. I trust your judgement even more than my own&#8230;But if we are to move, then we do so now.**

### **zerah** (2013-01-27 10:20:51)

Daiyu let him take the link from her hand, marveling that he was still being gentle with her, and again when he returned the com to her hands by way of the force. She watched the proceedings in the throne room with a mix of anxiety, trepidation, amazement, respect, but mostly she was anxious. She kept waiting for the order to kill her, she'd have killed her if she was in his place but....
Would she? She frowned at the though, if she were in Krayt's place and he in hers; he giving up the people that would have had her killed by someone she felt for she...she'd be angry at them. angry at him too for his part but...he would have given them up, asked only for his crew to be spared but not himself...
*Don't. Swoon. Dammit.* her mind growled at her, damn she was such a girl sometimes, but ancestors it had more of a romantic feel when she switched their positions than in the current.
So then what was going to happen? Surely he wouldn't still want her as his anchor that...he...the dark side and...*you know what brain how about we just shut up and wait.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 16:37:09)

Darth Krayt now sat in his throne. Once he was settled his head slowly turned to Daiyu. **"Commodore, establish contact with Roan Fel. Tell them to come to me. Or I will get them."**
He then took a moment to stretch out with the Force and analyzed Daiyu's thoughts. A slightly muffled chuckle emanated from Krayt's menacing helmet. **"You're afraid? They put you into this didn't they? Was it….Malificere? He told me he wanted me dead. Now, call to them."**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emperor Roan Fel heard Darth Malificere speak of their options. **"A secret passage? This is the Sith capital, I was hoping you'd know a way. I'm still not even sure this is your trap you've set for me. I could just leave you to yourselves. And why did the Commodore shut off her comlink after we heard Darth Krayt order a full alert? This was your idea. On Bastion you didn't offer us much in the planning phase and you seem hesitant now. Are you waiting for Krayt to find us?!"**
The Emperor turned back from the tunnel. He began to keep further distance from the Sith.

### **zerah** (2013-01-27 17:32:02)

Daiyu sighed softly as she fingered the comlink "It was Fel." she said simply "and the knights. Once they found out I spent so much time with you, about the proposals, about how…" she paused, her throat closing over the words *'how I feel about you'* she thought back over the meeting and scowled at herself, she had been so sure they had been right. That he had manipulated her and everything but you know what? "They told me that my time with you had been a type of abuse, manipulation, that my mind wasn't my own any longer that I had been betrayed by you." She scowled at the comlink, moving to the window slowly "They manipulated me as well…all of us into thinking this was the right thing…" she made a noise of disgust "Stupid girl." she muttered and lifted the com, turning it back and stared out the window.
Screw all of this, screw them all, she was a damn strong woman not some pet or weak thing, she stood up to two Sith and won, she had the loyalty of her crew and she had a championship in shock boxing to her name as well as the title of duchess! She knew her mind, her master was proud of her and she'd be damned if she let anyone get away with making her feel like shit again.
Her gaze narrowed and she took a few breathes, making herself sound breathy, putting a faint whimper through first and gulping "Th…this is Daiyu." she let her voice tremble as though she'd been crying "I…I…" she choked a sob, letting the idea of the words *'I failed'* come across instead of the words "He…he wants you to come to the temple..all of you… he…" she took a breath, letting the sound of it carry over, that she was trying to stay strong "He's said you have to come to the temple, or he will come for you." She paused, letting the silence carry "It's over…" she said softly, defeat in her tone.
She looked at herself in the glass of the window, no tears, no fear; she was angry, tired of being used and pulled in one way or another. Tired of the manipulation from all ends, why did no one seem to see but here that there was always a better way. "Please come…" she said again, watching her face; the impassive and cold of her own eyes didn't match the quiver of fear that came from her lips.
Screw them all.

Maleficere blinked with surprise at the Emperor. "**Do you honestly think I would begin to be able tos et up this whole thing?! I've only ever been to this planet once! The majority of that time I had a damn worm put inside myself..**" He quickly moved to follow the Emperor, and looked around for the best way to go. His head swam though at the question of Daiyu. There were only two explanations. "**I cannot, however, vouch for the Commodore any longer. She has either just now betrayed us and favored the men over the cause…Or she has been captured and tortured into doing this. Either way, it is bad for us all."**
At that point he snapped. The dark side filling his emotions as he thought about what would happen if this was a proper betrayel. HE was the rightful Emperor, not Fel, and certainly not Krayt. Moving ahead of the Emperor he drew Palpatine's lightsaber, ignited it and took a defensive stance to protect Fel as they moved forward. "**Rest assured…Invictus and I will not go down without a fight."**
(Waiting to see about Daiyu's post to see if she needs to use computer before I add anything else)

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 17:57:57)

Darth Krayt saw the emotion in Daiyu's voice and approached her calmly. He placed his hands gently on the comlink...trying to relax her. Krayt had no smile to offer, just a look that showed he understood her pain.
**"It's not easy living with the Dark Side. To be fair, I have put a tremendous burden on your shoulders…as well as Malificere's and Invictus'. I believed you all could handle it. Now I'm starting to believe that you can."**
He gave her a moment alone and then proclaimed. **"Hopefully they will abide to our summons. Then we shall get to the heart of this matter. I have more answers for you….but not yet. We will wait for them. You may not like what I have to say, but all I offer is the truth."**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emperor Roan Fel ceased his communication with the Sith as he heard Daiyu reactivate her comlink. He asked the Sith to come closer to listen to the message. He was cautious of the activated lightsabers.
> &quot;Th&#8230;this is Daiyu.&quot; she let her voice tremble as though she&#39;d been crying &quot;I&#8230;I&#8230;&quot; she choked a sob, letting the idea of the words &#39;I failed&#39; come across instead of the words &quot;He&#8230;he wants you to come to the temple..all of you&#8230; he&#8230;&quot; she took a breath, letting the sound of it carry over, that she was trying to stay strong &quot;He&#39;s said you have to come to the temple, or he will come for you.&quot; She paused, letting the silence carry &quot;It&#39;s over&#8230;&quot; she said softly, defeat in her tone.
> She looked at herself in the glass of the window, no tears, no fear; she was angry, tired of being used and pulled in one way or another. Tired of the manipulation from all ends, why did no one seem to see but here that there was always a better way. &quot;Please come&#8230;&quot;

The Emperor shook his head. **"By the Force! You Sith had better explain why she couldn't kill Darth Krayt! She had the advantage! Now I expect an explanation. Or you two will find yourselves on your own…"**
The Emperor turned away and sighed, **"What a fine state of affairs. I'm considering surrender. Perhaps the Dark Side clouded my judgment on Bastion. I suppose it is a fate I have earned listening to the Sith and not my own most trusted comrades."**

### **zerah** (2013-01-27 18:21:33)

Daiyu turned to him, turning the link off again and sighed "I don't believe in the dark side as the only option." she said "I know it's part of life, I get that, but there are other options, not everything has to fall to the side of shadows." She smiled faintly, slightly bitter but there was no hint of the emotions she had just faked over the com on her person "I'm stronger than people seem to give me credit for." she motioned her head to the com "So are Alvar and Invictus."
She frowned "I think we forgot that…use to being told what to do, being left in the dark and having to hope for something to cling to that the next idea to give us a notion of a better life looks like the sun coming out…" She frowned and looked up at him again "I'm tired of fake sun." she stated blandly.
Her gaze drifted to the view of the city again, lightly taking his hand, she wasn't afraid anymore; she needed to be stronger and be herself, needed to stop clinging to others words and start using the damn brain she had. She survived so much believing in herself and working for herself and for those she cared about. She didn't need others thinking for her and if she wanted people to listen then they'd listen if she had to put a blaster to their head.
"Do you remember what it feels like to be in the sun?" she asked, a metaphor for the light, she hoped he understood that "I don't think Alvar or Invictus do." Her head tiled to the side in thought and hummed "I do." she remembered the feel of her father's arms around her as she fell into unconsciousness on Krayts floor, the warmth of pride in her from her master, the sense of belonging from her crew when she protected them.
She nodded to herself then, coming to some kind of decision in her head
"I'm going to help you. You, Alvar and even Invictus. I'm going to help you feel the sun again. you keep telling me that the dark side must rule the galaxy to achieve true balance in the force…Light has to remain as well. I think that's balance, to know which is right at what time." She turned slightly to look at him smirking "You'll all feel the light again, even if it's small…Even if I have to drag you all kicking and screaming."
No, she may not marry him...she may not marry at all, but she'd anchor him. She'd do that for him. For all of them.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 18:31:08)

**"Your concern is noted. I once knew the sun. The burning Binary Suns of Tatooine, raised by mindless animals. The life of the Sand People."**
Darth Krayt smiled and continued speaking. **"Yes, some light must remain. But no one truly wants the light. They always want the comfort of the darkness to hide and rest in. When the light no longer serves the self they retreat into the shadows for safety, to conceal their true nature. At least that is true for the majority. The ones who truly serve the Light, will find a way to live and burn brightly through the shadows. These select few will find a way despite the shroud of the Dark Side, and rightfully so. But the ones who choose to retreat to the shadows when convenient, shall have that wish granted. They deserve the darkness for all time."**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-27 18:36:41)

Maleficere looked coldly at Roan Fel before he deactivated his saber and glared at him, moving to Invictus' side. "**I understand your mistrust of myself and Invictus, but your life is in our hands. What more choice do you have than to trust us? Sure you could kill us if you wanted, but something tells me that Krayt would execute you for taking that pleasure away from him….Invictus and I are going to the temple to meet him head on. You can either follow us, or save yourself while we meet with him. I'm tired of this entire venture. You ask why you listened to us when you should have listened to your comrades? If you HAD listened to ME then we would not be in this situation. I told you to NOT give Daiyu the task. I told you we should persue another course of action, the Death Star. Your comrades and your clouded judgement were the VERY reason that this failed, by putting someone who cares for Krayt in direct contact with him. From now on, I do things my way.**" He then turned and opened his comm. "**Daiyu. Invictus and I are on our way."** There were no falterings in his voice, for once...he was committed. " **He spoke over his shoulder as he made his way towards the temple. "**If I were you, I would quickly make up my mind as to whether you will stay…or come with us."****

### **zerah** (2013-01-27 18:48:45)

Daiyu nodded and chuckled "I rather liked the sun best, it was always warmer…and more of a challenge to sneak around in." She looks to her com at the sudden voice and smiles "Seems they've chosen as well at least." She hums thoughtfully "You know…Fel wanted you dead by any means, but by the sounds of things he doesn't know what he wants anymore…"
She hummed again "Maybe he never did, taking council from others but blinded by it, complacent in it, unwilling to be mindful of himself maybe..." She turns her face up to Krayts "Power needs to shift. He's not light, he's not the better ideals of the Empire, he's a man who's forgotten everything that makes the Empire great, and that darkness had made us strong." She leans into his arm for a moment, a small warm smile gracing her lips as she thought back to how at ease it feels again like this, like it had been during her stay with him.
"Light isn't just sun you know though, it's not for mindless beasts and creatures that don't know what to do with it…it's a balm."  She smirks, yes it was... "It's a balm for those that don't know the value of shadows, it's for those that need reassurance." She motions to the room as she turns to look it over "The Jedi had ideas about it, some of them good." She gave his hand a squeeze to stop him from speaking "They had some good ideas, their ideas brought people to their side because of what the light stood for and what they made the dark look like." she chuckles faintly, an idea striking her as she grinned; oh...wouldn't that be something...use the Jedi's old ways against the new light.
Give the people of light reason to trust the dark, the same things the light does to turn the dark areas against their own kind and place in them the seeds of doubt..she wondered how fast the war could be won with simple acts of kindness, seeds of doubt, and the people doing all the work.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Undercity Sewers Level B1**</span>
**"Listened to you? This entire operation was your idea to kill Darth Krayt. You summoned me to destroy Krayt for your ambitions. What other way would you want to kill a single man? By wiping out an entire planet? We were prepared to offer support to your Death Star project, that's why we made written authorization. If you didn't want Daiyu to commit to the attack solely; you certainly didn't offer any alternatives. You remained mostly silent in the planning phase. You offered no specifics on any alternate course of action, you let us do the work for your own plan. So you share most of the blame. I thank you for your aid in attempting to kill Lord Krayt. But you can face him on your own. I won't follow a egotistical Sith who is blinded by his own legacy to the point of complacency to his own demise. The only reason I would go up there is for Daiyu. Her destiny lies on a better path than yours. If I were you, I'd listen to every word she said when you face Krayt."**
With that, the Emperor began to slowly back away toward the right-most tunnel, keeping his eyes focused on the Sith. It became evident they were going to lose a valuable asset to lose Krayt. Regardless of who was right or wrong in their debate. The Emperor would have no part in this. He was going to take his chances alone. He left a datapad on the ground which contained the map to the Jedi Temple.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 19:13:23)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Jedi High Council Chamber</span>**
Darth Krayt listened closely to what the Commodore had to say. **"Well now Fel will be in my custody. I will get everything I need to know from him. His men follow the Imperial Viewpoint solely, but fail to realize the Imperial Viewpoint was originally created by a man guided by the Dark Side. That is the fault in their government. It is a very basic yet critical failure on their part. Nevertheless, they remain strong. The 501st joining Fel was a tremendous loss to our Empire. Now this might stop more from betraying the Sith. But yes, you're right…there must also be hope gleaming on the horizon. One day my Empire will be able to provide that."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-01-27 19:34:42)

Daiyu smirked at that, moving from his side, letting her head trail out of his and moved to the throne he had made for her, just touching the arm of it with a wry sort of grin. Her Empire too, maybe not in the same sense but she loved her Empire. She looked back at him, determined "We'll get back the 501st. They just need to be reminded what strength really is." she nodded at him "You'll need Alvar for it you know…and you know that he'd be a good ally don't you?"
She paused here and looked at him curiously "Earlier you had mentioned Skywalker escaping…" she said softly "Who…" she frowned "what Skywalker?"

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 19:50:11)

The Emperor was pacing about, armor shifting constantly with slight metallic grinding. **"He's been a good ally. I read his dossier. He performed near Genius level aptitude at the Academy and has demonstrated Orator skills that are perhaps better than Palpatine's. He rooted out and destroyed an Alliance Remnant base on his first assignment. The man also endured two years of vicious training by my own hand. We've seen the evidence of him bearing lineage to Palpatine. I want him to take that destiny, if he can. If he must destroy me to do so, then I wish it. I would gladly accept death at his hands. If he had only the power to do so. Emperor Palpatine's rule, however short, proved to be one of the most peaceful times in the galaxy. With only scarce engagements by the Rebel Alliance in remote locations. Nowhere near as damaging as the Clone Wars."** 
He then turned and let out a slight sneer at the mention of Skywalker. **"Cade Skywalker. As it's known, the Skywalker lineage has shown the greatest affinity to the Force ever known. He would be a powerful ally to my Empire. But, after I've met you three. Now that I think about it….I need a moment. Excuse me, I will check on the security protocols."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-01-27 19:57:00)

Daiyu nodded her head to him, bowing slightly as he might pass her and moving to the view of the city again, taking a seat on the floor with a sigh, side to the window and head resting against it.
Cade Skywalker.
There was a skywalker still alive. One that carried the name and the power and everything. If she was really skywalker too...that meant she had family...a cousin?
Maybe she could read up on this...Cade. Maybe he'd be willing to come over to them..maybe just to listen, if she could prove the same family tree.
Family...she might actually have family...
No. she had family, they were all dead now. Alvar and Invictus and Niles, they were still alive, still family. Her crew was family. Cade though...he could be part of that. They could all be together! He could tell her about Luke...
*I wonder where he is.*

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-27 20:06:32)

Maleficere had a fleeting thought of a snarky comment but held his tongue. "**What if I asked you, Fel…to come with me? If you plead your case to Krayt then perhaps maybe things can be settled. Otherwise you know he will never stop hunting you…He could even use your own daughter against you if he wished…"** He continued walking but talked loud enough for the man to hear him. **Why not listen to my council now? If you tell him that -I- convinced you to surrender…I can almost guarantee that he will be lenient. Your daughter can rule in your stead, she seems strong enough…"**

The Emperor shook his head. **"I suppose if I come forth as a prisoner we may have some sort of advantage. As you said, I have no chance of escape anyways. But I'm sure to die. However, I wouldn't be out here if I wasn't ready to die."** He stepped forward and surrendered his elegantly designed lightsaber. **"Perhaps, I can only hope this is the Will of the Force. I'll lead the way to the temple…it's about 120 meters to the lift ahead."**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-27 20:41:18)

Maleficere nodded gratefully and slowly took the lightsaber, quickly holstering it plus his own. He looked to Fel with respect. **"I will do what I can for us…Please, lead the way."** He looked to Invictus with a smile, timid as it was because he was nervous as hell...But at least he had convinced Fel to not abandon them. And so they all walked towards the Temple.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 20:50:39)

The trio took a short walk and a left turn to a crude control console and lift in which they summoned it. It took them to the Undercity where they encountered various beggars, drug dealers, and many others types of scum and villainy. They found a main lift to the brisk and civilized upper levels of Coruscant's Capital Sector. They were now walking the streets amongst many politicians, a few Sith, stormtroopers, and intergalatic businessmen. Most of them appeared to be human, unlike the Undercity. After walking past many buildings of eloquent design they saw the Jedi Temple looming into view and its singular entry way to the Temple, its grand staircase. The group began walking up the stairs when they saw a team of four Dark Troopers who saluted the Sith. The trio told them that Lord Krayt was waiting for them and immediately the Troopers took a defensive posture and began escorting the three men to Jedi High Council Chamber.
There was no doubt all three of you were carrying a terrible smell with you as you entered the polished durasteel doors. But at least the sunlight was shining through the transparisteel lift and you could smell the scrubbed air coming in. After a short walk down the main hallway. The doors open to behold the sight you had been dreading or anxious of.
Darth Krayt turned to the three and straightened his shoulders out. **"So, you finally decided to stop dithering about and come before me. Now Malificere, Commodore Daiyu tells me that Fel had a plot to kill me. Is she lying?"**
Malificere eyes immediately noticed Daiyu in Krayt's presence, she was unharmed.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-27 21:01:57)

Maleficere did indeed notice that Daiyu was unharmed....and that made him all the more uncomfortable with this whole situation. The young sith turned to Krayt and said **"Lord Krayt…Would it be simpler to say that the plan existed all along? You had a plot to kill him, he had a plot to kill you. To answer you directly though…I hardly did any of the planning. He and his council did the majority, though I was instrumental in putting even that in his head. Yet…for all of this, I do believe that this presents us all with a unique situation…"** He turned to Daiyu with a smirk **"Wouldn't you agree…?"** He moved from Fel to stand a ways away, yet somewhat close to Daiyu. **"Afterall, it is because of me he stands before you.

Daiyu lifted her head from the glass at the entrance, not bothering to stand. She had a small measure of respect for who Fel was, but not what he stood for. Not anymore, she had no reason to stand for him; she did offer a little wave though to the two Sith, smirking faintly at them and nodding her head.
She was so tired suddenly, ancestors she needed to sleep. Actual sleep, not like that stress ridden parody of the notion she had attempted to get earlier. She let her head fall back to the glass again, relaxed really as she watched.
Against everything, despite the people the room that would be able to kill her with a thought, she was so very much relaxed around Krayt and Alvar...funny, she only realized now that Fel was the only one that had made her uneasy. Funny.
"I think this is a very unique position to be in." She comments simply, looking to Krayt to gauge his emotions from body language

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 21:35:00)

Darth Krayt let out a genuine smile. Finally, the one who called himself Emperor was before him.
**"Now then…Fel….what am I going to do with you? Of course, you're going to suffer a slow, painful death. I want to know everything. You probably won't tell me everything I need to know. But I have special techniques to get something out of you. I happen to be close acquaintances to the Yuuzhan Vong shapers who can rape you of your very soul. I will get my answers."**
The Emperor Roan Fel looked at Darth Malificere. **"You worthless pile of slime! You said you wanted Krayt dead! I felt it in the Force, your hate towards him! You wanted to kill him and you would have if this plan would have succeeded! I fell victim to your art of Dun Moch. But by the Force I swear I saw it in your soul you wanted Krayt dead on this day! You won't get away with this!"**
Darth Krayt stopped as he heard what Roan Fel had to say, then turned to Malificere.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-27 21:50:31)

Maleficere gave off a scoff before looking to Fel **"Fel…You are a wise man. You know the Sith strive to kill their masters to better themselves, to immerse themselves to the Dark Side."** Still looking to Fel, he now spoke directly to Krayt. "**I know fully well that punishment may still be awaiting me for my actions…But I assure you Lord Krayt, that any actions I would take to end you would not have been so obvious as I meant these falsities to be. When the time comes…I will try to kill you, that much is certain. For now though, we have much to attend to I believe do we not? His daughter still lives…and will rally their troops once she discovers we have her father. We must be swift in getting the information…we can not tarry here."**

Daiyu, rolled her head to look up to the ceiling, laughing silently oh..oh good ancestors he had planned the whole thing? Oh that wonderful, handsome jackass of an idiot genius.
She put her head in her hands and tried to breathe to stop from laughing. her shoulder were moving...oh wait, she was laughing..quietly, but laughing.
That ass. That damn ass, he could have let her in on things. She was still laughing, wiping at her eyes with one hand, the other covering her mouth to stop the laughter.
There was a faint strangled sounding laugh from her direction.
no wait..that was her.
wait...that was a sob.
the hell... she was crying? was she laughing? take assessment...
...
crying and laughing.
Yes she was very stressed out apparently.
She was put on the hot seat by everyone, for a plan that she had succeeded in without knowing, and made to feel like she was betraying two people she cared for when she was helping them both at the same time at the cost of her sanity. she wondered if that was manipulation before her mind just said to shut up about the damn thing.
The result was her curling her knees to her chest, making soft sounds of laughing and choked sobs that sounded like a wounded animal.

Darth Krayt lumbered forward and then grabbed Roan Fel by his throat. He lifted him from Invictus' and Malificere's grasp using his augmented Vong strength. He then squeezed his throat.
**"First, I want to know. Where is Skywalker?! I know you meet with the Alliance, and they know where he's at."**
Fel's face was turning purple and veins were bulging out of his face and neck. The ebony gauntlet continued to sink into his neck steadily.
**"K…….illl…….him!**
The three looked on as Darth Krayt began his impromptu torture session.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-27 23:19:26)

Maleficere watched with some deep fascination as well as some inane sense of disgust. At the look of Fel, and at what Fel had said...Maleficere would be a fool to kill Krayt right now. With Krayt dead, Fel would almost certainly destroy him even without a lightsaber just for the fact he had handed him over to the Sith. No, there would be no aid for Fel at this point and time. He simply stood there at attention, looking to Daiyu with some worry as to her state but quickly turned back to Fel. **"Fel…You understand that it is in your best interest? Or do we need to bring your daughter into this as well…I am sure I could devise some wonderful…activities for the both of us if need be…"**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 23:26:17)

Darth Krayt slung Roan Fel across the floor, he slid until his head bumped into a duracrete pillar. Roan Fel quickly used the Force to push himself up in a Teras Kasi like maneuver. He began to square up as Krayt approached like a giant across the length of the Jedi Council Chamber.
**"Malificere! Give me my lightsaber! I deserve my chance as a warrior to die with honor."**
**"Don't worry, you're not dying anytime soon. This is just the beginning of what I'm going to put you through. They can vouch for my Vong shaping techniques. Give me Skywalker's location! He will be a Sith!"**

### **zerah** (2013-01-27 23:38:27)

Daiyu let out a muffled sort of...snort at the mention of activities and Alvar. She wasn't even sure if was meant to be a laugh or something else anymore. Granted she wasn't entirely sure of her sanity anymore either but for the moment she attempted to steady herself and take a few deep breaths wiping at her eyes and sniffling slightly grinning like a loon and green eyes bright from all the tears.
"Stop…please.." she calls out desperately, taking a shaky step "Please…please…" She sobbed, voice breathless as she sucked one in, shaking from head to toe.
"Please tell us where Cade is." She says softly, arms hugging herself. With her eyes wide she looked broken, lost, a lost little girl.
"I've never had family.. she said quickly  "Cade…Cade's out there somewhere, he doesn't know I exist..he can't, he…he would have come for me…That's what family does they're supposed to protect eachother" She tugs at her shirt, like a little girl trying so hard to get someone to listen to her. "He's family…real…real family. Like you and your daughter, someone who can tell me what my parents were like..someone who knows.." she looked at him "Please…please…I need to know where he is, I want to make sure he's safe, I need to know that he's okay, that he's real."
She looks down "you spoke so much about my own future…he can help me, he can teach me..please…you and everyone else put me through hell, let me have this please."

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-27 23:56:35)

**"I'm not helping any of you double-crossing Sith bastards!!! Malificere! My lightsaber, now!"**
Darth Krayt was now in the center of the room, taking his time with his deliberate and stalking movements. Roan Fel looked at Daiyu. **"What do you mean family?!"**

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-28 00:05:54)

Maleficere blinked for a moment at Roan Fel before shaking his head. "**You expect me to give you your weapon? I don't think so. There is nothing in that situation that could come out to my advantage…Best to tell our master what you know. Though I am very surprised that the force did not tell you, or maybe you were too weak to realize…That Daiyu is a Skywalker?"**
Maleficere started to laugh heartily and then asked the almighty Emperor of the Sith "**Lord Krayt. May I personally punish him as well for his sheer ignorance…? You may find my help in torture to be particularly useful…."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-28 00:12:25)

**Yes, let's show him various forms of pain. You'll hurt him extremely, and I'll hurt him worse. We'll know where Skywalker is soon enough."**
Roan Fel steadied himself after taking a solid blow, and turned to face Malificere.

### **zerah** (2013-01-28 00:16:56)

Daiyu watched them, she really hadn't expected it to work, not with how hostile he was towards them all but...it had spiked his interest it seemed to know. Maybe that would be good.
She flopped back to her knees then down to sit fully on the floor, legs curled to her side as she watched them silently. She knew they'd get him to talk, and really...she'd be lying if she said this wasn't exciting.
Ancestors there must be something wrong with her, if this made her heart flutter to watch them torture someone.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-28 00:31:49)

Maleficere walked closer to their new plaything and cracked his knuckles outward with a sickening series of pops and cracks. **"You will tell us the exact location of Skywalker Fel…you will beg us for death. Your fate, however, is in Lord Krayt's hands now."** He reared back his shoulders and moved his arms back as well, letting himself be given in to the Dark Side as he tapped into the force. Throwing his hands in front of him, he aimed Force Lightning at the man before him...Hoping to cause him severe pain and torment.

As this flurry was coming forward, he looked to his right to see Darth Krayt bearing down on him. He raised his lightsaber overhead with one hand and began three slow downward strokes that were mighty in power. Between Malificere's feint and Krayt's slow powerful overhead strikes, Fel had no trouble raising his lightsaber overhead to block the strikes. However, the powerful strikes just moved Fel around with each block. It was obvious his arms were just getting extremely tired just by blocking the extremely powerful blows.

She though was still unseen for the moment as she assessed the situation.
She could run out, light her blade and take him by surprise with a saber he might not be able to attack...she might even be able to disarm him quickly. or...she could go the other route and get behind him; she could force him into a strangle hold, but that would put her in line of fire from the pair who might not be able to stop fast enough...or stop at all.
So she moved, leaving the back of the throne silently and crept closer to him, even if she couldn't get close enough to attack she could be close enough to grab his saber if one or the other disabled him.

The two Sith were using lightsaber forms to attack in tandem. It was a style of combat Invictus and Malificere had practice many times in the Yuuzhan Vong formed Undercity training grounds. It required precise timing and precognition from the Force. It was not only to defend your opponents strikes, but to avoid your ally's blade while he coordinated his attacks with you. To Malificere this was not a difficult task as he felt alive in the Dark Side as he dueled, invigorated to fight at Krayt's side perhaps. They were both breaking down their enemy with precision strikes as each parry and block made a distinctive hiss and clashing noise. Fel realized they had sensed each other's fighting style as Malificere trapped him between Krayt. He realized now this battle would be much tougher. Fel unleashed a quick two strikes at each men and then back stepped away from the Sith smothering him with attacks.

As Malificere lunged forward with his father's electrum lightsaber, Roan Fel parried it away in a smooth circular motion. Malificere noticed that Roan Fel had become increasingly serene....as if he was already resigned to his fate. It had aided him on the defensive despite his weariness from the duel that waged against his favor. He was seeing clearly with the Force and ridding himself of emotion.

Daiyu shifted her footing to make sure she wasn't in line of attack of the other two fighters. She knew she wasn't on their level in the force, she hadn't the training for it but she had gotten better with her blade.
That didn't seem like it was going to matter much though. Narrowing her gaze she gripped her saber hilt and watched Fel. "He knows the outcome of this fight." She says conversational, frowning slightly. "You plan to draw this out enough that one move will end you if you don't move away don't you?" 
She sighs faintly, "do you believe yourself in the position of Lord Vader and Jedi Master Kanobi? Do you fancy this battle to be remembered in history? Do you think you'll be remembered with grace and honor because you fought well?" She questioned, taking a step back and testing a hand to her hip "Do you really believe that, that is what will leave here? Not that you held information secret that could strengthen the Empire, that you selfishly wished your own power over the Empire, that you met with Alliance…that you protect a fugitive and you may even be harboring said fugitive." She smiled cruelly then " or maybe…that you sympathise with the Alliance, Do you send secrets to them? Do you share numbers and plans with them? Do you harbor criminals to the Empire in exchange for something?"
She clicks her tongue "You have no honor do you. No love for what the Empire is. Traitor. Disgrace."

Roan Fel listened to her words. He nodded his head and deactivated his lightsaber. He tossed it to Lord Krayt's feet. The Dark Lord simply crushed it with his left greave.
**"I submit."**
Darth Krayt let loose a small smile and then laughed at Daiyu. **"You will make a fine Empress yet. I knew you to always be quite the orator when required."**
Darth Krayt deactivated his lightsaber and attached it to his hip. **"Now my minions and my Empress…what matter of pain shall we inflict to get him to speak? I'm interested as to what your minds can conjure up, seeing as how you despise this worthless traitor to our ways as much as you do."**
His stare did not leave Fel as the man hunched over in pain, taking in deep breaths and perhaps his last respite.

Maleficere moved his saber to out in front of him, the red glow casting an eerie light over his face. **"I say…that you let me use this saber to inflict burns all over his body…I am able to use it with surgical expertise…as I once saved the life of Darth Invictus by cauterizing his wounds…Please my Lord…let me have the honor of gleaning the information from him…"** He then grew an even more wild smile. **"Or we could do the same to his daughter…She would after all only pick up where he left off…"**

### **zerah** (2013-01-29 16:50:34)

Daiyu sighed faintly, glad that it had worked and the damned traitorous fool saw reason. She frowned at the Sith to the side and moved to Fel, putting her saber back on its hiding place on her person and took Fel's arm, moving him away from the viewpoint with a hand to his back in support, helping him sit against the side wall instead and kneeling down beside him.
"He surrendered, he see's the truth in words and has chosen to keep what honor he has." She looks up to them both, "we will acknowledge that and give him his chance to speak the information he has in return for an honorable death of our choosing."
She looks back to Fel, "you only have one chance of this, one chance for kindness and honor to afforded to you. Tell us where Cade is."

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-30 00:14:04)

Roan Fel, dressed in his ragged clothes and sweat pushed away from Commodore Daiyu. He did not sit down, despite the apparent shakiness in his knees. He backed away from the viewport and did his best to stand tall away from the Sith.
**"Do not try and coddle me! You confided some trust in me on Bastion. Of this I am sure. Now your dastardly tongue is trying to glean more information out of me. I won't listen to it! So keep your filthy hands off me you Hutt slime! I'd rather take a mauling from both of these Sith than have your slimy paws on me! I surrendered. Do what you want with me! But you'll get nothing out of me. I will endure any type of pain for the TRUE Empire, one that is not clouded by the emotions of the Dark Side. The Empire that is objective and clear."**
Darth Krayt laughed at the sight. But while this was occurring, a voice echoed in the Force. It went straight into Malificere's head.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-30 10:19:31)

Maleficere looked to Fel for a moment before moving towards Krayt, standing almost next to him. "**If you have truly surrendered…Then why did you -just now- use the Force to tell me to secure your escape..or else?"** He looked to Daiyu with a soft smile **"You see Daiyu? You see how the enemy acts even in defeat? I admire his tenacity, of that I know for certain…"** He looked to Krayt for a moment, almost as if asking him silently what he would like him to do.

### **zerah** (2013-01-30 10:31:10)

Daiyu was upset to be called such things, she wasn't a traitor to the true Empire, she remembered what the true Empire was about, what it stood for, how it was built.
She'd passed through the trials, she had received the red robe, she knew the history and the lessons. How dare he call her anything. And he shunned her as well, fool.
She stood and moved away from him with a click of her tongue "Fool." Really what other word for him was there? She offered him honor and the possibility of a quick death, a warrior's death for information and he spurned that? tch, fool.
She paused in her steps away from him, crossing her arms over her chest "I offer you so much, but you've chosen your path. And you continue make things worse by threatening him?" she motioned to Alvar and shook her head, waving a dismissive hand at him.
"Fine, have it your way then."  She moved a bit more away, turning her back on the most unimportant person in the room. She took a seat near Krayt's throne to watch, resting her head on her closed fist propped up on her leg. She watched faintly than turned curious eyes onto Krayt "Is it possible to cut someone off from the force?" she asked conversationally, disregarding the other man completely now "I wonder if that would be painful…" she mused.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-30 12:46:40)

Maleficere watched Daiyu with a look of surprise and pride. She was more ruthless than he had given her credit for, she was delightfully sinister in this moment. He flashed her a smile of approval before looking to Krayt and whispered to him, feeling that although Daiyuw as on the right rack...they would not get anywhere with Fel.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"My lord. It is clear that he is resolved in his defiance. Could we not invade his mind and force information out of him that way? I still stand by the fact that if we kidnap his daughter, he will be more than willing to talk…It would also give us another piece of scum to interrogate. The fear of the other getting hurt, or worse, could possibly get both to open up and give us everything. I say we take him prisoner, give him to the shapers. He will cry out for his daughter with the force and deliver her to us in a moment of weakness. Or…we could even negotiate for information. Offer them his safe return for the required intel, then kill him once he is no longer of any use. The possibilities are endless really. Either way, the longer he lives the longer he remains their leader…with or without the force. I await your command."

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-30 16:07:04)

Darth Krayt listened to Malificere and Daiyu as Fel stood up just a little bit taller. He was pleased with all the options for Fel's demise he was hearing. **"To sever one's connection to the Force is an ability that is unique and generally only practiced by Jedi. He can have all of the Force the wants, since he is about to become one with it. By the way, how do you like your throne….prospective Empress?"**
He then walked over to his throne and prepared to thumb a com-switch on his the control panel. **"Bring me Yuuzlak Kwa'ad. Prepare the Chamber of Offering."**
He then looked up to Malificere. **"Princess Marasiah Fel? His daughter?"** He questioned with an evil laugh. Roan Fel looked on helpless but remained as calm as possible, likely searching the Force for answers. **"My minion…can it be done? Can we have his daughter brought before us? She can endure whatever you can conjure up as a reward if that notion is brought to fruition."**
Roan Fel looked away, he looked through the viewport to appear inconspicuous. At that moment, another voice echoed in Malificere's head.

### **zerah** (2013-01-30 16:56:23)

Daiyu looked over to her throne, standing to get a better look at it. Fel was out of her mind for the moment now, not a concern of hers. She trailed a hand long the electrum of the seat, lightly touching the jewels and smiled faintly.
It was elegant, but simple.
She smiles just a little more, a bit of warmth in her gaze as she took in what might be hers, a place, a voice, a say in things.
"I love it…" She said softly bit enough to be heard, looking over to them.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-30 17:06:37)

Maleficere raised an eyebrow to Fel before giving a smirk. The only secrets that he could remember...were the plans for the Death Star, and Krayt was told about those during their first meeting. So he shrugged that off as an empty threat before turning to Krayt. **"I will see it done then my Lord. It, unless told otherwise, will be my top priority."**
He looked back to Daiyu with a smile before placing his hood over his head. It was a bit cold in the room and while it -had- been quite agreeable, he decided that he liked the shade better that it brought to his eyes. **"Stay out of my head Fel, while you still have yours."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-30 17:17:45)

> &quot;Stay out of my head Fel, while you still have yours.&quot;

Roan Fel was attempting everything to control his fear, and his anger. In the presence of hopelessness and darkness it was not easy. Darth Krayt gave a bemused look at Malificere's warning to Fel.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-30 17:30:25)

Maleficere rolled his eyes before looking to Fel with a seriously annoyed look. The look spoke of promised pain if he continued to speak in his head. He could have cared less about what the man told Krayt, there was really nothing that was not known at this point. **"My Lord does this scum need any hands or legs for this…ceremony that you have planned? I am itching to teach him a lesson for invading my head but would ask your permission first."**

### **zerah** (2013-01-30 17:30:54)

Daiyu looked over to the younger Sith and the fallen emperor with a frown, watching the latter closely. He was making threats? Promises maybe?
She watched him more, nuances I'm movement, twitches, all easy tells if someone knew how to look for them. If he was making threats or promises then that must mean he was desperate...or perhaps...perhaps he was finally feeling how hopeless his situation was.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-30 23:09:10)

Lord Krayt noticed that Malificere was eager to hurt Roan Fel. He completely understood. Emperor Roan Fel was the biggest opposition to his war after all. But Darth Krayt had to suppress his Dark Side emotions and get everything he could out of him. After all, that gave him time to savor the exquisite downfall of his long-term enemy. Lord Krayt gestured with his long arm to stand down.
**"We'll get to that soon enough. Once my shaper arrives we will all take him to the Coral Undercity, a place you know all too well Malificere. So where one of my promising minions were born, my sworn enemy shall perish."** 
Malificere couldn't forget the hell of a place that the Yuuzhan Vong thrived in. There were still Vong formed parts of Coruscant from the Vong Invasion, but Darth Krayt allowed a select few Yuuzhan Vong to serve his needs. Their structures were constructed from coral, with living bio-formed creatures slithering across their buildings in a disgusting and revolting sheen. The floors were living as well, and sunk in with each step. Any Vong chamber smelled terrible, and the food always made him sick...but somehow it sustained him. He remembered being in the living chambers of Vong breeding grounds for various types of organisms that were extremely putrid by most species standards. How he had waded in a dark green gelatinous substance of revolting proportions that somehow nourished the harvesting fields of Vong creatures. He and Invictus had lived with a species that cherished pain, knew only war, and did so under the harshest of conditions. Was Fel that deserving of a fate? In retrospect, his training to a Sith would pale in comparison to Fel's torture...because Krayt would most likely kill Fel soon.
As Malificere might ponder this, Commodore Daiyu observed Roan Fel. She noticed something particular to those trained in the art of the Force. It was not a Dark Side technique, but looked closer to a Jedi technique. He was becoming serene, allowing his body to relax. Commodore Daiyu knew he was searching the Force for an answer, with extreme clarity. If anyone was capable of finding a way, it was Emperor Roan Fel. Then, she heard an echo in her head as well.

Maleficere did indeed not forget that place. How could he?? It still haunted his memories, his dreams, his every thought at least some part out of the day or nights...and he did not envy Fel's fate in the slightest. He did however feel that Fel deserved anything he got. The idiot was blind when he didn't listen to a single word that -anyone- said, including those he claimed to have trusted the most. This was his own damned fault.
He stood down though at the command of Krayt, a bit disappointed, but started to begin planning on how to get Fel's daughter to come into their web of schemes. The Dark Side had a purpose for them all and he would fulfill his to the best of his abilities.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-31 00:07:12)

Darth Malificere began to think of his training back to the Imperial Academy. There were some possibilities to lure a target but you must know what would cause that target to commit themselves (possibly alone) that could cost them their lives. Roan Fel was certainly out of the question of a target. But did Roan Fel know anyone else that might concern her? Did she have someone else she cared about deeply they could capture? Even if he was to use a person as bait; she was neutral, loyal, and would not allow her emotions to cloud her judgment. Or would she? She was still young. Perhaps Roan Fel would give information about someone she cared deeply about. Ah, there was that possibility. She wanted victory for the True Empire. Princess Marasiah Fel was now informed of the Death Star blueprints that existed. If Malificere allowed the information to be leaked that Roan Fel had been captured and betrayed...that might rally the Imperial Knights. Especially if she was informed that Roan Fel "knew" the location of the Death Star plans before becoming captured.
The Imperial Knights might take great interest in the Superweapon. If that information was leaked through clandestine channels to the Imperial Knights there was a chance it could be secured; she might personally lead the team to secure the blueprints. However, getting her to come alone would be a task in itself. Furthermore, if she wasn't alone, it would likely be a battle of itself of Naval, Duelist, and Infantry scale to get to the Princess. In the strategist mind of Darth Malificere, baiting would seem most effective. However, the actual task of securing the Princess would require top-notch planning, great execution, and a plausible strategem to lure her out.
**"I sense your feelings to search for the Princess are strong, my minion. Tell me why this is so?"**

### **Maldoravia** (2013-01-31 09:39:16)

Maleficere thought long and hard with a furrowed brow. This would take a very elaborate plan, and perhaps maybe even some serious meditation...and a serious amount of Caf. He was suddenly jerked from his thoughts by Krayt and he turned to answer him. **"I believe that she may have more intel than Roan Fel. She is his daughter…and may have secrets of her own that could prove useful. In addition my lord, the daughter of your hated enemy in our hands…Does that not have a certain appeal? It would also bring us one step closer to crushing their pitiful and pathetic attempt at an Empire. With both so-called Emperor and Empress in our grasp…they will be leaderless."** He had to admit, this was all so very exciting...

### **zerah** (2013-01-31 12:38:16)

Daiyu watched from afar the body language of the fallen man, curious of his actions. Her head tilted to the side slightly in thought. How was he doing that? She didn't know much on the force or many techniques but that....didn't feel..like the two Siths..
He was...is?...was, was an Emperor to the Empire, on the wrong side yes, but...still...he understood that the Empire had been built by Sith, ruled by Sith, but he...he wasn't a Sith...he used the force and this odd technique, but..
was he a Jedi in disguise?
how could that be? in a room surrounded by Imperial Knights, was it possible that he was Jedi? did that mean that the knight's were Jedi too? or did they all have the same training?
*'You must safeguard me'*
She looked up from where her gaze had fallen, when had she looked away?, and stared at the fallen man. Curiosity clear on her face. She wanted to hear what he had to say, but...she made it clear in her expression, and did her best to convey the emotion with the word;
*"Why"* She thought through the force, putting the disbelief there as well, why would she help him when he had spurned her help not moments before. Why would she help him when he didn't understand what was best.

Darth Krayt nodded to the ideal of having the heir to the Emperor throne in their possession. **"If you can do so, then I shall grant you the means to accomplish that task. My primary concern now is Emperor Fel, Cade Skywalker, and if he has any contingency units left here on Coruscant. At any rate, you are proving most valuable as an asset to the order of the One Sith."**
Yuuzak Kwa'ad came into the room. She was a female, as most Vong Shapers were. It was typical of their caste system for women to fill such a role as some type of "sadistic" caretaker. Though humanoid in appearance, their features were nothing short of atrocious. Her facial skin was lifted back bearing her full teeth. The facial features were ruined by having two wires on a shoulder apparatus pulling her face back by the top of her head. They were deformed by human standards, and most other species' standards for that matter. They endured self-mutilation as homage to their Gods. She wore a black Vonduun Crab dress that was plated with black bio scales. Her hair was similar to humans in a jet black pony tail. She bowed to Darth Krayt. After this, a cadre of Darktroopers entered and applied binders to Roan Fel's wrists. He did not resist.
**"My liege, this way. We have prepared the Chamber of Offering for you."**
Roan Fel heard this and shut his eyes, he had received Daiyu's message. Once again, an echo was heard through the Force in Daiyu's mind.

Roan Fel: *"I will reveal all you two told me."*

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-31 16:55:21)

The Darktroopers gave a shove to Roan Fel with their bulky E-11 styled weapons at the order from Lord Krayt. It was time to move to Coral City, in the lower levels of Coruscant...beyond the Capital Sector.
The group traveled out of the pristine halls of the Jedi Temple and moved through the city streets, next to the towering skyscrapers. All passerby of aristocratic or military personnel made sure to either render honors or make way for the entourage. As they moved along the awe inspiring sights, Commodore Daiyu did have something to think about. Would Roan Fel really tell everything to Krayt they had said at Bastion? Did any of that information matter? She wasn't sure. After all, Darth Krayt had one of his most valuable targets. Anything said by Fel might be irrelevant unless it was something Darth Krayt wanted to hear.
Then, they were back in the Undercity. A better contrast than the Undercity sewers, but not by much. It had it's share of beggars, drug dealers, and criminals who were likely seeking haven. Most people felt the Undercity was not worth the trouble, as pollution had already affected it were it would take a tremendous amount of resources to reverse the negative effects. After a brisk 20 minute or so walk, you began seeing Bio formed substances sporadically covering the buildings. It was just part of what was left of the Vong Invasion. It was a bio engineered scar on the architectural marvel that was Coruscant. Or to some purist, they might see it as a way to breathe life into an extremely industrialized planet. However, once deeper within Coral City, you were in the subterranean levels.
A dark bio luminescent green energy was cast as light as you walked through the living tunnels of Vong architecture. A membrane-esque door slid open repulsively as if to "see" your presence. The chamber revealed a multitude of Vong operating tables. There were small living "vines" protuding from the bottom of the floor, which slithered away once you stood near them. Fel was ordered strapped to one of the operation tables. Darth Krayt then turned to Commodore Daiyu, Malificere, and Invictus. **"Begin the interrogation. Ask him whatever you deem relevant. However, we must know Cade's position. Don't kill him or induce a comatose state. We need him to be able to talk. I will check on the High Alert status, see if we have discovered any Imperial Knights around our sector. The Shapers will handle the rest."**
Darth Krayt exited via the membrane exit way. Then Roan Fel looked to his inquisitors. **"I'm not telling you anything about Skywalker. But as I warned you, I'd advise you interrogate me with caution. I have certain information Krayt might like to hear. That might information might serve to be ill-mannered towards your cause. I'm not sure."** He whispered the last three sentences as so the Shapers would not hear. What information could he be referring to?

### **zerah** (2013-01-31 17:22:42)

Daiyu moved to Fel once they were all alone, tilting her head to the side with a raised brow "and…what exactly could you say that would be so important? that…he doesn't already know?" She motions towards the door "How can you be certain that any information you have, or that you think you have is new? that any information of us or about us, or from us, is not already known and therefore unimportant to him?" 
She stepped back and frowned, walking around him "you know I really didn't want it to come to this." said lightly with a sigh "I really didn't. I might not respect your Empire, I may think your knights are pompous ass's, and I might think that you're going about things all wrong." She paused a moment, then nodded "But, I had some respect for you as a person. You genuinely wanted what was best for the galaxy, I can respect that. You wanted to do battle with honor, I very much respect that. And it seems that you have learned training from Jedi, while different…I can respect the want to have knowledge from various sources." 
She turns to look at him, frowning "But you cower now, you threaten and do not even make your threats viable. How are we to fear what you'll say if you will not even say anything." She questioned, rather rhetorically.
"I wanted to give you a warrior's death, I wanted to show you some respect that was deserved, and all I wanted from that was to know where my only living family is." She frowns at him "Do you know what it's like to grow up an orphan? To grow up like we did? to grow up, and never know who your parents were in any form…no names, no places, nothing, and everyone you ask, you plead, you beg with to tell you *something*, just says you'll find out when it's time."
She sighs softly "Annoying." she straitens "and then, imagine if you will, you find out from an unlikely source the truth! and then again you discover that you aren't actually alone in the galaxy! that there is someone out there who knew your parents, who knows the history, who can teach you things, who can do…family stuff with." She waves her hand at that "I don't even know what the hell family does together!" she glances at the two sith "It's what, eat dinner together like we all use to right?" She motions to them, looking at Fel "We don't know, all that stuff with your daughter that you do? yea, we never had it. We don't even know what that stuff could possibly be. It's sad isn't it?"
She sighs and looks back at him, gentle "All I'm asking, is a chance to have something that you have with your daughter. Don't you even care about her? Has it not occured to you that if you don't tell us anything that he-" she points to Alvar "Is going to torture her and get what information we want from her. Is she as strong as you? can she withstand it? Can you, withstand her cries. Oh yes, we could keep you alive, let you watch, let you hear the haunting screams. Really that's what it all comes down to. Do you want her to suffer for your mistakes, or, Will you tell us what we want to know."

Roan Fel listened to Commodore Daiyu as the snake-like creatures slithered in his place to bind his hands against the Vong shaping table.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Roan Fel spends a destiny point to have the persuasion check fail. He takes 10 to Seach his Feelings, granting him a UtF 30 on his check. He also takes 10 to UtF telepathy. Granting him success to send a telepathic communication.

</details>

He began to whisper to Daiyu. **"As I said, I'm not betraying my Empire. I've warned Knight Sinde of your betrayal. They will be ever more cautious now, and you will find securing my daughter to be extremely costly. If even possible."**
Roan Fel looked about despite the binding creatures on his ankles and wrists squeezing him tightly as he moved his head. He was looking to make sure the Vong were not eavesdropping, which they did not seem to be doing. They were preparing what appeared to Yerrik Bugs, and some type of seedlings.
**"I'm sorry about your life as an orphan. It's very tragic. But now understand my case. My daughter who has loved me and known me will now become lost with no family, as you have. Would you wish upon her the same fate? She has something to lose, and my death will be painful and slow. I'm sure Darth Krayt will make an example of me. Now, I must make my point before Krayt returns. Or it may be too late. You're right, I don't know what information Darth Krayt knows. However, on Bastion both of you seemed to confide in me; like that talk we had on the balcony. You all made it very apparent you didn't want to be affiliated with the Sith. We were reluctant to believe in you. But in the end, my insight told me to believe the words that you said. Your cases that you pleaded for an alliance seemed very genuine. I didn't sense any use of the Dark Side for your deceptiveness. I came to believe your words just because how adamant you were to rid the galaxy of the Sith. Yes, Darth Krayt may know all of this information. But why would you tell us that you intend to destroy Korriban? No Sith would have that pop into their head. It would be too unbelievable for us for your case to make an alliance. However, you seemed to be telling the truth. As I saw it, your plans were quite elaborate to destroy Coruscant and Korriban. As a Sith, that makes you unfit to be in charge of such a Superweapon. Now you're telling me Krayt knows this? I somehow doubt he would let you continue to serve at his side if he knew that. Yes, he knows you want him dead. But does Darth Krayt know that you told me that you wanted to destroy the entire Sith Order? Was I really blinded that well by your Dark Side methods, because I couldn't sense it. You convinced us that you wanted Krayt dead for his evil ways and the Sith Order along with it. Should I tell him that? Or did you already tell him beforehand that was part of your rhetoric to get us into your plan? At any rate, I'm sure Darth Krayt would be very interested to hear what appeared to be the truth back at our hearing. And Malificere referred earlier that yes, the Sith kill each other off. However, you seem not particularly versed in the current ways of the Sith. The practice you refer to is the Rule of Two, created by Darth Bane. Darth Krayt's Empire has been proclaimed as the One Sith. Were there is only one true Sith, and the rest are minions to be blindly obedient. The rule of One Sith generally discourages disobedience and treachery. I'm sure that Krayt would want to be bested by Malificere deep down, but the betrayal of Sith Master to Sith Apprentice doesn't happen in this day and age. The fact you didn't know this, further shows me you might genuinely hate the Sith ways..because you don't even know the current order of the Sith. Now, I have no issues giving this information to Lord Krayt. Unless of course, you can *ensure* I survive enough to perform a bold escape."**

Maleficere listened to Fel and for a brief moment, looked as if he was going to attack the man...almost, he nearly did before he calmed himself immediately. this was going to be easy, and possibly quite heartbreaking for the man as he walked over to them with a cold but truthful voice. **"I am certainly more capable than you, Roan Fel. The remark about Korriban was simply indeed…something that popped in my head. Coruscant…well that remark was neither well thought out but then again, someone in my situation would not have had much time to think things through. I simply wanted you to remember and realize the power of the weapon so that it would entice you to, quote, "work with me". It worked more on your knights than you…but in the end, look where it all got you."** He looked to Daiyu before looking back to Fel, now standing in front of him. **I will make you talk Fel, and you -will- tell us where Cade is."**
Thinking again on the hatred and anguish that was passed to him through all of these years, the surge of pure joy when he had exploded Max's ship, when he had found Palpatine's lightsaber and when he had his holocron stolen-....The holocron...HIS holocron that was his fathers, forget who took it the fact is it was stolen! No. His eyes grew with hatred as he looked to Fel now, and he spoke with a sadistic and dark voice as he stared the would-be emperor down. **"I swear to the force and on my father's soul…You -will- end up talking before our time here is done…"**
He then flung his hands out, taking all of his rage and all of his hatred and using it to try and glean what he could from their captive in the form of lightning.

The Offering Chamber erupted into a violent blast of concussive lightning that might make Daiyu feel even surprised. The sound of the lighting was immediately followed by the mortifying screams from Emperor Fel as his body had tremendous energy surging through his body. **"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Noo……..oooooooooooooo! Marasiah!!!!"**
The energy continued to dance from Malificere's fingertips. Daiyu saw the contrast of the Sith attacking the helpless man, and it was a sight to behold. Malificere's eyes were turning orange/yellow, and his skin pale. Nevertheless, the Sith continued to pour the energy down upon the father of Marasiah Fel despite his desperate cries.
As Malificere used the Dark Side, he witnessed a vision. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*Luke Skywalker was laying before him and Malificere was relentlessly brutalizing him with lightning. Luke Skywalker: "FATHER PLEASEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"*

</details>

The images flashed on and off from Palpatine's point of view, back to Malificere's. The LEGACY was continuing. Malificere knew what he was witnessing through his visions, but he channeled the rage into Fel who was hurting unimaginably. Daiyu continued to watch Malificere, as he was a man possessed, his features growing grotesque with rage. His eyes sinister, focused on the suffering of another. Malificere momentarily ceased the attack. Roan Fel was barely conscious, his body now smoldering. He was trying to speak, but couldn't...he might say something after some respite.

Maleficere did indeed cease his attack, panting somewhat but tried to listen as best he could, letting Fel get his breath back...showing the most lenience that he was willing to show. The vision had stirred feelings in him..He enjoyed that immense sense of power...Unlimited power it felt like...That had been Luke Skywalker himself in the vision, he was sure of that much. So now he listened, silent as the grave as he kept his eyes on Fel.

Daiyu jumped back slightly as the light suddenly sprung forth, she watched with an odd sort of horrified fascination as Fels words echoed in her head, Krayt knew she didn't side with the Sith or the Jedi...that she had no claim to them nor they to her so...he knew that didn't he?
No. Don't doubt yourself now, that's what he wants. But watching this...
She looked up, eyes widening as she watched his appearance change so drastically in a short time...how could he enjoy this so much? She looked between them a moment longer even when the lightening had faded.
She moved to look over Fel, checking to make sure he was alright.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-01 00:27:58)

Darth Malificere felt himself becoming overwhelmed with emotion. So much emotion that his knees almost buckled. The Vong looked on but didn't pay much mind to the surroundings, rather kept to their vong forming operations. What they were doing? It was anyone's guess.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*Palpatine: "Goooooooooooood…..my son…….unnnnnnnlimited…..POWER!!!" He saw someone flying out of a Coruscant skyscraper, a dark-skinned Jedi Master. He also saw Luke writhing on the floor begging for help. Momentarily, Fel appeared to be Luke strapped to the Vong contraption.*

</details>

Fel coughed disgustingly. He was trying to raise his head up at Daiyu who was checking on him. Fel muttered only, "Mara……" What was next from the Sith? The Emperor was powerless before him. Out of the three Emperors in the entire known galaxy, this one was about to fell another.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-01 00:39:48)

Maleficere had to steady himself on something to keep from falling due to the emotion, it was that great. that had been his father's voice! He...He was proud. His father, Lord Palpatine, was proud. It was one fo the most, if you could call it this, happy moment's in his life...however twisted it was. After he got his strength back he looked to Fel..or was it Skywalker? The hated cause of his Father's death...He then wondered now...what if he killed and finished off the Skywalkers...? But...Krayt said that he was needed...didn't he? Yes, he did. Why? Why was that bloodline needed...Of course he would not kill off Daiyu, he loved her dearly but this was all becoming rather confusing. He shook his head and cleared his mind before moving to the other side of Fel, looking softly to Daiyu before speaking to Fel once more. **I will only ask this one last time…In -your- own time, tell us where Cade Skywalker is. Do not make me do that again…"** He made no effort to sound concerned, they were past that now. But rather he offered that courtesy, out of love and respect for Daiyu. though he would indeed do what was necessary to get him to talk.

### **zerah** (2013-02-01 00:46:12)

Daiyu started slightly at the name, she knew logically he was calling for his daughter, she knew that but...Mara...that was her name in the dreams...her mother.
She looked up at Alvar as he spoke and nodded slightly, understanding passing through her. He did this for her, letting him have a chance, he knew then how seeing that had effected her.
"Please…take a moment, think this through…"

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-01 00:52:50)

Roan Fel couldn't move his head up, the pain was too much for him. He was borderline unconscious...or worse. He tried to cough up some sort of word.... "Dai….yu…..watch Mara….."
He then nodded his head to shake no to Malificere's demand.

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-01 01:00:38)

Daiyu felt her heart on her throat gently lifting his head for him to look at her, eyes wide as she looked at him. She didn't know what he was asking of her, "what do you mean watch Mara? Watch out for her safety or for her retaliation?"  She was smoothing a hand through his hair, "tell me…please." teller her where Cade was, tell her what he meant, tell her...just let someone for once give answers instead or more questions.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-01 01:07:48)

Maleficere looked to Daiyu with a paleness. If he died on their watch, it would all crumble right on top of his head and bite him in the ass. These moments were very crucial it seemed, so he looked to Daiyu at this moment as of what to do. **"We should probably get a medical droid in here to stabilize him at the least…Krayt wants the honor of killing him, himself."** He then looked to Fel once more. **"If you do not tell me right this second Fel…then you leave me no choice. I will ask Lord Krayt to begin building the Death Star, I will use it to force your Daughter to come to us by aiming it at your home planet, and I will get the information out of her and anyone else that stands in my way. Where. Is. Cade."** There was no wavering, no lying, he was serious about this plan. He took out a com and spoke into it **This is Lord Maleficere. Bring a medical droid to the Chamber of Offering, in Coral City."**

***"I'll never…say…"*** That was about all he could get out as he coughed. The Vong Shapers asked for Malificere to belay the order for a medical droid, they were to render the aid by Krayt's order. Roan Fel was defiant, to the end. It was obvious he was resigned to death. Imperial Knights were trained for this. Death before dishonor. Roan Fel wanted to say more, but he couldn't.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-01 01:27:02)

Maleficere canceled the order promptly, and then told the Shapers to assess whether or not Fel needed any sort of aid, and if so then to give it to him. He then looked to Fel before looking to Daiyu with a shrug. **You understand Dai that…I tried…right? I did what I thought was best. Yes it got out of hand somewhat, but it was beyond my help…I heard my father, I heard his pride and it took over. If you felt the same from yours you would understand…I hope you feel that pride from him one day, if you have not already…"** He was going to add more, but then decided to say it through the force, to her.

Daiyu looked up to him, she wanted to cry. She didn't know if it was exhaustion stepping in again or stress but...why...why wasn't anything easy? Nothing was ever easy, they never got answers they never got anywhere, always more people saying no, refusing to help refusing to answer.
She was so sick of it all.
And they wondered why she betrayed.
Wondered why...how...She could say something and turn around to so something else.
She looked up to the Sith, he had gone far...let it go too long, but...
She looked at Invictus then back to Alvar, they were the only family they had left...them, and Niles...only them left. They never kept things, nothing important.
She sighed and moved silently away from Fel, moving to the door.
"I…I'm done." She says softly "done."
*With everything.*
She left the room then intent to sit in the gardens she loved.

Yuuzaak Kwa'ad made her way to the Vong operation table possessing a small capsule. She placed hovered it over the edge of Fel's foot and then dropped a bit of dark green substance over his foot. Momentarily, a spontaneous reaction occurred and the dark green elastic substance became alive. It completely enveloped Roan Fel up to his head as he screamed in agony. The creature had encapsulated his body now pulsated in the most putrid fashion, it was like a beating heart on Fel's body. The smell was horrible, but the creature was sustaining Roan Fel.
On Daiyu's way out, she heard the screams of Roan Fel.

Maleficere covered his nose for a brief moment before taking it all in and facing the putridness head on. He watched though with a sick satisfaction, knowing that for all the horror that this was...It felt somewhat right to be part of it. Daiyu's leaving though caused him to look to Roan Fel with a resigned sigh **"I leave you Fel…to the mercy or lack thereof, of the Vong and Lord Krayt. May you finally wise up and see the wisdom in giving us the answers we seek. I will step out now, but the Vong will keep you company. I am sure you the news comforts you somewhat. If you decide to tell me what we wish to know, I am sure you will find a way."** He then turned to exit, following Daiyu to at least give her some company. He would return later after the torture of the Vong had time to work. Back when he was weak...he would have said anything to anyone while the torture was going on. He was different now though.

Commodore Daiyu who was now in the Capital Sector was sitting in the Coruscanti gardens where their were a multitude of different colored flowers and roses. The aroma was very pleasant, and a invigorating contrast next to the Vong living conditions. Alas, it was simply the way the Vong were created. But they did not exist in the Force. They were devoid, empty. Not like the life Daiyu felt herself surrounded with. Her comlink began to chirp.
Darth Krayt:**"I have news on your crew from the Vindicator. I will go to you now and continue with Fel."**

### **zerah** (2013-02-01 15:44:29)

Daiyu stared rather blankly from her perch on a bench in the gardens. It was better...it made her feel better to be around so much life and color. She was aware that Alvar had followed her and now sat beside her, silent as she was, likely feeling the strong waves of emotions rolling off of her.
She was too tired to care about holding them back.
She was glad though that he chose to be silent, to sit in companionable silence, it was better...better than the last time she had run off to climb a tree back at the academy...the thought made her smile, remembering when he had followed after her and eventually got her down.
She glanced at him from the corner of her eye.
They had changed so much. She watched him in there and wondered..if there really was a part of her friend still in there, or if he was gone...did he ever actually exist or was this really him? Made one think. What about her? was this really her or...
Her com chirped and she looked down to answer, listening to Krayt before nodding.
"We're in the gardens." She says softly "Fel's being kept stable." she pauses than asks "Are they alright?" concern in her tone. She hoped Torvett had made it back to the crew.

Nevertheless, you can't leave Fel unattended with the Shapers. I'll need meet one or both of you in the Chamber of Offering now."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Outer Sector; Coruscant System</span>
Roughly about 52 hours pass on the early morning of Coruscant. The trio of Darth Malificere, Darth Invictus, and Commodore Daiyu had been assigned to patrol routes along the outer sector perimeter onboard the *Vindicator.* It was remarkable the ship had sustained no damage from the six Imperial Knight capital ships, but no one had a clear story as to why they had escaped. Perhaps that is why the key command crew were with Darth Krayt in Coral City. He was likely questioning them and still Roan Fel. Commander Niles vessel, the *Frontier* was even further out on long range recon. It was standard tactical procedure to have a smaller vessel provide observation to prevent risk to the larger capital ships. The smaller ships could withdraw faster in the event of an emergency to receive covering fire from the *Vindicator.*
Coruscant had stood down from High Alert, yet it remained at Condition Yellow. That meant that 30 percent of Naval forces were on patrol around the Coruscant system and even less ground forces were at readiness. However, the vast and intricate communication arrays' did not allow any incoming transmissions to reduce the chance of sensor scanning from exterior sources. Only outgoing messages could get through the HoloNet. Subspace radio still functioned as normally, but unfortunately took days to get to the receiver and then in turn for the receiver to respond with a message of their own.
Darth Malificere sat at his bridge command chair as he was no doubt very interested in the proceedings with Roan Fel. Commodore Daiyu was likely worried about her command crew. They had grown to respect her more than the Sith, and she knew it. Perhaps the Sith didn't? But why did Darth Krayt assign Malificere to patrol duties? Perhaps because there wasn't a lot of Sith on Coruscant at the moment, and they would need the Force tactically in a Naval situation. There were however; no anomalies to report.
Daiyu checked on Arden and Awne, both seemed to be doing well. Arden was beyond overjoyed to see her and a protocol droid, TC-8 had took orders from Daiyu to feed it Juju fruit. He seemed to like the little berries, even though they were preserved from military rations. Awne remained comatose, serene, and stable in the Medical Facility.
On the bridge, after hearing a report from Ensign Cyneus every hour...it became slightly redundant. Malificere might even be looking at all the Ensigns as if they were Fel with all the rage going through him as of late. Then, he felt a echo in that presence known as the Force.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">1 hour later, at the Chamber of Offering.</span>
Darth Krayt stood tall in the living, dark green chambers in the vile experimental chambers. Fel had the green ooglith bug creature removed from his entire body, and he was in much better shape. Fel's ragged clothing now had many rips across it showing some of his older, but built body. However, his facial features showed that of complete exhaustion. Commodore Daiyu noticed the five key crew members were assisting the Vong shapers, but then stopped to face the trio entering the room. The crew was fine. But the seem very interested to see the three Sith leaders.
**"He's stabilized. We can resume interrogations. But first, I want an explanation as to why you were in an escort formation with Imperial Knight fleet, and did not inform me of them coming so close to our system. Or they could have ordered a strategic bombardment to Coruscant, however unlikely since most of the planet is shielded and they would kill civilians. We could have prepared a counter ambush…or they could have deployed a smaller vessel to our surface with whatever they wanted on board."**
Fel was tired, but he look slightly amused at seeing Darth Krayt question his subordinates.

### **zerah** (2013-02-02 19:49:49)

Daiyu had spent the time of patrol, and apparently forced from her hard won position in control of the bridge, by checking on her crew and on those that were on board. She was glad to find that Awne had been found at some point and spent a number of hours watching over her once again, leaving Arden with her when she continued her rounds on the ship. At times she paced the bridge, ensuring that the Sith didn't forget that she wasn't afraid to stand up to them even if Alvar had told he would make a conscious effort to change and return to himself.
She didn't recall a summons but all too suddenly they were back on Coruscant and back in the foul chamber. When her gaze lifted to look around the room, she couldn't stop the relief flooding her expression and her body language relaxing for a small moment...just a small moment, before her back was straight again and on guard. They were safe. And they were whole. He hadn't hurt them.
Thank the ancestors.
Her gaze turned to Krayt and sighed softly, wondering if it would just be best to tell him out right. Yes...that probably would be best. She glanced to the two Sith, she wasn't going to be the one to say it though, she wasn't going to throw them to the rancor as it were. They should own up to things, own up to the agreement and explain.

Roan Fel looked to the collection of Vong organisms encased throughout the room. They were being kept nourished in a clear liquid, and occasionally the creatures would move. The Shapers were feeding them and stirring capsules gently to get their attention. What were they for?

Maleficere had brought Daiyu and Invictus back to the Camber of Offering, being questioned by Krayt it seemed. It really put them in an awkward situation, he would not deny that. However he remained calm, looking to Invictus to see if their esteemed speaker would want to take point on this or whether he should just explain everything himself. He took a deep breath before saying **"My Lord…It was an error in judgement. I -had- thought of contacting you, but the fact is that they could have been monitoring the frequencies, and any contact to you with the force would have possibly tipped off Fel to a betrayal. I played it close to the vest, and it ended up working in our favor…did it not? In fact all we did…ended up having us come out ahead, if you look at it that way. Do you require more than that? Just say the word and I will break everything down piece by piece so that you can get a better understanding. No one was playing you for the fool, of that I can assure you my Lord. However, know that the plans for the Death Star which you rejected on our first meeting were key in this. Since you expressed no interest, and called them folly and a waste of time, I believed there to be no harm in using it as leverage. A bit presumptuous, but then again…very fruitful for us all, especially you."** He was not being smart-assed...He was being very polite and sincere in tone and what he was saying.

The dark armored gigantic form of a human sneered. He stalked forward in that trademark distinctive motion. The Sith leaned over Malificere, examining him.
**"Why exactly must you tell me that no one was trying to play me for a fool? I simply asked why their ships were brought that close to the system. Your explanation was sufficient. No need to say such a thing, as no one would dare to play me for a fool….right?"**

Both of you realized that Darth Krayt was beginning to grow suspicious. The potential error in Malificere's speechcraft was trying to reassure his Lord that *"no one was playing you for a fool."* That alone made Malificere seem defensive for no reason. Otherwise, would one only assume he had something to hide as there would be no reason to say that. Especially considering Malificere just explained himself and proved himself possibly as one of Krayt's greatest allies. So why would Malificere be so defensive? That was likely what had raised Krayt's suspicion.
**"And why would I need simple reassurance? What's there to be worried about? Is there something you wish to reveal Malificere?"**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 17:27:28)

Maleficere was starting to grow tired of having to walk on eggshells, especially when he was simply offering pure reassurance. But kept his emotions under the utmost control and care. **"My Lord I did not mean to offend you in the slightest, or imply that there -was- anything to worry about. I was simply trying to show you the utmost respect and fealty. As for there being anything I wish to reveal…? There is nothing to reveal My Lord, you already know everything there is to know, the good and the bad."** There was really nothing left to say after that.

Daiyu rubbed her forehead in a way that was starting be a habit. She sighed softly ans put one hand on each of their arms looking at them both sternly "Children…" She says softly but firmly "stop." She gives them both a pointed look and squeezes Alvar's arm looking at him " you made your point, just apologize for sounding defensive, it wasn't how you meant to come across."  She looks to Krayt next and sqieezes his arm, though less effective due to armor, "Take a breathe and accept his apology, he hadn't thought you'd take it as you had. It was a tad paranoid on your part when he's proven his loyalty."
She gives them both a stern look "make up amicably like a good master and minion/ally." She motions to them both then crosses her arms, like some mother ensuring the children stopped fighting...ugh...frightening thought.

Darth Krayt wouldn't hear of the Commodore's words. **"Yes, proven his loyalty by giving me one of my enemies. But he DOES want me dead. You even admit he sounds defensive. As of now, it's my duty to prove he is not the *One Sith*, but that I am. So long as I breathe, I AM the Dark Side. "**
Roan Fel let off a bit of a cough to signal an interruption to the conversation. **"Lord Krayt, perhaps you would be interested in what Malificere told my Knights about you, considering he wants you dead."**
Darth Malificere stopped and looked at the prostrate, fallen Emperor. Roan Fel looked to Daiyu and nodded.

Anything you have to say…I have perfectly logical explanations that cover my actions in getting you where you are RIGHT now. You are delirious with pain, anyone can see that now."**
He now turned to Krayt and raised an eyebrow at the statement of the One Sith. **"With all due respect, my lord, how do you plan to prove that? I am also extremely confused. You JUST now said that I proved my loyalty, then the next sentence you say that I want you dead. If I was loyal, why would I want that? This whole conversation confuses me…"** It was plain on his face that he had no idea how it even got this far, he was just a confused little Sith.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 19:54:30)

**"Well then, I suppose there IS nothing to concern myself with. Perhaps we need only listen to what Fel has to say, now he seems ready to talk."**
He then turned and faced Fel. He clenched his fists. **"No trickery Fel. You better have some intelligence of worth. Now….where is Skywalker? Have you had enough suffering yet? Because this is just the beginning."**
Fel mustered up some energy to speak. **"I won't tell you where Skywalker is, but I might have some intelligence you want. Yes…. I might indeed. Did Darth Malificere tell you his words that lured us here?"** 
**"No, does it matter?"**
Fel felt like smiling for a moment, but refrained. Matters were too bad to consider following through with that. **"He seemed very truthful in his words to destroy you."**
**"Of course Fel, get to the point! That was a blatant trap you fell into."**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 20:04:15)

**"Enough of this." came the reply from Maleficere, glaring at Fel with disgust before looking to Krayt. **"I can speak for myself on what I said that was so enticing. I threw out to them that the Death Star could be used to destroy Korriban. It was a poor gamble, I will admit that but it was done well enough that it got his comrades to be enthralled, and of course he listened to them. I will certainly make up for that, by getting his daughter to come to us before long, but this is what he has been saying to me…Either secure his escape or he mentions this to you, and I took it from him."**
He turned to face Fel with a sneer **"Your bargaining chip just played itself out Fel…Now, regardless of whether I am slain for my attempt at a gambit, I highly doubt that our Lord will let you go, seeing as your information is proven to be useless. At leats I have the satisfaction knowing that in the end, I still had a hand to play in your doom."****

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 20:09:48)

Lord Krayt stood a bit shocked at what he had heard from Malifcere. He almost didn't know how to interpret it. **"Mistake? What mistake do you feel you made Malificere?"**
Lord Krayt gave a quizzical look at Malificere, as if something took him by surprise. Roan Fel waited for the two to continue their exchange. Meanwhile, Captain Torvott had been exchanging glances with Commodore Daiyu quite frequently. That is, if she had taken notice of it.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 20:16:42)

Maleficere looked hesitantly around before saying "**Using Korriban as a gambit…After it had been done, I wondered then if that was the right choice or perhaps if I should have chosen a smaller "target" to get their attention. I was fearful of how you would react my Lord, I did not want to make you displeased."** He had never seen Krayt surprised, or even think such things were possible.

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-05 20:20:09)

Daiyu had noticed, because at this point she was ready to step in ans point them to separate corners and good ancestors she needed sleep.
Still she moved towards the Captain's side shaking her head at the pair, in the back of her sleep deprived mind she had the thought that really those two acted like children, a married couple and father and son...all of that was just frightening.
"Alright Captain?" She asked softly.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 20:23:22)

"Of course you could use that as a gambit. That's just what you told them to go with your plan, correct?" Lord Krayt said as he looked at both Fel and Malificere.
Captain Torvott nodded, and whispered..."There are pressing matters on the ship that need to be addressed when you have the time." The Captain said this but remained focus on Krayt, appearing as professional as ever.

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-05 20:30:13)

Daiyu nodded her head to the Captain's words "how pressing?" She questions softly unwilling to look away from the pair though it seemed things were calming down some.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 20:32:16)

He gestured to be silent as not to interrupt Lord Krayt. But it must be somewhat urgent to mention it now.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 20:47:47)

Maleficere nodded his head. **"Of course my Lord."** He then thought for a moment, looking between Fel, then to Krayt before asking very humbly. **"My Lord…you would agree, that Daiyu, Invictus, and myself have served you well this day would you not? You seem most pleased with our gift to you…I…I would ask a very small favor from our Lord, were you to see fit to grace us with it. If it is not too bold of course."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 21:27:33)

Lord Krayt looked with his blue and yellow eyes through his helmet at Malificere. He then shifted his gaze back to Fel. "And why are you telling me this Fel? It won't save you."
Roan Fel nodded and spoke. "It will benefit me, he seemed very intent on using the Death Star on Coruscant and Korriban. Two targets that no Sith would want to destroy, nor would they use as a plan to capture the likes as me. It would be insane to believe that. He did however, want you dead. He also wanted the total annihilation of the Sith. So we felt though he might not be Sith... He wanted you dead. So we made an agreement. But I'd rather see the Death Star in your hands than his."
Krayt looked to the putrid, vong formed ground. He then looked at Malificere. "The annihilation of Coruscant? Korriban? And the Sith?!"

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-05 21:38:28)

Daiyu sighed and rubbed her head again, stepping forward and promptly covering Fel's mouth with her hand, glaring at the two Sith "Enough, do you not understand that he's saying all of this to get you both at each other's throats? or more so to have you-" she nods at Krayt "to kill him for whatever he deems fit, so in the end he wins even if he dies."
She eyes them both "Mentioning the destruction of Coruscant was foolish but he knows this. It was a suggestion to see reactions. Sith and Korriban? suggestions that aided getting the knights to join him, whether he would have was up in the air as it were because really at that point if things had gone the route they wanted you would be dead, he'd be on the throne and by that point it would be a waiting game to see what he could get while giving little." She looks down to Fel and glares at him "and it astounds me that you and your knights never even thought of that sith or no Sith. I'm an Imperial, not a Sith and I could see that a mile away which just speaks volumes doesn't it."
She let go of Fel's mouth and crosses her arm and stares the pair down "now if you two are done dancing to his music get him to tell us where Cade is." she demanded, back straight and determined.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 21:48:12)

Darth Krayt scoffed at the Commodore. "I'm well aware that's what he could be attempting. That is why I asked him why he was giving me all this information. Cade will prove challenging to remove from him at any rate."
He turned to Malificere. "So yes, why would you suggest such plans as a Sith? It seems very estranged to say such words."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 21:57:16)

Maleficere looked to Krayt for a moment before saying **"Which is exactly why I said it. It was part of the plan all along. To get them to agree to anything I had to say something very outlandish to get them to believe that I did not wish to be of the Sith anymore. You even said it yourself just now that it was acceptable to use Korriban as an enticement. So by stint of that, the extermination of the Sith would be an acceptable gambit as well. Because they accepted it, you also now know that they had the will to exterminate us all. The one about Coruscant…THAT was a mistake. That remains the only thing left now that I regret tossing up to them."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 22:03:18)

"All the same, then I suppose you wouldn't mind handing over the plans to the Death Star?" Krayt said with a partial smile. "I'll have complete control over the project."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 22:05:53)

Maleficere shrugged before nodding **"They are all yours. Though…If I can ask you one thing. The plans are now yours, regardless, I am just curious. Why the sudden change of heart Lord Krayt? When I first presented them to you, you said it was a waste of time."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 22:13:50)

"It is a waste of time. But they would be better kept in my hand. Now, shall we commence the interrogation as Daiyu so dutifully urged us to do?"

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-05 22:23:57)

Daiyu threw her hands in the air muttering a slew of choice curses about men, anatomy envy, challenges and measuring and that life would be easier if she just picked women or nothing at all...all in hutt naturally.
Drawing a deep breath, letting it out slowly she turned to the Captain, jerking her head she moved to a corner of the room and waited for him to start talking.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 22:26:08)

Maleficere nodded in understanding. **"I will make sure they get to you as soon as possible my Lord."** He then decided to leave the bit about favors and rewards alone. All he was going to ask for everyone was a larger SSD with a higher form of firepower, but that would certainly have to wait until he got a hold of Fel's daughter. He felt so much gratitude to Daiyu for what she had said on his behalf, it felt nice to know and remember that he was not alone in any of this.
**"But yes indeed…Our guest is in need of our hospitality my Lord. What would you have us do?"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 22:46:31)

Darth Krayt let a smile of satisfaction cross his face. At long last one of the greatest enemies to his Empire would experience the true power of the Dark Side. "I believe you said you'd like to remove certain limbs from the Emperor, did you not? Start with his leg, cut very high. Fel, you're going to lose all semblance of your humanity and sensitivity with the Force..piece by piece. When I'm done with you your own daughter won't recognize you as human."
The Captain and Daiyu began talking away the busy Vong shapers. "You see Ma'am, when we were at the Coruscant blockade we heard that Moff Tayus' has been trying to reach you and the Sith commanders for some time."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 22:56:38)

Maleficere gave off a grin of satisfaction before igniting his saber and moving to the highest point before the abdomen. **"Let's start off with an easy question then Fel. The security codes for your base of operations. this is how it will work, the sooner you tell me…the quicker I make each cut. Hesitate, and I keep it in place mid-sever."** He then slowly started to cut through the light leg. His eye slit up as the blade closed in to his flesh and when it started to burn away at it, he felt the presence of the Dark Side....his thoughts rested on his father, with their master from their youth...He had come so far since that miserable planet...and he would not stop until he learned as much as possible from the Dark Side of the Force.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 22:59:56)

"I'll never tell you anything. The Force is all I need." Fel said as he stared down Malificere. He then spoke with a hint of compassion in his voice. "I trusted you."

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-05 23:04:19)

Daiyu frowned slightly, brow furrowing "and?" She promoted gently "did you receive message?" She asked trying to understand where he was going with this. She calms her features and smiles "get it all out Captain."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 23:07:40)

"I'm afraid not. Apparently Commander Niles had been trying to inform us to make contact with Moff Tayus. It was urgent priority. She hadn't received a report from you and awaits your transmission."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 23:10:15)

Maleficere simply looked to him, eyes fixated with the Dark Side as he let the blade remain where it sat between flesh. **"Then you were a fool…Old Man. You never really embraced the war or the idea of a unified galaxy. You went along with it as a political necessity. That's not what the Empire—what the galaxy—needs. The galaxy writhes in chaos and disorder. It requires a man of vision, and Lord Krayt is just that. Now tell me what I asked of you just now."**

Daiyu groaned softly ribbing her eyes "lovely…just what we needed."  She sighs and glances to the torture session with a grimace, "are…so you and the others intend to watch or help with this?" She questions, motioning to the scene.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 23:27:07)

Roan Fel looked at Malificere. Fear was beginning to cloud his judgment as he looked into the pale features of Darth Malificere. Never did Fel picture he would be defeated. He was the best the Knights had to offer, and now he was going to endure hell. He knew he was likely to be vong shaped, losing all shape of his humanity. "Force forgive me, The security codes for Bastion are... IMP-K01334."
Darth Krayt laughed. "I suppose these last two days have you on the brink of insanity. You don't appear to be lying. Don't worry, you've saved yourself some pain. Only your headquarters and surrounding cities shall be bombarded to oblivion."
Captain Torvott looked at Daiyu. "We are here to record the proceedings. If those codes are correct, Ravelin City will be annihilated."

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-05 23:38:56)

Daiyu nodded head and sighed "better you than me." she says with a chuckle, "thank you for the information." She a to the two Sith, so pleased in their work.
Not wanting to watch this, she moves to Krayt' s side and quietly asks "I wonder, if you will permit me to leave you boys to your fun while I attend to a Moff call?"

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-05 23:44:20)

Maleficere gave a short laugh before cutting clean through, true to his word. **"You see…? I can be honest…Clean through, just like I said. Let's up the ante now."** He placed the blade atop the next leg, away from the skin. **"Because you did so well, I will give you a sporting chance for this one. I will give you a chance to tell me before I even start cutting this leg…A chance for one clean swipe…Now,"** he steadied his grip, ready to start torturing the other leg if he hesitated or lied. **"Where are your ship yards…."** He then looked to Daiyu **"I would prefer to be there for that as well, Daiyu…Could we not persuade you to stay until we are finished? The moff's have waited this long…what is a few more minutes?"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-05 23:52:30)

Darth Krayt looked quizzically at Daiyu's request. **I do not enjoy this like you think that I do. Unfortunately I do take some satisfaction at seeing my enemy suffer. As it pales to what I've been through. But most importantly this is to get the information we need. But yes, you may contact the Moffs. There is no doubt you have important duties to attend to. Now even more so that we have the security countermeasures to Bastion."** The Sith did not flinch in his speech as Fel writhed in pain as the distinctive hiss-crack of Malificere's lightsaber removed the Emperor's leg clean off. Fel cried out in pain. **"Kill me, I have betrayed my people. I have no honor left. The shipyards will fall soon enough after Bastion is dealt with."**
On the way out of the Vong bio-formed door, Krayt stopped Commodore Daiyu. The man's tone became lighter. **"I have a question before you go. Do you believe Darth Malificere is a good Sith?"**

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 08:34:14)

Daiyu sighed faintly, watching Fel; watching this grated on her morals, she wanted the information on Cade but...surely there had to be a better way...She didn't voice this though, no, only turned towards the door "I know you want to be there but one of us has to do this and the other needs to take care of things with the ships; you're busy and far better at this. I'll play nice, fear not." she went for lighthearted but felt she may have missed the mark a bit.
She paused again, turning to look back and up to Krayt, the question making her pause and consider. "Is it not an oximoran? a good Sith." Her lips twitched up in a tiny tired smile before it faded, watching the other "I don't know enough Sith to really compare him properly…or enough about the Sith, but…" She hums and looks back to the taller man "He will be." She says finally "He still has to find himself…and the confidence within it." she frowns and looks down to Fel sadly "Don't we all…" She shakes herself and sighs, she'd been doing that a lot lately, "But yes, I think him to be a…good Sith, and will be better as he grows within the force."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-06 11:15:20)

Those words from Daiyu made him feel..happy. To him it would mean that he was not as lost as he had originally thought. Granted he didnt view himself as a total loss, just that perhaps he was wondering still where he fit in currently. He was a Sith, he knew this..but beyond that...where did that fit? He looked to Fel and shook his head. **"Wrong answer…I will ask again. Where. Are. Your. Shipyards."** A fleet of their own ships would work well with the bombarding of Bastion...Poetic justice. He hoped that Krayt would be able to sense his line of thought, granted the decimation would commence either way...It felt right to use their own ships. He then started to slowly cut through the other leg, taking his time to feel the thrill of felling an avowed enemy of the Sith.
Before she had left fully he would have said to Daiyu **"At least then give them my regards?"** He would have to have her give him a tour of the gardens when they had time. It looked very relaxing, something he had not had in a while.

**"You mean, as he grows stronger in the Dark Side…correct?"** Darth Krayt said as he watched for Daiyu's reaction. He gestured so should she could move on to make contact with Moff Tayus. Commodore Daiyu was aware that Coruscant was at Condition Yellow and HoloNet communications were blocked, however she knew Lord Krayt's HoloNet transceiver would work fine. She would go to the Jedi Temple.
At the same time, Malificere's lightsaber slowly sizzled through the flesh, sinew, and bone of Fel as he screamed in agony. It was an inventive way of torture with a lightsaber, cutting as slow as if passing the blade through durasteel. This was living flesh, slowly and methodically being vaporized by the lethal blade. **"You….have heard enough! I'm….lost….Bastion will be….lost!"**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Jedi Temple</span>
Commodore Daiyu had taken a short airspeeder trip back to the Jedi Temple and now was walking through the silent and shadowy picturesque view of the Jedi Temple. There weren't many personnel here, except for elite stormtroopers and the occasional Sith who looked beyond normal conversation. The fine red carpet felt soft and firm underneath her feet, unlike the grotesque living conditions of the Vong city. She passed by the shelves of Holo units that were luminescent blue and quite aesthetically pleasing. Daiyu then proceeded to take a short turbolift ride to the Meditative Chambers. This room had a few cushioned seats that had been used by the Jedi in the past to gather and meditate in tandem. She noticed the HoloNet Transceiver unit in the back room and proceeded to activate it by standing a top it. A small HoloNet dish was in front her which projected an image. It was searching for connection. Suddenly, the middle-aged woman Moff Tayus appeared on screen, dressed in her Imperial Naval Gray uniform and rank insignia.
**"Commodore? At last, I hear something from you. How are you faring?"**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-06 17:13:52)

He continued to move it down slowly, before pulling the saber out and starting just slightly higher than the previous mark, starting a new cut on the same appendage. **"Right…we can certainly change the topic if you wish. You -could- give us the location of Cade Skywalker, or tell me when your daughter is most vulnerable to an abduction. Chances are she knows where he is as well. Personally though if I were you, I'd give us the first option to save your daughter the trouble. If we have to we will scour the entire galaxy for him, not resting until he comes to us by will or by force, planets will fall and innocents will die in far greater numbers. The choice is yours, and I will even allow you to choose this time which one you give me, think hard Fel…At least die with dignity by helping the true Emperor."**

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 17:24:38)

Daiyu didn't answer him as she left, dark side or not was his choice and no one else's. So she made her way to a dock and caught a ride back to the temple, the silent ride and the silent walk through the corridors was welcome to her stressed and tired mind.
Why hadn't she thought to try and sleep while they were on the ship? Stupid. Oh well, she'd try to get some sleep at some point. Sighing she exited the turboprop she moves to the hill she'd use and stepped on the pad waiting, standing straight but arms crossed.
She offered a nodding of head to the more in greeting "as well as I can be at the moment, Darth Malificere sends his regards and regrets being unable to be here but there were other matters he needed to attend to." She says "I was told you had been attempting contact, my apologies."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 17:35:18)

The woman let off a bit of a frown. "You look weary. I suppose it wouldn't be too much to ask for a situation report? After all, losing Moff Alexander of the Raiballo sector hurt us. It's never good when we have a change of governance in a sector. Moffs tend to be radical in their political procedures, so you can imagine the chaos with a replacement."
She took a sip from a mug, which was likely caff or a fine tea of some kind. "I understand he took previous interest in the two Star Forges and arranged a meeting near the Ziost system. His ship ejected a compartment which he resided in and he was found dead on the surface of Ziost. Last I heard the Imperial Knights were suspect. How were they involved? You met the Knights, did you not?"

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 17:52:47)

Daiyu sighed faintly rubbing her eyes "I suppose I am a bit tired," she agrees "and yes, we did meet with the knights…"  She frowns and looks off to the side in thought. "Forgive me if I don't tell you everything at the moment, things are still ongoing and I would rather give a full report when I have it."  She offered a tired smirk in apology.
"However, we are all safe and currently on Coruscant, I hope that will be sufficient for now?"

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 17:57:38)

"I'm afraid that won't be sufficient Commodore. As you know, I'm your only link to what remains of Master Ristrin's vision. You need to stay in contact with me. I feel you might be keeping something from me. Am I incorrect?"

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 18:09:29)

A faint nod of her head and a smirk "yes. I am." She admits freely, and that was it. Alvar usually handled the Moffs, he dealt with what to tell and what not, she could say...but...well she was the troublemaker. "I can tell you things happened, plans where made and failed, a person captured and being interrogated by our favorite Sith Admiral and Emperor, and he wants the plans for the death star…for safe keeping."  She grinned, short of a formal order she was going to make this he'll to get information.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 18:25:00)

Moff Tayus had a look of desperation quickly go over her face. "The plans? But that is integral to Master Ristrin's legacy. It cannot be compromised. Do you understand that Commodore?"

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 18:31:11)

Daiyu raised a brow "the knowledge of the plans came up again, yes, again. Lord Krayt wasn't interested before but now believes they would be safer with him instead of possibly against the Empire. I don't mind, there are things at work that master could never have predicted and if he had the should have shared." She glares at the thought, bit calms herself "master is gone now, and he is proud of us..he told me that, he would trust is I would hope."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 18:33:04)

Meanwhile, in the Chamber of Offering...Malificere graced Roan Fel with a moment of respite to answer his question. "I've told you enough. Mutilate me as you see fit, but my Knights will...rally to these losses."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 18:35:17)

Moff Tayus straightened out her Naval blouse and promptly replied. "You...talked to him? Uhm...nevermind. But how could our Lord Krayt possess the plans? He doesn't know where they are."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-06 18:38:16)

Maleficere rolled his eyes before severing the leg all the way, then looked to Krayt with a annoyed sigh. **"My lord it seems as though what we have gotten is all there will be from him…Shall I continue? Or would you like to try your hand?"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 18:50:19)

Moff Tayus replied in a condescending manner. "Watch your tone Commodore. You said he felt they'd be safer with him. Therefore that means he wants them...correct? At any rate the Star Forge research has turned up some information. The Star Forge has moved out of the Manaan system and continues to move deeper into Wild Space. It remains otherwise dormant and we starting to decipher some of its language. It seems to be fixated on a singular word that translates from Sith origin..the word is Electus. Or Chosen One. The Star Forge you first encountered at the Unknown Regions remains at a low power state."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 19:01:41)

Back in the Chamber of Offering, Darth Krayt oddly did not want to directly intervene. "No, you're doing well. Somehow you got the Bastion coordinates out of him."
Krayt then moved forward to a collection of Vong formed appendages. "You see this, Fel? These are mastercrafts from the Vong species. They are unique organisms which infuse themselves on a humanoid host. They are in the Yerrik family of insectasoids. My minion can attest to their symbiotic nature they form with a host. Earlier Commodore Daiyu mentioned severing you the Force. But after we transform you to a Vong construct, the Force will be but a quiet whisper to you. Meditate on that as my minion demolishes you with his bare hands. Now give us Cade's location while you have some diginity of a Knight and a human being."
Roan Fel looked mortified at the slithering creatures that were to become one with him. A fate worse than death? Worse than torture he was already to endure and more to come? "The Force...shall steady my resolve...to whatever end I may face."
Darth Krayt then signaled to commence the arduous bludgeoning of Fel's body and head.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-06 21:11:04)

Maleficere felt a small surge of pride at Krayt's words. A moment ago he was questioning his loyalty...understandable for his poorly chosen words, but now he had been told that he was doing a good job. Perhaps...Perhaps all those times he had been angry, Maleficere had been angry at himself...? Krayt seemed like a very agreeable figure in this time, and while tension had been between them he felt it slowly melt away. It had been that tension that had made Maleficere strive to please Krayt, to prove his worth. It was at that moment that realization came to him, as he saw Fel's head being brutally mauled and beaten...This was a society in which he belonged. He relished it, loved it...Even though he had hated the pain it caused him to go through, it gave him such elation to watch a hated enemy go through the same.
**"Tch…Fool. Why do you deny the inevitable? Why do you prolong what will already happen?"** and Idea struck him as he turned to Krayt. He thought his idea over a few times before deciding that it was unproductive and foolish, and therefore scrapped it. Deactivating the saber he readies his fists, and delivers a sharp blow to Fel's rib cage, followed by another straight to his face...falling back on that Shock Boxing tournament with Daiyu.

Daiyu glared faintly but made no attempt to put the Moff down, she wasn't empress or in a higher state of authority...yet.
She frowns though at he word and hums faintly, that was interesting, the forges spoken the Sith language "maybe it has a location in mind it needs to head towards" after all they had no idea how it was programmed, bit now she really wanted to get back on board and see what it might tell her.
"anything else of note ma'am?"

Malificere delivered a powerful left hook to the rib cage of the helplessly bound Fel. He flinched and yelled out in agony as the sound of as a snap was heard. The legless man looked as if he had been dissected for some science experiment as he was strapped to the Vong operation table. Then Fel sent out a telepathic "help" to Daiyu as he was gasping for air. As Malificere saw this he delivered a devastating right hand to the temple of Fel that sent him unconscious. Blood came trickling out of Fel's mouth as Krayt had to restrain the brutal pugilist. It was much different when the person couldn't move. Unlike shockboxing..there were also no energy gloves.
Krayt motioned for Yuuzaak Kwaad. "Check his condition, he seems unstable." The shaper then moved to position and used a small starfish-shaped coral object, small tentacles began slithering into his mouth. 'Waad simply responded, "His life force is diminishing, we'll have an ooglith immerse him once again. If the Gods favor him it should restore his life."
Before Malificere laid a legless and facially mutilated man who called himself Emperor. And now he had been reduced to a gruesome near nothingness. Darth Krayt nodded to Malificere. "Don't concern yourself if he dies. That's what he wanted."

Moff Tayus shook her head yes. "Do you know something about the Star Forge we don't that may be of use? It seems to respond in a unique manner to you. Oh and I suppose you should also know that Moff Tunkin has assumed control of the Raiballo sector. Tunkin has proved to be very capable and knows of you. Moff Alexander was a trusted ally of yours, and I have to note his perfomance was..lacking. He also sought to accomplish the most daunting of governmental tasks with only droids as his aids. He devoted his time to seeking the Jedi and testing out a prototype ecological device from the Vong. He always denied our requests for audience. Quite the strange man that you knew. If you would check up on his files perhaps you could offer advice to Moff Tunkin when you have the time."
(((That means you can check the sector thread to view his progress as a Moff and then message Moff Tunkin with 1/2 your character level of skill checks for political advisement. It will net you xp and change the political landscape of Raiballo.)))

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 22:21:01)

Daiyu nodded her head "I'll look into the files after this call is over and see what I might offer. As for the forges what you know is more than I, though I would like to make contact again with the wild space one." She trails off with a frown looking to the side before clicking her tongue in annoyance.
Damn fool of a man was calling for help again she breathed and sent out her reply *Cade*

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-06 22:26:49)

Maleficere looked to Krayt with a smirk, not a trace of emotion other than amusement. **"Of course my Lord. I was not concerning myself with that anyways. All I care about right now, is to get the information needed. In the end he proved to be incapable of even saving himself. What kind of person like that could ever call them-self Emperor? Power is for the strong…and in the end he proved weak. As I have observed, 'There is only power and those too weak to seek it."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 23:06:05)

Commodore Daiyu sensed that her message through the Force was did not reach Fel's presence. He felt, absent in the Force. Was he unconscious? Dead?
Moff Tayus saw that she was troubled. "Something the matter? Anyways, see what you can find out about the Knights and Moff Alexander if at all possible."
------------------------------------------
Darth Krayt looked to the shapers. "Do you need to begin Vong forming now? I'd rather wait." Yuuzaak Kwaad responded no. Krayt then looked to Malificere. "You've done well my minion. The strike on Bastion will commence immediately. Darth Miladi's fleet should be closest to that sector. We will destroy their headquarters and nearby structures. This should send another powerful message to the Galaxy. The Sith Empire is in total control. There will continue to be events like Mon Calamari and Bastion should any resistance continue. The holocron is right, you must be the heir of Palpatine."

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 23:14:58)

Daiyu shook her head "No, nothing wrong, just something that might need my attention. I'll get right on it and be in contact with him when I have something." she offers a nos of her head "if that's all, I will see to what I need to."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-06 23:20:54)

Maleficere looked up to Krayt at his admission that Maleficere was the Heir of Palpatine. How long had it been since someone else had said that to him? It felt good to have that again, but this also brought up one thing that needed to be addressed. His holocron. "My lord your words bring me strength and power, yet you bring up something that is important to me. Something I will not ask you to return, rather to let me borrow? The holocron that I had arrived with? I would very much wish to speak with my father again someday, if you ever find it appropriate. What I want more than anything right now, however, is a ship...Stronger than the Vindicator. That was only given to me for my performance at the Oturis academy, I want something that strikes fear into the hearts of our enemies. I -want- to be feared and respected...I want a ship worthy of me as a Sith Lord. Is there anything that I can do, to gain such a vessel? The vindicator is not even suitable for a Moff, if I may speak freely." It was a bold request, but he hoped Krayt would understand that his requests only stemmed from the want of more power...not as one who took advantage of praise. He could only hope that Krayt would understand this...and was prepared to be rebuked.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 23:23:26)

"Remember, keep me updated. We need to stay in contact and have this project under our close scrutiny. I wish you well. Moff Tayus out."
The project? Did she mean WA-3? Or was it Ristrin's legacy? And how would Moff Tunkin fare in Alexander's dilapidated sector? She wasn't a Moff, but she'd been given the honor to advise one. This would certainly get her noticed in the political scheme of matters. Furthermore, did the Knights really have anything to do with Alexander's death? They seemed honest enough. So who could have it been?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-06 23:30:12)

Darth Krayt didn't even hesitate to respond. "You will continue to serve as Commander of the Vindicator. My reasons are my own. Though you have proven capable, you have more to learn on commanding a vessel. The crew does respect Commodore Daiyu do they not? Even more so than you? Nevertheless, if you seek meditation now I release you to your own free will. Fel will need some recovery time before we are to continue."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-06 23:36:47)

Maleficere bowed. "Yes my Lord, as for the crew respecting...I would say it is evenly balanced. But as you wish, I will stay aboard the Vindicator until you feel it necessary to change that." He then turned around on his heels and walked briskly out of the room, somewhat jaded by the decline to let him have a different vessel, as well as the fact he skirted over the holocron...but could live with it. He decided to make his way to the Vindicator, intent on going to the cargo hold to meditate....unless he got stopped or sidetracked. Then again...perhaps he would contact the moff himself.

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-06 23:57:24)

Daiyu waited for the the image to fade before stepping off the pad and making her way out of the room, rubbing her eyes she made her way back through the halls, nearly stumbling into Alvar on passing. She offers him a smile and sighs "well I have work to do back on the ship, you heading back as well?" she asks walking beside him back o catch a shuttle to the ship.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-07 00:14:37)

Maleficere gave a friendly nod with a playful nudge to her. **"Indeed. I figured some long needed meditation would be good, unless you need my help with anything? Not that I expect you to need it, but the offer is there."** He reddened slightly before he decided to change the subject. **"I asked Krayt if we could all change to a larger and stronger ship, that was denied. When I asked if I could borrow my holocron he seemed to skirt over that…then again I should not be surprised. That holocron must have many secrets, things that father would only want me to know. I just…really wish I could hold it again…"** He looked down for a moment sadly before giving a playful smile **"You are welcome to meditate with me if you wish Dai…The company would be appreciated if you decided to."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-07 07:55:06)

Daiyu chuckled faintly at the nudge, smiling at him as they walked to their shuttle.  "It's a nice proposition, but I think I might pass this time." she said, an apology in her tone as she boarded the shuttle and took a seat, waiting for him to sit before giving the order to head back to the ship.
"I've been asked to offer advice to the new Moff taking over Kane's territories, there's a lot of files I'll need to go through and…" she sighs and leans her head back "I should really make a better effort of getting some sleep…apparently it's starting to show."

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-07 14:46:47)

The Coruscanti streets were bustling and...peaceful. The people were mostly humanoid unlike the Undercity. The occasional stormtrooper pair could be seen, patrolling the streets with weapons in the carry posture. It could possibly remind the two that the Empire was corrupt and evil. But their methods did bring peace and order when not faced with resistance. The war to the Coruscant people represented maybe some business opportunities or investments at best. But they had no reason to worry themselves. Would all of the Sith Empire's planets be like this if they won the war?
Once in a pleasant docking bay, the two climbed into a Nune shuttle were the flight lieutenant took them into the atmosphere.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-07 18:52:45)

Maleficere boarded the shuttle with Daiyu and at the mention of all of the work she had he turned to her and asked honestly. **"Meditating can wait…would you like any help with what you need to get done? Two heads are better than one, and I could give you honest feedback as well as just be someone that can listen to any ideas you have…You do look like you could use the rest, no offense, and taking this on all on your own is in your abilities…but will only drain you that much more…"** He offered her a smile and placed his hand in hers gently, giving a soft squeeze. **"It would honor me if you let me listen to your ideas…you do come up with very good and creative ones. The Empire is lucky to have you."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-07 19:09:57)

Daiyu smiled and squeezed his hand in return, shifting to lay her head on his shoulder with a sigh "You're sucking up." she says, fondness and humor in her tone "I don't know what you want but you know sucking up only works with things I like." she giggles faintly and gets comfortable for the trip "I wouldn't mind the help, I don't know how many files there are to go through but it would be nice to have someone else reading them with me."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-07 19:15:10)

Maleficere stuck out his tongue playfull before helping her get comfortable. **"It is not sucking up if it is the truth…and I am more than happy to help you whenever you need it. Maybe with the two of us getting work done, then the -both- of us will have time to rest or meditate or whatever. But at least we can rest during the shuttle trip."** he said while putting an arm gently around her shoulders. **"Just tell me what you want me to do Dai, and I will start there."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-07 21:01:45)

Daiyu hums faintly, scooting to get comfortable and shift is arm to a more comfortable place with a sigh. "Mmm…rest for a short time…than files." she mumbles "We can take them to the suite by datapads…give us somewhere comfortable to read and lets Arden actually see us again." She chuckles "Poor little guy, I feel like I've been neglecting him." she trails off and takes a deep breath, humming softly.
Short nap...that'll help...just a short little nap.

The Nune class shuttle landed in the expansive main hangar bay off the port side of the *Vindicator.* The assortment of TIE fighters were off their hanging storage racks and were at "Alert" storage phase so they could easily take off. Though the crew seemed to be doing some lazy maintenance of the TIE fighters by Imperial standards either Daiyu or Malificere would notice if that concerned them. There were hydrospanners, fusion cutters, and a various assortment of tools sitting outside of it's plasteel tool box in a pile near a TIE. The crew would pass through the hangar bay as they received a barrage of salutes. Many of the deck crew seemed to steer clear of Malificere's presence.
After the the main turbolift ride from traveling down the main port passageway, you arrive at the bridge. A younger imperial who was overlooking the sensor service pit saw the two import figures grace the spacious bridge and shouted. **"ATTENTION!"** Any crew member who was not doing a mission essential operation on the bridge snapped to a rigid stance. After they were told at ease, the young Imperial who was Lieutenant Trysiri reported in. **"It is honor to have you both back on board. Sector 7 of the Coruscant system remains all clear of any anomalies or points of interest. We've heard rumors that there is a major operation in the initial phases by Darth Krayt. How may I be of service?"**

### **zerah** (2013-02-08 12:39:07)

Daiyu jolts slightly at the sudden feeling of a change in air preasure, breathing deep she lifts her head from her comfortable and sighs, blinking a few times and rubbing her eyes. She takes a few minutes to stretch before exiting the shuttle, at least she felt a small bit better, a little more energy...that was something.
She takes a moment to look around the hanger, waiting for the Sith with her to hurry out and hums faintly at the state of...well she could only call it laziness of the maintenance crew on the TIE's. She should call them on it, get them to get back on task with the usual hustle but...well they were patrolling for nothing. The likelihood of being attacked was slim, she could just let them go about, she knew she was certainly tired enough to be lazy, then again they could be working on some delicate section that required a...slowness.
She shook her head, she was too tired to reprimand them.
Once Alvar joined her they made their way, she hanging back a moment to shift a piece of equipment with her foot with enough noise to gain the crews attention. She raised a brow and made a point of looking over the mess then back at them before saying "Really?" They knew better than to keep messes.  "If you aren't using it right this moment or about to in the next two seconds put it away, we are not some backwater repair shop; have some pride in your space." She says simply. It was true. They knew better. She didn't wait around, simply continued on. It wasn't a reprimand, she sounded more amused and slightly disappointed in the habit than anything else.
She nearly fell asleep in the turbolift but shook herself awake just before they reached their floor, moving onto the bridge she sighed and smiled; ancestors it felt good to be back on the bridge. The call to attention was met with a nod a just as quick 'at ease' before looking to the Lieutenant for the report nodding at the end and hummed faintly "I need the report from Raiballo Sector." she said "And by chance has medical made any report on a change in Awne's condition?"

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-08 16:02:04)

Lieutenant Tysiri with his hazel eyes looked to the sensor control panel pit. There were several naval personnel dressed in working black uniforms. That uniformed designated they were not command crew, but controlled mission essential equipment on the bridge. He asked to bring up the most current information on the Raiballo Sector from the Moff Council. **"The information should be available. We can forward it to your quarters, or you can access it on the bridge. Or any location of your designation. And about Awne? I'm assuming you're referring to the high priority personnel in med bay? The Farghul? Her condition remains stable yet comatose. Her vitals seem to be at condition of extreme rest, 20 beats per minute. Almost dangerous levels but that might be normal for a extremely well-conditioned human or a Farghul. Will there be anything else Ma'am?"**
As she heard the words from the young Lieutenant, that familiar echo in the Force came to her head. As if someone was whispering right into her ear.

### **zerah** (2013-02-08 22:29:09)

Daiyu nodded her head, faintly rubbing her eyes even as she heard the echo. She turned her head to the side, as though listening to something near by but then sighed "Forward it to the Admiral's suite." she ordered simply; she patted Alvar on the shoulder gently "I'm going to check on her first." she told him nodding to the Lieutenant "Keep me informed of any changes up here." she called as she left the bridge, taking the turbolift to the med bay to check over Awne first; taking a few moments to see for herself her condition and hear the same report from the doctor overseeing her.
Once assured she was alright, and unchanged she headed for the suite, picking up Arden on the way, letting him sit on her shoulder while she pet his chest gently. Once in the suite she kicked off her shoes, changed pants and into a new comfortable shirt before setting to work on the files.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-08 22:48:37)

At the blatant lack of respect for Daiyu's words on the subject of workspace cleanliness...as well as the even more evidint disregard for workmanship, he simply nodded to Daiyu as she left and patted her shoulder. [Invalid dice roll_id: [color=#004000]&quot;I will be there to help you soon. Say hello to Arden for me?&quot;[/color]]
Once she was gone he turned to the lacking crew and cracked his knuckles outwards with his hands before saying with a sneer. [Invalid dice roll_id: [color=#004000]&quot;Do any of you think it is appropriate to not acknowledge a superior officer when they give a command&#8230;? Especially about such sloppy and lazy work&#8230;?

Is. That. Clear? I do not care what you do in your time off, but when you are WORKING&#8230;you had better take pride in it like your life depended on it, because it does.&quot;[/color]] He glared at them, waiting for someone to either make him more cross or to see whether they got what he was saying.

Lieutenant Tysiri acknowledged the Commodore's orders. He promptly transmitted the information to the lavish suite. Commodore Daiyu then proceeded to Awne's position. She seemed to be breathing normally and remained just as you had first seen her retrieved from the carbonite. After the trip to the med bay, she skimmed over the records from Moff Tunkin. Once again, another echo came into her mind as a holoprojection of the Raiballo sector came up.

The deck officer immediately assembled his men to respond to the Sith. He saluted out of pure fear. **"It won't happen again lord Malificere!!"**
After that, the Sith came to realize the absolute terror he commanded. However, he noticed they didn't respond to him quite like they did for the Commodore. It was true, they respected the Sith out of fear. But it was no doubt they remembered the argument amongst the Sith on the bridge it which the Commodore made them seem possibly incapable. He ruled out of fear. The Commodore led by the Imperial Viewpoint with her twist of compassion.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-09 08:52:31)

Maleficere gave a nod before turning on his heels and went to catch up with Daiyu inside his room. He noticed that the crew did not have teh same respect...He would have to be a fool not to. It made him somewhat jealous that she had ousted him just because of that one argument on the bridge, but that moment was behind him and he knew he would prove himself as well as have a chance to show his quality. He had, after all, gotten the security codes out of Fel with ease...such news would certainly render their doubts of capabilities mute. The only reason he had NOT said anything yet or made any sort of announcement...was that there could very well be a traitor amongst the crew. He opened his com at this point and said to perhaps his closest friend other than Daiyu.
**"Lord Invictus…I know that you possess the ability of foreseeing events..Use it, find out if we have any traitors on the Vindicator by seeing what will happen as far as the outcome of the attack on Bastion. I want to make sure that this goes in our favor every step of the way."**

### **zerah** (2013-02-09 14:34:25)

Slowly Daiyu read through the reports and overviews of the systems Kane had been looking after, rubbing her eyes as she made notes here and there:
Alurion system had little crime at the time but could rebound, culture was at a minimum but foraging and survival cultures could become more valuable for training centers for recon soldiers; the trouble there seemed to be at most the economy...they should first look into if it's worth while to cultivated the notion of training areas within the culture, if it's worthwhile than perhaps they might be able to set up trade and ensure the economy begins to turn.
Daiyu hummed faintly and added a note to have the system looked over for jedi presence, it might be a place for Cade to hide if the system is in a cease fire.
Dantooine was going to prove challenging if the rumors listed proved accurate, the farmland and agriculture would be perfect for ensure continued resources for the Empire but only if they can keep it...Krayt and imperials in general have a low presence, that should be remedied slowly and as a show of being worthwhile to house them...perhaps new farms? perhaps new species of plants...that might make a good peace offering and show that the empire cares for what they want...
Daiyu made a few more notes of checking for Jedi and a side note to speak to more scientific minds on what they might be able to use to see this possibly cloaked ship.
She leaned back in her seat and sighed, rubbing her eyes; and where the hell was that echo coming from!?
deep breath Dai….
She took a slow deep breath and moved, shifting the pillows on the bed in to a weird nest like thing, taking a seat in the middle she focused on the voice Who are you?

Darth Invictus nodded his head and informed Malificere that he would need some meditation time. Darth Malificere then entered into the Admiral's suite which was decorated with various war trophies in a highlighted, pristine plasteel casing on the wall. There was a soft ballad playing in the background. A war like tune with a calming twist. You'd suppose it would help you stay calm and think. Daiyu appeared to be using the Force by Malificere's senses as he stepped in the room.

*After about two days pass, you awake early at 0600 to hear that the Battle at Bastion had concluded. Darth Krayt forwarded the surveillance footage from Probe Droids to the Battle on the ground.*
Commodore Daiyu when across her scatted notes on the Raiballo Sector and activated the Imperial Probe Droids surveillance imagery on the HoloNet system. A blue luminescent projection was seen in a large fashion that showed the skirmish. You saw Ravelin City, that was the primary target as designated by Darth Krayt. The droid who were recording the imagery seemed to be high flying above the skyscrapes from roof to roof of Ravelin City. You saw the turbolaser towers firing viciously into orbit, most likely to repel Darth Miladi's fleet. And then you saw it. There was a raging torrent of turbolaser fire splashing into various buildings of Ravelin City. To your viewing eyes, you saw buildings collapse to total rubble right before your eyes. You saw the occasional group of people running en masse only to be struck by a deadly turbolaser bolt which instantly vaporized them into nothing. There were some survivors who were crawling on the ground, either wounded or dying. There were children dead in the streets of Ravelin City. Some of the bodies only had skeletal remains.
The probe droids then turned to what looked like to be the remains of Oturis Academy, it had the top half of the building destroyed. The place where you had grown, was now gone. Finally, you saw the probe droids arrive at their destination. The Imperial Knight Headquarters...it had been ground zero. The only reason you knew it was the Headquarters is because you knew the location yourself. It had been reduced to a smoldering crater. Anyone who had been in there was most certainly dead. Did Marasiah reside in there? Knights Sinde or Knight Ibsen? Who knew? The transmission cut. The battle had obviously been an Imperial victory. All because of Malificere's gathered intelligence. They had no planetary shields to deflect the orbital bombardment. A TC unit brought you your morning caf as yet another day in Imperial office had just begun, and you had witnessed such destruction. Women, children, Imperial Knights...all dead. The ones who weren't dead were horrendously mutilated, crawling or limping for precious life. There wasn't even any ground troops, just arbitrary extermination. Daiyu had witnessed this, and knew they both had busy lives to attend to. This was their life.

Daiyu had frowned at that, but let the link clear, bringing herself back to the world around her at the sound of the door. She offered a smile to Alvar and motioned him to her notes for him to look over at his leisure while she climbed under the covers and promptly fell asleep.
Two days, two days of reading reports, and having such blissfully needed sleep she felt better than she had been feeling in days. Which..really was great considering that she was staring in open mouthed horror at the footage playing across her vision.
Eyes wide and unable to even attempt to move to brush away stray tears or even blink them away, he...how...she couldn't....
Her brain didn't even want to register words even after it had finished and the screen was dark again. Even when caf was sat beside her she couldn't move. All that played in her head was the images of the dead innocents, the image of the academy burnt down, the images of the knights headquarters gone...
How....how could he do such a thing...there were innocent people on that planet! that academy had trained imperials! it had trained them! why...why hadn't they just targeted the places that had been firing? sent a ground team to take out hostiles at the knights base? why....why so much death? it...it was all so unnecessary didn't he see that?
She finally managed to get her hand to move shakily wiping away the tear tracks, forcing her mouth to close and willing her eyes to blink, only to see dead children behind her eyes, snapping open a moment later.
She was too trained and strong to be sick, but she wished at that moment she could be. She left her caf untouched, dressed completely automatically, and left the suite without a word, she headed straight for medical, and sat beside Awne going over her thoughts as she held onto the farghul like a life line; gaze unseeing as she stared at the wall.
She needed to talk to the new Moff. She needed to tell Krayt off. She needed to get medical aid sent to Bastion. She....she needed to make things right...make something right...

As Daiyu set in the med bay, the medical team seemed to be doing very routine work. Stocking supplies and maintaining their droids, checking their heuristics and wiping their memory to reprogram them for maximum medical efficiency. Despite the Hangar Bay, the medical crew seemed to be proficient. Most likely the casualties sustained in the Legate Fleet had kept them from being complacent. They were on Condition Yellow. A Imperial Knight counter attack was possible. But as Daiyu saw the sterile and clean operation of the Medical Bay. The voice now spoke loudly in her head.

*"Why?"*

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*Malificere has also gained Intimidation influence on the crew of the Vindicator. Obviously this differs from loyalty influence like Commodore Daiyu has. These differences will be passive stats that affect the crew that will require you to pay close attention to the men and women under your charge. Daiyu and Malificere please make opposing persuasion checks. Malificere makes an intimidation and Daiyu makes a persuasion. This is a general leadership check you have to take since being on the ship and taking charge of your ship. You may spend FP's or DP if you deem it necessary. This can affect promotion.*

Daiyu shifted her head to the side, brow furrowing *'why what?'* she questioned the voice. She didn't understand...why was the force so easy for the sith...even for Fel it seemed so easy...hell his daughter seemed to be able to use it with ease! what was wrong with her? Why could she hear things, see things, feel things but...it was all so vauge. She sighed softly, blinking slowly and stood giving Awne's hand a gentle squeeze "wake soon Awne." it was something she often left with saying and hoped it reached the woman.
Leaving the med bay with a nod to them she headed for the bridge for the morning report and the intent to continue to the conference room to contact the new Moff.

Maleficere was overjoyed that the battle of Bastion was a success. It pained him that Oturis Academy had been destroyed, but beyond that...This was war. People die all the time and in some of their cases, it was better for them to die that day...thereby preventing something worse from happening to them later on. He also knew that for any Knights left in the Galaxy...their loss would be terrible and payback was a very high possibility. It would very much be like the Rebellion all over again, only this time things would hopefully turn out much different. He also made a mental note to comfort Daiyu when he got the chance. The state of respect towards him weighed heavily on his mind, making it rather annoying but he had more pressing matters.

Lieutenant Tysiri had informed Commodore Daiyu and Darth Malificere to return to the Chamber of Offering by Darth Krayt's order. They were likely to continue the interrogation. He also had reported he had the official Battle Damage Assessment for Bastion. Malificere may be thinking the tide of the war had to certainly be turning. But that thought might have been interrupted as he dealt or passed by his subordinates. He could....sense the fear in them. Everywhere he walked across the one and a half kilometer long Capital vessel, everyone had the tinge of fear and respect about them. He had heard rumors that some Imperials dreaded duty under a Sith...most notably the commander of the vessel and their second in command. Any insubordination or failure to complete a task resulted in swift and lethal punishment. He might recall being called Admiral Alvar, when he was respected as someone who knew naval strategy and was an excellent orator. Now he was a Sith; matters had changed greatly. Would the crew ever come to respect Daiyu in the matter that they did Alvar? Did the name Alvar even bear meaning for Malificere anymore? However, the Imperials remained as dutiful as ever, rendering salutes and standing by to assist the Sith at a moment's notice. It was likely one of the reasons several Imperials decided to side with Roan Fel and strictly adhere to the Imperial Viewpoint. They chose not to adhere to the path of the Dark Side that the Sith Empire commanded. However, most beings in the galaxy didn't understand the Dark Side. They only understood the fear and power it commanded. Now, it might finally prove to be true. Bastion had suffered heavy losses, and the Imperial Knights had their leader in custody and was being mutilated.
Malificere had contributed greatly to success of this war now. Perhaps accomplishing even more than Krayt himself. Did Malificere's meditations reveal this to him? The Dark Side's grip on the galaxy now would only grow. Did Malificere even realize the implications of change he had endured over the years since the time he was a small slave child? So long ago, when there was nothing but tinkering with speeder bikes, arm wrestling, and foraging runs. Now there was the Skywalker, the Forges, and the Death Star. But at the other end of it....where did Daiyu stand in all of this? Where would Darth Krayt be? If anything his actions alone were proving him to be the heir of Palpatine. Perhaps it was time to ready a shuttle to see his Master.

Daiyu nodded her head looking over the morning report and then taking the report from the battle a frown on her lips and a furrow to her brow. She ignored the Sith's presence for the moment, choosing instead to move to the conference room where she worked on the message she intended to send to Moff Tunkin; she needed to make sure she had it finished. Even if she didn't get a chance to send it yet. She supposed she could always use the communications planet side again while they interrogated Fel, she did not want to be there for that. And she shouldn't have to be, she reasoned with herself, she wasn't a Sith...she could barely call herself a force user, and with this...this...echo of a voice in her head she didn't think she was in the best state to be doing any kind of interrogation. She would however go down, and ask him again to tell her where Cade was, in exchange for ending things sooner and giving him a quick death.
Once her message was completed on her data pad, and a thought sent to the echo of Last memory? She left the room and then the bridge, giving it back over to the Lieutenant with the order to keep her informed of anything that happens, she headed for the hanger and a waiting shuttle.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-10 17:54:42)

As Commodore Daiyu entered the Nune shuttle, some crew members with black naval crew helmets were doing some pre-flight checks. The passenger bay was soothingly quiet as the few men spoke silently checking the instruments of the shuttle. If there was any one thing that was constant in this galaxy besides war, was the quiet solitude of the life of a spacer. Being alone, surrounded by a blanket of stars with only a hull of durasteel to separate you from the unlimited tranquility of space. She might be quieting her thoughts and stretching her feelings, when she noticed that the pilot hadn't arrived yet, nor was Malificere here. She thought she heard the men speaking to her...but once again...it was that voice.

*"Qui-Gon."*

### **zerah** (2013-02-10 18:05:41)

The words from the echo had her atop dead in her tracks part way to the shuttle, eyes wide and barely breathing as her mind went into overdrive. Qui-gon was a name she knew well, she had studied the great war like everyone else the war that began there on nabo that led to Lord Vader following the path that called for him.
Qui-gon Jin. General Kanobi's teacher...who found Lord Vader and willed him to be taught, caught the council the story goes and Kanobi trailed him.
This voice a last memory was of Qui-gon?? How?? She needed more, dead? Alive? She asked quickly, she had to know if she was going to figure this out

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-10 18:14:19)

Maleficere arrived shortly behind Daiyu and placed a hand on her shoulder with a concerned voice. **"Dai? Are you alright? You -do- realize your standing in the middle of the hallway…yeah?"** He offered her a half-smile, knowing fully well that in some part he was to blame for the death and destruction, and while that was simply war he hoped that she would not blame him for Krayt's part as well as his complete disregard for children or women's lives. That was one thing Maleficere would never dream of doing, hurting innocent children. He would have to advise that next time, they take the children and educate them to their ways, and give them a choice when they were older....and kill them if they refused. That was how it -should- have been handled. As much of a loose cannon as Krayt still was, however, his role was still to come...and Alvar needed Krayt to stay alive until he could no longer serve the Empire to his best ability. He had studied the story of Darth Plaguis very carefully as a Sith, and came to understand that even the mightiest Sith...any Sith, would fall if they let their guard down. Maleficere would NOT make that mistake. He also knew that he had better be damn well rewarded for his part in their victory against the Knights.

### **zerah** (2013-02-10 18:24:37)

Daiyu couldn't breathe, her heart was racing, she threw her mind to the force, eyes in seeing as she searched for the voice with her rudimentary ability. Alive in the force, she didn't know records for that, but only few would have seen a ghost like that right?? Probably other force users so..so this person was either sensitive or was a Jedi or Sith and Qui-gon had been a Jedi so a Sith was unlikely so this was...this was a Jedi or a sensitive. She needed answers to narrow the list on her head,before the war or after? She questioned quickly, then threw out the next just as fastmale or female?
She couldn't hear Alvar over the sound of her own heart beat in her ears, eyes blanked off to the outside world in favor of force and facts from lessons running through.

How? How could he be on the ship? She turned right around and be brushed her senses out, he was on the ship...She had to find him. He knew a Jedi and didn't know where he was, he would be in danger if...no she had to find him first. She set off walking at a hurried pace, her database slipping from her nerveless fingers. It wasn't important eight then, and made her way after her senses rebellion war? she questioned needing more information.

Years ago she thought to herself then to him she thought of the best way to describe it Darth Vader It had been Lord Vader's war as much as palpatine's but she thought perhaps Vader would be the better way to describe it. Maybe he didn't know that war than...which other? the Clone war perhaps? maybe...
There was a nagging sense that she had to be somewhere else, that she couldn't just...go looking through the ship but...She pushed that away, she had to find him, she had to. She broke into a run and followed the sense in the force that flowed to him. She had to find him.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-10 20:19:45)

Malificere noticed that something was strangely amiss with Commodore Daiyu. While traveling down the main passageway of the port side towards the hangar bay, she looked unsettled and turned in the opposite direction. She was heading for a lift. Malificere must be wondering what was going on? But did they want to keep Darth Krayt waiting? The voice continued in Daiyu's head.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*"I barely remember."*

### **zerah** (2013-02-10 20:28:14)

So he had been there but it was long ago? could it...was it possible? The image of her holocron, hidden in her room, still unlocked, still unable to tell her anything and this echo that didn't know where he was that had seen Qui-gon as a force ghost and barely remembered the war...it couldn't be though right? because...because things like that, luck, fate all of that didn't happen to her right??
She skidded into the lift and nearly punched the wall to get where she needed to go, where she felt him, it couldn't be because...because he wasn't that lucky. Should she ask? did she dare get her hopes up? maybe it wasn't though, maybe it...maybe...Skywalker? she asked, her heart in her throat as she took in a shallow gasp of air; she couldn't be that lucky could she?

*"Yes, Grand Master Skywalker…he is here."*

Could this be registering right? Commodore Daiyu checked to make sure the holocron was on her, this could be some Force anomaly. Nevertheless, she left Malificere as she ran down the port side past all the busy crew members preparing for the hangar bay launch and TIE fighter refueling/maintenance. The dark polished durasteel floor was so smooth she almost slipped as she passed through a primary door with a hiss. She was following her instincts and then turned into a smaller room where she was tracing the disturbance.
This was, a cargo hold? Various plasteel bins and deactivated cargo droids were scattered about. The black and gray color scheme was typical for the Imperial design. She noticed behind a wall of plasteel crates there was a luminescent green energy being cast from the shadows. This was the presence?

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-10 21:00:37)

Daiyu skidded nearly past the door, grabbing the wall to stop herself and burst through the door, vaguely, distantly, hearing it hiss closed behind her. She had grabbed her hill from from its hiding place before racing back to this room. Luke was with him, Luke was here on her ship somehow.
Her mind continued to play that over and over again.
She looked around the room slowly, sight returning to the real world in time to spot the green glow. Slowly she moved towards it, shifting crates to gain access. Her heart hammering in her chest as she looked to see who it was. What it was.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-10 21:09:49)

Daiyu peered around the corner to see a shadowy figure with their back to her. A green lightsaber blade was humming in the gentle darkness of the cargo hold. The person had not seen her...or rather was not concerned with her. Was it Invictus? Another Sith?

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-10 21:13:58)

Daiyu stared, eyes wide. She didn't know anyone that had a saber that color. Slowly she took a small step back, needing to put a small distance for safety and silently removed her own saber to have...to just in case. She looked over the person before her before focusing hard to say through the force and speak at the same time "Turn, please."
She wondered in the back of her head, if that had sounded as desperate for answers as she thought it sounded. It didn't matter though, she left like her heart had stopped and her breathing with it as she waited.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-10 22:29:47)

Daiyu spoke to the person, but they remained there...the lightsaber continued to hum in a eerie fashion. As she said that, her comlink chirped in her pocket. The person didn't acknowledge the comlink and continued to face away from the Commodore.

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-10 22:33:47)

She ignored the chirp of her com focused on the person before her "turn…please turn…look at me." she requested each time a little more desperate, in the back of her head she had started to wonder if he wasn't really there...what I'd she was going crazy?
Changing it she reaches out, tensed to pull back quickly but reached for his shoulder.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-10 22:36:59)

The person turned to face Daiyu, he was dressed in a black tunic and a black cloak....with matching boots. The man raised his green lightsaber in a fighting stance typical of a Jedi. The man spoke, **"You must free us."**

Her comlink continued to chirp as she was seeing what was likely unbelievable. As he kept his lightsaber straight ahead in a graceful posture; an explosion could be heard what sounded like a couple of decks above.

### **zerah** (2013-02-10 22:50:57)

She stared at him, eyes widening as she took a step towards him "Luke…but…" she gasped in a breath, her father? but...but he...he was dead wasn't he? that..that was why she hadn't been raised with him right? so..what was he doing here? on her ship...how did he get on her ship???
She wanted to ignore her com, but the sudden sound of explosion tore her gaze from him, to look back towards the door and down to the com; her gaze turning back to him sharply even as she answered her com "Daiyu." she said into it look at him with her own green eyes that matched his saber.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-10 23:01:29)

There was a garbled response that came in. —"This is Lieutenant Commander Terridine from Medical. We've been trying to reach you for a few moments now….*cough*…it seems the patient listed Awne Tora has used some sort of energy weapon and has set off a blast in the Med Bay. Most of the equipment has been wrecked or damage. We're assessing casualties now and the the patient is on the move. Before the blast happened I monitored her and she was turning around on her side. She mentioned something about freeing *'you'*. We're setting the ship to Condition Red to catch the patient."—
Luke Skywalker continued to watch Commodore Daiyu as to what her next move would be. His eyes looked experienced as the lightsaber blade's illuminated his face.

He was still there. He was still therehewasstilltherehewasstilltherehewas still. there.
She wasn't dreaming him.
She wasn't hallucinating...he was really still standing there in front of her.
She stared at him, the words from the lieutenant commander running through her head again before she brought it up to her lips; Awne was moving, she was...trying to free her? "Belay that." she said calmly "Monitor her progress and clear the areas before her of personnel." she orders; no one needed to get hurt if she was trying to find her.
She lowered the com and continued to stare at Luke "How…did you get here…?" she questions softly, taking a step towards him again, her saber hand putting the hilt back in it's hiding place on her person before twitching towards him. She had her father she'd never known personally before her, she needed to make sure he was real, maybe he knew where Cade was too...maybe...maybe they could...be a family? was that possible?

Darth Malificere walked into the cargo hold to notice that Daiyu was speaking into the shadows. However he didn't see anyone there. When Malificere came into the room; Skywalker was no longer there. It was as if Malificere shook Daiyu out of a dream. Daiyu's comm received a response.
**—Ma'am? You don't want a security lockdown? This patient just attacked everyone in the Med Bay? I'll go to nearest security control room to track Awne. A trooper unit will also be in pursuit shortly. However, she moved incredibly fast. She moved faster than any humanoid I've ever seen."**

### **zerah** (2013-02-11 15:00:49)

Daiyu turned to see Alvar rush in, blinking at him before turning back to the Jedi master...just to fine nothing.
No....
No!
"no! No come back!" she cried out the shadows but...he was gone. She bit back a sudden sob, turning and refusing to cry while she lifted her com, forcing her tone to be less snappish.
"and how would you react to waking up in a place you don't know?" she questions over the com, leaving the hold to try and see about intercepting the woman "where is she now."

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-11 15:04:36)

The comm crackled back off as the Lieutenant Commander as she was moving towards the nearest security station. Moments later, Daiyu's commlink chirped again.
**—"Ok, Ma'am. I'm tracking her via holocam. She is making her way to a turbolift via the medical deck. She appears to be pushing through personnel and is moving quite fast. If she runs into a stormtrooper, not sure how they will react."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-11 15:33:46)

Daiyu very nearly growled as she grabbed alvar's wrist and made a run for the lift "I want everyone cleared from the hallways!" she ordered into her com, she didn't want anyone hurting Awne or worse her hurting someone by accident "And the troopers should be getting people away not firing at her dammit!" She ran for the lift, "I need to know where she is going."
Through the force she focused and felt out for the woman 'Awne stop.' she said through the force, trying to emit calm feelings before adding on 'return to medical.'

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-11 20:38:54)

—"Solid copy Commodore. We've halted the lift she was on. But we no longer have visual. It was one of the service turbolift shafts. That could lead anywhere in the maintenance decks, engineering, or the primary engine couplings. However, as far as the ROE's for the Stormtroopers, they are trained to fire in self-defense…and she has already attacked."—
Commodore Daiyu was moving through the passage way as she spotted an Imperial stormtrooper pair following a mouse droid. Most likely they were headed Awne's way.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-11 20:56:05)

Maleficere allowed Awne to lead them as they went quickly, talking to her in hushed tones. **Dai…what the hell is going on?? First you run off when we are supposed to meet with Krayt, now the Farghul is loose?! If we cannot keep it together right now things could get very upsetting for all involved! Now you tell me what is wrong here! Why did you run off like that!"**

### **zerah** (2013-02-11 21:08:05)

"Because I had heard him, I had heard him when we came on board two days ago and it just got stronger and stronger and I realized he was on the ship and I had to get to him first and then Awne got loose and she said she had to free you, which is what he said so we're going to find her and Krayt be damned, I'm going to find her." Daiyu shouted back at him, she felt wired as she ran after the troopers "Tranq's only, don't you dare hurt her in any way shape or form or I will pay it back on you." She ordered/threatened of them, moving to the lift.
she lifted her com to her mouth again "No live fire, tranq's only if they have to shoot but they should just stay out of her way if they can help it." she ordered over the com, getting in the lift once it arrives "What was the nearest level that her lift was stopped at?" she questions over the com.

Maleficere listened to what she had said before simply offering a nod. **"Then tell me what I can do to help Dai. If you say you saw him, then I believe you saw him…vision or him actually here."**
He then opened his com and said to all personal. **"Anyone that does not follow Commodore Daiyu's orders on this matter, will deal with me as well as dishonorably discharged for not following a superior officer's command…and that last one is only if you survive."**

The ship's vox began a professional address to all personnel of a patient who was considered dangerous and to set weapons to stun. It also goes on to list that the patient was last seen on deck 36. Daiyu had heard this alongside Malificere as they arrived on said deck to notice the damages from the Med Bay. Medical equipment and some droids were scattered from the Med Bay to the passage way. The medical personnel seemed to be fine with minor wounds and they were headed down the passageway to the lift Awne had taken. Once Daiyu and Malificere arrived at the lift, they noticed the lift had been locked down. Awne should be trapped in the turbolift.

Daiyu stepped from the lift and moved down the hall to the service lift, taking notice of the damage done but was glad to see that the people from the med bay hadn't been hurt too badly; that had to mean that she had been aware of herself when she woke. That was good. That was very very good.
Coming up to the lift Daiyu frowned as she eyed it, she didn't believe for a moment that Awne was still inside, turning to Alvar she frowned "go up a floor. I don't think she'd be fool enough to stay in the lift. Likely she'd have gone up a floor from the cables, if you go up one you might catch her…and talk to her." She said softly, nodding at him "hurry, I'm going to see if maybe she did stay there."
She moved to the lift doors, motioning troopers away from it before she paused just in front of it, and knocked twice on the doors, listening.

Maleficere nodded and idly wondered if she would listen to a Sith...This was someone who was incredibly dangerous, and they did not even begin to be able to understand her. Daiyu was the closest to that, so while he made his way up to the next floor he felt his way through the force, trying to see if he could somehow gauge her affinity and see just what they were dealing with. He would also have pulled a number of troopers with him through use of his com, at least five or so and would have them await his orders out of sight...but within distance to be able to help if she attacked. So he now stood outside the lift, one floor above where Daiyu was...and felt his way through the force.

Malificere moved through the upper level as he reached out with the Force, the area was quite saturated with Stormtroopers attempting to head off the patient. There was also a black-uniformed naval officer commanding the crew. He withdrew the men as soon as he saw Malificere. As Malificere searched through the Force, he felt Awne's presence shine brilliantly. It was unlike any other presence he had detected with the Force. She almost seemed, unnatural with her affinity.
Meanwhile, as Daiyu knocked on the sealed turbolift door, she heard a hollow echo. Where was Awne now? The stormtroopers looked as stoic as ever as they stood ready with their E-11's.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-13 15:26:05)

Maleficere felt suddenly very uncomfortable around this new type of energy..it felt even more in quantifiable means than Lord Krayt's...He would have to tread extremely lightly. He moved to the lift doors, calming himself as he did so, and knocked on the doors with a gentle closed fist three times to let her know, if she was there, that he was not going to be a threat. He only hoped that, being a Farghul, she was not in a feral state at the moment. He waited silently as he backed a few feet away from the doors.
A thought suddenly came to him, he grabbed his com and spoke to the ship. **"I want the bridge on full alert, shoot to stun not kill, and the same goes for the com room.** If he was an escaped...whatever, and scared...he would try to either take over the ship or send out a distress signal. **"Do not let her near the escape pods…"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-13 21:03:43)

Malifice knocked on the duraplated lift door as the Stormtroopers watched intently. The Sith heard a hollow sound. Peculiar. Lieutenant Tysiri from the bridge meanwhile was relaying Malificere's orders and sent troops to guard the escape pods. That meant they would be deployed on the aft, port, starboard, and fore side of the ship.
The turbolift was locked down as Malificere observed the lift controls with two small blue buttons and a large red button.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-14 00:56:00)

Malificere observed the turbolift, it had already been locked down and that's what the red button via code cylinder access. He had a code cylinder and could unlock the lift at anytime. The blue buttons sent the turbolift moving up or down.
He then felt a presence in the Dark Side, tingling up his spine. "Where are you?"

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-14 07:23:42)

Daiyu hummed faintly as she listened to the echo from within she had been hoping the farghul would knock back to show she was in there but then...if she had just woken up on a ship she didn't remember with crew that weren't her own and likely wearing the uniforms of the enemy...she wouldn't have responded either.
So...if she was in Awne's shoes...well...she would have climbed the hatch and moved to the next floor. but where would she go? likely the escape pods...or bide time for someone to unlock the lift so she could continue on.
Why hadn't she answered her in the force though? could she not sense her? Better to try at least.
"Awne?" she called softly through the door, waiting a moment and then continued "Awne, my name is Daiyu." best to leave off titles for the moment "I am not going to hurt you." she added, then frowned, everyone said that didn't they? "We found you in carbonite, and protected you until you were able to come back to yourself. We will not hurt you."
Daiyu hoped she was in there and listening.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-14 08:06:03)

Maleficere took out his code cylinder and was about to use it to unlock the lift when he felt a dark presence and immediately knew that this was going to be extremely interesting. He thought for a moment before answering back **"Ship emergency."** Damn these short bursts of messages. **"Correcting it."**
He then used the code cylinder to try to bring the elevator to his location, as well as to open the doors, standing off to the side in case she was in there, ready to avoid a lightsaber blade if she tried to cut her way out.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-14 15:27:34)

Commodore Daiyu observed the turbolift and noticed that it had been locked down, much like Darth Malificere above her. Suddenly the echo returned, ***"I must go."*** The Force seemed incredibly bright with this individual. Commodore Daiyu had never felt such a presence of life. It was if...someone divine was speaking to her. Just who was this person?
Meanwhile, on Deck 37...Darth Malificere hit the switch to activate the turbolift. The lift quickly ascended and the Stormtrooper squad behind him received orders from the naval officer to be ready. The doors opened with a hiss. The lift appeared empty. Then that tinge in the Dark Side pushed into Malificere's head. *"Emergency?"*

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-14 15:32:51)

Maleficere blinked at the empty lift and then was graced with yet another message. Damn it all this was not a good time. How could he concentrate and send messages back and forth? He wasn't a damn secretary. Thank the Force Maleficere was a patient man though, and responded calmly, **"Emergency for troopers, easy for a Sith."** In truth it was a simple procedure for him and Daiyu. the troopers though would more than have their hands full if the force was indeed that strong with the Farghul. He sent a message to Daiyu, letting her know what was going on. **"Not on lift."** He paused a moment before **"Krayt is curious on situation."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-14 15:47:42)

Malificere saw the top maintenance hatch had been completely removed off the turbolift. It seemed to be removed by brute force. He could hear the quiet hum emanating from the turbolift shaft. It was dangerous in there. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-14 15:58:19)

Maleficere saw the hatch open and it made a pit fall in his stomach. Yes, it -should- be a trivial match for a Sith but at the same time....he commanded on the ship. He turned his com on and said **"I want troopers in that shaft now. I am going to contact Lord Krayt, the Commodore is in full command while I am gone."** He honestly didn't care if Daiyu ordered the troopers to not go in the shaft, so long as they could sit down and talk with this being that was all he wanted at this moment. With how strong she was, she could be a powerful ally. He turned on his heels and made his way towards the com room.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-14 23:03:30)

The naval officer looked at Malificere, puzzled by the order. **"Sir that might be a…difficult task for our stormtroopers. If one of the lifts were to become active again they may go into serious danger."** The black uniformed officer took a moment to look at the Sith then ordered a team of four stormtroopers forward. They had no way to the maintenance hatch so they had to boost each other up to the top of the turbolift in a cumbersome fashion. One of the white armored soldier's feet disappeared from view as he lifted himself into the darkness above of the turbolift. The first stormtrooper looked up inside the darkened turbolift shaft. ***"Sir, low-light vision activated. No sign of the target."***
Malificere's comlink then chirped. It was Lieutenant Tysiri who was checking in with the Sith. **—"Sir, we're detecting a power failure on decks 42-57. What are our orders? Specifically the aft section of the ship."—**
Commodore Daiyu also hears this comm chatter, as she was apart of the command crew's frequency.

As he had walked away towards the com room, he had said something under his breath about the incompetence of the Officer. **"Damnit. Fine then, come back down Trooper, regroup with the Commodore."** he said into his com. The troopers were in danger whenever they went into battle yet he thought they would be hesitant about an elevator shaft? He made a mental note to have the Naval Officer re-evaluated at the soonest convenience. The com chirp though had made him pause in his steps and think on a course of action.

The sub-lieutenant moved forward and ordered the stormtrooper to climb down. "Well the only way he could see anything more is by climbing the turbolift shaft. But that person is most definitely nimble and we've lost them for now."
Darth Malificere heard this report and then took a moment to ponder the power outage in the reported operating decks by Tysiri. He didn't know the Imperial Class II Destroyer as he did the Adjudicator. But he knew for a fact there was sensitive ship systems that have been powered down. He just wasn't sure what kind. Weapons, hyperdrive, engine, interal security measures... He couldn't pinpoint for sure. This patient had to be moving fast to cause such sabotage though. What further threats were plausible to the ship? Then it happened again, that haunt of the Dark Side. "Shall I join you?"

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-15 17:23:50)

Daiyu frowned at the messages coming at her both through the force and the com. She turned straight away for the main lift, lifting the com to speak "Where would one have to be to cut the power to those decks." she questions "What's on those decks as well." She needed to know, there had to be a reason for this.
She breathed deep as she walked and switched the frequency to Alvar's com "Tell him it's sensitive." she said and frowned more "He knows about her but…" she sighs and nibbles her lip before finally "Just…tell him a patient's awake, and frightened. Flight risk. That we have to handle this personally, she's been under my care too long for me to back down when she needs help." she says finally, the last nearly whispered. "If we can't get her to calm down and talk to us than it might be helpful to have backup available." she explains.
Breathing deep again as she comes up on the lift she reaches out for the bright light of energy that is the Farghul "Awne." she says "Friends." she bites her lip and adds "Please come to me."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-15 22:12:17)

The comm link responded in the Commodore's hands. ---"Those decks house the primary engine couplings, security control stations, holocams, 4 turbolaser batteries, subspace relays, drag fins, tractor beam control, and the aft sensor array. The rest is cargo space, no troop personnel garrisoned there either. All she would have to disable power is from one of the maintenance ducts, but you need code cylinder clearance. Or she could also disable power from several control stations on any of the decks. Unless she breached by force. But as of now we can't track her via surveillance."---
Commodore heard the information relayed. Then, the Force came alive within Daiyu once again. "I know, but I must go."

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-15 22:19:02)

Daiyu sighed loudly, nearly going so far as to bang her head against the wall. Of all the...why. just. why.
How did this become her life? She was chasing a farghul. a cat. who was wrecking havock to her ship because she apparently had to go.
Grumbling she paced by the lift and sent out her thoughts to the other woman 'Why' was the first than 'where' and then finally nearly desperately she pleaded 'let me help'

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-15 23:54:19)

The vergence occurred once again in the Force. "To find Qui-Gon."

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-16 00:00:37)

Daiyu again felt at a loss, weren't these people dead? she was certain he was! even father had said that he was a force spirit...so how...
again she tried Let me help. Why couldn't this be easy, stubborn girl just let her help so the ship and crew don't suffer.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-16 00:59:50)

The voice continued to ring through Daiyu's ears. This Force presence was unique...it was calm...serene. Unlike any other Force practicioner she had encountered.
**"Get me a ship."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-16 07:10:08)

Daiyu breathed a sigh of relief, finally...progress.
Getting into the lift she tapped the panel for the hanger calling out to the force to both the bright energy of Awne and the darker of Alvar hanger. She'd meet them there and get thing ready.
Turning back to the com she changed the frequency back to the Lieutenant Commander "i want a ship prepped in the hanger and the crew evacuated out except for prep crews. No troopers."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-16 08:46:35)

The Lieutenant Commander responded via the comlink channel which was now bustling with chatter. ---"Roger, we will see to that. Interrogative, do you need anything else?"---

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-17 18:03:22)

Commodore Daiyu went to the main hangar bay on the lower floors on the port side. She observed that were no stormtroopers but they were awaiting outside in the passageways. The hangar bay housed a Lambda class shuttle that was being prepared by the deck crews and droids. The Nune Class shuttles were not being used, likely because they weren't going to give a stranger access to a more advanced craft. The Commodore approached the spacious hangar bay to a crowd of hand salutes and military discipline. Sub-Lieutenant Krams reported the shuttle would be ready in about 15 minutes for flight as it had been kept in an unready status.
Daiyu might also be aiding with the pre-flight with a cursory examination. She might be looking at the exhaust ports, wings, and the main turbines. It was definitely a sleeker design than the bulky cargo transport style of the Nune shuttle. As she conducted her inspection, the Commodore did not see Awne anywhere in sight. She should be here already, judging at the speed she had maneuvered from the medical bay into the upper decks from the turbolift. Honestly though, the patient was unpredictable. Awne had not responded to her message through the Force. What was her next move?

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-18 06:49:44)

Daiyu kept watch on the shuttle and the time, she did not want them to sabotage the shuttle in favor of containing Awne. That wasn't right...then again she doubted they would without an order...at least she hoped.
All the same she kept careful watch.
No sign of Awne though, no answer through the force, she had to be in the room though. Waiting. Daiyu frowned faintly, it's what she would do. She'd wait until the hanger was empty of everyone but the person helping before showing herself.
That was the paranoid way. The smart way. only way in her opinion.
"As soon as you finish you are all dismissed from the hanger." she said to the crew quietly, no need for her voice to echo.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-18 08:43:13)

Maleficere reached the comm room before giving a furrowed brow. No. He didn't need Krayt there. He was a Sith, and he could get things done or sorted out himself. Still...If she blew up the ship or had shut off life support or force knows what else then it could very well be a bad end...Too many thoughts. **"No need, My Lord."** He then moved towards the hangar in the hopes that it was where Awne was headed, hopefully to be able to talk her into settling down if not just for a few minutes to gain some information.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-18 15:22:46)

After the pre-flight checks were complete; the entire deck crew left the main hangar to their dismay. A few quiet minutes after this, a metallic clank could be heard in the distance of the hangar. It had come from a ventilation duct. Then, before the two knew it, the farghul was walking forward calmly to the Lambda shuttle.
It was unreal to see. This feline like individual who had seemed hopelessly lost appeared to be a fully capable creature. She seemed calm...serene. The farghul began ascending the docking ramp to the passenger bay. She didn't even acknowledge the two Force practicioners.

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-19 06:43:06)

Daiyu watched the crew leave and then waited. Thankfully not having to wait long before the sound hit her ears; she looked up sharply to watch the woman land and walk towards them.
She straightened her spine and shirt, pushing her shoulders back before moving out to meet her by a few steps, cautious. "Awne?" she called softly "Will you speak to us before you leave?"

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-19 07:51:26)

Maleficere stood next to Daiyu with his arms crossed, not sure exactly how comfortable he was in such a situation. Either way, he stood there and cleared his throat. Knowing that it was more than likely she already knew he was there. **"We DID just help facilitate your escape you know. The least you could do is offer a thank you or something…It is understandable if you cannot stay, but a simple thank you is all I ask from you at the very least, if not just to Daiyu."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-19 21:27:16)

The farghul stopped in her tracks, her beige and white Jedi robes swaying gently as the docking ramp sprayed out a cloudy mist. She turned to Daiyu. **"Thank you for everything. There is a great disturbance in the Force…here…and all around us."**
Her eyes glanced over Darth Malificere, but it looked as if she had trouble focusing on him. She had trouble looking at Daiyu as well. **"My friends, I must find them. I know where to go to see them. They are waiting for me."**

All we need…is the location of where to find an individual called Cade Skywalker. If you CANNOT give us a location…any information in general, maybe how to contact him, would be helpful as well."**

The farghul seemed visibly shook up by the news that Commodore Daiyu. She could no longer stand...so she sat down awkwardly in the landing ramp. The person in Jedi attire was so shaken she evade the question posed by Darth Malificere. **"Vor'en………Kaz. The Sith…it's their fault."**
As Commodore Daiyu got closer, she noticed Awne's eyes were blank. The farghul wasn't focusing on anything in particular, yet she was looking beyond everything.
**"Am I a…..Jedi?"**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-20 23:20:09)

Daiyu moved more to her side, kneeling down and gently resting a hand on the other's arm "Voren..that was the human? your ship that you were on, the star forge, it was under water…his carbonite melted before the ship had drained…that wasn't a Sith's fault..it..it was faulty I guess…we couldn't save him though we tried." She glanced up to Alvar "We kept his tags…we can give them to you…Kaz…um…"
She stopped and looked to the woman with a sigh, wrapping her arms around her in what she hopped to be a comforting hug "you are what you choose to be." she says softly and glances to alvar again "If you are Jedi or not, we'll keep you safe..and we'll help you."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-20 23:54:03)

Awne returned the Commodore's embrace. "I guess, all my friends are one with the Force. The Sith captured Kaz, Voren, and myself after a battle with a Sith Lord named Darth Strife. An explosion beforehand rendered us unable to resist. The rest in our group perished. The Sith encased us in carbonite in the Star Forge. The reason I do not know. By Sith I mean the species. I must return to the Star Forge you found me in."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-21 15:31:51)

Maleficere hesitantly spoke as she mentioned the Star Forges. **"Unfortunately, Lady Awne….that is more difficult than you would suggest it to be. Darth Krayt is expecting Daiyu and myself to meet with him soon. He is aware there was a disturbance on board this ship…and COULD very well be on his way here. Also, if we took off for the Star Forges he would know right away."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-21 16:17:02)

Daiyu quickly brushed a soothing hand over the other's shoulder "The galaxy's changed a lot in the years you've been asleep..." she glances to alvar and back to the woman "And the forge is protected, it attacks anyone that comes near it that it doesn't recognize...you could get hurt." She pauses a moment and shifts a little "But if you stay here with us...on the ship and rest, when we've finished with our business we can take you to the forge." She glances back to Alvar "They've begun to decode some of the information, I'd like to go back and see if we can help." she explains, as well as offering him the excuse they can give...or a start of one.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-21 16:42:49)

Awne looked to Darth Malificere. **"Darth… Krayt would know if a shuttle left? Who is Darth Krayt? I don't have time for this. You must let me go. My friends are waiting. A species beyond comprehension needs me."**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-22 08:09:39)

Maleficere rolled his eyes and stared crossly at her. His patience, was wearing extremely thin...though he had a bit more left in him before he said to hell with it all. **Darth Krayt is the current Emperor…and the self acclaimed and recognized One Sith. He is very strong in the force, and would no doubt be able to know if a shuttle left the ship or not, especially when Daiyu and myself have not shown up for our meeting. Seeing as how he has a very special item of mine, I do not intend to piss him off by just missing a meeting. Now, if you can WAIT for just a few hours…then perhaps we would be able to put something together as an excuse to go to that particular sector. But if it is too interesting, Krayt would want to come along as well. So you will just have to MAKE time. Your friends are dead, a cold hard fact. They will not be going anywhere I believe, so really you have all the time in the world. As for the species, if you refer to the Rakatan…They can wait as well. I believe they would rather us arrive a bit late…rather than not at all, which is a grave possibility if you cannot be patient. Now, are you willing to wait and help contribute ideas to help us get to the Star Forge without Krayt knowing? Or are you just going to ignore everything I just said….and try to find it yourself."**
Maleficere finished speaking, and continued to stare at the Farghul. He was a patient man...but yet again, it was very depleted currently.

The farghul nodded her head at the Sith Lord. **"I see. I have delicate matters to attend to. It does involve the Rakatan, but that is not the species I was referring to. If Darth Krayt or you wish to pursue me, so be it."**
She looked at her paws and nodded solemnly. **"For I have grown strong in the Force."** The farghul ascended the rest of the way up the Lambda shuttle. **"I know where my destination is, and you should have no problems finding me again. Now, I shall depart."**
The farghul waved her hand and the ramp began to close with the power of the Force. The farghul gave Commodore Daiyu one last look before the ramp sealed with a hiss. After a few moments, the luminescent blue turbines of the Lambda shuttle fired to life. The noise would slightly blur out any conversation between the Commodore and the Sith. The shuttle began hovering on a relatively brisk vector to exit the hangar bay. She was escaping. What was to be done? And what species was she referring to, the Sith? The Sith were believed to be possibly extinct, or in hiding due to their mysterious nature. However, the culture of the Sith would live on through their teachings to people like Darth Krayt and Darth Malificere.

### **zerah** (2013-02-22 21:41:29)

Daiyu moved off the ramp to let the other go and shifted a bit to stand beside the Sith lord and out of the way. Crossing her arms over her chest she watched the shuttle leave the bay before sighing and looking to the Sith. Shaking her head faintly "let her go then, we know where she's headed. We can catch up later." She says and turns to her com "Get everyone back to work, and get prep crews back to the hanger we having a meeting with Kryat and we've made him wait long enough."
