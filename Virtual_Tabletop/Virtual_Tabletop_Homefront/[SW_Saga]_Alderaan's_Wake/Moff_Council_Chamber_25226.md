# Moff Council Chamber

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-01 21:05:14)

While Moff Alexander Kane handled his discussion with one of his favored Naval commanders; a TC droid interrupted his conversation. "Sir, I have the sector report for this month. May I get you anything else?" The droid said as he handed over an encrypted code cylinder. The data contained information on thousands of inhabited worlds in which he was ultimately responsible for its governance. He would delegate down to all pertitent system governors his orders and thoroughly enforce them. The Moff plugged in the code cylinder and a vast Holodisplay in red-formatted elegance appeared in front of him, displaying a pleortha of information that only a politican would really understand.
It was collection of all his important dates, arrangements, laws, taxes, and policies. He would go over them and handle business as usual.

In other news, Grand Admiral Rulf Yage has the most problems from the hit-and-run tactics from the Galactic Alliance Remnant's Rogue Squadron; who are able to attack key systems and avoid defeat by utilizing speed, aggression, and surprise. You may use Knowledge Tactics to aid against the 501st or Rogue squadron. Both requiring a Knowledge Tactics of CL 12/37. You are free to choose one, or both if your number of checks allow it.

You may make these rolls for each cooresponding political duty to aid Moff Tunkin. The results will be displayed in the main thread. Additional systems will be added to the Raiballo sector report. Perform well in your duties and your influence will expand, as well as experience and credits/resources. This might also open the door politically to stray you to the offices of a Moff Council member or toward the position of Admiral. Your experience received will also receive a percentage modifier if your sector and presence is in good standing with the Moff Council and Sith. To respond to this post you may respond with a roleplay or simply roll for the appropriate checks. To roll dice using the forums use the (dice)1d20+14 (/dice) option and substitute the parentheses with brackets to get the correct syntax. Any successful checks can eventually lead to a stronger overall Sith Empire presence with time as the Raiballo sector prospers. Make a good first impression on Moff Tunkin, and he may further seek your advice.
Also, you may only make a number of checks equal to 1/2 your heroic level (rounded down). This represents that you are a busy politician and that governance/laws take time to pass through and great oversight. You are only one man and can only get so much done in a set amount of time. You may reroll any checks free of this if you have the appropriate talents (such as knack). But in any case, you may only do this reroll once.

TC-22 walked into the ceremoniously decorated office of the Moff's quarters, making sure to bring with him his favorite wine in plasteel wares that were polished to a mirror sheen, just like the TC droid itself. The droid knew that it was better to always come to the Moff bearing pleasantries before turning in the usual sector report.
The TC droid laid down his assortment of winery and then stood up in mechanical fashion, waving his arms about quite stiffly. "Sir, I have the latest reports from the Alurion System. If you would like to hear them."
TC-22 did not bother with any datapad or anything of the like, but he did had the Moff an encrypted code cylinder which could be used to view the report at a later date. TC-22 looked about cautiously and began in true protocol fashion.
"It seems the Moff Council is particulary perturbed at your lack of reports to them last week. However, I had one of your assistants see to it that you were busy with procedure concerning Alliance forces in the Alurion System. I got the message that this wasn't the wisest of moves and that they hope that the Alurion system turns out to bear more military value than it's currently worth."
He observed the Moff's reactions, making sure that he didn't reach into his desk or anything of the sort.
"However, our Naval and Army forces report scattered forward operating bases on Alurion that have are manned by meager crews. Our forces were able to destroy the bases. However, we were unable to find them all, and little items of intelligence value were discovered. And on another note sir, Governor Zash Oles' appreciates your attentiveness to the matter of crime and piracy. But he is wondering if it wouldn't be too much trouble to have a detachment or a cruiser to patrol his system for safe measure."
TC-22 seemed to mull about quite uneasily as his servo motors creaked, he then responded once more. "The Red Hoods do present a minor problem to the Alurion system at the time, and its unsure if they are going to expand or not. So it may be nothing to be too disturbed about sir. Furthermore, the citizens of Alurion seem to be quite content with their state of affairs in any event, despite their diminishining economy. They do not bear particular favor to the Empire, nor do they despise us. And to conclude my report sir, as required by Sith Doctrine, their have been no sightings or reportings of Jedi in the Alurion System." 
TC-22 turned to the door and bowed politely. "The information I have given to you is stored in the encypted comlink, and I shall return when the next sector report is available sir…" The TC unit then exited the door, past the flanking imperial flags in quite the hurry.

*These events took place before the deployment of the Moff's Fleet to Endor.*
The black polished protocol droid unit came into the Moff's decorated chambers with quite the pep in his servo motors. A human female was beside the droid, and she had a genuine smile that rippled across her ivory skin. The woman was wearing robes that were encapsulated by rounding gray shoulder pads and it was quite the eloquent fashion typical of political figures. She was around her 20's and wore brown short choppy hair. The TC droid said with enthusiasm. "Sir, I present to you, Imperial Advisor Mae Ison. She was reassigned from the Sector Governor of Dantooine and she is happy to make your acquaintance." The woman observed the other droids in the chamber and bowed to the Moff behind his desk. The woman spoke firmly, "It is an honor to see you again, we've met before, but I doubt you remember. You are a busy man." 
Mae dismisses the droid but makes sure to give him a polite nod and smile that the protocol droid seemed to appreciate. She takes out a collection of flimsiplasts, cylinders, and a singular datapad. "Seeing as how I'll be your aide I felt it necessary to bring with me your customary sector reports sir."
The woman made sure the documents were in order and then placed them on the Moff's desk, ever so neatly, making sure not to disturb the Moff's richly designed personal effects on his desk. She backed away about a foot and placed her hands behind her back. "I will begin with the military operations in Alurion. It appears the search and destroy mission we initialized with their bases have caused them to employ guerilla tactics. Our units are having trouble tracing the Alliance forces. It is believed they are planning to leave the Alurion system altogether now that we're applying full pressure to them. Where they can go from there is anyone's guess…Hopefully we can deal significantly more damage before they leave the system."
"And then we have the matter of Coruscant. We *have* gotten your name out there but we don't think many people are taking notice to it. I hate to remind you of this, but in this day and age the Moffs are recognized less and less of the political figureheads of the Sith Empire. The people respect the Sith, they fear them. If this was Grand Admiral Thrawn's Empire, it would be much different your excellency. But times have changed. People have come not to believe in the political finesse that the Moff Council offers. It has come to the sheer brutality of the Sith which has become the governing force in the galaxy."
The woman reached into crossed her hands into her robes neatly, so that you could not see her arms. "The Moff Council has also questioned your desire to engage the enemy Star Defender in such a remote location as Endor. They understand it's rarity, but that isn't even your sector. And they believe if the Alliance wants such an insignificant system its best to just let them have it, than to waste time and resources to defeat them. And….I did notice that Moff Tayus was particularly inquisitive on this matter….she seemed to be the one denouncing this idea. More so than the other Moffs, they didn't even seem to classify it as a priority." 
The woman let forth another bow, cooly and confidently she responded upon rising... "Again, it is a pleasure to serve you my excellency. This concludes my report." She exchanged a quick look at the droids that was barely noticeable, and left to attend to duties of formalities.

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-05-23 08:55:55)

Kane looks up from a datapad as the protocol droid walks in and he smiles, his eyes turn to the human female and he would stand up. He bows his head to her in greeting then offers his hand to her.
 Thank you for bringing her to me TC.
He says and then he would take the woman's hand in greeting. He looked mildly surprised that they had met before and he thinks hard and he nods slowly.
 Ahh yes, I think I remember you from when I visited Dantooine last. It is a pleasure to remake your acquaintanceship. 
He tells her formally then he would smirk a little as she dismisses the droid, albeit politely. He sinks back into his seat and he would nod his head. He would motion to one of the pair of chairs across from him infront of the desk, inviting her to sit down.
 Already getting down to business I see, I admire that trait.
He would pick up the first in the stack of reports seeing if she had itemized on the order of what matters she planned on telling him about.
I see, good, the forces there should keep the pressure on them, I would like you to look into the Alurions economy, see if you can find anywhere it could use a boost, and while you are on it, see if we have any agents on Alurion that is close to the Alliance forces, if he can slip in with them before they make their exit then we can find the next place they plan to strike and move to intercept them before they become more of an issue.
I will have to look to other areas for influence in the case of coruscant…
He frowns at the woman as she crosses her hands into her robes, not frowning at HER but the news she gives him next and he nods.
 Endor is a useless target, other than historical value of course. Taking out a valuable enemy asset there would strike a blow at the Alliances moral. They remember the victory they won there as very significant, now they will have a significant defeat there as well. There is also a capital command crew of some potential trapped on the ground there. If you would relay this information to my esteemed colleagues Tayus it should quiet her concerns, and if she still has issue, offer to set up an appointment to see me. 
He explains to her then he would nod and lean back into his seat then rises with her.
 The pleasure is all mine Adviser Ison. I look forward to working with you further.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-23 15:24:31)

*Onboard the Moff's Super Star Destroyer, Onslaught.*
Advisor Mae Ison came into the Moff's office with a sense of urgency that was glaringly obvious. She was wearing robes of a different color, a pale turquoise. She bowed quickly and got to the point. "Your excellency, your request to receive audience with Darth Krayt has cleared the Moff Council and went upwards. Apparently your message has compelled him to address you." She looked out the viewport in the hyperspace wormhole.  "However, as you know it is difficult to receive HoloNet transmissions in hyperspace and impossible to communicate via subspace radio. If we do not accept Darth Krayt's message or send him a garbled message, well…you can imagine. And if we drop out of hyperspace we will delay our time to the Endor system by additional days."
The advisor looked troubled, and definitely concerned yet faithful for the Moff.

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-05-26 13:31:46)

Kane looks up from his datapad, clicking it off, surprised by the sudden intrusion into his office. He notes Mae's urgency and he sets his pad aside.
"What is it Mae? Is everything alright?"
He blinks some at the news she brought and he shakes his head, cursing inwardly at the sudden predicament he found himself in.
"Of course, we must accept his message. Ready my personal shuttle and ensure its communications gear is working at 100%"
He orders and stands, moving to a wall, tapping a hidden button allowing a door to slide open.
"The Onslaught and her attendant fleet will continue on after dropping us off so I can have clear communications with our lord Dark Krayt, but the ships must continue on, those officers on that forsaken little moon need the support, and we can not allow such a prize as that ship escape our wrath."
He tells her then slips into his rooms to put on his best uniform and heads to the shuttlebay to board his personal shuttle, making ready his mobile office for the honors.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-29 00:24:00)

*The Super Star Destroyer emerges from hyperspace, to send a clear transmission to the Emperor Darth Krayt. Moff Kane sat deep within the superstructure of the capital vessel, surrounded by layers of thick hull and working/moving parts. Sometimes the sound of the engine exchange pipes were soothing in the long hours behind his desk and with his silent droids.*
Moff Kane heard the message over his computer-integrated comlink. "Your excellency, this is the Bridge reporting..we're patching your message through now."
The holographic image of his Emperor emerged from the black polished holographic emitter on his desk...the lights dimming automatically for better vision. All the Moff saw was the back of a throne, and then suddenly it swiveled to face him. *Note: This post is much better after reading this sentence to hit magnifying glass on the image!)*
![Krayt_throne.jpg](http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/b/bc/Krayt_throne.jpg)
"Moff….Alexander Kane is it? The Moff Council told me that you had requested audience with me…and for good reason, of that I'm sure."
At that moment, a frightening interruption occurred, Mae Ison walked into the room. "Your excellency, I have unfortunate news about Alurion's economic affairs."
The Emperor turned and faced the Imperial Aid and waved his hand in a relaxed motion. "The true unfortunate event in this matter is that you have interrupted me. Moff, I do not want this..woman… in my sight again."
Mae Ison looked to Moff Kane, searching for an apologetic look as she hoped he was her somewhat trusted advisor at this point.

*Once Moff Alexander returns to the Super Star Destroyer, Onslaught.*
Moff Alexander could see the looming space station of the Star Forge, it was such an archaic looking space station if he'd ever seen one. Meanwhile, many naval personnel made sure to clear the path for the Moff. He then made the necessary route through the port side crew quarters and began his turbolift trip down to the lower aft section, closer to engineering, but more towards the Administration offices. He walked into his eloquently furbished quarters to notice the attractive Mae-Ison, in her sleeping dress. She was arguing with a figure on the HoloNet. She turned to Moff Alexander.
"Sir, Moff Trevin has expressed his concerns. He seems to be wondering what matter of high urgency have precluded you from handling your daily political tasks?"
The advisor, having no makeup, still looked strikingly attractive. She looked in concern as to give him a hint to read between the lines.

Moff walks into his office, blinking at the woman in his office, it took a moment for him to realize it was his adviser and he nods.
"Assure Moff Trevin that I will be resuming my political tasks presently, and that I will be making a statement to the council regarding what took me away from my sector for the last several days."
He tells his adviser decisively then moves to take a seat, once she is off the holocom with the Moff he nods to her.
"Please, you had something rather urgent on your mind a few days ago, I am sorry it took me so long to get back to you. What is worrying you?"
(Can discuss the rolls tomorrow at the game I hope.)

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-06-19 02:41:30)

Mae-Lin Ison went through her datapad and promptly disposed of it within her pink flamboyant aristocratic clothes. She retrieved a handful of flimsiplast folders...
"I much prefer the old style of High Galactic Literature, it is a sign of homage to tradition, and never to rely too much on technology. I do have the latest batch of reports ready for you sir, and they are conclusive with the growing problems we've had as of late."
She took time to survey the Adjudicator's viewports, and obviously not accustomed to Naval faring life. "Your excellency, it seems that Alurion remains on the economic downturn. The cost of our grand Second-Imperial war has come significantly from this sector. Dantooine is very important in terms of farm exports, especially to nearby systems such as Alurion. But Alurion isn't producing any notable exports, nor are they doing well on trade-tariffs. So Alurion continues to remain in a poor state, economically speaking. Which brings me to my next point, apparently your motions to influence culture have worked wonders on Alurion itself. Alurion itself is primarily a 3rd world system, ravaged by war from the Yuuzhan Vong invasion in which they have not properly recovered. However, now that we are control of them they still bear resentment towards us. But now measures are being taken to advise that your guidance will make them flourish. Your inception speech as their head-of-state seems to inspire them…and you're name is being spoken much more on that system." 
"You may inspire something out of such a battered and suffered system, but what can you truly accomplish with that?"
She shifted through her folders to report the documents on Dantooine...
"It seems that Dr. Savmi Sello has accepted your contract, and was the best available we could find. He is an expert in dealing with all different types of species, and has some experience in preservation of endangered species. He has been removed from one of the labs of Bastion and is being fielded on Dantooine. And in regards to the Jedi…they continue to remain elusive as ever…but that's about what I expected your excellency."
She took a moment to fold her arms behind her back...
"Sir if I may be so bold to speak my mind freely?"

Kane watches her dispose of her the datapad and he would swirl his brandy in his snifter, looking at the moving fluid as he listens to her, nodding his head slowly.
 "Ahh yes, back in the capital I have several hard copy books I will allow you to read." 
He tells her then glances to the documents and he motions towards them with his glass before taking a sip.
 "Just ensure that you make sure that your hard copies are destroyed once their purpose has been served." 
He was sure that she would take the utmost care with how she handled the sensitive information but it never hurt to be through. He listens to her report as she looks out the view ports, nodding his head at parts and then stands up, moving to stand next to the viewport with her and admires the stars beyond the ship.
 "You ask what I can accomplish with such a planet Ms Ison… It is my world now, and was decimated as you said. It can become a symbol to the rest of the galaxy. The empire is good, and just. We can take this small ruined world and bring it back from the bring, give it glory and purpose in the universe and show what the rest of the galaxy can look forward to under our rule." 
He turns his steely grey eyes back to the adviser, tearing his gaze from the stars.
 "When they know that I have their best interests in heart and in mind they will really start to accept us. They will not chafe under imperial rule and give lip service to us as they have been. Winning the peoples hearts is as important as winning the planet after all." 
He takes another sip and listens and chuckles once she folds her arms behind her back.
 "I look forward to hearing of the doctors exploits… And those Jedi will be ferreted out sooner or later, then they can expect assassins to pay them a visit… And of course Mae-Lin, you would be of no use to me as an adviser if I didn't listen to what you have to say, so by all means tell me what concerns you." 
He tells her and motions with his hand for her to go on while he moves to his desk, setting the glass down and taking out one of his Cigaras, having a bodyguard droid light it for him.

Mae-Ison takes notice of the droids, she would think to herself this man seems unusually interested in droids for an Imperial, as most of them seemed to have a pro-human sentiment.
"Your excellency…if I may say…you seem to be taking on the most monumental tasks. Your administration is quite new and inexperienced. Even the most senior members of the Moff Council do not work as hard as you do for your governance. So, it may appear to them, as one of the younger members on the council…that you are naive and an upstart…to put it bluntly. I, however, think no such thing. I commend your efforts…but realize some tasks cannot be handled over night. Some people just will not accept leadership,no matter the soul and effort you put into it."

Mae-Ison strolled into the room, her usual collection of flimsiplasts at her disposal. She was wearing a purple/velvet like dress that shimmered. The adviser looked to the usual droid cadre noting their constant oversight on Moff Alexander.
"Well your excellency, it seems your friend Admiral Alvar has joined the order of the Sith. The current ship we're on may face an impromptu change of command….I thought you would like to know about this.. But anyways, on to the usual reports."
Mae-Ison, the attractive older female laid down the flimsi's and datapad collections, along with some encrypted code cylinders.
"All the specifics are within these documents but I'll give you a summary, as usual. Unfortunately, I have failed you yet again. Our efforts to stimulate the economy of Alurion have failed. They are just not very efficient with importing and exporting, and the planet is basically a rock with cities here and there. Turning their economy around would take gross overall action and I don't know if our administration alone can handle it. Perhaps we should enlist the aid of other Moffs? However this might perturb them."
She sifted through the flimsiplasts, trying to hide her shame at her apparent shortcomings when it came to economic factors.
"However, there is more to report on the Alurion System. You'll be pleased to know some of our officials and police have aided the authorities of the Alurion System. They've been employing Interdictor technology to disrupt the criminal activity in the area. The pirates haven't encountered technology of this magnitude. The criminals are becoming hesitant to act in the area further. So, we're making significant advancements in that system by most people's accounts."
Mae-Ison opened the dossier about the Dantooine system.
"Unfortunately, the endangered species program has been put into motion, but the results are coming back slowly. It will take some time before we know the impact of our efforts. The Dantari are in trouble but our panel reports they are confident in handling its difficulties. And as far as the Vong liasion, they are going to have the prototype testing results in soon."
She stood and backed away from the desk and provided a bow.
"You're working hard sir, I can tell. But be careful you don't take on more than you can handle. You're making progress, but I'm afraid your straining yourself in the difficult tasks and in turn hurting yourself in other areas. Please, honor my words."
