PST/CST, it's only an hour's difference. So....morning for you guys is afternoon for us.... OK we just push our preferred time slot back one time slot.

Yeah I logged on around 1am my time and checked through the servers but none of you were on yet, so I just went to bed.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**SIDE QUEST 7: SURVIVAL AND LIGHTSABER TRAINING**</span>
Time
Tomorrow 8PM CST
Slots:
Infinite
(However, the session will focus on Alvar and Daiyu and or anyone who gets the third lightsaber, if you wish to play you must be capable of RPing without any plot elements given to you).
*Quest Descriptor*
The group is planning to move to the Red Moss village to a more subtle location in which to wait out their rescue party. They don't have many rations left and the soldiers with them are injured and or dying. Will the group be able to sustain themselves before help arrives? Perhaps some lightsaber training, as Daiyu has learned, is appropriate to quite the mind and hone the senses for the upcoming difficulties.
