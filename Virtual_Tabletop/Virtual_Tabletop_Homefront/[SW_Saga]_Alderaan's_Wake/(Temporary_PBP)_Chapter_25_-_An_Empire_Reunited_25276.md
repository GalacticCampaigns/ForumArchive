# (Temporary PBP) Chapter 25 - An Empire Reunited?

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-08 21:34:26)

It was around 40 odd minutes ago that the Sith Lords had proceeded along the Ravelin City skyscraper walkways admist the bristling shops and bazaars of aristrocratic Imperial citizens. The Sith never noticed the strange looks they were receiving by the orderly Imperial citizens, but then again, they had no reason to. They were on an endeavor that was a true test to the Dark Side. All their hatred, fear, and passion was focused on this singular moment... They would be making a very unlikely meeting...
They would be standing before the Imperial Knights. They had extreme fealty to whom they called the true Emperor, Roan Fel. They represented the Imperial Viewpoint, and were strictly trained in the neutralities of the Force. They knew no anger, they knew no peace...they knew only duty. The Imperial Knights called upon the Force to uphold their duty. To protect and oversee the growth of the Empire was their only objective with the Force. The Empire was and still is the most influential organization in the galaxy. It was to that end alone, the Imperial Knights were dedicated to. That being said, the Sith knew their devotion rivaled the Jedi's or even their own Sith brethren.
The large and lumbering ceremonial doorways opened to the Imperial Knight Grand Chambers structure. In here, they were ordered to await for the summons from Knights Kelos Sarrot and Karnica Orcia...two female Imperials who had agreed to hear Lord Malificere's impassioned pleas for a motion against his own Emperor, Lord Krayt.
The Sith stalked in the hallowed, breezy halls of the Imperial Knight hallways as the torchlight illuminated their faces slightly underneath the shroud of their hooded visages. Darth Invictus had been in a practiced Dark Side meditation at the moment...and wanted to not be disturbed for several minutes. As they continued to wait in the hallways, Commodore Daiyu and Lord Malificere heard the tortured moans of Lord Invictus in a room beyond the hallway.
After what seemed like many moments of waiting, a male Imperial Knight dressed in crimson armor was striding powerfully past the stone statues that held the torches illuminating the hallways. His boots were making a distinctive *clock* sound that echoed throughout the halls. The man in armor stopped before the Sith with a slight scowl. "Lady Sarrot and Lady Orcia has informed me of your plan of a very aggressive motion to your own Emperor….can this be true?" The man looked at the duo with a high bold black hair cut. He had blue eyes that were calm yet focused, the look of someone skilled in the Force. He looked like an aristrocratic man that had simply become a warrior out of devotion and duty alone. "Where is the other Lord you have brought before us?"

Maleficere looked around at the grandeur of the City, as well as the hallway in which they were waiting. As he waited with Daiyu, hood over his face, he could not help but think on how far they had come...and just what this meeting would bring to them all.
The sound of the man approaching had him jerked from his thoughts as he now watched the male approach. Slowly he took his hood from his head and stared back at the man, looking proud in his own right. He was many things now, all of which had earned him the right to stand tall and proud. He was a count, had a fancy house on another planet, he was a Sith Lord, as well as the Son of Palpatine and he had also earned the title of Admiral almost instantly...he would NOT lose his nerve now at this most important of hours. **"It is most true, and the other Lord is meditating. Can you blame him sir…? We are about to commit, what Krayt will consider, treason. If this goes wrong for us he will most assuredly hunt us down and kill us…if not torture us before-hand."** He paused for a moment before saying **"I will have it be known now, Sir, that Krayt is not my Emperor…nor has he ever been. He is a rabid dog that needs to be put down and shoved into the dirt beneath our heels…and I have the plans that will allow this to happen."** He gave a sideways glance to Daiyu, knowing full well that she would most likely admonish him for his words later, but looked back to the Knight. **"I can only hope that Emperor Roan Fel will be understanding in this matter, and listen to our words. For many years I have waited for this moment…to finally put Krayt in his most deserved place…and now the opportunity has finally arisen, almost into my hands by itself. SO if you must ask, Sir, whether this coup is a true action to be planned out…ask yourself this. Why else would we have come willingly here, with no weapons brandished and asked so openly to speak with him? Why else would we speak of acts against the Bastard Krayt…knowing full well that their might even be spies within these very ranks…? I will tell you."** He moved to stand within an inch away from the Knight, in a non threatening stance. **"There is not a soul in this Galaxy or any other that can save him now…."**

Daiyu had paced for a long time after their arrival in the hall to simply..wait. She had been restless, nervous, she kept it to herself as much as she could but...there was a chance that this entire thing could go badly. Granted they had the backing of the two knights at least...well some backing, that was a start and it showed promise but there was still the chance.
At the sound of steps, she looked up from her position leaned against a wall; she had stopped pacing some time ago in favor of her current position. She brushed her first braid to the side with the others as she looked over to the man, her arms crossed over her uniform; unlike the other two she had no fancy robes, not that she minded really. The uniform was a comfort in itself for what was going on.
Her gaze shifted to Alvar as he rose and spoke, her lips twitching to a frown at the mention of Kryat being a rabid dog needed to be put down; it was harsh...yes she understood they had gone through a lot and it was deserved on his part but....she still had problems placing the two versions of the man side by side in her head. He had always been kind to her, respectful, honoring, caring even when admitting he had just wanted to use her.
She kept her mouth shut though, she was not planning to risk anything here by her temper so she'd worse herself to keep restrain, it was good practice she supposed; should she ever gain a higher office or even with dealing with others when she eventually might retire and settle into her Countess title....ancestors she had nearly forgotten that...she smiled faintly to herself in her head, Countess...she wondered if Kryat knew about that title...heh...she was nobility. *Should have rubbed it in a few faces when I was with him…* she thought wryly *focus, Dai..* she instructed, forcing her mind back to the pair...she wasn't unarmed, her saber was on her, she just chose to keep it out of sight.

As the glistening armored Imperial Knight listened to the words of Malificere he was taking heed to the words extremely cautiously. Malificere could sense through the Force the man's unquestioned loyalty and disciplined attentiveness. Also, at that moment, Daiyu had caught a glimpse of the Imperial insignia engraved neatly in the tan stone floor beneath her. The symbols were neatly across the entire hallway. She knew she had fought under this banner so long, and one might wonder how two powerful forces had been divided so cleanly when they were almost exactly the same. Had it been the Force that divided them? Was Emperor Krayt wrong for opposing Roan Fel? These thoughts that could have been floating through her head were cut when the Imperial Knight spoke clearly.
"If you seek audience with our Lord Roan Fel, then we shall establish an honorable common ground. Please, bring your other Sith before us. We must establish basic protocol before standing in front of the Emperor. Forgive me in saying this, but we understand the Sith to be masters of deception. So at this moment, we must recognize you as an enemy under terms of diplomacy. Is that understood?"
The Imperial Knight exchanged glances with the uniformed Imperial, taking a moment to notice the colored tile rank on her chest of Commodore, and then back to the Sith Lord.

### **zerah** (2012-09-10 08:00:02)

Daiyu toed the simple with a faint frown, she'd never questioned it before...two sides apposing one another, one had different views and rules...clearly. But...the knight was handling things the same way most would in the Empire, they displayed the insignia proudly, they respected rank it seemed from his glance to her colors; subtle....were they not as different as she thought? that was a troubling idea, if they were the same then why....
She paused her thoughts, filing them away to ponder later and looked to the meditating half-man and nodded her head "we understand." she said before Alvar could, turning her gaze to the knight "we will respect that, though we come to you under the terms of peace and for the time being neutrality." She brushed a braid back "however meeting upon neutral ground would be beneficial for all of us I would think."
She then shifted her attention to the meditating Sith Lord, she wouldn't get close, she didn't want to take a chance that he was so deep in a trance that he might react before realizing it was her; instead she focused on the force and on him and sent him simply the message *'Wake'*

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-11 00:24:19)

The distinctive sound of approaching hard shoe footfalls were echoing throughout the hallway as two female Imperial Knights approached. It was Karnica Orcia and Kelos Sarrot. They presented a bow to the male Imperial Knight, and then he turned to Daiyu. "Forgive me for not introducing myself, I must have been so predisposed on protocol that this matter slipped my mind. My name is Rand Ko and it is a great pleasure to meet a fellow Imperial, even if we are on the terms of enemies. However, I must ask you to move away from the idea of neutral ground. You came here asking us for help, did you not? We will not overextend ourselves toward the fiercesome Sith. I hope it makes no difference to you that you stand before our Emperor in his audience chamber." 
The female knights looked toward Rand Ko and gave a slightly uneasy glance, but turned and smiled at Daiyu.

---

### **zerah** (2012-09-11 10:45:04)

Daiyu raised a brow, he had mentioned the notion of neutrality she was simply accepting the idea to be beneficial to all parties. Hm, typical, they truly weren't so different. She allowed a bow of her head in acceptance, she'd give no more than that in terms of respect or salutes, she was unsure where Imperial Knight fell in the grand scheme of things, she had been hard pressed just to kneel before Krayt, like hell she'd do more than she had to now.
"Of course it makes a difference." she said simply with a faint smirk "But we accept it as it is." she nods then at him as though waving off the indiscretion for forgetting manners "while protocol is important and more so to stick to ideals laid down so things in this unique circumstance do not get out of hand, it is…unfortunate that manners and the like seem to take a back seat, as it were…best be mindful to all part of protocol least something be forgotten that was far more important." She glanced Alvar than back to the knight and motioned to herself "Dayiu." she made no show or attempt to place her rank, she knew he knew it.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-12 01:07:53)

"Well, where would you prefer negotiations to take place? Are you the main ambassador for the Empire? Perhaps you feel this request as unfair to meet us on our terms? This is the leader of our entire Empire. You are going to meet him and discuss your wishes with him. Be thankful you've been allowed to come this far."
Rand Ko stated as he looked to the female Imperial Knights. He then frowned as he looked like he had something else on his mind, but waited momentarily for the two others in the grandiose hallways to respond.

---

### **wizard9660** (2012-09-12 14:14:02)

Terseht, or as he was called now, Invictus, walked down the hall with a stride bordering on elegant, walking with such purpose that it seemed as if he placed each foot in front of the other in exactly the spot he chose for a reason. He approached his two comrades, Daiyu and Alvar, having responded as quickly as he could to Daiyu's message. He stopped at the group just as Rand Ko began his rebuttal to Daiyu and Alvar
"Ambassador is an overinflated term given to those who speak with finesse and less personal opinions than most, but as it were I could be considered an ambassador if you like" he says with an air of decision, clearly feeling renewed and...something else, from his meditation. It was as if he had stumbled upon something greater than himself "I am known as Invictus or Terseht, and as thankful as my comrades and I are for the chance to meet with your emperor, it would be best not to forget that the reason we are here is that we both have something to gain from this agreement. One treats his guests with hostility and alienation only when he wishes them to become hostile in return, after all" he says, not exactly chastising the man for his choice of words but merely reminding him that they were not enemies as him and the rest of the empire were.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-12 19:01:20)

Rand Ko turned to face the second Sith Lord emerging from the room in which he conducted to his meditations. He listened to his words carefully and then gestured his hands, a sure sign of comfortable speechcraft. "Indeed we *might* have something to gain in tandem. But how can we trust servants of the Dark Side? What hostilities have we shown you? Do you consider a negotiation of terms hostile? We must resolve these differences before moving forward to see his highness."
Karnica Orcia looked at the Sith who claimed ambassador status. "We have every desire to move against Lord Krayt. However, you must earn our trust."

Invictus gestured towards himself "I take no personal offense from your words, however reminding anyone that their current position is due to an already appreciated privilege often makes people feel as if you are attempting to remind them you are superior to them" he states simply, pointing out that saying that he and his friends should be thankful they made it this far was largely unnecessary "Now I for one trust in the true emperor and believe that, were he in any danger, he would see it and we would make it no further. Let the force tell you whether or not we are trustworthy if our words do not persuade you"

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-14 03:22:23)

Rand Ko took a moment to observe the two Sith in front of him, his eyes noticeably observing Lord Malificere. *As this happens, the two Sith feel a trickle of the Force resonate coolly through their bodies. Rand was using the Force.* "While your words may bear some truth. I am sensing the Dark Side's powerful presence in that man. The Dark Side is notorious in our teachings of being deceptive and clouding judgment. The Sith are masters of deception themselves…is this not true?"
Kelos Sarrot leaned forward and whispered to Rand Ko, displaying a look of urgency upon her ivory features. Rand looked up from having his head tilted to listen and spoke. "Look, you have the Emperor's attention and he is awaiting us in the audience chamber. While I'd like to smooth these negotiations out for everyone's best interest…I'm afraid you'll have to surrender your weapons before proceeding into the chamber."
The Imperial Knights all looked over the three crew members. They seemed stoic and dutiful in every action they made, including their request.

---

### **zerah** (2012-09-14 12:32:36)

Daiyu frowned, crossing her arms over her chest, go unarmed into a room with many that are armed and told to expect to be treated as enemies...
right...anyone else sense a trap or was that just her mind being paranoid?
no..she was pretty sure that paranoia was valid. Even Krayt had allowed them to walk into his palace armed, he had no fear of them even attempting to kill him....
oh now *that* was an interesting thought....was Roan Fel *afraid* they might attack when this entire thing means court-marshal on their part? or worse their death? do they not understand that the three of them could have very well signed their own deaths the moment they return to Sith space?
Pompous, stoic, nerf-herding, ass.
then again...she was pretty sure she had the skill to keep her saber hidden from them. What she wanted to know though was if the other two planned to go along with this...this...scheme.
She glared at him, then glanced to the Sith beside her.

### **Maldoravia** (2012-09-15 07:16:20)

Maleficere was jarred from his thoughts at the mention of surrendering his weapon. A frown crossed his lips before handing over the saber that he had made himself, but held up Palpatine's with a firm grip just in case they tried to use the force to pry it from him. **I will give you the saber that I, Myself, made….but my Father's saber stays with me. You have my word, the word of one who shares your interest in deposing Krayt…that I will not attack unless provoked…also…does it truly matter if we hand over our weapons or not? We are Sith my friend…I can summon lightning at will. Shall I somehow turn over the force as well? This saber means a great deal to me…Sentimental as well as the love of my father. Even a stone cold Imperial would still keep at least -some- memento of their loved ones…"**
He gave him an honest look, and perhaps even one of the closest thing a prideful Sith could have of pleading. He had lost the holocron, temporarily but still lost it to a bastard, and he would not part with the only thing he had left of his father.

((A side note....I was not attacking....just persuasion which seemed to suck ass.))

### **Maldoravia** (2012-09-15 07:20:24)

Then added with a shrug, and placed teh saber with an open palm, albeit grudgingly. "However, -if- my words to not help you to understand…I will relinquish my heirloom for the sake of peace, but on the condition that I get it back promptly after the talks have ended. Or I -will- be very upset."

---

### **wizard9660** (2012-09-15 14:46:57)

Invictus takes a moment to wait for his companions to make their replies to the man before making his own response "You claim to show no hostilities toward us and yet you treat us as untrustworthy enemies. You already put as at a disadvantage in negotiations by treating us so, and removing our weapons serves no purpose other than to create a mutual feeling of distrust. The paranoid seldom carry out meaningful diplomacy." he states simply, making no move to remove his saber from his robe "I'm sure you can agree that any true ally of the force, whether light, or dark, needs no weapons. Not to quote someone that I'm sure you are no fan of, but even the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force. A lightsaber has no such power, so allowing us to keep them shouldn't be too much of a hassle." he states calmly, waiting for the man's response, reciprocating stoic for stoic.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-15 18:04:05)

The Imperial frowned slightly, slightly offended but maintained his dutiful demeanor. "Do not insult my intelligence. Please Sith. There have been many accounts of Force practitioners locked in a stalemate when going on the offensive with the Force. That is one reason lightsabers are used in combat. Have you never heard of the legend of Master Yoda and Darth Tyraanus unable to effect each other with their Force abilities, thus resorting to lightsabers? Now, I want to move forward. But for our Emperor's safety, please surrender your weapons. Do you really feel we are not being fair in our negotiations? Or should we discuss this on another date?"
The female Knights observed Rand Ko using his speechcraft, or to the Sith/Imperial, a lack of speechcraft. However, his point may be difficult to refute, many Force traditions use lightsabers when the Force fails to effect their attackers in any event. The ladies had a look on their face as to hope they knew what Rand Ko was doing, as they were dealing with dangerous Sith Lords.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-16 03:24:03)

Rand Ko let his arms drop to his sides, seemingly disappointed. Perhaps with himself, but who knew for sure? Either way the important protocol was not going well by his standards. This was what he thought as he replied to Lord Invictus."I see we are not reaching an agreement. We wish to have no weapons in our Emperor's audience chamber. But if you wish to keep them, I am willing to speak to our lord about the situation. Do not mistake me for someone who is not understanding of your position. Rather try to meet me somewhat on the concept of safety for our Emperor. I will go deliver this information to him personally."
He then turned to the Sith Lord Malificere and did what was considered a rare honor among Imperial Knights. He bowed his head to the man for relinquishing his weapon, attempting to show absolute gratification and honor among enemies for cooperating with him.
"I shall return shortly. Madame Kelos, please keep our guests comfortable."
While he was away, the two Imperial Knight ladies had two hooded servants present drinks that smelled pleasant and warm. Most likely a tea of some kind. The Imperial Knights seemed awkward with the Sith, unable to shake their vigilance to advance good will between their guests. So the offering of tea was a forced notion at best.
Then the noticeable footfalls of Rand Ko were heard as he approached the triumvirate of Sith and Imperial. He gestured towards the audience chamber.
"He has agreed to let you keep your weapons. So, if you wish, you may have your heirloom back."
He looked to the two ladies and they exchanged a glance of uneasiness. Rand Ko's surface thoughts did not like the Sith having one more tool of destruction at their disposal in front of their Emperor. But nevertheless he understood the urgency of the potential of defeating Krayt.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2012-09-16 08:59:57)

Maleficere looked to Rand Ko and was about to nod in understanding before the man bowed, and was a little bit floored. Sure he was a Sith Lord...but he had rarely had anyone bow to him....Oh if only Janelle were here...she would probably tell him not to let it go to his head. At the return of the man, he gave a nod as well as a look of thanks for allowing him to have the Lightsaber back. **"As a token of good faith, keep my other Saber until this is through."**  He then thought for a moment before handing the Electrum plated weapon to Daiyu, then turned back to Rand Ko. **"You say that Roan Fel is awaiting us? Normally I appreciate the concept of patience but the longer we tarry here the greater the odds that Krayt will sense or be aware of something amiss…Once the element of surprise is gone, this could get very difficult for all of us. However, I will not rush the Emperor."** He then looked around before searching his feelings to see if there was anything amiss about their hosts. He knew they would probably have done the same thing, but this was just something he felt that he had to do really quick.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-16 17:21:08)

The Imperial Knight, while mustering up a smile, gestured towards the end of the hallway. "If you would, this way please. To his Highness' reception chamber." The group begin moving in tandem down the dimly lit hallways of the Knight's temple that resembled fine, ancient Tapani architectural structures. About every ten feet you saw another larged circular engraved symbol of the Imperial insignia in stone. You came to a very sturdy Synthwood door as two guarding Knights flanked it. They rendered bows to Rand Ko, as he was obviously higher in statute amongst the Knights cadre. The guarding knights opened the Synthwood door to a circular hallway, with a large central pillar in the center. The pillar had many doors across it and was obviously an important area. Rand Ko came to a large set of double synthwood doors at the pillar's center and opened it.
Meanwhile, Malificere ran his thoughts through the Force like the Great Falls of Naboo. The entire temple was luminating with the power of the Force, and they had the general sensation of caution towards the Dark Side. The Dark Side was pushing against their power of the Force, and he had begun to understand their apprehension. But they were tolerating this Dark presence at the aspect of defeating Darth Krayt. He had the feeling things were not going well right now, and if they continued down their current path negotiations would not go well.
The double doors opened to the large audience chamber. On the walls were elegant tapestries of Imperial insignias, they were velvet and gold in appearance. The room was very vibrant with colors and the stone here was almost a bronze sheen it was so new and well-kept. About fifteen front of you, you saw a collection of Imperial Knights sitting across a finely polished Synthwood table, and rare gems were decorated across it's entire construction. Past the table, totaling about 30 feet, was an ascension of stairs and red carpet to a finely crafted golden throne in which a singular figure sat. The Imperial Knights lift their gauntleted red hands in reception of the Sith Lords, and stood in a parade fashion at the entrance of the guests.
Behind him was a stained glass window of a multitude of colors, mostly gold, red, and blue. The stained glass window depicted Imperial Knights all holding their lightsabers in defense of the Imperial insignia above their heads.
In the throne, was no mistaking that it was Emperor Roan Fel. The human had weathered features but was aging quite well. He had black hair with a grey portion of it on top of his head in straight and neat pattern. He wore a polished silver breast plate similar to the other Imperial Knights, only much more elevated in terms of decoration. The rest of his outfit had gold shoulder pads with a gold neck piece that definitely cemented his position of royalty. The tunic he wore was richly lavender in appearance with a purple cloak. He remained in his throne and gestured out to the Sith Lords who were across the Imperial Knights table at the entrance of the room. The Emperor spoke in a commanding voice. "I hear that our opening negotiations were not to your liking." He betrayed a smile despite trying to remain professional.

### **zerah** (2012-09-17 15:58:59)

Daiyu watched with a frown as Alvar handed over his saber, she didn't approve but the seemingly relief on the knight was...a good start she supposed; it did show a bit that he was trying to protect his lord and not attempt to kill them while they were unarmed at least.
The tea that was offered was refused on her part with a raised hand and a small shake of her head; the gesture was appreciated but she didn't trust them not to poison it. Thankfully awkwardness didn't have much time to set in before they were ushered to the throne room; Daiyu taking the saber of old and stashing it when she deemed it safe to do so without being seen of where on her person she hid it, it wouldn't do for them to know where that is, let alone where her own was.
The throne room....
oh by the ancestors could it *get* any more gaudy? honestly, she didn't care if he was Emperor on this side there had to be some law against so much....shine. And she loved shiny, but this...ugh. and the purple? yes it looked good on him but really now, he was just showing off. She couldn't help that her mind supplied an image of Kryat and his throne room beside the one she was viewing. Honestly she couldn't say she liked either one better but there had to be a middle ground somewhere...did they both think people would forget who they were if they didn't have such grandeur?
Men. Honestly.
She kept her mouth shut though, walked behind the two Sith as was...well proper for an imperial vs a Sith on their side of things, more so with who one of them was, they didn't need to know that she, metaphorically speaking, had one of them on a leash.
tch...not to liking. really did he expect it to go so smoothly that they'd walk in unarmed with no fuss? Even Krayt hadn't thought that.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-18 01:39:35)

The Emperor rubbed his rough chin with a curious look. A look that Malificere and Invictus knew all too well. He was using the Force. Roan Fel reached out with the Force and felt into Daiyu's surface thoughts. He smiled and spoke in his commanding tone that echoed throughout the audience chamber. "An interesting trio. You come to topple Darth Krayt, yet this woman has thoughts for him. Do ye esteemed Lords not know of this?"
The Imperial Knights looked at the woman curiously, and Rand Ko stepped away from the trio of Sith Imperials and observed them carefully. The Knights were speaking softly at their ceremonial table, awaiting an answer from Invictus and Malificere.

---

### **wizard9660** (2012-09-18 17:18:30)

Invictus looked slightly amused at this, turning toward Daiyu with an eyebrow raised before facing the dark lord again. "Quite often one will develop feelings for one they are forced to stay with as a means to make their own situation more tolerable, more often than not it is involuntary. She was forced to spend time with Krayt while he attempted to portray kindness to win her over. Her feelings are a side effect of Krayt's attempted brainwashing and have no legitimacy" he says, hoping the explanation would do for now. He turned toward Malificere and Daiyu to see if they had anything to add on the matter.

---

### **zerah** (2012-09-18 20:16:57)

Daiyu did not blush. It was a credit to sheer willpower that she didn't blush.
She did slap a hand to her face and mutter something about the damn force, but she didn't blush.
And she would have to buy the metal man a drink or his choice of upgrades after this because that was the smoothest thing she'd ever heard about her thoughts on Krayt.
She raised her head briefly and nodded with a faint tight grin "Two years..." she amends, but didn't say more. Really he didn't need to know how nice he'd been to her, how sweet and kind and even apologetic in a way when admitting he was trying to use her but could learn to love her like she could learn if she took a place at his side.
Ah hell and that was that syndrome thing she'd read about, when those captured get attached to those that took them, dammit why hadn't she seen that?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-18 21:33:28)

The Emperor shifted in his throne thoughtfully, and then spoke once again to the group standing in the large open archway."Ah, the masterful and deceptive Sith technique of Dun Moch. You two must be very versed in this Dark Art. The Sith use it to play on a person's insecurities to give them a sense of empowerment. As Imperial Knights, we never underestimate the power of the Dark Side. That must be the 'brainwashing' you spoke of. Although I would venture to say it's more than that, it is a form of Force manipulation itself…the Dark Side. She has thoughts for him, and I sense the Dark energies in you and your friend. You would not surrender your weapons, save for one Sith. It seems you are all very divided on this whole issue, and that does not bode well. I am eager to overthrow Lord Krayt… but you must earn our trust before moving forward."

---

### **wizard9660** (2012-09-18 22:21:48)

Invictus smiled "Trust is not a life ring to throw to someone who is drowning but rather more akin to the handshake that is a symbol for trust. It just be reciprocated by both parties or it is an empty gesture that exposes someone. We came her in trust, not only trusting that that this was not a trap but trusting you to hear us out without bias. So far your knights have made it abundantly clear they have no intention of trusting an imperial officer and two sith, despite the fact that we have escorted two of your knights unharmed. We came into a situation where we are outnumbered by far and committing treason to the empire. Does this not show trust?"

---

"It shows trust. You are right. At this moment, I recognize the woman's thoughts on Lord Krayt. I also appreciate the Sith Lord's willingness to cooperate by forfeiting his weapon. But let us forget this troublesome protocol." The Emperor said as he gestured to Rand Ko, whom ushered the trio to the ceremonial stone Imperial Knight table. There were an abundant amount of chairs left, representing that some of the council members were empty. There were chalices strewn about the table and exotic Nubian glimmering candles to highlight the faces of the Knights. They watched all of you with a bit of a cautious air, but not too troubled.
The Emperor waited for them to be situated then leaned back in his throne. "Tell us, how might the Imperial Knights serve the Sith?"

Maleficere had simply remained silent through all of this. He had no doubt in his mind that Daiyu loved him more than Krayt...she had said no to his marriage proposal but said to Maleficere to do it right next time...That was all he needed on that subject.
At the question that Fel posed to the group he then tilted his head **"We do not wish you to serve us, though I understand your meaning. Let us put aside notions that you will be serving us during this troubling time."** He then looked around at the table before taking his seat first of the three, showing that above all he was the leader of this group. **"My dear fellow Imperials. We knew this day would be coming, where the time of Krayt's destruction would be at hand. This is by no means an easy task as his corruption goes further than ANY of you could imagine…"** He turned to Roan Fel and nodded politely **"No offense to the great Emperor…but I doubt even you, your highness can fully understand the foul practices that he carries out."** He rubbed the back of his neck with a frown before addressing the group as a whole once again. **"Let us think back to a more simpler time, a more…practical time. The late Lord Palpatine had the right idea my friends, he simply only chose one side of the coin though he could have taken two. I have, in my possession…something that would make even Krayt either weep with joy or cower in fear…and I now invite all present to hear what this is. My friends, it is knowledge. Such a weapon can turn the tide of any war and I say this to you now, so to not hide anything…This knowledge deals with plans for a THIRD Death Star. The Death Star is one thing that Palpatine knew could be used to the Empire's advantage. It's devastating power is nigh unmatchable. the only problem with the first was that damned exhaust port. We however, have the plans that can gain us that boon provided we leave off any ports that a force user could target. It will involve using the Star Forges…Yes, there are two. It will most likely also involve my holocron…which Krayt has unfortunately, stolen as it were. But before we go into any more details…If any assembled here wish to speak up or back out…I suggest you do this now. After we start the planning, there is no going back. We must be committed, we MUST be resolved and our beliefs must be iron clad. Does ANYONE here…wish to not go any further…?"** 
(Speach Check, 22 + a DP. We cannot afford this meeting to go wrong so I am not pulling this punch. THIS IS IMPORTANT: This Check is meant to weed out any person who is afraid, and those who are NOT to be persuaded into being on board...Fel included.)

Daiyu took her seat just after Alvar, it had no purpose of some air or what not on her position, they both knew their roles in things now...well, she knew, he still had to do things properly. Still she let him speak, leaning back in her chair and attempting to be relaxed when she was highly tense. She kept herself running through a breathing exercise as he spoke, letting her mind calm and keep from thoughts of Krayt to better help herself.
Force manipulation though...that was a new idea, had he really done that to her? bastard. She'd have to kick him. Hard. In the groin. With a saber. heh...that was a pleasant thought. No keep thoughts on the meeting, he's speaking rather well, then again he was always able to do that; it was how he won over the crew before and....wait what?
She backed up his words a bit to hear them again in her head, she didn't let a trace of emotion show, by sheer iron will; she did, however, kick him in the shin. She let no thoughts escape her, mind blank, she was not going to give up more emotional thoughts.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-19 19:07:35)

The Imperial Knight Council could not believe their ears as they heard the Sith proclaim the idea of a third Death Star. Such words as outrageous and radical were thrown about as they barely managed to keep their composure. Rand Ko was among the ones who didn't believe what he heard, and his eyes were now watching Invictus as he knew everyone was watching Malificere. The Emperor responded with almost a laugh, "A Third Death Star? Just a moment, before we discuss that…what are these Star Forges you speak of?"
*I need your roll for the persuasion check.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-19 19:29:44)

After the debating among the Imperial Knights continued, one brave soul stood and addressed the Emperor awaiting his response to the Star Forge. She had gold eyes, red hair, and striking beauty as her hair was neatly cropped in a puffy fashion that was quite becoming. "Greetings Imperials, I am Azlyn Rae. I have fought many times against the Sith Empire. You can see the scars of battle across my face. If it's one concept I understand now, it is the unrelenting power of the Sith." She turned from the trio and then faced the Emperor. "My Lord, perhaps we should move toward this idea of a Superweapon. We could destroy the Sith permanently, wipe out any trace of their existence. You believe in the power of our Order…but not tyranny. Recently 1/10th of the Mon Calamari species was erased from existence because of Darth Krayt. We need overwhelming power to stop the Sith, that is the one ideal they respect. Power."
Rand Ko stood up from his chair, almost at a loss for words at was unfolding before his eyes. "They respect power, but do we let Sith into our ranks to destroy another Sith?" Another Imperial suggested that the Sith could take over their Empire from the top down, and never trust the Dark Side. Then the Emperor spoke. "I cannot believe the impact of the words this man speaks. He even has my own Council questioning me." The Emperor was clearly shook up as the Council was beginning to go with the idea of lending aid to the Sith, and what a Superweapon would do to aid their effort in the war.
An Imperial Knight spoke out, declaring Krayt's power and that soon if the Dark Side continues to grow the Knight's order will be wiped out if their not careful. He made a glaring point if the Sith were extinguished from the galaxy then it's worth any price to pay. The idea of having two Sith aligned with the Imperial Knights hurts nothing in the grand scheme. The Emperor saw his Knights in awe at Malificere and couldn't believe this. His thoughts were now solely focused on diplomacy, and doing what's right for the Order of the galaxy.
The trio looked at this uncertainty in the council, perhaps having their own chance to intervene in the debate.

Maleficere did not smile outward, nor inwardly. This was an important time that demanded professionalism. He did however feel and wince at the kick to his shin but quickly ignored it as he watched the result of his plea for help. He did, however, address one issue before starting on the rest. **Let me come and say this right now…as it has been brought up a number of times without clarification on my end. I…have had training in the Dark Side, that is undeniable. Some of it I rather enjoyed, most of it in fact with the exception of one or two instances that caused me unimaginable pain and suffering. As a matter of personal belief however, It is my understanding and belief that both sides of the Force must be utilized. One cannot be without the other. Both sides are equally powerful, but when united an individual can become near on god-like if trained for long enough. We are not so different, this company in this room. I do not share the narrow mindedness of true Sith such as Krayt, rather I seek to reach my own understanding of the Force and can only do so after Krayt is demolished. It is one of many reasons why Krayt needs to go. With the Sith not in check, there will not be true peace…but terror reigned on Imperial, Rebel, and others alike. The madness must stop, Ladies and Gentlemen."**
He then turned to Roan Fel and bowed his head in apology **Your Highness I did not mean to bring about such chaos in this meeting however…I said what I believe needed to be said. The fact of the matter remains, the Death Star can provide that overwhelming support that is needed. The key is the Star Forges…It has been told to me that they are the key in building this Death Star, in record time apparently. There is…a few notions of concern however, but I am sure that we can iron those out here."**
Looking back to the table group. **"The Forges, are stations themselves. They come from the Rakatans…If you know who those are?"**

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-19 23:12:12)

The Emperor frowned at this statement. "You speak of learning the Unifying Force? I know little about it, except that the lure of the Dark Side can draw you back if you still call upon its power. However, there are not many people who practiced such an art. Its knowledge and texts might be here and there."
At the table the Knights looked at each other, and one of them responded. "They are extinct. How can you be in possession of such technology?" Rand Ko heard this and stood up. "Nonsense, extinct species, long forgotten Space stations, Death Stars? This is some kind of Sith trickery….Dun Moch."
Azlyn Rae responded to dismiss Rand with a wave of her hand."Let go of your cautious mind Brother Knight, it does you credit. But search your feelings, there is some truth to the Sith's words."
Rand Ko shook his hand furiously... "Nonsense, I won't be lured into the Dark Side with this lure of power and….". "SILENCE! Sir Rand, calm yourself. Let us listen to their words and keep a keen mind on the Force. The Dark Side is prevalent. But only a calm mind and a person with the Force flowing through him will be able to determine a solution here." The Emperor said after silencing the chamber...he then looked to Darth Malificere.
"And just what stage of the Death Star's construction are you currently at?"

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-21 15:51:56)

The Emperor could nigh believe his ears, he waved his hand in a dismissing manner at the hushed roar of the Council table. "The destruction of Korriban….Coruscant?!?! You expect us to help you accomplish such a goal? Destroying the Galactic Capital of the Galaxy? The heart of the Galaxy's infrastructure would topple. Trade lanes would vanish, there would be a tremendous deficit in the economic pool. Not to mention the tremendous cost of life. An estimated 1 trillion killed on one planet. You would lose more than you would gain with such a radical maneuver. The only such event in the galaxy that caused that much death was the Yuuzhan Vong War with 3 trillion lives lost."
He looked about the Knight Council to see if they were so keen on the trio's proposed plan of action against Darth Krayt and for the proposed creation of the Third Death Star. They seemed to be quieting down at Emperor Fel's counter-point. Or rather yet, at Darth Malificere's plan of action with the Death Star. The trio was losing momentum in this hearing...you didn't need the Force to know that.
"I pose this question. Do you even have the blueprints of the Death Star in your possession?"
The Council probably knew where this was going. The Force was telling the two Sith that now the Emperor was trying to assess just how big of a threat the two Sith were, regardless of whose allegiance they pledged themselves to. Careful speechcraft was now needed to proceed...even more so than before.

### **Maldoravia** (2012-09-22 08:16:14)

**"Coruscant is too important, I acknowledge that now. But Korriban will be unprotected! The Sith would never expect an attack on their home planet! One shot from the Death Star can destroy planets, you know this your highness. Once it comes out of hyperspace after construction, and puts Korriban in it's sight…they would be able to evacuate maybe two shuttles from any landing pads they have before it is obliterated. You are aware of how much the Sith cause chaos and unrest, this would be a major blow to them! Sure maybe a couple thousand would escape but thats only a couple next to thousands upon thousands upon thousands. Surely you must see the value of what I am saying…yes? If Korriban is out of your mighty grasp your highness then please…tell us now."**
That was certainly more than he had meant to say but...what could he say, he liked to talk. At the question of the blueprints he gave a smug nod. "**As If I would propose this without them…? I understand that I must come across as insane or crazy, but I gained the respect from my words alone from my crew as Admiral. I was the top in training on Bastion in my group…Right out of the Academy I was made Admiral. How many do you know that can boast such a claim? Surely there are a few but I am part of that Elite few. I digress, the point of the matter is this. The Sith must be wiped out to ensure Galactic peace…We will also need help from the Jedi. their crusade to wipe out the Sith coexists with ours now, however small their numbers may be. All I am asking your highness, is to put faith and trust in the most powerful ally you have right now. It may be difficult to come to terms with but as of right now, we are this Empire's only hope of survival. The true Galactic Empire must survive by any means necessary…and I am begging you to not let this chance slip through your mighty and just hands.**

Daiyu clears her throat, and shoots Alvar a faint glare for not even attempting to get them in on his plan, she did not like being put off kilter like this.
"Coruscant is far too important it's true, never would any death star be pointed at it." the glare intensified before she finally turned away from him to look around the room "There would be no point to it, after all a well placed shot to the head…or his back…" She glanced meaningfully to the pair flanking her "would be more than enough to unseat Krayt. However."
She took a moment to look around the room again "Krayt sent a message to the galaxy by exterminating the Mon Calamari, destroying the Sith home world would be just retribution in the race's name as well as hitting the Sith where it hurts most." She motioned to Alvar "And he makes an excellent point that they would not be expecting such a thing to ever happen."
She drew a breath, she hated speaking in front of others, she didn't think she had the gift as much as the two with her "We understand this is very…difficult to believe, really. we do understand. But this needs to happen, a weapon to be used now and maybe even a safe haven for those races in need of relocation, think about it for a moment…think of how this could turn the war in favor of the one true Emperor."

The Imperial Knights listened intently as Malificere explained his situation. He could sense their respect for his position of Admiral as he told them of his prior achievements. The notion of Korriban being destroyed was being considered by the Imperial Knights after he finished speaking and then Azyln Rae rose to speak her behalf. "My liege, he brings a good point. Korriban would be a highly symbolic and detrimental attack to the Sith war effort. Their tomes and knowledge would be lost forever. It could theoretically cripple the Dark Side as that planet has been a boon for Dark Side energies." Rand Ko saw this and offered a retort. "Do you think any of us has the right to manipulate the Force that drastically? Such an action would be on a magnitude of the Old Republic age, such as the Battle of Ruusaan. The Dark Side *nearly* eliminated in full, and they retaliated after a millennium. Let's not forget our most basic principles. We are an Empire of Order through Strength, while using the Death Star would be a decisive action against our enemies…it could be construed as tyrannical…especially by the Jedi and the Alliance. And are these practitioners of the Dark Side ready to pay that price of losing Korriban? The destruction of all Sith? They themselves must renounce the Dark Side. Then we must eliminate all Sith, which will be a very daunting task."
The Emperor was aware of this, but frowned anyway at the reminder. "We mustn't rule through tyranny that much is true. But could the elimination of such an evil location be considered tyrannical? Or rather a necessary act of war? The Death Star could send the Sith into hiding…but may return stronger at another time."
As the negotiations continued, Daiyu began speaking to the Imperial Knights. Her points were visually making the impact like Malificere's, and they quickly garnered respect for her. Around the point she delivered the importance of the Superweapon, the Sith could visually see the respect for Daiyu in their eyes. The Death Star didn't appear to be such a horrible idea in the way it was intended to be used.
It was obvious now that Daiyu was representing the Empire as the Knights knew it, keeping her shoulders broad as she spoke her behalf. They could definitely relate more to her than the Sith. Rand Ko once again voiced his perspective. His ideas were beginning to shift as he spoke calmly. "If we want to maintain the image of Order the Death Star must take careful planning before its use. This all might take some time. However, we can conclude the Death Star's use could prove to be invaluable to our efforts. Even if our image does change a bit, it would damage the Sith greatly."
The Emperor nodded at his statement and motioned for his next statement on his throne. "My honored emissaries. If we're to continue our negotiations and a possible future together…do you wish to put aside the notion of the Death Star for now? Could we move toward the idea of eliminating Krayt? Or were you planning to use the Death Star for that?"

---

### **Maldoravia** (2012-09-22 21:34:17)

Maleficere looked to Daiyu with a polite nod at her well chosen, as well as spoken, words. She was truly an asset to this meeting and if not for her, the meeting would mots likely have ended where it stood. He then now cleared his throat before saying simply **"I believe that we are mostly in agreement about the Death Star for now, and since he is on Coruscant, using the Death Star to take him out with it is not an option. I am interested though…"** He leaned back in his chair and looked to everyone **"I am interested to see just how any of you would consider deposing him. My companions and I do not even know where to begi-"** He stopped mid sentence before looking to Daiyu. This was perfect. Krayt, through his own blinding hate for Maleficere...handed him the perfect tool to his demise. **"Daiyu….You spent two years with Krayt while he tried to woo you away from me…You must have learned something from him that can help us with this…correct?"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-22 22:37:27)

The Emperor's attentiveness peaked. He spoke with an air of disbelief. **"Two years with Lord Krayt?"** Rand Ko metaphorically jumped at the glaring point that Darth Malificere had made. **"My lord, surely you realize, anything she knows about the Sith Lord has great intelligence value. Even if we gain nothing else from the emissaries and this negotiation…."** Azlyn Rae gestured for Rand Ko to settle down. As Rand Ko was a bit on the pugnacious side with his many battles with the Sith. Rand Ko regained his composure and spoke calmly. **"Surely anything you can tell us about this man would be of great value to us. We'd greatly appreciate your cooperation. If you reveal this to us, and the intelligence is proven fact…our trust with you will be irrefutable."**
The Council was now in awe at the unexpected notion of espionage that Daiyu had executed, and they eagerly awaited answers. Lord Krayt had no love for Fel's Empire, but most of all, he wanted Fel himself dead...as if it was completely personal and fueled by the Dark Side. What the trio offered to the Imperial Knights seem wondrous, and perhaps ever so slightly bordering on too good to be true.

---

### **zerah** (2012-09-23 22:08:25)

Daiyu rubbed a hand over her eyes, damn man...she had been hoping deep down to keep most of what she knew to herself. He may have manipulated her but he spoke to her in confidence, she was fairly certain she knew somethings that even his favorite pet Sith didn't know.
And deep down....she was still hoping to convince him to step down and leave to live in peace. She wanted that for him just as much as she wanted to put a blade through his chest. Maybe she could....only reveal some things...leave the more personal parts to her own mind. She was loyal to the true Emperor but...he had been her friend for those two years; and her heart twisted still at the notion of his death, ugh...she was going to slap that man.
She looked over the group, and the eyes and ears waiting and sighed, she wasn't going to get out of it completely. Alright...just a few things.
"He….he doesn't view himself as a user of the dark side but that he is the dark side personified…and his armor gives him strength." she says the last quickly and leans back in her chair, schooling her features to be carefully blank and attempt to loosen the tenseness in her hands as she crosses her arms. The rest was...private. She was even trying her best to stomp down the memories that were trying to come up; like when he gave her the flower...or when she found him mediating...
She looked down to the table then, the memories were..painful, she missed him, and she didn't know if that was real or...manipulated.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-24 04:08:13)

Rand Ko, now becoming the leading voice among the finely decorated Council stone-table shifted his hands flat against the surface and spoke softly. "Apologies for this Commodore. But we are strong in the Force. Our entire Council can see your thoughts. Maybe not as clear as we should, but we can feel them out. You are hiding something." Azlyn Rae waved her hand to calm down Rand as he stated the obvious to the Imperial Knights. "Then there is no need to push our Imperial comrade. If she has feelings on the subject, she will do or say what she believes is right." Rand Ko heard this counter point and looked toward the Emperor, very focused on the proceedings.
The Emperor nodded for Rand Ko and it was clear the Emperor awaited for Daiyu to respond what had just been said. Whether she should tell all that she knew, or rather do what she felt, however she interpreted to do that.

---

### **zerah** (2012-09-24 07:55:10)

Daiyu shifted uncomfortably, she was starting to hate the force. Of all of them though, she was thankful that at least one of the knights understood that this was....a delicate subject. The others though...
She sighed and glanced to the man at the head of the table then back to the table itself. Alvar would want her to speak everything she knew, Invictus too she was sure; Krayt would have asked her to if they were at his table instead...what her father do? Probably wouldn't be in this situation to begin with, but if he were?
*Find the light…* that what he had told her.
She sighed again, closing her eyes to gather herself, for him....she'd say some of what she didn't want to for him. Light won't be able to be found so long as the Sith control even part of the galaxy.
"He has Vong implants.." she starts softly "it lives on his spine, yes…it lives…he….he complained about it often; the trouble of it, the benefit of it, the annoyance that it served." She smiled faintly at a memory "he asked me once if it bothered me. The idea or the sight.." 
She shifts again, not willing to look at anyone, this was so painful...he was going to use her so why does it feel like betrayal...damn him for making her like him.
"He meditates when he has those thoughts, helps to recenter himself…maybe helps to bring the thing to his side of seeing things I don't know, but he does."  She quiets again thinking, nervously nibbling at her lower lip and toying with the beaded braid that matched his colors...the braid she made to represent him.
Should she tell them about his offer? why he kept asking? why she had considered it? Was it important enough?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-24 17:16:19)

The Emperor leaned forth at the revelations made by Commodore Daiyu. He made sure to speak before anyone else, most notably Rand Ko....he meant well, but he was hurting negotiations with the Sith whom see to be at least revealing truthful information. **"Yuuzhan Vong implants you say? It grants him some benefit? The Yuuzhan Vong had such technologies to be able to repel the Force. That's what made them so dangerous in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of 20 ABY."** He then reflected a moment, taking a moment to run a hand across his weathered facial features to regain his composure. **"I know how troubling this may be, are you sure you wish to go forward with this? While we want to defeat Lord Krayt. We don't want to lose who we are by being vicious like the Dark Side. If you care for someone…don't go any further.**"
Even the other Knights on the Council couldn't believe what they were hearing. This was there chance to retrieve critical intelligence. Why hold back? But they understood to a degree, don't use the ruthlessness of the Dark Side when she saw something in Darth Krayt. But, did she see something good in Darth Krayt? It was true at least, that sometimes the philosophies of the Force had caused inaction in the past. Commodore Daiyu knew this of her early studies in the Yinchorri Temple. The Force induces such a meditative and thoughtful state that it causes inaction.

### **Maldoravia** (2012-09-26 13:41:31)

Maleficere sat there and listened though felt his head snap to the Emperor, then looked to Daiyu and finally stood up to stretch his back for a moment before sitting back down as he spoke to Daiyu, regardless of who was around now. **"He knew I asked you to marry me Daiyu…he knows I love you, and that you feel the same for me. He wants to -use- your love…such a sacred emotion, to cause hurt and pain to me as well as you. Don't be taken in by his lies…I…"** He looked down now at the table and said in a whisper **"Being without you in my life would be even worse than what we went through…all of it. Please…put him behind -us- so we can move on with our own lives and be happy together…"**

---

### **zerah** (2012-09-26 17:32:33)

Daiyu sighed softly "it's still personal, for all that he's done and all that he wanted to do he was still nice to me." she said softly to him "He listened to me, let me argue and conceded if my point was better."  hell he was making her say it all anyway wasn't he? damn man...men...manipulating men, all of them, Tt.
"He asked me to marry him." she finally admitted "asked me a few times over my two years with him and again recently, leaving the question open for answer at any time." she motioned to Alvar "I know that he was asking to get to him, to use me to secure an heir, he even admitted all of that but…"
She lets her thoughts wander to his argument to her question of 'why me?' "He wanted someone at his side who could speak as a neutral party, one that didn't have the force to guide them one way or another but let their own thoughts guide them…he wanted me to be at his side, to argue against him for the betterment of everyone; to keep him in check I suppose…he…he wanted a counter part.."
She looked to the table, she didn't want to look to the pair beside her for this "he never really considered either of you his apprentices…you were minions…but I…I think you were stronger than he anticipated, he always came back worried."
Quietly she added "I chose you, but I could have chosen him easily Alvar…I like him still, and I feel terrible for betraying what I've learned of him. For all that he wanted, he was still my friend, and someone that cared about me and I him. Don't…don't belittle that as though it means nothing now. That entire experience changed me as much as it did you, I won't forget him…" She fiddled with the colored beaded braid, she never did tell either Alvar nor Krayt what it represented, though she believed Krayt knew. She looked up to the table "In the end, for all that he may have done, he should be given the choice to step down and walk away." She'd give him that chance, she felt as though she owed him that.

### **Maldoravia** (2012-09-26 18:16:13)

Maleficere wanted to pound his fist into the table, he didnt care if Fel saw or felt the anger and anguish that was inside him...In fact he wanted him to see. At least one person to acknowledge how he felt would make him feel all the more better for it. **Just because he was nice to you Dai does not mean he should be given any sort of chance. I could care less whether he viewed me as an apprentice or minion. But at least I can rest knowing I foiled his plan about you. I already helped you awaken to the Force….that was me….not him. I will be damned before I let him succeed in anything he does. As for this notion of giving him a choice?! It cannot be done. Not until the pieces are in play without his knowledge…and without you anywhere near him. I will not allow him to have any more chances to poison your mind…or give him a chance to use you as a mere bargaining chip. If it came to you or his own life Dai..he would chose himself and cast you into harms way if it would save him. Whether you believe this or not, it is true. If he indeed cared about you then he would have listened when you begged him to not give us those damned implants!"**
He calmed himself after a few moments before looking to Roan Fel with a pleading look. **"Your highness…If you indulge her request to give that monster a choice I beg you to add this as a condition. Only once the Death Star is completed and war-capable…will you allow the choice to be given to him to step down. If it is given too early he will suspect everything…and we will all be dead men and women."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-09-27 00:52:01)

The Emperor frowned at the Sith-Imperials as they had an active dispute in front of all the Imperial Knights to behold. Before the others could say anything regarding the matter, they simply waited for the Emperor to speak as he adjusted his finely cut jewelery around his neck. **"This is quite unnerving. You come before us in solidarity to dethrone Darth Krayt by means of assassination and that is what we initially agreed on. Nonetheless, your esprit de corps seems to be lacking, and if we're going to surprise Lord Krayt we will need all of you for maximum efficiency."**
The Emperor looked to the Knight scribe who was detailing the notes of the proceedings on a flimisplast. "**Knight Iksen, let it be known that official negotiations have begun with the Sith-Imperial defectees. However, in the interest of the Sith not being able to trace the evidence of this occurence, I would like the holocam feeds deleted immediately. Furthermore, I want only Knight Iksen documenting the following hearing. All documentation will now be passed to Knight Iksen now. That goes for the Sith as well."**
He rose from his throne for the first time and opened his arms. The light of the stained Imperial Knight glass cascading across his royal figure. "You, the Sith triumvirate. You come before us to destroy Lord Krayt do you not? Convince us that you are sincere in killing him. Now that the Commodore has revealed her feelings, I want every Sith's input on the matter. Please understand that asking Darth Krayt to step down will not be enough. He is too dangerous to live. The Sith thrive on the ability to regroup and counterattack ferociously. If he simply is incarcerated he will escape, and return with fury."
*Skill Challenge has begun. Every player must interact. The first skill check in the challenge is a Persuasion check, convincing The Council of your plan to kill Krayt, or to not do so. Any of you may make a Knowledge Bureaucracy check as a reaction in addition to the persuasion.*

The cascading sunlight of Ravelin City pierced through the stained glass, as Roan Fel began slowly descending down the stone steps to the Knight Council table. The Knights look suddenly alarmed, as a tactical mind would dictate for their leader to not get close to the Sith...but he did so anyways. He walked behind each Sith, and stopped behind Daiyu. She felt his breath, and his presence in the Force. He was a decent man...that much she could feel. His voice my send a slight shiver up her spine as he continued to read her thoughts. **"Why is everyone so silent…? Commodore? You come here showing great potential to our war effort…and now silence? Words can escape the most cunning tongues it seems."**
*((Daiyu's Bureaucracy check failed. I PM'ed Invictus' bureaucracy results. Remember, you can make a persuasion here if you wish, but it must be roleplayed out. The idea is to convince Roan Fel to kill Krayt and how to do so.))*

Daiyu straightened in her seat, shoulders tense and back so straight it looked like it had to hurt; she kept her face neutral but every fiber in her being was on high alert; she didn't like people behind her, she didn't like not being able to see them, she wasn't confident enough with her own use of the force to feel as though she had fair ground and that made her nervous and cautious and *dear ancestors get him away from her back* it was a panicked thought that floated out before she could stop it, promptly throttling it and shoving it down.
She could feel from him enough to know that he was just, and he was everything Krayt wasn't, which was...sad...and it made her realize just how...how sad her situation was. She had let Krayt at her back many times without a thought, and here was this man who was just and truthful and spoke wisdom and too listened to them all, who went against what his knights wished and yes she could see how anxious they were at his own movements, but here he was...a better man than Krayt and he made her tense.
That bastard had really done a number on her head...on her emotions...they had all said it but here it was, the proof of it all, her crew could get at her back and she'd be fine but this man? these knights? the ones that wanted the Empire back to the glory it was before that...that...bastard?
son of a...
Her gaze darkened as her thoughts rolled in her head, low and under the surface, her body was still tense, she would have to work on that later, but her face hardened. How many people had he done this to? She wondered then, how many other women he had done it too..had she been the first or was she the second? fourth? thirteenth? She'd never asked him that...why hadn't she asked him that? He knew her heritage but was ready to kill her as it was before his...his...plan, so how many women?
How many had he killed for saying no? or ruined and left in the undercity?
She wondered if anyone else could feel the rage that she could feel boiling from her center, the murderous intent, she had had a wonderful relationship with Alvar before he had opened his damn mouth and doomed them, she had held to his thought throughout her two years and the moment anything the countered the Krayt she'd known came up she'd defend him....she was a pawn...he'd made her into a pawn. The thought made her blood boil, she knew her father had told her to find the light but there was no light in a man that messed her with mind, turned her into a pawn, and than continued to think well on him.
Her face darkened suddenly, looking off to a point beyond, seeing him...on his throne, smirking at what he's done and just waiting for her to go back to him.
"Kill him." she said finally, darkly.
Screw mercy.
And then...the corners of her mouth slowly turned up in what could only be a smirk...or a demented sort of smile that made the skin crawl "And do it slowly by torturing the implant in his back."
She knew revenge wasn't part of the light, her father would be cross...but if he knew, if he knew what that bastard had done...she liked to think he'd take the torture for himself to do for his daughter's honor. Her mother would do it, in a heartbeat, and so would she.

Rand Ko studied Daiyu's gestures and thoughts carefully as she made her plea. He spoke on her behalf, which was odd as he was the most defensive of the Imperial Knights since walking into the chamber. **"My lord, her thoughts are still conflicted…but I sense the resolve in her. Even if she does not fully commit to the death of Lord Krayt, she should put us in position were it's worth the risk on either hand."** Azyln Rae concluded with this notion, as Daiyu was not powerful with the Force and she wouldn't be strong enough to stop the Imperial Knights once all elements were in place for the assassination. The Emperor turned to Daiyu, with a compassionate and knowing gaze that he understood what she was asking for. The Emperor spoke, showing his compassion and courage as a leader. **"The Sith have a hold on your mind. But I understand your resolve. Lord Krayt has been consumed by the Dark Side. It is unfortunate he must be slain as those who fall victim to the Dark Side are lost. They go through great suffering and he has made you understand his pain. But we will be strong. But can your comrades stand in your place? I wish to hear their stance."**
*((The Knights aided another with Daiyu since she persuaded them. In turn, the Knights and Daiyu persuaded Emperor Roan Fel. Daiyu succeeds on her skill challenge. Now the other two players must pass this skill check to advance the negotiations forward.))*

Alvar remained silent and looked at Daiyu though at the sudden change in her mood, a small smirk forming across his face as his hand went to hold hers in a formal fashion for the setting they were in. **"There is the woman I fell in love with…"**
*As soon as you tell me whether it passes or not and what he gets from the check, I will post immediately.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-10-03 00:01:34)

Azlyn Rae nodded at the pledge of love from Malificere to Daiyu. **"But the council feels, her attachment to Lord Krayt. Surely you feel as much Dark Lord?"** The Imperial Knights looked at Malificere quizzically. Emperor Roan Fel turned away at this statement, his gold shoulder padding and purple cloak were all you could see of his visage.
One might wonder why they were considering Daiyu's feelings so much. Was she truly a threat to the assassination attempt? A cadre of Knights with a tactical advantage could most likely not be hindered by Daiyu even if she had something to do for Lord Krayt. The Sith knew this. Why was this such a problem?

---

### **zerah** (2012-10-03 07:24:02)

Daiyu glanced down to the hand with a blink, her expression softening though her resolve stayed. She knew now that she would have to take the time needed to make herself...better...again. She wondered if this was something she would have to see the ship's counselor for...or if there was some force counselor she should see. It would help if she could open her damn holocron and speak to her father but...save that for another time.
Her gaze turned back to the knights as something...stuck her.
"Why is it…that you all continue on with my feelings for him?" she says slowly, her tone controlled. The entire time since Alvar had admitted that she had been with him for two years they had stayed with it...why? she wasn't a threat to the operation, if she felt that she couldn't be present than she would stay on the ship! why did they continue to press the issue?
Her eyes narrowed "What's going on? why is this so important?" She felt a difference behind her and glanced over her shoulder at the man that turned away "And you turn at their question?" she looks back to the group, it was tugging at her now, were they hiding something? did they piece something together that she and the others didn't know?
"I will not hinder this." she stated "What is this fear? this attachment to the issue you continue to present?"

### **Maldoravia** (2012-10-03 19:18:28)

Maleficere turned pointedly to the Emperor and studied him for a moment before turning to address the entire assembly. **"I see what the issue might be…But as an established Admiral , THE Admiral of the Imperial Legate Fleet, I personally vouch for all of my crew's mindset. In the trust I showed by handing over my weapon, I hope you show me your trust by moving on from my Commodore's two year term abroad with Krayt. Let is turn, focus on the information that she has handed and find a more viable solution of how to depose him and place the True Emperor on the throne as easily as possible. I suggest and firmly stand by using the Death Star to cut right through his flag-ship. Either that, or see if we can somehow mobilize the Star Forges. We will need a distraction to catch his gaze, purposefully leaked intelligence maybe about someone going to Korriban to unearth dark secrets or…something similar. Anything that has to do with power he will assume automatically belongs to him, so we can use that to our advantage."**

The Emperor nodded solemnly as he faced the stained glass of the Imperial Knight decorum, depicting the gallant Knights all pointing their lightsabers to the sky. **"My Commodore, the issue is not the threat you pose now…but rather in the future. You are EXCEPTIONALLY strong in the Force. My Knights feel it, and you being with the Dark Side presents a tremendous threat. Even more so than you being currently attached to the Sith Empire."** 
He stopped as Darth Malificere spoke less eloquently than normal. Daiyu listened to him and she couldn't help but wonder....just wonder. He was mentioning the Death Star but there was a waver in his voice. She knew the lesson Master Ristrin had taught, about one of Vader's legendary quotes. It echoed through her head. *"The ability to destroy a planet, is insignificant next to the power of the Force."* Perhaps the mere mention of her Force potential had shaken up Darth Malificere's plan. Or was it something else? He did have a thirst for power, and being his rival and his lover...could complicate matters even worse. Malificere finished his last sentence speaking upon Darth Krayt's weakness. The Emperor turned to his council and awaited for a response. A knight spoke up from the crowd, a proud gray beard on display. **"My Lord, the Death Star would be an invaluable Naval asset. Especially since he is a well-versed Admiral. With the Death Star and an Admiral with a support fleet; We could swiftly end this war."**
Azlyn Rae countered his point with a comment of her own. **"The Dark Side still has a hold on them. The Emperor is right…the woman is extremely strong in the Force. Who knows where her future lies in the Sith Empire?"**
The Emperor looked over the Council. The advantages were great in enlisting the Sith Lords' help. But aiding them in the construction of a superweapon that might destroy them must not be taken lightly. The Emperor spoke again...**"My fellow Imperials-in-arms. I must ask you…can you relinquish the Sith Empire? Destroy its ideals once on the throne? Can you…aid us once you take the Throne of Krayt? We may even have to destroy your fellow Sith who you will be above. You must also understand we may one day remove you from the Throne. Can you accept these conditions?"**
*((Malificere accrues one failure for the skill challenge. But at the mention of his Admiralship he gains the Recover ability for the skill challenge. If he passes a skill challenge by 5 or more during the negotiation phase he may remove a failure. Now you must either make a deception on if you will go with the Emperor's ideals once Krayt is usurped…or persuade in favor of his ideals. All players must participate))*

This was the third time that someone had mentioned her being strong in the force, and she still did not understand it. She wasn't strong! both men beside her were stronger than she was, she'd only just unlocked any potential to learn how to use the thing! how can they say she was strong?
And they kept talking about the Sith as though they truly stood beside them...and Alvar...she couldn't remember the last time he'd wavered like that when trying to convince someone of something, she had her doubts too but....he always seemed so gun-ho about the damn station.
This had to stop. It had to. She turned her gaze on Alvar "Tell them." she said, her gaze as sharp as her tone. They had conditions when they had made up about him asking for her hand again, they needed to know what he had promised, sworn to her about the ancestors damned dark side.  "You tell them so they can stop making assumptions."

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-10-04 21:30:37)

Rand Ko folded his arms, adjusting the neck piece of his cloak uncomfortably. **"Yes, enlighten us. Apparently we have been assuming too much. Perhaps your mere presence of the Dark Side is obscuring our senses out of attunement."**
The Emperor continued to stride around the table, but made no indication or reaction to the Knight's statement. He was likely in agreement with him. What had been assumed?

### **Maldoravia** (2012-10-11 13:41:15)

Maleficere looked to those surrounding him before standing tall. A look of uneasiness crossed his face which was strange. Of all the times he had exposed this part of his life, of all the times he had relished in throwing it in others faces...He was hesitant to do it this time. He took a deep breath before motioning for everyone to listen. **"I have had enough of this back and forth bit from both sides…While I still do not think Daiyu would be a liability, I can understand your reasoning in this matter. However….To gain even further trust with you I am going to tell you perhaps my greatest secret of all time…even more than the Death Star plans, and even more than anything you have heard tonight."** Best not beat around the bush then, even though he hoped this wouldn't backfire. "**I would appreciate it if no one here laughed or called me untruthful when I say this, and hopefully this will end up helping us to our advantage."** He took a deep breath before letting the words out. "**I am the Son of the Late Emperor Palpatine. I can prove this to you, once I have my Father's holocron. Until then…"** He picked up his Lightsaber from Daiyu's bag and held it with a firm grip but still so everyone could see. **"This is his lightsaber. It is all the proof I have right now. I tell this to you all, so that you may trust my judgement."**
He then put the saber back with Daiyu before narrowing his eyes "**As for the Dark Side of the Force…Perhaps this will also help change your minds about us all? Once this is all over and done with, I plan to destroy the Sith. I plan to bring the entire order to a crumble so that none of their lies and filth can spread any longer. I have witnessed firsthand what they do and I will -not- be a part of it any longer…Krayt, along with every last Sith will perish. I have even told those around me to no longer call me Maleficere, but Admiral Alvar, or Admiral…or hell even just Alvar. If you cant see that we are going to try and do our best to end this mad age, and war, then I am not sure of where to go from here…We came to you for help, and hoped you would give us yours in return as well. We came to you with our hearts in our hands, our strength in our veins…throw down these walls of caution and let us finally understand that everyone here is willing to do whatever it takes…May we please, end this pointless debate of dark and light and start putting this plan into action."**

The Council burst into an uproar at the mention of being the son of Emperor Palpatine. Such words as impossible, outrageous, and how could it happen were being slung about the debate. Rand Ko slammed his fists into the table and rose to stare the Sith Lord down. **"What lies do you throw at us Sith Lord? There is no way a human son of Palpatine could have lived for an upwards of 130 some odd years! My Lord why must we listen to this?! You call our debates pointless, yet you are consumed by the Dark Side and we must trust someone who appears to be a lunatic with the most powerful weapon ever devised?!"** Azyln Rae, quite frustrated at Rand Ko's inability to negotiate properly, gestured at his cloak to sit back down...but he refused. **"By reading his thoughts, he certainly believes in what he is saying.**"
The Emperor paced about uneasily...moving to his throne but not taking a seat. **"Scribe Ibsen, we all sense that what the Sith is saying is true. But we must be cautious of the Dark Side here. We must appraise the weapon he possesses if he would honor us to surrender it."** The Emperor turned and faced the Sith Lord, his eyes staring him down intently. **"These deliberations are not pointless. There have been those who have been sworn never to fall to the Dark Side, but give in to its power and commit tremendous atrocities. The Dark Side has consumed you. You have committed evil. Now you question our motives by evaluating you cautiously in our negotiations? I *want* to trust you as an ally yet you lose patience with our methodologies. I am…..disappointed you feel this to be pointless. The Light and Dark Side of the Force determine the entire balance of the galaxy. Even more so with a superweapon in the equation. The philosophies of the Force must be very carefully examined. The Jedi believed in this, but perhaps that is why this concept eludes you. Now, if you would please…."**
The Imperial Knight Ibsen stood clad in his polished crimson armor, his gauntlet extended to receive Palpatine's lightsaber for examination.
*Some of the Council is believing in the spirit of Malificere's words, but the leading members are still cautious and are set aback by what they perceive to be a lack of patience. Malificere accrues another failure in the skill challenge. For now you may attempt to Use the Force to read surface thoughts of the Council members by using the Force. But this could backfire the negotiations by allowing them to have an easier sense to see your thoughts as well. Otherwise, the skill challenge is on hold until Malificere chooses to give up Palpatine's lightsaber or not.*

### **Maldoravia** (2012-10-12 11:54:52)

Maleficere felt embarrassed at how this was proceeding. "**I apologize if I worded things wrong, I did not mean to insinuate that this entire proceeding was pointless…Just the questioning of my officers. If it will help though, I will certainly surrender my weapon for examination. I do hope that it will not be…damaged? As I said, it is all I have left of him at the moment…"** He took his saber and handed it out to the Emperor. "**Remember, I have also stated that once Krayt is deposed I can further prove that I am Palpatine's son with the holocron that Krayt stole from me. I do not pretend to understand how I am his son, only that his holocron activated and he himself told me."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-10-12 17:07:18)

Knight Ibsen presented a ceremonial bow of his head as he took the weapon, gesturing for some sort of trust. He gave a cursory glance at the electrum plated lightsaber and quickly dismissed himself through the large duracrete doors at the opening of the chamber. Then, there was a sudden air of suspense that saturated the chamber. Azlyn Rae kept a smile through her striking features as Rand Ko went to review the notes Scribe Ibsen had left behind. He seemed unimpressed as the Knights table was caught in a loud whisper of conversation. The general gist of the conversation was clear. They <em>believed</em> in the Force that Malificere wasn't lying. There had been stranger things that had happened in the galaxy at any rate. So it was almost as if they were beginning to entertain the idea of Malificere's lineage to Palpatine.
But, even more than that. Perhaps a handful of Knights had realized this, but this presented a radical notion to the Imperial Knights and Roan Fel's Emperor if the impossible could be true. Emperor Roan Fel had prided himself as the true Emperor. The Imperial Knights' Empire had disciplined itself on adhering solely on the Imperial Viewpoint, whereas the Sith Empire used the Dark Side as the foundation of their ideals. Thus, that was the conflict between the two factions. It was difficult to argue against the Imperial Viewpoint. But at the same time, the one who invented the Viewpoint was Darth Sidious...with the Dark Side as his aide. But, Emperor Palpatine was the progenitor of the Imperial Viewpoint...and if the words Malificere spoke were true....this could be catastrophic to the Sith and Fel's Empire in terms of implications. The thoughts of the Council were in disarray and all Force disciples of the Sith could sense such thoughts. At that moment, Knight Ibsen entered the chamber bearing the weapon...or the "Sword of Destiny".
**"My Lord, the weapon does match up to what little specifications there are on regarding Palpatine's weapon of choice. It is completely authentic Electrum. It is composed of a nearly indestructible alloy called Phrik. The blade emitter is also aurodium. The blade uses a synth crystal which was custom for Sith warriors. Without a doubt, it *is* the finest lightsaber I have ever bore eyes upon. The only records shown the weapon was lost in the Coruscant Undercity in a duel with Mace Windu. This weapon would likely survive the fall, and it bears evidence of scuffing from a very high distance…but still very functional. It has been repaired to full functionality. However, there was no evidence of the weapon ever being recovered. It was unknown if Palpatine had the weapon at the time of his death in the destruction of the Death Star II."**
The Emperor's interest was now fully piqued as he requested to view the weapon . He held it in his hand firmly as he used the sunlight from the stained glass windows to view it.....
![250px-Sidiouslightsaberside.jpg.](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20051230230620/starwars/images/thumb/7/76/Sidiouslightsaberside.jpg/250px-Sidiouslightsaberside.jpg.) 
**"It has, an irrefutable Dark Side presence to it. I have never felt such a cold feeling in an imbued weapon."** The Emperor looked as if to ignite the powerful weapon....but he lowered it, for some reason not wanting to activate the lightsaber.
**"Lord Malificere, if you would not mind, we would like to have further appraisal on this weapon. But for now, you have shown us enough to move forward with your plan. There is something about you and your comrades that is very distinct. I will trust my feelings and the Force on this."**
Rand Ko began to show extreme disapproval as he stated it could be a masterfully crafted replica...but the Emperor dismissed it. They had enough to move forward with the Coup on Lord Krayt.
**"I do however, request one last notion from you and your comrades. Exactly *how* do you plan to defeat Lord Krayt? No Knight in this room has had the ability to do so…and we have had trouble locating him."**
*Here you must present your plan or say as you wish as the next part of the skill challenge. If you present the plan, you must succeed on a Knowledge Tactics check. Players can aid another or do so alone. But each player must contribute an actual tactical component to their advisement to gain the aid another benefit.*

When he opened his mouth, she had a suddenly bad feeling in her gut. And lo and behold the idiot brought up heritage, was she the only sane person to never mention her possible heritage?! She promptly kicked him in the shin, which she'd later deny doing on purpose, and glared at him so hard if she had the power he'd have melted.
As it stood, things proceeded, she tensed when the weapon was handed off and only relaxed slightly when it was returned to the room and her sight, but at the history she tensed again and grabbed Alvar's hand, squeezing in a warning as she stared a look at him that said if *you so much as breathe a thought of mentioning anything they'd gone through she'd break something in his body.* She would not, would *not* betray master's orders here.
At the final mention of how, and the little luck they've had; the emerald eyed woman had a thought. "I can find him…" she said, her tone was shocked, she didn't remember giving her brain the order to speak but there it was.
She looked to Alvar, he'd remember, and it was dangerous but it was an idea "He asked me before we came here remember? I can find him…I could maybe even lure him someplace more private and away from guards.." something in her twisted as she talked, her heart hurt at the thought but she had to keep reminding herself that it was needed, he had used her and twisted her head and she wouldn't forgive him for that.
She had to pull the memory of security in her fathers arms when she had passed out on his palace floor, that feeling of relief to know herself to push the pain aside. She could do this...maybe tell him she'd like to give her answer in person...

*About six Imperial Knights attempt to come the aid of Commodore Daiyu as she made her assessment of a strategy to defeat Lord Krayt, they are not however trained in Knowledge Tactics.*
The debate table was curious as to how this could work. A few junior members among the Imperial Knights spoke up, suggesting that luring the Emperor by himself is indeed a good strategy. But this did not impress Commodore Daiyu, she had studied years upon years of battle strategies and Naval Deployment tactics. They were simply agreeing with her notion, though they meant well. The leading members of the Knight's Council, appeared to be a bit more tactically savvy. A Knight stood amongst the group; a man with very weathered features, richly white beard, and white hair spoke to the group .**"I am Knight Sinde. An honor to speak to you Commodore. While you offer a good suggestion, you are strong in the Force. He will most likely sense that something is amiss when you go to lure him into a trap. He is likely cunning enough to take your offer, but could lure us all into a counter ambush to deal a crushing attack to his conspirators."**
The leading members of the Council seemed to conclude with Knight Treis Sinde. The Emperor turned to Lord Malificere. His eyes intent and gazing. He did have some hope that luring him alone was there best chance, but Krayt would not likely be easily duped. **"All this seems to be of your devising. Do you have anything to aid us in the defeat of the Dark Lord?"**
*Malificere make a knowledge tactics check here to assist Daiyu's initiative.*

Maleficere looked to the Emperor and took in a deep breath and quieted himself as he ran through his mind, trying to find at least something that could help with this most dangerous and devious plans. He didn't like Daiyu being bait, but at this moment there was little option.

As Malificere ran through his mind the possibilities of overthrowing the Sith, his mind simply drew emptiness. He remembered....vividly...of how easily he had dispatched of his Father in the Coruscant Jedi Temple. He didn't know the full potential of his power but had witnessed it and felt it. If he had any sort of reinforcements the task would be difficult indeed. The Knights were right as well, he would sense something amiss with Daiyu if not careful. The striking Knight Orcia shook her head...
**"My lord forgive us. We brought them before you in great aspirations of defeating Lord Krayt. But it seems they have no solidarity or ideals in their tactics.**"
The Emperor sensed it as well, Malificere had doubt in the plan, and the only one who showed any remote possibility of concocting a plan was the Naval Commodore.
**"I will not commit the loyalty of my Knights in exchange for bloodshed to a cause that could prove to be fruitless."**
He walked slowly and deliberately to Commodore Daiyu. His velvet cape gliding gracefully across the stone steps. **"I sense hesitation in Lord Malificere. Tis understandable; Darth Krayt is most fierce indeed. But perhaps you would honor us the details of your idea?"**
There it was. For once in Alvar's (Malificere's) life, he was at a loss for words in a matter of diplomacy. The Knights looked upon Commodore with slight enthusiasm. This wasn't the first time....she had shown great potential as a leader. The officer had to stop two frothing Sith Lords from trifling on the bridge in front of all the men, and had succeeded. The imperial lady had earned great respect from the crew on that day; a task that Malificere was accustomed to. But now, the prestigious Imperial Knights looked at Commodore Daiyu, the colored rank on her chest gleaming in Malificere's eye. They had said her potential with the Force was greater than anyone...was this an example of her clairvoyance? He felt the Yerrik Bug twitch on his spine...it had sensed his uneasiness. There was a beast within Malificere...perhaps metaphorically as well as physically.

Daiyu squared her shoulders, it was...unusual that he had gone so quiet, he was always full of ideas but it had been two years...maybe whatever Krayt had done had taken a toll. None of them had really taken much time to regroup or anything really, not that it mattered to her, she had found a strength in herself that she refused to let go.
She tensed as the Emperor came around to stand behind her and let her mind agree that, that was going to be something to address later, to fix or not to be decided, not having people at her back. She didn't turn to look at him though, simply kept her attention to those that looked her in the face instead of at the back of her head.
"He asked me to marry him again." she started "before we agreed to come here. He has always requested privacy when we spoke…I suppose so he could put on the face I've come to know or so that he truly could relax." talking was giving her a chance to analyze her memories, read into things that she just...hadn't before, something else to think one later.  "I could tell him I have an answer, one that should be given in person. I could even tell him yes and insist on a planet of my choosing for a wedding." there were options in that. She'd spent enough time watching nobles and speaking to a few lucky women, or unlucky if they had been attempting to persuade her to the good points on marrying the man, but it was a noble thing, the bride given free reign to plan her perfect day; in theory, she could ask to have a private wedding with only themselves and close 'friends', his apprentice most likely.
"I could get him alone, we usually talked in the gardens on Couricant, I know that there was always a small number near, but a small group could take them out while we go farther away." She knew it was dangerous for a person to be bait, more so for one that had been...conditioned, she supposed was a good word for now, as they were more likely to turn sides...but she was an Imperial dammit, and she was a shock-box champ, she could defend herself. Her mind played through various scenes of could be and in all of them she knew...knew...that if anyone could get close enough to knife him, to snap his neck, to disarm him...it was going to be her...or someone else that he wanted by his side.
She brought her attention back to them "His implant would be the best target. It could kill him easily, or…it could die and he could survive but without it…he might be less of a challenge." she didn't know how it really worked, he could die without it completely, or it could be the base of everything, he might become...a non, without it. She knew Alvar didn't like it, knew they didn't either, but...it was the best shot she had.

Rand Ko, boisterous as always raised his chest proudly at the notion presented. **"This must be the Will of the Force. A plan like this is perfect to destroy Lord Krayt if she can get so close to him."** Azlyn Rae was quick to make a counter-point. **"Her thoughts on marriage, are difficult to see. It is in motion. But I believe she still harbors some feelings for Darth Krayt."**
The Emperor nodded to his counsel, but spoke quickly. **"Knight Ko is right, regardless of the dangers…this is a perfect plan to defeat Lord Krayt. We will have Commodore Daiyu gain his trust of sacred matrimony, then we will kill him."**
The Council went into a hushed conversation. They said there was a chance of a counter ambush. But, it was as if the Emperor picked this up through the Force and not with his ears. **"My loyal Knights, do not fear. This will be our primary initiative to defeat Krayt. The Imperial Knights shall remain stationed at a ready position for a secondary initiative should Commodore Daiyu's and the Sith's plan fails. Because this is such a great opportunity, we must take it as guidance from the Force."**
Azlyn Rae shook her head, **"Or the lure of the Dark Side."**. The council was not pleased at her retort, but they certainly understood. The Emperor turned to his faithful knight and responded in turn. **"That is also a possibility. But as you stated, the situation will always be in motion as we attempt to see it with the Force. But here, we must trust our feelings that the Dark Side can be overcome."**
Knight Ibsen, the historian made his appraisal of the situation as well. **"My lord there is two sides to this plan. If Lord Krayt senses any deceit in Commodore Daiyu, it may cost the Sith and Commodore their lives. But, on the other hand….Legend states that a Sith Lord can be blinded by his passion. This was the case when Darth Vader overthrew Lord Sidious…his own rage and passion blinded him to the fact that betrayal was imminent. That being said, if Krayt truly feels love and attachment for Daiyu, the Dark Side will cloud his judgment…enabling Commodore Daiyu to strike."**
The Emperor smiled, proud of his scholarly Knight. **"Impressive…but the danger will primarily fall upon the trio we have been honored to meet today. The question is, if Krayt does favor Commodore Daiyu….Can you make that lethal attack?"**
The words from Knight Ibsen could have echoed through Daiyu's head. If he *truly* had feelings for her then he would be easier to kill. Easier to kill in terms of methodology. But would that mean easier to kill in terms of gumption? Was it right for Daiyu to commit such an act, if he extends his hand in love? If he was willing to offer his heart forward...despite all his suffering...could she make that killer blow? Must Daiyu deceive Lord Krayt into a pledge of love, only to destroy something so sacred? Nevertheless, in either case, Lord Krayt would be hard to kill.

### **zerah** (2012-10-31 19:05:46)

The scholars words rang in Daiyu's head, over and over again. She had thought of it, she had, she had weighed the options and the best one was this plan was...was putting all of this on her to destroy him.
But the words, the notion that he could actually love her even after all he did...could she do it? *of course I could* part of her yelled out in her head at the doubt *after all he did to mess with my head why couldn't I kill him?…even if he actually did come to love me…*
The times together continued to play in her head, the different scenarios playing after one another; she couldn't do it, he'd kill her;
She couldn't do it, he'd forgive her and kill the others;
She could do it, and despair at the life she'd taken when all other lives meant little;
She could do it, and watch coldly as the life drained from him.
All parts of it broke something in her heart; he had truly wormed deep into her thoughts and emotions but...she would...for the good of the galaxy...so that Alvar could take his rightful place, so that Master would be proud, so that.....
....
What would her father say? would he be proud? would he be dissapointed?
Krayt was the only one outside of the three of them that knew her lineage, what if he spoke of it to them...what would they do? would they take her for a traitor because of whom her family is?..even though she'd never met them?
Could she live with herself for using him? she'd have to...
Daiyu's head lowered slightly in thought, if she couldn't...she'd leave...and she'd go to the home that they had won and...and something...

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-02 02:00:21)

The Knight Council went silent. Nightfall was cascading it's decadent splendor through the stained glass...almost as if to symbolize the fall of the Dark Side over the symbolic representations of the Imperial Knights on the window. The Council watched Commodore Daiyu closely as two attendants came to light torches in the debate chamber. Rand Ko looked closely on the officer. **"Her thoughts carry heavy conflict. There is much burden within her soul."** 
The Emperor did not seem pleased as to how the deliberations were proceeding. Nonetheless, he sensed the woman's feelings, and had great respect for them. He felt she was a person that was truly yearning to define her place in the galaxy, yet was always overshadowed. The Force was telling him these ideas as clear as Nubian skies. Because of these notions, it compelled him to speak. **"Commodore Daiyu of the Imperial Navy; Darth Krayt has committed genocide. He will continue to rule by fear and commit atrocious acts. He must be neutralized. You have a great…passion for this man. But do not underestimate the powers of the Dark Side. He may even believe in what he is doing is right, he may mean well. Undoubtedly he has witnessed your potential with the Force, and that is what he truly seeks. Perhaps as a minion…and….some sort of mate."**
The Emperor faced the woman his velvet cloak sweeping across the stone ground. **"Thus, the decision is yours. We will not lose who we are in an attempt to fell our enemy. But…what troubles me….is that the Sith remain…silent. What is it that troubles them so? You all do not seem to be working in solidarity with your plans…it worries me."**
As the Knight Council looked to the Sith, Daiyu's eyes most likely wandered to Malificere's paling complexion. He was....eerily quiet. Was he...plotting? Was there envy brooding in him? The Council undoubtedly saw something in Commodore Daiyu. Was that bothering him? As if to break up any thought patterns, the large durawood doors opened with a creak...two 501st guards escorted a beautiful female clad in white into the audience chamber. She looked to the Emperor Roan Fel....
![MarasiahFel.jpg](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100627030446/starwars/images/c/c4/MarasiahFel.jpg)
**"Apologies father for being so unforgivably late. The proceedings with the Ithorian Ambassadors had taken quite some time. They wish to send aide to the Mon Calamari…and my voice…well….is not quite pure as yours. How may I serve father?"**
Rand Ko immediately ordered all Knights to kneel, including the Sith and Commodore Daiyu. These words would echo in Malificere's head....**"Kneel to our princess, the *heir* to the *true* Emperor of the throne."**

### **Maldoravia** (2012-11-04 22:03:00)

Maleficere had what he considered to be an emotional overload, so much to the point that he was running on autopilot and that he also felt none...just from the sheer amount that had enveloped him for a brief moment during the talks.
**"I am…conflicted about this plan, but for the sake of the Galaxy itself…I will concede the sheer fact that what Daiyu says is true. This plan is our best and possibly only chance…"** was all he said before he was jerked from his thoughts as the woman entered the room, bowed and remained silent for a few moments before dismissing the voice from his head in a gentle way. Right now the last thing he wanted was someone in his head, able to feel what he felt. As it so happened, things did not seem to be happening the way he wanted...at all. It would be time for some drastic measures if things did not improve yet he knew he had played every card that they had...unless one of the others were holding something back.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-04 22:38:20)

The human female dressed in pristine white walked to greet the Sith Empire emissaries. She extended her hand delicately, her large eyes piercing and beautiful as she peered into the Dark Side followers' faces. "I am Marasiah Fel. It is a pleasure to meet you, even if you are considered our enemies. We do share some common ground, as I am but a servant of the Imperial Viewpoint…as are you. Can someone honor me with the proceedings I missed? Scribe?"
Scribe Ibsen took a moment to let Princess Fel review the hearing via a flimsiplast parchment. The Emperor took a moment to look upon his daughter then speak. **"Then, the charge of this grave undertaking rests on the shoulders of Commodore Daiyu. She shall be a primary initiative in overthrowing Lord Krayt. My Knights are ready to do their part should Commodore Daiyu fail in her quest. Once he is defeated, we will speak of where our alliance will go from there."**
Rand Ko quickly objected. **"They *do* supposedly have the blueprints for the Death Star, suppose we make the Sith Empire more powerful by aiding them?"**
The Emperor responded in turn. **"I am aware of this. As such, we will ask to see such blueprints before we commit to the assault. You will provide us with a duplicate copy, in the event you become just as tyrannical as Darth Krayt, we have the means to quickly defeat you. At this current rate, Darth Krayt is causing tremendous damage. He must be stopped now. Failure on your part to provide us the blueprints to your Death Star III will force our negotiations to an unpleasant tangent. So…we need the pledge of your Commodore to the defeat of Lord Krayt, and the design specifications to the Death Star."**
Princess Marasiah Fel could not believe her ears. *"A Death Star? Why would we trust any Sith wanting to construct such a weapon."* The Knight Council was now objecting saying that the Death Star could destroy a planet before their Empire could react, even with the plans. But Roan Fel insisted that any Sith with a plan can easily see it through, so it was best to form an alliance now to minimize the catastrophe. The proceedings had grown more complicated. Great burdens were now resting on the Commodore and Lord Malificere.
Could Commodore Daiyu kill this potential love interest? A man who has been completely honest with her? Even more than that, would Lord Malificere have his hand forced by giving up specifications of the third Death Star? Could he even obtain them?
All eyes to the Council turned to the Sith Emissaries, as the fate of the galaxy was becoming shouldered on them. Had it been since their birth? Was this the beginning of their destiny? Was it the turning point? The end?! Master Ristrin, consumed by the Dark Side, was still human...and he instilled that into his students. The students of Master Ristrin had always had difficult choices to make, but none like this...
The Emperor spoke to break up the silence and tension. **"Furthermore, to ensure the success and my confidence in this mission. I will pledge myself personally to the defeat of Lord Krayt. If this fails, I am ready to become one with the Force."**
The Emperor had to silence his knights after this, they knew his importance. His survival was of utmost importance. But the Emperor believed the risks were worth it, he had put great faith in the Sith Emissaries. There was much at stake, but the Emperor knew at this point in the war innocent lives were being lost. The Sith had to fall.

### **zerah** (2012-11-07 07:13:06)

Daiyu watched the woman as she moved, as she spoke, as she caught up...she felt threatened in some small sense really, and it had everything to do with Alvar.
*Why does everything seem to come back to men…ha ha I see how you're still manipulating things Master, still testing us, very good…knock it off.* 
Beautiful woman and already has a place for the throne, has a bloodline to claim it before Alvar and allies to back her. She glanced to her side briefly to gauge his reaction. He didn't seem to care much of her...but what if that was new training? she'd be a better choice if he wanted to simply control the throne...but no, he loved her...they'd been through so much and he did love her...right? right...that's why she was doing all of this.
*Dammit girl, get your thoughts back together. You're a guard, you'd a disciple of your master, and dammit you're the daughter of two well known and powerful Jedi that had even Krayt concerned, you can do this.*
At least the pep talk was helping (*hidden, keep things hidden, ancestors only know what they'd do if they knew*) to get her priorities back, even if she was tense, and continued to tense more every time the emperor moved to her back.
*can't he just stay still!? calm….be calm….wait what are they talking about?*
The plans...oh no...they didn't have the plans yet. And didn't she say that it was up to only them to build it? there were so many things that were still being hidden from them...*I hate you master…sometimes I really truly hate you.*
She turned to her partners beside her, how would they get the plans?

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-07 15:54:55)

The Princess was now at the side of her father's throne, glancing at the electrum plated throne...the material just the same as Malificere's heirloom. She glanced to Daiyu and quickly searched the Force. Daiyu could sense her presence in the Force stood out, just as much as any Imperial Knight in the council, if not more. It was as if Daiyu was looking into a dark room and saw brilliant torches illuminating all around. Princess Marasiah Fel's fire burned with a brilliant luminescence. It made shadows when comparing her to Malificere and Invictus.
**"Father, her thoughts are deep. She has put much thought to the Sith amongst her. Her past is that of suffering. But she has strength she has yet realized."**
The Emperor seemed puzzled. She had read the Commodore with ease..and what was more confounding is that Daiyu had little in the presence of the Force, yet had great potential.
**"Marasiah, you've grown quite attuned with the Force. But another reason you read her so well is her affinity to the Force. It truly beckons. There is no doubt Lord Krayt has also sensed this in the Commodore. But she is …troubled. This shall make the quest more difficult than I originally thought. This triumvirate still has many questions to life. That is in good nature…but maybe not for the task at hand. They are still searching the Force, as we all must do. But with their passion…"**

---

### **zerah** (2012-11-07 18:50:43)

Daiyu saw flame, it felt like a literal sense, the others were lights but that was a damn flaming beacon! how the hell did someone get so...flame like??
and then she felt it. The presence within the force, she still wasn't used to it, to having a sense that was open when it had been closed. She didn't understand, she didn't have proper training, she was overwhelmed by it all...
But most of all, she felt the warning bells, the sirens go off in her head at the ease she had; she felt like the world suddenly narrowed and everything in her seized up. Her arms crossed, legs crossed in what likely was looked to be a simple move for comfort but her entire body inside tensed, she could feel her bones tense.
And then her mind just clamped down. She swore she could hear durasteel doors slam closed over her entire body; her gaze narrowed on the woman, the threat; she didn't blink, she barely breathed, her nails were gripping at her arms so tightly she was sure she'd leave marks even through her clothes.
Pure defense, fight or flight active, though flight had been trained from her long...long ago. She was conscious of the weight of her saber on her hip, the one she hadn't shown to anyone, that was always hidden, the feel of the chair at her back though now it was barely touching her. The foot on the floor had pressure on her toes to help her move if it was needed.
she'd later analyze things and come to believe that it was too much at once, it was a fear to have her history unveiled without her say, that it was a a new reaction to the presence of force users after everything Krayt had laid to her mind and the fights with the sith on their ship. This...controlled, tense control, was the calculated snapping of some panic. Her gaze was hard, features appearing relaxed unless one knew what it was to look for, or even close enough to notice...or to sense the sudden shut down. The way her head had snapped to the woman, the feathered first braid still swayed.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-07 21:39:12)

Rand Ko observed the Sith-Imperials as they remained silent on the matter. He shifted his weight in his chair. **"My liege, I believe they are having a change of heart. Or at least the Commodore, since the mission will fall directly on her. They came before us so zealous to destroy Lord Krayt and now I sense great hesitance."**
Princess Marasiah Fel jerked her head slightly in an involuntary manner; it was in perfect tandem with the Commodore's thoughts of perceiving her as an enemy. She adjusted her pristine white cloak and gestured slightly. **"Tell me, what is it about me that frightens you so? You barely know me…"**
Rand Ko heard this pointed out and spoke in return. **"They have fear, they have hesitance. The conflict within in them is significant. I believe the Dark Side has a tighter grip on them than they realize. Or, I hate to point this out…but I believe the Dark Side is influencing them more than we initially realized."**
The Emperor returned to his throne and took a seat. He needed to be at rest to quickly gather his thoughts and assess the proceedings through the Force. The Emperor thought to himself before considering to speak, hoping the Sith-Imperials would say something in their defense. ***"This complicates matters. They come seeking alliance but may lack the resolve to see that alliance through to the end…and the Dark Side beckons at their very souls."***

---

### **zerah** (2012-11-09 19:58:44)

Daiyu glared at the woman, eyes narrowed before she stood, body tense "I am sick and tired of hearing all of you question us as though we are not here, as though we don't know what it is we're getting into as though we know nothing about any of this!" She shouted, emotions were high, she was tense, and angry, and afraid of the future, and this....they had worn her last nerve down.
She shifted her glance to the table "None of you even know us! not as people or anything more than what you think you know!" she scolded them, she turned to the Emperor "You continue to speak on the dark side and what you feel it doing or what you feel of what future or presence but you don't know how it is truly effecting us or if it even is."
She turned her gaze back around, gaze sharp, the beads and braids and feathers tied in her hair shifting with her movements "you see Sith. That's all you see, you don't see how it was they got that way, you don't know what it was they went through, you don't know if it was even their choice!" she shouted, motioning to those on either side of her. She took a breath and steadied her voice "you just judge. and you presume you have the right because of the side you chose, it doesn't matter that there was no say for others, it doesn't matter that the task you give is one *none* of you can do and yet you think that we should do it without a care or thoughts. How does that make you better than *him*."
She rounded then on the princess "And you go poking in someone's head, in their side of the force, in anything in their bubble without knowing them and then presume they fear *you*? Who are *you* to invoke fear in *me*." she spat coldly. "Until this moment, I didn't know you existed. You are *nothing* to be feared, and you have not gained the *respect* of those before you. Don't expect it from title alone."
She looked over the faces "You don't know us. You don't know our background, and you don't know our lives." she said slow, cold, calculated "I gave up information that was trusted to me, agreed to kill someone that I care about for the betterment of the galaxy and you expect me to what? smile and prance off as though it means nothing? that means nothing? If that's what this side does than I pity you, and those forced under that mentality."  she lifted her head and glared "Don't. Judge. Us." She all but growled.
She moved from her chair, too wound and tense, and in desperate need to regain her control she headed for the door, but by the way that the current instincts demand from a fight; back towards the wall, and eyes watching them until she could escape out the door, she didn't care that she had left a meeting without permission, as far as she was concerned, the mission rested on them. The knights would do nothing and everything now rested on her shoulders. She had every right to leave and hide away to meditate and ground herself again.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-09 23:09:57)

The ivory bearded Knight Sinde rose to his feet, appalled at the outburst by the Commodore. **"Such disrespect! My lord, why do we negotiate with these Sith any longer?! They have no patience. They are brutes with no sense of diplomacy! And for a 'Commodore' she shows little knowledge of Imperial distinction or honor that we have prided ourselves on for since the formation of the Empire."**
The Emperor quickly dismissed the Knight and ordered two Imperial Knights to ensure that Commodore Daiyu would not leave the Knights' palace. He rose from the throne. He began towards the large duracrete doors to pursue the Commodore slowly. **"Continue speaking with our guests. I will talk to the Commodore alone."**
Some of the Knights did not like this idea, they wanted him to have protection...but the Emperor was not concerned with his safety at the moment. Meanwhile, Daiyu had stepped just outside the audience chamber to be stopped by two Imperial Knights, the look in their eyes stoic and dutiful. Before they could say anything the Emperor dismissed their presence. It was just the Commodore and the "true" Emperor now, in the drafty hallways of the Imperial Knight palace. He kneeled down next to Daiyu, as she had obviously rested her postured significantly. His cloak and clothing were likely to get dust on them from the duracrete flooring, but he didn't mind. He was expressing a human side by sitting next to the Commodore.
His face turned to her with a grim look on his face, the gold circlet around his forehead didn't do much to hide his aging features. He spoke quietly and gently, attempting to calm the Commodore. **"You are correct, about a great many things. Unfortunately….we were judging you. Perhaps too harshly, and for that I apologize on behalf of my Knights and myself. However, we have to know who we are forming an alliance with. The Dark Side *is* strong with Malificere. That cannot be ignored.**
**"Most importantly, you are right that we don't know you. That is what has myself and the Council worried. The Sith are infamous for insidious plots to lure their enemies into situations which could benefit them immensely. We are simply trying to ensure this isn't the case. Which, I don't believe that it is now. The one you care for, Lord Malificere, is strong in the Dark Side. He could be clouding my own judgement on this matter. It has happened to many force practitioners throughout the ages. But, I hope I expressed to you clearly enough that I understood the burden you had. That is why I stated the mission would proceed if you were ready to shoulder such a burden. I will not condemn one good soul to defeat an evil one….that is my stance. Please Commodore…understand that I value a unified Empire… An Empire that does not draw upon the knowledge of the Dark Side for its guidance. Please understand that you may be key to ensuring this. I do not see you as an asset. Rather as an individual who comes seeking answers…answers to your very existence. You have begun by searching through the Force. I hope you find what you seek, because the passion you exude demonstrates a strong yearning for life. Above all, I believe you simply want to be seen and understood for who *you* truly are. I don't believe any person can tell you this…though they can help. The Force will guide you…as it does all living beings."**
Commodore Daiyu could see in the Emperor that he meant what he said. He had no desire to force the issue, yet he realized its importance.

---

### **zerah** (2012-11-09 23:51:57)

Daiyu had ignored the knights, though she had punched the wall once before sliding down it, wrapping her arms around her legs as she drew them up.
It was funny really...the last time she'd sat in that same position was before the trial when they were told to leave their childhood behind in the sand. She didn't move at the sound of cloth, or steps leaving, she had a feeling someone would follow...granted she hadn't expected him.
She listened quietly and was silent after, taking the time to breathe and get herself under control before she could even think of speaking. "The dark side is in his blood." she said finally "deep down to the core. It only made it's way out when Krayt got his hands on him." she says softly.
"those…knights…so called knights, they have their own beliefs." she pointed out, raising her head and resting it back against the wall, looking up to the ceiling, she wasn't crying, she refused that sort of emotion here. "So do we. We have our own values and how we see to do things." she motions vaguely to the door "They….are never going to see things how you do." she says haltingly. "You can speak all you like, and they'll agree, but deep down…they won't agree. They'll believe what they want and when it comes to things they'll justify their beliefs for everything. We could die in this and they'd find some way to blame the dark side."
She pauses here and shakes her head, thinking for a long time "We're orphans…did you know that? did they? do they all know their heratige? their lineage? their parents? We don't…Alvar learned his first and only through his holocron. I learned through Krayt. I don't even know if…if Invictus knows his or how he'll learn." She sighs faintly "You know it was all kept from us? everything. Said it was something for us to learn on our own in time. so we learn through strangers, and struggle harder." 
She frowns faintly "Did you know he had to make the choice to allow our ship and our entire crew be destroyed…or kill the only family we'd ever known?" She doesn't let him respond "You wouldn't know. The crew didn't understand it either. There's other things…but I will not say them even if I want to. I made a promise, a vow, and I'll keep it even to my grave." she sighed "I don't like the dark side." she states after a moment "It…does things to people and it makes them forget who they were…it's sad…I've seen it. You sense darkness around Alvar but in truth…he's coming back to the light…" she hums thoughtfully "Maybe that's what he meant…." she mumbles, more to herself than him "It'll always be part of him but…he wouldn't be him without it…so it's okay."
She glances to him out of the corner of her eye "My point is. You shouldn't judge…nor let others judge, those you want to ally yourself with. You shouldn't presume, or let others presume…you don't know what the wrong words…meant so innocently can do to a person with a trigger and bad memories….or prior programing…" she adds "You…you're different than they are. You're listening. you're trying. But all your efforts are meaningless if the people under you show disrespect." She turns her gaze away again "Since we came in, we've been scrutinized, questioned, mocked even, judged, looked at with disregard, hated maybe, ridiculed certainly…Alvar stated who his father was and he was nearly laughed at. That's a not a place for alliance." she motions to the door "That's a place for trial. I won't go through another Trial when I'm trying to help the galaxy. We've gone through enough in our short lives."
She sighs softly "And no disrespect meant, but your daughter should learn when to state things she feels and when not to. Were I anyone but me…were I violent, or more developed, or…anything. What she said? and where my thoughts were? she broke privacy. She could have innocently viewed something I maybe hadn't kept tightly enough away from thoughts, and if she spoke it?" She shook her head and sighed "I would have attacked. I will be honest, were I anyone else, I would have. It's bad enough to have to learn things with others that are learning, none of us need someone who has no restraint on her mouth and the force at the same time."
It was weird. She hated having him at her back, but...he brought himself away from guards, to sit on the floor, to see how she was and to explain himself...she respected that of him. There was honor in this. And Daiyu valued honor.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-10 00:18:37)

The Emperor listened intently, he did not like all that he heard... But he was certainly used to it in a position such as his. "We...had no other choice but to evaluate your characters. We must know who it is we will potentially be spilling our blood with. It is very intrusive, and I apologize. We at war... You and I. But I believe war is not your calling. However, trust me when I say I speak for my Knights' best interest. They have fought Sith and watched their friends die at their sabers' edge. That can cloud their judgement."
"Their loyalty is sworn to me, yet they will back you with their very lives if you choose to undertake this mission. They will not do it under fealty towards me, rather towards duty. I believe duty is service to a major cause that goes beyond the scope of a single person. They may show some apprehension to you. But they are trained to remain...empty...clear..so that the answers they seek present themselves. In time, they could learn to respect you...especially with your tremendous contributions to our cause which I believe in my heart to be noble. We only judged you but what we could sense in the moment. We don't know your past, you're absolutely right. There was no choice but to search our feelings and the Force for the right choices to move forward in an alliance with you. But, I admire your passion. It cannot be expressed enough. At your age I can't help but wonder why you have not received more training in the art of the Force. "

Maleficere was really getting tired of them second guessing him for his silence. There was not a shred of hesitation in his resolve. Krayt needed to die. That was fact and he would certainly see to it himself if need be, with or without these doddering fools. It wasn't entirely his fault that he had this thrust upon him...He never asked to be the heir. It was getting so tiring that this moment he wasn't even thinking about what his father would do in this situation...for once, he honestly didn't care. He finally stood up now and looked to those present before saying **"I suppose this is really all that will become of this discussion. You obviously can't see past your own reserves, and that is not your fault. The Sith have certainly made their mark in what you think about them, that is on them. But I am still an Admiral. I came hoping to use diplomatic discussions…But it seems, that your fears and loathing of the Sith shall overpower anything that has to do with us. I will caution you, all of you, that fear in any sense of the word leads to anger….and we all know what road that leads to. So I suggest you stop being afraid if you do not want to possibly be what I was. It saddens, as well as deeply wounds me, that these negotiations have gone in a dismal direction…Perhaps, despite all of our vocalizations of Krayt, perhaps what we all need to overcome is our fear of him. All of us that are present have witnessed his atrocities at one point or another. It was because of those, that I awoke Daiyu's affinity to the force before Krayt could. If THAT does not help you understand my resolve, that I did that without his permission, knowing fully well he wanted that pleasure for himself, then I am at a loss Ladies and Gentlemen. If that does not open your eyes, then perhaps it is I who have failed you all."**
He then sat back down, calm as ever, and waited for a reaction.

Knight Sinde remained on his feet, growing ever aware the Sith were impatient and ready for resolution. **"There is a fine line between caution and fear. You told us you have access to a Superweapon yet lose your patience when we continue to thoroughly evaluate you. Such a weapon must be treated with *extreme* caution, that is why we deliberate so. I'm sorry if this feels as a waste of time to you or irritates you that we are attempting to resolve this matter through words. However, this Council needs no lecture of fear and where it leads. Spare us your philosophies on the Force, we are well-educated on the matter. For you yourself are saturated with the Dark Side. This Council bears no evidence of leaning towards the Dark Side. But you grow impatient, and want a decision…thus….we shall grant you one now…pending any objections. With all due respect, we are sorry if we have offended you in any manner."** 
The Knight Council spoke to themselves as Scribe Ibsen thoroughly wrote the proceedings down on a flimisplast and a datapad. Then, the Emperor was summoned and he sat on his throne. The Council members took a moment to speak with the Emperor individually and he reviewed Scribe Ibsen's notes. The Emperor stood, ready to make proclamation on the current affairs.
**"We have come to a conclusion regarding the matter of destroying Lord Krayt. If you accept our resolution, we will move forward in our alliance."**
The Emperor awaited for Daiyu to return to the Imperial audience chamber. ((*Whether or not she does can be retconned))*. He then gestured with his arms open for the Sith to hear his words. **"It is the findings of the Imperial Knight Council that we agree to assassinate Lord Krayt for the good of our Empire and the galaxy. The Imperial Knights will fully devote to this operation with Commodore Daiyu as the primary effort. My Knights will serve as the secondary initiative should she fail to kill him. Furthermore, the plans to your Death Star will be given to us. We understand that you will likely have secondary blueprints but we would like an unaltered copy for ourselves. I shall personally oversee the transferring of the blueprints. Furthermore, once Lord Krayt is destroyed, you will keep me informed on all matters regarding Lord Malificere's position on the throne and his governance. We will also personally keep thorough supervision on any matters regarding the Death Star. We will appoint three Imperial Knights to accompany you at all times to keep us constantly informed on your Superweapon, the Death Star. Now we ask…Do you agree to these terms?"**
*((Keep in mind, the decision made by the Knight Council was affected by roleplay input by all PC's and the failure of the Skill Challenge was also noted. If any of you feel this is unfair by the rules or something is amiss…please feel free to contact me.))*

Daiyu was unwilling to return to the room even after the talk with the Emperor. She didn't need nor want to sit there and see judgement passed on her before she'd even had a chance to try. How could they not see the monumental task they hefted upon her shoulders? the task that they put to weigh on her soul, on her very being.
No, she sat there in the hall a few minutes longer, but the urge to leave, to vanish and allow herself what she needed...time to think, time to mourn (be it for Krayt or herself she wasn't sure yet), time...just time.
So she chanced a glance up at the knights not far away down the hall, waited a moment, stilled her body and breath and then shifted, moving with the dark spots along the hall; leaving her less than ideal hiding place to wander.
Her thoughts ran after her, pain chased her, voices or memories scolded her as she moved silently, turning here...there...there had to be a garden somewhere, palaces seemed to have that, maybe there she'd have the solitude she needed.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-22 15:51:18)

Daiyu walked along the drafty hallways as her polished high-rise Imperial boots stepped atop the duracrete flooring. She spotted a rising staircase and there didn't appear to be any Knights in this area. The Imperial lady walked up the long staircase as her thoughts ascended just as her physical self did. So much burden she carried, but it was like this long-winding staircase. She just kept moving forward no matter the steps she had to take. At the top of the staircase, she arrived to a small passageway to a city-observation platform. There were two Imperial Knight Statues flanking the archway into the outside platform, they were crossing lightsabers ceremoniously as she walked underneath them to the platform.
She observed Ravelin City. It was years ago this was the home of her Imperial training. She had been trained as a stormtrooper and ran countless, tiring bridge simulations aboard various Star Destroyer types. She was studious, perhaps not as much as Janelle...and not as vocalized as Alvar had been as a cadet. But she knew she had always been calculating. The answers always seemed to come to Daiyu. What was the answer now? She gazed into the Ravelin City skylane traffic. The speeders seemed to move quite slowly at the distance she was away from them. There were also numerous turbolaser emplacements she noticed among the many of the skyscraper buildings. The buildings weren't of the highest aesthetic value, but it was designed with defense in mind. Nevertheless, the bustle of the High Culture of the Imperial Citizens was quite the inspiring thought nonetheless to help her gather her thoughts. That is, they weren't Sith-Imperials, a different creed from her own that she had followed. Similar in almost every way, except those above her charge used the Dark Side as their inspiration. And possibly to her discontent, she couldn't see the Oturis Academy from here. Nonetheless, meditation could prove invaluable. She stretched out with her feelings and felt a presence ascending up the stairs.... The Force flickered in her soul slightly....
*The Emperor.*
But...it was the Force...she felt a cold feeling crawl up her spine. Her senses were clouded....which Emperor? The heir or the current Emperor? What was the Force telling her?

### **zerah** (2012-11-27 19:10:41)

It was in moments like those from which she stood with the different beauty before her that her mind compared, that she looked at her life and wondered how things would have been different if, or what would have changed if...if...that was always the question wasn't it? But she hadn't come up there to think circles again, she came to clear her mind and find the answers that just had to be in front of her..it had to be...she always had the answers could always see the clear finish but this?
*calm…feel…*
She relaxed...let her feelings stretch, looked to the force for guideance, something she often wondered about as well...if she had stayed with Krayt, would he have trained her, to help her understand the things the force manages to tell her, would things have come easier...
a presence...up the stairs...ascending as she had...she listened, breathed, and...
*the Emperor..*
her brow furrowed, which Emperor? the one that was calm and wise but old? the female imposter of an heir that evoked such a strong feeling of resentment? the true heir that she loved?..or the dark one that still held something in her heart and soul?
She hated the force in these moments, she didn't understand! was this a literal thing?? figurative?? why would the Emperor be coming up stairs what would that mean?? a new being ascending to the throne? to life? new power? what!
*wait….
maybe this was literal.*
She spun to the stairs, body tense and reflexively moving into a defensive position, her back moving to face a statue as she waited.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-28 00:14:06)

A familiar voice echoed as Roan Fel emerged from the drafty stairwell. **"Admiring our architecture?"**. The Emperor walked past the Imperial, being ever cautious not to turn his back on her. It was simply bad protocol within the Imperial Knights to face away from those they talked to. The only time this was allowed was meditation. He didn't turn away from the Commodore, but look toward the peaceful hum of the skylane traffic. There was something quite soothing about people traveling, especially in airspeeders that never failed to calm the Emperor's nerves.
**"Forgive me, we have allowed the deliberations to draw on for a long time. In the tremendous weight of our negotiations I forgot to give you three well-needed respite."**
Commodore Daiyu flicked on the bluish glow of her Imperial issue chrono. It had automatically switched to Ravelin time....it was 0216.
**"However, if you will forgive me for being so forward. I have stated the terms and conditions to our alliance with your triumvirate. You did not hear them officially stated, but I hope your views coincide with ours. Again, I don't want you to undertake a burden you are not comfortable with."**
He took in a deep breath and stated the conditions. **"We've agreed to assassinate Lord Krayt, in hope of betterment for the galaxy. The Imperial Knights will act as the secondary initiative to the plan; you will serve as the primary effort to assassinate Lord Krayt. If you deem it necessary that it. My Knights stand ready to assist in the instance that you fail your task. The Council also asks for official schematics of the Death Star. If Lord Malificere does indeed usurp the throne, he will be required to report all matters of his dealings as leader of the Sith. He will be required to report all his dealings directly to me. I will assign three of my best Imperial Knights to oversee all matters regarding your Death Star as well. It is asking a lot, but  we feel it is necessary for galactic….."**
*"Daiyu, can you hear me?"*
It was strange, but she heard a voice in her head. The Emperor was continuing to talk but the words were inaudible. This…was the Force.

### **zerah** (2012-11-30 16:49:01)

So it was literal...
It was good that some instincts never left a person, though she found it interesting of his positions. True she had been lax in her study of Imperial Knights, but...it was curious.
It other context, the fact he ensured his back was not to her was a sign of ill ease, mistrust, even a fear for some...though she doubted it in him, but certainly a sense of defense, anticipation of attack. The fact he turned his head away but his body retained it's position told her he didn't believe her as a threat, or that she was of no worry; his posture was not so much relaxed but not...tense...like hers, he was not anticipating a fight.
He could be over taken if the need arose.
She, however, held her back to the statue, her body tense and her eyes never left him. She was on unfamilier ground, in a vulnerable state, and was taught and conditioned to take advantage of a situation if it would play to her favor.
She was a threat. She was dangerous. She could choose.
It was strange though, he seemed so...genuine. She was listening even as she was assessing bu-
*What?…* her head shifted, a faint tilt of the head to the side
*Who…*
Can she hear who?....did he stop talking? no...no his lips are moving... then who...
*Yes….I can hear you…who…who is this?*

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-30 17:10:11)

*It is I, your Father.*

### **zerah** (2012-11-30 18:41:57)

Well now that sort of halted all thought process.
How long had she been trying to get some kind of message or advice from him since his sudden appearance in her...dream? in Krayt's throne room? How long had it been that she had tried to get the damn holocron open, hoarding it, hiding it because it might, MIGHT, have more of him?
And suddenly he's talking to her...talking to her through the force...
what the hell.
where the hell had he been!?
Did he have any idea how much she could have used his advice?! could have used anything from him!?
....
No...calm down...he's dead...it's not like he can really help how he's able to communicate...or if it's really him and not someone playing some awful prank on her.
*How do I know it's really you? How…how are you even speaking to me?*

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-11-30 22:25:49)

*You know who this is. This ….is difficult…an eternity of suffering. I'm using all that I can to communicate, but it is torturing my soul.*
The Emperor studied the Commodore closely. "Searching the Force for your answer? I commend you because I sense no anger, passion, or fear in your technique."
He watched her as she had her back to the the Imperial Knight statues with clashing lightsabers. "I will admit you have brought a curious triumvirate to our Council on this day. Curious and interesting. The hours go dreadful with anticipation on this night. My knights await anxiously as your comrades seem deep in thought at the current plan. I hope you can make the right decision."
He folded his arms and squared his regal outfitted body to Daiyu. "Forgive the seemingly harsh nature of our negotiation process. We have put you under a lot of stress. May I get you something?"
A bronze protocol droid heard this and was cranking forward with its servo motors to attend to the Emperor's whim. Yet, Commodore Daiyu could still sense that presence. What did he mean by suffering? Was it that hard to send communication forward to the Commodore?

### **zerah** (2012-12-01 06:59:10)

Torture? no....no he...he shouldn't torture himself just to....to talk to her...no matter how much she wanted to hear his voice, to learn of the man she never knew.
*Don't torture yourself…that…I don't know the force but it shouldn't be…you shouldn't be in pain just to speak. Please just….just tell me this…Am I doing right? Are you alright? Are…are you proud of me?*
It was all she wanted to know...it would tell her so much. Her father was a Jedi, if he thought it was right to kill Krayt regardless how she might still feel about him then she knew...she knew that it would be what he would want for her...and pride; strange how important it was to her to know he was proud of her...like she wanted to make Master proud.
Distantly some part of her brain prodded at her that the Emperor was waiting for an answer, her mind supplying a brief rundown of what had been said. Instinct, training, unease, she didn't know what to really call it told her not to accept anything she didn't see made in front of her in this place; but, protocol, honor, the want of peace said to accept.
Something easy then.
"Tea…ah…light tea…please…" she said haltingly, he believed she was searching the force, let him continue that thought. "Cherry Blossom…do…um..do you have that?" it had become a favorite while she'd been with Krayt, she'd admit she'd been spoiled with new tea of any flavor she had wanted there, but that...had become her favorite.
A thought struck her as she stepped back more to put her back to something even semi solid before sinking to the ground. Folding her legs under her; awareness while meditating had come easy, meditating into the force had been hard; but she wondered.
It hurt him to come to her, to speak to her like this...could she follow the presence to him? Take the pain away but allow them the chance to speak? She had to try; she took her slow breathes mumbling faintly to the man "I'm still new at this…forgive me but this is easier…if…you will not mind granting me quiet." She deemed it a fair request. Maybe he'd even leave.
Her previous thought had her paying more attention to the presence in her head, Master had been like a father to her as well, but...this was to be her father...which father. She knew Master, knew his presence, was this him or...or Luke...
Focus...breathe...feel it out...who is it...
Breathe...relax...not too much, be aware...stretch to it...find it..

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-12-02 01:51:23)

The Emperor gave a genuine smile and responded with extreme courteousy. **"Of course. I will bid you your leave. I…too….need to tend to my meditations…as does the Council. It's actually a good initiative on your part. However, I must humbly request you and your comrades come to a decision soon. I'm sure you understand the reason behind this."**
The Emperor bowed his head as his velvet cloak enveloped the frontal part of his body partially. It was a deep bow. A sign of honor among enemies, and most likely for their common ground as followers of the Imperial Viewpoint. The Emperor left the observation platform that overlooked the High Cultured city of Ravelin.
Once everything was clear...Commodore Daiyu focused through the Force. She felt the Imperial Knights in the Council, and the Emperor descending the stairwell. Following that, she felt the dark and cold presence of Invictus and Malificere. It was like a shroud of suffering and pain that was clouding her feelings. Despite that, the voice broke through....
***"Daiyu…my most trusted daughter. You have suffered the trials and tribulations of your destiny and still stand strong. I haven't much time. I cannot give you the answers you seek. You have sought them for a long time, I know and I yearn to give them to you. But I rot in eternal suffering of the Dark Side, it procludes me from interfering in your life as much as we'd like. The Will of the Force is beyond mortal comprehension. I could tell you all the answers but you would not understand it…not until you've become one with the Force. I am Mikin Ristrin. I was but a guide to you and all my children's destiny. Now I can only give a warning despite the Dark Side tearing my soul asunder."***
The voice echoed in her head deeply, and Ristrin sounded ghastly and in great pain. That was the Dark Side.
***"You remember long ago you survived the Trials of Temple Atum Der Pietas (Sith language translation here). Alvar retrieved the lightsaber of the fallen Emperor. But it was stated, the one who possesses the Sword of Destiny shall shoulder the fate of galaxy. As long as someone possesses that, they possess the very keys of destiny. If you lose it, you lose the key of fate itself. If it happens to land in another’s keep, then their destiny has become yours. Keep it to your very soul, or lose it to oblivion. So, I'm issuing you a warning about Alvar. He has….fallen in love with his own legacy that was revealed to him. He believes the throne is his birthright and that all is already his. He has you at his side. Because of these facts, he has grown complacent and apathetic. I sense passion slipping from his very soul, a key component to utilizing the Dark Side which has been the very essence of his prosperity. Now Daiyu, your path is beginning to become clearer…..and I will leave you with this. The trials…that you bathed your souls in blood with…those trials that made you search desperately for YOUR existence. They are not over. Daiyu, you must step forward on your path, no matter the cost.”***

### **zerah** (2012-12-02 16:55:07)

Master...
It was Master...
She was both so happy to hear his voice again, to have heard him call her daughter, to say she was his loyal daughter...and saddened...not just because it was in death that he had acknowledged the relationship, but that it...it hadn't been her birth father.
*What were you thinking was going to happen really…Luke likely didn't know about you…or didn't want you. Vision be damned there's no proof that he would have wanted you, been proud…hell…he'd probably hate everything about you…no..not hate…Jedi don't hate.*
The thought made her heart hurt but she pushed the pain away, it wasn't needed...neither were those thoughts.
He couldn't even tell her he was proud? or what he thought was right? even in death he didn't hold straight answers.
She listened though, attentively as always, wanting to please, to belong...maybe that was were it all stemmed from; hiding from the other kids in the shadows, over confidence and all just because she wanted to belong? *psychoanalyze later.* She told herself and focused on the task at hand, he didn't have much time.
*Master…I don't understand, I'm so lost and the paths before me are vast! I do not know which to follow, both have such…such heavy losses…please…please Master I need guidance, I don't understand what the Force manages to tell me.*
*I don't want to make a mistake…
I don't want to fail…*
She couldn't bring the words out but...she couldn't fail...didn't want to lose those she loved, why..why did the trials continue..to what gain?

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-12-02 19:45:41)

Then, the nigh unbelievable happened. There stood a tall, handsome man in luminescent form. The hue to this spiritual appearance was a darkish blue/white and was quite ghastly. His hair was dark and his facial features clean and striking. He bore the Royal Crimson Robes of the Emperor's Guard, just like she had become. Her master had not looked this well at the time of his passing, there was no disfigurement to him at all. He hunched over slightly, but managed to let forth a smile and speak.
***"The paths before you are vast. That is why I was commanded to guide you from birth to these days. However, I am no longer your master. You have become a strong person. It is time for you to realize this. You must go forward and make decisions others cannot. Yes, there will be losses. But there will always be losses, even if you do nothing. The Will of the Force shall always take life away, but you do what you must to minimize chaos. You should fear mistakes and failure. It will give you strength. However, you cannot simply take no action in fear of these problems. Your weakness has always been fear to voice your very soul when it was needed most. Had your voice been respected, you would not be in this potentially volatile situation. You no longer require guidance. You are strong and capable. You are able to make decisions that would destroy lesser men. It is acceptable to seek advisement, but too much of another's input, and you lose who you are. There shall come a point in your life, when the voices of others shall only become a whisper to you…and you will act with complete resolve and poise. You will do all this….for the better. I have suffered an eternity to bring you this message. Even in life, I corrupted myself with the Dark Side to keep me alive long enough to see my children achieve greatness. But, I have suffered it for a reason. You have never disappointed me and you never will. Take your passion, and use it how your instincts command you to. My daughter, make your own path. Make your presence known in the Force."*** 
The soul of Ristrin began to slowly fade away after the words he had conveyed....and all that was left...was the bustling skylanes in the distance to remind Commodore Daiyu of life in the face of death she had witnessed...

---

### **zerah** (2012-12-02 21:51:47)

Daiyu stared, eyes wide at the image before her; she shouldn't stare, she knew that but...she had never seen him looks so healthy...even while looking so tortured.
It didn't matter that he wasn't her master anymore, he had always been master first, anything else second; she may not mean the title as she once had but it was still his title to her, his name, his meaning to her. He would always be master; teacher, general, father, harsh, calm, adoring, loving...he was so much but he was simply..Master.
It eased her, even as it made her breath hitch, hand sharply wiping away tears she hadn't realized had fallen, that he had told her to do as her heart...as her soul spoke. To make herself be heard and do what she believed was best...follow her own path...respect the losses to come and minimize them to the greatest degree.
He faded back into the force, and she was left feeling....feeling what?
*Light…I feel…lighter.* 
Doubts lifted away, fears diminished and all because someone she respected had just told her...to do what was best, and to follow herself. She'd been following others for so long, so long screaming to be heard and being ignored, forced to watch and take part in actions that were wrong in so many ways and for what?
But how could she...
*I…I love him…I do…how can I do that to him? It's the best choice. It is. It would minimize everything, voices would be heard, damage could be controlled…lots of things could be controlled after.*
How could she face him though? the guilt...it would eat at her...
*Thank you Master….you…you've helped more than you know…I hope. I will make you proud. Please…rest, be at ease…find the light.*
She breathed deeply then, closed her eyes and dived into herself, meditating for calm even as she listed, planned, thought, weighed. Find the light. Find the path that is best.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-12-02 23:42:21)

As Daiyu stretched out with her feelings, she could no longer feel the presence of Ristrin. What was even more peculiar was the fact he mentioned he was *commanded* to raise her and the other orphans in the barren wastelands of Yinchorri. Who would have the authority to order such a a course of action? It was certainly something to think about....even more so with the pleortha of thoughts Daiyu most likely had running through her head.
Even more so at the moment, the Imperial Knights were awaiting a decision for their alliance and plans to move against the Sith Lord. Daiyu checked her chrono and noted it was 0312. The standard day cycle was 24 hours here, so it was very late by this planet's standards. Not that she might mind the difference, as there is no sun within the girth of a Star Destroyer. She was used to long hours, but she had grown quite tired. The time for some sort of action was drawing near. It was likely the Imperial Knights wouldn't like the Sith just wandering about their headquarters with no plan or intended course of action.

### **Maldoravia** (2012-12-06 19:00:32)

Maleficere had had enough as far as time for him to think. He looked up from his position and gave a sigh before nodding his head. "I accept the terms as far as what His Highness has set before us. I apologize for how long it has taken me to ponder things, I also apologize for how I may have sounded earlier." He arose from his seat, stretched his arms and neck before regaining his seated position. "Let it be known, here and now, that whatever your plans are...concerning myself will be carried out however you wish. We will give you the original plans to the Death Star, so long as you provide the resources...should the need for them arise." He looked over at Daiyu before tilting his head...confused at...something, but quickly forgot as he turned and looked to the others present. "Seeing as I am Admiral, let me make this quick by saying that my decision and commitment extends to those that I lead. We hereby pledge our loyalty, to you." Really he had no allusion that things would be so simple...in fact he half heatedly expected someone to try and dispute his willingness. He had to smirk at that though...the idea. Someone trying to tarnish his name? He could live with that...maybe even perhaps forgive the action. However if someone were to question or impugn his honor...Well...That would not be a pretty happening, regardless of whether he was a match for those present or not.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-12-07 00:40:36)

The Council began to stir at Malificere's counter-offer. Princess Marasiah Fel stepped forward and announced they must wait for their Emperor to return before making a decision. After 15 minutes or so, he returned, a thoughtful look on his face. His conversation with Daiyu had stricken him into deep thought. A council member went up to the Emperor as he took his seat on the throne. The Emperor looked at Lord Malicifere and then spoke to his fellow Knights.
**"Let it be known Knight Ibsen that the Council recognizes Lord Malificere's motion for resources to construct the Third Death Star in exchange for our assistance to assassinate Darth Krayt. Therefore, let us pass judgment on this issue."**
The Council members spoke for about five minutes, and the Princess made sure to overlook the proceedings. All the while, a protocol droid was refilling the Sith emissaries glasses with light tea. Knight Ibsen hastily but skillfully composed a chit for the Emperor to review and hurried to his throne with a bow. The Emperor read the scroll and rubbed his chin...he seemed less tired than before. The benefits of Force Meditation were immense, the Sith guessed that's what he had been doing. The Emperor then spoke.
**"It is the findings of this Council….and of myself….that we recognize your motion for resources for your Superweapon. However, we disagree with this motion and will not proceed on that course of action."**
The Emperor took a moment to think and squared his shoulders up while sitting on his throne. **"While we recognize the tactical advantage of having one of the most fearsome Superweapons ever devised. We know that it will be under your control. We appreciate and honor your pledge of loyalty, but you have not earned our affinity enough to garner such resources from us. Do not digress however. We still wish to honor our original agreement and destroy Lord Krayt. How do you wish to proceed?"**
The Knights looked at Lord Malificere boldly. As an Admiral, usually when people disagreed with him they might look away or show signs of hesitance. It was customary in any diplomatic setting. These men and women were warriors of principle....ready to die at milliseconds notice for their cause. But these....Knights....were different. They were empty, with no fear. They were steadfast in their decision. The Imperial Knights wouldn't give up their resources to construct the Death Star and they showed no signs of deferring from that tangent. The air was tense and the torches lit the drafty room of the grand council chamber, and awaited Malificere's response.

The image of a female faded from view as Niles turned off the holoprojector. His orders were clear and he wasted no time in carrying them out. With a satisfying swish the door to the bridge opened and he strolled inside taking up his customary position overlooking a star chart. Fishing around in his jacket pocket, Niles pulled out a metallic flask and took a swig from it. Stashing it away once more, he grimaced as he swallowed, allowing the contents to make it's way into his digestive system.
*'Yeeessshh that's cold….'* He thought to himself rubbing his teeth to numb the discomfort. Beckoning the bridge crew over, he addressed them:
**"Crew as you heard from Captain Torvitt's communique, it's very odd for us to be this close to Bastion without a plan of attack. As always expect the unexpected and ready yourselves for anything."** With a wave of his hand he dismissed them back to their stations asking his comms expert to stay put.
**"Ready the communication array to send out a burst transmission to the surface. We're to address our superiors."**
His ensign scurried off and a few moments later gave him a thumbs up signalling that the Commander's transmission was ready to be sent out. Reconnaissance missions had been the crew's tour de force over the past years so sending a message to some comlinks on a planets surface should be no problem. Clearing his throat he spoke once more:
*****"My Lords, this is Commander Wellesley-Thorpe of the Frigate *Frontier*. Could you kindly provide us with a status report of the current situation. The crews are concerned with these *unorthadox* tactics."*****
Drumming his fingers on the rim of the holographic projector of the star map, he eagerly awaiting their response.

((*By the way as to explain Niles' return, after his performance review back on the Adjudicator years ago he requested transfer. Rather or not Alvar agreed Moff Tayus gave him the green light to move to a smaller Frigate scout ship that was apart of Alvar's fleet. Commander Niles' commanded the ship and was at the Battle of Dac. His ship managed to survive the Battle as he ran only into light resistance. We know the Adjudicator was destroyed. But it would be curious as to why Moff Rain Tayus would be so enthusiastic to change his duty station upon request.*))

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-12-14 02:02:31)

Commander Niles sat in his bridge chair. The ship was similar in look to the Adjudicator on the interior, as all bulk-Imperial vessels were, but the function and the exterior were quite different. The bridge on this particular ship, had no crew pits in which the Commander could look over all of the bridge personnel...rather it all the bridge stations were on the same floor as the Captain's chair. He could look over towards any member of the crew at any station at all times, which seemed more practical. But Niles' likely figured that the overlooking bridge design of the Imperial Star Destroyers and above were more symbolic than functional. On those craft you always had to look up at the Commander. On this bridge, you saw eye to eye with all personnel. Also unlike the bridges of other Capital class vessels, the bridge was at the forefront of the vessel, rather than elevated at the aft of the ship. It gave the helmsman some advantages when maneuvering, serving well as a scout vessel with evasiveness. Commander Niles' likely did not mind all the differences of this as he had served well on this vessel called the *Frontier.* It was a forward scouting vessel for the Legate Fleet, and it usually went ahead of Admiral Alvar's flagship to gather intelligence. However, this time was different. The Admiral had taken his own initiative. He was here to investigate that notion.
His reputation as a highly respected intelligence and science officer had preceded him to the arrival on the *Frontier.* The crew of 130, while small compared to a Star Destroyer, greatly respected him. Also, his experience in such a technical field had served him well as a Commander of this vessel. He thought of the current dilemmas the Legate Fleet was undergoing. *Moff Alexander Kane rumored dead, the effect it could have on the Raiballo Sector, Project WA-3, the Admiral becoming a Sith, rumors of Commodore Daiyu close to Darth Krayt, and two powerful space stations called the Star Forge laid in wait. Where was his career going as he was caught in the middle of this?*
Lieutenant Commander Pami Krael interrupted the Commander's thoughts as he viewed the Star Map projection. She had served by his side diligently. This female officer was quite the attractive person, as was typical to all female Imperial Officers for some reason. Maybe it had something to do with the secret order of the Firebird Society? If it still existed. However, she had styled short-red hair and fine ivory skin. Her hair was swayed in the front to give you just the right look at her green eyes. She reported with arms folded behind her back, dressed in Imperial black.
***"Sir, are efforts to get through to the three leaders of the Vindicator are failing. The communications array is having trouble with interference at this range.**"*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, in the Imperial Knight's High Audience Chamber....both Sith Lord's comlinks began to chirp...and the Knight Council looked at the emissaries carefully. Rand Ko spoke diligently, knowing Malificere had a choice to make. ***"Can that wait? Or is there something you should tell us?"***

Niles let out a sigh as he ran his hands through his hair, which had now started to grey whether due to the stresses associated with command or age he didn't know. He had contemplated dying it in the past but quickly dismissed the idea.
**"Nothing's ever easy is it, Pami."** He said pushing himself upright, addressing his attractive second in command. **"Standard procedure: Bring us in closer and divert power from our *weapons* to the communications array…and see if we can isolate that interference."** The loadout on the *Frontier* was nothing compared to what Lightus had had at his fingers back on his previous ship, but it did the job, especially with such a competent crew wielding it.
The Chiss' mind was aflame as thoughts burned around it: *'What are they up to down there and where do I fit into the big picture? Do I have a part to play in the grand scheme or am I just another pawn on the table of a Sith? A Sith? Or THE Sith? The seem to multiply quicker than bacteria.'* He paced around the map before wandering over to the comms station enquiring if his suggestions were of any use or if they'd need to try something more drastic? The safety of the crew was of paramount importance to him and he would always prefer to air on the side of caution before throwing them in front of a barrage of turbolaser fire.

The daze she'd entered within making her lists within her head, the pros and the cons, the weight of the choices, was broken by a faint chirp outside her mind.
It happened again when she tried to ignore it, then again as her eyes slowly slid open, what the hell was that sound?
"oh!' she gasped hands flying to her com, daze broken in a snap and she was back to herself, feeling the cool air and the hard ground. She took a moment to clear her throat and take a breathe before speaking "Daiyu." she stated simply into the com, curious who would be contacting her on the plant.

### **jaybee3** (2012-12-19 06:24:52)

A single word blurted abrasively though the speaker in his chair's communication panel: *"Daiyu…"*
**"Ma'am, this is Commander Thorpe of the *Frontier*, we kindly request a status update and an explanation as to why we are so close to an enemy stronghold without any plans of attack, or for that matter encountered any resistance….as of yet."** He spoke calmly and clearly, something that years of telecommunication mishaps had taught him. He had dropped the first barrel of his surname, as certain crewmates couldn't get past the first few syllables and only used it when it was absolutely necessary - Entertaining guests, politicians or diplomats at the rare Officer soiree. The name coupled with his charm helped convince most that he was one of them.
Flicking the terminal to mute, he ushered Pami over and awaited a reply.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-12-19 17:16:46)

Lieutenant Commander Pami Krael stood rigid as she was addressed by her Commander. She awaited her orders, with not even the slightest hint of indiscipline. It was true, Commander Niles had seen his dozen officers aboard the bridge of the *Frontier* and they were definitely skilled. He would put their expertise against the crew of the *Adjudicator* if it still existed. He was even willing to bet they were better off than the *Vindicator.* They unquestionably followed his orders at all times. And seldom was the time he had to double check navigational routes, firing calculations, or scientific data. They never failed him in the operations of this vessel. This was unlike the bridge he worked on in the *Adjudicator.*
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Please note, the crew's performance is reflected in the stats of the Frontier. Because of Niles' leadership stats that he has earned, the crew performs better...just like all other PC's.

Daiyu stared at her com for a moment, her brow furrowed *Commander Thrope?* she pondered, why did that name...
It hit her rather hard, hard enough that she physically recoiled as though hit.
"Niles?" she questioned for a moment in surprise, she couldn't help it really, she hadn't heard from him since he took leave of the ship before....before everything. She'd kept tabs on him sure but to hear from him? this was...
*What in the hell was he doing here.*
She rubbed her head for a moment and thought, how best to do this? she didn't know what was going on in the conference with Alvar and Invictus, just as they didn't know what was going on in her head. So...how exactly to say what was going on without..saying what was going on.
Hm...that was a conundrum...
She started a few times, trying to come up with the words before finally sighing, and throwing a hand in the air "Continuing the tradition of Master's tests and forms friendly conversation." Well it was mostly true really, by being on the planet in a friendly manner they'd gotten inside, know what their knights are like, heard the balances from both sides of the tables, tested them against each other to see who's loyalty is on what side of the force, viewed the Emperor to establish an opinion based upon fact and not propaganda and all in all...continue with Master's plans for their destiny.
She wondered briefly as she thought that all over, if she had realized she had been doing it or if it just came to her that she had been, and wondered if he'd understand in the long run, or if he'd get that this was something better discussed in person or on a very secured channel.
It also came upon her that...he had no ties...if ever she could bounce the ideas off of someone now that Janelle was gone it could be him, he'd listen at least...help her to figure out her own head. That was a thought.
She stood from her position and waited for a response while she stretched, it was far past time to leave. She needed to find out what they had agreed to and then get back to the ship. There were plans to make.

The Lieutenant Commander gave a quizzical look to her commanding officer. "Master's tests?" She said in an inquisitive but respectful tone.

Invictus had let Malificere run the negotiations single-handedly long enough he decided. While he did appreciate at all times the man's drive to lead the situation head-first he would often run straight into a metaphysical wall with a sore spot on his head afterwards.
He joined the negotiations with an air about him that insisted he had been in charge of things the whole time and had only chosen to intervene now because he wished to hurry things along.
**"I propose another arrangement for assistance in building the death star then. We have the holocron detailing the original plans of the death star and you wish to make sure this weapon never comes to fruition in sith hands. I can assure you that if we are defeated the death star will fall into sith hands and without it our chances are that much lower, and that much higher for the enemy. Instead of a flat-out ban on the idea I would suggest a treatise of sorts. We modify the death star to have not one, but three necessary firing stations in order for the primary assault cannon to function. Without the authorization of Malificere, Roan Fel, and leader of the Knights, the weapon will not function. Furthermore, after the coup is completed, should we attain victory, I submit that we voluntarily split the original blueprints into three separate sections on three separate holocrons. Withholding any part of blueprints that are not yours will be a crime punishable as the other two parties see fit."**
He finished his proposition with a gesture to the three main parties standing there, the Fel's, the knights, and the sith, with a final look at Malificere for approval. He knew the knights would never agree to be left out of an agreement between two emperors when the balance of the universe, and the entire force with it, was at stake, and neither of the emperors would see fit to be considered a minor party either.
**"Not only will it create an equalizer among all wars, but it will create a reason to unite under one banner should we face a galactic threat such as the Vonduun again"**.
He makes his last point and then seems to take a step back without actually doing so, his presence almost immediately withdrawing to be an observer again and see how his proposition stands with the people who liked to think they were in charge

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-23 16:50:48)

The Emperor listened to the plan concocted by Darth Invictus and smiled slightly. He shifted in his throne and then spoke in his regal voice to cut over the chatter of the Imperial Knights.
"It seems this was better than the original plan you had offered us. By my power that I humbly wield for the betterment of the Empire, I agree with your terms for our alliance. Knight Ibsen will make the official proceedings with each member of the Sith party to make the alliance legal. I commend you in compromising in this manner so that we may forward in our mission together."
Princess Marasiah Fel looked over the Knights, it seemed that most of the Knights were not in favor of this motion. "You're far too trusting of these Sith. Even if they do not call themselves so…this is too trusting to anyone with such a weapon."
"I understand your concern my daughter. However, they are very strong in the Force. There is also something quite unique about their abilities that I do not yet understand. I would prefer them in alliance with us. If we imprisoned them or worse I fear that the Death Star plans would still be left available to someone else. It is best we are proactive towards such a construct such as this Superweapon."
Knight Rand Ko muttered something under his breath that had the word "execution" in it, but you could not quite catch the entire gist of it.
"Now, if you do not mind, please step forward to Knight Ibsen where he will handle the official proceedings to make this alliance legal. Might I remind you, any breach of the official contract and you are officially designated an enemy in which we will make top priority in dealing with. I look to the Force to hope that this isn't necessary."
The Sith and Commodore Daiyu went over the official documentation. It authorized a minimum of two or more Imperial Knights, including the Emperor, to be onboard the Death Star at all times...or even an army if they so wished it. It also expands upon Invictus' proposal where the Knights and Roan Fel possess two out of three means to prevent the weapon from firing without their authorization. Only the two Sith would sign an elegant flimsiplast and leave their audioprint for voice recognition. *((All PC's are in agreement for purposes of advancing the story. Otherwise any player can go back and retcon agreement to the official deal.))* Commodore Daiyu refused to sign or leave her audioprint for any such contract of alliance.
After all the two Sith pledged their commitment to the plan. The Emperor had a solemn look to his face. "It is now 0336. We appreciate your diligent efforts through these negotiations. In approximately eight hours, we will see you back in this audience chamber for the operation to kill Darth Krayt. Your accommodations for your rest period will be provided by my Knights, and you will be supervised…..unfortunately. After the planning phase is complete, we will move immediately to destroy Darth Krayt. The sooner the better, as I fear he may realize two of his Sith have not reported in."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After eight hours of rest in a luxurious sleeping chamber, a Knight wakes each of you three up....and escorts you back to the audience chamber. There, it was obvious the Imperial Knights had not slept at all...maybe a Force Trance....but they had definitely not slept. They had a pile of flimsiplast books and space maps with various waypoints charted. Emperor Roan Fel was making it a point to directly oversee every little detail of the intelligence that had been gathered. He was that serious about destroying one man. Knight Rand Ko approached the three and escorted them to the well-organized clutter of intelligence documents. "**I trust you slept well….**" with a slight sneer in his voice. **"Here is what we need from you…"** As he said this, it was obvious that he did not trust Commodore Daiyu. But she was being watched more closely than the Sith now, security was even more on edge than when they originally arrived here. Nevertheless, The Emperor was determined to see to the death of Darth Krayt.
*((Below is the skill challenge necessary to benefit you in the assault against Lord Krayt. Each player may roll for whatever skill they wish to. However, it is first come, first serve. If you fail a skill check, it is a failure for the entire party, and may be redeemed by another.*
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">OPERATION ZETA SEVEN</span>
Knowledge Galactic Lore or Use the Force Skill Check.
Knight Rand Ko shows you a checklist of issues that must be considered before executing your half of the plan. The first one is how to handle Lord Krayt sensing an thoughts of maliciousness emanating from Commodore Daiyu.
Knowledge Technology
Rand Ko points out the issue who should make contact with Darth Krayt, and if you had any ideas if he possessed the countermeasures to assesses whether or not his communication signal could be traced.
Persuasion
Rand Ko also needs reassurance that whoever contacts Darth Krayt they are more than capable of possessing enough cunning in their speechcraft as to not spoil any ideals of them taking aggressive action towards Darth Krayt.
*Knowledge Tactics*
Rand Ko has a general idea for the plan. But needs a further detailed one from the Sith and Daiyu who will be the primary initiative to assassinate Krayt. How will Daiyu actually assassinate Krayt and how will she put him in a vulnerable position to kill him?
*Knowledge Tactics*
How will your fleet be used in this instance? Rand Ko advises you this could become a full fledged Naval skirmish.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recovery: Since they have heard of Alvar’s silver tongue and gallantry in battle, a check he succeeds on 5 or more can remove a failure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Success: The heroes convince Imperial Knights their plan will be sound. The plan will actually be efficient. (Thus, granting bonus effects towards rolls associated to certain instances in the assassination attempt.)
Failure: The Imperial Knights will still commit to the assassination despite the flaws in your planning, however you the risk in the operation will be greater to you depending upon which skill checks are failed..---------------
*You may roll all of the skill checks if you want. That is, one player may attempt all the skill checks if they wish. If the skill challenge takes longer than 2 days, the storyline will be advanced to the actual operation, either negating, granting little benefit, or granting little disadvantage to the operation. If no players participate, no benefits or disadvantages will be granted. However, influence will be lost with the Imperial Knights. Again, in two days from now the operation will commence regardless of participation in the skill challenge.*

Daiyu had rather been on auto for the rest of the meeting, mind both going a mile a minute and moving at a crawl. Clearing barely long enough to retain focus when she refused to sign before returning to it's strange pace. If they wanted to know they could ask later dammit.
It wasn't a pleasant feeling. It really wasn't, she felt drugged really...maybe that was just from lack of sleep. Which didn't help things as even after retiring to the guest room she'd been allowed she sat in the corner of the room, blanket wrapped around her and dozed for 30 minutes before starting awake for an hour, the process repeating until she was woken up feeling like she hadn't slept at all.
which...really she hadn't. Hard to with so much on her mind, and her dreams....
the first had been of Alvar, on the throne and she has his right hand who followed his orders but...wasn't allowed an opinion.
The next had been Krayt, sitting on his throne in front of delegates and she in his lap of all places, completely relaxed and leading the conversation while he simply looked on amused.
The third...the third she woke from screaming and crying, it was Krayt again and they were in the garden, he was on one knee, putting a ring on her finger. she was so happy...and then his eyes went wide, blood spilled from his mouth and he fell to the side showing the knife in his back...and the killer was her...one who looked dead in the eyes, robotic in movements. 'Traitor' he had called her 'Betrayer' and had asked if it had been worth it.
She didn't sleep for an hour and half after that one; she didn't dream after it either, just of a calming blue light.
She was on edge when she was woken again and led to the room, dark circles under her eyes and a twitch at every noise at her back. so really, it was forgivable that when Rand Ko had that sneer when asking about the sleep that she had glared blaster fire at him, and the urge and the thought to stab him in the heart...no..strangle...yes...strangle that throat of his and watch the life drain out of his. Perfectly forgivable.

It was clearly evident the Imperial Knights were watching over the Commodore. There was a brilliant blue HoloNet display of Coruscant and it's detailed topography on display, but some Knights looked straight through the imagery to the Commodore. Emperor Roan Fel remained focused on the mission, but it was likely he had ordered his men to not let Daiyu out of her sight. Emperor Roan Fel knew the risks he was dealing with. A potentially rogue ally, and two Sith who had made a plan in an unstable fashion. But the Emperor knew Krayt was too much of a threat, and if they could get close enough to him...the Sith would be severely crippled. These Sith also had proclaimed access to the plans of a Death Star. It was possible Roan Fel had taken the mentality of "keep your enemies closer." The planning phase was near it's final minutes.
What could the Sith offer? What could they possibly concoct on the galaxy's most horrendous enemy?

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-26 00:31:08)

Commodore Daiyu had just returned from the *Vindicator* back to the Imperial Knight Palace. She opened the large duracrete doors to the Knights looking studiously at the Coruscant streets; structures, undercities, and sublevels into important buildings such as the Senate Chamber and the Galactic Executive Chamber. They were scanning anything that might prove to be valuable intelligence based on what they had for Operation Zeta Seven. Emperor Roan Fel was making a note on a HoloNet way point when Daiyu caught his attention. But the Sith had heard the Imperial Knights speak it would be an extreme tactical disadvantage to conduct the operation on Coruscant, but current intelligence pointed that's where he spent most of his time.
**"So, you've made contact with Darth Krayt? Have you arranged a meeting?"**
Commodore Daiyu turned to the Knights and confirmed she would have a rendezvous with Darth Krayt at the Coruscant Jedi Temple as soon as she arrived.
There was a feeling of apprehension that gripped the Imperial Knight Audience Chamber. Their worries had been confirmed. The operation would take place in the Sith's most fortified position. Emperor Roan Fel looked at his Knights and asked what the Sith had devised in their efforts to assassinate Krayt.
The initial plan presented by the Sith had a lot of potential. It was to utilize the Commodore to get close to Darth Krayt and then kill him when he was at a relaxed posture. Other than that, the Sith were able to offer little more than knowledge of Krayt's personality and his security measures. As the Knights discussed the strategies it was becoming painfully and embarrassingly evident that Malificere's tactical knowledge was not offering much. There was no question this would arise the Imperial Knight's suspicion even more.
The planning continued, and some even considered the plan be aborted. Some of the most tactically sound Imperial Knights, Treis Sinde, advised against carrying out this operation. Their reasoning being that only the Sith agreed to the alliance authorization, and Daiyu refrained. It would be considered ludicrous to trust her to kill Darth Krayt as her commitment seemed to be unstable. It was nearly unanimous against the operation. But then the Emperor spoke.
**"I understand your concerns with this mission. Any other time, I would agree with my Council of my most trusted comrades. However, there is something unique about Commodore Daiyu. I cannot place my finger on it. But she has a presence in the Force that is similar to someone I've met before. She *must* be trusted. I can sense it through the Force. It is the Will of the Force that she commits to this operation and the Imperial Knights will support her."**
There it was, an assertion to the mission's success by the Emperor's usage of the Force. It was hard for the Knights to digest such a plan, but he was in command. It was extremely difficult in any case, when someone so attuned to the Force proclaimed the Will of the Force deemed a course of action to be true. There were still objections to the plan, but the Emperor faced about to the stained glass windows of the Imperial Knights shining in the morning sun of Bastion.
**"So with that being said, I will not ask for your support. Commodore Daiyu shall meet with Darth Krayt. Myself and the two other Sith will find a place to remain indiscriminate and concealed. I will not endanger my own Knights for my belief in the Force. But in the event that Darth Krayt cannot be killed by Commodore Daiyu, myself and the other two Sith will ensure the task is accomplished. These two Sith alone are no match for Krayt, but with my help we may be able to kill him. We'll gather whatever blueprints we can on the Jedi Temple, and use them to execute a quick insertion attack and exfiltration if it is required. We will get clear of any authorities via the Undercity, and then signal for extraction."**
The Emperor then looked to Commodore Daiyu. **"Again, obviously most of the danger rests upon your shoulders. Even if you fail, we will have to be at a considerable distance to avoid security and Darth Krayt's senses. The Sith around me should be able to cloud his judgment. But if not, we may not be able to support you at all. You must take all haste to escape if your assassination attempt fails."**
The Knights were obviously very displeased. They could easily lose their most trusted leader in this unorthodox and very dangerous plan. But then again, it could have an extreme tactical benefit if Krayt was destroyed. But, The Emperor continued to assert how important Daiyu was to the Force, and this needed to happen. He might come off as aged to some of the Knights, but they would unquestionably follow his orders. It was the Imperial way....duty to the end. He had not failed them yet, and Darth Krayt had just committed genocide. More atrocities had to be stopped. The Imperial Knights began concluding the planning phase, and began preparations for transport. The critical confrontation and the painful unease of the time waiting until that moment, were on the horizon.
*Influence lost with the Imperial Knights, affecting comraderie should you do battle at their side.*

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-26 01:12:30)

The trio of Sith-Imperials returned to the bridge of the Vindicator. Darth Malificere had an evil glow to his eyes and the crew was wondering what was going on. Captain Torvott nervously approached the Sith who seemingly did not want to be disturbed, and utter fear was now cast upon the crew by Invictus and Malificere who seemingly had terrible intentions that had the command crew wracked with nervousness. Captain Torvott tried to mutter some sort of tactful question, but Malificere just retorted with a simple and intimidating command. **"Follow the Imperial Knights' Fleet."**
Captain Torvott could not believe his ears. But, after a few moments, the glistening luminescent lights and dark blue hull of a Super Star Destroyer illuminated in the viewport. There were also three Pellaeon Class Destroyers in formation beside it. Captain Torvott looked to his crew for help, but they were looking down at their system consoles... it was obvious they were avoiding this ugly confrontation. **"Yes Lord Malificere. Set sensors to track their Cronau Radiation and plot our coordinates to track them in hyperspace and intercept."**
There were a number of questions going through the crew's heads...this mission was being kept hush hush. Darth Invictus kept a vigilant eye on all of the command crew, as he knew they were really the only ones who would know what was going on. He loomed over their shoulders like a menacing shadow of the Dark Side he embodied. They dare not do any operation other than ensuring the *Vindicator* ran smoothly in hyperspace. The *Frontier* was also following Malificere's Star Destroyer, as it was in his fleet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">137.2 ABY</span>**
All the ships came out of hyperspace with no system in visual range. However, the helmsman reported they were in the Coruscant system. Darth Malificere made a private communication with Emperor Roan Fel and arranged for a Sith transponder Nune Shuttle to travel to Coruscant's surface. Darth Malificere also ordered all of the Command crew to come with them, as he had an important clandestine mission for them to carry out. Out of sheer intimidation, they reluctantly followed The Sith. Once aboard the Nune shuttle to the surface, the command crew was looking oddly at Emperor Roan Fel. He was in shabby clothing, and had messed his hair up to look like a homeless Coruscant dweller. Captain Torvott was looking at him, but Invictus shot him a killing glaze. The Captain then looked to check on the Pilot's heading. Commodore Daiyu sense in the Force was telling her the command crew were completely nervous. They had no idea what was going on, why they were going to Coruscant, and why they had been following an Imperial Knight fleet. Nevertheless, the awkward hour of flight time continued until the brilliant view of Coruscant was in the viewport.
Captain Torvott tried to keep his military demeanor, adjusting his uniform to make it presentable. He always had his dignity. "Distinction and Honor", words to live and die by in the Empire. During a thorough HoloNet procedure from Coruscant ground control, Commodore Daiyu identified herself and the two Sith. She stated she had urgent business with Lord Krayt. Everything checked out fine. The mission had entered phase 1. Infiltration.
The Nune Shuttle chose an indiscreet spot were there were various skyscrapers with a thick gathering of industrial fog beneath them. It was a good distance from the Jedi Temple, it was nowhere in sight. This was the Imperial Knight's plan obviously. Infiltrate far away from heavy security via the Undercity. If there were any trouble down there, it would likely be the local gangs who were of nothing to worry about. The pilot checked his sensors carefully as he descended into the thick, brown fog. As it appeared, not all of Coruscant was a sight to behold. They landed somewhere in a deep starship junkyard. There were various "levels" to Coruscant and this was one just slightly above the Undercity.
Once the landing was complete, Malificere ordered the Command Crew to follow him. Again, they knew nothing of what was going on. Roan Fel had let his beard grown out, and looked very shabby/dirty. He presented a datapad showing the route to the Jedi Temple via the sewers of the Undercity. That was the route he and the Sith would be taking. They would position themselves underneath the vast and complex structures of Coruscant, but close enough to the Jedi Temple were they could find a turbolift to get to the Temple or however they could. The Emperor asked the Commodore to keep her comlink on at all times, so that they may monitor her communications. Also, he requested she carry a tracking device on her. The tracking device information would be relayed back to the Imperial Knight Fleet. He handed her some credits and told her to order a taxi speeder to the Jedi Temple.
**"We will be monitoring you for your safety at all times. May the Force be with you. Again, if matters go awry, don't be afraid to escape. We will try to find the best route to the Jedi Temple via the Undercity, but I can give you no estimate on how fast we can respond to an emergency. We won't know until we're in place and that might take some time. May the Force be with you Commodore, and remember….Sith possess the silver tongue to achieve their most evil desires. Do not underestimate the powers of the Dark Side. Its power is something that cannot be truly comprehended until it is experienced. Darth Krayt will use the Dark Side, he always does."**

Those had been Commodore Daiyu's parting words as she made her way from the junkyard to the more populated areas of the city. She watched as the other three found a worn down turbolift console and called for it...departing into the rough Undercity for their infiltration. She saw some very weird species mulling about in the streets. Coruscant bore a multitude of odd looking species, some even grotesque. Some were even trying to sell her death sticks. Nevertheless, she signaled for a taxi at the edge overlooking the Undercity. The taxi driver seemed quite professional, and within moments she was back into the fresh air of the upper levels of Coruscant. In minutes, she was in the political hub and heart of Coruscant. All the familiar capital buildings were in sight. It included the Jedi Temple, in which she had confronted Darth Krayt once before, and where their life had forever changed.
She excused the Taxi Driver and began walking up the long ceremonial stairway of the Jedi Temple. The large statues flanking her like ominous Gods. She was received by some stormtroopers, and they escorted her to the central spire turbolift to the very top of the Jedi Temple. It was Darth Krayt's most fond place to meditate, the Jedi High Council Chamber. He had refashioned it to have one singular throne, almost identical to the Old Jedi Council's chairs. Once she arrived in the ominous and peaceful room of the Jedi Temple, Darth Krayt was there....sitting in his throne. His chin was resting on his hand. But something was peculiar. There was another throne positioned exactly opposite of his. Commodore Daiyu had heard of the Council chamber before in her studies, and it bore twelve seats for the twelve Jedi Masters. Last time there was only one seat, and that was for Krayt. Now there was a second one in front of the circular symbol of artwork upon the finely polished floor.
**"Do you like it? I had it specially made for you. I figure it necessary for the future Empress. My most trusted voice. The ONLY voice in my Council."** Darth Krayt rose from his chair mightily and stepped forward, his blackened armor thudding the floor with authority. **"I heard you had an urgent proceeding with one of the Moff's near the Ziost system…how did that fare? But more importantly…how are you? What did you have to tell me?"**
The ebony and sinister looking helmet hid most of his facial features. But it did not hide his right orange eye and left blue eye. They were eyes seasoned by seeing anything that anybody could possibly imagine. Yet, he managed a slight smile for the Commodore.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, Emperor Fel; dressed as a homeless Coruscanti, was now trudging through the slimy and gooey black ooze of the Undercity sewers. He was walking behind the Sith, guiding them with his datapad to the appropriate location. **"Watch yourselves for Kouuhuns, they like to dwell down here. There bite is lethal. Keep your senses attuned. But also focus on the Dark Side. Your presence of the Dark Side should conceal my presence in the Force to Darth Krayt."**
Then, he heard the comlink of Krayt and Daiyu conversing. He asked the two Sith to stop. **"Do you hear that? They've made contact. She's in. What do you think she is going to do?"**

Daiyu had been lost in her thoughts, doing her damned best to shield them...better still to let her mind run that mile a minute process just to keep others from seeing everything. So much to do, so little time, so little knowing if it's right.
The return home, to the Vindicator was a blessing to her, the feel of the ships air on her skin, the sound of her crew...it was a balm to her nerves. and then everyone became nervous. She wanted to tell the sith to get off her bridge, that they were making her crew nervous, she wanted time to talk to her crew dammit, without them near by. But she couldn't. There wasn't enough time...so what to do then?
Retreating to her room she pet her little munyip, meditated on masters saber and her holocron and then decided on a course of action. Grabbing a blank datapad she started typing; she couldn't talk to her crew without witnesses but she could do something. So she typed, explained what was going on, explained her hesitation, explained as much as she could. And then gave them a plan. There was the chance she'd find it in herself to kill him, find some way to live with the guilt. But then there was a part of her that spoke up, that brought up the memory and the images of the emperor pouring over everything about Krayt, the obsessive behavior, the need to kill him to better the galaxy...but Krayt had never really expressed an interest in the same...no he wanted to better the galaxy through fear and intimidation, but wrong in different ways but...he could be changed...the emperor? she didn't think he could. So who then was evil? no..not evil, who was the worse option.
When the dropped from hyperspace, she changed into the more casual uniform, light clothing and darker colors, just in case. In the shuttle she pretended to go over the datapad, adding more, and more still as Fel told the plan. And then she added the last, she'd destroy her com if things changed, if she decided on the best course, and that would be for her crew. They would retreat from the others, and make way back to the shuttle and get back to the ship to wait. She would not risk her crew for a fool's mission if there's a better way.
Before he exited the shuttle she passed Torvott the pad and whispered the numeric password she placed on it to him, and quickly told him to read it, wipe it, and tell the others. "Good luck." she told him louder and with credits in hand moved to hail the cab.
It wasn't a long trip really, and the more she got closer the more she strengthened her resolve, the more her plan took place in her head. She nodded to the two troopers that greeted her and let them lead the way, she did rather love the temple, and it brought a sense of calming peace to her. Stepping into the throne room she paused, blinking at the new throne for a moment. That...hadn't been there before...
Oh...it..it was hers. Her gaze widened at the thought, he'd had it made for her, hoping that she'd take her place there. *Confident.* she thought with a faint smile turning to look back at him as he approached her.
She took him in and smiled, the helmet no longer scared her but...she sighed and took a step towards him "Will you remove it first?" she asked softly, she knew what it meant to him but...she always felt awkward talking to metal instead of...well...him, she'd told him before during the time she'd spent with him. "And it went as well as could be expected." she guessed that was one way to word it. "but…I want to talk to you, before we get to what I wanted to tell you." She moved to the windows over looking the city as she spoke, taking a moment before turning back to him "Will you tell me why?" she asked "Why genocide was a good idea? What it was supposed to do in the long run?" It bothered her so much, she had to know why he did it.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-26 12:32:47)

Darth Krayt had no problems in removing his helmet. His Sith markings on his face gave him a warlike look, but despite his age, he didn't look much past 30. He joined Daiyu overlooking the city.
**"Because it's war. People are going to die, it does not matter the fashion in which you choose to wage your battles. Innocent lives will be lost. The Alliance stole our advanced Star Destroyer and decimated one of our key naval production shipyards. And….Skywalker escaped. So I had to show them if they go to war with us that the punishment will be severe…..so the fear can be instilled. A military target would be expected and deemed an 'acceptable' loss by the Remnant. All military targets are expendable. It's been that way since the beginning of war. However, innocent lives lost are never acceptable. I have to show them my Empire will do whatever is required to restore peace. The statement has been made, and we've not had any major skirmishes from the Alliance for a few months. They know our commitment. My Empire must command respect through ultimate power and fear. The Alliance wishes to restore the Republic but history has always proven the Republic always fails….and more war continues to tear through our galaxy. Only tremendous power can keep the galaxy in order. The Dark Side must have it's place in the galaxy for balance to be achieved. I can do that. No matter the suffering I bring upon my soul for my sins. It is necessary. My humanity is lost, but it is to save others. Someone has to take the responsibility for the evil inherent in this universe, and I have chosen to do so."**
The last sentence let you know what Darth Krayt had really been burdened with. He felt himself some type of savior and or justified for his means. But as she pondered what he might be thinking he turned to her.
**"That is also why I need you. I understand the power of the Dark Side, and what it has done to me. I need a counterpart. Some….one that isn't so ingrained in this turmoil as I am."**

### **zerah** (2013-01-26 12:57:11)

Daiyu listened silently, taking it in. It made her so....sad...she understood the notion of needing loss in a war, she was in the imperial navy for ancestors sake, of course she understood that but he...he was putting this all on his own self, letting the dark side eat away at him for the better of others that would never see it. Never accept it.
She turned to him as he made mention of what she'd be again, his anchor, maybe even a chance to help him come back to humanity. Palpatine was a great leader, mistaken often and flawed as any but a great leader who's vision hadn't come to pass because of...because of mistakes. And here was Krayt, trying to do right in all senses, even if it meant others might never know.
He really was a good man. silver tongue or not, and she knew a lot about silver tongues thanks to Alvar, he sounded genuine...and that hurt. Idly she leaned more to him, until her side rested against his, letting her head rest on his shoulder for where it could reach with their difference in height.
"Do you regret the decision to kill them all? Do you think…maybe there could have been a different way? not genocide but…something else? enough to repopulate? there was too much death before is it truly necessary to have more…" she was mumbling now, not even really talking about the genocide but more on...them. Was it all worth it? was it worth it to lose herself? that was a selfish thought...was it worth it to lose him? either of them?
Was it....
wait...
What did he mean skywalker escaped? what skywalker? there was other skywalkers? was there...did she actually have family??? She looked up at him sharply, ready to ask but stopped herself. She couldn't let them know. Damn.
She frowned and closed her mouth, moving to the throne he had made for her and looked it over then turned to him, smiling faintly "So…you need an anchor." she said, less of a question and more of a statement, or tease by the smile, could go either way there.  "Would you listen to this anchor? say…if the anchor said that genocide was a silly idea? or…if the anchor wanted to go back up in a ship and continue to command a crew?" she didn't want to leave her crew, ancestors only knew what the sith would do to her poor crew...if she...she...ugh she couldn't even think it and not giggle or blush, damn emotions.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-26 13:18:30)

He looked at her with quite the stare.
**"I do not regret killing them. My life is pain, I know nothing else. I've seen the holovids from Darth Wyyrlok's orders. He released Viral spores into the oceans of Mon Calamari. Stormtroopers recorded bodies of Mon Calamari women and children washing ashore like any other lifeless sea creature. The deadly bacteria spread exponentially. Only an estimated 20 percent of 27 billion lifeforms residing in the oceans were presumed saved by the Alliance. There were other ways, of course. But this way will prove to be more effective. That planet has always been known to provide great support to the Republic and it's differing factions throughout time. This dealt significant damage to their Navy and Morale. They must realize their dealing with a truly relentless enemy."** 
**"If you wish to return to your normal duties you may do so. However, you may find my judgment lacking. That is fine. Many people wouldn't condone genocide and why should they? I'm not even human….. I'm a 'monster' or some hideous incarnation of the Force. True and everlasting peace can only be achieved through the Dark Side. It is only fear that people truly respect. The Jedi were noble and sacrificed their lives for the greater good, only to have it not work for them in the end. The Dark Side must always have a place in this galaxy. In my belief, that is the only true Balance of the Force."** 
The Emperor turned away from the viewports and back to his throne. Symbolically to take his seat, by himself, alone with his thoughts of evil and suffering. He believed in what he was doing, even if no one stood with him.

### **zerah** (2013-01-26 14:43:28)

Daiyu closed her eyes at the mention of the women and children dead. She didn't agree but...
She turned to look at him as he sat back in his seat. On one hand, she knew this could be his way of manipulating her, but...she'd be lying if she said she hadn't already made her choice a long time ago.
She moved to him, taking his hand gently to not startle him and sighed "you're not a monster. Ambitious, yes. Stubborn and willful, yes. but a monster?"  She reached her hand up to cup his cheek, taking his appearance in even the eyes and smiled "no…not a monster. but there is always, a better way." 
She flushes and withdraws her hands taking a step away, looking down. yes, she' d made her choice. Clearing her throat she drew a breath "I hope…you'll forgive me someday." She says softly, smiling sheepishly as she rested a finger to her lips with one hand and withdrew the open com with the other. Closing it sharply and handing it to him "always a better choice." She says softly, "maybe you'll ask me again…" She looks to the throne he made for her "someday." 
She sighs again, "Fel is here. Undercity, sewers leading here with a few imperial knights and Alvar and Invictus, neither are in their right mind. There was a plan to kill you, they' 're coming to do it. I have men from my ship that were brought against their will, they will hopefully be heading to the ship to wait orders…be kind to them, they didn't know." She looks down, "and I was put into this…but I won't do this." She couldn't bear to look at him and see...anger, disappointment, she didn't know.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-01-26 15:08:09)

Darth Krayt turned menacingly and he looked very concerned. His hand drifted close to his large lightsaber on his hip.
**"Roan Fel? And the two Sith I personally trained?! I need their exact location. They wanted you to kill me?! Such treachery….pity."**
The large armored figure walked with a slow and focused purpose to his throne. He pushed a button on the arm control console.
**"This is Lord Krayt speaking. Lord Nihl, put all sections of the Capital Sector on High Alert. 'Emperor' Roan Fel is allegedly in the Undercity somewhere with two Sith traitors. Deploy the troopers to cordon as many areas of the Capital Sector as possible. Track them down, but I will deal with the Emperor alone. Have all sectors of orbit scanned for any transports or vessels of any kind. No vessels are permitted to leave Coruscant or enter Coruscant. Alert our defense fleets to raise shields and arm weapons."**
*((You may make a knowledge technology check here Daiyu.))*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back in the Undercity sewers...Fel cursed at himself. He looked at Invictus and Malificere after overhearing the comms transmission.
**"My council was right. Has my ability with the Force diminished so much?! We have to get out of here…now."**

### **zerah** (2013-01-26 19:30:59)

Daiyu's heart leapt to her throat in a panic as she thought of her crew and Niles  "Krayt." she stopped herself from moving, the motion of her arm aborted abruptly as she looked down again, hands fastened in front of her.
She was a traitor to the knights, not like she really cared about them, but likely she would be viewed as a traitor to her beloved Empire as well. She likely wouldn't be given much, and she may only be granted one request. "Please…my…" she stopped herself again, it wasn't going to be hers anymore after this, start again.
"my Lord…the Vindicator and the Frontier are both in orbit, the Frontier's crew and commander have no knowledge of why they are here and the Vindicator's crew is equally in the dark, there is a shuttle to be headed up to it that contains a small command crew from it that are returning per my orders, please…" she gulped, trying to stop the shaking in her voice "please let them leave and get to safety. They had no say in any of this." neither did she but...it had to be her, if she chose to kill him it had to be her, or if like now it needed to be her...so she could save as many as she could.
"I don't have a right to ask. but I will beg if I have to, please don't hurt either of those ships." she didn't offer up the notions she had in her head, keep Fel hostage, come to agreements, the sith were blinded by darkness they couldn't control and an urge for power; she didn't have the right anymore. He wouldn't want her after this anyway.

While in the sewers, Maleficere was jerked from his thoughts by those that ran and looked to Invictus, then to Fel. "That does not bode well." He turned to Invictus and said sternly "Guard the Emperor...I have something I must attend to, I will not be going anywhere, I must consult the force on this matter." He looked to Fel with a sigh "If you wish, my lord, we may wish to just stay here while I do this...in case we are running in to a trap. We do not know if Krayt bought those that just turned tail..." He turned back to Invictus and instructed "If anyone comes down the sewers after us, unleash hell. Do whatever you have to do to keep the Emperor...and us safe." He then closed his eyes and meditated on the force, trying to see just what caused those escorts to run.
(Use the Force to try and see what the situation is, if they were betrayed etc. Using my 3rd to last DP, 2 remaining.)

### **wizard9660** (2013-02-15 01:58:03)

Invictus looked to his ally and nodded, looking into his eyes for a moment as if checking for something before nodding again. It was the kind of nod of a man resigned to die, as it seemed the most likely outcome at this point, and to think of all the times he should have died and was saved. "**Alright, but if I get blown up again i'm not sure how much more of me can be replaced with technology**" he says, letting out a joke, a trace of his old self. Perhaps even older than Alvar knew of him, since before he had joined the navy. **"You can rest assured though, I will tear the foundation out of this place before I allow you to be interrupted"** 
With that he turned toward the nearest sewer entrance and steeled himself, letting his rage flare up and then tempering it with iron willpower, slowly honing his emotions into a white hot blade of power, ready to direct as need be. It was almost a state of meditation, like resting on the eye of needle balancing in the eye of a storm. His driving force was coming from a single thought
***"Father, if you can hear me and you are my father, help me to do what you realized you should have done all those years ago"***
