Please post here for anything out of of character. If anyone reads this, I just want to let you know I enjoyed GMing for you guys yesterday. I thought you all had good ideas going in terms of character development. <!-- s:trooper: -->:<!-- s:trooper: -->

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-01-31 23:30:51)

Thanks so much for the positive feedback! As a GM you can never hear it enough! And what do you mean by Lord of the Flies? lol

### **zvi** (2012-02-01 05:33:43)

Yeah, it was indeed a good session. A little surprising, but a good session nonetheless.
I did miss the last half hour <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> but managed to read the logs afterwards <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-01 05:55:57)

Lord of The Flies...welll we have Max (I forgot the phrase you used to describe his weight, but I chuckled) or Piggy (i think he was in the book), the setting: desolate (akin to the island the boys are on)...just reminded me of it <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->, oh and me chanting for a fight, not quite his death...yet :p

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-01 14:25:35)

Thanks Zvi, for your positive feedback as well.
And I had no idea the session was so similar to the Lord of the Flies, as I have never read the book. But, I felt I did a good job on establishing the PC's as you guys seemed to care about them. I was a bit nervous having an "origin" story and not allowing you to have back stories, but I think this will really set the tone for the rest of the campaign as your characters will have been through a lot together.
I thought what really made the session good besides the NPC interaction is that I didn't have to run the session at a blistering pace to get to the "action". You guys took the ball and just ran with it. You all used your time wisely and did a good job at character development; which is saying a lot because most of you did not have back stories to work with when it came to talking about yourselves. I was really immersed in the session and I could almost feel myself sitting in the hut with the rest of the kids. I guess I am just weird like that lol.
But yea, definitely prefer virtual tabletop over PBP, it just feels more immersive because you don't have to pull yourself out of the mind set all the time. And I'm excited to play again this weekend to see how your characters handle the test given forth by Master Ristrin.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-04 19:38:50)

We already lost one PC...*sigh*. Not to mention we had several uses with comp issues and some no-shows....ugh...

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-05 03:12:29)

Other than that, I hope it was an enjoyable session. Master Ristrin now wishes to know who was most responsible for Anderson's death, it will be critical for the next session.

Well, the odds were firmly against Anderson...he had a lot of choices to make.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-06 04:56:34)

If in doubt, get captured and see if you Will and Fort are strong enough to survive torture until you're rescued?

---

### **zvi** (2012-02-06 09:03:34)

I will remember it next time.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-06 14:54:22)

Indeed, it was the easiest set of choices to make.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-08 02:41:20)

So looks like we got some players on the fence about this campaign. I will have to do some investigating and maybe shuffle the roster around a bit. So please bare with me.

Surprised you didn't take Skill Focus(Pilot) to help with your checks zvi.

---

### **zvi** (2012-02-10 10:47:34)

i guess thats because i am not yet too familier with the rules.
I will take up your suggestion and replace quickdraw with that skill focus <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-12 02:05:39)

Well we had a very long session yesterday (7 hrs I believe) and I really enjoyed it. My mind is in awe at all the events that happened; the trek up the mountains with Max, Horatios brutal death, and the success of the party at the end of the session despite setbacks.
I hope you all had as much fun playing in it as I did running it, and I'm eager to move your characters ahead into full adulthood for the next phase of their training.
We lost another good character with Horatio. I really hope you roll up a new character bud...you are a great RPer and your character was brave.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-12 04:11:42)

They managed to work together without Zeisan and braved the molten areas of the cave to complete the trial. They made sure not to awake sleeping beast while hunting for food. The group achieved success and shared a grandoise feast with the yinchorri for going to adulthood.

Tried to stay in character 'til the very end :P Am still playing it over in my head though...can DPs stop CdGs?
They can make attacks against you miss. But, I'm sure most likely the PC's would of kept beating on you until you were dead anyways.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-17 14:58:36)

Welcome back Jaybee! We need to determine a Noble Sacrifice benefit for you to impart on party members of your choosing who witnessed your tortuous death.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-19 04:01:05)

Well we had a lot happen this session. We played around eight hours. The group had travesed through the perils to find a golden statue of Darth Vader that held his lightsaber.
Zeisan went to retrieve it but the statue firmly grabbed him as the floor collapses beneath him. And zeisan was suspended over a bed of spikes below. Janelle climbed the Vader statue to save him but it was too late. The wrist of Vader released and Zeisan fell into the pit and dying a painful death in the spike bed. Then, janelle almost fell which it took almost all of Daiyus strength to pull Janelle up. They just barely saved Janelles life.
At the end of dungeon there a similar statue, this time of Emperor Palpatine. He held a lightsaber and Alvar recovered the actual lightsaber of palpatine. He was henceforth proclaimed the heir to the Emperor

I am using 1.7.1 and it works fine.

Yeah I might try 1.7, was using 1.8. Works fine on my desktop...just think my Laptop doesn't like it (maybe too powerful lol).
If I get it working during the week/tonight, could I be cheeky and ask for a midweek catchup/side session? Time dependent...etc?

Did you try this? <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=25186](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=25186 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=25186")<!-- l -->
You can backup your tree most likely and import it once everything works again. Should be able to do that regardless of which version you're using.

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-20 12:32:30)

Yep, it seems after running it more than x times, it refuses to boot up again and forces me to do a full install over again (python files and all)

Weird.. maybe try going into the Traipse / sysyem / myfiles folder and try deleting the metaserver file.
Might take a little longer to load as it repopulatesbut it may be the metaserver file is becoming corrupted.
If that all fails. I highly recommend you going to the Mayhem Gaming forum and seeing if there's any troubleshooting info there. The Traipse devs do most of their support there.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-21 03:34:03)

so how did the training go after i left?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-26 03:07:09)

Blue squad won their close quarters and drop ship training exercise. Unfortunately combat didn't go as smoothly as I wanted. I am quite disappointed in myself. Alvar managed to ko daiyu in the H2H training and zeisan was knocked out too.

One more event and then its off to the naval academy. Also I will open a sidequest for this week it will be first come first serve.

## Side Quest Board

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-27 14:38:57)

In this thread, there will be side quests available at random dates and times. They are on a first come first serve basis and limited to the first person's time slot. The side quests will typically have something to do with current events in some form or fashion, but is a way to gain rare items, fame, or experience. Side quests are typically have a slot limit as to expedite the process in getting the game in motion and over within a timely manner. These sessions typically range very short in length from 30 mins to 2 hrs.

## Re: Side Quest Board

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-02-27 15:14:31)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**SIDE QUEST 1: STORMTROOPER HAND TO HAND TRAINING (SHOCK BOXING)**</span>
**Slots Available:**
Slot 1:
Slot 2:
***Quest Descriptor***
The Empire has its own Shock Boxing league present within its ranks and most notably allocated to Imperial Navy tradition. During your training on Bastion, Commander Andwalker approaches the squad barracks and asks if anyone would like to compete in an official Imperial sanctioned Shock Boxing match. The experience looks good on your dossier as well as teaches you good fighting skills for future Imperial endeavors. He needs two combatants to participate in the Shock Boxing ring in the Recruit Deport Headquarters....
**SHOCK BOXING RULES**
**FORCE POINTS**:
In Shock Boxing FP usage is free if you use a successful skill check (free action) against your opponent. The amount of FP you get to spend is not based on your level. For example an eighth level character gets 2d6 FP but not so in this case. Your free FP to spend are determined on three factors; STR mod, Dex mod, and Martial arts level. To illustrate let's look here: Andwalker has a STR score of 12 (Modifier of 1), a DEX score of 14 (Modifier of 2), and Martial arts 2. Now we can determine his free FP to hit using this formula (STR MOD 1 + DEX MOD 2+ MARTIAL ARTS 2)= 5. So Andwalker can spend 5d6 FP to hit or add to his damage with a successful hit after using a skill check that affected his opponent. These free Force points are used to deal massive damage to your opponent which can stun, knockdown, or knock out your opponent. So your STR MOD, DEX MOD, and MARTIAL ARTS level determines how many die you get to spend with your free FP. However, there is only so hard you can hit, once you reach 6d6 your free FP level caps. You can still spend your normal FP which cost their regular amount, and these can still earn you a knockdown, stun, or knockout.
<strong>Skills that can be used against opponents to earn these FREE FP:</strong>
Endurance, Deception, Persuasion, Acrobatics, Jump are permitted though failing these skills makes them a -2 to your defense. Failing this skill check also provokes an AoO in which your opponent can use their Free FP to possibly stun, knockdown, or knock you out. So setting a FREE FP usage is essentially making a gamble to hit your opponent with a powerful shot. Generally, most skills that have a physical application in combat can be used to set up a FREE FP usage at the GM's discretion.
<em><strong>HOW TO HIT YOUR OPPONENT</strong></em> Considering in a shock boxing match that you are normally very close to your opponent, your to hit is not to equal or exceed the target's reflex defense. Rather, you must be able to hit by equalling or exceeding their DEX or CON score, whichever is higher.
This represents the fact that you are always in front of your opponent and that hitting them is simply a matter of punching through their guard or timing a blow to their head. The degree in which you beat your opponent's Fortitude Defense with FREE FP DMG determines the following conditions you inflict on your opponent (Remember you can only spend this FREE FP by risking a skill check use to set up your power shot):
**STUN**: A player hit with FP DMG who suffers dmg by 1 degree of success becomes stunned. This player loses his next turn and can only fight defensively or atk with a -2, and goes negative -1 or -2 on the con track. Players hit while “STUNNED” become knocked down or knocked out by 1 or 2 degrees of success.
**KNOCKED DOWN**: A player hit with FP DMG who suffers dmg by two degrees of success is knocked down. A player that is knocked down must succeed on a cumulative ENDURANCE CHECK of DC 15 to get back up. If they fail the endurance check, they do not get back up. Players can only spend normal FP on this check to get back up.
**KNOCKED OUT**: A player who is knocked out must beat a ENDURANCE check of 40 to get back up, otherwise, they are defeated and out cold. If they awake, they are -4 on the con track. This is caused by a hit of 3 or more degrees of success from FP dmg. However, someone hit with a critical hit is also knocked out. But the dc endurance check of such a knockout is equal to their to hit roll. For example, Andwalker rolls a natural 20+8. The opponent must roll an endurance check of 28 or higher to resist the knockout and keep fighting.
**TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT**: If the opponent is deemed unable to defend himself or is suffering serious injuries, the referee will end the match and declare the aggressive fighter the victor.
***SHOCKBOXING GLOVES***: +2 to unarmed DMG, Stun Mode…cannot kill. Can be switched to light shock for +1 dmg.
*ROUNDS* A 3 minute round of shock boxing is 10 turns. Once both combatants have taken 10 turns they can go back to their corner and make an endurance check to recover HP equal to one half their heroic level (or non heroic level in some cases). Amateur league fights usually last 30 turns in which a victor is determined by decision.
All other combat rules remain the same... <strong>But to sum Shock boxing up in a nutshell: Just add together your STR MOD, DEX MOD, and your martial arts level. That is the amount of FREE FP you get to spend if you use a successful skill check against your opponent to deal a power shot. (It caps at 6d6). To hit your opponent you need only beat their con or dex score whichever is lower. </strong> All of the rest of the details I can handle.

Had a short good fun session (about an hour or so), of course i had my regular natural 1 rolls <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> but it was a fight won by a KO after the second round)
The other boxer placed a good one on Blake (17 Damage), Blake decieved being hurt too badly (A natural 20 on decieve roll) which took the other boxer off guard and Blake placed a very good one on him for (30 Damage) the boxer fell to the ground. Win by a knockout!
Another win for the Blue team (i guess) and this time against another company.

It looks like the party has arrived to graduation of the Stormtrooper corps. Next weeks session will be crucial as it will be the Naval academy and the foundation to your careers. Missing this section could cost you dearly.
Also this weeks sidequest will be up soon.

## Re: Side Quest Board

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-03-06 03:21:04)

Much to my surprise the side quest sold like hot cakes. Daiyu and Alvar competed in their first ever GSBF match. The rules zvi helped me tweak seem to have fine tuned the combat immensely.
It was 3 hard fought rounds that nearly went to a decision.
In the first round Alvar was primarily the aggressor and scored a knockdown against Daiyu, which caused her to fight defensively for the second round.
In the third round Daiyu was much more aggressive extending her punches in powerful fashion and Alvar just barely dodged these attacks. Alvar responded with a one two punch and the dmg was too much for Daiyu as she was KO'ed in the third round.
I had an amazing time running this fight and it really makes me want to do more boxing quests. We even had a lurker say he wanted to join based on how smooth the combat was. I kind of want to see zvi vs alvar now..-dk know about you guys.

Captain Teness Kraia - Execuitve Officer, admin

### **zerah** (2012-03-18 17:28:11)

master died at graduation with us, he gave Alvar some pyramid thing and then was going to tell Daiyu something and then he passed, the body vanishing and just leaving the armor and helmet and robe. Daiyu found a lightsaber in his pocket that she kept, Alvar found a datapad saying that, that project thing was on track and then the latest entry at the graduation was "I love you children." Ball was okay but it was after the death, not much happened we kinda skipped through it really, don't know our ship yet but we had to leave early.
There was a dream sequence of Qui-gon Jin and Awne and Kaz'jee but we don't know who the dream was from. and then we ended.

Well, not yet an admiral from as far as i got with them, just a LT.
Yeah, might be the GMT thing that causes me to miss out on all the goodies, but i guess only DW can really answer that.

Once again, another long session under our belts. I am curious, but does everyone feel the space battle was well ran? I certainly enjoyed it.. Especially the amazing turbolaser barrage from the Venerator and Ajudicator that tore into the Star Forge's command sphere. That was all due to Commander Niles excellent firing trajectories.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-25 04:37:44)

Lol yeah, was gonna say you might of enjoyed it, doubt you wuold haev survived in a TIE fighter though, the Star Forge was massive and had LOTS of guns. The Ajudicator was getting ripped apart. Our Medical and Repair decks have pretty much been wiped out. 200 or so dead. The Venerators hanger bays were hit before it turnd its guns on us. They took 100 in casualties.

---

### **zvi** (2012-03-25 04:48:54)

I would have been 1 of about 50 TIE's in space so i might have surrvived and ships that BIG have a hard time hitting a small size starfighter, but yes 1 hit from a very strong weapon might just get the starfighter blown to pieces.
Did you blew up the space station or just crippled it and we can board it later? (or you have already done so?)

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-25 04:56:45)

Crippled it's weapons. It then powered down it's shields.
Me, Alvar and the protocol droid then boarded.
We were met by one of the Verpine on board and then there was a lot of information and chatting that i missed out on (fell asleep). Basically there's an imperial crew already on board the station, which we found out is a Star Forge. Currently reading the logs to see what else happened lol

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-25 04:58:49)

Oh before the station attacked we were being sucked into an anomoly too. BUt overcame it by reversing the polarity on our ion cannons and rerouting power from other systems to fire at the anomoly

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-25 05:20:49)

Catch up part 2: Alvar's holocron opened a door in the station that the guys on board had never accessed before. It was a massive clone growing facility. All the clones were naked females. His holocron then opened up and revealed a message from a Jedi (the person who the clones are based on). She was being consumed by a Dark Side curse. She was on Endor or at least somewhere that had Ewoks.
The Imperial captain on board the Star Forge revealed his research of the species that created it and how they were taught the force by ethereal beings.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-25 05:37:11)

Catch up 3: The guys were tinkering with some controls and a starshp appeared outside (I'm guessing created by the Star Forge....but that's not common knowledge I don't think. that's just game knowledge lol :P)
One of the clones broke out of the tanks and spoke to Dai. Mentioned a string of names in cluding Awne (who i don't know, but the others seem to). Before mentioning that the force was strong here.
Alvar spoke to the Moff. Relayed what we'd found and now everyone is n board the Star Forge. We now have orders to head to Endor and to leave our R&D complement on board the Star Forge.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-03-25 17:21:06)

That's true, that was remarkable firing data for the gunners to utilize. The fire was pinpointed that it ripped right through the Star Forge's shields. It had reduced the Adjudicator to 1300 HP and -1 on the con track.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-03-25 18:23:16)

Well the way I do it for homebrew in ship combat, generally going down on the con track means a system was destroyed...hence the med bay and vehicle maintenance bays being destroyed.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-03-25 18:42:59)

I actually look forward to the next space battle. I thought it was handled well. And yea, if it had hit you again...most likely it would have destroyed 3 to 4 more systems...possibly significant damage to the bridge since you were likely facing forward to the Star Forge (And not broadside).

After the *Legion* fleet made the discovery of the wondrous and ominous Star Forge; they have now received new orders from the collective minds of Moff Treven and Moff Tayus. Their orders are to travel to Endor, and see if they can discover the artifact depicted in one of the holovids, as it may be some link or clue to the powers of the Star Forge itself.
Admiral Alvar and Captain Klaus were ordered to leave their Research and Development team to aid the other researchers in uncovering the mysteries of the Star Forge. This may come as unnerving to the commanders of each ship. Nevertheless, Admiral Alvar sends a shuttle out with a droid pilot to test the defensive screen of the Star Forge. It seemed safe enough, so both ships launched into hyperspace from a stationary position just in front of the Star Forge.
Their destination was to the Bunduki system. In the Bunduki system, there is a Imperial space dock available for use. Before the orders are to be carried out on Endor, they must dock in the Bunduki system for repairs and await replacement for their fallen crew members.
((Obviously, this will be a chance for gear head PC's to make any adjustments to the ship as they see fit. And this will allow leadership to counsel their crew and go over any mission data they've obtained. It will also offer tremendous RP free time)).

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-03-29 02:23:38)

Well, today's side quest was good. It was basic in nature and allowed the crew to refit and upgrade the Adjudicator. It had its shields increase by ten and added another turbolaser battery.
Captain Daiyu accessed Master Ristrin's holocron and received basic instruction on lightsaber Form III; Soresu. She trained with a remote droid ala A New Hope and managed to get a good enough roll to deflect all its shots.
Admiral Alvar laid out the groundwork for the upcoming mission to Endor, which has received a Top Secret classification. And a cloak and dagger suggestion not to mention the Star Forge to anyone, especially the Sith.
Then a scout fighter emerged from hyperspace and Blake scrambled his TIE to make contact. The strange starfighter engaged the TIE but was no match for Blakes precise shooting who crippled his systems quickly. The enemy managed to skim the TIE with a proton but was destroyed by Blakes own torpedo..It was a good dog fight..
I feel the campaign is going so well and I hope you all do too. That being said, I won't be able to host this saturday. Even though I'm going on a weekend retreat I am definitely going to have withdrawals from this game...

---

### **zvi** (2012-03-29 04:06:40)

Sorry, i do not have the logs for the fight, i think i logged off of orpg.
but i more or less remember what happened.
We tried to hail the unundentified starfighter but to no awail. Blake was scrambled to get a closer look at the starfighter or try to understand why its not answering our calls.
I approcahed it to a very close quarters and tried to hail it several times, then it got its weapons locked on me.
I won the init and fired first a salvo of laser fire which hit him for about 86 points of damage (and since i have devestating attack heavy weapons, crippled it a little), it fired back hitting me for about a 60. I shot again and hit for another 60+ damage, it tried to fire a torpedo on me but i made an opposed piloting check and avoided it (one of my talents <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> ).
Blake decided it was too risky to continue pepping it up with laser fire and released a torpedo at it, (rolled a natural 20) the damage from that torpedo was 112 and if you multi it again by 2, it did 224 of total damage, needless to say the starfighter was blown to very small pieces (there goes a command from Daiyu and the admiral to try and keep it alive, lol)
A few thoughts on the dog fight:
1. starfighters are fregile and can explode with one good shot.
2. I need to go over the rules and talents of space fighting to understand them more and how to use them, so next time the fight will be run more smoothly.
Oh, and Niles expect your ass to get kicked next time, they found out you lied to the Commander about the "repairs" the admiral asked. especially the larger bar thing, rotfl.

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-29 04:17:59)

Nice....over very quickly then! These starfighters don't last long. But nice crit!

Ahh yeah, I thought they might find out about it :P I have my reasons and can fully back them up <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **zvi** (2012-03-29 04:37:33)

I do not think you can mount an escape pod in a starfighter and even if you could you would not have time to get it to jettison before the ship explodes.
On the other hand you have your flight suit which should let you survive even if your ship goes to 0 hp, but you do take certain damage if the ships goes. I think the damage was just too massive after it was already crippeld by the other shots.
Blake did do a few cirlces looking to see if the pilot survived but could not find any indication he did or body for that matter.
In short, yes if i would have taken that amout of damage the TIE would have been blown to pieces, and probably would have killed Blake instantly.
What i am thinking is maybe to modify the TIE shields (SR) and armour to the max.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-03-29 07:47:20)

Wouldn't upgrading the armour sacrifice how nimble TIEs are?
If a starship explodes I'm pretty sure the death rate is 100% (or very very close to it)

---

### **zvi** (2012-03-29 08:26:29)

well, don't think so, upgrades are working with emplacement points so as long i am only upgrading the armour but staying with the same emplacement points it is only a cost and time thing. I will be checking it up.
I am pretty sure that you can survive a ship destruction, depending on what the last hit damage was, i think i read that if the ship explodes you take half damage from the last shot.
You need to be wearing a flight suit to survive in space and even then only for a very short time, like several hours.
I will be reading on it more to get all the answers right.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-03-30 00:19:03)

An escape pod or ejection seat is canon I believe in Star Wars. If you remember Biggs Darklighter advises Porkins to eject from his X Wing after taking damage. He says, "Eject!" And Porkins refuses and is subsequently destroyed.
Whether or not a TIE fighter has ejection capabilities is unlikely. But its interesting to note that pilots' chest apparatuses had a button to push in case they ejected or were stranded. It would send out a distress call to any friendly ships as they were adrift.
But I will definitely research TIE ejection equipment. Again its unlikely cause I doubt the Empire would spend that much money as TIEs were viewed as expendable and cheap to mass produce.

## Side Quest Results

Well the sidequest ended and the initial stages of planning has begun. The Admiral and Daiyu have left guidelines for the rest of the crew to complete the planning for the mission on Endor.
Some details:
Orbital bombardment can only be authorized by Commodore Janelle and one other senior officer. (Not commander Niles).
Only a small away team of the PCs will be deployed with a few non uniformed troops with weapons holstered.
Blake will provide air support for recon on the Endor settlements.
Commander Niles will be advisory role for this mission and is not permitted to leave the ship and is to be watched by HK and two troopers.
Rules of engagement are only to fire when fire upon.
The mission will be generally diplomatic in nature; and the away team is to apologize for the Empire's action in the past.
The rest of the crew is to take these guidelines and complete the planning how they see fit.

Out of interest and for my own sanity: Is there any way to fuck those two over when they miss the sessions or are they immune to it all? Because hell I know when I miss a session I miss out on goodies (which dont materialise when I play) or get knocked down a peg, hell if I miss any more I'll be on latrine duty.

## Re: Side Quest Results

### **zerah** (2012-04-05 21:26:58)

you made your bed when you informed someone that you had orders from the Admiral and tried to put a new larger bar in the ship, that's using resources that could be put to better uses. Niles was found out, impersonating a superior officer and lying like that is grounds for court marshal. You knew that was a likely outcome didn't you? why get upset about it? As for fucking us over? we miss plenty when we can't make a game, we've done nothing but play the characters after all and the ranks are above Niles. I hate missing sessions, it sucks, I feel like when I get back I missed a whole lot.
Anyway, yea. there was a point there somewhere...oh right, I guess just keep in mind of consequences?

---

## Re: Side Quest Results

### **Maldoravia** (2012-04-05 22:32:41)

Seriously Niles...The way you put that was not cool at all. It shouldn't be -anyone's- prerogative oocly to 'fuck' anyone over. I would have understood if you had asked simply "Just out of curiosity...will there be penalties incurred for them for missing two sessions?" But asking "Is there a way to fuck those two over" is just....well...ass-hattery. Your character made his bed when he decided to lie to the Admiral, and also lie -about- him saying he had okay-ed a decision. In all honesty.....you 'fucked' yourself over with that one. The point is to keep in mind...its just a game =) I mean yeah I'd be bummed if Alvar got knocked off....but I certainly wouldn't throw a childish fit if something didn't turn out the way I wanted. Oh and for the record? Alvar will most likely be trying to get Niles dishonorably discharged for his crimes, at the least kicked off his ship.

---

## Side Quest Results

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-06 03:42:52)

Maybe I put it wrong then, but you got the point.
However Niles only make up these little things for himself because there is little interaction from other characters. If it wasn't for him being a drunk or whatever else I concocted he would have had very little other opportunity to RP with another character outside of the main story arc.

---

## Side Quest Results

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-06 04:11:35)

The logic behind it: previous games (notably the one at the academy) dictated that Daiyu or Janelle wouldn't Interact with Niles (Janelle because she found it difficult to involve new players and Daiyu because she didn't know him well enough or anyway was just equally cold to him). Leaving just Alvar and Blake.
So that's who he interacts with given his opportunity since he doesn't have a dedicated subplot like Moffs, Sith, lightsabers and holocrons to pursue.
*Shrugs* well Niles'll await what's decided for him.

---

## Re: Side Quest Results

### **zvi** (2012-04-06 08:39:35)

Well....
I guess you should look at it in our eyes (meaning Jaybee and me).
If you just look up at decision on top of this page, you will see that you set yourself with RP opportunity but left, Blake flying above, Niles too, with little or nothing to do, on the RP side. I have no clue what will happen on the planet and if i get to do anything or just fly above the whole session.
I mean, yes, you are the ranking officers etc but you tie us up, even if you do it unintentionaly thats what comes out of it <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

## Re: Side Quest Results

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-06 12:26:46)

They only want you to fly at the beginning of the mission Zvi. The rest of the mission you will be on foot with the away team. However, even if you stayed in the TIE the whole time you could still use your subspace radio to talk to the ground team; so its not like you'd have 0 RP opportunity even in the case you were flying air support the whole time.
