<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**137.3 ABY**</span>
Perhaps to the dismay of Commodore Daiyu and Darth Malificere, the Lambda shuttle entered hyperspace. It wasn't long before the crew reported that they were able to track the vehicle because of its transponder code being similar to that of the *Vindicator.* It was headed towards Wild Space. The heading seemed to be closest to the Manaan system. This would complicate matters. Where exactly was she headed? Could they be for sure despite everything Awne told them? Would Lord Krayt follow after Awne?
Nevertheless, they had a meeting with Darth Krayt in the *Chamber of Offering* to follow up on pressing matters. Once back in the repulsive Coruscant Undercity, they walked into the putrid Vong shaping chambers to witness Fel's pathetic and helpless position. His legs were now being replaced by pale, humanoid Vong implants. The implants were similar to Yuuzhan Vong flesh, tough on the outside yet disfigured and mangled. His new legs showed all the inner workings and grotesque guts of the leg. You could see bone, muscle, and sinew move as he struggled about the shaping table. There were Vonduun Crabshell armor pieces laid out. You learned they would be soon grafted painstakingly to the exposed leg muscles of Roan Fel. Malificere and Daiyu could tell he was suffering immensely. Malificere was likely comparing his torture to that of Fel's. He had not lost limbs. Fel's affinity to the Force was also diminishing as human flesh was being replaced by Vong organisms. All living creations by the Vong were innately void in the Force. Krayt would reveal that most of his human tissue and body parts would be replaced by that of Vong design.
This would effectively render Roan Fel a shell of his former human self, and sever an estimated 90 percent of his connection to the Force. Krayt had offered the only ultimatum for Fel was to give away Skywalker's location. Then if he did so, Darth Krayt would grant him a merciful death so that he could become one with the Force and have some hope of communicating with his daughter. This interrogation would continue for another two days. Darth Krayt burned out each of Fel's eyeballs with his lightsaber and they were replaced with a Vong shaped variant. The eyes were completely black as a Sith lightsaber crystal, and just as ominous. After his human vision was lost, Fel had enough.
Roan Fel revealed he had sparse communication with Cade Skywalker and he was known to be moving about the Deep Core Region along with a good sized element of the Galactic Alliance Remnant. Possibly 60 percent of their forces. Darth Krayt was pleased with this information. You had received a battle damage assessment that 52,212 people had died in the Ravelin City bombing. The wounded number was still growing. Also, it was confirmed that an estimated 80-100 Imperial Knights were killed in the attack as well. If those numbers were correct, there were only about a dozen or so Imperial Knights left. Marisah Fel's location couldn't be confirmed yet. So there was a good probability she was dead. Needless to say, this was most likely a turning point for the Imperial Knight's to lose the war. Their fleet still were strong, but they no longer had the Imperial Knights to lead them with the Force. This would give Krayt's Empire a tremendous edge, and they would be in disarray at the destruction of Fel's headquarters. All this was in accordance to Darth Malificere's contributions. Bastion was nigh impregnable. But without their planetary shield, they were just an open target to a barrage of turbolasers from Darth Miladi's fleet.
The biggest threat to Krayt's Empire was now Skywalker, the Alliance Remnant, and a handful of Jedi. Now it was more like the First Imperial Civil War, the Rebellion vs the Empire. Only the Remnant would likely be reinforced by Fel's Empire, which was still significant. Krayt's military strength was now much more significant with the Genocide of Dac and the Ravelin bombardment. Now the Force was heavily tilted toward the favor of the Sith Empire. Any Force praciticioner would know that this would drastically benefit the Sith Empire as they would draw from the Dark Side for better leadership. Someone empowered with the Force simply just made a better leader out of wisdom alone. Overall, the Sith Empire now had better leadership.
Darth Krayt would later go on to release information to those Imperial Knights left of the destruction he had caused, they would all be destroyed. He would go on to show HoloNet footage of the disfigured Roan Fel. Then, he would display his execution at the hands of Darth Wyyrlok by brutal blasts of lightning. Roan Fel died in front of their very eyes. Krayt had now made three powerful statements in terms of military strategy.
Now, it was time to find Skywalker.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**137.4 ABY**</span>
Due to Darth Malificere's superior performance, he was given the honor of spearheading the operation to find Skywalker. The Legate Fleet; in which Malificere commanded, would be deployed to the Deep Core systems just nearby the Core Systems. The Legate Fleet would be patrolling in the Deep Core system alone and in a reconnaissance formation. That meant the *Vindicator* and the *Frontier* would keep roughly four systems distance dispersion at all times while patrolling. This meant if they were discovered they might face superior forces, but they were less likely to be spotted in a singular unit. They could also stop their Capital vessels near danger areas and send the snub fighters forward to recon said areas. It was a dangerous operation, but extremely important and the Legate Fleet was now the sword of Krayt himself...they would be potentially delivering the fatal blow to the Alliance themselves. However, oddly enough, Commodore Daiyu was ordered to remain on Coruscant. Darth Krayt had something special planned for the Commodore. So, Malificere and Thorpe took their vessels into hostile space while she remained safe.
The *Frontier* deployed to Quadrant 11 of the Deep Core; in extreme range of the Odik system to which they would likely be patrolling for quite sometime. The *Vindicator* would deploy to Quadrant 12-Kilo of the Deep Core, on approach vector to the Liliac system. Both vessels of the Legate Fleet initially arrived into no danger and no anomalies to report. They would begin a slow approach to each of their systems of responsibility. The two Commanders would communicate only in burst transmission via subspace radio. The Commanders might loathe the long arduous nature of this recon mission, but they likely both understood it's importance and implications. Fortunately for the Commanders, reinforcements were in the the adjacent system to the Deep Core. That was the Core System. It was a curious place for the Alliance to be, as this was the closest region to Coruscant. They had likely infiltrated the Core Worlds in low numbers and with extreme stealth. Or was this a ploy by Roan Fel? He had seemed to be telling the truth. Nevertheless, the two Commanders remained focused and pushed their fleet onward.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Coruscant**</span>
Meanwhile, on Coruscant, Commodore Daiyu would receive a surprise as to why she wasn't to attend to the Deep Core patrol. There was to be a grand change of command ceremony. The Legate Fleet was understaffed by one capital vessel. Formally, it had the  *Adjudicator* as its flagship. So it was down one vessel. Darth Krayt would present Commodore Daiyu with a ship of her own to command. In parade fashion, an *Imperious* class Star Destroyer was at space dock above Coruscant. She would be assuming command from Captain Joriff Elma. The ship was called the  *Malevolence.*

</details>

The ceremony was of high Imperial decorum at the space dock. There were several TIE fighters in parade formation orbiting space dock as Commodore Daiyu was personally escorted to the bridge of the *Malevolence* by Darth Krayt. On the bridge, she would formally assume command Captain Elma with a salute.
Afterwards, there was a rare occasion that happened on the sleek and advanced bridge. There was a round of applause. This almost never happened in the stoic line of duty that the Imperials presented. But she had received it, and had received her own ship of 7,700 personnel to command. Darth Krayt had smiled too, which was equally as rare. He would conclude the ceremony with sealed flimsiplast orders to report to Quadrant 11-Meta of the Deep Core to patrol for Skywalker and to report under command of Malificere in the Legate Fleet. However, she answered directly to Lord Krayt, even before Malificere. This was odd, and could cause conflicts. But for whatever reason, Krayt had ordered this fleet to be conducted as such.
After one week, Commodore Daiyu found herself in the command chair of one of the premier vessels of the Sith Empire. Captain Elma approached her, he was an old man, likely in his late 50s and close to retirement. He reported in for the morning with a salute.
**"Ma'am, I report no anomalies on our approach to the Thoadeye system of Quadrant 11-Meta. We've sent an initial report to Darth Malificere by subspace radio that we've arrived to reinforce their efforts. Our rules of engagements have also changed to only fire when fired upon, we are to maintain a high level of stealth and tactical awareness on our approach to avoid detection by the Alliance or Imperial forces. In the event of enemy contact, we are to withdraw unless we are assured total destruction of the enemy element so they cannot report to higher authority. If we withdraw, we are to immediately notify Darth Krayt via HoloNet. Again, welcome aboard the  *Malevolence.***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Vindicator**</span>
As Darth Malificere received his morning report from Captain Torvott, he couldn't believe his ears. Commander Niles had checked in, but he also learned that Daiyu was now commanding an *Imperious* class vessel, which was superior to his own. What was Darth Krayt thinking? Yes, it was true Commodore Daiyu was still under command of Malificere, but she was for all intents and purposes commanding the flagship. Was this another way to get at Darth Malificere orchestrated by Krayt to get to him, or was it simply his way of favoring Daiyu. Or, perhaps even worse, maybe Krayt felt she was a superior naval officer than Malificere? Either way, he might not like this. Was it best to focus on this mission? Or the Dark Side for answers? At any rate, the search for Skywalker and the Jedi was well underway.
Perhaps in both Daiyu and Malificere's head, they wondered what Awne was up to. Her last known location had showed up in Wild Space near a tremendous energy anomaly which was identical to the Star Forge's.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

*You can retcon Awne's escape and stop her, but for expediency's sake I'll assumed she escaped pending any objections. Also, for some reason which is oddly unexplained…Darth Krayt seemed to have no knowledge of Awne's escape. You may ask him about this if you wish. Also, all commanders must make three knowledge tactics checks and description as to how your going to conduct reconnaissance of your respective areas of space. Again, Malificere is on approach to the Liliac system and Daiyu the Thoadeye system. Daiyu you can also tell me if you submitted the sector report yet or not, and will receive credit for it if you did.*

Maleficere was now beside himself with a mixture of rage and feelings of something he had no clue what it was. there was no word for it. Krayt had known that he had wanted a new ship, and instead gave it to someone else. Where the hell was HIs reward for all he had done? His patience...had finally snapped. though he appeared calm on the outside...He was now making even more complex calculations inside his head than before, and would either try to use this new-found rage to prove himself once and for all....or change the Universe itself. For now, he simply paced inside the cargo hold...concentrating on the mission at hand. If Krayt would not give him some sort of beneficial reward...then he would simply take it by force in the future. A thought occurred to him...Awne. He was no match for Krayt yet alone...but perhaps she was. He gave off a smirk before moving from the Cargo hold to the bridge. As for being without Daiyu...After two years she had still remained his, he had no doubt that this brief time apart would be less straining...He knew that she would still be his.

The sight of Fel had been hard, to see someone that had once been proud and strong reduced to...that...had made her sick, and reminded her again of what had happened on Bastion. She didn't stay for the interrogation, excusing herself on the grounds of dealing with Moffs before retreating quickly back to the temple and the secure holo where she finally made her suggestions to the new Moff, as well as the strong...suggestion...that aid be given to the civilians of Bastion as a sign of good faith on the premise that by helping those they've hurt that didn't deserve it they would grow in favor in the eyes of the innocents. Which would help to regain imperials.
When Alvar launched back into space for the new mission to find Cade, Daiyu was beside herself. Torn between disbelief that she had been left behind and anger that Krayt may think she wasn't suited for command. Imagine then her surprise when she found herself in her best Imperial dress and being escorted by said Sith to...her own ship. The applause, the smile from Krayt, if she didn't have such control over her emotions she would have cried from joy. She had her own ship, a better ship, and a crew that seemed to already respect her. She had thanked Krayt softly, not for any possible favoritism, no, she had damn well earned this. And she thanked him for seeing that.
Better still, she was taking part in finding Cade. Deeply she hoped she would be the one to find him first.
Seated in her command chair she looked over to Elma with a faint smile before he began speaking. He was a good man, and it was nice to have someone with more years as her Captain though she was certain he must be ready to retire...not like her, she'd only go kicking and screaming.
She nodded her head in understanding and hummed faintly, how to go about this. They could do probes...or they could send fighters down. Probes might be more stealthy in the long run...also less likely to be toyed with by Jedi. And if the signal went dark they'd know where to look, however...if they do fighters then she would have people that could blend in and ask questions.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">137.5 ABY</span>
About one week had passed, so Malificere's fleet had been out here for a month total. Commodore Daiyu's ship had only been out here a week. Malificere had pondered who was strong enough to defeat Darth Krayt, and Awne seemed just as strong...if not stronger. She *could* make a powerful ally. The farghul was also completely isolated in Wild Space; most likely onboard the Star Forge. However, he knew she was a Jedi. It would take all his skills in the art of Dun Moch to get her to commit. Or would she simply destroy Darth Krayt out of loyalty to the Jedi way? At any rate, intelligence reports had reported negative from the Lialic system. No trace of the Alliance could be detected there. So the *Vindicator* was on its way to the Zamael System.
Meanwhile, Commodore Daiyu had finished up her patrol of the Thoadeye system. She had deployed fighters to the surface and reported the planet was relatively advanced. Foodstuffs seemed to be the major export and could serve as a temporary base of operations if she needed it to be. The population seemed relatively Sith-Empire friendly which was good, they likely wouldn't offer save haven to the Alliance. Thankfully, the TIE fighter patrols seemed to be working very efficiently. The TIE predators were smaller, faster, and more maneuverable. She knew these models were more suited for reconnaissance than the bulkier models Darth Malificere had at his disposal. She kept the TIE squadron moving in front of the *Malevolence* as a forward scout unit. Her ship was now ordered to the Ebaq system, which was close to the Thoadeye system. Commodore Daiyu was shown by the Captain on a transparisteel map panel that her unit was covering more ground than the *Frontier* and the *Vindicator*. She knew her recon elements were being just as efficient and quick. All reports indicated that hadn't missed anything. Her ship was just performing more effectively than any in the Legate Fleet in the moment. Malificere would know this as well. Would he hold it against her? Or would it be something she could just tease him about? They were however on the same team on the same mission.
Her squadrons had made great time as they performed their reconnaissance. They only stopped after a day or so to refuel. Once they neared the Ebaq system, she heard a report via the bridge vox box. It was a TIE fighter. **—"Malevolence, this is Delta 2-1. We've detected what appears to be an outpost on the moon of the Ebaq system. It is Ebaq 9. The outpost seems abandoned, but we'd like to recon this point of interest. Requesting permission?"—**
Captain Elma looked to Commodore Daiyu. **"It looks abandoned Ma'am. But we must be prepared for anything. Also, there has been an odd delay in receiving the Sector Report from Moff Tunkin. It's likely just natural delay from using subspace frequencies."**

### **zerah** (2013-02-25 16:18:52)

Daiyu sat up a little straighter in interest, she was pleased with how well her squad was running (something she couldn't wait to tease Alvar about later) and how fast they were being while being thorough. It was also good of them to gather up more information as they had been, the prior planets would be good for bases if they need it and good for restock if absolutely necessary. More so, they were perfect if one of the TIE's needed a place to touch down safely if they couldn't get back to the ship.
Now there was an abandoned outpost? she smirked faintly thinking what she would do in Cade's shoes. Finding an outpost for shelter and the possibility of supplies before moving on would be perfect. "Abandoned now." she says softly to her Captain "outposts do serve a purpose without people, shelter, leftover supplies, a hideaway that other would over look." she was grinning and indicated communication to open to the TIE "Delta 2-1, recon the outpost but use caution. We need him alive, and I would prefer calm and willing." 
She glanced back up to the Captain to continue their conversation "I do hope it is delay…it would be a new personal record to piss off a Moff I've only just met in such a short time."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-25 16:26:16)

The Captain smiled. **"Yes, indeed. Fortunately, you did submit the records in a quite timely manner, at least by my judgment."** The Captain then walked to the communications array where there were two officers listening closely to the TIE fighter radio traffic. There was some delay in the transmissions, due to it being burst communication. **"Ma'am, how many TIE fighters will we deploy to Ebaq 9?"**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Currently, all 48 units are deployed. That is your entire TIE fighter element. It's just a question how many you want to send to Ebaq 9 itself. The tactical situation being that the more you send the better armed they are if they encounter a skirmish, the less you send lowers their chances of being detected. Or you may conclude not to send them at all. This could be a very important tactical decision.

### **zerah** (2013-02-25 16:34:29)

Daiyu frowned faintly, resting her head back to stare at the ceiling in thought. She wanted the others to continue searching. However she did not want anyone to get killed over this, or caught...If Cade is there, they will likely be unmatched to him even if she sent twenty. However...this is recon. If he's there, then they can regroup with a larger group after the positive fact...if he's not then no harm.
Small group then. not one, too risky, she hadn't gotten through their dossier's all the way yet, she didn't know their comfort or skill with spying yet. Small but effective. "Send five." she says turning her gaze over to communications and her Captain "if they see signs of life still within they are to withdraw and keep watch and request backup. This is recon, stealth, If he's there and they can reasonably take him, do it, otherwise no chances."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-25 16:50:57)

A radio transmission was heard by the Commodore. ---"This is Delta 2-1. Solid copy on that."---
Then came the silence across the bridge as they were monitoring the five TIE fighters as closely as possible, on standby to send any support possible. The gunnery crews were ordered to fire up the turbolaser converters just in case they needed fire support.
The TIEs reported they were in medium range orbit of the moon. The reported the surface was Type-III uninhabitable, which meant it was without oxygen..but would be fine for a life supported outpost or someone with an envirosuit. Once they were in long range of the outpost, the radio transmission came in to the attentive crew. ---"This is Delta 3-2, be advised we copy life signatures within the outpost. It appears to have medium shield capabilities. Unknown just how many lifeforms are on the outpost. How copy Malevolence?"---

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-25 16:53:01)

Once on the bridge Maleficere looked out the viewport and took a few deep breaths as he tried to calm himself, something he would need for the mission. He could hold onto his rage forever, after all...It was not needed at this moment. **"Send a few snub fighters out and see what turns up….If Skywalker is out there, I want to know about anything that could point to that. The priority is Skywalker, though if we find any signs of Imperial knights…That could be interesting as well. And for those that are going out…here is an extra incentive. The first one to find reports of Skywalker, or anything of interest to me…will get from me personally, five-thousand credits. I am aware that this might be a bit unorthodox, but if it gets results…I am willing to do whatever is necessary to those that serve me and our Emperor well."**

### **zerah** (2013-02-25 17:00:14)

Daiyu sat up in her seat grinning finally.  "How many lifeforms are be read?"  She questions, it was either Cade or possibly Imperials...or both. She needed a count first though.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-25 21:03:34)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Vindicator**</span>
Captain Torvott acknowledged Darth Malificere's command. **"Yes sir. I'll deploy four teams of fighters at once for reconnaissance."** He flipped a switch on a com panel and sent the message to the Squadron Commander. In minutes, Malificere noticed that 12 fighters were launched off the port side. They had moved relatively fast. That was most likely good, for the Commander's sake. Naval operations under Malificere must be kept smooth at all times. As he might have a feeling that Krayt was watching him closer these days. The Sith thought back to his days as Admiral, and suddenly remembered. An outpost. Perhaps a surveillance outpost to leave on one of the worlds? But what size? He had wanted to do so before on Endor. A remote system would make the best option as other electrical signatures wouldn't interfere with the scanning operations. It was an idea he could play with. Meanwhile, he'd wait for reports from the TIE squadrons.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Malevolence**</span>
Captain Elma turned the volume up on the vox so Daiyu could listen to the imperative radio traffic. **—"Roger Malevolence, moving into search formation…Ok, the life readings…we have trouble reading them. For whatever reason I'm not sure. However, I am picking up weak signals on my scope. It could be an estimated 6-20 life forms."—** The sensor crew looked to Daiyu.

As he watched the fighters leave he could not help but think on something that would possibly help. Back on Endor he had mentioned, before that whole fiasco set in, wanting to set up an outpost to extend the Empire's already long reach as well as a myriad of other possibilities and opportunities. The size though was the issue. Something too big would take too much time in their hunt for Skywalker as well as be too noticeable, yet it needed to not be too small so it could be defensible on it's own until help arrived...should it be deemed needed or available...strategic losses and all that Jazz. He would sit and chew on this for a moment, see where it lead him. For now though, he waited patiently.

Daiyu was torn between grinning and frowning. More life forms than she expected, but an issue with getting readings meant they were trying to hide. This was good. But how to go about this? There was a chance that the people there weren't people, could be animals, could be people but be innocents...did she tell them to open fire and risk it and possibly risk Cade? or send a few more fighters as cover and let the first five go in on foot.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-26 15:43:30)

Malificere pondered the thought of the outpost as his ship was in subspace travel towards the next system. He had thought rationally on the subject. An outpost could take considerable time away from finding Skywalker and do simply more harm than good if it were spotted. Being in command always had the nagging sense of weighing your options at all times. Also, he might not like the idea of burst tranmissions. It made it difficult to coordinate with his Fleet. It took hours or sometimes a day to reach them. The HoloNet was instaneous but could give away their position.
The TIE fighter teams were forward of his ship's position and they had just reported a civilian YT model transport on their scope, traveling away from the system.
------------------------------------------
Commodore Daiyu had the solution for this slight problem. She could order the sensor crew to scan the exact coordinates of the outpost. It would require rerouting of power to amplify the sensors for an accurate reading. She could do it herself or have the crew do it. Hopefully it would determine the exact number of life forms.
((Yes the pilots are capable of going in on foot. Their outfits provide life support.))

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-26 15:59:23)

Maleficere blinked as he was stirred from his thoughts before signaling the team to escort the ship to the Star Destroyer. **"Tell them if they allow themselves to be escorted back to this ship's hangar, and agree to a search of their ship, then we will allow them to leave safely. If they argue or resist, fire on their engines and disable them as a warning. I want to search their ship myself…Keep me posted."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-02-26 16:40:26)

Daiyu glanced over to the sensor crew, moving towards them to watch "reroute power to the sensors." she orders calmly "lets get them the most accurate reading possible before we send more." she turns her head to glance over to the communications "Have two of them land, one on either side of the outpost and tell them to be ready to go on foot when we give the word. All others keep eyes on the outpost."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-26 16:54:51)

Lieutenant Hortrin swiveled in his chair in the at the communications console. **—"Sir, Echo 1-1 reports that the YT has not returned communications. It has no weapons armed or shields raised."—**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-26 17:07:52)

Maleficere furrowed a brow before saying **"Scan for life forms. Do not let it jump to hyperspace yet, have half of the scout ships look elsewhere in the area. It could be a decoy. If need be, shoot out their drive core."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-02-26 22:26:08)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Malevolence**</span>
Commodore Daiyu could sense the aura of trust from her new crew as she allowed the sensor crew to go to work. Many times, a new commander would directly oversee any operation of this nature when they were first working together. But they knew she trusted them. Captain Elma reported to Commodore Daiyu. **"It seems there is approximately 12 life forms in the outpost. Furthermore, the outpost was used during the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion in 28 ABY by Admiral Ackbar. The outpost seems to be running at full capacity. All the creatures on the outpost seem to be making direct movements, so they are most likely sentient. They also appear to be reacting to the TIE's landing. What are your orders?"**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Vindicator**</span>
The communications officer turned in his chair to announce to Darth Malificere. **"Echo 1-1 reports the YT cruiser is armed with concussion missiles and quad laser turrets. It is still not responding to the TIE fighters, and is maneuvering away from the TIEs."** 
Captain Torvott turned to Malificere. **"My lord, it could just be smugglers. It may not be worth our time or resources."**

Daiyu hummed faintly in thought, planning for the best and worst cases. "Have another fighter land and send two more to aid in air cover. I'd like to avoid as much loss of life as possible especially our own people." she orders, patting the shoulder of those at sensors for a job well done in getting the new information. "Air cover for the outpost, those on the ground go in and find out who they are. If it's Cade they are to shoot to wound or calm him down; If they are civilians we will leave them…there's been enough innocent blood spilt we do not need to add to it." she orders shifts to better watch for communication with the fighters "and if they are knights…well…we really only need two for information, primary and back up."
She looks over to the Captain "They already know the TIE's are there. Likely if they are smart they believe they will be shot on sight if they attempt to leave the outpost, therefore they will likely respond in our favor to ground communication." She nods "Find out who they are first."

If that's not clear she wants another fighter to land and the three from those fighters to go in on foot to find out who is actually inside the outpost as quietly as possible while two more fighters join the ones in the air as an air support if people run and a show of intimidation.

Maleficere thought for a moment. It COULD very well be just a spice smuggler....but what if Skywalker or some knights were being smuggled out of the area as well...? The decision then became incredibly obvious. Krayt had said he had a lot to learn about leadership, if his next move was a mistake...Then it was Krayt's fault. He had to learn to trust his crew. He also trusted them to know what would happen if anyone of them was the cause of failure, but he would offer them trust this time. **"Very well Captain. Have them fall back and continue their search."**

The Captain signaled to the helmsman. **"As you wish my lord. We are continuing our approach to the Zamael system."** Darth Malificere heard the report and looked toward the transparisteel navigation chart. Two ensigns were marking positions for coordination purposes. It showed all the systems of the Deep Core illuminated. All of his ships were illuminated in red. He saw that in terms of recon Commodore Daiyu was covering space much faster than him. The ship was more efficient and sleeker than his. Was that the case? Or was it her leadership superior to his? Then the captain approached Darth Malificere. **"Sir, the YT went into hyperspace. It also dropped a single crate of cargo from its hold. That is the report from Echo squadron."**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Malevolence**</span>
The communications officer nodded and coordinated the information over subspace radio to the pilots. Captain Elma informed Daiyu that the three TIE's had set down without incident on the moon's surface, and were proceeding to the outpost at this moment. There were also two TIE predators in a medium range orbit providing close air support. The sensor crew, intelligence officers, and communication officers were working diligently to monitor the status of the ground crew...coordinating their efforts for anything that was relevant on that moon to the team. There was a silence, as if they were with the pilots themselves. Then came the report. The communications officer turned the vox up so Daiyu could hear the radio chatter. **—"This is Echo 2-1, on cover pattern around the outpost. Ground team has spotted a duracrete bunker in front of a closed gateway of high walls surrounding the outpost. They are asking for orders. It is the only reported way into the outpost."—**

Daiyu frowned faintly, they had the only known entrance covered, but that also means that the people inside would have element of surprise for them and advantage of being ready for movement. On one hand it could very well be a trap to catch them...she could lose three pilots. Or...they could be hoping to be over looked.
Cade could be down there.
Knights could be down there.
Survivors from the massacre could be down there hiding.
She weighed the options in her head and nodded, it was worth the risk.  "Go in. Stick to walls and shoot to wound hostiles are found…if no hostiles attempt peaceful confrontation." She orders and hopes. If it's Cade and he's healthy..."If Lightsabers are seen, withdraw and cover the entrance." She will not risk this small group untrained against a saber like that.

Captain Elma watched the Commodore as the information was relayed from the Vox to the pilots on the ground. **"This is Echo 2-1. Ground team confirms orders. The team has set their weapons to stun. They are going to move on a wide right pattern and flank the bunker from it's side. Might take a few minutes to avoid the bunker. They'll use the wall as cover to move up to the bunker's flank and clear it out….wait one."**
The sensor crew was scanning the bunker and it's surrounding area diligently. The bridge crew was anxious, yet calm. They remained focus as any Imperial would. Then the vox responded. **"Echo 2-1…update. Bunker is clear. No shots fired. Only a single E-web blaster is in the bunker and it is unmanned. Large blaster packs spotted within. Pilots are proceeding to the main gate to gain clearance."**

### **zerah** (2013-02-27 17:15:27)

No one manning the weapons? this was either civilians who didn't know better, a trap though they haven't seen anything yet to that effect, or...wounded maybe?
Daiyu breathed out a sigh, attempting to let go of some tension as she watched the scanners; The other option was that these were animals that took up the outpost...briefly she wondered if she was being too cautious but dismissed the thought; she was unwilling to lose anyone for pride and to appear fearless. They were crew and family, she wouldn't throw them at will to die. "tread carefully." she said simply. This could be a trap. She hoped they understood that.

Commander Hortin of communications walked over to Darth Malificere's command chair, he offered a quick nod and then stood in imperial parade fashion. **"My lord, we've received a radio transmission from the  *Malevolence* that was transmitted 15 minutes ago. Apparently, at that time they had arrived in the Treskov system-Quadrant Meta 11 and are investigating a moon called Ebaq 9.

Maleficere could care less how quickly Daiyu was covering her system. The bantha-shit fact of Krayt giving her a new ship and not him had nothing to do with that, it was the fact that he simply believed that this was not a race and that he felt slow and steady would get him results. **I want that crate analyzed for any harmful emissions, then I want it brought on board if it is deemed safe.

"I do not like this…but it is the most unusual we have come across and warrants a full look." She looks to the Captain and squares her shoulders, "you have the bridge Captain, I'm going down there."
She turns on her heel to head for the hanger, stopping at her new room to quickly change to a darker recon attire capable to withstand the environment and strapped her saber and a blaster to her before moving to the hanger and a shuttle.
She should have gone earlier, she didn't have a lot of saber training but she had enough to hold her own.
The moment she'd land she'd head straight to her pilots and the control panel, they needed to get in.

Commander Hortrin acknowledged Malificere's command and relayed the information to Echo 1-1. The Commander then listened closely to the information relayed. **"Echo 1-1 confirms there is no harmful emissions or anything to indicate the cargo is dangerous."**
Captain Torvott walked over to Darth Malificere, awaiting his next order. Meanwhile, some thoughts went through Malificere's head. The cargo dump, was typical of a smuggler to drop when spotted by Imperials. But what could be in it? Spice? Death Sticks? Illegal weapons? It was likely some type of contraband. But was it worth even searching? Or was it space pirate trickery?
He then moved his mind to Daiyu's situation. If she needed assistance, he knew their were two ways to contact her. Subspace radio burst or HoloNet transceiver. If he sent messages by the subspace radio, there could be a delay which could prove to be critical. But if he used the HoloNet Transceiver, it would be direct information exchange. This however did run the risk of giving away their position. Someone had to be actively scanning the HoloNet for them, which was possible in this sector of space. The life of a naval officer always had such operations to oversee. He knew it came with the territory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ebaq 9**</span>
Commodore Daiyu set back in the passenger bay of the Nune shuttle. She had grown quite accustomed to this vessel. They were a couple of minutes away and a TIE pilot sergeant was sitting adjacent from her. She remembered that Captain Elma didn't want her on the moon's surface; however, she likely felt her leadership was needed. Especially if Jedi were involved. The sergeant was adjusting the life support chest rig on her TIE pilot flight suit as these thoughts ran through her head. What were the odds of her ever donning such a symbolic uniform? Once they were one minute out, the ensign sealed the black helmet over her face with a hiss. The infrared display came up in her eyes and she saw the entire passenger bay in a different spectrum. Her depth perception and peripheral vision were off. How did TIE pilots fly with something that hindered vision? At least it was low-light.
The landing ramp opened and Daiyu could see the moon craters awaiting her. She descended slowly in the zero gravity environment as the weighted TIE pilot armor kept her on the soft moon surface. At the Oturis Academy she had operated in Zero-G environments before, but it had been a while. Typically, only special forces did actual missions in Zero-G. But she was a Commodore...she was expected to adapt to any situation. She saw the fairly large outpost ahead of her and the high wall encasing the compound. The three TIE pilots were awaiting her.
She heard the helmet comlink buzz to life in her ear. **"Commodore Daiyu? You made it. I'm TI-837. This door has just been giving us trouble. But Echo 2-1 reports no unusual activity around the outpost, and no sign of the life forms yet."**
Daiyu looked through her infrared lenses and saw the control panel. Automaton Industries, the name sounded familiar. She issued a routine bypass code and waited for a few moments. Three buttons turned red, and she hit the center one. It turned blue, and the door began to slowly open. She heard no sound out here on this lonely moon blanketed by stars. It was truly an impressive sight, but she saw nothing but red.
Then the compound was about 50 meters from the main gate. The outpost had two central large-domed and square shaped buildings. It looked to be constructed from durasteel and duracete, with Zero-G composite metals. The main structures had four column passage ways pushing out close to the walls. They looked to be utility wings of some type. They were approaching the first passageway closed by a normal door. This passage way would lead to the two domed structures.
Once the door was open, there was a sterile sealing chamber. The door shut and sealed behind Daiyu's team. A blue light scanned over the team for any contaminants as the room was pressurized. The next door into the outpost opened to reveal a long hallway illuminated fairly brightly. She could remove her helmet now if she wished. The TIE pilots drew their pistols and advanced slowly through the passageway. The function of the passageway was really just a transfer area from the vacuum of space to what appeared to be the main operations building which they were approaching.
Next, they stopped in front of a large circular shaped room which had two stories. The group could see a vast array of computer consoles, storage plasteel bins, tables, and a central elevated mainframe computer that was on a platform. The second story had only one lift at their front as they entered. TIE pilot TI-837 gave the hand and arm signal to ***FREEZE.*** He turned at looked at the Commodore, who might be without her TIE helmet, and awaited orders.

Truth be told, she never really enjoyed zero-G training, she preferred having the feel of gravity on her more than feeling nothing. And she understood why the Captain would not want her on the planet, it could all be for nothing, it could be a trap, but for all the possibilities....if Cade was down here, if Jedi were here, she needed to help. She was the only one on her ship with a saber and some tie to the Force, she had to help them.
She nodded a greeting to the pilot and set to work helping with the bypass code, turning to watch the door open. How did they see in these damn helmets? she felt like she was going to fall over a few times. She knew she could and would adapt but this...this was just uncomfortable.
Still, it was good to be in a pressurized room again. She knew they wouldn't take their helmets off, why would they when it was a benefit for them? She however, took hers off once it was safe, clipping it out of the way and shifting a more handsfree com to her ear attuned to the pilots frequency. The next room was...
She wanted to look at that mainframe, someone might have been using it for messages. But first. She eyed the lift and glanced above "Secure the lift and second story." she ordered softly, no need to speak too loud and give themselves away more.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-02-28 07:17:10)

Maleficere was satisfied for the moment before looking to the Captain. **"I want that crate aboard this vessel. Whatever is inside is now the property of the Empire. Also send a burst transmission to the Malevolence. I want an update on the Commodore's situation."** He was not about to give away his location. If anything happened to Daiyu, then Krayt would have to live with the loss as well as him...After-all, it was Krayt's fault for splitting them up. He she ran into trouble, it was all on Krayt's hands.

Captain Torvott responded with the typical honorific of yes sir. He then went to the crews and began pointing on the holographic map of the crate location en route to Zamael. Commander Hortrin also began submitting the burst transmission, requesting an update from the Commodore's ship.
After a few moments, the Star Destroyer had moved faster than normal to the cargo drop off point. The Captain gave the signal to activate the tractor beam. And after that, something peculiar happened. Lieutenant Commander Guinin reported from his command console. **"Sir, our tractor beam is not finding a lock on cargo drop."**
Captain Torvott looked at the Sith out of anxiety and then rushed to the Lieutenant Commander's station to check on the operation.

TI-837 nodded to Commodore Daiyu and looked into the expansive room. He had his two wingmen take the left and the center of the circular area. The pilot himself began clearing the right side of the room with his pistol, he was looking past the computers and occasionally to the second floor. Once the second pilot was in the center of the room a shout rang out.
**"DROP YOUR WEAPONS!" DROP THEM!"**
Across the circular second floor overlook men began emerging from behind cover, aiming long barreled blaster rifles to cover the entire ground sector of the first floor. The men were wearing composite black/gray armor with transparent visor helmets. The helmets had two dual distinct "fins" on the top part of the head. Not all of the creatures were human; there was a bothan, mon calamari, and two Duros among them. The other species were not wearing helmets. At that time, a shaggy black haired young male, who looked to be in his mid-twenties stepped forward so the pilots below could see him. The Commodore could see into the room but not all of it. She could see about 3 people from where she was in the entry way. The riflemen didn't appear to notice the Commodore.
**"This is Lieutenant Lightvold of the Galactic Alliance Army, 8th Katarn Commando Unit. We've tracked you on sensors and we know you are Sith Empire. We were not going to fire on you but you've encroached on our territory. Drop your weapons, and surrender."**
Commodore Daiyu had heard that name. The Katarn Commandos were SpecForces in the Galactic Alliance founded by the legendary Jedi Kyle Katarn one hundred years ago. They had a proud tradition of taking on near impossible missions, or sometimes even impossible missions from which they wouldn't return. They were among the best trained in the Galactic Alliance, if not the best.
The situation was now fragile. She wasn't spotted as the pilots had been caught trying to secure the area and she was still in the entry way. The pilot in the center of the room looked subtlety toward the Commodore, as to ask if what to do.

Daiyu blinked at the sudden change in the situation. She hadn't been seen yet, and she could hide to ensure that she got information...or should could reveal herself and attempt to remedy the situation to a mutual benefit.
They were a special forces team...what the hell were they doing out here? Frowning she turned her gaze on the pilot that could see her and very subtly motioned him to drop the weapons while she slowly moved to step into the shadows. She could take them out slowly...or just get close enough to the lieutenant.
Special forces...why were they here? she knew them, they only took impossible missions not sitting still at an outpost. There was something else here then...maybe they were guarding.
"we mean no harm to anyone on this moon." she mumbled softly to her com watching the situation. She'd stay hidden for now but she could feed them lines.

The pilot recited the words that Commodore Daiyu had spoken to her. **"We mean no harm to anyone on this moon."**
The Lieutenant removed his helmet to get a better view of his enemy, he then responded.**"Good, then you will throw down your weapons and surrender. This outpost is Alliance territory. No one has to die here. We will take you as prisoners of war, but we will care for you. We will not harm you in any way and you will be well-fed, if you are in compliance with our demands. But you will most certainly be treated humanely, of that you can rest assured."**
The pilots didn't lower their pistols. Commodore Daiyu knew their mentality. They thought like stormtroopers. She had trained as one. Stormtroopers and TIE pilots weren't typically referred to by names. It was only by identification numbers. Their identities concealed by masks. All of this was their nature of complete devotion to the Imperial cause. They would die without hesitation just so the Commodore could escape, or so they could kill the Lieutenant. The pilots would fight to the death and do as much damage as possible if ordered to do so. Perhaps this was the reason Master Ristrin sent them through the Stormtrooper Academy, to understand what it meant to be on this level of devotion to the Empire.

Daiyu moved slowly in the shadows around the edges, throwing out her senses in the force. "What brings the famed Katarn Commandos to an empty outpost." she muttered into the com, edging closer. There had to be a reason they were there, if she could just sense it maybe they could bargain...or if there was nothing...she'd grant them an honorable death.

Commodore Daiyu followed the wall were it was fairly dark. They were on a moon after all and the room wasn't well lit. She could see up now into the second floor, it appeared to be about 12 armed riflemen. Daiyu could see the Lieutenant with his youthful features addressing the spotted TIE pilots. Mentally she could be taking notes, as that would be all the lifeforms they accounted for on the bridge. The Katarn Commandos didn't spot her, or at least didn't say anything about it as she was moving slowly across the room. The computers she had to be cautious around because the faint blue illumination would silhouette her. As she reached out with the Force, she was sure that the 12 riflemen on the second floor were all that were in here.
The pilot recited her next line, to which the Katarn responded. **"You've got quite a way with words for a TIE pilot. I'm not going to ask you again. Throw down your weapons, or will be forced to use lethal force. You're out of range for stun fire. I don't want to spill any blood here."**

Maleficere's eye twitched briefly for a moment before looking on as the Captain perused the tractor beam controls, then looked to the Commander with a nod. **"While we await a response…would someone mind telling me WHY the crate cannot be locked on…? I doubt it could be a hologram…My second question also, is if it could be something dangerous that does not give off harmful emissions…"** He spoke softly, thumbing over his chin in curiosity. Not a trace of anger in his voice, concern maybe, but not anger...not yet anyways.

Daiyu nearly scowled, a dead end it seemed...no Jedi presence, no Cade...unless they were hiding...could they hide themselves from the force? she should have asked Krayt about that. Damn. well....lets see what she could do.
"TI-837, lower your weapons but do not relinquish. If we do not have to kill them than we will not." she says softly into her com, eyes moving up to the Lieutenant she decided it was time for an experiment. Reaching out with the force she sent him a message "Let them go."  gentle, peaceful, calm. She did her best to embody her voice in the force like Awne and Luke sounded to her...like Master, the voices that she trusted.

Captain Torvott walked with a purpose between Commander Hortrin and the system operation crew. He kneeled to hear what they were saying, not bothering to go around to the end and walk down the stairs to the crew pits. He shook his head nervously and stood, straightening out his Imperial Grey uniform to present what he thought might be bad news.
**"Sir, apparently there is a malfunction with our tractor beam. The problem is an internal power failure. Also, the crate could be dangerous my lord. Our sensors cannot pick up everything, especially if the object is inanimate or without power. We need either a bioelectrical field, gas emission, radiation, rare materials, or electrical currents to pick up what's in the cargo.**

The Lieutenant looked around to his squad mates who had their weapons trained at the highly exposed pilots. **"Who said that? Anyone say that?"** He looked confused as the crew all shook their heads no. Then Daiyu caught the posture of the Mon Calamari, he had only looked at the the Lieutenant for a brief instant but retrained his rifle on the crew aggressively. It was apparent he was very agitated.
The Lieutenant shook his head and then focused back on the TIE pilots. **"Follow my commands! I ordered you to drop your weapons! Do it now!"**
The Katarn Commandos heard the urgency in his voice. This was a standoff. He knew he was shouting because the TIE pilots were not following his orders to the letter. They remained calm as they knew if this escalated even further, shots would be fired.

Maleficere simply gave off a shrug. **"Send an astromech droid out to open it, and see if it is dangerous. If it is, then we either lose a droid or it finds the cargo is safe. Also send send a mechanic to fix the power problem."** He was also silently waiting to hear back on the progress of Daiyu. He could only hope right now that she had not run into any problems.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ebaq 9 Outpost**</span>
The Lieutenant looked to the ground and then back up again. He looked left and right urgently while calling out to his teammates. **"Did you hear that? I'm…..hearing voices."**
One of the female squad members asked if he was ok. At that time a TIE pilot began to move slowly to cover. But then the Mon Calamari shouted, **"Don't move!"**
A Duros squad member shuffled a bit to the left and then gave the Lieutenant a firm pat on the shoulders. The Lieutenant then shook his head and regained his composure. **"Must be the Zero-G environment…Ok! I said drop your weapons! Your surrounded! If you keep stalling we'll have to attack you out of self-defense! Katarns, be prepared to use stun grenades! We need prisoners!"**
Commodore Daiyu was still at the wall console, she couldn't move past it but she was about halfway across the room now. The only way around it was to move into the center of the room, but that would expose her to the squad's field of fire. However, the Commodore could estimate from here the squad was surrounding the team from elevated cover. So if there was to be blaster fire, the TIE pilots would be denied cover. The lift was past the console if she followed the wall. But that was risky and would likely expose herself moving past the bright computer. Now they were locked in a stalemate, which wasn't in her favor....unless she thought of something...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Vindicator**</span>
Captain Torvott nodded to Darth Malificere. **"A excellent plan my lord. Move the ship closer to the cargo dump, but keep medium range spacing protocol towards the cargo and TIE formation. We'll keep a safe distance and launch a shuttle with the astromech. Lieutenant Archlan, supervise the electrical disturbance. Ensign Nams, you oversee the launch of the astromech droid."**
Both officers snapped to from their crew pits and ascended the stairwell to the main level of the bridge. They moved past Lord Malificere not making eye contact. Lord Malificere then looked out at the viewport as he saw the Star Destroyer was moving ahead towards the TIE fighters in the distance who were in a holding pattern around the cargo zone.
The ship closed on the TIE fighters formation. They were flying in 3 teams of 4, in a square formation typical of TIE Defenders. The Star Destroyer came to a halt and Captain Torvott began coordinating with Ensign Nams in the hangar bay. A few minutes later, the TIEs moved away from the cargo area and Malificere watched a Lambda class shuttle on approach to the cargo area. Was it just a smuggler dump? It was possible the smuggler was afraid to get boarded or stopped so they could have dumped contraband for that reason alone...or knew he or she would be followed into hyperspace. Anyways, the Lambda shuttle got a relatively good distance from the cargo crate, which Malificere couldn't see from the viewports. And then something happened. Commander Hortrin reported from his pit.
**"Sir, Echo Squadron deployed from the *Malevolence* that their away team is being held at gunpoint on Ebaq 9 by Galactic Alliance SpecForces. The Commodore is with the away team. The total time between our last transmission and their reply was fourteen minutes."**
Metaphorically this situation was like Kamino. There was an old battle quote that the Mandalorian warriors said about the rain on Kamino. He had heard it by one of his instructors at the Oturis Academy. The quote was "Never rains, only pours." He might be thinking that quote was appropriate for now. Here he was handling suspicious cargo and a fleeing YT gunship, and now the Commodore was at gunpoint. The life of a naval officer could be quite monotonous in daily operations, but it had its moments at times like this. But he was no longer an Admiral, he was a Sith. Where was that line in his head between the two tasks?

Maleficere quietly face-palmed and ran the hand slowly down his face before regaining some sense of composure. It figures that Daiyu would allow that to happen to herself. It just figured. Had HE been assigned to that sector he would have sent in an HK and some Shadow Troopers...had they been available, before going in himself. That is what landing parties are for. It made no sense to go down yourself when you are the head of the operation and one of the highest in the Empire. You NEVER put yourself in that amount of danger unless you are certain you will come back out. **"Call the TIE's back to the hangar. As soon as that droid finishes it's job, and the crate is either deemed too dangerous or the shuttle returns with it, we move to the Commodore. We can't really leave them out there anyways otherwise I would say go right now. But that would strand Imperials, and good men and women. Something I will NOT do. I may be a Sith, but I am no maroon-er…and I NEVER leave my crew behind."**

The Captain heard the issuing of the new orders and began moving about the crew pits with urgency. The TIE's flew back toward the Star Destroyer with the roar of their ION engines. He checked with Lieutenant Elvod, a younger Coruscanti male and they went over some navigational charts and calculations. Then something catastrophic happened.
A tremendous explosion erupted from the cargo zone and sent a small shock wave outwards. The crew remained at their posts to assess the situation, liked trained officers. Captain Torvott went to the viewport, then to the sensor crew. **"My lord, the Lambda shuttle survived. We're scanning the explosion zone. There seems to be large traces of detonite. Initial analysis shows it was around 1600 to 2000 pounds of detonite. No damage to report."**
Then, Lieutenant Elvod was standing next to Darth Malificere's command chair; he had navigational information on his datapad and was standing by to give a report to him as he knew speed of the essence with all that was occurring at the moment.

Daiyu did not like the position she was in, she needed to get to that lift if they were going to have some kind of advantage here. Maybe she could distract them. She turned her gaze to different members of the unit above, focusing on each on as she sent out thoughts in whispers and murmurs in the force, like someone was whispering to them:
"He's hearing voices?"
"stress of duty?"
"unfit for command…"
"going crazy.."
she hoped it would be enough to at least conceal give her a small window to move to the lift.

Maleficere blinked in surprise at the explosion. That...that could have been his ship...That could have been all of them. His brow furrowed, his eyes filled with rage.**"Captain. Make a note of this. ALL OF YOU! The next time we see that particular vessel that dropped that crate…I want them brought on board so I can deal with them personally. No one threatens my crew or me."** He then turned to the Lieutenant and took a few deep breaths before going over to him. **"You already have those ready? Good man. What do you have? Also, Captain. I would like for you to send a burst transmission to the Malevolence, letting them know that we are on our way."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Vindicator**</span>
The crew set to work on the communications, most notably Commander Hortrin. He issued a standard message to expect their arrival. As Malificere saw them get to work, the Lieutenant showed him a map of the Deep Core. **"Sir, in order to get to the Ebaq 9 system in a timely manner we'll need to perform a microjump. Otherwise, we'll have to use subspace travel which will last approximately three and a half days. A microjump will take us about five minutes to arrive on destination precisely. However, we will have to perform a unassisted microjump for that result. That will require incredibly precise calculations and navigation preparation. It might be too much for us. Or, we could perform an assisted microjump by flying into the Ebaq system and using the planet to pull us out of hyperspace. Estimated time to arrival from Ebaq to the moon should be about 20 minutes. This option presents much less danger."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ebaq 9**</span>
The Katarn Commandos began talking to one another, saying they were hearing voices as well. But being that they were SpecForces, they kept their rifles and focus on the Imperial Pilots. They didn't however, seem to spot Commodore Daiyu. She got to the small recess that went upwards and noticed that the small lift platform led straight to the second floor. The lift was also on the floor. She would have to call the lift and that would alert the Commandos as they were on the same floor as it and it would be very obvious.
The Katarn Lieutenant spoke again.
**"You have five seconds to comply. Drop your weapons and step away from them! If you do not, we will be forced to open fire."**

Maleficere rubbed his temples on his head for a moment before nodding in understanding. **"We do the assisted. We can't help the commodore if we are DOA. I just hope that we get there in time…or that she has things handled enough for us to get there in twenty."** Then, he said something that was very unexpected...at least as far as a Sith and his crew were concerned. **"Captain, Lieutennant. Both of you are an asset to the Empire. I trust you know that I do not throw compliments like that around very much, but your guidance is always appreciated."** True enough though he would most likely kill them if they made a grave error in this...it being Daiyu's life in their hands possibly, but his words were true enough.

"I'm going to give you an order you are not going to like, but you'll do it anyway." Daiyu said into her com, calling the lift to the floor she was on.
The moment it started to run she said simply into the com "run for the entrance, that's an order." she didn't like retreat anymore than they did but the advantage was not in their favor. If they could get out though..."advantage is outside now go!"

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ebaq 9**</span>
The lift cranked to life with a bone-chilling shift of gears. The Katarn Commandos focused on Commodore Daiyu now at the bottom of the lift. When their attention shifted, the TIE pilots began rushing towards the entry way. Lieutenant Lightvold began shouting orders. **"Flash grenades out! Try to get as many prisoners as we can! The officer is priority one!"**
Daiyu saw the squad above taking cover while some kept their weapons trained now on her. The pilots were now out of their field of fire and they were heading down the pressurization passage way. She figured the ones who had cover were preparing stun grenades to be used. Now that the pilots had withdrawn, she was the only target in immediate view. In essence she had bought time for the pilots to escape, while in turn taking risk herself. It was a noble effort indeed. The TIE pilots had likely never seen something like this before out of Imperial Officer.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Vindicator**</span>
Captain Torvott reported to Darth Malificere the Lambda shuttle had returned and the crew were fine. They had lost the astromech in the explosion however. Lieutenant Elvold then looked back to Helm operation area and back to Lord Malificere. He had his orders and a difficult task it was indeed. The Lieutenant didn't want to fail because this was a risky naval maneuver. As he walked to his crew pit, he assembled his officer and began supervising all them calculating their data. They were all double checking each others calculations and executing hyperspace mathematics. Captain Torvott went to supervise and shook his head a few times. He then gave the Lieutenant the order to execute on the vox and on the bridge.
**"All hands we have an emergency situation that requires a medium risk microjump. This is your job as naval personnel to undergo such situations, but we have a lead on Alliance personnel. Everyone man their stations."**
Captain Torvott then gave the go signal to Lieutenant Elvold as they inputted the coordinates and the Navicomputer sent back a oscillating beep to signal the ship was ready.
Beyond the viewport, the stars changed to starlines as the ship entered the blue luminescent wormhole. Lieutenant Elvod began watching the systems closely, after about two minutes you heard the hull creaking violently and ominously throught the whole ship. The ship then came out of hyperspace to see a horrendous view.
A monumental sized black hole was now in front of the viewport. The ship came to a violent stop and some of the crew were slung around. Captain Torvott checked on some of the wounded but they seemed to be ok. He ran over to the systems operation console. **"Sir, we've arrived in Lima-11 Quadrant. We are approximately one and half days travel from Ebaq 9. We've sustained major damage. The structural integrity of our vessel has been compromised. The hull has been warped out of place by the black hole we are in front of now. Furthermore, life support has been destroyed. We have ten hours left of life support remaining."**
The systems crew also reported that the ship was being drawn in by the pull of the black hole. This was a catastrophic failure in navigation. Now it would still take just as long to get to Commodore Daiyu, if they would even live to see her again.

Maleficere stood riveted with shock and horror. This was how it was going to end was it? Sucked into a huge hole while life support failed. He gave a damning look to those responsible for this catastrophe. He could use a escape pod...Yes. He would do this. **"Send an immediate Holo Net to Lord Krayt requesting assistance. Those that are able, immediately start repairing life support if it can be salvaged. I want every droid available repairing the engines to get us away from this thing. That is an order."** He then promptly took a data-pad and stowed it in his robes before heading at a normal pace towards the escape pods. If he saw others racing for them however, he would book it as fast as possible...and would shock the hell out of them if he needed to insure he got to a pod. Once he would get there, he would simply stand outside and wait. True he'd guard one for himself and a few others, but he had always had a view of 'The first shall be last and the last shall be first.' He got their first...he would make sure he was the lats possible person in the pods....provided things went right. For now though, he had had enough of how things had gone lately. Taking the com from his pocket he tuned in to the ship and spoke to the entire crew for a long awaited rant. **"I know things havent been great here, but once things are done head to the pods if it looks like that is what needs to happen. I will make sure that all the pods are full before launching them. In the mean time, here is something I learned. When life gives you lemons, don’t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don’t want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life’s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give ME lemons! Do you know who I am? I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I’m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down! Let's do it together folks, let's make life take all of our lemons back. Lord Maleficere; we're done here."** After a deep breath, he felt pretty good actually.

Daiyu watched the pilots run, good at least that was one last thing to worry about. She didn't wait long after they had run and the shout from above before she took off running as well. If she got captured fine, her crew could send word and find out from Krayt what to do if they didn't want to take initiative.
Not that she'd go out without a fight mind you, she had a blaster and a saber. For now she ran for the advantage.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Vindicator**</span>
The crew looked about as the lights flicked on the ship. Captain Torvott didn't know what to make of it, a Sith making a speech about lemons? He thought it to be unbecoming. Maybe the Sith was slightly delirious? At any rate, he was enthusiastic and maybe not as evil as they thought. The crew worked hard to keep the ship away from the black hole. At this point the Star Destroyer seemed to be staving the gravitational pull.
Commander Hortrin looked up from his console and shouted out. **"My lord, who are we requesting assistance to? The *Malevolence* or us? Also, the *Frontier* would get here faster if they microjumped. It could be days before someone Lord Krayt sends to get to us."** 
Captain Torvott looked to Darth Malificere and nodded. **"He's right my lord, we are on long range recon. We are expected to be able to hold our own."**
Lieutenant Archlan walked past the Sith and told him he'd handle the repairs of the ship right away after sending a message to the engineering crews.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ebaq 9**</span>
Lieutenant Lightvold shouted out, **"Got the grenades ready? Ok, flash grenades out!"**
Commodore Daiyu heard this coming from as she started running across the room. She saw about four stun grenades land ahead of her as she was moving ahead. The sound of plinking grenades land amongst her was nerve racking as they were blanketing the area around her. She could feel her skin rising as if to expect a massive explosion at any second as she ran across the room.
There is a series of blinding flashes as she ran about the room. But she remained steadfast as she was moving the short distance to the exit. The grenades didn't really hurt. They just sent a tingling and dizzying sensation through her head. It wasn't enough to stop her impressive fortitude.

Maleficere blinked before saying **"So long as the Frontier could reach us and not suffer the same disaster we are in then yes…This ship is not long to stay this way for long, I doubt we could even get her back into hyperspace without vibrating it to pieces."** A thought then occurred to him, again. **"Yes, see if the Frontier can get to us ASAP. In the event they botch it like we did…How many Lambda's do we have in the cargo bay…? I am thinking if worst comes to worst…we can all just board the Lambda's if we have enough. The TIE pilots can go to their ships, and us to the Lambda's and just fly to the nearest habitable planet and use the shuttles as shelter. They have Holo-net Transmission so we could use that to send our location to an actual rescue effort. That IS of course if the Frontier fails…"**

The Lieutenant then peeked up over cover and saw the Commodore nearing the pressurization passageway and heaved a grenade ahead of her so she would get caught in the radius of the blast. Yet another flash went up off her right side. It staggered her slightly but it didn't once throw her off balance. She also noticed a team of four moving to the lift.

Commander Hortrin spoke out to Darth Malificere. **"So you wish me to send a transmission via the HoloNet to the *Frontier*? As you know it may potentially give away our position."** 
Captain Torvott shouted at Lieutenant Elvold. "Full power to engines, full reverse!" He then turned to Lord Malificere and answered his question. **"Sir we have eight shuttles. Are you planning a full evacuation?"**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Ebaq 9**</span>
The TIE pilots heard the order from Daiyu and had cover in the passage way entryway/plasteel bins. They began firing sporadic pistol fire on the four man team advancing down the main area and the mainframe. Lieutenant Lightvold shouted out to his troopers over the exploding stun grenades and blaster fire. **"They are using lethal force! Respond with lethal force! Take their officer alive! Switch to stun when possible for all targets! I'm out of grenades! Bravo team your next on the lift! We'll cover!"**
Commodore Daiyu ran past the TIE pilots who were at the edge of the door way. The blaster bolts were snapping close to the door but the pilots remained calm and returned fire. The team outside advancing on your position had to keep their heads down as they took cover. As the Mon Calamari moved up from cover a TIE pilot leaned out and fired. The Mon Calamari fell to the ground and rolled to cover after being shot in the shoulder.

As far as evacuating, not unless absolutely necessary. But have hangar bay ready and prepped just in case we need to leave earlier than expected. If we can escape the pull of the black hole then that is a majority of the battle won.

Commodore Daiyu peeked out from the doorway and saw Katarns laying down suppressing fire through the door way. They had good cover, but Daiyu was a good marksman. She had to be dexterous and nimble as she looked out and brought her head back instantly. Daiyu had a snap shot in her head of who to engage. Their was a Katarn who seemed to be an easier target, the female grey/black armored human who was sticking out a bit longer than the others. She would lean out and shoot her.

Commodore Daiyu leaped back suddenly from her quick surveillance of the combat area near the main frames. The lift was now going up to retrieve the rest of the squad. Again, she had an image burned in her head of the woman who was firing close to her who was being exposed just a second too long. She breathed and thought of her marksmanship training. Once she had this thought process set and she was calm, Daiyu popped out and fired at the woman's chest. The blaster bolt struck her chest soundly in the armor plating. The Commodore then dropped back into cover at the doorway. She heard something that could be morbidly satisfying. Even though the Commodore wasn't sure the result of her attack, she heard something that confirmed she had hurt their numbers.
**"Corporal Skyria is down! Their leader is well-trained! We're taking cover until the rest of team is down here!"**
After Daiyu had put a stop to one of the advancing Commandos, she saw her team running and coming to a halt at the pressurization door. They were accessing the control panel to the door. Suddenly, a blast door sealed shut on the door. The pilots looked back to Daiyu. **"We'll have to slice it!"**

Commander Hortrin frantically worked at the comms panel, sending another subspace transmission to the *Frontier*. Captain Torvott was also in communication with Lieutenant Archlan who was headed into the Engineering Bay to repair the life support. The maintenance crew were likely already at work, but the Lieutenant was the expert engineer on this vessel. They would need him.
The Lead Helmsman reported that forward motion was slowing towards the black hole, but they were still on approach to the massive and ominous anomaly.

Fortunately, he had faith in the Frontier. He knew Niles would not let him down. **Put all power to those engines! So long as it doesn't vibrate the hull to pieces, I don't care how much power it takes."** He then turned his com to speak to Lieutenant Archlan. **"Would electricity, in any form, help give the engines a boost?"**

Lieutenant Archlan shouted from the forward operation pit that they weren't getting enough power and that unauthorized electrical currents could disrupt the engines. But as the Captain was rerouting power, the lights within the bridge flickered in and out. There was definitely an energy disturbance. The Captain spoke urgently to Darth Malificere.
**"We're transferring all power to engines!! It doesn't seem to be working! We're still waiting for the *Frontier* to receive our transmission."**

The volume of fire was decreasing through the doorway and the walls around it. Two Katarns were now casualties. Where they still in the fight? No way to no for sure, but Daiyu knew she did serious damage to the female. She had given the orders to the TIE pilots but at their line of sight they couldn't shoot because Daiyu was too close to the line of fire. They did however, keep their weapons ready to raise at anyone who would get past the Commodore. TI-837 began work on the durasteel door. Daiyu saw this and leaned out to fire. She fired at one of the Katarns that was behind a computer but the shot impacted on the machine instead of her target. The man did take cover after being shot at though. As she snapped back to cover she saw five men coming down the lift to reinforce the two that were closing in on Daiyu.

There was no shame in ordering abandon ship, though he had to find out one thing first. **"I am aware that the Lambda shuttles have hyperspace cores….I am assuming that means they can travel at light speed? Would our chances be better with those than to stay on board this tub of dead weight? Would we even be able to escape the pull of the black hole in them?"**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-04 23:16:45)

Captain Torvott scratched his chin and tried to keep his composure admist the failing power of the Star Destroyer. "We should be able to break free. They are naturally faster if we use the Lambda shuttles. However, if we abandon ship there aren't enough escape pods for everyone. There will be many lives lost."

Maleficere knew that this could cause a panic, but at the same time he also knew this did not mean those that stayed were doomed. If the Frontier showed up in time then the rest could be saved. In his mind, yes, it was difficult. It was also easy as hell to make at the same time. **"I need a meeting with all key officers, meet me in the hangar. The rest of you, keep doing what you are doing. The Frontier will be with us soon, so be ready to drop and run. Lieutenant Archlan, the nature of this meeting does not 'require' you to be there should you feel you should continue with your help, but you are welcome to attend."** He knew Archlan was no fool and would know what was about to happen, he had only worded it as such to avoid immediate pandemonium....as well as offer Archlan a choice to do what he wanted on the matter. He hoped that the officer would come with them, and leave the others to their fate...But would understand if the male stayed with his friends and crew members. Once at the Hangar he would go into a shuttle and start to warm up the engines immediately, but wait for the officers to show up as he left the ramp down. He was not about to let this infernal thing bring him down. He -would- however...like a very skilled pilot.

Darth Malificere knew that there was a pre-flight log to check on a datapad somewhere in the Lambda Shuttle. He found a datapad secured in one of the compartments underneath the instrument panel. He would have to follow the instructions to the letter to get the shuttle operational. While he was doing the pre-flight checks, he could hear the Lambda slowly buzzing to life with power. He wouldn't have trouble getting the ship on in a few more minutes. And then, he saw Captain Torvott...and other leaders that operated on the bridge. **"My lord, I ordered the rest of the bridge officers to stay at their stations.

Commodore Daiyu poked out and saw something that was now obvious to her. The lift was getting the reinforcements to the first floor. Without the lift, it would be a considerable drop for the rest of the men to drop down. However, shooting the life control panel would be a difficult shot from here. Four other men and the Lieutenant then took cover as they advanced towards the passageway the Imperials were in. The Katarns were laying down suppressive fire all around the doorway in which Commodore Daiyu was in. Some shots were going through the entryway as well. But she knew what they were doing. It was basic strategy. They were suppressing her so they could move closer to inflict more damage. It was basic, but brutal. The Katarns would keep firepower down on her team until they could advance to a closer range to inflict casualties.

Maleficere looked to the Officers that arrived and gave them a solemn nod. **"Understood Captain…But you will forgive me if I do not leave things to chance? I have not stayed alive this long in service to our Emperor without having a backup plan…May he live long. I strongly urge the rest of you to come aboard or get your own shuttle's ready to go should things get worse. One wrong action could send this now useless tub spiraling into the abyss, and it was -one- wrong action that got us in this predicament in the first place. I am not placing blame Captain, simply stating the facts of the situation."** He then commed Archlan **"Do what you need to do Lieutenant. I have every bit of faith that we will -not- need to issue an evacuation."**
He gave a sigh and leaned back in the chair before standing up and moving to the officers. **"I am giving them two hours. Let us not forget that the Commodore and possible future Empress is in trouble. Our allegiance is with her, just as much as it is with Lord Krayt. If we end up leaving before they can get the ship stabilized, then we will send a burst transmission to the Frontier…telling them that we went ahead in a shuttle, but that the Vindicator could still have survived and that their orders to assist still stand."**  a thought occured to him yet again, something that was happening very often now. "**"With all of the TIE's we have…as well as the shuttles, could we not attach tow cables to them and the Vindicator…? To slowly pull it away?

Invictus sat there in his meditation, as he had been for the past few moments since the ship had lost power. He knew that this close to a black hole bad things were bound to happen when the ship was unable to move, so he had been spending his meditation honing the force into a white hot blade of emotion tempered by willpower. The ultimate tool of the force ready to be swung in any direction. He concentrated on the ship, and on his raw desire to move the ship away from the black hole. Despite his strong desire to move the ship away his thoughts drifted to his father
***"Father, I know you have been there for me numerous times in the past, helping me to survive despite all the odds, aiding me with the force. Now I ask you to help me save myself with the force"***
The thought rang through his head with an odd clarity for his state of emotional concentration, and he knew it to be 100% true. His concentration doubled as he guided the force to manipulate the very fabric of space itself. The ship began to tremble, but this trembling was not caused by intense, gravity, but by the force, and as the knew that he had just one more thought for his father
***"You once said that the power to destroy a planet was insignificant next to the power of the force, now help me prove that even the power to destroy a star is insignificant next to that same power"*** 
and with that he pushed the last of his willpower for the moment into that one wordless desire to move the ship and the only other person he had felt a connection to, away from certain death, suddenly moving the ship a good distance away

Darth Invictus could feel the dark void about to devour the entire ship whole. He focused on the Force and what he thought to be his father. The Sith began emanating and manipulating the Force around the Star Destroyer on it's desperate descent. However, he felt the ship was still moving on course towards the black hole. He wasn't even slowing the Star Destroyer down. Had his father's wisdom failed him? What went wrong? How much longer did he have to live? Or was the Force simply not with him?
Outside of his meditation room he could hear that people were shouting and screaming as the hull continued to creak against its own weight from the black hole's pull.

But the Lieutenant responded to the shots fired outside. **"They'll get us in the fatal funnel! Keep suppressive fire down that hallway! Execute maneuver Foxtrot Charlie!"**

With all the other problems accruing, this was beyond dangerous. Not to mention there was nine hours of life support available and the *Frontier* hadn't arrived yet.

I'll need you to use the astrogation computer and see how much power we are bleeding off at this vector. I'll have to compensate the pitch based on the information you give me so I can maneuver out without losing speed."**

As Darth Malificere analyzed the astrogation data he realized they were losing a bit too much power to pull away under the current heading. He had two choices based on his hyperspace and astrogation calculations. They *could* use the black hole and move with it's momentum to pull them away from danger, or they could jump to hyperspace. Hyperspace would be the much safer option, but they would have to overshoot the Ebaq system. Unless they attempted another assisted or unassisted microjump. They all presented great danger. At this point probably, the safest and slowest option would just to keep fighting the pull by sending full power to the sublight engines, unless they did a normal hyperspace jump to somewhere safe.

Malificere thought back to his days at the Oturis Academy. All the countless hours of astrogation and hyperspace mathematics. There were endless hours of study and even advanced calculations on how to do a microjump. He saw the information for Ebaq 9 and saw that it had little gravitational pull. It would be difficult, but he programmed the sensors to recognize the signature of the moon's rich composites after a quick analysis. Now, the navicomputer should lock onto the mineral deposit signals and drop out of hyperspace as soon as it recognized it. He punched the coordinates into the navicomputer and gave the signal to Ensign Narerre.
The stars warped into starlines as they entered the blue and welcoming sight of the hyperspace wormhole. Ensign Narerre was cautiously watching the flight instruments for any disturbances. Malificere was as well, because it was primarily the job of the co-pilot to monitor such tasks. After a few moments, you exited hyperspace.
The moon of Ebaq 9 was directly ahead. Also, the sight of the impressive and imposing *Malevolence.* After all of this chaos, there was Daiyu's superior prototype and pride of the new Imperial navy. Ensign Narerre looked to Malificere with a look of relief in his eyes. "All systems nominal sir. We are green light on operations."

Maleficere saw the Malevolence in his view as they appeared and fought back an urge to growl. **"That ship should have been mine you know…? Lord Maleficere of the Malevolence….Only MY name fits with the name of that ship."** He shook his head before turning to the Ensign. **"Send a message to the Malevolence, get the coordinates for Commodore Daiyu, then have them contact her and let her know we have arrived….without the Vindicator."**

The Ensign acknowledged Lord Malificere's command and used subspace radio to contact the Imperious class vessel. The Communications officer spoke back to Ensign Narerre giving them the coordinates, and that they are in combat with about 12 Katarn commandos on an outpost. The outpost was used during Yuuzhan Vong invasion. 5o the Alliance was here.
Ensign Narerre told Malificere the coordinates and the situation. "Also there are TIE fighters in orbit of the outpost, I can put you through to them directly my lord. They have been in communication with the Malevolence away team."

Daiyu gripped her saber tightly in one hand drew her blaster again and fired at the first target in front of of her "Get the Damn door open!" she shouted to her pilots. She was not losing people to this and he had better hurry the hell up.

The pilot shouted as he fired blindly at the commandos. **"We're pinned down! If we go to the door controls we'll be shot!"** The fire stopped the advance of the Commandos for a few moments by taking cover but then they got up again to advance. As they were moving forward, you saw the black haired human lieutenant enter the hallway with his rifle pointed at the team as well.
At that moment, the TIE pilot who had been shouting in front of Commodore Daiyu was shot by another advancing human commando. He had been shot in the stomach, and he crumpled to the ground. The only two left standing were Daiyu and the TIE pilot. Lieutenant Lightvold shouted to Commodore Daiyu. **"DROP YOUR WEAPONS NOW!"**
His voice was shaking as the intense nature of close quarters combat and blasterfire had set in. This was surreal as each bolt struck down a target, it made your muscles involuntarily jerk.
*((It is now Commodore Daiyu's turn. The commandos are closing in on you, trapping you between the pressurization door and themselves. They are 14 squares away.))*

Maleficere's eyes filled with rage at the situation before telling the Ensign to put him in touch with the TIE's.**"This is Lord Maleficere. I am issuing the Order to destroy anything on sight that is non-Imperial, that tries to go towards that planet…Especially Alliance. Do NOT fail me, or the Commodore."** He then maneuvared the shuttle to land at the closest point near Daiyu's location. **"Ensign, stay here and call down about fifty Troopers. Twenty-five will be back up, the other Twenty-five will guard the shuttle. The rest of you will follow me and Invictus to help retrieve the Commodore."**

At the small systems station on the starboard side of the cockpit, Lieutenant Trysiri turned and faced Lord Malificere. **"My lord, our databanks report that Ebaq 9 is a Type-III uninhabitable moon. We will need envirosuits to travel on its surface."**
One of the ensigns went back to the weapon storage bay at the back of the shuttle and reported that there were none on board. This was terrible news when speed was of the essence.

Maleficere blinked in surprise before effectively losing his calm. **"You mean to tell me, that a Lambda class Shuttle of the Empire, a transport shuttle that can go pretty much anywhere that is not covered in water, does not have ANY enviro-suits….? None whatsoever? From what I remember….my training at Oturis Academy would have prevented situations like this from happening…"** He shook his head before sighing in exasperation. **"I suppose it is worthless to ask if we could just blow open the doors with the weapons on this shuttle and at least give them a way to run out to us?"**

Maleficere looked to Trysiri **"Take over my position while I man the weapons."** He then got up swiftly and moved to wherever the weapons controls would be and waited, with a growing impatience. He knew that Invictus was more patient than him, and idly made a mental note to ask him how he was able to remain so calm in very active situations. **"And someone get in touch with the Commodore dammit and let her know that I and Invictus are personally on our way, and to make sure they have their Inviro-suits on. I don't want them dead because of something -I- did."** He continued to mutter about how in the Force their could be no suits on the shuttle. **"Would it also be possible, for someone to come in and drop off Enviro suits? Or would it not work…If it could work, then go ahead and have the troopers bring enough for all of us."**

Daiyu didn't stop, glad to see that her change in plan and apparently insanity for her own lack of safety in the face of protecting her crew had startled the so called elite force. She made a mental note to attempt to capture as many as possible and see if they might come to their side...with their officer of course.
She didn't stop though, no she simply continued and sprinted the distance remaining, focusing on the hum of battle in her blood and the hum of the force that touched on her instincts to keep her alive and standing and fighting. The moment she was close enough to one she swung at gun arms.

Invictus opened his eyes, his meditation broken by that resonance from what could only have been his father. Logic told him it could have been any of an infinite number of force spirits, but his emotions, the things he kept in control when in reference to any other situation, wouldn't let him believe otherwise. What was it that illogical, normal, people called it? Hope?
Invictus had been listening to the conversation between Maleficere and the pilot of the shuttle and knew how to handle the situation.
***"If I might interject Malificere, I could teleport to the planet myself and bring everyone up to the shuttle, and thus not leave a large smoldering sign that we were here in place of where a door might sit. Stealth is not of the essence but neither is announcing our presence. You would just need to get me within 30 meters of the area they are and I could do the rest"***

Maleficere blinked for a moment before turning to him slowly, with apprehension but curiosity in his voice. **"You mean, to tell me…that you can do such a feat even without seeing where you are going to end up…? As well as bring someone back WITH you…? Invictus…if you can indeed perform such a feat then of course that would be the most preferred course of action.

Lieutenant Tysiri nodded and then got in the co-pilot's seat. Darth Malificere got up from the slightly cramped cockpit chair and slid over one chair behind him that was facing a computer console. Darth Malificere hadn't operated a heavy weapons installment since the Academy. Nevertheless, he was sure the basics would come back to him. He activated the targeting computer and watched as a red screen lit up with yellow crosshairs and a targeting grid. The targeting system had already locked onto the yellow blocks which represented the outpost. He saw two main structures and four wings of the building in which to target. They were still at long range. He would have wait for precision fire. He checked the blaster cannon batteries functionality. The cooling units were ready, turbines charged. He was ready to fire once in range.
Ensign Narerre spoke to Darth Malificere once he had sat down. **"My lord, the troops are loading into their transports as we speak. Their shuttles will take approximately three minutes to reach the surface of the moon. We have an estimated two minutes to target."** The Ensign then turned from the Lambda flight instruments and heard Invictus' words. He didn't seem to pay much attention to it as he went back to his flight operations.

The Lieutenant noticed the brazen attack of Commodore Daiyu and gave out a quick command. **"She's trained in the Jedi arts. Weapons on auto! Fire!"** The Duros saw the flailing lightsaber and backpedaled away from the squad out of instinct. He fired desperately on automatic with his long barreled blaster to repel Daiyu's assault. Daiyu noticed that blaster fire was intense. However, only the the Lieutenant and Duros were able to get off a burst as Daiyu's attack was unpredictable. She was able to deflect the bolts awkwardly into the wall. The Commodore could feel the sizzling heat of the bolts as she was defending the attack just barely. They had fire superiority at close quarters.

Maleficere concentrated on his training. He was fairly certain that he could manage a somewhat well placed hit, and was not nervous in the least. **"And they are bringing the Enviro-suits as requested, correct? If we need to I want to be able to go in myself. I lust for combat, and what better way to get it out of my system than to fry some Alliance scum? They all deserve to die, every last one of them."** He was hungry for blood and death, and desired nothing more than to snuff the life out of those Commandos. He was ready to concentrate on the controls though, all he needed was confirmation. **"Also, someone tell me when we are in range for sub-space. Make sure the Commodore knows that she will most likely need her suit on before we blast the door open."**

### **wizard9660** (2013-03-08 12:09:02)

**"Of course I can. It is a trick of the force along with some additional concentration. Nothing overly difficult. It would be much simpler than blasting the doors open, which could inadvertently harm someone inside if bits of shrapnel from the door were to fire in that direction"** He said calmly, hoping that the exploding their way inside plan of action wasn't really plan A. Invictus knew of Maleficere's feelings for Daiyu though, and knew he had to work quickly to forestall his, most likely, emotional and drastic response to the situation. **"I will begin concentrating now to be prepared when we get within range"**

Maleficere nodded to Invictus with understanding. **"Prepare yourself then. However if you fail, I will be moving ahead with my plan.

Daiyu took a stride forward as her lightsaber hummed and hissed about. The blade waved through one of the arms of the Katarn's in front of her. His left arm was cauterized off as it to fell the ground. The man who lost a limb also took a knee, and the Katarn behind him moved to shoot.
Then she heard it. **—"Pressure door open ma'am!"—** The tie pilot said as he dived into the next room and he took full cover from any incoming blaster fire.
Now that they were locked in point blank combat, only the point men could shoot at Daiyu as to not risk hitting their teammates. The Lieutenant and the Duros fired short controlled bursts at Daiyu. The Lieutenant, as he was back stepping the aggressive Commodore, issued an order to blast the door panel. However, they were not able to take the shot just yet because Daiyu had them on the defensive.

As she closed in, she kept her lightsaber up. She was able to deflect the burst fire efficiently enough, but she had to flail her arms quickly to do so. The Commodore was moving through the attack team with brutality alone. The lightsaber blade was obviously something they hadn't encountered a lot. That was likely why they were using lethal force.

She counted a total of five shooters still left standing after severing the arm of one of the point men. The Commodore didn't need to count, it was just readily apparent in her mind thanks to the Force. She could feel their will to fight. After she had watched one topple, she took a slight hop forward brandishing her blade at a rifleman. This time they began scattering the formation so they could back up. Her lightsaber came up just short of the target, as she had to jump over the fallen enemy to reach the next human Katarn aiming at her. As she missed, she could feel a tingling sensation up her spine as she knew another barrage was coming.
Simultaneously, she heard the TIE pilot shout out to her. **"You must also be in the pressure chamber as well. Unless you want us to be cut off!"**
Lieutenant Lightvold and the rest of the team couldn't gain a clear shot at the door because their was a lightsaber waving from side to side in their face. However, they would continue to lay down burst fire on the advancing swordsman.

As the burst fire came at her, she once again began swatting bolts into the durasteel, zero-g composite walls. Then it happened, a bolt struck her right hand.

This is Lord Maleficere. Lord Invictus and I are close to your location. Now, if any of you Katarn scum harm one hair on her head I swear by the Force I will slay and murder every single one of you, and then go after your families. You are hereby ordered to lay down your weapons and cease fire until we arrive so that we may talk…like civilized beings. Fail to do so and I will obliterate this base! If the Commodore does NOT answer this within ten seconds, I will commense firing and order an orbital bombardment from the Malevolence.

The ensign shooked his head. **"Sir, we can't use a tractor beam on a creature. We are one minute out from target. You should be in personal comlink range."**
Malificere observed the sensor blip. It was moving fairly quickly away from the outpost. But what was the reason?

Lose....?
No...She didn't want to die, there was too much she still had to do, she had to find meaning, find the light, make master and father proud...She had to find Cade....
Darkness was taking her again...
No....No....I don't want to die...I won't...you can't have me yet!
Cade…
No..nononononono
Don't want to die…

**"I meant if it decided to use a shuttle to escape. Have one of the Trooper Tranpsort's follow us. I want to follow it and see where it leads us. It could be the Commodore, it could also be Cade. Either way, it's now too risky to fire on it unless we can find out who it is. Follow it, and have the troopers that are still going to the bunker secure it and search for the Commodore."** He knew better than to fire on the target, not right at the moment anyways. He then used the comms again. **"This is Lord Maleficere of the Sith Empire. You have one chance to surrender Commodore Daiyu back to us, or I and Lord Invictus will take her back by force. If anyone can hear me, you will respond now. I am giving you the chance to do this under peaceful terms. One chance, before you piss me…and Lord Krayt himself, off. I repeat, you WILL respond."**

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Ebaq 9</span>**
Commodore Daiyu regained her consciousness to see herself in a well-lit cargo hold of what appeared to be a space transport. A single human in Katarn armor and a Mon Calamari were watching over her. She was laying in a cargo hold bunk. There was a container of fluids pouring into her arms. It was clear light blue fluid. It was most likely bacta. Her wrists were restrained with binders and her weapons were disarmed. The Galactic Alliance Commandos had taken her in and cared for her, she didn't detect any new wounds.
The Mon Calamari was also receiving medical treatment in a chair across from her. The human hit his comlink. **"Sir, she's stabilized. Yes sir, standing by."**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Shuttle *Thyferrion***</span>
Darth Malificere sent the message via the subspace radio. After a few moments, he heard the comlink being shuffled around. A moment of awkward silence ensued as the girth of the gray moon filled the viewport. Finally, he heard a voice come over the comlink. **—"Sith Imperial Station, we have your officer as prisoner. We will not hesitate to kill the hostage if you threaten the lives of my unit. Do you understand? How copy?"—**
Ensign Narerre looked down at the heads up display as the transmission was relayed. **"Forty eight seconds my lord!"** Darth Malificere heard the chatter from the comlink and then saw targeting information. He was within optimal range to target the six main blocks of the outpost structure. The targeting data was locked in and calculated well. He could fire at will if he wished.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-12 08:05:47)

Maleficere glared at the communications before answering **"I don't think you understood me Sir or Ma'am. That 'prisoner'…is of special interest to Lord Krayt. He would kill us all to get her back…as would I. As for your threat to kill her? It seems to me that your logic is flawed. Once she is dead, there is nothing stopping me from razing this moon to an empty lot in space, and everyone else along with it. It is not a threat, but a promise. Now. Let us talk no more of violence and retaliation. Let me discuss the facts about our current situation. You have something I would kill dearly for…and I want her back immediately. Do not be a fool…whatever your station is seeing as you did not identify yourself, you have TWO Sith Lords approaching. You need not make this difficult. Hand her over. I will even give you a few minutes to discuss. Until then, there will be a shuttle of troopers ready to receive her."** He then turned to the Ensign and said flatly **"I believe I ordered you to fly after that life form as well as have a trooper transport follow us Ensign…Was I not clear…? But have them keep a distance behind us, whichever transport it happens to be."**

Daiyu blinked green eyes up to the lights again, shifting her head slowly to the side to get a feel of what was around her. She didn't hurt...that either meant she was dead or on something really good. The fluids dripping into her arm indicated the latter.
huh….they fixed me up…noble of them.
They were well trained, looking back on the fight, the parts she remembered, they fought well, worthy of the legend that they held about them, strong fighters. She glanced to the Mon Calamari who was also being treated and blinked at him, she got in a few strikes, few..not as much as them but still...it felt good to have been able to hit.
She tested the bonds on her wrists, fairly weak attempt she knew but she also knew she wasn't going to be going anywhere.
"Thanks.." she manged to get out, voice breaking and making her frown at the sound, she looked towards the calamari and nodded at him then the human "For he patch job.." she added on. She knew many Imperials that wouldn't bother with a prisoner, it was...nice, honorable, noble.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-12 14:07:22)

The pilot of the Lambda shuttle acknowledged Lord Malificere's order. "Yes my liege. We are following the life form and we do have a troop transport in formation with us." As he said that he took a moment to monitor his instruments. "Twenty seconds to landing."
Darth Malificere could easily see the moderately large outpost in view now. There were two squared huge buildings with domed composite roofs. They were likely the main areas. There was also 4 wings that extended from the main buildings. They also had smaller domed buildings attached to the passage wings. He saw 3 TIE Predators parked a distance away from the high walls of the outpost. At that point he heard a response on the radio.
---"You are in no position to bargain Sith. Make a false move and she's dead. We're ready for death, are you?"---
---------------
The dark haired human looked down and made sure the bacta was being supplied to the Commodore properly. "An Imperial with manners, fascinating."
The Mon Calamari scoffed at this remark. As if he wanted nothing to do with the whole ordeal.
((Daiyu recovers 4 hp and remains -5 on the con track. No destiny point was used)).

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-12 15:29:20)

Maleficere blinked before looking down to the com. He had a very strong idea of who he was dealing with now, and that only made him grin slightly. "I highly doubt you would kill her, but to be safe, I am not making any false moves..at all. I would simply like to inform you though, that you hold a Skywalker in your grasp. I do not plan on her or myself dying at this moment, but if you value your honor you will let an innocent party leave. All she wanted to do was to find Cade, so she could meet him. I am here for other reasons, but she honestly just wanted to meet him. As a Sith, I know my words to you mean little…but on the Force I swear to you, this is the truth. What would you do, if I offered to take her place?"

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-12 16:24:04)

Daiyu glanced towards the injured one and offered a lopsided and weak willed smile "no offense was meant, battle does not make time for friends or reason at times." she paused there, and wondered if she was actually speaking as clearly as she thought she was. Was she slurring words? ugh she hated having to be down enough for this type of thing.
Her gaze returned to the human checking the fluids and frowned, she had questions, best to start small.
"I did not know alliance would take the time or use the resources on injured captives."
Not really a question there brain..let's try asking one this time.
"Where am I exactly? are we still upon the moon? Did my pilots reach the outside?"
Okay…too many questions at once brain… She made a face, she was sure of it at her runaway mouth. "Apologies." she muttered, as though not trusting her mouth to do more at the moment.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-12 17:15:03)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Shuttle *Thyferrion*</span>**
There was a pause on the subspace radio for a moment. The crew was listening to the communications as well as preparing the landing cycle. Suddenly, as the shuttle was on a slow vertical descent, there was a response. —"While it would be beneficial to have a Sith, we'll keep your officer for now. But perhaps we will take you up on your offer later? But, how do you know she's a Skywalker?"—
Ensign Narrerre spoke to Lord Malificere. "Landing in 8 seconds, tri-wings folding." There it was, Darth Malificere had his answer and they were also setting down with no envirosuits just yet. The shuttle landed on the moon softly as you saw the three TIE fighters that were landed about 20 meters from your position. You could also see the high duracrete walls of the outpost.
Lieutenant Trysiri gave a notification. **"Troop transports are one minute out my lord."**
The forces were not coordinated in the best time window, but it would have to do on an emergency notice. The troopers did load the shuttle in remarkable time, there was just a delay because of travel time. The *Malevolence* was out of optimal deployment range...likely to avoid any anti-aircraft weaponry. However, they could not enter the Type-III atmosphere yet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Ebaq 9</span>**
The male human who was quite young gave a smile. **"The Alliance always collects and cares for wounded, regardless of affiliation…or if they had killed one of our comrades. It is a part of our creed. As our commander said before, we will treat you humanely with three meals a day and shelter. You only had to surrender."**
The Mon Calamari was not pleased at all at this statement. He did not look happy as he blinked his large bulbous eyes and looked at his shoulder wound. Then it made more sense to Daiyu. She remembered shooting the female Katarn...it looked like a fatal shot to her. Maybe she was dead? Maybe he was mourning a comrade?
The human motioned to not worry about the Mon Calamari. He then answered Daiyu's question. **"Yes, we are still on Ebaq 9. The only remaining pilot escaped. Your other two died from blaster wounds. Has the bacta taken effect? You shouldn't be feeling any pain at the moment."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-12 17:33:20)

She nods her head slowly, yes it was working and it would explain the lack of pain, "thank you…" she mumbles softly and sighed looking to the calamari, she had likely killed his friend...and they had killed two of her pilots.
She breathed and closed her eyes turning to look at the ceiling "stupid… shouldn't have run…should have cut them off. Would have been safer…" She said more to herself before looking at the human "would your lieutenant be willing to release them? Or give their tags to the Empire? They're families should know they are gone and left with honor."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-12 17:37:46)

At least that was something he could work with. The conversation had shifted, and it was anyone's game. **"The same way I know I am Emperor Palpatine's son. Their holocron's aluded to it, but each of us has been…contacted somehow. My father was through the holocron, but her…she said that she saw Luke Skywalker on the Vindicator, my old ship. If you will not allow me to take her place….will you at the least allow me to see her?It would also help to establish what I have just claimed. While Krayt has stolen the Holocron, Daiyu still has hers…and I have my Father's light saber."** He looked to the Ensign and said **"And before you say anything Ensign…know that I know fully well what I am doing. I will signal you if I need your assistance somehow, but I need to do this."** If Cade was down there, he wanted to meet this person for himself. Whether to capture him....or to finally put his plans in motion. **"I will do whatever it takes to be by her side Sir. All I ask, is that you work with me so that I may work with you to find some common ground, a tall order between alliance and Sith…but desperate times call for desperate measures as I am sure you understand. As an Admiral, I know all too well that old saying. But as one human to another…I humbly request that you allow me to speak with you, in person, by Daiyu's side."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-12 18:50:30)

Darth Malificere sat in the now quiet Lambda shuttle cockpit. There were the occasional beep and whir of the instruments when finally a response came in on the subspace radio. **—"A Skywalker? Emperor Palpatine's son? What are you talking about?! The only known heir to the Skywalker's is Cade. Palpatine had no heirs ever recorded. But as far as dealing with you, we are not permitted to negotiate with Sith. As to why, we have our reasons. We may contact you again. If you would give us your capital ship's transponder code."—**
Lieutenant Trysiri turned and shook his head. **"A painfully obvious trap, my lord."** He then took notice of his sensor display. **"My liege, detecting three significant energy sources in three of the passage wing structures. It is a power buildup. Most likely star craft."**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The human looked at Daiyu and shook his head. **"That depends if our Lieutenant can authorize that. We have their bodies and are going to search them for intelligence. Other than that, rest assured the bodies will receive respect."** He then turned his attention to another one of the male humans who was of a fair skin complexion. His arm had been severed and it had a crude cybernetic replacement, at least for now. The human attending her was obviously some sort of combat medic.
Commodore Daiyu heard the space transport engines power to life. They were definitely going somewhere. But to where was the question. The two wounded commandos she saw seemed to be dealing with the pain. But the ship powering up seem to raise their spirits; at least slightly. She had the feeling they were a close knit team because of the way they talked to one another and the loss of their comrade seemed to be understood by the medic. A curious bunch. She had really never been around SpecForces units except maybe the fact she was unofficially a Royal Guard. Unofficially, but she still knew she was trained by Master Ristrin as an elite.
Their presence could be seen as slightly inspiring to remember her training. Maybe she would think of a way out? Or maybe the comfort the Alliance treated her with would be eerily interesting? It was certainly a contrast from the Imperial Viewpoint and the harsh living conditions she had known for her whole life. She was always in charge of others well-being, and now her enemy. Her sworn enemy, was in charge of her life...and they bore seemingly little ill-will.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-12 19:20:59)

Maleficere furrowed his brow before signaling to the Ensign. He leaned over and said with a long sigh **"Have the Malevolence Tractor beam them if the owner of that power signature tries to leave, and bring them aboard. Once that is done, have them search for Daiyu. They may not negotiate with Sith, but an Ensign or ship Captain of the Empire is a different matter. The priority is Daiyu's safe return. I do not want that jeopardized. Their threat is obviously a ploy. They would not kill her. If they do, then to hell with them. We can always blow that transport to hell. See if you can catch just how many life forms are on each, the one that has an extra or more…Tractor that specific one. Give the command immediately to the Malevolence once it is done."**
He then turned back to the coms **"I am afraid that is a negative on the transponder codes sir. A token of good faith though would go a long way. Obviously you would not leave a prisoner on a moon that is being orbited by a Malevolent class Imperial vessel…So no doubt the power signature we are detecting is three shuttles about to leave. I would advise against this, but I of course, having no say in this matter, leave that up to you. As for not being permitted to negotiate with Sith, that of course is no doubt that you work directly for Cade and he has advised you not to do so. I will ask one final time. Allow me to board one of those shuttles and go with Daiyu to wherever."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-12 19:22:08)

Daiyu took notice of the change in those in the room, frowning at the feel of engines humming to life. She looked to the field medic for an answer while her mind warred with her sense of justice and honor. She felt the need to apologize for the loss of their comrade for the loss of the one's arm, but she didn't feel too sorry, it was battle...they survived, she respected that.
Still...this group...was all alliance like this? She wished she could ask Luke but...he only ever showed up when she wasn't hoping for him, Cade would be the only other person and she didn't even know where he might be.
She turned her gaze to the medic then the other two "Do…any of you, know Cade Skywalker?" She looked to the medic after "where are we going?"

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-12 22:22:59)

The subspace radio had a slight delay and then there was finally a response. ---"You are not permitted to join your comrade. The Sith cannot be trusted."---
Ensign Narerre relayed Darth Malificere's orders. Then, Lieutenant Trysiri looked up from the sensor display. ---"The transports are 48 seconds out! Wait one... Power surge."--- The Lieutenant then stood and pointed out towards the outpost. One space transport and two fighters were hovering above the open domed structures.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-12 22:56:52)

Maleficere glared at the single transport that had the fighters around it. **"Tractor beam that transport now, and I want those fighter's out of commission. Retreat our shuttle, as fast as possible to the Malevolence. I want that ship aboard the Malevolence as soon as possible. Have the ground troopers go in, and if possible place detonation charges…after making sure that there is nothing of importance left behind. Preferably I would have our own fighter's engage theirs. If that can be done, before their power gets back on, do it. But that is the shuttle I want to be placed in our tractor beam. Ignore the other two, but track their hyperspace trail should they make the jump."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-12 23:35:57)

Lieutenant Trysiri and Ensign Narerre confirmed and carried out Malificere's orders. The shuttle lifted off and turned towards the Malevolence's location.
"We're tracking the transport and coordinating the information to the Malevolence. Setting up for tractor beam. Troop transports landing in 10 seconds." Lieutenant Trysiri spoke to Malificere as he closely observed the sensor console.
-----------------
The human medic then checked on the Mon Calmari's wound; applying some snyth flesh. "I can't tell you where we are going. And unfortunately, no one in my unit has met Skywalker. He is quite reclusive and rebellious. I figure you might know more. And oh yes, are you a Sith?" The medic questioned Daiyu as the ship was clearly in motion.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-13 06:38:03)

Daiyu sighed faintly, watching the human work; it was amazing how...relaxed this whole atmosphere felt even among those that had captured her. Was this really Alliance? or was this a special ops thing?
She had a feeling they wouldn't be able to discuss where they would be going but, it was always worth the chance to ask. His question though made her look to him in confusion "No…no I am no Sith, I'm sure there are at least two…perhaps three that would wish me to be but I am not." She blinks at him, curious "Why do you ask?" She didn't know enough of the two, Jedi and Sith to make a decision on her path with the force, she was certain Master, Krayt and Alvar would prefer her to join them in the Sith ways but...Father held a strong influence on her, she would not make a decision until she understood what...what he had told her, find the light. She still wondered if it was metaphorical or if he meant the Light side of things.
All the more reason she wanted to talk to Cade. Shame they didn't know him.
"Are all skywalkers like him?" she asks curiously "Did you ever know Luke?" she paused and thought on that...memory...from long ago "or…or Mara?" That was her name wasn't it? that was what he called her, Mara. Mara Jade

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-13 08:25:40)

Maleficere was nervous. What if the transport was a decoy? Worse still what if it wasn't and they killed Daiyu? Could he live with himself? He doubted that Krayt would commit suicide out of grief...they should only be so lucky that happened. He shook his head. Daiyu knew the risks of an officer, as did they all. Had she killed Krayt when she had a chance this situation could have turned out better. They could have been married by now, and could be ruling the galaxy. Still, no use worrying about the past...Concentrate on the moment, and seize the day. His word was final, and he would not retract it. If they saw he doubted himself, how could he ever hope for their trust? **"Keep me informed Ensign. Well done."**

The command crew of the shuttle listened upon Ensign Narerre's order, and manned their stations as well. After a few moments, a subspace radio came in from the Malevolence. Ensign Narrere turned in his chair as he was guiding the ship back to dock.
"My Lord, the Malevolence has a radar lock on the transport but they are just out of range of the tractor beam. Furthermore, the two TIE units in orbit of the outpost are awaiting orders."
---------------------
The medic made sure the wounded had their crash webbing secured after he checked the Commodore's. Keeping the wounded secure was a top priority for him. "Well I am required to ask. After all, you seemed to be lethal with that lightsaber." The medic said and then paused. "I only know of one Skywalker and he seems very different than those along his family line. But Luke and Mara? I only know them from the history plasts. And that brings me to my next question. If you're not Sith, then what are you?"
The Mon Calamari kept his bulbous eyes locked onto Daiyu. For some reason he had been eyeing her with uneasy intentions.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-13 14:48:44)

Daiyu smirked and chuckled "I trained with it…granted it was mostly with a holocron but still…training is training." Her gaze slipped from him to the Mon Calamari as she talked, feeling the gaze on her and frowning while she listening. She questioned him with her gaze even as she answered the human. "I don't really know, neither Sith nor Jedi, no formal training for either and sort of…floating on my own, learning what visions say to me."  she frowns and thinks back to Awne, she had hopped to find Cade and take him to see the farghul, that the two might learn from her and that Cade might teach her as well...two masters in this would be better wouldn't it? father would want her to learn from his own line wouldn't he?
"I suppose…I'm wandering." she adds in thought "finding the light like he said and figuring out if I'm his daughter or if she had died long ago." when she threw childhood away in the desert in order to survive...

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-13 17:06:16)

Maleficere nodded in understanding. **"Have the TIE's get close enough that they can attack the fighters once they start moving. We will worry about the Tractor beam once the shuttle starts to move. The TIE's only attack if the fighters do. I do not want that transport getting hurt or damaged…not unless it's necessary, and even then the most damage I want is a shot out engine. No hull or structural damage, just the engines if need be."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
The medic took a moment to relax as he washed his hands and leaned against the bulkhead. **"So that makes you, a Force Adept? Is that correct? Someone who adheres to an unspecified philosophy of a Force tradition, but still utilizes and believes in the Force? So why are you with the Sith Empire then? It doesn't add up."**
As to interrupt the conversation, the internal vox came to life in the cargo hold.**—"Two TIE fighters closing in, Predator class. Prepare yourselves. Go to battle stations."—** The medic stopped and looked around at the patient's, checking their demeanor. He then looked to Daiyu. **"Are those your friends? They are going to fire upon us, even with you on board…right? All Imperials are expendable. That IS your doctrine."**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Shuttle *Thyferrion***</span>
Commander Hortrin, who was manning the communications relay, acknowledged the order. **"My lord, I will coordinate the *Malevolence* and TIE fighter elements. I'll adjust them on your command. As of now, the *Malevolence* is still out of tractor beam range. The TIE fighters are closing on the fleeing Alliance convoy. I'll notify you of the situation as it unfolds."**
Darth Malificere heard this information as he leaned back in his chair and thought about the craft he saw leaving the outpost. He had studied them earlier on in his career. They had two I4 Ionizer Starfighters and a YT-2400 space transport. He knew the I4 Starfighters were not specifically designed for space combat maneuvering (dogfighting). However, if the YT-2400 was modified it could easily be capable of space combat with starfighters. Typically, the Alliance did not use the YT-2400 for that role, rather it was used for troop and cargo transport. He got up and double checked the databank next to Lieutenant Trysiri. Images popped up in HoloNet form in front of him, revealing their visage.

There was information that he searched for that he wanted to make sure of. He confirmed the I4 Ionizer's were capable of dealing significant system damage to any target, including capital vessels. However, they were still just starfighters. They were slower than TIE Predators at any rate. But they could outmaneuver the Predators if they had a good lead on them. The YT-2400 was obviously slower, but if it had combat thrusters and enhanced weaponry it would put up a significant skirmish to the TIEs. He had the information, now how to apply it? Or was what he said good enough already to get the task accomplished? At any rate, the convoy was currently escaping. Lieutenant Trysiri saw that Malificere was focused and broke his thoughts. **"My lord?"**

### **zerah** (2013-03-13 18:25:46)

Daiyu frowned at the information, her ties were going after a transport? What was her captain thinking? She moved, not easily, and struggled to sit up intent to find some form of com's. She was certain they had taken hers, but her crew needed to know where she was and stop them from attacking.
Still, she answered him voice tight as she forces her body to obey her "I understand your reservations about the Empire, I understand your support for the alliance, I am adept I suppose but I am part of this empire because i was born to do so." She winced and bit her lip at flashes of pain through the bacta haze "we were never offered a choice of sides, only raised to obey and follow what our master had told us, therefore, empire….not that it's doing well but he'll one day someone will listen to reason and see the benefits of both sides." She was becoming more aware that lack of pain was making her chatty...huh...odd.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
**"I see, so you are a conscript? The Sith Empire is known to use strategies. But it seems you might have some sort of resentment towards them."**
His sentence was cut off and he noticed she was attempting to sit up. **"No, relax. You have the bacta apparatus attached to you. Your knee needs to remain stabilized. I'll need you to remain lying down."**
Again, Commodore Daiyu might feel the binders on her wrists that impeded her movement. Her body was being numbed and it wasn't a bad feeling. But it was tranquilizing her. She likely wanted to be an officer and find a solution, but she was almost blissfully being lured into captivity.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-13 18:43:49)

Maleficere was jerked immediately from his thoughts. As their shuttle got closer to the Malevolence he turned to the Lt and said slowly, still in thought. **"Have them only engage the two fighters, and have the rest of the TIE fleet of the Malevolence on stand-by. I want them all to be ready if those fighters are modified. But first, have them simply try to push the shuttle back towards the Malevolence. If -we- are able, I would like to hail the shuttle myself…..to see if the Commodore is on board. If that is not possible, go with the first part…and we can just bring it in forcefully."**

Daiyu pulled at the bracers fighting against the killing from whatever else was in the bacta "I need to get up, they need to be spoken to and I must find Cade first." She looks towards him fierce determination glowing in the green of her eyes he first braid and father swinging past her ear "what I have against the Empire is my business and I aim to fix it, but right now I need to leave and I need to get back, and for ancestors sake get these blasted shackles off!" 
She hadn't struggled the entire time before but now that she remembered, placed so much attention to Cade, to her crew, to her new ship and Krayt and Alvar she had to get out. She had to be the first to reach Cade!

Commander Hortrin looked down at his communications panel and gave the signal to ready the TIE squadron on the *Malevolence.* He then swiveled in his chair to update Darth Malificere. **"TIE element reports they are almost within long range firing position. They are closing on the Alliance convoy. TIE element reports they are flying low to Ebaq's surface. They are going to attempt to angle the convoy into the *Malevolence's* flight vector. However, the *Malevolence* is still at ineffective tractor beam range. I can attempt to patch you through to the transport. Opening channel."**

The medic held his hand up and shook his head. **"Please stop. You are in our care now. Relax!"** The Mon Calamari saw the sudden movements coming from the Commodore and put a hand on his long-barreled blaster rifle. He was wounded, but probably more than capable of handling someone unarmed and secured. Then, the internal vox repeated in the cargo hold.
**—"TIE fighters moving into firing range; crew members man the laser turrets. Hold fire unless fired upon."—**

Daiyu shook her head, she had to stop this, she had to get out and find him. How could they mot understand this? She looked to the Kalahari and frowned at him "you would fire on an unarmed and restrained person? I believed the alliance better than such barbaric tactics" she narrowed her gaze at him and looked up at the sound of the vox and struggled more she had to get out and so something.

Maleficere looked to his station and spoke clearly to those on the transport. **"This is Lord Maleficere of the Empire. I request to speak with Commodore Daiyu before this escalates any further. I do not want to order obliteration, but I will most certainly do that if I do not get to speak with her right this moment. If she is NOT on your vessel…you will tell me which one she is on, and I will let you live. I extend this courtesy only once. I already spoke with one distasteful fellow…who said you would kill her…Not something you want to say to a Sith. Now, will you -allow- me to speak with her? Or do we need to shoot out your engines."**

There was a bit of silence before there was a response on the subspace panel emanating from Malificere's position. **—"You're right. This doesn't need to escalate. My units will only fire if you fire at us. We wish only to be left alone. I understand you obviously want your officer back, but this is your war. She is a prisoner of war and will receive fair treatment, rest assured. Don't make us defend ourselves."**
Lieutenant Trysiri gave a quick notification as the ship was still on course to the *Malevolence.* **"The TIE's are closing in. They'll be in firing range momentarily…are they cleared to fire at long range or do you want them to get closer?"**

The human medic went to make sure the Mon Calamari was calm and then turned to face Commodore Daiyu. **"Stay down. You aren't permitted to leave this cargo hold. Furthermore you might only hurt yourself on that knee. Detainees must not speak with their friendly units, it is dangerous to us."**
The Mon Calamari kept his hand on his weapon but leaned back in his chair, to show a less threatening posture.

Maleficere held up his hand slowly **"Have them hold back…just until I say different….and have the Malevolence track their hyperspace trail if they make a jump."** He then responded back to the man piloting the shuttle. **"You do your station credit Sir. I have ordered my TIE's to hold back while we…talk. I respect you having a prisoner of war. At this point, all I wish is to speak with her. If you can do that for me, then I will allow you to leave. It is not my intention to harm your vessel Sir….merely to get one last SMALL conversation in with my Fiance'. Regardless of what you know or have been told of Sith…we still have hearts as well as emotions. My superiors may not. But I am certain that I do.

The medic was trying to calm the Mon Calamari down when Daiyu ripped the tubing connected to her arm and leg. The medic shouted no and the Mon Calamari stood up to cover his rifle on Daiyu.
Daiyu swung out of the bunk and placed her feet down. She stepped forward to run but her knee gave out. The bad knee along with the sedative effects made her lose her balance.
((Daiyu roll 1D4 for falling damage)).

Commander Hortrin confirmed the two TIEs were in a holding pattern. He then turned to Malificere as the radio continued to transmit. ---"I'm afraid you may not speak with her. It would be a breach of our security protocols. Otherwise, I would allow it."---
There it was, the truth. Then after that news, Lieutenant Trysiri reported the convoy was getting further away from the TIEs and the Malevolence.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-13 21:21:36)

Maleficere gave a sigh. **"Tell her then, for me, that she had better behave."** He then signaled the LT to have the TIE's move to attack, after he cut the transmission. **"I tried to be reasonable…I did Lieutenant. Where did it get me? Nowhere. Take out the fighters, leave the ship alone for now…unless they can effectively shoot out the engine first….WITHOUT causing fatal damage to the ship itself. If it's too risky, concentrate on the fighters for now."** He leaned back in his chair and ran his hands down his face slowly. This...was not a happy time for anyone it seemed. Why should he be happy though? The life of a Sith was, as it seemed lately, all about service to Krayt. Why? What had he ever done to prove what he did was better for the Empire? What did Krayt EVER do to gain the throne? He usurped. An admirable action, but next to his own claim it meant nothing more than poodoo. HE was the heir...HE would make their own destiny now. **"Blast those fighter's out of the sky…and have the Malevolence start moving this way to pick up an engine-less transport after we dock. It should be ready by then."**

Daiyu fell but she'd gone through worse and Damn it all if she wasn't going to get off this shipboard back to her own, she was going to find Cade and being a captive would not help her there. She staggered her feet putting her weight to her good leg and just about hopping to the door, she looked back before it closed "sorry, but I can't stay here." She stated and left turning to look foe the electronic lock to give her some time.

Commander Hortrin relayed the orders to render the transport a mobility kill. If not, to destroy the fighters. However, the TIEs were further away from firing range now. They would have to close distance once again. The transmission was cut from the subspace radio. The Malevolence was also losing the convoy by the reports. At this moment, reports indicated that they were being outmaneuvered.

The medic witnessed the Commodore's tremendous fortitude as she stood up and regained her balance. "Stop! Lay down!" The medic instructed the Commodore. Again, the Commodore felt her strength waning as she moved to exit.

Maleficere sat with his arms crossed. He had a contingency plan to get her out if this one failed. It would require more time by far, but not much. **"If this fails, I have another way to get her back. It will require us to re-visit the Star Forge and retrieve the Farghul known as Awne. Her power in the Force would most likely be able to pinpoint Daiyu, and get us past whatever we need to overcome. If the only option ends up being to let them get away, then that is fine…But until it gets that way, we fight to cripple.

Commodore Daiyu was now walking to the exit of the cargo hold. At this point, the medic was quicker than her and got in front of her. He was holding his arms out to grab her if she attempted to go through him. **"Stop it! You can't move across this ship! Not in your state!"**
The sound of laser cannon explosions could be heard near the hull as the ship rocked gently. Daiyu had to refocus to gain her balance. Were the TIEs really firing at her ship? Nevertheless, she'd have to push through the medic with her weakened strength.

A sudden truth dawned on Maleficere. He had no clue whether she was on the shuttle...or a fighter. "**Have the TIE's stop. We have no idea which vessel she is on…Seems we have no choice but to seek out the Farghul. Have the TIE's return to the Malevolence.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
The medic took a moment to reflect. He looked down at the ground. **"I believe you've been through a lot. Perhaps you at least deserve to talk to the Lieutenant. Tekol, let's escort her to the cockpit."**
The Mon Calamari didn't like this at all, but he kept his rifle at the alert posture. They opened the cargo hold door and escorted Daiyu across the steel grated floor and crude inner workings of the YT passageway. It was certainly not as sterile or well-dressed like any Star Destroyer she'd seen. They arrived at the cockpit to see the Lieutenant and one other flying the vessel. She saw past the viewport as they were flying low to the moon's surface. The Lieutenant shouted. **"What in the Force is she doing here?! Explain yourself!"**
The co-pilot, the Duros, interrupted the Lieutenant and told him the TIE's had broken off the attack. The Lieutenant then looked back for a brief moment. **"Imperial officer, what strategy are they using? We are no longer being pursued?!"**

### **zerah** (2013-03-14 06:52:54)

Daiyu breathed a silently sigh of relief to finally have things moving the direction that she wanted, leaning onto the Medic for support until reaching the cockpit and turning her gaze on the lieutenant with a frown, rude much. She could understand of course but still, compared to the medic he was just...rude.
She turned her gaze to the view and hummed faintly, thinking, The captain had likely given the order to attack, she didn't know how many other ships were in flight but there must be others or this would have been simple so....she frowned "I would guess they aren't certain where I am.." which means she was likely not on something obvious...lets see...if there was a transport ship they wouldn't attack that because that would be likely so...she must be on a fighter. Clever.
Her gaze returned to the lieutenant "As for why I am here it is to inform you that you will be returning me to my ship, on good graces because our fight has never been with you nor your team, your team is admirable in their fight actually, quite impressive and bedside manner of your field medic is astounding." She nods to the medic "however I have things I have to do and I will do them and I need to find someone first, and more than that my ship is up there without me and if I don't go back to it that means that a certain Sith will take command and like hell I'm letting him touch it or my crew so put me back on board and I will let you go, hell, I'll even stock your rations and restock your medical equipment before you leave, but you are going to take me there whether I have to take do it myself or you do it for me." Her hands tighten to fists for a moment, to both control herself and redirect pain "So easy way where everyone wins, or hard way. your choice, I'm being very kind here."

Maleficere noticed the hesitation and narrowed his eyes ever so slightly. **"Do not mistake this action as cowardice…Those alliance members will die. If I know Daiyu, she will not willingly let me assume command of her ship for long. If I know her…which I do, she will be more than capable of taking over, and delivering them to us herself. As soon as they are on their way after releasing her…The Malevolence will fire their turbo-lasers at them and obliterate them."** Another hesitation like that and he would have to kill someone. Even a split second's hesitation in a dire situation could cost lives. It would not be tolerated again.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-14 12:03:33)

The Lieutenant looked back at Daiyu and saw that she was serious. "I see the bacta has taken effect. It's a wonderful creation, huh? You are clearly not thinking straight and your words are slurred. Please go back to bed. Sergeant Tevok, see this Imperial back to the cargo hold. We'll be entering hyperspace momentarily if we can avoid anymore Imperial entanglements."
The Mon Calamari ushered in a semi-threatening manner with his rifle for Daiyu to go back to the hold.
-----------------
Commander Hortrin immediately corrected himself. "Yes my lord, of course." He said as you saw the Malevolence looming into view.
Lieutenant Trysiri turned to Darth Malificere. "What about our troops my lord? Do you want them also to return to the Malevolence?"

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-14 12:08:17)

Maleficere shook his head. **"They have a job to do. All data in that building is now ours. It comes with us. Have them get it as soon as possible, then blow the entire structure to pieces when they are in a safe range. That is when they will return to the Malevolence. Then, we set out for the Star Forge once the Commodore is back on board. Just in case though, remind the bridge that I want their hyperspace trail tracked if she is not able to take control of the ship she is on."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-14 14:03:38)

Lieutenant Trysiri motioned to Commander Hortrin and then he coordinated the ground forces. The Commander announced to Malificere. "Stormtroopers deploying now. We'll keep you updated."
After a few moments, the ship landed in the vast hangar bay. Whatever personnel had the time had gathered here in formation to greet the Sith Lord. He then saw the middle-aged Captain hurrying up to him, he was moving in the opened ranks of the formation.
"My lord, it is an honor to have you on our ship. The Frontier reports hyperdrive damage near the black hole anomaly, but they are all fine."

### **zerah** (2013-03-14 15:36:18)

"Screw slurring and bacta effects do I say, I know you can see that I am not making idle threats or promises. I am a woman of my word and I hold honor high. Take us to my ship and I will fulfill all I have said." she glares at the Mon Calamari "I swear to my ancestors all men are like this! how does this continue to happen I swear on my honor!" her fists were clenching again, forcing awareness elsewhere to combat the effects of the bacta "Safe passage to my ship, new rations, new medical equipment for your journey, proper medical treatment for your two comrades! All I am asking in return is to take me to my ship."  She turns to the medic who seemed the only one with any sense "You can see the benefit of this deal can you not? I am not out of my mind I speak the truth!" 
She eyes them all "What would you have me swear upon? I have no family to swear on their heads, my master was honorable at times but my father is known to be, I will swear on his force spirit!"

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-14 16:26:40)

Maleficere thanked the Lieutenant and sat mostly in meditative silence the rest of the way to the Malevolence. At the news of the Frontier he then gave a sigh before rubbing his head. **"Your words humble me, Captain. Does the Frontier need assistance? If not, our priority is the safe return of your Commodore….which will require a detour to the Star Forges if they move into hyperspace. If that happens, the plan is to track their trail. Once that is done if it turns out that way, I will require a meeting in the briefing room with you and anyone else that the Commodore trusted that is a Bridge officer. I will explain more on that later. But right now that black hole is a concern. I lost my ship and possibly my Captain, as well as nearly all of my crew to it….I would prefer to not abandon Niles and his crew to that same fate."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
The middle-aged Captain certainly looked like the years hadn't been so good to him. However, the clean cut nature of the Imperial dress uniform made him just as sharp as anyone. The Captain intended to live up to that standard. The Dark Lord probably estimated that he was second in command on this vessel due to his vast experience, but he probably never made it up the ranks due to never having been outstanding as an officer. The Captain walked alongside Darth Malificere as they went down the finely polished black durasteel flooring flanked by stormtroopers, naval officers, naval crew, and pilots. Malificere knew there wasn't anything quite like the Empire en masse. Their uniforms perfect and high profile, they served as intimidation to any enemy they faced. All of this was Malificere's now.
The Captain began to update the Sith. **"My lord, Commander Niles reports they have the situation under control. He began repairs on the ship and began searching for survivors. They recovered around a dozen escape pods from the *Vindicator*. There are a total of 25 survivors as of now.**
Captain Elma took a moment to pause and then spoke solemnly. **"However, the *Vindicator* was lost in the black hole. Furthermore, we are continuing our pursuit of the Alliance Convoy. You withdrew the fighters, but do you wish us to continue pursuit? They are evading us at the moment."**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
The Lieutenant adjusted the pitch of the space transport as Daiyu witnessed they were beginning to approach orbit. The squad leader of the Katarn's was beginning to lose patience. **"As an Imperial Officer you should know you are a prisoner of war. I don't know why you're trying to convince me to accept your demands, but you are in no position to bargain. We can't have someone as important as you return to enemy lines after having seen us. That's absurd. I believe you are stalling us. Corporal Tavker, take her back to the cargo hold. We'll be in hyperspace shortly. Get her out of here, now. And you should know better Corporal to let a prisoner roam free on the ship."**
So that was the medic's name, Corporal Tavker. The Corporal tried to speak in his defense. **"I'm a medic sir. My job is to save lives and treat them humanely. If letting her be heard would ease the pain, I felt it to be right. I will escort her at once sir."**
The Corporal tried to let off a half-smile as he firmly grabbed Commodore Daiyu's binder cuffs and escorted her from a rear escort position. The Mon Calamari would move forward as cover back to the cargo hold.

### **zerah** (2013-03-14 20:57:20)

Daiyu struggled pulling back on the cuffs "Let me go dammit! I demand that you release me! I have to find him first! How do you people not understand this! Let me go I have to find Cade! Corporal you want to ensure I am not in pain then get him to understand! I will not let a Sith retain control of my ship and crew and I can't have Cade found without me!"
She struggled all the more digging her heel in as beat she could "you people are supposed to respect the name Skywalker! Let me go!!"

Do as we say."** He then began pushing her down the passageway back toward the cargo hold. The Mon Calamari was doubly cautious now.

She thought and made a dash for the hall away from the cockpit, there was more than one way to stop a ship.  She thought darkly and started looking quickly for the engines, stop them cold and her ship could catch them, disable the hyperdrive and they'd be even easier to pick up. She was not going down without a fight, and they had no idea who they were messing with.

Maleficere was impressed with what had come into his possession, temporary as it was. It showed though on his face that he was pleased with the state of everything that he was seeing. The mention that there were survivors made his mind feel somewhat at ease and even more so that the Frontier was going to be just fine. **"Once their repairs are done have Niles go to the sector that we had previously been in, and continue the search for anything of importance about Cade Skywalker. Relay that I do not want him to engage anything, only observe as stealthily as possible. Communicate in short bursts and watch out for ships that drop cargo…nearly got my ship blown up by a black hole for that…If I hadn't sent a droid out at first. Should he find anything, he is to report his findings to myself…and only myself. Not the commodore if she returns by then, just me. That is not a request. I put my faith in Commander Niles, and you, on this. As for pursuing the vessels, yes. Until they make a jump into hyperspace or turn around towards us we continue after them. I have faith in the Commodore's combat and stealth prowess. We continue on this course for now. Keep me abreast of anything you see."**

Commodore Daiyu began running on her bad knee. Fortunately for her, she didn't feel any pain because of the bacta treatment. However, she wasn't sure what kind of ship she was on. She had ran away from the cockpit and ran about 5 meters into a living area complete with a small table and lounging chairs. A Katarn was sitting there and the person saw the fleeing Imperial and asked her to halt immediately. However, she didn't know where the engines were! She'd have to guess where to go as this ship was transport-size. A wrong turn would prove critical in getting caught or disabling the hyperdrive. The Mon Calamari and Corporal were just around the corner. She had to keep moving and find her way instantly.

The pair were now at the end of vast hangar bay and the crew remained at attention as they walked through sturdy double grey doors to the main *Imperious* passageway.

The Sith thought on this for a moment before nodding his head. **"Best to get things over with. If there is anything new to report on pursuing the Commodore while we are in the meeting, I want to know about it at once regardless. Have them meet me there in about ten minutes. I believe I can find it myself…Also make sure Lord Invictus is set up with whatever he requires."** He then nodded to those present before setting off for the briefing room to prepare for the meeting. All in all the crew of this Impressive and massive ship was proving to be very well mannered and quite agreeable. Granted his own crew was nothing to scoff at...but he had the distinct impression that Krayt had given him a lemon crew to begin with. This...would need to be corrected. On his way to the room he also thought about Ristrin...He missed that man. He honestly missed him and could really use just some words, any words, during this time...even if it was just hearing one of his stories or old tales of legends of old. He had never really expected that man to die back then, and certainly not in that fashion. What would he say now if he could see Maleficere, or Daiyu? Would he ever get to speak with him as he had done with his father...?

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
Commodore Daiyu ran her thoughts in her mind just as quickly as she moved down the cramped and crude interior of the space vessel. She ran into a circular walkway which had a ladder leading to both the top and bottom of the ship. That was a turret access way. The engines should be all the way around the back. Basically, she knew it would be opposite of the cockpit so she kept moving around the circular short path until she found a small doorway.
She opened the door way and saw in front of her a 12 foot wide and 12 foot wide long room. There was a large L-shaped storage shelf halfway into the room. It was loaded with supplies and maintenance tools. Past that that shelf, on the bulkhead, was an escape pod. On the left bulkhead was a machine workshop table. At the far end of the right bulkhead corner was a console attached directly to the bulkhead. It seemed to be displaying various power levels and subroutine checks at a glance. And closest to her right, was a chair. The door remained open as three Katarns came right behind her.
It was the one who had seen her in the living suite, the medic, and the Mon Calamari. Two of them had blaster pistols, and the Mon Calamari had his long barrel blaster rifle. **"Stop now. You are under our custody. Accept it. Do you want to cause more trouble?"** Corporal Tavker was being more firm with the Commodore now.

"Absolutely." she grinned in response, she wasn't moving quickly she knew that but she just had to get inside. Crossing the threshold old the door she turned to the panel working quickly with bound hands to get the door to lock, taking deep breathes to calm herself and focus her determination.

The weapons were being pointed at Commodore Daiyu. She looked briefly to her right and stepped to the side. The naval officer got a good look at the door panel; turning around and inputting a few commands. The door sealed shut with a hiss/clank and was locked. After the door was locked, she inhaled deeply and calmed herself. Now was her chance to escape. She just had to evade them for a little bit longer. The Commodore heard shouting outside the door.
**"I'll open the door, weapons on stun! Breach and clear!"**

While Daiyu was catching her breath and assessing the composition of the room; the door opened and she saw the Mon Calamari step right in her face with his long barreled weapon aiming in on her.

The Mon Calamari then looked down and discharged a blue wave of energy that struck Daiyu's stomach. It made her waver a bit, but her resolve was indomitable. She had to see Cade, get her ship back...all her endurance training from Yinchorri was kicking in and her vision grew hazy. She then witnessed another Katarn move into the room to get into a flanked firing position next to the Mon Calamari. He fired a blue stun wave at Daiyu as well.

This energy wave was less effective as it grazed her arm. But she still felt the mind numbing pain. She knew the medic would be in the room shortly to help incapacitate her as well. The Commodore was so close to the escape pod and closer to the computer, but she'd have to walk through a hail of stun fire. Was it worth it? Or did she have some kind of chance?

As they walked to the main turbolift of the finely polished viewports and advanced computers of the bustling passageway, Malificere realized this ship was certainly much sleeker and sophisticated than the *Imperial* II class. It was quite similar to the *Adjudicator* he had lost under his command. Captain Elma acknowledged the order to adhere to Invictus' orders and any updates on the pursuit. He left Lord Malificere to his own devices as he comlinked the bridge personnel.
Lord Malificere was on the Bridge Deck on one of the higher levels of the *Malevolence.* He walked in the briefing room to see an M1 Protocol droid already preparing caff for the meeting to come. The room was pristine in cleanliness and the military briefing table was polished, even down to the control panels for the officers various tasks that arose during a meeting. All of the bridge officers were accounted for and Captain Elma was standing at the entrance to greet the Sith. The viewports to the side of the briefing room looked out to see the silvery moon of Ebaq, were those Alliance scum were fleeing.
The Captain gave a brief report. **"All key bridge personnel accounted for. As of now, The Alliance Convoy is still evading us my lord."**
He ushered Lord Malificere to the end of the table at the back of the briefing room. It was a chair of authority. It looked down the entire row of the aristocratic officers, waiting to obey Malificere's command as if it was from the Emperor himself. This was certainly a better conditioned ship and crew that he had seen on the *Adjudicator.* Did the Commodore get the ship into this good of an upkeep? Or were they already like this before being retasked to Malificere's fleet? No matter, there were important matters to discuss at hand. Malificere might start with reports from officers, or just start telling them the way he wanted things done. After all, he wasn't an Admiral anymore. He was a Sith. All he needed were perfect results, not reports.

Daiyu wavered at the stun beams and has to quickly think about revising her plans, she was little match for them both at the moment, unarmed as she was. She was good at hand to hand but it would only tire her more and she has to get out.
Plan B it is. she thought to herself, shifting about to work at the cuffs, she wasn't that far, she could make it to a pod and get the he'll out. First the cuffs. Ands get to the damn pods.

The Mon Calamari witnessed that Commodore Daiyu was starting to reel. **"Didn't know Imperial officers were this tough!"** He aimed again, this time at chest level. He was hoping to have a more desirable effect on target with his stun blast. Then the medic walked straight into the room and saw the team firing to subdue the Commodore. It was a close quarters battle with a helpless yet very resilient opponent. The team began opening fire in unison to hopefully take down their opposition. Each stun wave fire sent an echoing noise through the bulkheads as the blue light illuminated the engine room.

The Commodore felt the tranquilizing effects come upon her as it began growing dark. All she knew at this point was to run to the escape pod controls. She sprinted with every ounce of her being and stopped right in front of the controls. She reached her bound hands out and saw the glimmering red and blue buttons that represented a beacon of hope in her darkened vision.

She ducked down to push the central button control of the escape pod and saw the sturdy doors open. As she was doing this she felt another blast strike her back. The Commodore stumbled and fell into the padded g-cushions of the escape pod as the door closed. Then she sat up in a near comatose state, unaware of her surroundings.
She reached over to punch in the commands to launch the escape pod, but before she could do so...the escape pod door opened again. The Mon Calamari leaned into the escape pod and discharged a blue wave of energy. The Commodore's vision went black. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Maleficere certainly did not care for reports...He felt they were long winded. Short and simple, and just the facts were all he ever needed...and perhaps a bit of underhanded strategy. He motioned gently to everyone as he moved to the seat of authority. **"Please be seated."** he said before sitting himself. **"I am beginning to wonder if it would be better to simply surround the three ships with all of our own, and try to contain them. The alliance is weak-minded and would never slaughter a captive…So there very well could be minimal risk. I believe though that they would employ a farce…and not place her on the shuttle, but one of the fighters. It would certainly help them fend off enemies better than just a shuttle. If anyone has a way to figure out WHICH one she is on, then perhaps we stand a chance of ending this pointless chase even sooner. Does anyone have any thoughts?"**

She had almost made it, she had gotten inside even with her vision going dark but that damn...that damn calamari. She had enough energy left to make a comment at the others surprise that she was resilient and couldn't help the defiance in her smirk or her tone as she said simply "I'm a Skywalker." before her world once again went black.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-15 21:06:05)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
The committee of officers congregated with another in a quiet and professional manner. Some of them drinking caff to refresh themselves. The occasional gentle rattle of cups being set down could be heard through the half-silent briefing room. And all of a sudden, the Captain rose from his chair. **"My lord, you are correct that it is a pointless chase. I believe we should not use anything more than starfighters to pursue them. If they should escape, what do they gain? Commodore Daiyu will never reveal any intelligence to the enemy. Now that we're onto them, I doubt they will lead us to Skywalker. They could lead us right into an Alliance fleet as a counter-ambush. We're Imperials. We know that we are expendable, and she knew that as well. As of now they are evading us, and they can go into hyperspace as they please. We cannot commit full resources to save one officer."**
The officers around the Captain seemed to be in agreement. They didn't show it, but there wasn't a word of dispute to be heard across the table. The Sith had known the Imperial aristocracy all too well. When they were silent, that means they were content with matters.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-15 21:22:22)

Maleficere simply leaned back in his chair and gave a sigh. **"So be it then. Have the TIE's make one last ditch attempt to shoot out all three ship's engines. When they go to Hyperspace…have them fall back. I had hoped this would end differently, but we have our own orders to fulfill as well. Perhaps this is simply the will of the Force for the moment."** He then ordered the TIE's to scramble with the objective of disabling all three ships or at least the two fighters, but to fall back if they made it to Hyperspace. He then turned to the officer's once again before growing grimly serious. **"In light of these events, I am formally and immediately assuming command of this vessel. While Commander Niles searches for Skywalker…I have a different approach I am taking. Our mission is currently to head to the Star Forge. There are things that need doing and a very powerful and possible new ally to gain for our Empire. Once there, all power will need to be diverted to the shields…as the Automatic defenses will no doubt kick in. I have those coordinates and-"** He paled quite considerably. Could Awne have survived that onslaught? He remained silent for a moment before regaining himself. **"And we will be heading there as soon as this is dealt with. Be warned. This is an extremely dangerous venture…as it was due to Commander Niles' targeting data that we were able to do sufficient damage to stop it's attack. We will need to perform the same or better if we hope to survive…"**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-15 21:57:40)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
One of the officers named Lieutenant Ardprin confirmed he would ready the TIE fighters right away. He also posed the question to how many ships would be deployed. The Captain had a pale look across his face then spoke up. **"My liege, our orders are from Darth Krayt himself to find Skywalker. I'm sure if we are going to change the mission you are going to contact him and tell him what we are doing. But what is this, Star Forge you are speaking of? It sounds extremely dangerous."**
The crew seemed interested as they had never heard of something like this before. Lieutenant Ardprin then gave the order over the com panel to be ready for launch.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-15 22:09:24)

Maleficere gave off a smirk before saying **"This will actually help us find Skywalker. This sole person will be able to help us find him, perhaps even persuade him to come to US. She is that strong in the force. As for how many ships are to be deployed, no less than half."** The Sith then answered the question of the Star Forge. **"To put it plainly, it is a weapon…as well as a tool. It will serve the Empire well, and that is all I will say for now. It is merely by fate that this powerful individual happens to be currently on board it. But rest assured, we will be doing exactly as Lord Krayt commands….which is looking for Skywalker. He trusts my methods, as it was MY methods that led to the destruction of Bastion. Also, is there any update on Commander Niles?"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-15 22:27:05)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Lieutenant Ardprin acknowledged the order and told the squadron commander to launch immediately. He then looked to Lord Malificere and confirmed that 26 units were being deployed. The others were to be put on standby. The communications officer, Commander Ohek spoke up at the committee. **"The *Frontier* is still scanning for survivors, they haven't found anymore as of yet…they are continuing their sweep."**
Captain Elma then looked at a datapad and sent a short message to the bridge. **"My lord, it seems the Alliance convoy is still evading us. At this rate, we calculate they should be able to enter hyperspace with no problem."**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-15 22:40:31)

Maleficere new when he was beaten, but it would not stay that way. **"Then it begs the question of why they have not yet…Doesn't it?"** He thought for a moment before saying **"I had hoped to see that all of you would appreciate my resolve to try this hard to rescue her, mainly because of how well she treated you. She would have given her life for any one of yours or mine…But seeing as they are still evading us, and seeing as how time is short to find Skywalker…she would also see the wisdom of your advice. Call back the ships. I would also like to know what the troopers on the moon have found so far, if anything. Once everyone is back on board, we set out for the Forge."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-15 22:48:37)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;"> The *Malevolence*</span>**
Lieutenant Commander Lobaoth, in charge of ground force coordination; had a datapad in his hand with information written down. He read it and then looked up to Lord Malificere. **"The ground team reports mainframes and computer storage units were destroyed by blasterfire. Whoever was down there, was in a hurry to destroy items they left behind. Their search however, is not complete. Would you like them to expedite or take more time?"**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-15 23:01:19)

The Sith had all the time in the world really...so why not? **"Have them be thorough. There has to be useful amidst the junk…If they were in a hurry, something must have been missed."** He then looked around for a moment before standing. **"I believe we have covered what needed to be…Unless anyone here has any questions, this meeting is adjourned while I meditate. Any developments are most welcome during this time however, anything that comes up could be of the utmost importance."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-16 06:52:28)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
The command crew began leaving one by one. Some of the officers finished up their caff and engaged in idle chatter before returning to their posts. Lieutenant Ardprin and Lieutenant Commander Loboath waited patiently to get Malificere's attention. The Lieutenant Commander reported the stormtroopers were now clearing the west wing of the moon's outpost. They had rations, consumables, and starfighter supplies to last for 3 months by their account. But the supplies in that wing were only for one starfighter. Lieutenant Ardprin informed Lord Malificere that the ships were on their way back to the hangar.
Once on the sophisticated and sleek bridge, he saw the singular command chair. It was unoccupied. No doubt it was used by the Commodore frequently. Or was she the type of Commander that was always on her feet? Did she monitor every task with intensity? Then the news came across from Captain Elma.
**"My lord, the convoy has entered hyperspace. We've lost them."**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
Commodore Daiyu awoke in the same cargo hold as she did previously. This time, she had three sturdy crash webbing straps on her body, along with the binder cuffs to her front. She couldn't move at all. It was extremely uncomfortable, but yet again she couldn't feel any pain. The medic was overlooking her.
**"Look who decided to wake up. And to think, I was actually starting to trust you. You refused our commands twice now. I'd advise against that in the future, now we're in hyperspace. There is no escape. Once you're a bit more stable the Lieutenant will want to speak with you."**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-16 10:28:20)

At the news Maleficere simply slumped into the chair gracefully and looked around. **"I've changed my mind I believe. I will inform Lord Krayt of what happened once we reach the Star Forge. Captain, have the troopers bunker in to where the supplies can last them. Helmsman, I have the coordinates…But we will be exiting hyperspace a bit away from the actual structure so that I can see if I can contact who I need to speak with inside the Forge without fear of being attacked by it. As for when we leave, as soon as the TIE's return to their docking bay."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-16 14:18:34)

Daiyu sighed loudly as she looked up at the medic "can you blame me? Honestly? Were you in my place wouldn't you do all you could to get back to your crew?"  she sighed and didn't bother trying to fight, she wasn't going to get out of this now or escape in hyperspace.  "I am not untrustworthy, rather like you which speaks much as I really hate medical. You could teach them a thing or two about being comforting though."
She closed her eyes a moment and breathed, "sorry for causing you trouble though." She glances slightly around "where are your trigger happy friends?"

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-16 15:48:43)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Lieutenant Commander Loboath and Captain Elma coordinated on the new orders for the stormtroopers to garrison the outpost. The naval officer then approached Lord Malificere, letting him get a closer look at the Captain's aging features. **"How long are we going to garrison the outpost?"**
Suddenly, An attractive young red head female walked up to Lord Malificere, datapad in hand. She possessed ivory features and a face that told she was naive, intelligent, and cute. Her figure was well shaped from her rounded upper body to her posterior. The naval gray uniform still complimented her body. She likely did physical training quite often. There was no doubt she performed admirably in the Naval Academy. She had a slight smile and an energy about her. **"My lord, an honor to meet you. What are our coordinates? Does the Captain have them?"** The woman looked around as if throw off a bit by imperial protocol, but remained professional nonetheless. Darth Malficere might be wondering what her name was, but did he even care?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
Corporal Torvek nodded his head, all the while attending to her leg. **"I don't blame you. Everyone has their allegiance to pick in war, you made your choice…as we all did. We all kill if we have to…we all ultimately commit to bloodshed for our cause."**
As she mentioned trigger happy friends, the Corporal gestured over to two others. She saw the Katarn who had his arm dismembered from the lightsaber injury. He was sitting in a chair with a medical apparatus attached to his pre-cybernetic prosthesis arm. And then there was the Mon Calamari, also sitting back to ease the pain on his injured shoulder. It seemed the Commodore was receiving priority treatment in the Med Bay.
**"I'll be honest with you. I don't like the condition of your left knee. You must be incredibly strong to have ran on it the way you did. I'll wait to tell you about it until the Lieutenant arrives. You damaged it more by moving on it. He should be here soon as we are underway in hyperspace."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-16 16:58:57)

Daiyu frowned as she looked to e pair "allegiances change and merge throughout life, but we always move to those that have been true till the end…" She mumbled thoughtfully, turning back to him, strong? She'd lived through hell, if you went down you stayed down, she remembered the desert...
She shook her thoughts away and sighed "not the first time I've done horrible damage to myself…you should look at them." She nodded to the pair "I know my saber made a clan cut but cybernetics take time and it would be better if he had full range of an arm again soon, the other should make sure that no serious damage was done."  She looked to the medic "not that I'm trying to tell you how to so your job, but they deserve priority, not me."  She motions her head at him in a grin filled shooing motion. She always prided herself on not being a normal imperial officer.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-16 17:03:47)

Corporal Torvek paid attention to her words. "They'd be inclined to agree with your assessment of the triage. However, you are an HVT. We need you in good condition to speak."
The Mon Calamari was visibly growing discontent. He seemed to not want to talk to Commodore Daiyu at all.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-16 21:15:42)

Daiyu frowned, "knee can wait a while longer, not like I can do much at the moment…or escape anywhere in hyperspace…or really attempt to fight you two off again successfully." She nodded to the pair "and stop looking like I'm going to eat you or something." She says to the calamari before looking to the medic again "you said yourself that your lieutenant would be coming by soon. Go and tend to them."
She sighs softly again attempt to get comfortable "I didn't have a choice, by the way, for reference. In my allegiance."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-16 21:24:09)

Maleficere looked to the Captain and said **"Not too long…maybe a month or a month and a half…on second thought, I would ask your opinion. Do you believe it wise to continue to search in the structure? Or to just call them back. One's drive to do the best they can, can in the end be the cloud to their judgement. No one, not even a Sith is perfect Captain. We thrive on success, but it is due to our crew that battles are won. We are brilliant at giving orders, but only through others are our goals achieved. It is a curse, as well as a boon. Our powers are great, do not mistake that, but even a Sith can fall to a large army of troopers."** He offered a smile to the red-head as he said this, before moving to her. **"Our coordinates…are with the Helmsman my lady. Though I would ask what your rank is, as well as your name…Clearly someone of your boldness must be high in rank?"** This woman...intrigued him. Not for her obvious beauty, but for as he stated her boldness....and why did she wish to know if the Captain had the coordinates...? But by the force she was fit and lovely...

Corporal Torvek nodded his head. **"You'll have to forgive our Mon Calamari friend here. He's been a bit bitter as of late. But yes, there is no reason to take this personally. But your leg, honestly it concerns me. Would you like something to drink or eat?"**
At that time, the door to the cargo bay opened up. The man dressed in gray/brown Katarn armor walked into the room. His shaggy black hair was a bit scruffy from combat. He went over to Commodore Daiyu's side and pulled up a plasteel crate, he took a seat. **"So, where shall we start…..Commodore?"** Well for one, he was able to ID Daiyu's rank by looking at her chest.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
The Captain took just a second to think as he looked out toward the silvery moon, then back to Lord Malificere. **"It depends my lord. How is our timetable looking? If we have time, then we should conduct a thorough search. As for leaving them, it could serve as a worthy outpost to monitor nearby systems and hyperspace traffic. It could be another point of reference for our search for Skywalker."**
After that, the perky Lieutenant responded to Lord Malificere. She rendered a salute. **"I'm Lieutenant Shanica Dryhek my lord. It is a pleasure to meet you."** Darth Malificere stretched out with the Dark Side. He felt fear around him among the crew, that was to be expected I guess. But this woman, was oblivious to the Sith's presence apparently. Her presence in the Force was virtually invisible however.

"I do appreciate your concern, really, please though look after them for a while?" She was sincere in her request, she didn't take well to being treated first over others, more often she'd hide out and wait before submitting to treatment just to make sure that others were treated first.
At the lieutenants entrance and questioned she turned to him, not very surprised that he knew her rank but intrigued she had thought alliance and empire had different rank insignia. "well, how about where are we headed? And perhaps your knowledge on imperial rank?" She voiced it as polite questions, there wasn't a need to fight things now, better to just go with it for now. She does turn to the corporal again smiling at him "thank you for the offer but I'm alright for now."

Maleficere would have to watch this woman very closely. **"We have time to spare for the moment Captain. Our possible informant on Skywalker will not be leaving the Forge anytime soon. As for the stationing of the troopers, it is a grand idea. Once they are done with the sweep, make sure that they have enough rations to suit their numbers. Once that is done, then we will make our way to the Forge."**
He then looked to the female for a split second before offering her a nod in reference to her salute. **"The pleasure, Lieutenant Dryhek…is all mine I assure you."** He then looked around before dismissing them. **"Lieutenant…stay behind, if you would. I would like to speak with you privately in the briefing room? There are a few questions I would discuss and a fresh face is most welcome for these things. As for your current duties, fear not. I am placing you off duty until the discussion is complete."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
The Lieutenant ran his hands through his hair and spoke. "I cannot disclose our destination for security reasons. As far as rank structure, well that is a secret as well. I trust you'll forgive me, right?"
The young man took a moment to look over her knee. **"You've put up quite a fight on that bad leg. You must be exceptionally well-trained to give my commandos a tough time. I have questions, if you don't mind…are you open to that?"**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Lieutenant Dryhek looked around at the emptying briefing room. **"Yes, your highness. How may I assist you?"** She had an innocent smile for an Imperial, she must be fresh out of the academy.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-16 23:41:13)

Well that was new...no one had ever called him highness before...well..no one since Yinchor anyways. He wasn't sure how to handle this, yet he would not correct her this one time. **"You seem….new. Not that new is a bad thing. I just like getting a feel for my crew. Can you tell me about yourself? When did you graduate the Academy…?"** He had a bad feeling that her innocent smile could very well get him in hot water...Yet he could not take his mind or eyes off of it. Out of all her other lovely attributes...her smile was the most intriguing. Shaking his thoughts away he motioned for her to sit across from him, as he sat not at the seat of authority...but rather the seat in front of the window and offered her the one across from him. If anything, it was a rather informal discussion it seemed. **"And…If I may ask…why is it you seem less nervous around me than the rest of the crew…? Not that I mind. I actually enjoy when others are not nervous around me."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 00:01:18)

Their was a cheery smile in response to Darth Malificere. "Because my lord, I'm living my dream. I always wanted to see the galaxy! I graduated the academy about five months ago. Being amongst the stars, is unbelievable. The Empire showed me the way. I never thought I'd serve on such a sophisticated starship. The thrust to weight ratio far exceeds that of any Imperial class cruiser with a hyperdrive dynamic of .75. The ship is ran at twice the proficiency of the more robust models with a quarter of the manpower. It has completely changed the face of Naval Astronomy. I am a part of history!"
The smile was genuine. It was as if she didn't knew what she signed on for.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 08:56:30)

This was getting to be a bit much. How could she be this damn cheery? He had best set her straight. **"Well Lieutenant…while I am glad that you are enjoying your time here, I certainly hope you realize that this is not all happy and warm feelings….Just recently, as I am sure you are aware, I lost my ship The Vindicator to a black hole…"** He then stopped himself before continuing. It wasn't right to scare the poor girl, not when she was feeling so happy. It would be a good feeling for her to remember in the times ahead. **"But that was just a freak accident. The galaxy is extremely impressive, much like this ship."** He leaned forward and gave a charming smile. **"And I for one am glad to have such an energetic Lieutenant…Miss Dryhek. The others could learn from you…and perhaps, I might as well."** He caught himself eying her chest maybe once or twice during the conversation but was able to tear his gaze upwards. Had it...had it suddenly got warmer?

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 09:25:40)

Daiyu sighed loudly, rolling her eyes even as she laughed "oh more secrets, here I thought I'd have gotten away from some of that." she grinned and rolled her head in a shake before regaining her focus on him "Ask away, not as though I can run away from you hm? You will forgive me though if I refuse to answer or…choose not to depending upon the nature of things."
She shifted her head, attempting to lift it but let it fall with a frown, looking at him curiously "Does it really look that bad?"  she couldn't feel anything, while that was great for pain and all it meant she didn't know how much damage she'd done to herself. At least when she got part of her face blown up she had some frame of pain reference to know what she had done. She blew the braid with the yellow feather from her eyes to join the others on the left side of her face.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 16:04:06)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
As Malificere concluded his reminder of where she was, the woman obviously took a moment to reflect. She took a breath with a certain glow about her and offered an apology. "Apologies my liege. I…I….this is just my first time on a ship like this. I got lost in the moment. To be perfectly honest, I got a bit of an adrenaline rush at my first mission. I mean, I never thought I'd make it here! Pursuing such a legendary figure as Skywalker! To be apart of…"
Her green eyes looked upon Malificere's black robes. She had to stop herself again. **"Perhaps I should return to my post?!"** Malificere examined her. A bit of a free spirited one she was. Her attitude was that of a pure spacer, maybe even as far as smuggler. Nevertheless, to get assigned here she must be proficient as a helmsman.
While Malificere might be enjoying a conversation for a change, duty called in the form of com chirp on the briefing table. It was Captain Torvott. **—"Lord Malificere, away team reports secondary main structure is a makeshift living area with bunks and footlockers. They have found personal effects that would estimate about twelve people living there. That coincides with our sensor scan of the outpost for life forms earlier."**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
Their was a solemn air in the cargo hold which had been used for medical treatment for three individuals. As always, the Mon Calamari didn't look amused, yet now he was certainly curious about what the Lieutenant was talking about. **"I'm afraid the injury does look quite severe, however not life threatening. We needn't go into the details as of yet."** The young man spoke as he looked away from the injury.
**"And secrets have a purpose. They aren't just there to frustrate you. If you must know though, if you know too much you present a threat to my unit. Especially since you nearly escaped already and killed one of my Katarns. So why would I divulge mission sensitive information?"**
The Lieutenant's tone grew a bit more serious. He then posed the question. **"What is your job Commodore?"**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 16:17:10)

Daiyu raised a brow at him "is..that a trick question?" She'd worry about the alliance if they didn't know what a Commodore did...or was unmasking something else? "Are you asking what my mission was that brought me to your moon or what I actually do…those are very different questions and I would be concerned of your knowledge of rank and duty if you do not know the basics of what I might do, lieutenant."
She let that brief subtle form of reprimand for his form of questioning before offering "I run my ship, I give orders and answer to those higher than me, I give council to some as well, and when I deem it necessary I assist in things. And for now, let's just throw out rank…I feel rather silly attempting to be Commodore from this position. Call me Daiyu."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 16:21:55)

The Sith held up a hand with an amused smile on his face, for once not thinking about anything except pleasantries as far as an exchange on conversation went. It was rather nice...he had missed just regular conversation and was quite content...until that com chirp. **"There is no need to apologize…Lieutenant Dryhek. This has been very refreshing to me, to have this small chat and to get to know you a little bit better. You have my thanks. As for your post, yes. When you are done though, I was wondering if we may continue this conversation over dinner? I find your excitement and over all personality very refreshing…and I believe I have something that you may like to have. I can't tell you what it is exactly…as it would ruin the surprise. Just know that I will not take any refusal of the gift…It is yours to keep."** He offered her another smile before answering the com message. **"Have them sort through the personal items. When they have gone through everything, we will send a shuttle to retrieve anything that they cannot use or make useful for anything. Also, any actual equipment or electronics that can be repaired, I would like them to make a note of those and relay it back to us."** He looked to Dryhek one last time before standing and looking outside the window. **"It is a large Galaxy, Shanica. I am confident though that you will make your name known in it and be an example to future and current members of our magnificent Empire."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 16:24:11)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
The Lieutenant seemingly grew a bit aggravated. **"Commodore's don't only command ships. They can be instructors, coordinate naval forces away from the front, or be second in command…Perhaps even a tier one administration official."**
He sat back a bit on his cargo crate. **"Don't assume just because I'm apart of a foot mobile unit that I'm incompetent. But thank you for that information, Commodore. But since we're on the subject. What is your ship doing at Ebaq 9?"**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 16:28:57)

She smirked, rather enjoying being a smartass "I advise, to a few but I do, and I'm second to no one. I took my old ship from Sith hands before so I'm not average nor normal…forgive me though, rank doesn't really explain who I am or what I do. As for why we're here? Exploring." She said with a cheeky grin, honestly she'd said it five times that she had to get to Cade first, if he couldn't but it together she wasn't going to draw him a picture.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
The officer listened to the conversation over the com panel. It concerned her somewhat. But she had to keep the *Malevolence* running smoothly. She would be constantly checking thruster vectors and approach angles. As well as monitoring subspace energy bleed. Her mind was always thinking about her job. But that made her happy, and that reflected when she met a Sith. **"Dinner? Will I have time?"**

**"Exploring right? Why are you exploring the Deep Core? Most everything here is mapped in the Imperial databases, or so I'd hope by now. I want specifics on your exploration objective. I'd think that would be left to a science vessel, not something like an Imperious craft. Do you think that would add up?"**
The man remained patient, he suspected the officer was going to be conniving and most likely use her silver tongue. But he knew he was a Katarn, he had ways to get her to speak.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 16:43:40)

Maleficere had a thought in his head. *You'd better make time. A Sith does not extend such invitations at random.* Instead the words that came from his mouth were much different. **"I believe so. I would assume that all crew have time to eat meals…don't they? If you cannot then you cannot, yet it would certainly be a pleasing experience to be able to have dinner in the company of such a vibrant soul…while listening to the music of Squid Lake…?"** Secretly Maleficere adored the arts...specifically opera. It was usually what he listened to before going to sleep at night, whenever he had time that is.

Daiyu sighed and raised a brow at him "look, we both know that if you ask the wrong questions I'll continue to evade and you'll think of torture which we both know will get you no where as I've survived a lot. So, here's what I propose, you ask me the right questions and I'll give you a less than smartass like answer. I've actually given you a lot of information already so prove that the katarns are everything I've heard about and figure it out."
She grins brightly at him "have to say though I am curious where we're going, alliance has always been a fascination, might be nice to see things from the other side."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 16:52:12)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
The woman looked intently. **"Squid Lake, like from Coruscant? Um, that sounds fun."** She seemed to be growing a bit more uncomfortable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
The Lieutenant ran his hand through his hair. It was growing time for a trip to a refresher, but he a vital task to attend to. **"Now you admitted you are evading me. That helps. Thank you. So what questions would you prefer? We have plenty of time after all. But really, if you're just exploring why is your objective so important to keep hidden? That might make me think there is something more important about what you're doing. You could have just said I'm going to this system. You know?"**
He didn't pay attention to her snarky grin and question as to where they were going.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 17:01:51)

Maleficere turned to face the young Lieutenant before offering **"I get the feeling I am making you uncomfortable Lieutenant. That was certainly not my intention. You may return to your post, and I leave the decision up to you as to whether we meet for dinner. If you decide you would rather not, I of course will understand and respect that."** That was certainly true, the last thing he wanted to do was to scare this poor girl into not speaking to him ever again. **"Dismissed."** he added while returning his gaze out the window. By the force he was bad at this sort of thing.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 17:03:12)

Daiyu frowns at him "i may evade but I so not wish to lie. We were here in passing, had we not picked up scans of your place of rest we would have passed through, as it happens..we did." She breathes deeply a moment and looks to the ceiling, "we were searching. Not for alliance outposts, bot even for citizens or ships, we…I was not looking for the Alliance period." She turns back to him "that's why would have let you go. It wasn't you I was looking for, nor do I believe you able to help me."  She nods towards the medic "he made it apparent that it would have been a waste to even follow you."
She shakes her head "doesn't matter now though."

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 17:19:25)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Now Darth Malificere was left to his own devices. The Lieutenant went to the door and offered a consoling smile as she left back to the bridge. She seemed a bit more concerned than she was earlier. The encounter likely was a sobering experience for the Lieutenant. Metaphorically and realistically, she was with the stars...now it seemed she wasn't so much anymore.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
He sat back and offered a genuine smile. **"So, I guess it would not be polite to just ask all the questions. After all, we have a mutual respect for one another. We are enemies, but we respect each other's duty and commitment. Do we not? I wouldn't mind to answer some questions that you have."**
The Mon Calamari didn't seem to like were this was going, but what did he like about the Commodore?

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 17:27:44)

Daiyu smiles this time small and genuine, at least they were getting somewhere now on equal footing "question for a question? Sounds fair." She hums lightly in thought, he wouldn't answer sensitive questions and it seemed they didn't know about Cade so..."what's it like? In the alliance I mean, the Empire paints the whole alliance as…evil, not wanting the best for the galaxy, bleeding hearts that sort of thing…"  She trails of, eyes far away for a moment thinking back to the academy, to master "did you have a choice?" She questions softly. She had wondered, did others come from camps like they had?

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 17:37:25)

Maleficere watched as she left and once he was sure she was out of hearing range he swore under his breath at his miserable excuse of a friendly gesture. He turned to look back out the window at the stars and grand view that it afforded. ***What the hell am I doing? I could have scared her off and shattered her view of everything.*** He sighed before sitting back down and going over how things had been progressing overall. Once he got the Farghul he could hopefully sway her to rescue Daiyu...and if they found Cade....then perhaps both of them could do it, along with Invictus and himself. the four of them would be more than a match...The Farghul alone was an impressive testament to the force....certainly more in tune with it than Krayt. An idea stirred...and he could only grin and give off a dark laugh at the idea forming in his head.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 18:04:02)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
There was a pause in the Lieutenant's speech as he looked amongst the crew, then back to Daiyu. He grew quiet and solemn. **"The Alliance is constantly on the run. We have our ideals of a galaxy that is free from tyranny. But the price we pay is a life of constant fear and migration. I thought your ship was going to obliterate my outpost, you could have easily done so. Always on the move. We're fighting a superior force with 10 to 1 odds. We have to make precise and isolated strikes that can be easily construed as terrorist attacks. We have no choice however, we don't have your resources. But we want the galaxy to remain unified, not conquered. We want peace, but to keep our humanity intact. I imagine you want the same things, but just a different approach. But yes, I joined the Alliance. The Alliance is an entire volunteer force, unlike the Sith Empire."**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Another com panel message emanated from the polished briefing desk. **"—The away team is in the east wing. Again, they've found more storage units that would supply one starfighter for a few months. There isn't as much consumables there. But there is a sealed weapons locker. It's sealed by a ray shield."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 18:09:57)

Daiyu listened, snorting in agreement about the Empire not giving choices, she was living proof. "Someday no one will have to fight, we'll all agree and the galaxy will be better…that a my hope at least. What about Jedi? What are they really like? Did you ever fight under the command of a Skywalker? Did you ever meet Luke? Are they as serene and peaceful in combat as I've read about?"

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 18:15:55)

**"Have them disable the shield and inform us on just what is being held inside. Have those TIE's reached the hanger yet?"** He was getting rather impatient, though it did not show in his voice. He was simply anxious to get out of this area and onto something that could occupy his thoughts more effectively. A good Twi'lek girl could do that, but alas there were none on the ship. He then blinked before sitting down at the table and simply going into a meditative state. This was also effective for him, though he knew it would most likely be interrupted...he really did not mind.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 18:33:30)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
**"Never met any Jedi. Cade Skywalker is not very integral into the Alliance's actions. He is very reclusive. I'm not saying he didn't have a part in our actions. But Luke? Luke Skywalker? He's been dead for over a century."**
The Lieutenant asked Corporal Torvek to check the amount of bacta she was receiving. He confirmed it was a normal amount. Corporal Torvek then asked if Daiyu was feeling alright.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
**—"Yes my lord, the TIE's are all accounted for. As for the weapon's room, it is apparently well-secured. We may need to deploy a specialist to unlock it. If you want the take the time to do so."**
All of a sudden, yet another com frequency called in while the Captain was updating him. It was Commander Ohek. **—"My lord, Darth Krayt demands an update on the mission."—**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 18:37:03)

Maleficere rolled his eyes in annoyance. Of course he did. He exited his meditation and got up to answer the Commander. "Very well commander. I hope that he used a burst transmission to talk to us…Correct? If not…then we will have to abandon this area for now and immediately go to the coordinates I gave the Helmsman." He then told the Captain **"Stand by Captain on that….I will need verification of something first."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 18:39:12)

Daiyu frowned and muttered a soft 'a century?' How could that be? Had Krayt lied? Had her visions lied?? How...what did master do to have her be who she was when he's been gone so long? Her face fell and she turned away from him to stare at the ceiling, she hated feeling like a pawn in her own life, she didn't even know if her history was true now...short of finding Cade she'll never know what's true.
She takes a moment to breathe deeply before questioning "what do you mean? Cade had a hand in your actions."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-17 22:46:01)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
The Commander informed Darth Malificere that the burst transmission was saved for convenience. He patched the message through to Malificere. A holographic image appeared of Lord Krayt standing tall with his arms crossed. **"I've received word from your crew that you've lost a ship and sustained incredible casualties. That you've also had Commodore Daiyu taken prisoner. That is unacceptable. Will I have to make a personal visit to your ship? Or can you find me Skywalker?"**
The message closed out and the comm panel gave Malificere the option to send a burst transmission.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
It was obvious he was starting to get uneasy about revealing such information. **"It's unconfirmed just how much he influences the Alliance's action, even though he is important to us. But you seem to be asking a lot from me without revealing much to us. Why is that?"**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-17 22:53:14)

Daiyu smiled "you haven't asked the right questions. And…well…what information I may have let's me continue to breathe." She sighs and shakes her head "no that's not fair ,there's nothing that says that you would do what we are known to. Sorry."
Another wry grin, apologetic, this wasn't even about holding secrets to prevent krayts wrath but just to ensure her own survival.  "Go on then, ask away. I'll answer what I can."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-17 23:15:36)

After the message was done with, Maleficere pounded his fist into the table in rage. How dare he says what is unacceptable, when he doesn't get his lazy ass off of his throne! He composed himself before feeling the anger course through him. He wanted a reply? He would get one. He started recording, standing tall and proud. **"I had Daiyu do nothing, my Lord. It had already happened by the time I arrived. Unknown to you, my ship was devoured by a black hole after a failed micro-jump, and did all I could to try and prevent them escaping with her. If she is as important to you as you lead others, as well as her, to believe…then may I make the suggestion of you retrieving her yourself? Or perhaps you should have kept her on Coruscant with you. Regardless of THAT setback, if she gets free…which she no doubt will, she will provide us with invaluable information. Base locations, names, possibly even do some damage during her escape. This is not a total loss and I would appreciate if you had faith in her, as well as remember that it was in fact I that got the security codes for Bastion…on my own. I delivered Fel to you, through my own plans. I will bring to your table similar results with Cade Skywalker. All I ask, is for you to remember all I have accomplished when you feel the need to point fingers at someone. It was through my design that he even came to Coruscant. I will be employing a similar tactic with Skywalker, and with all due respect I would hope that you see the wisdom in my words as a servant to the Empire as well as to you. I will NOT fail the Empire."**
He then took a deep breath, and saved it before sending it...hoping that it would reach him once they had left the area. In fact... **"Captain, we move for the Forge immediately. Have the troopers bunker in and await our return to see what they have monitored. That secure locker will just have to wait. I am sending the burst transmission now. let's get moving."** He then sent the burst transmission and sat back...hoping Krayt would either see the truth and wisdom in his words...or that he would have results for Krayt by the time he arrived to chop his head off.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
**"Perhaps you could tell us what you know about the genocide of Dac. Did you have any involvement in it? If so, in what way?"** The shaggy haired young man said as he turned to the Mon Calamari. The Lieutenant felt it would help him get some resolve, so it was a pertinent question. However, it might not be the most mission effective question to ask.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
Darth Malificere had finished recording the spiteful message and hit send. It would likely be a few hours or a day before it reached him. Thankfully, it wasn't HoloNet. At this time he would only think about what would go through Krayt's head. It was true that Malificere had accomplished much since he was in the Empire, but was Krayt really upset about the Commodore? After he addressed the Captain in the peaceful briefing room, a transmission was returned. **"Sir, did you give the coordinates to our helmsmen? The Forge is a rather obscure location. We might need you to input the coordinates personally. The tactical adviser recommends the stormtrooper set up the outpost as a listening and observation post. That will take a shuttle transport to send the appropriate equipment. However, that will delay our travel time to the Forge."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-18 06:36:18)

Daiyu's expression darkened at the mention of the genocide, she still felt strongly about what happened, hated that it had happened at all...no matter what Krayt said, it was unnecessary. All this death was.
"It was unnecessary." she says hatefully, glaring at the ceiling "no matter what he says it was unnecessary, and I'm glad I wasn't part of it." she had been on the outskirts of space, waiting for transports...she still has mixed feelings on that transport that escaped them...then again it might have been for the best if there were delegates on board, people able to continue the history and such...and there wasn't even a good way to fix the mess short of cloning and that could only do so much. "He had told me once, that it was necessary in his mind, that it sent a message to the Alliance. That's what he said, I don't care what message it was, it was foolish and unnecessary and now there isn't a good way to fix it! Extinction is never an answer to anything! All life has the right to breathe and live and choose and think, I don't care if they don't agree with certain thoughts that's their right, their sentient and now…now there's a whole section of galaxy that's just silent and I don't know how to fix it properly.."  she was trailing off and sighed "Cloning two wouldn't fix anything, it would only produce bodies but not the necessary amount of different genetic coding to ensure a re-population…don't even know how many were on that transport or how many managed to stay safe…" she mumbled on, rambling quietly the plans she had been making in her head of what would work to return the species to proper order.

Maleficere had had enough. **"Captain. When I say we need to leave, I mean we need to leave. If you need me to input the coordinates then I can do that. But those troopers are just going to have to wait for us to get back."** He got up and moved briskly to the bridge and personally input the coordinates for the Star Forge. **"May the Force be with us….May it be with us all."** he muttered under his breath. When he was finished he gave a nod. **"Again, let's get going. Immediately."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
As Darth Malificere walked onto the bridge, he moved past the various sophisticated computers and personnel. He walked into the bridge overlook at the end of the walkway. On the overlook, was a singular control panel and railing to prevent from falling. He looked down and saw the helmsmen closest to the navigation systems. He went down to input the coordinates, and he had to cross over Lieutenant Dryhek. She presented a genuine smile as she looked away from the coordinates. Her toothy grin was just... uplifting. What was Shanica doing here? Nevertheless, once the coordinates were input, she began gathering data from the navicomputer. Then the unthinkable happened. Shanica had something to say in front of all the helmsmen.
**"My liege, when was the last time you traveled to that location? From our current location to those coordinates would require incredibly precise calculations. You're not asking me to attempt such a maneuver are you? As the route we're taking would have to been from Ebaq to those coordinates to be a routine check."**
The helmsmen knew what she meant. The Sith had requested of the helm crew a extreme risk hyperjump, but that was Shanica's way of politely correcting his potential navigational error. Had it been that long since the Academy? Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge might be potentially embarrassing in front of the helmsmen. Especially coming from Shanica, but she was bold.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
The Mon Calamari didn't know how to take what he was hearing, but he couldn't take himself from the conversation. He remained quiet. The Lieutenant however, kept up the conversation. **"So you deny any involvement in the Battle of Dac? Is that what you're telling me? Please answer that question. But, I didn't know you had such strong feelings against the Battle of Dac. In fact, your ideals don't seem to match up with the Sith Empire. Are those ideas about the restoration your idea, or the Empire's?"**

### **zerah** (2013-03-18 20:40:07)

"I nor my ship or crew were at the battle, we were stationed away keeping eyes for fleeing ships." She told him. Shaking her head "I am not the usual imperial, I know this my ideals do not match but I know this and do not care, I have a voice and it will be heard if this galaxy is ever going to prosper like we all want." She states passionately "my views are mine. No one dictates my thoughts but me."

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-19 02:33:00)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
**"So you if you were blockading ships then you were apart of the battle. I see. I'd appreciate any further details you could offer on it. But, what do you mean about your voice? The galaxy will hear your voice? Don't you think that is a bit pretentious? Or perhaps ambitious? You are a captive of the Alliance Remnant. What makes you think you'll escape to have your voice heard? What if we decide to keep you for the rest of your days?"**
The Mon Calamari grew even more angrier than before. He knew now that she had a hand in the genocide, if not in a more arbitrary fashion. He might be wondering if she was targeting fleeing refugees, or incoming rescue ships.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-19 06:26:05)

She shot a look at the calamari, "for ancestors sake stop looking at me like that! I had orders to follow, I didn't enjoy it. And of it makes you feel better the only ship that came by escaped, probably for the best." She turns back to the Lieutenant and sighed at him "I've stated views in my own way to others, even if I'm dead my voice will get heard in someway."
She frowns at him she knew they could keeper but she hoped they weren't naive enough to think she won't try to escape again. "There are no other details, I've done things I'm not proud of for the sake of orders not my own choice. If you aren't high enough in the food chain you do as your told and plot for when you're higher. That's what I've learned growing up."

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-19 08:03:36)

Maleficere's played it off with cool and calm tones in his voice. Was he mad? Or was he genuinly calm? **"Then we make for a further away system, and then to those coordinates when it is a distance that will end up being yet another normal jump to light speed. I have had enough of problems happening…What I want are results, clear clean results. Lord Krayt expects nothing less. so let me make this clear in case some of you were not listening or thought you did not hear me correctly. We jump to a system that is further away, then we go to lightspeed and make a routine journey through light speed to the locations I gave for the Forge."** The only reason he had not gone off the deep edge, and was still being polite and trying to be caring right then was because he liked this crew. Hell he was even glad Shanica had corrected him, but he was more mad at himself. A simple thing to be corrected by meditation. After a few deep breaths he looked to the Captain. **"See that it get's done. This time, it does not matter to me how long it takes to get to the first stop. just as long as we are able to make a normal jump from there to the Forge."** Just to be safe, he said in a flat tone **"Oh and I believe it best if the way-point is NOT Coruscant…lest Krayt see us and think we already have something for him. I hope you understand the importance this places on us. But other than that, carry on."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-20 01:08:10)

The bulbous eyes of the Calamari remained locked on the Commodore. Lieutenant Lightvold noticed his angst but didn't ask him to calm down. However, the Lieutenant continued the conversation. "So, you really were conscripted? But if you really disagree with the Empire why do you stay with them? You do have free reign over your thoughts, as you said."
------------
On the bridge of the Malevolence, the helmsmen seem kind of bothered by the apparently angered Sith. Lieutenant Shanica assessed the situation and stood in a rigid parade stance, illustrating complete respect for Malificere. Her shaply figure made her seem even more professional. Shanica took care of herself. "Your highness, on those coordinates I can arrange an alternate route by hyperspace triangulation. Then we can follow the target via sublight engines."
As she addressed Malificere he saw a smile beginning to betray her military demeanor. Had he charmed her?

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-20 06:31:04)

Daiyu blinked at him, her expression truly confused at his words. It might even occur to him that the notion of defecting, anything to leave the Empire had never actually occurs to her as an option. She had considered retiring now that she had a title and even a house but it was still in the Empire, leaving had...it just was never thought of.
She frowns slowly "it's all I know."  she said, voice small even as it was stated as though it meant everything. She'd been born into the Empire as far as she'd ever known. A slave on an imperial planet, trained before being sent to the academy, everything they'd ever done...even now had been planned out by master and moffs. The empire was all she knew.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-20 08:01:25)

Maleficere looked to Shanica with astonishment. He had never even bothered to think of that, yet here this woman was...presenting him with a million credit idea. **"If that can be done, then go ahead and make it happen."** He offered her a smile in return before looking at the view in front of them. Was it the fact he had let her leave when he knew she was uncomfortable? Or was it simply the fact that she was excited about her idea and knew it would work and make him approve. Either way, it WAS a good plan.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-20 16:40:18)

All of the Katarns in the cargo hold were having a hard time not listening to the words of the Commodore. That was the thing about officers, they always got to have the interesting conversations. The enlisted men just had to man their duties and be quiet despite what they were thinking.
Lightvold tried to assess the Commodore's intentions and then responded. "It's an expansive galaxy. There is more to know, if you wish to learn. Think on that."
--------------
Shanica made sure that the helmsmen were doing their hyperspace triangulations. The Lieutenant then let Captain Torvott know the ship was set to Wild Space as a destination.
After that, a few moments passed the Malevolence was in the hyperspace wormhole en route to the Manaan System.
Darth Malificere was in the Captain's quarters. It was in pristine condition thanks to the M1 droids and the documents filed. There were some personal effects from Commodore Daiyu, some holopictures of their days in the Oturis Academy. Malificere was going over the route plan via datapad when there was a chime on his door.
Lieutenant Shanica entered the quarters. Her cover was removed, showing her puffy red hair that accentuated her facial features nicely. Striking. "I believe we had a dinner arrangements my lord. Unless you're too busy?"

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-20 17:36:49)

Maleficere certainly was not expecting this to happen, but he would certainly not complain. An informal talk with an officer rarely happened....mostly because his Officer's were your run-of-the-mill Imperials....But this one stood out different. He looked to her with a smirk before nodding his head. **"True enough, that we did. I was just going over some things."** It felt...wrong for him to be having dinner in Daiyu's quarters...But he would ensure soon that she was back on her ship. He eyed her red hair before motioning for her to take a seat, and called for a service droid. **"I am glad you could make it though. It's nice to actually have time to talk with someone interesting again. Now that I think on this though, maybe you can help me as well, we can get to business later though."** He thought for a moment on where to begin..and found a pretty good starter. **"Do you have any family…Shanica?"**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-20 18:05:45)

A small nod, wistful in expression "half the joy of being put into the academy was the knowledge that would get to explore the stars." Something the lot of them had shared a love of, and a longing, when they were young to seek out someplace better.
She looks back to him again and chuckles "somehow we moved from questions that I might or might now answer" she says softly, gentle and not minding the turn of things "not that I'm complaining." She ends with a grin.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-20 18:57:24)

The Lieutenant made herself comfortable as a TC unit provided an extra chair. She heard the question posed as she wiped away a small smudge print on the pristine black top of the Commander's desk panel. "I do have family. A mother and father...two brothers. They live in Corellia."
It seemed like she was about to say more, but she watching Malificere awkwardly as she was a bit nervous now.
--------
After the Commodore responded to the Lieutenant he shook his head. "A career choice? Yet you had no choice to the Empire? I'm sure your superiors enticed you in many ways."
The Mon Calamari spoke up at the situation. "Lightvold, you know this isn't intelligence we can use from her."
The Lieutenant didn't care at all he wasn't addressed by his rank and responded casually back to the Calamari. "I know what you're thinking and I'm sorry. But trust me on this, ok?"
The two exchanged words like they were the same rank, like there was no military discipline. It was strange to Daiyu to witness.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-20 19:10:38)

Maleficere raised an eyebrow out of curiosity and sat with one leg crossed over another, and leaned back in his chair as he rested a hand under his chin, supported by an armrest, in a pensive state. **"Go on, were you going to say something else? This is an informal meeting…you can say whatever you like, with no consequences for anything. Please, don't be so nervous."** he said with a smile. **"Unless…it is something you would rather not talk about?"**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-20 19:12:43)

She watched them curiously, she had had to fight half the squad on Endor to call her by her name for sake of keeping the officers hidden and here...they did it like was nothing. She rather envied that. She wanted to ask what it was he was fishing for but refrained from asking.
"I was put in the academy, it wasn't offered as a choice of that or something else, the same with seeking command it was simply…expected. I didn't think of all things to question it, master never exactly lied to us, why question." She said simply, facts, they were simple fact. She could look back now and see how much he had planned on them, and never offered anything else and his name made sure no one else offered either.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-20 23:42:35)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
There was a bit of a relaxed atmosphere in the commander's quarters. The faint hum of the holo portraits were heard as there was a silence. The images showed the class of Oturis Academy. Some were the bunk mates; Janelle, Blake, Niles, and Daiyu... Malificere might be thinking how much he had went through. Now he was the lone survivor from the path of his origins. The attractive Lieutenant responded to break up the silence.
**"I had heard, you were quite intimidating to be around. But I was just myself around you, and I have never been under a Sith's command. You don't seem like the stories that I've heard."**
She leaned back in her chair as the TC unit asked Malificere if they required anything else. The well-polished silver droid allowed himself to see his reflection of his dark robed visage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
Lieutenant Lightvold looked about the cargo hold as Corporal Torvek continued to make routine checks on everyone's condition. The medic then began stocking medical inventory, but she knew the medic was listening to the conversation. Were they all qualified to hear an officer speak about her past? The Lieutenant leaned forward and spoke some more, asking more questions. **"You had a standard to fulfill, against your own will? Who is this master you speak of?"**
Again the Calamari was apparently impatient, he just continued to put pressure on his shoulder wound which had been dressed. She could sense things were amiss with him.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-21 06:32:15)

After so many years of being his slave and than pupil, even now thinking about master as anything but the title was..rude..in her mind, like it was still forbidden. She always inwardly winced when Alvarez mentioned him by name.  "He was my master."  She says simply, she couldn't say his name, even if she wanted to; but the tone of the title made it clear she sis not mean the title like Sith ans Jedi do. It was out of respect to the man who had raised her and taught her and thought of her as a daughter in a way.
Her gaze shifted to the calamari, watching his body language before speaking "hey…are you alright? I mean really alright, wound aside and malice towards me." She asked as she would any of her own crew, with respect, gentle and truly caring but that tone all officers had without trying that expected an honest reply. She was genuinely concerned about him.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-21 08:27:40)

Maleficere was lost in thought as he looked to the portraits of the Academy. How much had he sacrificed, willingly and unwillingly...to get where he was? How much had been asked of him and all of those had he overcame? **"Sith are by their very nature, attached to the stigma of being ruthless and unrelenting in combat as well as in their daily lives Shanica. That stigma, along with how I commanded the Vindicator set the reputation you heard about. I wanted to be respected. I did everything in my power to earn that…and the easiest way I found was through fear. But the more people respected me out of fear, the more i became enraged and angered. I knew they were being forced to respect me…that they were not doing it on their own. With this change of crew and ship I can start anew, and allow people such as yourselves to see that I am not all fire and lightning, I can allow you to see who I truly am beneath the stigma of being a Sith."** He looked her in the eyes now and gave a soft smile. **"I am glad, that you were yourself. I would not have it any other way Shanica. You are too…vibrant, to be anything else. Never hide that fire you have…never hide that passion. It is officers like you, that are the future of the Empire."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-21 16:41:58)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
It was as if Shanica couldn't believe her ears. **"You seem…much too human to be a Sith. If that makes sense. Most Sith I've ever heard about are stoic and introverted. Their are stories they will just remain on the bridge, focused on the beyond…and only make commands when critical. Why are you so different? And I'm not different from any other Imperial rest assured."** She said this with her charming smile, trying carefully not to anger the Sith as talking to them alone could be considered dangerous grounds.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
The Lieutenant was going to continue the conversation when the Mon Calamari interrupted. **"I wonder why….you killed Lance Corporal Aeka. And your organization is responsible for mindless tragedies; regardless if you want to be apart of them, you are. You are responsible for this. I keep this as a reminder of why I'm fighting. Look hard at the women and children…keep your gaze locked on their lifeless corpses."**
The Mon Calamari walked over to Daiyu and pulled out a holocam and flipped through a set of pictures to reveal a holographic image.

**"Look what you've done to my people….and think about it…please…if you're sincere."**
Lieutenant Lightvold went to cover the picture and commanded the Calamari. **"Uckba, that is enough!"** The Mon Calamari shook his head and sat back down. **"Is it enough? I just don't know anymore. I question everything now…"**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-21 17:16:55)

Maleficere leaned forward and gave off a short laugh. **"Because those Sith have no memory of who they were before finding the Dark Side. My training…was very much different than yours. The academy training was the same, but before then…before I was able to go, I endured so much in my youth with the Commodore and Lord Invictus and Commander Niles than you could ever imagine. It was more than -I- could imagine at the time. I also suppose that my difference comes from trying to study both the Light Side of the force…as well as the dark. True power can only be obtained from understanding two opposing forces…so that one day the individual can wield both together. Sith like our illustrious Emperor, may he live forever, seem to not understand this….I hope to one day broaden his horizons so that he may gain even more knowledge and extend his reach."** He looked to the droid who had asked if they requested anything else, then looked to Shanica. **"This WAS a dinner invitation after-all…Would you like to go ahead and request what you would like to eat?"** As he waited he looked over her features one more time before simply saying **"Perhaps some wine as well if you would like…? I assure you it will be fine."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-21 17:21:36)

Daiyu listened, patient and didn't twitch a muscle as he came closer, though she was nervous that he might try to knife her....what he took out though was worse than any knife. She hadn't meant to kill anyone this trip to the moon, the woman had been slow, and her aim had been good, they hadn't been using stun blasts at the time either. She wanted to point this all out, wanted to tell the lieutenant that it was okay because she had asked, but she was frozen. Her eyes as widened at the image in front of her, mouth dry and absolute shock washed over her features she started hard at the display ans after a moment her movements might become clear that she was trying to cover her face, to hide the pain that flashes through her eyes.
She couldn't hide while restrained though that didn't stop her hands and body from twitching to. She had never seen the damage from the attack..and now she couldn't unsee it, and the image shared her mind as it drew up Bastion, her body didn't twitch again it simply went the stillness of traumatic memory, watching her friends blow up from her own ships fire, and the bodies...the skeletons of her first home..Her first family..the other slaves that got left behind and forgotten. Ancestors...Her mind recalled images from the past great war, the destruction of Alderaan, the bodies of Ewoks and rebels alike...was she being shown what her beloved empire had become from the other side? Was the Empire really just...death? She couldn't hear them anymore, her gaze far away as those images just kept playing on a loop in her head, silently unaware of the few drops of her sadness and regret drop down her cheeks.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Shanica set back and perked up a little bit at the dinner proposal. She then turned to the TC unit, while adjusting her puffy crimson hair by removing her naval cover. **"Oh, yes TC-7. I will have dewback stew with a side of nubian greens."**  The woman innocently put her finger on her lip and look to the Sith Lord. **"Should I drink? I'm still on duty."**
The protocol droid looked up and addressed Lord Malificere. His tone was very robotic and monotone for a protocol droid, but then again he was a military unit. **"The Lieutenant is correct your highness. Imperial Regulation Code dash 1187 states that no Imperial personnel may consume any alcoholic beverages on duty or within 8 hours of resuming duty. Any violation of this is subject to punishment by Non-Judicial action or nearby highest unit commander. Any violations are my duty to report."**
Shanica now bit her lip, looking at the Sith with a shy grin.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
Lightvold brushed his black hair aside and looked back to Uckba and then back to Commodore Daiyu. **"Do you need a moment? Can we get you something? Yes, war is atrocious. Though he may not seem like it, I don't think Uckba really blames you. We all have committed to war. We all agreed to use weapons against other creatures, regardless of our affiliation. None of us are truly justified, in my opinion. War is never the solution. Some of us just get swept up in the war like a great tide of waves similar to a Kaminoan storm. We commit because we believe in something, and we believe or hope that our commitment is just. But…killing is never the answer. We're no better than you. You just happened to be designated as an enemy. War is eternal."**
Uckba looked to the side and noticed that Daiyu was visibly distressed. He let out a sigh, not knowing now where to direct his anger. His commanding officer had gotten a bit philosophical, but Uckba understood.

### **zerah** (2013-03-21 21:17:16)

Daiyu' s gaze shifted between the two men and the images and the ghosts in her own head, visibly trying to force them back and regain her control, and looking the battle "there's always a better way…" She says softly. How many times had she told her own people that?
"I keep telling them…keep saying it, keep throwing better ideas that don't get heard or…" just humor her, she wonders sometimes if anyone sees the wisdom she knows she's spoken. She wished now that she had gotten the report back from the New Moff about her suggestions, especially about supporting bastion. Her gaze turned to the images before her and the ghosts still blaming her and haunting her "there's a better way."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-21 21:27:23)

Maleficere admired the pluck of this girl but turned to the droid with a smirk of his own. **"If I am correct TC-7…the 'nearby highest unit commander'…would in fact be me. As a Sith, I outrank anyone on this vessel and I say that this is authorized as Miss Dryhek is not on duty during this time, and will be turning in for the night after this dinner arrangement….thereby being in accordance with the no alcohol within eight hours of returning to duty. I will have what she asked for as far as food goes, and you will bring us a bottle of one of the best wine's we have on board."** He turned to the woman with the same smile on his face. **"You of course do not have to drink if you do not wish to. It will merely be here out of…convenience."** He always found that part of the Sith code could be changed to say *Through drinking, my chains are broken.* A bit...unorthodox to be sure, maybe a bit sacrilegious to certain members of the Sith, but the change in the code brought amusement to him and his chains could certainly stand to be broken given the circumstances...perhaps the Lieutenant's chains as well.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-21 23:39:04)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
Lightvold went over to Daiyu and let out a smile. **"What way is that?"** Indeed, the conversation seemed to be getting more philosophical. It was straying away from concrete military facts. It seemed a strange conversation for an Elite Commando to be having with someone of Daiyu's rank.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Shanica's eyes widened and her ivory striking features were a lot to take in as she remained ever so perky. She placed her service cover on the Commander's finely polished desk, next to the holopictures. TC-7 bowed and said he would return with the best wine that was available. Shanica seemed to relax as she unbuttoned the flap of her blouse so the uniform wouldn't press so tightly against her chest. It was typical for all officers to do when it was leisure time.
After minutes of conversation, a purple wine was laid in front of both of them. Two steaming plates of dewback stew and healthy green vegetables were also displayed. The aroma entered the room. The command office had now become much more relaxed. **"Your highness, this is Alderaan's fine velvet wine. It has been saved for over 160 years. It's an extreme delicacy."**

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-22 06:03:38)

Daiyu looked up at him, offering a weak shell of a smile compared to those she had given before but at least it was granting her a few short moments to compose herself "Any. way. is better. Diplomacy, intelligence operations, stealth missions, but…diplomacy is always better. If either side were actually willing to talk and really hear the others out we wouldn't be at war. All this death wouldn't be happening, things could be better the galaxy could actually have the long standing peace we're both trying to give it." She furrows her bow and shakes her head "Why can't they just view things openly?" 
She already knew that Krayt was biased, Alvar too in a way, he wanted his father's Empire back, but Daiyu...she wanted true peace, she didn't care what name it ultimately was called after, she just wanted to make sure that no more children would grow up like they did. IT was...odd though...odd but nice...to have this sort of conversation with someone other than those she grew up with. Or trying to force the meaning into someone elses head.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-22 08:57:55)

Maleficere looked at the wine before giving a nod. **"An excellent choice TC-7…If Miss Dryhek has nothing else that she needs then I believe that we have all that we need for now."** If Shanica did not need anything else he would promptly dismiss the droid. He then looked to her as he let the aroma of food fill the air. **"I'd like to thank you again for joining me for dinner."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-23 00:39:19)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
Lightvold remained mindful of everything Daiyu was saying. Still, he wasn't really gathering intelligence per standard operating procedure. That could make Daiyu wonder. It also had apparently made Uckba wonder as well. The Lieutenant took just a moment to prepare himself and posed a question. **"So, you have feelings against the Empire?"**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
Shanica crossed her legs and waited for the Sith to begin eating. **"Well this is a first. Dinner and conversation with a Sith Lord. This might be one for the history plasts. So then….to history!"**
Dryhek gave a genuine smile and raised her velvet wine for cheers.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-23 08:13:08)

Daiyu stares at him like he grew another head "Of course I do. Don't you have feelings against the Alliance?" she was aware that although this was a strange way to gather intelligence it was still information that shaped a picture of something...and it really should bother her more than it did that she was simply talking as though these people were friends even. Deep down she supposed it was just a nice feeling to talk and not feel judged that at any moment she'd turn traitor or that her words had to be reported to any of the Sith.

Maleficere gave her a nod and a charming smile before raising his glass as well to meet hers. **To History.** After the toast he set his glass down and started to eat slowly, taking a sip of the wine every so often. The food tasted better with company, it always had. In between bites he nodded to the wine **"Exquisite…."** He then eyed her once more with the smallest hint of hesitance, as if not sure it was a good thing to say **"As is the company…"**

Lightvold gave a smile to Daiyu and shook his head. **"I have feelings against war. But the Alliance fights for freedom of tyranny. I suppose if I can prevent incidents like the genocide of Dac, the Jedi Purge, and the bombardment of Bastion…I will commit sin to do so. For the sake of others, I suppose you could say. In a way I guess it's a lesser of two evils. But even Jedi take life when they have too. Though there are some Jedi that would never kill throughout the ages."**
Corporal Torvek checked Daiyu's knee and gave a solemn look at Lightvold. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**"Indeed it is magnificent company. Especially to meet such a unique Sith. But permission to speak freely my lord."**
Lieutenant Dryhek gave off her trademark cheery smile. Sometime you would really believe this woman belonged on a space transport, exploring the galaxy.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-23 21:02:52)

He gave off a nod before setting down his glass and looking to her. **"I believe I have already stated that I do not mind you speaking your mind Miss Dryhek….But yes, you may."** He had to laugh on the inside as he felt that this whole relaxed bit was too good to be true, and were this a holo-vid this would be the point in which the officer would tell him that the food and drink were poisoned...on Krayt's orders.

Daiyu expression darkened "bastion should not have happened as it had. Dad shouldn't have happened at all, and the purge was…" She shook her head, poor choices. She wouldn't things. She would escape here, though it would rather saddening to leave them, and make herself climb higher.
She looked between them, dread creating through "what?…what is it?"

Shanica tried to remain as pleasant as possible. "As I said, you just don't seem like a Sith. Your speech, your mannerisms, and your presence. I mean you just seem like a...scoundrel." That was a common used word used in the galaxy. It typically referred to a suave male who was rather adept at getting his way in an unsavory manner.
-----
The corporal and lieutenant traded glances. The Lieutenant then posed yet another question. "So, what if you were to stand against the Empire? Perhaps I could arrange that, if you wish."
Uckba and Corporal Torvek wondered what the Lieutenant was thinking...but as now they still weren't getting hard intel.

### **zerah** (2013-03-24 08:30:58)

"Defect?" she nearly choked out looking between them all. Defect to a side that stood against everything she'd been born into? raised into? told that she had to fight for because it was their destiny? Retiring was one thing but....leave? just...just leave to fight against them? against Alvar? Invictus? ...Krayt?
She felt something akin to panic well up in her chest, he said it so casually! like she didn't have a master who died to ensure that she got through the academy and had made plans for them! that...that moffs weren't counting on them....were they though? they wanted the destruction of the Alliance as much as Krayt, Alvar wanted to rule the galaxy and to hell with everything else...She wanted peace, true peace, happiness around, comfort for all, that...that didn't matter what side she was on it just mattered to get heard and understood and get them both to listen.
She'd been born to a Jedi and the right hand to the old emperor, her father told her to find the light and master told her she was to help the empire. She was on the line between both, since day one...since the desert when she couldn't leave any of them to die in the heat.
Never really was a good Imperial… her rational mind supplied quietly and you refuse to be trained by Krayt or Alvar…what does that leave? Jedi...she would have had to find Cade and ask him...but he'd likely not if she stood with the Empire...
But the Empire wasn't bad! not...not fully...they had good points, good meaning that just got lost along the way...
She sighed and looked away from them, looking to her knee, her argument sounded weak even in her own head. "How bad is it…" she asks softly instead, turning her gaze to the medic "Just tell me...I need to know." I need to know my options.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-24 09:19:01)

Maleficere blinked in surprise for a good few minutes. Perhaps he had not heard her right...? No no, there it was...She had said scoundrel. His father was certainly no scoundrel, how in the galaxy had he been slapped with that title?? He gathered his thoughts for a moment before figuring out a way he could roll with this. **"Since we are having an informal discussion…Perhaps you could offer more insight? The idea of course is for me to be a Sith…and follow my Father's example. Surely you know of the Great Emperor Palpatine? Would it be better if I killed any who failed me? I value your insight…and perhaps you could help set me on the right track."** All thoughts of romance were out the window now of course. She had effectively saber-blocked her with words. But at least he could get an idea for how he should proceed in his line of work.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-24 16:41:55)

Shanica tried her best with a comforting smile to soothe the Sith. "Don't get me wrong. You just seem slightly out of place for a Sith. I've never heard of Sith inviting crew members to one-on-one dinners. The way you speak, while eloquent, seems to have a twist of a rugged spacer. But I guess that goes back to what you said as you weren't trained traditionally."
Malificere noticed she was eating at a normal rate. However, she was drinking the velvet wine quite slowly. Perhaps because it was so rare.
----------------
Corporal Torvek raised his datapad and double checked his information. "Commodore, it seems the blaster bolt injury that you sustained has left you with a shattered knee cap. The fact you walked on it was by medical standards, inconceivable."
He then looked to the Lieutenant. "I'm afraid the cybernetics parts we had were left on the outpost. I didn't have time to retrieve them."
The Liuetenant then looked to Daiyu and back to Corporal Torvek. The situation was grim, or it seemed.

### **zerah** (2013-03-24 17:01:16)

She had to laugh, despite everything she had to laugh to keep from despair "that's me for you, abnormal and medical wonder." Sighing she looks between the two again "how long until we reach whatever alliance place we're headed?" Because where else would they be going really.
It seemed though that fate was trying to help she supposed, if..if her injury prevented her com returning to the field then she would have to look into a career change or be forced to retire. Not that she knew what change that could be.

Daiyu heard the two discuss her medical condition. She knew it wasn't good, and Corporal Torvek asking her not to move earlier was also not a good sign. She had moved on it despised her advisement. Also the mention about the lack of cybernetic was potentially nerve racking.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-24 18:35:28)

Maleficere understood what she had meant now and had to give off a soft laugh as he continued to eat. **"In fact…to be honest all I ever have known is the harshness of the Sith code, and the harshness of life. It was engrained in to me growing up and yet…and yet for some reason I am still able to be something of my former self, if only a small part. Regardless of that fact, all of my past has served me well…especially my speechcraft. I gave one of the most rousing speeches in the Academy."**

Daiyu Was torn between making some inhuman growl of frustration at the lack of information and whimpering at the notion that she could very well not be allowed in command if she escaped if she couldn't walk or run.
If...
When did it change in her head from when she escaped to if? She wasn't seriously thinking about not trying was she? Oh ancestors was she entertaining the thought of defecting? What was wrong with her?? She'd never get to see her friends again! Not unless things ended peacefully but she'd still be hunted down! As a traitor even!
But…they did paint the alliance well...No…No, stop..

It would have made father proud..No! We can't even prove ourselves Skywalker!

The Lieutenant just explained it straightforward. **"I mean, you don't like the Empire….do you? Our military forces aren't nearly the strength of the Sith Empire. We could really use you for a great Alliance victory. Or perhaps we could negotiate another deal, if you're interested. We could negotiate, officer to officer."** Suddenly, the aura within the cargo hold and become much more serious. There was certainly to be some trust issues.

### **zerah** (2013-03-24 22:55:41)

Daiyu shifted, then gave a long annoyed look at the straps. It was beyond annoying that she couldn't have this officer to officer talk on the same level. Damn straps.
"What…exactly would be your counter offer?" She couldn't stop the words if she tried; they were slow, hesitant, uncertain. She was curious, she wanted to know in some part what other choices there were to her. So far the Empire offered her command, and other empress through Krayt or possibly empress through alvar though she wasn't sure if they're relationship was stable for long term anymore. She didn't know how the Moff viewed her thoughts, and...they weren't coming for her. So really none of those maybe open anymore.
Was there a harm in asking?

Lieutenant Lightvold nodded and began the negotiations. "If you wish, provide us a high value military target. Give us the intelligence to take down the target with minimal casualties. I'm sure as a Commodore you could provide this. If the target is of sufficient value and the mission is successful, we will release you."
--------------
As Malificere was enjoying himself, he felt a presence in the Force. It was... A friend..someone he knew. But he wasn't attuned enough to figure out why he was detecting this presence at the moment.

---

### **zerah** (2013-03-25 06:33:48)

Daiyu frowned at him "give you a target and you release me to return to those I had betrayed?" she questions, unbelievable. Why would she do such a thing? this was....she blinked slowly and hummed, a thought lighting up in her head. Oh...oh that would be good. Where could she send them though? Bastian would have been ideal for an attack...but they'd already done that.
hm...she could send them after a star forge...it would destroy them at the same time but...she didn't want to continue this damn war.
Time...she needed some time, and...oh....oh she could do that.
"I have a counter." she said slowly "Take me to Cade. And I will give you information that only I have on a high profile target."

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-25 10:24:53)

Maleficere blinked at the feeling before looking up to Shanica with a smirk **"Thrust to weight ratios, eh?"** He cringed inwardly at the pun, but it had just sort of slipped out. He then cleared his throat, took one more sip of wine, before putting on one of his more favorite choral arrangements that he had come across. Listening to this particular thing always helped him concentrate, and before he actually played it he said **"If youw ill excuse me for just a couple minutes…I felt a presence in the force. It…intrigued me, so I will be meditating for just a few moments. You may watch if you like…I am sure you must be interested to see or maybe, if you can, feel the presence of the energy of the force…"** He then focused on that presence as the choral arrangement played softly. the dark tones helping to soothe his mind as he tried to figure out who it belonged to.

**"It might be difficult to arrange a meeting with Skywalker. What HVT are you talking about? It sounds quite intriguing. We are more than happy to negotiate with you."** The Lieutenant said with a smile. Maybe he was really offering Commodore Daiyu an alternate path in her life?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
Shanica heard the mention of thrust to weight ratio and didn't catch on to his insinuation. "Yes to space faring or atmospheric craft; the instantaneous thrust-to-weight ratio of a vehicle varies continually during operation due to progressive consumption of fuel or propellant, and in some cases due to a gravity gradient. The thrust-to-weight ratio based on initial thrust and weight is often published and used as a figure of merit for quantitative comparison of the initial performance of vehicles."
She then stopped in her explanation and curiously put her finger on her lip. "Oh yes my liege, you may commence your meditations. Is everything alright?"

Daiyu eye him, trying to see if he was really willing. But was he high enough? She wouldn't risk everything unless she got to Cade. "This is an end all…I will keep quiet unless a better deal comes up if I don't get to Cade. But…you secure this, and I'll give over everything I know about Krayt himself." She vows. "With some conditions of course, I don't more lives lost that don't have to."

Maleficere continued to delve into the force, searching...whatever it had been...it was familiar? Friendly...granted that could only be a few individuals he had met, but maybe it was someone he had NOT met yet? Who was it?? He spoke softly with closed eyes to Shanica **"I believe so….Just….a familiar energy in the force. I am trying to discern who it is…and what the nature of it is as well…It may prove to be difficult though, but no worries."**

**"I can offer no guarantee on meeting Cade. But what can you give us on Darth Krayt?" And what are these conditions?"**
The crew seemed intrigued. These Katarns could be responsible for playing a major factor in this war. This was what it meant to be SpecForces...conducting critical operations that end wars. Executing missions that no one could know about.

Darth Malificere focused on the Force and stretched out with the Dark Side. A friend, a distant friend. This person was in pain. But who was it? He felt great pain as his eyes were shut. But the pain wasn't anything like the Vong shaping he experienced. It was hard for him to relate. His attunement to the Force was failing him, and he knew it.

### **zerah** (2013-03-25 17:31:52)

"Weakness…thoughts, a look into the man that..that's inside the ruthless Sith Lord." She sighed "any action taken would need to be careful. I will not have a hand in any more than information. My conditions are simple. Civilians stay as safe as possible as so the two that have been family since I can remember. Simple. But you will hear nothing until after I am in Cade's presence." She looks to them all "I suggest figuring out how to comply."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-25 17:49:15)

Maleficere hated this. Why was he failing? Was he not strong in the force? Was he not Palpatine's heir?? Perchance it was the atmosphere clouding him. His brow furrowed as he tried harder and harder to figure out just who this was. Whoever it was, he knew them. **"This…is troubling Shanica. Someone I know…Is in pain, a distant friend. If I could just…."** He was not sure what to do at this point, but he knew he would hold ont it as long as possible to try and glean what he could.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-25 23:10:54)

The young officer shook his head and replied. "We'll need the intelligence and a successful mission first, then you can see Cade. I'd hate to put it like this, but you're in no position to be demanding."
------------
Shanica stood up and came to Malificere's side. "Is it...someone from the Vindicator? A survivor?" Perhaps Malificere was pulled from his meditation. But the ivory features and green eyes of the beautiful officer was now fully in his visage. She was fairly close.

### **zerah** (2013-03-26 06:25:53)

Daiyu shakes her head slowly "But I am." she says and then gently explains "any information I give you, especially on him will come back to me if I'm free, it will mark me as a traitor. If I choose to defect and then give it away I will still be a traitor. If I do nothing at all and stay silent then I will be here or in a cell for the rest of my days if I choose not to attempt an escape, more than likely no one else will come for me it's just not how they do things." she says, smiling very gently while she explains that in this one situation she has more power lying injured than ever before "I can take torture. I can take guilt and remorse, I'm fairly certain I can take never seeing my only friends and family again. But if you or your superiors want a damn thing from me you will make sure that I see Cade first. and I mean within touching distance and able to have a conversation."
She stated her words strongly, primly, last time she had spoken her information she had felt terrible the entire time. She wasn't going to go through that if she could help it. And if it meant being a traitor in exchange for meeting Cade than so be it. At least Alvar would appreciate that she got something from the deal "Those are my terms Lieutenant. No more, no less."  It wasn't like she was asking for sanctuary or forgiveness, if Cade was a living relative that could teach her...she had a right to meet her brother.

Maleficere tried to concentrate harder but it just wasn't working. He opened his eyes to see her much closer than before. He gave off a sigh and leaned back into the chair he was sitting in before saying **"I don't know Shanica…but they were in so much pain. It…was a different pain though. Not what I am used to, but…pain nonetheless…"** He leaned forward a bit and put his head in his hands before looking to the side and giving her a smile. **"It's gone now though."** He reached into his robes and pulled a crystal from the caves that him and Daiyu had visited so long ago...when...when Janelle had...No. He didn't want to remember that. Too much pain and anguish back there. Too late. **"I wanted you to have this Shanica. You will not be able to use it, but you love the universe so much that I believe you would appreciate it anyways."**

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
The negotiations had taken a turn from pleasantries to business quickly it seemed. **"I suppose I could attempt to arrange a meeting between you and Skywalker. However, I'm only a platoon commander in the Katarns. You'll understand if I have to request higher authorization…right? As I'm only platoon commander, I cannot authorize this without checking in with my commanding officer. I'll need your full name, identity number, and rank voiceprinted on a datapad to show that you are the one making the request. After the request is authorized, you will see Cade."**
Commodore Daiyu recognized the fact she had to give her name, rank, and identity number. It was standard operating procedure if you were a military prisoner that you were required to give that much at least. Strangely enough, she had spoken with enough verve to convince the Lieutenant to arrange the meeting however, and she had not really given them any real leads. However, the fact she knew Krayt might be evidence enough to get what she wanted. Corporal Torvek came forward and held out a datapad, he awaited a gesture to begin recording the information.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Shanica looked at the Cyan crystal glowing in her hands. She smiled and looked up toward Malificere. **"It's too precious of a gift. I can't accept this. It wouldn't be right. Why are you being so kind to me?"** She looked up with a solemn smile as she held the magnificent crystal.

### **zerah** (2013-03-26 20:15:48)

Briefly Daiyu felt a twinge of trepidation, she knew everyone else had full names; first, middle, last names...but she had the others they didn't know their family names. Sighing she nodded her head that she was ready "Daiyu, Commodore, id 652" She pitched her voice an octave lower and spoke slowly and softly. She didn't want them able to use her voice for anything important.
She looked to them, nodding that she was finished and wondered if they would bring up the lack of a full name.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-26 20:34:20)

Maleficere almost felt the need to face-palm. By the force this woman was a ditz. **"It is not too precious of a gift…I have a few more where that came from. I got it from a cave full of them. Granted yes it was hell to get to them…"** He gave her another smile before saying **"As for being this nice, consider it simply as a Sith who still knows the value of a beautiful woman's smile…"**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-26 20:36:29)

The Lieutenant shook his head. "Is that your full name? Please state your entire information and at a normal comlink tone where you can be heard."

### **zerah** (2013-03-26 20:41:03)

Daiyu gave him a long look before repeating herself normally. Once she finished she looked back at him tensed "that's all my name has ever been. And the sooner I talk to Cade the sooner I figure out if we really do share a name."  Her gaze dares him to argue the possibility.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-26 23:18:36)

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The *Malevolence*</span>**
Shanica seemed to be a bit taken aback by Malificere's reaction. **"So it was hard to come by? And what's with the flattery my lord? I believe I am undeserving of such praise."**
It seemed that this woman was a bit reserved, or being elusive. What was with her? Was her personality just extremely broad? Or was she just the type who didn't know what she wanted. She placed her wine cup down, seemingly done with it for the time being.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Unknown Space Transport</span>**
Corporal Torvek confirmed that the voiceprint ID was recorded and played it back. Daiyu heard her own voice and noticed it was clear. Now it was most likely solidified in her mind, if it hadn't already. The Katarns had solid evidence of an Imperial flag officer on an Alliance Outpost. But what could they do with it? It was anyone's guess. But now they could use it however they saw fit.
The Lieutenant nodded and announced. **"Good, it has been my pleasure to negotiate with you. Even though you do seem a bit angry and reserved than earlier. Care to tell me why?"**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-27 08:46:45)

Maleficere nodded to the first question. **"It was hard to come by yes. As for the flattery…? Is it flattery if what I say is true? As for you deserving such praise perhaps I should try to be more direct here…"** He took a deep breath. By the Stars this was not going to be easy. He was never good with the direct approach when it came to romance. **"I…believe you to be attractive, personality-wise as well as looks. Do…you understand what I am saying?"** Worst case scenario would be that she slap him if the realization dawned on her that he was asking for something physical, but best case...well, hopefully she would understand.

Shanica's striking features on her face shifted to an uncomfortable position. **"My lord, perhaps I don't understand what you are saying. Perhaps it is also time for me to return to my duties as the food was quite delicious and I'm not intoxicated."**
She folded her hands upon one another in a military posture as she stood. Her body rigid and tense in the impressive visage of her naval grey uniform.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-27 16:53:10)

Maleficere nodded and stood as well, his face expressionless though inside he felt like an idiot. **"Of course Lieutenant. It was indeed a wonderful meal. I appreciate your time as well as the value you have as a crew member, your post is surely missing you. You are dismissed."** As she would leave, he would say one last thing. **"Should you wish to…think…on what I mentioned, and this is the last I will speak on this, you need only to ask me."** It could not hurt, he was letting her leave and it was simply a friendly offer for her to think about it on her own terms. He was satisfied with that at least, there had been no pressure that time...and now the ball was in her court. If she never came to him again that was fine....he honestly valued the time they had spent at least and was happy for it.

Daiyu would groan and thrash and make a number of other noises of displeasure if she had the energy and the lack of pride. Instead she settled with "I'm not thrilled with the ideas of what you might do with my voice print."  She stated drly. It's not that she was hostile, more like she was getting tired of things happening around her that she couldn't control.

Shanica paused at the doorway and looked back to him. **"And *what* exactly do you want me to think on? You're not being very clear and I don't know how far I should read between the lines with a Sith Lord and my Commander. "**
She still looked uncomfortable, as if a tractor beam was pulling her into the passageway outside. He remembered that Imperials were well-trained and fraternization is something they tried to avoid. This would be especially the case if Shanica was a professional.

The Lieutenant replied, **"Your voice print will be used as evidence that we have you in custody and most likely be run through intelligence databases to try to gather any background information we can on you. This is to ensure we can continue negotiations."**

Daiyu watched the cleaning with a morbid sort of fascination while she responded with a knowing grin and dry laugh "won't find much that I haven't told you…of what you've asked anyway." She nods though, it did ease her mind a bit...which was frightening how quickly she was coming to trust some things they said..not good.

Maleficere was caught off guard on that one before saying **"I would just merely like you think on wehther or not you would like to keep that crystal. You had said that you could not accept such a gift, I ask that you take it with you and think on it. If in the end you still do not wish to keep it, then you may return it."** Smooth one Alvar, nice recovery.

Lightvold ran his hands across his face, noticing that their prisoner was being increasingly elusive. **"So then, what haven't you told us that we might be interested in?"**

Shanica's smile disappeared and she approached the Commander's desk. She placed the crystal upon the desk, leaving it for him. **"We should reach the Manaan system in two days and four hours my liege."** She then exited the door, leaving Malificere alone to hear the quiet hum of his orchestral vox.

### **zerah** (2013-03-27 20:03:06)

She raised a brow at him "I didn't say anything but anything being interesting. Just that you'll likely find things I didn't mention because you didn't think to ask. For example, lieutenant, do you have a clean and perfect service record? Do you have any special titles not reported in? Do you have any special status titles not reported? Are you held in high regard with your superiors? Would you knowingly put yourself in harms way to protect those that had not been under your command long and likely would not return for you?"
She shifted her head and watched more closely "do you feel compassion for the lives taken under your command and your weapon? Have you ever argued with authority for what you know to be right? Have you become attuned with a culture from living as them even for a short time? Do you have a reputation in the alliance lieutenant? So you regret your mistakes or embrace them and laugh?"
She wasn't an interrogator but she knew people, knew how to read them and how answers too personal spoke of a person's character and beliefs.

Maleficere had not even realized she had been smiling until it went away. He then watched her leave before closing his door and immediately pour himself another glass of wine and start to drink it as he thought for a moment. How the hell had that happened? That should not have gone that way, not at all. Yes Imperials were trained to not fraternize but she had been off the records and told him he was a scoundrel and not a Sith. If anything that in itself was fraternization...and flirting! He gave off a sigh and continued to listen to the music...Two days and four hours...? Could be worse. So long as Krayt was not at the Forge, he could get back on track with finding Skywalker...and Daiyu. Wherever Cade was, she would definitely reach him before they would. So he sat there, drinking. Where the hell was his father now? Where the hell was anyone when he needed them. Daiyu was captured, the Lt was scared of her own shadow, his father was locked in a damn holocron that Krayt had...was NO ONE there for him now? Where was Ristrin even?? This made him somewhat angry as he continued to drink and ponder, half meditating and half ranting in his head with various angry thoughts...Killing the crew out of anger, strangling Krayt with his bare hands...Hell he even remembered his first kill. He remembered using that stick to beat that boy from Yinchor into submission and death with that final blow. All it did was make him laugh.

The Lieutenant grimaced at the retort from Commodore Daiyu. **"Excuse me Commodore, but don't be coy with me. I'm not interested in your personal service record. I'm talking about your fleet's location or shipyard locations….troop movements…weapons development….special military projects…anything that we could use to win battles against the Sith Empire. I think you knew very well what I meant, did you not? You knew I meant mission intelligence, didn't you?" And from where I'm sitting; it still looks like you still have a soft spot for the Empire somewhere in there, don't you?"**
Uckba was once again getting impatient. Corporal Torvek began to become increasing concerned with the knee problems. **"Sir….I'll need a moment about her condition. It's urgent."**
The Lieutenant held up his hand, he was far more concerned with intelligence now at the moment. **"So is this intelligence…remember she killed Aeka."**
Corporal Torvek tried to object but was silenced by Uckba, the Mon Calamari who remained ever spiteful to Daiyu's cause.

As Malificere finished his glass of wine he continued his half-meditation. He looked out toward the viewport toward the hyperspace wormhole. It was known to cause hyperspace vertigo if looked at for too long, but it was a favored past time of Darth Vader he had read in his history books. A strange quirk. Why not indulge in it now? As he looked at the rapid motion of the wormhole he saw his own reflection....then it became distorted. He saw the pale visage of Lord Palpatine looking right back at him. His eyes red and yellow, his skin pale and wrinkled....it was almost in a rotting state. What was happening to Malificere? He had focused on those important to his life; now it was as if he was staring his father in the eyes.

Daiyu simply blinked, a lazy sort of grin..or tired, how long had she been working on adrenaline and bacta? "Of course I do. I told you, the Empire is all I've ever known. Unlike other Imperials however I see the faults, and I see the benefits of the alliance and their faults, and I see what the galaxy would be if both simply merged."  She turns to the medic "everyone shows who they are when something is on the line. Choosing one makes one better choosing another…you see how close to what you hate you really are." She looks at them all and lands back on the medic and smiles "you choose differently. We have that in common I think. Sorry that I had ignored your advice by the way, can't blame me though, can you? Is it getting worse?"

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-27 21:19:04)

Maleficere blinked for a moment and looked out of one eye with the other closed, then switched, then both again. Nope, that was certainly his father. Should he find solace in booze now? He placed the glass down and held his head low. **"I feel as if I am failing you father… What kind of peace has any of my actions brought to the galaxy? What hope do the Sith have if I cannot live up to you…?"** He looked up and looked into those eyes and face again. **"I am no closer to finding Skywalker than I was at the start, your holocron is in Krayt's hands…True Bastion was destroyed but Krayt is still a large problem. I cannot face him alone father…What should I do…Should we go to Korriban for some long lost ancient artifact…? Should I have the Forges construct the Death Star under Krayt's nose? That was my original plan and still is…But what in the name of the force can I do other than make plans that fail in flames and anguish…I would die for the true Empire if need be but If that is my path I need to know to what end would it benefit the Sith…OUR Sith…Has all my life been for nothing this far….? I have seen nothing that has shown me that I am on the right path and earlier even my attunement to the force failed me. Help me Father, or the true way of the Sith and our Empire will be lost to the ages."**

Corporal Torvek dropped the charade; for him now, his duties as a medic came first. He looked at Commodore Daiyu and tried to give a comforting smile. **"No, I don't blame you….I would of done the same thing against the Sith Empire. But listen to me closely. You have a shattered left knee from the blaster injury. When you walked on it your femur pushed on your femoral artery and caused intense pressure on the vein. It has caused a blood clot. We don't have optimal surgical equipment; I only have first aid surgical equipment. We're going to have to operate now on your leg or the blood clot can possibly be pushed to your lung. Right now you have deep vein thrombosis. If I'm unable to to eliminate the clot, it will go to your lungs and cause pulmonary embolism. That will kill you."**
The Lieutenant sat back in his chair. He now had a difficult decision to make, but he paused momentarily for the Commodore's reaction.

Daiyu grinned weakly "not the first time I did something stupid and had to say hello to the chance of meeting the ancestors."  She was trying to be lighthearted, not for her own benefit, no never for herself.  "Maybe I'll get to see my dad again, seems I only see him when the situation is grave." She swallowed and nodded towards the lieutenant "you have already hands don't you? He has my saber I'm sure, it would cauterize the work if it helps..it's not a small thing but if it'll help you…" She didn't just mean in this, if she died there the odds of the saber getting back to Alvar were slim, it would be better if it went to someone that would use it for good.
She tensed her hands firmly pressing her nails to her plams to shut down the emotions that wanted to show. Be brave, he was worried, he shouldn't have to worry.

Malificere dumped his entire feelings to the reflection of the viewport. The reflection of Palpatine simply let out a yellow/brown smile back at Malificere. He heard something as if it was being directly whispered behind him, was someone behind him?! Shanica? He had to turn around!

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Unknown Space Transport**</span>
Corporal Torvek began unpacking his medical container near Daiyu's bunk. **"Sir, I'll need you to assist. I need the med scanner over her leg. The lightsaber will be an option, but will have to take her off bacta to do so. Otherwise the combination of bacta and the leg's reaction to the severe burns will cause her to go into shock. Also, if we choose to operate on her without bacta the pain of conducting surgery can cause her to go unconscious. That could cause her blood pressure to drop too low because of the bacta and the unconscious state. In other words, operating with the lightsaber could cause shock either way."** 
He looked down at the wound. **"Or I can attempt to stop the blood clot by injecting blood thinner directly into the blood clot. I will have to clamp the artery and simultaneously inject with extreme precision. If I miss, the clot will not be stopped…and the thinned blood will allow the clot to travel quicker to the lungs. All three options are about equally as dangerous. I recommend we go with normal surgery first, and if that fails, use the lightsaber. Of course, I will allow Daiyu to make the decision. I would suggest we come out of hyperspace to find a better medical facility."**
The Lieutenant paused and looked down to her. **"I know everything is dizzy, but do you understand him? We need you to stay talking…please."** He then looked to Corporal Torvek. **"We're in the Core Regions, Sith territory. It's too risky to come out of hyperspace…not to mention the inherit danger of an abrupt halt out of hyperspace. You have to operate Corporal."**
The bacta effect was soothing. She began to feel almost as if dying didn't matter. There was no pain. But the feeling of euphoria she had now would be taken away if they operated without the bacta. She had to focus and respond in order to save her own life.

Daiyu looked between them both, brow furrowing as she focused, when did they become so fuzzy....heh...even the calamari was fuzzy. No, focus. She shook her head sharply to focus and breathed deep to think a quick moment over the options. She did actually want the bacta off...it was messing with her head and she hated that feeling..normal operation seemed the best option of everything, she could take the pain...she hoped.

The Lieutenant grabbed the medscanner. **"We just have the MDC-119 unit, not nearly as effective as the MDC-148 but it will have to do. Corporal, she looks heavily sedated…is she even capable of making rational decisions?"**
The Corporal then looked to Daiyu, **"What operation do you want? I'm starting now."** He gestured for the Lieutenant to hold the med scanner over a portion of her leg. The Lieutenant looked at the med scanner. **"Ok, got it, the clot is in section F-7."**
Corporal Torvek nodded and responded, **"Keep it there. Daiyu! Stay with us!"**

She a medic but she knew....She was sure she knew more than what pieces were floating around...what was that noise? Oh they were talking, she could barely focus, forcing her head to keep up and continue listening when right at the moment sleep sounded good too. "Best..knowledge.." She manages to get out, there were more words one's that said to choose the best, that she trusted the medics knowledge more than her own in this but just couldn't get the words out.

 Corporal Torvek then looked down and began cutting into Daiyu's knee with a small incision tool. **"Surgery site is sterile, making incision. Keep the MDC-119 up sir."**
Daiyu looked up and felt very woozy. She saw Corporal Torvek digging into her thigh area with a clamp tool and a syringe in his mouth. It contained a luminescent blue liquid inside of it. She saw the sight of her own blood quickly accumulating on Torvek's Katarn armor. The Lieutenant looked at the MDC-119 and held it over while Corporal Torvek worked around it.
**"Sir, I'm cutting through the muscle now. I almost have eyes on the artery."**
A gush of blood splattered on the Lieutenant's face as he wiped it away quickly with his sleeve. The situation now was extremely tense...but Daiyu couldn't feel anything.
**"There it is! I see the artery. Lieutenant, confirm with the MDC-119 that's the clot area."**
The Lieutenant moved the MDC-119 closer to Daiyu's thigh and nodded. "Confirmed, I see the clot!"
Corporal Torvek nodded and asked for information on exactly where to clamp. He looked over at the MDC-119 and then used the clamping tool to grab the clotted artery. **"I got it! It's clamped…..by the Force!"**
As he applied pressure to the artery blood gushed out profusely on the Corporal's chest armor. Daiyu couldn't see her leg but knew it had to have been a putrid sight based on the amount of blood she saw. All she felt was pressure inside of her thigh, no pain....nothing...just the fact they were surgically invasive. "Ok Lieutenant talk me in. Watch the needle…guide me in by centimeters! It has to be one hundred percent precise."
Daiyu watched as the Corporal was sticking a syringe down the wide open surgical area in her thigh. The Lieutenant began talking. **"You're too far right! Guide to the left 2 centimeters!"**
Corporal Torvek began to grow nervous. **"The femoral artery is pulsating! I'm losing the clamp! Uckba help! I'm going to have to inject now. Uckba come over here and hold the clamp!"**
The Mon Calmari came over and became apart of the bloody operation as he grabbed the clamp with his finned hands firmly. **"Ok it's still secured. Lieutenant directions! Now! I'm injecting now!"**
**"The clot is 1.5 centimeters left! Focus!"**
Corporal Torvek judged the measurements and then stuck the syringe deep down into Daiyu's thigh. **"Injecting….ok….finished! Uckba release the clamp and don't drop it! Pull the clamp free of the thigh! Lieutenant?"**
The Lieutenant looked at the MDC-119 and back up to Corporal Torvek who was visibly a nervous wreck, covered in blood.

She furrowed her brow at him, did he have to shout? Why was that bacta so strong

Maleificere stared wide eyed at this phantom of a man and it clicked. The man he had seen standing on the walkway as he fell, he looked completely identical. Which meant...which meant... **"You! You murdered my father…"** He said through seething rage and teeth that came in the form of a whisper. He then readied his hand near his lightsaber but did not activate it yet as he spoke in a calm voice. **"Are you here to help or to honder me in my search for Cade Skywalker…?"**

Daiyu stared at him for a moment before bursting into laughter, tired, unbelieving and just this side of hysterical laughter "Y..your bedside manner is terrible. never..never become a medic." she laughed on, it wasn't meant though not really, more the type of laughter one had when they couldn't believe they were still alive, that they had cheated death; if she were able she'd likely be shaking or have fallen to the floor already.
Still, she had a look of contemplation as the laughter slowed, running sluggishly through the information for something minor, small.

This being had taken his father, before he even got a chance to know him.

The Sith Lord fell to his knees and held his hand up admitting defeat. He then removed his helmet. He saw... Daiyu. The image in front if him disappeared as he saw the cyan crystal pulsating in front of him. An illusion?

The Lieutenant argued Daiyu's point with compassion. "Manners are not what matters right now. You have the chance to aid us in the greater good. Do you want more dead women and children on Dac or Bastion? Remember the Mon Calamari."

Maleficere blinked for a moment before realizing...no. No he would not believe this. No no NO! He clenched the saber hard before powering it off and sheathing it. He knew what had to be done and knew what had to be said. He commed the bridge and cleared his throat before announcing to the bridge. **"Ladies and Gentleman, crew of the Malevolence. I have…terrible news from the Force…Through a vision that was shown to me…I…have come to the realization that the

We resume duties as normal, though the Alliance will dearly pay for this. She was a good and strong woman, she treated you all like family…and was part of the only family that I ever had. We continue on in her name, and for the glory of the Empire. That is all. I will be going to inform Krayt of this tragedy.

Maleficere spoke to Shanica without breaking stride. **"A vision from the Force, Miss Dryhek. Lord Vader appeared to me in the room we had been in, I struck it down and when the face was revealed…it was Daiyu's. seeing as how Vader was admitting defeat, I am taking it to mean that it is a symbol of her life force. It is either that….or something much more sinister. Vader betrayed my father, Palpatine, by murdering him…The other meaning of this vision is that she is about to do the same to me…or to the Empire, metaphorically. Either way, it was not a good omen."**

The two walked into the room next to the HoloNet transceiver pad and continued their conversation. **"I don't know what happened to Commodore Daiyu but she did choose to go to the moon with little support."**
Malificere looked to the HoloNet transceiver and remembered who he would be addressing. It was time to talk to the Emperor. The man who had brought unspeakable pain and anguish into his life and trained him in the ways of the Sith. The level emotion may be high.

He had looked into Shanica's soul at that moment, while also feeling Daiyu's soul, which was about to be extinguished. He then might be realizing how disconnected he had grown due to the Dark Side.

Daiyu regained some sort of consciousness as everything was going black around her. She felt her lungs struggling for air. Was she going to help the Alliance when it was so hard to speak? She couldn't speak at the moment. The fallen Commodore just looked at the young lieutenant, medic, and the Mon Calamari gathering around her. Was this her chance for repentance? Was it in her soul somewhere deep down to aid the Alliance? Did she even know what she really wanted at this point? No matter the circumstance, she couldn't speak. Maybe if she would have said something earlier it could have helped the Alliance but now it was too late.
Corporal Torvek looked at Daiyu, checking her with the MDC-119 med scanner. She only heard bits and pieces of what he was saying.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**"As long as you believed……..that………."**

</details>

The Lieutenant lowered his head at the Corporal's words, yet she couldn't hear them. Then once again the Corporal repeated himself. It became clear to her all of a sudden as she fought to breathe. **<em>&quot;As long as you believed in what you are fighting for, you are ok. I promise you will be ok.&quot;</em>**
Her gazed might be locked to Corporal Torvek as he tried to put fourth a smile. A single tear was coming from the medic's eyes. In those few moments they had spent together, she might felt they had known each other for an eternity. It was all she had now. The medic handed her the holotags she owned. Then, he gave her the lightsaber that she had. Finally, he pulled out a datapad that had belonged to her. He flipped through images of pictures Daiyu had taken through the years... She saw them at the Oturis Academy, their maiden voyage, and then she saw Arden....the munyip from Endor.
She thought of the peaceful moon, the tranquil wildlife, it was a paradise that she could think of right now...and after viewing Arden it all made sense to her. Life, in essence, was perfect despite the chaos and imperfections. It was a paradox. Death, Life, Chaos, and Imperfection all came together to form perfection.
Her vision began to fade black...then a familiar voice was heard. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

"Walk to the light."

</details>

At the end of the cargo hold she saw Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade smiling. They were in luminescent form, but they were starting to materialize to a realistic natural state in her very eyes. Luke and Mara held each other's hands as they came to Daiyu's side and wiped away any tears she might be feeling. Luke's warm hand took Daiyu's and then blackness overcame her vision for an eternity...
Then, in front of the three Katarns, Commodore Daiyu's body began to fade from existence. Her body slipping into nothingness in front of everyone's eyes. The blanket she had on her slowly fell to the bunk. The woman known as Daiyu; the woman with no knowledge of her family or of true love, was now gone. Had she found peace in her final moments?

Maleficere felt everything. This.....this was not right at all. **"I am not alright. I can feel her life fading and i am helpless yet again. We…she was going to marry me…"** He took a moment to steady his thoughts before looking to them stonefaced. **"There is a change of plans. We are not informing Krayt of anything. Tell Niles to meet with us, we will go to the forge together. That is an order.**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-31 06:13:21)

Darth Malificere continued to feel weak and the abnormal twinge of the Yerrik in his body. Something wasn't right. He no longer felt Daiyu's presence. In the Force, he could always sense her whenever he wished, but now there was nothing.
Captain Torvott made a suggestion at the witness of their commander's faltering strength. "Perhaps you need to go to med bay."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-03-31 13:53:12)

Maleficere stood there in silence made uncomfortable by the bug. **"Perhaps you did not here me you two? I gave you a direct order and i will not be ignored. This insubordination is not acceptable. When i tell you something, you are to acknowledge me immediately. As for the med bay, i doubt they can help but i will go anyways. Carry out my orders. Now."** Hebthen started for the med bay.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-03-31 17:32:58)

Captain Torvott and Shanica quickly grew nervous, leaving the Comms room and heading immediately to the bridge. Afterwards, Malificere walked to the med bay painstakingly. The yerrik was affecting him, making him feel nauseous and dizzy. He felt pain in his left arm.
What was going on with him? There was now a burning sensation in his chest and then he fell to one knee. Death was imminent. He looked up to the other naval officers who were gathering around him. For so long he felt powerful, but his strength was burning away as he fought for oxygen.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-01 00:04:48)

He looked to them helplessly. **"help……me!"** what was going on??

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-01 00:11:34)

Malificere had a tough time keeping his balance but the naval personnel moved up to him and got him to his feet. His heart was in pain and he felt he had to escape. Something was very wrong and death was rising from the inside! He knew Daiyu was no longer around.
He had just been with Shanica and Daiyu had perished..and now this.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-01 00:21:58)

Maleficer knew death was at hand. He also knew that Daiyu was an Imperial. Imperials, even himself, were just pawns in the larger scheme. But he was a Palpatine. He would survive...he had to. Things depended on him. Daiu knew the risks, and he knew that. He could overcome this. He had to. Daiyu was dead...he accepted this. But now he devoted his hate on Krayt. It would sustain him forever...even in death if it came to it.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-01 00:29:38)

Darth Malificere was carried to the med bay and was admitted to care from the doctors. He had never seen the unit work so hard to give him care.
Medical officer Terrdine did some tests with the MedScan 148. All reports came back normal. He was certain he was near death, but all the doctors and M1B droids assured him he was ok. Were they lying to him? Did the crew have something against the Sith? Some plot of Krayt's design?
Nevertheless, he sat there trembling in the med bed, feeling worse pain than the Vong shaping. All his memories flashing before his eyes.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-01 09:06:06)

Maleficere had to wonder why they were working so hard when they were assuring him he was going to be alright. Everything was most certainly NOT alright, he was in so much pain that he was sure he was broken almost. He would scream his heart out in rage from the pain through clenched teeth so as to try his best to let them do their job. He managed to say through the pain **"Don't…..lie…..to me. Tell me…..exactly…..what is wrong. If you….honestly cant find…..anyth-anything….Check…the damn….bug. If it is….dying…..then so….am I."** he honestly had no clue what it was that was wrong, but that was certainly high up on the list of things that should never be allowed to go south from what he had gathered over the years. Would they understand...? Could they even see it twitching...then the memories came. The camp where he grew up...Ristrin letting him examine and hold the saber-staff...Losing that person to the spikes and that Vader statue, Janelle....All of Janelle....the good, and the bad....same with Daiyu. If she was truly a Skywalker, then she would be one with the force after her death. That made him give off a faint laugh in his head. Always one step ahead of him, she had unmasked what it was like to die before him....That last great adventure. It brought things into sharp releif...Dying, was it even an end? To become one with the Force.....could he add his will to it? So many things he would have to try if this ended badly. Another laugh in his head happened as he realized he would become more powerful than Krayt, it seemed, in a totally unexpected way....and he was okay with whatever this phantom disease brought to him. He would face it with open arms and embrace the pain...It let him know that he was strong to have lasted this far. It let him know that he was still living and breathing. He looked to the ones around him as he embraced the true philosophy of the Dark Side, no longer the happy go lucky man that could make sex jokes or crude comments. No more. He opened his mouth to speak and said to all surrounding him whether they wanted to listen or not **Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Through passion, I gain strength. Through strength, I gain power. Through power, I gain victory. Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me. "** He was speaking in the Sith language...

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**137.5 ABY**</span>
Darth Malificere felt himself regaining a slight hint of strength at reciting the Sith Code. The ritualistic nature of him speaking the Sith Code seemed to inspire the the Imperials around them, as they had never heard something so sacred announced by the Sith before in their lives. It was as if he was Alvar again, pronouncing a speech...only know he was speaking solely for the Dark Side. However, the medical crew was certainly interested by the Dark Side rhetoric and philosophies.
Alvar, if that name still had any meaning for him, had always had a way with words. He could always make those under him think and feel on his thought pattern. Even in one of his weakest states, they seemed to be in awe. It had been the singular most disastrous day in the operation to find Skywalker and he wasn't even sure what time it was. In a matter of a few hours the fleet had lost one capital ship, tens of thousands of personnel, and one of their flag level officers due to seeking out one man. Malificere knew he had asked his crewmen to execute a dangerous maneuver, and they failed him. Then, Commodore Daiyu led an away team to Ebaq 9 for a lead on Skywalker, and a vicious ground skirmish occurred. He had much to worry about, but wasn't sure if he was even going to survive as the Yerrik Bug nagged at his motor functions.
The Yerrik Bug planted by Krayt, there was no telling what it could do to him. But he had to find some degree of focus. The medical technicians had estimated the Yerrik Bug was triggering a fight or flight response in him, and he was suffering from his blood thinning out from the adrenaline rush. He didn't believe them, he still felt death impending.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Four Days Later**</span>
The ship had arrived in the Manaan system and had traveled in subspace. They had locked onto the unique energy signatures that only Malificere knew about the Star Forge and were tracking it. Six hours later, they had extreme range visual confirmation of what appeared to be a space station. Malificere sat in his command chair; having felt much better, but was still fearing for his life every day and night since the Yerrik Bug incident. He looked into the viewport as he saw a small metallic structure glinting in the distance. He went to check with the system operator lead officer; Lieutenant Faayen. She and Malificere confirmed it was at a extreme high probability that it was the Star Forge. However, due to its intense unpredictable nature...there was no way to be positive. They were at extreme range and should be safe.
As the crew began making approach vector arrangements for about thirty minutes, the *Frontier* exited hyperspace at short range on the port side of the *Malevolence.*
![Star_Galleon_SotG%282007%29.jpg](http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/6/65/Star_Galleon_SotG%282007%29.jpg)
Malificere recognized the crew's performance. They had guided a frigate out of hyperspace at optimal formation range to the *Malevolence.* Because of the skilled hyperspace maneuver; the *Frontier* didn't risk being spotted by anyone, nor did they risk crashing into the *Malevolence* by an extremely safe margin. Furthermore, if their Cronau radiation did get them spotted, they would immediately be in cover position of the *Malevolence.* Lieutenant Shanica Dryhek was certainly impressed. Commander Niles' crew led a good crew and was performing at expert Naval operations level. He might be wondering if his skills as a Naval officer were perishing. Niles had come a long way since the days of the Oturis Academy.
A transmission was relayed from the Comms center. **—"Commander Niles, reporting as ordered."—**
So much had happened; the hyperspace mishap, Daiyu's death, Krayt's Yerrik Bug, and now it was time to push on to Skywalker. Perhaps Malificere's agenda was to find more answers, or to simply only accomplish the mission at hand.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-01 18:04:02)

Maleficere looked out of the viewport and looked with narrowed eyes. When would the next spasm hit? Would that one be the big one that ended him? ??He knew he could not worry about that all the time but it was rather hard in practice. At the arrival of Niles he looked to the Captain and relayed that Niles was to wait until further orders, which would be fairly soon. Thought for a moment before asking **"Is there a way to establish communication with the Forge….without giving away our position? If what I seek is on board, then perhaps we can circumvent the whole naval battle."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-01 18:12:58)

Captain Torvott walked over to Darth Malificere who was with the sensor operator. "My lord, we could try a probe droid and leave it with a singular message. It typically responds to what it finds, but it is possible to send it forward as a messenger device."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-01 20:27:36)

Maleficere nodded and looked to the Captain. **"As good an option as any. No fighters would deploy, because there are none there Captain….It is mostly self sustained and operated. Not so much an AI…but it was made by the Rakatan so there is no telling how it runs. I myself believe it to be the Force."** He waited for a moment before turning to the Captain. **"Ah yes, the message. The message will state that 'I am requesting to come aboard safely, and discuss a possible trade of information that can benefit everyone.' If the droid gets destroyed…then we will have to do things the hard way."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-02 01:58:43)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The *Malevolence***</span>
Malificere looked out at the viewport towards the glimmering object in the distance. The *Frontier* was on standby in right echelon formation to cover the aft and starboard side of Malificere's ship. Again, Malificere might reflect on his command ability being better than his. No matter at the moment. Answers were needed at the present time; so what did the Star Forge behold?
Captain Torvott summoned Lieutenant Leevold. The young man was in charge of the probe units and visual scanner surveillance on the *Malevolence.* The two stood over one of the consoles about ten feet to the left of Darth Malificere. **"Probe Unit approach vector and thrust calculations set. Message programmed. Launching single probe unit."**
A faint thump could be heard on the port side of the ship. After a few seconds, Malficere saw the white ball of the probe unit being fired towards the Star Forge. It would take some time before it reached the Star Forge at its speed.
During the wait, Commander Niles hailed Darth Malificere requesting HoloNet transmission for the *Vindicator's* battle damage assessment and the results of the recovery operation.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-02 14:41:33)

Maleficere had no time for thoughts of who was a better commander. Strokes of luck were nothing but that. He had the holo-net opened and cleared his throat. **"Glad to see you still with us Niles. I certainly hope that SOME survivors were rescued? Or has my entire crew of the Vindicator been lost? Either way, it pleases me to see you well."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-03 22:17:49)

The red eyes of Commander Niles still had a distinct glow to them as he was in HoloNet form. His uniform clean and pressed well, his rank placed precisely on his chest proudly. He began speaking with a solemn look. **"I saved as many as I could. 41 survivors out of 40,352. The survivors were thirteen TIE pilots, 7 crew from two lambda shuttles. The other twenty one were escape pod survivors. Out of the 41, only 8 sustained minor injuries. So thirteen TIE starfighters and two Lambda shuttles were also scavenged. It was….the black hole…it's pull was too great and any craft leaving were lucky to evade it's wake. We estimate the Star Destroyer imploded in the center of the black hole…destroying everyone on board. That concludes my report. If you wish the survivors to come to you I can arrange that. Some of your bridge crew managed to escape."**
The chiss stood in parade stance, arms neatly folded...and it looked as if he had something else to say.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-03 22:38:39)

Maleficere breathed a sigh of somewhat relief before making a note in his head for something. Some survivors were better than none after all. He noted though that the Commander looked to have more to say, and he raised an eyebrow and motioned to him. **"If you have something else to say Commander Niles, then go ahead. It does you no good to try and reserve yourself if you wear yourself so openly on your uniform…Please, continue."** It was said in a polite tone, but this was starting to annoy him that people thought they could hide things from him.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-03 22:54:47)

Commander Niles shifted his stance and puffed his chest out. **"Permission to speak freely?"**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-04 07:53:35)

Maelficere knew that this would be interesting, but he had a way around things this time. **"Commander Niles. We are allies and friends are we not? When have I ever told anyone to NOT speak their minds? Though I certainly applaud your naval respect, and the respect of authority. You may say whatever you have in your mind."** In his head he was thinking *Go ahead. Make my day.*

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-04 22:51:21)

The Chiss seemed unamused and spoke as a friend. **"Do you remember the year 128 ABY? The day we were in front of Admiral Nabross and her staff? We had to test our spoken abilities. On that day, I realized you were different than the rest of us. It was difficult for me to swallow. You became the envy of many in our class. I mean, you were given command over myself and it's something that didn't sit well with me. Master Ristrin trained us in the Yinchorri camp to cultivate us for something special, and you always seemed to be the best out of the group. And I heard the uncanny tale; about you receiving the Sword of Destiny."**
The chiss pulled down on his blouse to press out any creases and continued speaking as the HoloNet feed phased out momentarily.
**"It was as if; all the hours of philosophy we spent in tutelage under our Master, that you were the embodiment of all his hopes and ideals that he taught. When I was growing up in the camp I didn't believe in fate and it was hard to wrap my mind around the Force. But you survived The Temple of Atum Per Dietas. I was not selected at my experience level to even try out for the trials. Master Ristrin told me personally after you succeeded that just because you possessed the Sword, that you are not Chosen. He said we were all Disciples of Palpatine. As you know, he was cryptic as always. He said I still could live up to Palpatine's legacy. Our Master always wanted us to prove ourselves over one another in the family. Like you, I've carried that training with me all the days up to my Naval career, and right until now. You realize, with Tenmel and Issa dead by your hands…all the others that have died from Yinchorr….we are the only two remaining. We are the last two to fulfill that Legacy. It's as if the Force has chosen you. Haven't you believed this your whole life? You were selected by the Force for something greater… and you always survived…you will continue to survive. Most likely, I'm the next to die. Don't you know that you are chosen? Answer me please."** 
The chiss had obviously been putting deep thought into their origins as of late and their "special" treatment as trained Imperials. He looked concerned, yet content for things to come.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-05 08:13:35)

Maleficere had been expecting some hate filled speech yet here this man was...speaking like a true friend as well as an experienced Naval Officer...like Maleficere would. He took a deep breath to think for a moment on those days before saying, getting up from his inherited chair. **"I remember those days well. I have noticed that I seem to survive everything that is thrown at me, the Black Hole was a testament to that. If you are concerned though, Niles, that perhaps I have lost my edge I can assure you..I have plans that will shake the foundation of this Galaxy and in doing so live up to my Father's destiny, and expectations. I spoke with him recently…Niles. He is not happy with how things have been going…But that changes today! Acquiring this forge will ensure that things go according to plan….I do what I do, for the good of the Empire…and for us, Niles. You trust me, do you not? This Forge is the key that will bring us into that land of history, and this time it will be re-written to say that the Sith won the day, and the Empire will thrive and be fulfilled. I ask you again. You trust me, do you not?"** This forge was the key. With it, he could possibly input those plans for the Death Star...and construct it...Krayt's end was nearer than he could ever realize. There was no 'One Sith'. The Rule of Two would be implemented again, Krayt would fall...and in his place Maleficere would bring The Empire into the glory it was meant to have, what Krayt could -never- hope to accomplish.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-05 18:05:25)

The chiss frowned a bit. "I want to trust you. But you've lost around 42,000 under your command now, have you even kept count? How does that make you feel about the missions? Was that ship worth Skywalker and your crew? Was it worth Daiyu? You do know Moff Tayus has tried to keep in contact with you about Project WA-3, but you went radio silent with her a long time ago. She was our only link to Ristrin and you let that go. Why? Has the Dark Side changed you so much?"
It seemed the Commander wasn't so much upset, yet he sought answers. Why was he so calm?

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-05 19:19:34)

Maleficere stood silent for a moment. **"Daiyu was not my doing. Krayt stationed her on the other side of the damn system and I did my best to get to her in time. The Vindicator was lost because I did not pilot it myself to the location…I tried to put faith in my crew, and let them try to show me that they were capable. They failed, obviously."** The calmness really bothered him, but he knew it was most likely Niles' training. **"As for Tayus…Once this bit is done, I will contact her and let her know things are going to plan. I am confident as ever that this will succeed, but…Perhaps it could not hurt to re-establish contact with her. I will do so after you and I are done."** If this was a double cross, oh there would be hell to pay. He wondered what the Probe's status was.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-06 04:54:38)

The chiss watched Malificere's mannerisms as he continued the conversation. "For some reason she felt I should personally watch over you and Daiyu. As well as myself. I was to see what you were up to. I guess she felt betrayed slightly at the lack of communication. We found out you were at Bastion and she wondered why you wouldn't respond to my communications months ago."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-06 09:57:26)

Maleficere honestly had no recollection of ignoring comms from anyone...well except maybe Tayus a few times but those were in dire situations. **"Look Niles. I am doing my best to try and hold Ristrin's plan together. But when people keep dying off left and right, it puts a ton of pressure on me. I play things close to the vest, that is how I have stayed alive for so long. It comes with the territory of being a Sith. All I ask from you and Moff Tayus is patience, and trust. I still have the plans Niles…Krayt will never get his hands on them, and if he does it will be too late. I cannot do this without officers like you, Niles…I need to know that we are still on the same page. Ever since his death, everything I have done has been for Ristrin's plan….and my father's vision."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-06 15:16:25)

The chiss paced about in HoloNet form. "Why wouldn't we be on the same page? I serve the Sith Empire and Moff Tayus has sought interest in our mission. But we don't even know what your agenda is. It seems to have changed. And you sound rather...resitant to Lord Krayt. Why would I have anything against my liege? He will lead us to victory against the Rebel terrorists and ineffective false Empire."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-06 17:21:26)

Maleficere blinked for a moment and raised an eyebrow. Niles knew that Ristrin wanted a new Emperor, and not Krayt in power....so why did he seem still irrevocably loyal to the man? He knew very well about the assassination attempt as well...If things continued then he would have to blow the boy up and say the forge did it. **"Of course he will Niles. I am merely saying that it was us who Ristrin wanted in charge of the project, and I plan to make sure that that stays on course. I will contact Moff Teyus now, and I will update you fully on what we discuss. I see now that you are simply wondering why you have been kept out of the loop, and I will remedy that. Circumstances were simply not in any of our favors at the time for me to contact you or anyone. I will contact you again very soon."**
Immediately, he cut the transmission and made to contact Teyus on the holo-net. While he did so he called out **"What is the probe's status?"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-06 20:47:41)

Lieutenant Leevold responded to the comlink transmission. **"My lord, the probe unit is scanning the installation right now. It's energy signatures match up to those in our databases of the Star Forge. We're transmitting the signal now. The Star Forge is not responsive."** 
The image of Moff Tayus appeared as the transmission went through, cutting off his conversation with Leevold. The medium length haired woman began speaking with a smile. **—"Ah, look who it is. You look a lot different than the last time we spoke. I've wondered why you've went radio silent with me for so long. I hear you've gotten quite the reputation as a Sith.—"**
The forty something year old didn't look half-bad to Malificere perhaps. She had aged well, although likely not as attractive as Shanica, she was definitely wiser than Shanica. That aura though, was hard to shake. He had met many Moffs who were only interested in advancing their own schemes. Moff Tayus seemed to show it more than ever now...but why was that? Did the silence that grew between them cause such awkwardness? After all, he had been told to keep in touch with her. It had apparently been Ristrin's wish.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-06 21:09:17)

Maleficere acknowledged the probe's progress before returning the smile to the Moff. **"You will forgive me, Moff Teyus, for not keeping in touch with you. There was…pandemonium. Everything is under control now and we are close to what Ristrin wanted. You will be saddened no doubt to hear of Daiyu's demise…but there is no time for mourning, as we are literally on the doorstep of history for us all. Normally, I would invite you to join me in person…but I am assuming that you would not be able to do so?"** He noted that despicable Aura, but now was not the time for rashness. If she was part of a plot it would be best to keep her within striking distance...at least he could go down killing a traitor. **"I will of course allow you to join me if you wish though. You of all deserve to be here since it was you along with Ristrin who orchestrated this for us."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-07 01:28:06)

Moff Tayus ran her hands through her brunette hair and adjusted her code cylinder pouches on her chest. "May I get SITREP as to what happened two years ago, and why you had remained radio silent on me for so long? I assigned you to rendezvous with Moff Alexander and then you went off the grid."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-07 10:41:39)

Maleficere visibly shuddered at the thought of what kept that from happening. **"I was….delayed….severely. Lord Krayt ordered us to go to his palace on Coruscant, and things went heavily overboard and out of control. I was given to the Shapers, Invictus as well. During those two years I was kept away from my ship and from having any communication…Had it not been for that then I would have kept in contact."**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-07 15:54:11)

Moff Tayus did not seem happy. "So you couldn't send me a SITREP anytime during the rendezvous mission and your incursion to Coruscant? What were you doing at Coruscant anyways? I was unaware at that time Darth Krayt was directly tasking you out."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-07 17:02:12)

Maleficere crossed his arms in front of him and raised an eyebrow. **"No, I could not. Roan Fel was with us. Had we made ANY attempt to contact you or anyone in the Empire it would have tipped him off that he was walking into a trap…Secondly, Krayt had no reason to tell you what I was doing…But it led to the destruction of Bastion, and Fel returned to the Force by our hand. As an exceptional Moff, certainly a little side work would not put you off…would it? Fel is completely out of our hair now. His daughter may or may not still be alive but once Ristrin's plan is completed she will be little more than dust in space, as will any traitor to the Empire. As far as I am concerned, that detour in the plans helped eliminate a lot of resistance to what we hope to accomplish."**

---

Moff Tayus seemed unsatifised but mutter forth a visage of of decency. "That doesn't explain the lapse in communication from your assignment with Moff Alexander. But yes, on orders from Krayt you don't have a choice. It seems you've gotten a vision of your own, without me to guide you. That wasn't the plan as you might recall."

Maleficere made a gesture of appreciation for her willingness to try to understand. **"An act that I am of course changing now. I would greatly appreciate your guidance in this matter, with no lack of communication this time on my part. It is time I do this right, and swiftly…which can only be done with you Moff Teyus. I understand now that I was foolish to try and guess Ristrin's wishes on my own, when you knew what they were. Help me once again, and this time….things will work out the way they were supposed to."**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-07 19:38:39)

The moff was now certainly displeased. "Why couldn't you be honest from the start? Are you hiding something? You were apart of the project from the start and suddenly you seemed to not want any hand in it."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-07 20:41:57)

Maleficere was now displeased as well, and it showed. **"Moff Teyus, All I said was that I wanted to try and do something on my own. I did not wish, at the time, to rely on the help of others…if anything it was pride rather than a supposed hidden agenda. Now, will you help me, or will I have to fulfill Ristrin's vision by myself…During this conversation I have been NOTHING but honest. Do not forget that I am a Sith Teyus, I outrank you and can either tell Krayt that you are not fit for command or tell him you are an asset to the Empire. Play games with me and the like, and I can assure you the first scenario will be the more likely. Now, can we play nice with each other? I want nothing more than to fulfill Ristrin's wishes, so saying I did not want a hand in it is complete and utter bunk."** He calmed down for a moment before saying **"I ask politely again, can we assist one another again…?"**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-07 21:03:45)

Moff Tayus intertwined her fingers and said with a smile. "Of course we can your highness, it's what I wanted to do all along. What's your situation looking like out there?"
((Perception as a reaction.))

His saavy tongue had not failed him yet. He had convinced her to commit back to his way of conducting matters. He felt it in the Force. She couldn't argue his rank or the fact Krayt would back him up. She was used to him being an Admiral, that was for sure.
Now she was simply asking for a sitrep, not ordering.

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-07 22:33:49)

Maleficere breathed in as he noticed this and breathed back out before saying **"Currently, I am at the Star Forge. Krayt wants Cade Skywalker found, and WE need somewhere to begin with what Ristrin wanted. There is an individual aboard the Forge who can help locate Cade, and perhaps I can find out if the Forge can accept the construction plans while aboard. We know the Forges can be used to construct it, why not use them?"**

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-07 23:34:20)

Moff Tayus looked confused. This was something new to her. "You have the blueprints?! Where did you find them? I was unaware you had access. Where are they?"
This seemed to be an odd revelation to the Moff.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-08 07:51:17)

Maleficere shook his head. **"I do not have them, I simply want to see and make sure that the Forge can accept them. As for where they are Teyus, I do not have them on me. Ristrin must have hidden them to keep them away from prying eyes and the wrong hands."** He then crossed his arms again and looked to her with skepticism. **"I just told you I was after Skywalker…and you did not even blink….yet as soon as I mention mere blue-prints…"** He waved it off as nothing, though inside he would hold on to that. Had Krayt gotten to her in his absence?

The Moff didn't waver in her speech as she responded. **—"In your absence, Commander Niles was directly reporting to me. He informed me recently that your fleet was pursuing Skywalker. I suppose it adds up you would eventually get such an assignment, it only confirms my beliefs. However, it does not surprise me. The mentioning of the Death Star plans however, would seem like an impossibility. You seemed to be quite ambitious by saying you would see if the Forge would recognize the Death Star blueprints, as if you already had them. It just had me…interested. I'm sure you can understand. But yes, let us work together from now on. I just hope I will not be forced to be kept uninformed of matters again. It was unpleasant to say the least."**

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-09 07:43:55)

Maleficere nodded in agreement. **"We will not have a re-peat I assure you. What I know, you will know…as soon as possible. Speaking of which, I am currently waiting on a probe to see if the defenses of the Forge can be shut off. Last time it was nearly a total disaster had it not been for Niles who managed to come through. I certainly hope that we do not have to engage it again."** He looked to the Captain as if in expectation that there may be some news yet. Patience with matters like this was never his strong point...But at least he had that data-pad from Ristrin's robes that had the plans on them.

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-10 03:58:52)

The middle aged captain stepped forward from the outside passageway into the slightly darkened HoloNet room. "My liege, the probe is still transmitting our message, with no response. The weapons and shields of the Star Forge are currently powered down. The station is also running at nominal power levels. There doesn't appear to be any anomalies but the droid is still scanning."

---

### **Maldoravia** (2013-04-10 07:46:32)

Maleficere blinked for a moment. What could it be about a probe, that did not make it attack but it would attack a ship...? They both had weapons, albeit the probe was only outfitted to simply keep it from being attack-.....**"By. The. Force…."** he muttered to himself. It seemed, at least to him, that the gigantic station was similar to a probe in that it could defend itself against the attacker....and seemed to have a programmed destination. It was essentially, to him, a gargantuan space probe. **"Very Well Captain. We will give it a few more minutes."**
He turned to look back now at Teyus with a smirk. **"Well one way or another we will get to it…Now, about our original topic….Being in the Dark, I believe? How are things on your end Moff Teyus?"**

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2013-04-10 22:05:47)

The Captain rendered a salute and went back outside to monitor the situation with the probe unit. Moff Tayus looked at Malificere slightly bemused as she couldn't tell who he was talking to. She then responded. **"Well, we're continuing research on the Star Forge in the Unknown Regions. However, for specific reasons I shortened the staff significantly that was conducting the research. I'm afraid the science personnel haven't made as much progress as we'd like. However, if you wish to check on the progress you may do so when you have the time. As far as the war goes, it seems reports are coming frequently from Bastion. It appears Marasiah Fel was destroyed. Fel's Empire has suffered a terrible loss and they are believed to be mobilizing to a new command center. Though we cannot confirm where. Your assignment will remain on Skywalker."**
