I have to say I thought today's session was quite compelling in the limited amount of time we had. Every player seemed to be roleplaying very well in the briefing room and got to exercise their educated characters. I was wondering if everyone felt smothered by the information I threw at you was too much to let you speak your own mind?
Again I don't think I've seen all the players contribute so much in a team effort and that's what this game is supposed to encourage at times; two heads are better than one.
I am eager to see the plan in motion now.
Anyone have thoughts about the session?

Smoothered? No..oh I guess when you were reading out the guidelines , think you repeated them three times until we go the point lol But didn't really feel smoothered don't think aftuer the guielines were out of the way.
Poor HK, he wanted oh so much to torch the furry buggers too.
I think our combat orientated players were itiching for a fight as they both went off to get prepared early lol

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-08 13:41:18)

That was Lieutenant Jordan, I had him roll a knowledge tactics check to say, "Hey, it's probably best to plan first before I tell my men what to do."

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-08 14:56:02)

Yeah and Zvi I think was keen to get out there as soon as we heard Pirates lol

### **zvi** (2012-04-10 13:43:26)

I didn't feel smothered.
I was eager for a fight that is correct but i also would have gone with not advancing the story and stay in the bar (after all its the first time Janelle agreed to join us and go there <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> )

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-10 13:51:54)

I advanced the story cause everyone seemed unsure as to what to do. And I needed to advance the story to have it prepared for next session. You want another fight though? That one kill isn't enough? You need a higher kill count? lol.

---

### **zvi** (2012-04-10 15:01:20)

Well, yeah :P

---

### **zvi** (2012-04-14 10:33:18)

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-15 02:58:48)

Well looks like we lost our newest diplomatic officer. He appeared to go through the proverbial revolving door..
On a plus note, I enjoyed watching the leadership devising a plan with their first contact toward the Alliance. And I also had fun introducing a new character that you saw "above" Moff Tayus in authority. And no ill never say whose ideas are better either lol.

### **zvi** (2012-04-15 03:33:23)

Sorry i had to leave in a hurry, my kid woke up so had to go.
We lost him, how? He was still around when i left and saw the session ended.
Can you update xp for the session?
and i am pretty sure we made the right decision of not attacking the allience on site because:
1. We were asked not to engage and be diplomatic as we can, if the allience have a base here they might have developed a relationship with the Ewok and if we attacked them it would have been seen as an hostile act on the Ewoks too.
2. Planetery bombardment would have surly messed up things with the locals, burning and bombing thier planet would not seem to be a peacful approcahe. (i have deja wu from another peacful mission we messed up with planetery bombardment which burned half the forest, lol)
3. We can bombard and kill everyone **after** we get what we came here for if that is what you want. (after all we are the imperials not the good guys, lol)
P.S
I just remebered that we can try and call the Moff and ask for instructions if shes still alive and not killed by the Sith that saw her talking to us. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-15 03:53:50)

I think his problem was that he didn't like the session that it was so short. He asked if the sessions were normally that short and at one point stop talking for the remainder of the session...he quit as soon as I said the session was over so I'm assuming he was disappointed.
But that seems like rather fair reasoning to me regarding the Alliance. But their exact capabilities remain unknown and what other forces they have at their disposal. They are effectively invincible in their current state from the air. So only a ground assault would be viable and don't see anyone taking that course of action...
Xp awarded was 1000.
On a side note, the Persuasion skill can be used to communicate simple messages to other species with gestures and such when their is a language barrier. The DC is set at 20 and increases/decreases on the target creatures intelligence.

Not really, your bad rolls means you get a 1 and that is an auto fail. lol

Welcome back! Is the Admiral to good to come have a drink in the Rusty Anchor? lol.....This is only for the working officers lol.

---

### **Maldoravia** (2012-04-15 19:51:56)

I can promise you Zvi....If someone orders any sort of bombardment without Alvar's permission now that I am back, he will shoot whoever was responsible...no questions asked....probably the last person that is on the ship that you want to tick off. Just a warning. On a side note...yes, Daiyu and I are back. Sorry if I seem on edge....We came back after ten days to our appartment to find a pipe had burst in the ceiling in our bathroom, and it cannot be fixed until tomorrow since no one is in the damn office until Monday. If they don't get it fixed by then, I will be demanding that they knock off at least a hundred dollars on our rent for the year. We have had too many maintenance issues that were never fixed in a timely manner and one we have still been waiting on for at least more than half a year. So again....sorry if I come across as taking this out on anyone its just I have had enough of this crap with the apartment management. Looking forward to playing again on Saturday.

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-16 02:46:16)

Good thing me or HK don't have authority to bombard anything then.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-16 03:36:04)

Something tells me the away team won't be roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories if they have to set up camp in Endor.

---

### **zvi** (2012-04-16 03:53:55)

Well, seems like Alvar is in a moody state <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
On another note, for sometime now, every time i try to suggest a course of action one of you pulls out a rank on me be it Alvar, Daiyu or Janelle. I am getting tired of this <!-- s:/ -->![:/](https://i.ibb.co/1fht9Fjq/icon-mad.gif)<!-- s:/ --> . if you want me to play an NPC in this camp it won't happen, meaning you can get an NPC but not me as a player.
I am here to suggest another course of action, but if you either pull out rank on me every time or say that i disobay orders, then you really take away all gaming opportunity for me as a player.
I am not even saying how it feels as a player that every time you want to do something you need to request permission from another player, which is annoying.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-16 04:06:59)

Look at it this way though Zvi: You are "just" a pilot. A squadron leader. In real life you would be an officer, true, but you would still answer to your superiors on orders...etc. A pilot will always be bound by orders from their seniors as they perform the orders outlined by them. You couldn't have a whole host of pilots doing what they wanted could you? There comes a point in a career when you stop doing and start delegating. You are still a doer. If you'd opted for a desk job....

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-16 04:44:48)

This is an important issue in the campaign and it needs to be addressed. A big part of the appeal of the game is letting the players make critical and large scale decisions. I want all players to be involved in that aspect of the game. I like to lean more to nobles than I do soldiers.
That's why I sort of went against the grain by allowing to have meetings where the Admiral consults all his men/women before making a decision. Its important that every PC contributes their leadership ideas to the success of the mission.
With that being said, the RP elements being highlighted, its still a military campaign. Ultimately at the end of the day, the ranking officer has the final say. Your characters were trained to follow orders, to the letter. Now, that also gives you a chance in the future to seek counsel with the leader you don't like and ask him or her why they made a particular decision. They don't have to explain it to you, but good officers typically do explain their decisions.
And being buried by rank should not completely discourage you. Rather it should inspire you to find ways to get yourself promoted. It won't be easy, but a poltical savvy officer will find a way up the ladder.

### **zvi** (2012-04-16 04:49:04)

Sorry to currect you but you are wrong, we are all bridge officers including me.
Again, i am not just a squadron leader i am in charge of all pilots and TIEs which are about 60-80 vehicles strong, the fact that i elect to keep my flight duty is irrelevent in this case.
Not to mention that you ignore the fact that if i can not even suggest a course of action in this game there is no reason for me to play.
I am not saying you need to accept my suggestions but you can't keep dismissing it every time as disobidience which was done almost in every session i played in.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-16 09:56:32)

Maybe it's just how I was brought up or my brief experience in the military, but every time I've spoken out of turn after an order/command. I've been reprimanded. Regardless of whether I've been right or wrong. You just get respite in the knowledge of: "Told ya so." when things go tits up.

---

### **zerah** (2012-04-16 10:22:33)

sorry...when have any of us repremanded you for stating opinion icly?

---

### **Maldoravia** (2012-04-16 12:38:51)

Alvar has never reprimanded anyone for stating an IC opinion. He gives his feedback and at the end of the day he makes the call, sometimes with the senior officers and sometime without. The only person he has -ever- reprimanded was Niles.....and that was for 1, Lying to his face, and 2, giving the go ahead with the lie that the Admiral had said it was okay for a new bar. Those were the only times he has really reprimanded -anyone-. As for when I say "Get ready to be shot if such and such happens WITHOUT Alvar's approval..." I am just being totally honest. If something so detrimental was ordered behind his back, of course there will be repercussions. I am not saying don't do it, I am merely saying be ready for the consequences that will follow....the realistic consequences for the Empire. As I recall Zvi....Alvar has never really reprimanded you at all, and neither have I.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-16 15:32:11)

Now I'm getting concerned. In the Galaxy at War sourcebook it warns to never let one officer get too much of the spotlight. I'd like everyones opinion on this.. Do you all feel that I'm letting one or two officers get all the attention at the expense of the others? To the point where the game is unbalanced or boring?

### **zerah** (2012-04-17 09:25:15)

I don't see how. Seriously. All of us make decisions with each other. The only time that didn't really happen was when Alvar and I left guidelines. It wasn't that we were saying, we're the senior most and these have to be followed, the stop we laid out was stuff that should seriously have been common sense to a diplomatic situation. In the end, everyone the past two sessions had the freedoms to choose not to follow them, with consequences of course. I mean...seriously, you're going to a planet where the primary race is primitive, had been oppressed by the empire and forced it to retreat. Diplomacy was the best logical way to get the information needed, why would anyone wear the armor of those that hurt them, or bring in the weapons that they know how to fight against. that's just poor planning, everything we said was simply logical. Sorry went on a bit of a rant there..

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-17 11:42:54)

Ewoks were oppressed by the Empire? When did that happen? I just thought they passed them off as primative and not to be considered a threat.
If the empire had a decent spindoctor they would have said: "You see what the Alliance did?! They blew up that lovely big moon in the sky, raining firey hell down on you and your race of people. And you call us the bad guys?!"
How old do Ewok's live anyway? 40-60? So that's like 2 or 3 generations ago anyway. Enough time to forgive and forget. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-22 03:13:43)

So when I woke up the game was still going!
Recap:
Alliance bombed the base. Daiyu and Tehert nearly killed.
Shuttled all personnel back to the Adjudicator.
Launched a ground assault. HK was leading it.
Ridiculously heavy resistance.
HK Dead. 3 ATSTs lost. 1 ATAT kill 1 ATAT mobility kill.
Orbital bombardment. Base Toast. Some starfighters escaped. Too fast for our TIEs.
The diplomat types headed back to the surface.
Teheret scouted ahead and found the pilots hiding in the Ewok village. Killed 4, wounded the last. Lost visual.
Regrouped back at base. Before heading back out on the diplomatic mission.

---

### **zvi** (2012-04-22 13:30:46)

Wow! that many loses?
I guess a frontal assault is always a costly matter, especially when you do not know what your up against. (no big loss about HK <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> )
Did we loose TIE's and pilots?
I also understand that in the end the attack took out the shield generator and thats why the bombardment was successful?
XPs?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-22 13:47:51)

5000 XP. And no, no TIE fighters were destroyed.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-22 14:31:26)

No TIEs were destroyed. They weren't much use because of the AA which couldn't be knocked out because of the ground turrets that were fking up our Armour, which was also being fucked up by the Y wings above.
One of the ATATs spotted teh shieldgen and took it out. Inside the facility were hundreds of rebels. Now they're alllllllll toast. Anyone keeping a kill count? :P
Poor HK....his assault was truly memorable <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-22 19:44:21)

HK was a misunderstood comrade. Despite his ruthless tactical advisements and common references to humans being meatbags, he was ready to fight and die for his crew. I think a lot of the PC's didn't realize that. Daiyu and Niles I know did.

---

### **Sprog** (2012-04-23 05:54:11)

Jeesh. I miss one session and there's dead people everywhere.

---

### **zvi** (2012-04-23 05:58:09)

Misunderstood? He threathened to kill some PC's.
How can you devise from that the he really would give his life to save yours?
Sorry, I am still not saddened by his "death".

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-23 09:20:07)

Yeah Daiyu ain't a pretty girl any more. The Imperial Surgeons aren't great at cosmetic surgery we found out <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Poor HK <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> He will be missed. Chances of survival were 271 to 1 on his own (so he was sent with a couple of squads :p) I hope he killed an ewok en route to the base....so he could die 'happy' having 'smelt' their burning fur.
Also turns out one shot from our turbolasers as an orbital barrage is ridiculously powerful, surprised we didn't blow a hole through Endor.

---

### **zvi** (2012-04-23 14:30:14)

She has our master's light saber, so she is starting to resemble him.
If i remember he was not a pretty site without his mask :P

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-23 14:48:05)

Well the latest development is that the closest village to the Imperial landing facility is now surrounded by 2 platoons of unarmored stormtroopers. That village is where the pilots were taken out by the scout troopers/Lt Terseht. Apparently, one pilot is wounded. The Admiral's current sentiment seems to consist of moving into the village and capturing the wounded pilot for interrogation. It seems the Admiral wants the entire crew to help interrogate that one pilot. That is if the pilot is still alive.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-25 08:06:35)

Heads Up: May not be fully available for the game on Saturday, if at all.
In another note, I ended up playing Risk online 'til 3am last night. Very tired.
In another another note, my office made the news here in Luxembourg. I think they must have heard about all the explosions in our last game, because we had a bomb threat. Sniffer dogs, tonnes of hurtlocker police and we were all evacuated.

So what I miss?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-29 09:16:38)

The crew had a bit of a disagreement during the planning to go into the ewok village. Some of the troops morale was affected and Captain Daiyu was ordered to be restrained to her quarters by the Admiral. The Admiral decided to rescind this order after all. The debate started after the ewoks had found the stormtroopers and took their comlink and started speaking into it. Terseht had to translate and the woks thought it was a means to communicate with the gods.
The next morning, the group set out early to the ewok village to use the gods concept to their advantage. They promised the ewoks food and equipment all in hopes to trade information. It was 4 hour movement through the woods and Janelle got fatigued as they pushed repulsorlift cargo crates. They made some encounters with the friendly wild life along the way.
Eventually they made they arrived at the ewok village only to suffer an attack from archers. The ewoks fired at the M7 droid, calling him the "Night Demon". The party did not return fire at the ewoks and took down M7. This made them look good and the ewoks appreciated the gallantry of the heroes who defeated a demon.
The group then introduced a silver protocol droid, TC-17. They worshipped the droid and away team as a "God" and their "champions". With that, the group distributed rations and spare part which erupted the ewoks into a curious fervor. One ewok even paraded around with a R2 unit dome as a helmet.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-29 09:32:30)

Despite their apparent culture victory with the furry locals, things would get worse from there. Admiral Alvar asked where Lunariss the ewok shaman was at, they had no idea. But they did know where the Alliance X wing pilot was. One ewok took the away team to the wounded pilot's bedside inside a small hut. Sure enough, there was a sleeping Alliance pilot.
The group quickly hatched a plan and allowed Captain Daiyu to handle negotiations to get the pilot to come with them. The female immediately awoke in an alerted status, ever conscious that they were imperials. The imperials tried to convince the woman nicely to come with them but she insisted she was leaving at the site of the armed imperials. She asked to leave and made her way past the cadre of officers.
Captain Daiyu did not want her to get away so she grabbed her wrists as the pilot went to her X-wing. The pilot believed she was at the imperials mercy so she made a desperate move to escape. She slipped her wrists free then drew a blaster on Captain Daiyu, holding her at gunpoint. The crew was now in a hostage situation.
The pilot put Daiyu in a choke and kept the blaster barrel in Daiyu's temple, threatening to shoot if the imps tried anything. She then gave the admiral instructions for escape. The party looked on in frustration as they were basically powerless to act against the pilot without risking Daiyu being killed. The Admiral obeyed all the hostage takers demands and had her X wing powered up for her.
The pilot got into the ship after quickly releasing Daiyu. Snipers made two shots at the pilot but missed as her cockpit was sealing. The x wing escaped and the Star destroyers began to scan for the x wing to no avail. Now Admiral Alvar wants the x wing pilots blood, and Daiyu showed signs of extreme distress at the harrowing experience.

Oh wowsa! Cheers for the recap! So dead end on the search for the 'cron?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-29 14:06:01)

Yes, it seems the only possible lead has vanished with the X-wing. The Admiral has said that the pilot is now his personal "Moby Dick". There was also an ewok shaman listed as a possible lead, Lunariss.
The hostage situation was very dramatic though, I think the party was shook up. I think Sam (Daiyu) was probably feeling the same thing you did when Horatio was being beat to death.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-29 16:15:02)

Yikes. Tough times. If you've got the logs I'd love a read thru of the hostage sitch

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-29 21:46:13)

BTW; Niles, Jordan, and Blake are free to RP in the PBP thread "HoloNet" to send messages to Moff Kane. This will be a permanent addition to the campaign.

---

### **zvi** (2012-04-30 02:12:34)

DW, i rmember you mentioned you will create an XP tree so each one will know how much XP he got from each session.
Will you be creating one soon, so i will know how much i got from last game?
Must have missed some information, but why is the Allience pilot the lead for the item we are searching for?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-30 02:23:47)

Blake would have to ask his leadership. But I think it's because the Admiral wanted the pilot as a lead to see what that person knew about Endor and its inhabitants to help find the Holocron. The XP tree will be coming soon and you got 1000 XP from last session. Also, there is a PBP thread open now called the HoloNet. It is used to stay in contact with Moff Alexander Kane. A powerful political figure should not be squandered as an ally.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-30 05:02:55)

And so the HoloNet thread is up and running! It should be a great supplement to the campaign and keep the momentum of the story going between missions.

Ok the first wave of updates are complete. The threads: "Moff Council, Legate Crew Performance, and the hostage situation scene is in the storyline discussion thread." Feel free to check out the new additions!

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-02 04:19:29)

oooo that was a good read <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I enjoyed that.
Hindsight is a wonderful thing but I'm surprised no one opted for Demand Surrender (as was suggested) or tried to disarm her or got the Ewoks to jump on her and rip her to shreds, feasting on her insides (it's what they do.honest)

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-02 04:21:25)

P.S. Moff Council thread is awesome <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> It's like Governmental planning/Sim City <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-02 14:18:09)

Maybe one day you will be governing your own sector as a Moff?
But as far as Demand Surrender, the opponent has to be reduced to 1/2 hp or less...that wasn't the case with the pilot...as the female pilot had a lot of hp. (hint hint).

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-03 01:53:03)

The experience thread is now up. It will be updated after every session.

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-03 03:38:32)

Also what does it mean by: "CL 2 Proficiency"

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-03 03:47:24)

Its what I use to measure the overall crew performance. I average out all of your CL's to determine the crew's quality. Each key officer contributes CL by their overall leadership. The scale of the CL is -1 to 4. CL -1 Below Average, CL 0 Average, CL 1 Skilled, CL 2 Expert, CL 3 Elite, CL 4 Ace. Each PC's CL is a reflecting of their performance, leadership, and decision making in the game.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-03 04:41:45)

Oky dokely! Niles will have to try harder, his performance is unacceptable!

Jaybee you missed my fight <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> which i almost lost.
The other Xwing is more like an ex-craft, but i leveled to 12.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-06 17:25:26)

The X-wing is at -2 right now with 11 HP. It should be operational but might sustain some permanent damage to its systems.

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-06 17:51:23)

Can our techs build up one fully operational out of the two damaged ones?

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-06 17:55:40)

Shouldn't be a problem, though it may take some time.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-07 03:30:37)

Your fight? Ex-X-Wing lol Against who? The escaped pilot?

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-07 03:31:45)

Grats on the levels too...I think I'm close to 12, should be closer after the last sesh hopefully.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-07 05:18:24)

He got attacked by a 27 foot tall furry, giant bipedal creature called a Gorax. The Gorax ripped a tree out of the ground and bashed his X-wing into the ground and Blake was unable to get it airborne again. He managed to escape and evade into the woods and lay down fire at the beast till he was dead. Blake had dropped to 45 hp and one more hit would have killed him.
The X-wing from the Gorax's tree swipe was reduced to 11 hp and -2 on the condition track.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-07 05:41:26)

It knocked the Xwing out of the sky?

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-07 08:12:20)

No, Blake landed the x-wing in the clearing after it was getting too dark to continue to survey the nav points.
Then he requested a Storm troopers detachment to help guard the x-wing, after climbing down from the cockpit, Blake noticed something in the trees so he tried to back away into the xwing.
He made it in but the creature started to bash the x-wing with the tree stump and after about 2 hits the nose was stuck into the ground so he could not use it to fight it and he ran off into the woods.
The creature, was much quicker. Blake plan was to try and avoid a confrontation with it cause he only had a heavy blaster pistol.
After a few attempts to hide from it, Blake realised it was not going to work. so as a last resort he started fighting it hoping to dely it enough for the storm trooper to arrive.
It appears Blake was too nimble for the creature to hit him (Ref 30 unarmored, lol) and gave it many wounds with the blaster.
DW was really out to get me so he used FP for the creature against me <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> and the creature hit Blake with a tree stump causing a serious wound (about 55 HP damage).
Things got worse as Blake was now wounded and at -1 on attacks and defense, yet luck was with him and he was still nibmle enough to avoid being hit.
Finally Blake heard the ST in the distance and the creature decided it had enough with the small and nimble creature which caused it serious damage and he tried to escape.
Blake was raged at the xwing damage and the adrenaline was also flowing in him so he took another shot at it and hit the creature spine which caused it to fall to the ground.
He then approached it and put the creature out of its misery with 2 shots to the head.
Finally the STs arrived and Blake wounded and beaten sat down with his back to a tree fatigued.
He requested the ST sergent to help cut the creature head off and help him carry it and Blake himself to the village.
The Sergent asked how Blake killed the creature and Blake showed him the pistol and told him he was trained as a ST in his past himself. The sergent was very surprised by the fact that Blake had ST training and managed to kill the 27 foot creature with only a pistol.

LIKE A BOSS!
Sounds like a good fight and bloody lucky you had a high ref! Lol @ DW using an FP....but you did land a starship in a clearing in a forest....why didn't you fly it back to base? :P
Let's hope the Ewok's don't worship the Gorax.
Still bloody good show on the killing a giant front!

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-07 10:02:40)

it not just a clearing in the forest its the clearing we used to land the shuttle with the techs near the Ewok village.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-07 10:37:38)

Ah ok...so less than 500m away!! Wow it was danger close!

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-07 14:42:53)

The Gorax only had 2 FP at its disposal. It had 146 HP and +18 to hit with melee. I had to roll a 12 to hit Blake and I was basically rolling 3-8's with the Gorax. The Gorax also could recover 5 HP per turn as it had fast healing. But yea, just one more hit by the Gorax would have kllled Blake. But the Gorax had got wounded down to -2 during the fight.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-07 15:34:00)

Blake must have been laying down a hell of a lot of fire to take off that much health though!

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-07 15:45:42)

It looked like an epic fight of a man vs. beast.
I was sure Blake was not going to make it.
Yeah, Blake fired many times at the creature and got 20+ damage on most of the hits with the h. blaster (3d8+5).
I think Blake missed only one shot (probably because its very hard to miss a giant 27 feet tall standing next to you <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> )

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-07 15:54:43)

Heh yeah! Wow didn't realise blasters did that much damage! 4.5*3 + 5 per hit on average. Yeah makes sense now. No crits or DPs used?

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-07 16:47:04)

nope, no DP or crits happened.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-07 23:35:30)

I have updated the Imperial Personnel Dossiers. The closest Officers to promotion at this time are Blake and Niles. Blake is close to Commander and Niles is close to Captain. Niles is just 3 points away from Captain, and when you level up and take officer candidacy you would only be 1 pt away from Captain, thanks to the scoundrel level you won't have it after level up lol.
Anyways, Niles might be picking up Captain soon. So that means the bridge won't be big enough for Daiyu and Niles at the same time. I'm thinking of giving you command of the Venerator in flight time. And resuming normal PC activity for the away teams. IDK yet....but its unlikely to have two captains on one bridge. Unless someone gets demoted soon.

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-20 06:31:09)

So what was the outcome of yesterday's session?
I left when you decided to make your way to the shuttle.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-20 06:36:34)

Waited at the shuttle for 3 days then got attacked by an Alliance ground assault. Every retreated to the Ewok village.
Niles managed to bag the enemy commander after Alvar successfully got them to surrender and flee by waving his lightsaber and threatening to kill all he Ewoks with a bomb from your Y Wing.
Then I fell asleep before the interrogation and anything else.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-20 14:05:31)

Commander Logana was dragged to an Ewok hut and continued to remain hostile to her captors. Captain Daiyu had read an entry of Logana's datapad that had revealed Lieutenant Lightus gave the waypoints up to the Alliance to find the away team. Meanwhile, two stormtrooper platoons had gave chase to the fleeing Alliance soldiers. Unfortunately, the Alliance used close air support and killed all but 3 people out 2 platoons with carpet bombing.
Admiral Alvar hosted the interrogation, which he was seemingly nice to Logana at first...but then Logana believed the two were Sith because they had lightsabers. And she told them she'd tell the Alliance every chance she got that they were Sith. Alvar didn't get much intelligence from the Commander. Not long after this, Alvar killed Logana with a lightsaber to her chest, in a graphic manner I don't want to repeat. He then beheaded her and then asked for her head to be skinned and her skull polished. He dumped the dead body out of the back of the ewok hut and the party decided to move out of the village.
Lieutenant Terseht, all the while, had been keeping friendly relations during the interrogation with the Ewok Chieftain, Derpeet.

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-20 14:18:14)

She wasn't far off when she thought he is a Sith, did she?
Well Lt. Commander Blake will consider his next move, shooting a photon torpedo at Admiral Alvar will not be too extreme a meseaure for him. that is after the admiral will exit the village, he is not about to fire on civilians.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-20 15:56:26)

Well apparently my Alliance NPC's are being scrutinized as "stupid" for not listening to Admiral Alvar while in captivity.

---

### **zerah** (2012-05-20 17:37:34)

seriously? you're going to do this here? after everything we just talked about? yes I see that that was posted earlier but still that's rather low; i tried my damned hardest to explain my own thoughts on things and, no you know what. f it. And zvi? seriously? you think he would have actually ordered a bombing? on civilians? seriously? have you -not- been playing? then again you really don't seem to do much but stand by waiting for something exciting to happen instead of joining up with anyone else even when -ordered- to. w/e.

Someone needs to realize that we are not in the Alliance, and that we are -run- by the SITH EMPIRE. Threatening to bomb the Village was justifiable seeing as the battle was going south. If Blake wants to be potentially stupid and have the Moff's get involved and possibly execute him...Then by all means go ahead. I have no problem with the torpedo action if Blake is ICly an alliance sympathizer, but if he is true to the Empire then he should very well see it as a dependable action. Alvar's actions potentially saved the entire group's asses. Seems like someone is getting a a 'small' dose of lightsaber envy. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

The experience has been updated. And in addition to that, I'm adding a new rule when it comes to experience. Roleplay XP. Those who roleplay with quality and purpose will receive an additional 1000 XP. The numbers will scale up as you level up. You also get this in addition to your XP modifier.

My two cents, not taking sides or anything, just how Niles sees things, politically or otherwise.

You can have an employer that is the most evil person in the world, it doesn't mean you have to believe their mantra. You can believe in the Empire, but not in the Sith way of doing things, no?

To be honest, if he's capable of skinning a skull and polishing it. I'm pretty certain how it could appear that he's capable of mass murder. Bluff or not. Niles would have gone ahead and done it....he's -still- yet to have an Ewok Steak and I'm sured underneath all that fur they're pretty tasty.

Wish I'd been able to attend the interogation since I brought her in <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->, but, alas again, the working week got the better of me. <!-- s:red: -->![:red:](https://i.ibb.co/xStHX79F/icon-redface.gif)<!-- s:red: -->

Actually....All it was was a point blank ignition to her chest, while holding her hair in a firm grip....Really nothing you hadnt said already in that post...

Ok this is starting to get out of hand. I know the Alliance has killed several of your men but its no reason to get OOCly annoyed at one another. Everyone is doing just fine in the game (well one player is not, but if you're reading this it isn't you.) and you've managed to avoid the superior Alliance forces at least. That being said let me set the record straight on the issues here.
First, there's nothing wrong if Zvi (Blake) chooses to disagree with an order or even refuse an order in game. This happened in the last campaign where officers didn't agree with their decisions and refused to follow orders. All I ask is that you understand the setting, which I'm sure Zvi does. If you refuse a direct order in the Sith Empire, you will face in-game repercussions because that is just how the story is.
Now the bombing run. Yes I took control of Blake because the party really needed him as they were outnumbered by Alliance forces. But once I realized that he was going to be outnumbered I withdrew his character from battle. I cannot risk a PC who is not there to defend themselves. I just don't agree with it...realism or not....your PC should not be killed because you are incapable of playing the game at that moment in time. But the issue remains if Blake should face punishment for not pressing the attack on the Alliance. Some people want this to continue for the sake of realism...but again...it's a sticky situation because Zvi was not there to engage the enemy Y-wings or make his own decisions. But I was not about to send Blake to his death while he wasn't there. I guess we will have to work on this issue more.
And I feel I must mention this because it's a personal note from me. I REALLY want to complete this game, in its entirety. I want everyone to enjoy the storyline and I don't want another Code Sagetim on our hands. I put a lot of effort into this game to make sure everyone has fun so we just need to all just put the personal issues aside and just play the game. I understand people's emotions get involved because we put everything into our characters (mine do too, especially in reference to my npc's). We're all going to make mistakes, I make a bajillion of them, but we need to keep the story going because I promise everyone is going to have fun and you will all get to do great things if you keep your heads on straight and not make this a personal mud sling fest. That being said, if these personal issues continue I will have no choice but to start just booting players. That is my last resort...but I don't want my campaign ruined again...I'm sorry....I just don't. I want someone at the end of the game to say..."Thanks man, that was fun."
It's not going to get any easier. I'm not going to pull any punches, and rest assured more PCs will die. So everyone needs to work as a team OOCly and most importantly ICly. If you don't like the Empire and push too hard against their ideals, don't be surprised if your character becomes an NPC. I'm sorry...just can't have the flow of the story disrupted.
Now feel free to add any remarks, questions, or concerns you all may have.

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-22 00:54:25)

The Moff Council Chamber thread has been updated, go there if you want to read something. Also, their will be a side quest this week.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-22 03:27:48)

Ah I do enjoy the Moff thread <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Bureaucracy at it's best :p

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-23 15:31:12)

I have made two updates. One in the Moff Council thread, (Which may affect your reinforcements), and an update to the Side Quest thread.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-23 15:40:20)

Yeah, can't make the SQ (time constraints) and I don't think I'll be making the MQ either.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-23 15:43:37)

But the party needs you...they need you to capture more high value targets. I'm sure next they will want the Captain of the Viscount alive...

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-23 15:47:13)

Sarcasm?

Not sure i will make it to the game this week either, but that is apperently unimportant unless there's an action sequense.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-25 04:27:57)

How was the SQ?

Quit being a jerk, also I fixed your spelling errors. Let's just try to move on and have a good campaign, k? There is no point in staying upset at someone's opinion.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-27 04:20:00)

How was the MQ?

---

### **Maldoravia** (2012-05-27 08:58:47)

No one showed up, so we couldn't do it. We felt like everyone should be included in the rescue.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-29 00:35:33)

The Moff Council Forum has been updated, if anyone wishes to read it.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-30 17:04:21)

Oooo so that's what he looks like <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-31 01:59:30)

Well, in my eyes, he looks less of a starwars character and more like someone from a general fantasy setting, but my knowledge of SW is only based on the movies.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-31 02:52:57)

Yeah you should see the Vong

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-31 14:20:27)

Yeah, met the vong on the last camp, not really fitting in my eyes also, too fantasy like.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-31 15:02:20)

Someone not a big fan of the Expanded Universe? Well Krayt is just a human who wears armor. The armor may not fit your perception of Star Wars, but armor is not a weird concept in Star Wars to begin with. The Yuuzhan Vong were a race that came from another galaxy so their weirdness is explained.
But sometimes I wonder why you don't play in Rebellion era campaigns Zvi cause that seems to be your favorite lol. If it wasn't for EU the only universe we'd have to play in is the Clone Wars animated series, the movies, and the Force Unleashed.

---

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-31 21:03:20)

Orbalisk armour is even weirder than what Krayt is wearing :P

Well, my knowledge is based only on the movies, never took the time to read the books or anything, read a little on the web but not too much.
I do not have a problem with armor, after all, all stormtroopers wear it <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> it just that this one does not seem fit, again in my eyes.
I don't play in the rebellion era because you don't, lol.
I only play SW with you, so if your next game will be in the rebellion era? hint hint, i will get to play in that era <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **jaybee3** (2012-06-01 06:09:10)

I love how it's referred to the Rebellion Era and it only lasts 5 years :p I always envisage eras as lasting decades <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
