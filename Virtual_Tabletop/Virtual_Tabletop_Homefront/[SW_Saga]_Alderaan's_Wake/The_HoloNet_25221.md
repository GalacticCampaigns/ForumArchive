# The HoloNet

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-04-29 15:12:12)

Onboard the Imperial landing pad on Endor, the Nune Class shuttle sat peacefully on this afternoon at about 1213. At the moment; Lieutenant Commander Blake, Lieutenant Jordan, and Commander Niles were handling administrative duties of the patrol mission. These men knew there was a HoloNet transceiver onboard the Nune Shuttle, and if they wanted to, they could instantly contact the man who has been eager to receive updates on their mission....that man was Moff Alexander Kane.

Niles had just filling in his previous battle report in triplicate. Every shot fired needed to be logged for expense and audit purposes. He would also need to review his handling of the previous mission to see what he could have done better from a tactical perspective.
*'Shields down then orbital bombardment was always the viable fallback but perhaps if HK had attacked the AA turrets or managed to find the power generator inside, our TIEs could have gained aerial superiority and destroyed the AT turrent for our walkers to move in unimpeded, minimising casualties and potentially securing the base.'*
The chiss scratched his matte of black hair, his eyes flicking over his report again, musing on other strategies all of which required more time and preparation, something that was out of his grasp.
*'I suppose we better report our progress to the Moff. But being the bearer of bad news…that's never an easy task.'*
Niles tapped on his console once more, initiating a link with the Moff.

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-04-30 04:58:58)

Kane would answer the link quickly, sitting behind an obsidian desk, behind him was a window in the shape of the imperial crest with stars beyond, to either side of him were a pair of combat droids. Kane seemed mildly surprised but pleased. 
"Hello commander Niles. It is agreeable to be contacted by you."
 He picks up a glass from his desk, swirling it before sipping at it then setting it down back in its place, savoring the drink before swallowing it down. 
"I have been wondering why your crew has been around Endor while the Alliance influence there is so insignificant. I would have expected your ship to have been reported somewhere more significant, Perhaps you could clarify your purpose in that area for me? I would also very much like to know how the crew has been performing?"
 His brows would furrow with concern as he asks the second part.

### **jaybee3** (2012-04-30 06:00:33)

Niles continues to tap away at the coms making sure that it's a secure transmission before continuing.
**"The pleasure is all mine, Your Illustriousness. As you may or may not know, even though it would please me to serve on the front lines it is not our mission perogative to do so. Although that is not to say we haven't encountered any Alliance threat in the vacinity. Our current mission is a diplomatic one with the furr– *Ewoks* here on Endor."**
Niles paused to correct himself, nearly letting slip his disdain for the short furry lifeforms, before continuing.
**"We were to establish a base of operations in the area. However, it seems that the Alliance beat us to it and have, or at least, *had* significant forces in the area. After sustaining a hit from our adversaries, we launched a ground assault on their position, knocking out their base of operation's shield generator, before hitting them with a bombardment from the Adjudicator. Wiping out all but a few stragglers from the region."**
The Chiss sighed, rubbing his temples, before continuing.
**"We are unable to pertain at this point whether these individuals have made it offworld or to another outpost on the planet's surface. So we remain ever vigilant of an Alliance counter offensive in the system."**
The Commander smiled before he answered the second half of the question, turning to his two comrades either side of him.
**"As with any crew, we have our ups and downs and certain choices on my part could have been a bit, how should I put this, well thought out on my part. But I think we're getting through it and are performing well as a unit now."**

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-04-30 13:03:13)

Kane smirks a bit at the title Niles had given him, he waves his hand. 
"Please, be relaxed, you may simply call me Moff or Kane. Ewoks..."
He says with a considering look and a nod. 
"Ah yes, the small furred creatures of that moon, it is interesting that the mission is a diplomatic one...How is this mission proceeding? And who assigned it to you, or did you undertake it of your own initiative?"
 He would pick up a dataslate from the corner of his desk and tap through the information on it for a moment. 
"How effective was the ground invasion? Did you sustain heavy losses? And what is your plan for attempting to track down those that escaped, if they remain on the planet or in the system?"
Kane would then set his slate aside and crosses his arms before him.
"Ahh I see, Hopefully those low points will be ironed out before long... Perhaps I should come see for myself how your pacification of the moon is progressing. Though, that reminds me... What do you know of a project known as WA-3?"
He asks, his cool grey eyed regard staring at the chiss, giving the illusion of looking directly to his eyes, though lightyears seperated the two.

### **jaybee3** (2012-05-02 04:51:01)

Pleased at the dropping of titles, Niles answered, Kane's began to answer Kane's questions, until crackly static came threw on the comms on another channel, updating him on the current situation.
**"Excuse me, Kane, that was just an update."** Niles took a deep breath before continuing. **"It seems that the last pilot from the Alliance base has escaped our grasp. There was a hostage situation with one of the senior officers, Captain Daiyu. Neither the Adjudicator nor the Venerator could track the craft as it made it ascended into orbit."**
He pauses once again before returning to the Moff's original question to further enlighten him of their mission.
**"The diplomatic mission with the Ewoks was just a cover, we were supposed to track an individual named Lunariss, but this too has drawn a blank. The details of who are still a little sketchy, but we think she may be linked to a Star Forge that we encountered before coming to this mess. The order came from a Moff Taysus*, he seems very keen keeping it on the low. Although I see the merit in a station that can seemingly harness the power of a star to what it would appear, create infinite vessels, if it were to fall into our adversaries' hands it could prove pivotal in our war."**
Niles himself picked up a datapad with his report of the ground invasion on the Alliance base, before reeling off the losses.
**"Key personnel losses: HK-500, assassin droid. Armour losses: Numerous AT-ATs and AT-STs. Air Losses: Nil. Encountered much greater resistance than expected in the attack. AA and AT towers along with waves of bombers. An attempt was made by the droid to infiltrate the facility and knock out the power generator to render these defenses useless to our attack, which would have expeditating creating a base on the planet, along with gathering invaluable intel on our enemy. However, the droid and his ghost teams met considerable resistance inside and they too fell to e-web fire. Knocking out the shield generator, the order was then given to bombard the base, wiping out any trace of the Alliance before they could gain intelligence from the droid."**
NIles took a sip from his canteen, his throat becoming dry with his constant speech.
**"He managed to track the pilots to the Ewok village and took all of them out, bar the aforementioned. Our best chances of tracking down the individual, would be scouring the wreckage of the base, setting a trap for an Alliance counter offensive in the system, or scanning for jump holes in the system."**
The chiss sighed, he knew that tracking the jump signature of a starfighter was nigh on impossible, but it was worth a shot if they could redirect power to their sensor systems.
**"You are more than welcome to visit the moon, yourself, Moff. It seems that the Ewok's have fallen for our offers of gifts and regard us as a liason with the gods, the gods being droids. It seems they worship shiny things."**
The commander rolls his eyes at how primative the people were before continuing, intrigued by something he hadn't heard of, cocking his eyebrow.
**"WA-3? Only rumours from the other officers but nothing concrete."**

LT. Commander Blake landed the captured ywing in a forest clearing, he was too tired to continue to fly above the forest canopy.
HE skillfuly manipulated the computer screen to get the long range communicator running so he can report the disastrous situation the mission has come to, to Moff Alexander.
"This is LT. Commander Blake, can you read me, sir? The situation has become dire and I need to report it."
Lt Commander Blake, then shuts down every other equipment that he can, so as to give as lower energy emittion as he can from the bomber and awaits the reply from the other side.

---

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-05-13 23:29:23)

Blake would be kept waiting only a short while before a familiar voice crackles over the com
 This is Moff Kane, what is the report? What has been happening Lt Commander? 
Kanes voice was as calm as ever even though Blake had told him the situation was dire

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-14 15:33:55)

Lt. Commander Blake hears the calmness in the Moff voice and calms himself down also.
"Sir, we have lost the Venerator and the Adjudicator was crippled badly.
The Adjudicator has fallen into our enemies hands.
We ourselves were on the planet when our starships were attacked by an enemy star destroyer. We are now marooned on the moon.
I am reporting this through a long range comms from a captured enemy vessel I am using and am not sure for how long I can keep this channel open or continue to report before we ourselves will get captured or killed."
Lt. Commander Blake takes a deep breath and awaits the Moff reply waiting to hear if the calmness will be gone with his reply.

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-05-17 00:13:19)

The link would be silent save for a few moments, then a few more as the Moff takes in this news. In his office Alexander rubs his forehead and then reaches over to an obsidian box on his desk, drawing out a cigarra, cutting off the tip and lighting it up. He takes a few puffs and then nods his head.
 "Very well, I will re route to your location… What faction did this destroyer belong to? And if you are in an enemy vessel where is the rest of your command crew?" 
His voice was still calm, though a shade or two cooler now that he had been told what happened.
 "And were your storm troopers really so ineffective that they lost the ship, or did they have inside help in seizing your vessel?

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-17 01:49:44)

Lt Commander Blake hears the slight change of tune in the Moffs voice and continues the report.
"Be advised, Sir, this is a SSD vessel that appeared in the sector and it belongs to the Alliance. The Adjudicator…sur…surrendered after the Venetor was destroyed and her hyperspace engines were hit and it could no longer escape. The enemy commander threatened to destroy the Adjudicator if they did not surrender, there was not much that the storm troopers could have done.
The rest of the command crew and a detachment of Storm troopers are on the moon surface making their way to a specific way point that the Ewoks regard has holy.
We will try to evade the enemy and start a guerilla war against the Alliance if needed, though, at the moment I am not sure what the Admiral commands are."
Lt. Commander Blake takes a pause and then continues his throat a little dry
"It seems very strange that the Alliance sent an SSD vessel to this moon, unless it is very important to them for some reason."

---

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-05-17 02:09:19)

The Moff gives a light sigh, not audible over the radio as he takes another drag and taps a few commands into his datapad and sending the message off, gathering a few more ships and someone far more important.
 "I see…who was in command when the ship surrendered? Do you have any idea how the crew fairs under their new alliance prison keepers? What, pray tell, was the command crew all doing exactly while this turn of events took place?" 
He then considers what he is told and licks his lips a bit.
 "I have few ideas as to why the Alliance would have such interest in the little moon, it was the scene of a great victory for them, but that doesnt feel right as to why they would deploy any significant forces there.."

---

### **zvi** (2012-05-18 10:10:31)

Lt. Commander Blake thought things over before replying to the Moff.
"Well, Sir, All top ranking officers are ok and on the surface of the moon, none of them was on the ship when the attack happened. It was captained by a Lt. which received direct orders from the Admiral as to what to do.
We were all camped near one of the Ewok villages, where the remaining Alliance pilots were. They are all dead except for one who escaped.
We manage to capture 2 X-wings and 2 Y-wings, thou the 2 X-wings are now out of order and I am now speaking to you from one of the Y-wings. When the attack happened I flew over to join my pilots but I was too late. I managed to see the destruction of the Venerator, she…" Lt. Commander Blake pauses as it was hard for him to describe it as it was sad sight to see "…was cut in half by the enemy fire. Sir"
"We managed to load 6 way points from the captured vehicles using their nav computer, one was pointing to a scared place for the Ewoks which also shows some kind of mineral deposits which the rest of the command decided to investigate.
They are en route to that place as we speak. I managed to scan 2 more nav points before darkness fell in. One seemed to be an Ewok major city the other an Ewok village not much different then the one we camped in."
"I have no clue as to how the prisoners are treated under the Alliance capture. Sir"
Lt. Commander Blake rests his back against the pilot seat and closes his eyes for a few min before the Moff's respond will surely come in.

Alvar made his way into the shuttle carefully, making sure that the way was clear before he entered it and turned on the Holo-net tranciever, and made a call to give his report to Moff Kane with his hands behind his back.
"Moff Kane. This is Admiral Alvar of the Adjudicator. This will most likely be the last report given until the re-enforcements arrive, but if we are able to leak any more then we will. Yesterday, the Alliance Commander attacked us with a group of about ninety of her soldiers, through 'Intense' negotiations, I managed to get her to have a full retreat. It seems they are willing to do anything to stop a bombing of these...local's villages. As it also happens, this will no doubt gain some...dissension among one or more of my officers...but it did gain us the Alliance Commander in captivity as well as her datapad, a code cylinder, her comlink, her blaster, a tool-kit, a field kit, and her jumpsuit which we tied her up with. I disposed of her once we got all we needed from her. I would also like to request, to have our pilot...Blake, demoted. During the battle, Blake disobeyed several of our commands to make a second bombing run out of fear of 'personal' safety. It is my understanding that an Imperial is supposed to know no fear. Which is why myself, and my other officers turned to face our enemy...ready to die for our glorious Empire. It would have been risky but that second bombing run could have ended the battle even quicker, and prevented -my- soldiers from dying. It should also be noted that because he was keeping in contact with you, he garnered the alliances attention -again-, causing the attack in the first place. He had been warned of the dangers of communicating, and the possibility that they could be traced on a sub-space radio. the only reason -I- am doing so right now on this is because we will be moving our location within an appropriate time. If he is not to be demoted I request at least some other form of punishment."
He then stands at attention to await the words of the moff.

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-05-20 23:18:59)

Kane would appear to be sitting behind an obsidian desk with a small box at one corner and a glass of liquid nearby, as seemed to be standard for him, though his exact location was impossible to identify as there was no window behind him, simply a massive imperial crest as well as two gleaming bodyguard droids.
 Hello Admiral, I am glad to see you are still in one piece."
He says by way of greeting then steeples his finger, leaning on his desk, staring into the receivor, his eyes seeming to meet Alvar's across the lightyears through the holonet. He then frowns at some of the words and nods.
 "I…see. How do you know this commander would not have revealed any other useful information? Is it possible you gained the information needed by you at the moment but that under more proper supervision she may have given other more useful information to be used against the alliance? Did her code cylinder and datapad reveal anything of interest?" 
He then leans back, picking up a glass of brandy and sipping at it as he continues to listen to the report, stopping mid sip and setting the glass down.
 "Charges of abandoning ones post and ignoring lawful orders are a grave accusation admiral…"
He reminds Alvar.
 "If you wish to have him demoted for his cowardice in the face of the enemy that is your decision as the commanding admiral, it is within your power to adjust your personals pay-grade so far, and if you wish to punish him yourself then so be it, or you may request an official court martial for his actions." 
His voice formal and calm.
 "I need not know where you are planning on relocating to, it would be better if you not tell me in the rare case that this is intercepted or something else unfortunate happens. When reinforcements arrive in system you will know. Is there anything else admiral?"

---

### **Maldoravia** (2012-05-21 10:46:40)

Alvar remained emotionless, but felt a familiar sense in relief that this Moff was possibly one who understood him.
"In the defense of all involved with the Alliance Commander....We did not have any of our interrogation equipment. All we could do was slap her around a bit, and that did not yield anything. She was very closed off, perhaps due to her training, and the locals had already taken notice. To avoid any more confrontation, she had to be killed immediately while they were distracted. As for the code cylinder and datapad...The cylinder was not yet perused, but the datapad is her personal...journal if you will. It stated that Lt Lightus divulged that we were still on the Moon, which is when they started their low orbital period in search for us."
He takes a moment of pause before continuing.
"Other than that Sir, there is nothing else to report."

---

### **Alexander_Kane** (2012-05-21 12:27:28)

"Then why do you fear dissension among your officers for what you did to the alliance officer? If you capture another do not be so hasty in executing them." 
He would move his hand up and rubs his chin slowly considering the words.
 "See what you can do with that code cylinder, but do not transmit the data to me, I will see what you have uncovered soon. I am unfamiliar with a Lt. Lightus, but I am sure you will deal with his betrayal satisfactorily. If there is nothing else, good luck, and stay safe."
