<span style="font-size: 1.00em;">Notes on how to raise crew performance</span> <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Crew performance can be raised by effective leadership roleplaying and persuasion checks to the crew. Effective decision making that saves lives and equipment will boost this as well. A strong rapport between the key officers will inspire the comraderie in the men. If the crew does not have confidence in your leadership, their abilities will begin to drop. Also, officers constantly disagreeing with one another will make them question their leadership.
