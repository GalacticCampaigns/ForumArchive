Here is Master Ristrin's death scene for those who missed it:
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">** (2132) Master Ristrin approached his disciples&#8230;. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin bowed deeply and solemnly. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: You&#39;ve done it
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 hugged both women to him before whispering to them that he was proud of them all, then looked to Master Ristrin and said &quot;Master&#8230;withr espect&#8230;.but if we go anywhere else for training&#8230;.&quot; **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu turned to the master and stills her smile to a frown &quot;You aren&#39;t going to tell us we have more training somewhere are you? I&#39;d like to go to the ball&#8230;&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: No Alvar.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Your training is over.
(2132) Master Ristrin: I have put you through considerable hardship.
(2132) Master Ristrin: And that burden I must carry with me for the rest of my days&#8230;.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle blinks, smiling at Alvar&#8230; then looks up to Ristrin, staring at him in quite some surprise. And evident relief. &quot;&#8230; Oh, thank the bloody-&#8230; some deity that doesn&#39;t exist.&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: Extreme hardship&#8230;
(2132) Master Ristrin: My purpose was not always clear&#8230;but you still followed me.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu nods her head in agreement to her friend and turns back to the master with a frown &quot;Master&#8230;with respect..you&#39;ve never spoken like this before.&quot; **
(2150) Ensign Alvar-637: &quot;I think you will be able to handle that Master&#8230;You got to see us succeed.&quot;
(2132) Master Ristrin: Ever since Yinchorri
(2132) Master Ristrin: With Tenmel and Max&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Horatio&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: You have been my children.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle blinks, frowning for a moment as she watches him. &quot;What happened to Tenmel and Max?&quot; **
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 frowned at the mention of Tenmel and Max&#8230;.he wondered how they were doing&#8230; &quot;You&#8230;have been the closest thing to a Father that I know of Master.&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: They&#39;ve chosen to move away from the settlement.
(2132) Master Ristrin: For reasons I cannot say, their location must remain undisclosed.
(2132) Master Ristrin: As has Issa&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: I let them go&#8230;they did not want the lives you pursued.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu nods her head in agreement &quot;You have been the only thing to a father we&#39;ve ever known, you&#39;ve worked us hard but&#8230;it was to make sure we succeded.&quot; she frowns at the mention of the others **
(2132) Master Ristrin: I&#39;m glad you respect me.
(2132) Master Ristrin: It&#39;s really all I ever devoted my life to.
(2132) Master Ristrin: My life was devoted to you.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 was feeling a surge of an unusual emotion&#8230;and he was not sure whether to hug the man or remain proper&#8230; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: Even if it meant killing you.
** (2132) Master Ristrin took a moment&#8230;.. **
** (2140) Ensign Janelle nods slightly at that, wringing her hands together behind her back. She was suffering the same problem as Alvar, at the moment, beginning to gnaw at her lower lip as she eyes the imposing figure. And to think he used to be her nightmare. **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu twitches faintly before sighing and hugging the man &quot;I still want to hit you master, but I do respect what you&#39;ve done. Thank you..&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: I need to sit down.
(2132) Master Ristrin: I am overcome with emotion.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Children, accompany me.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 moved to his side and held him gently by the shoulders. &quot;You have helped us&#8230;Let us help you, even if it is just to sit down.&quot; **
** (2132) Master Ristrin moves up the stone stair well into the breezy and cool section of the dais. **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu took to his other side to help him to sit. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin reached up to his helmet&#8230;.. **
(2150) Ensign Alvar-637: &quot;You will remain with us&#8230;right? I mean after all&#8230;I still need training&#8230;&quot;
** (2132) Master Ristrin unlocked his helmet&#8230;. **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu blinked in surprise &quot;Master&#8230;?&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: I just need some fresh air
** (2140) Ensign Janelle moves along behind them, since she can&#39;t&#8230; y&#39;know&#8230; actually help any more. Unless she wanted to hold him by his legs. Her eyes widen briefly at the sound of it unclasping, shifting in sudden discomfort. **
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 did not mean to stare, but could not help but find himself fixing his gaze on their master as he was apparently removing his helmet. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin his humanoid face were devoid of eye balls&#8230;.his face was pale gray and wrinkled beyond belief. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: As you can see&#8230;.
** (2132) Master Ristrin his pale mouth moving in almost a disgusting manner&#8230; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: I am blind my children.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle flinches inwardly at the sight of his gnarly features, letting out an almost involuntary gasp, which she quickly silences by biting down once more on her lip. Nope, not gonna&#39; say anything. **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu blinked in surprise, staring at him her mouth open in a quiet horror, her nightmares of him just got worse. &quot;Wh&#8230;what happened to you master?&quot; **
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 again, could not help but stare. It was not with disgust, but with so many questions that now flooded into his head. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: I was trained&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: As you were&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: To continue the tradition&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: and it cost me my sight&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: And now&#8230;the legacy will continue&#8230;.
(2131) Ensign Daiyu: &quot;We&#8230;are to loose our sight too?&quot;
(2132) Master Ristrin: With you&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: No&#8230;.
** (2132) Master Ristrin coughed&#8230;. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: You, my children&#8230;are my eyes&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: I see the galaxy through you.
(2132) Master Ristrin: It may be difficult to understand&#8230;.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 did not understand this now, but was sure he would later. &quot;Master&#8230;I have&#8230;many questions.&quot; **
** (2140) Ensign Janelle frowns in confusion at that. Obviously, he didn&#39;t mean it literally&#8230;. Did he? **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu stared at him as warning bells went off in her head, he&#39;d never taken his helmet off, he was coughing&#8230;&quot;Maybe we should get a medic for you master..&quot; **
** (2132) Master Ristrin &mdash;Admiral Nabross was coming up the stairs&#8230;.&mdash;- **
(2131) Ensign Daiyu: &quot;for that cough..&quot;
(2132) Master Ristrin: Get her away children!
(2132) Master Ristrin: Please&#8230;
(2132) Master Ristrin: No one must interrupt us.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu turned sharply and moved to the admiral to bar her path &quot;Admiral, please. this is private.&quot; **
(2132) Admiral Nabross: Is something the matter Lieutenant?
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 moved to stand next to Daiyu, a polite look in his eyes. &quot;No&#8230;Its just&#8230;a private family moment.&quot; **
(2131) Ensign Daiyu: &quot;Family matter Admiral, this is very personal. With respect I ask you to please let us have this area.&quot;
(2132) Admiral Nabross: Aye, I wish you well&#8230;.
** (2132) Admiral Nabross bowed in Imperial fashion and backed away. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: Thank you&#8230;.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle simply stands quietly to the side of Ristrin, watching the interaction with the same curious frown. Today is a very odd day. **
(2131) Ensign Daiyu: &quot;Thank you Ma&#39;am.&quot; she bows slightly but stands there watching her. She wasn&#39;t going to leave to the master side until she was sure the woman was off the stairs. only then would she return to kneel at the masters side.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 gave a greatful smile and bowed in return, before returning to Ristrin&#8230;.not going to be satisfied until the topmost, two questions were answered. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: I am a happy man&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Considering the darkness I have embraced&#8230;
(2150) Ensign Alvar-637: &quot;Perhaps instead it was the road to a new dawn, instead of darkness.&quot;
(2132) Master Ristrin: I never had the opportunity&#8230;.to have a son&#8230;.or daughter&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: If I had eyes&#8230;.I would cry&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: But my place is in darkness&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Yes&#8230;
(2132) Master Ristrin: Alvar&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: You are wise my student.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu took one of his hands gently in hers, she could feel her eyes watering at this, why did it feel like he was saying goodbye. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin nodded with his disfigured head. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: You can stand to look at me&#8230;.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle blinks, looking down at Daiyu&#39;s hand. She stares for a few long moments, shifting uneasily as she slowly moves to stand behind her, watching Ristrin with quiet concern. She&#39;s remained quiet this whole time, letting the other two talk. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin returned Daiyu&#39;s gesture&#8230; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: As you might have guessed&#8230;
(2132) Master Ristrin: I don&#39;t have much time left.
(2132) Master Ristrin: How much I have&#8230;is uncertain&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Could be five minutes from now&#8230;.or 20 years&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: It is a curse that has wrecked my body.
(2132) Master Ristrin: But it was necessary&#8230;.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu held his hand tightly &quot;Master why now&#8230;we still need you, Alvar has a lot of training he still has to do&#8230;&quot; she says quietly &quot;Why was it necessary?&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: For the wisdom I needed.
(2132) Master Ristrin: To train you.
(2132) Master Ristrin: You&#8230;must not fail.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 shook his head and said while looking into the two empty sockets. He wouldnt hear any of this. &quot;I will not let you leave us&#8230;Not until two of my questions are answered&#8230;&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: While you&#39;re going into the military&#8230;the navy.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Your goal lies far beyond the scope of military, politics, and anything of that scope.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle looks to Alvar, scowling slightly at his words. &quot;Don&#39;t be impatient, Alvar **
(2132) Master Ristrin: No
(2132) Master Ristrin: His passions should not be chastened.
(2132) Master Ristrin: You are wise Daiyu, but he is too.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu nods her head slowly and looks to the hand in hers before something Ten had asked them once came back to her, with all the talk of children&#8230;she glanced up to Alvar. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: You all stand equally.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle blinks, looking back to Ristrin. She decides not to comment on the fact that he can&#39;t seem to seperate the two, though she decides that&#39;s just ar esult of old age and blindness. **
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 turned to Janelle and said &quot;I&#39;m not being impatient! I dont like this any more than you but iif his heart is set on this&#8230;There is nothing we can do to stop it from happening&#8230;.He -taught- us to never stop searching for wisdom or power&#8230;I am merely honouring what his lessons&#8230;&quot; He turns to face Ristrin &quot;-Your- lessons.&quot; **
** (2132) Master Ristrin nods to Alvar&#8230;. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: Right &#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Future, it is always in motion.
(2132) Master Ristrin: But I have foreseen your destinies&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: They are great.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Unfortunately I don&#39;t know if I will get to see my children accomplish that.
** (2132) Master Ristrin held his hand up to **
(2150) Ensign Alvar-637: &quot;If you are to become part of that force thing&#8230;then you will see it.&quot;
** (2132) Master Ristrin Daiyu&#8230;it was shaking visibly&#8230;. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: The Force&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: I know it has been in the back of your minds.
(2132) Master Ristrin: My feelings tell me it is so.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu looked down again &quot;Master&#8230;there&#39;s&#8230;there&#39;s something Ten had asked us once..long ago..with all this talk of children&#8230;Master..do you..know who our parents are? the ones that birthed us?&quot; she pet the hand gently, it wasn&#39;t going to be long..she could feel it. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: I do know.
(2132) Master Ristrin: But I cannot tell you.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Not yet&#8230;.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 blinks&#8230;that had been one of his questions, but as it appears, there was now a third one. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: If I perish beforehand&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: You will find your way.
(2131) Ensign Daiyu: &quot;Master I feel if you don&#39;t tell us now you won&#39;t have the chance..&quot;
(2132) Master Ristrin: You are capable.
(2132) Master Ristrin: I&#8230;.
** (2132) Master Ristrin fell back into the shrubbery of the stone floor&#8230; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: This pain&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: It&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: strengthens me&#8230;.
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu stared at him, his hand still in hers before she moved to check his pluse **
(2132) Master Ristrin: Alvar&#8230;.
** (2132) Master Ristrin coughing and wheezing&#8230;. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: You are strong&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: But you&#39;re friends are just as strong.
(2132) Master Ristrin: Dont fail them Alvar&#8230;.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 blinked before placing an arm underneath him. &quot;I promise you, I will not.&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: A true great person will not&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: I&#39;m trying forgive me&#8230;to find the words&#8230;.
** (2140) Ensign Janelle blinks, looking down to Daiyu at that. Admittedly, that had been something that kept her awake sometimes&#8230; Her musing is interupted as Ristrin falls, her eyes widening in alarm as she steps forward, watching him with evident concern. She goes to kneel beside him, gnawing at her lip as she looks him over, wringing her hands atop her knee. She hates being useless. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin moved his hands across his eye slots rubbing them&#8230;. **
(2131) Ensign Daiyu: &quot;Take your time Master&#8230;&quot;
(2132) Master Ristrin: I can still see through you&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: It is amazing&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: My power&#8230;..
(2132) Master Ristrin: Alvar&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: You must inspire greatness in others&#8230;.or your greatness means nothing.
** (2132) Master Ristrin reached his hand around **
** (2132) Master Ristrin Alvars neck bringing him in closer&#8230;. **
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 felt a tear run down his cheek as he listened. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: Take this&#8230;.
** (2132) Master Ristrin reached into his pocket&#8230;. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin pulled out a pyramdicial shaped object, pulsating red energy emanating from it&#8230;. **
(2132) Master Ristrin: You will find how to use this.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 gazed at the object before taking it in hand and looks it over withw onder. &quot;What is it&#8230;&quot; **
(2132) Master Ristrin: Daiyu&#8230;.
(2132) Master Ristrin: You&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.
** (2132) Master Ristrin hands grew stiff around Alvar&#8230;. **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu turns to him, tears falling though she didn&#39;t want them to &quot;Master&#8230;&quot; she says softly, holding his hand again tightly **
(2132) Master Ristrin: &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 winced but grew somewhat frantic. &quot;Somebody do something!&quot; He then held their master close and breathed slowly to calm himself. &quot;Dont do this&#8230;Please&#8230;D&#8230;Daiyu needs to hear what you have to say&#8230;So does Janelle&#8230;.&quot; **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu shook his hand gently, tears falling more before she checked his pulse &quot;Master! master come back!&quot; **
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 would quickly start trying to give cpr if he couldnt hear or feel breathing. **
** (2140) Ensign Janelle leans back as she watches, gulping softly. Shethen shifts to the side, beginning to muble quietly to herself as she focuses back on him. **
** (2132) GM Dreamwalker &mdash;Alvar gets on top of Master Ristrin&#39;s body and attempts CPR&#8230;&mdash;- **
** (2132) GM Dreamwalker &mdash;The other two check his pulse and rise and fall of his chest&#8230;.Daiyu thinks her best option is to call for help&#8230;.&mdash; **
** (2132) GM Dreamwalker &mdash;There was no pulse or rise and fall of the chest&#8230;.&mdash; **
(2131) Ensign Daiyu: &quot;Janelle get help!&quot; she tells her &quot;Qucik!&quot;
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 checks to see if anything is blocking the airway rthat would keep the breaths from going in. **
** (2140) Ensign Janelle looks to her, nodding as she hurriedly rises to her feet, turning and running off. &quot;Uhm-&#8230; Right, yeah-&#8230;&quot; And with that, she scurries back down the stairs, heading for the closest&#8230; you know&#8230; helpful people. **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu shifts to her knees to cross her hands over his heart and push to get the heart started **
** (2132) Master Ristrin &mdash;Alvar observes as his body starting shrinking very quickly&#8230;. **
(2140) Ensign Janelle: [[ Do I need to roll anything to find people?
** (2132) Master Ristrin &#39;s body vanishes from sight. **
** (2132) Master Ristrin leaving only his robes in a heap. **
** (2131) Ensign Daiyu stares wide eyed at the empty place, tears still falling as she shakily touches the robe &quot;N&#8230;no..wh&#8230;master?? wh..where&#39;d he go!?&quot; **
** (2150) Ensign Alvar-637 quickly notices this and looks around, very very confused now and can only wonder what Janelle will think whens he comes back just to find his clothes&#8230; &quot;I&#8230;Master?!&quot; He then quickly stashes the glowy pyramid. *</span>

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-01 22:50:15)

Here is the hostage situation from Session 12:
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">** (119) Admiral Alvar looks to the small Ewok and asks in question &quot;Lunariss?&quot; He made it sound like he was asking where the Ewok is or was. **
** (115) Ewok shrugged&#8230; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Toshee&#8230;?&quot;
(115) Ewok: ((persuasion alvar))
(119) Admiral Alvar: [1d20+18] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [12,18] = (30)
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok tugged at the admiral. **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok pointed to the tree huts. **
** (119) Admiral Alvar turned to the light Ewok with a smile, before looking in the direction before nodding in a thank you. &quot;Terseht&#8230;tell this wonderful Ewok thank you for me.&quot; He then moves off in the direction, signaling Daiyu to follow. **
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;Too kan&quot;
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok waves at Terseht **
(115) Light tan furred Ewok: Yaka me
** (117) Captain Daiyu moved through the bodies to follow after him, jogging a moment to catch up to him. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle just looks extraordinarily awkward, surrounded as she is by ewoks. So instead, she just follows along behind Alvar and Daiyu, not willing to be left behind with the crazy furballs. **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok guides you to a wooden lift, through the chaotic sprawl of Ewoks for food and magic items. **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok waits for all the other champions to get on board. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;None of them knew where their Wiseman was&#8230;but they know where the pilot is&#8230;&quot; he said while showing them on the way. &quot;I can at least get her to say whether it was indeed the Alliance who attacked us&#8230;that much we -need- to know&#8230;maybe she even knows where Lunariss is.&quot;
(115) Light tan furred Ewok: ((Your chronos read 1030))
** (117) Captain Daiyu nods her head in agreement, carefully to not put her pet out of sorts. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle grimaces at that, shaking her head with a quiet sigh. &quot;Be sure not to engage in hostilities, then.&quot; **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok once everyone is on board, the wooden lift shakes awkwardly as it descends upwardly&#8230;. **
** (119) Admiral Alvar shook his head &quot;Nothing but peace this time, I promise.&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Best to keep that one.&quot;
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok leads you across the wooden planks to a hut that was flanked by unlit torches&#8230;.he moved asside a collection of small animal skull beads&#8230;to reveal a wooden cot with a woman laying beneath a fur blanket. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;&#8230; We abandoned the lieutenant.&quot;
** (115) Female Pilot was sleeping. **
(208) Lt. Terseht: (( which lieutenant? ))
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;No we didnt, he has plenty of new friends bplus two droids.&quot;
** (117) Captain Daiyu looked up to the admiral &quot;Do you plan to handle this or let the women folk take a turn? **
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( You, I thought. ))
(208) Lt. Terseht: (( still here ))
** (115) Female pilot rolled over in her fur blanket. **
** (119) Admiral Alvar looked to Daiyu for a moment before saying &quot;You two, if you would not mind. But I have just three questions that -must- be asked.&quot; **
** (117) Captain Daiyu nods her head &quot;you can ask them, just let us attempt to get on good terms.&quot; She moves into the room, motioning Jan to follow her. once in she kneels down, out of arms length &quot;Miss.&quot; **
** (115) Tan fur Ewok looked at the officers. **
** (115) Female pilot wakes up&#8230;. **
** (115) Female pilot sits up&#8230;. **
(115) Female pilot: What?!
(208) Lt. Terseht: (( So I don&#39;t have to leave? ))
(115) Female pilot: Who are you?!
** (119) Admiral Alvar hung back away from her sleeping, and remained silent for now but watched intently. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle heaves a quiet sigh as she steps up behind Daiyu, looking down at the woman. &quot;&#8230; Hello.&quot; **
** (115) Female pilot reaches underneath her blanket. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu holds her hands up &quot;Unarmed, calm down please. We mean no harm to you or them, we simply wish to talk.&quot; **
(115) Female pilot: Why are you armed?
** (115) Female pilot looks to Janelle and Alvar. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu glanced to jan and sighs &quot;Forgot about those..&quot; she mutters &quot;We came through the wood, it&#39;d be stupid to be completely unarmed there.&quot; **
** (119) Admiral Alvar because we were attacked by someone a few days ago and we like to be prepared. **
** (115) Female pilot sat up on her cot. **
(115) Female pilot: Get back
(115) Female pilot: All of you.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;But also because we came through the woods&#8230;&quot; He was already backed as far as he could be.
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighed and glanced to alvar &quot;you said you&#39;d stay out of this, so stay out of it.&quot; she sighs and looks to the woman &quot;Men. honestly, they can&#39;t take direction well.&quot; **
** (333) Commodore Janelle tilts her head to the side at that, frowning slightly as she looks down at the woman. &quot;&#8230; Well, the logical reason would be that we&#39;re on an unexplored world with thousands of dangerous creatures roaming the undergrowth.&quot; **
(115) Female pilot: What are you doing here?
** (119) Admiral Alvar would have pointed out he didnt have to take -any- direction from her but kept silent. **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;We&#39;re here to offer gifts to the little friends here, and find something important to us. that&#39;s all. We came up here, to make sure you were alright.&quot;
(115) Female pilot: You are civilians?
(115) Female pilot: Scholars?
(115) Female pilot: What?
(115) Female pilot: Spacers?
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighed &quot;Will you agree to be civil and put the weapon away first?&quot; **
(115) Female pilot: ((her weapon is away.))
(117) Captain Daiyu: (last we saw she had a hand on something)
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;If you could remain as you are miss, you will find us most agreeable. We only wish to speak&quot;
(115) Female pilot: Speak then.
** (115) Female pilot kept her hand close to her holster&#8230;. **
** (115) Female pilot notices Terseht has two pistols. **
(115) Female pilot: You seem very well armed.
(115) Female pilot: Those aren&#39;t hunting weapons.
** (117) Captain Daiyu nods her head &quot;We are military..just as you are. The faction is&#8230;not on the same terms but, we don&#39;t mean you harm&#8230;&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;So do you&#8230;since when do sick people have hidden weapons?&quot;
(115) Female pilot: I have one pistol.
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;m a pilot.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;More than I have at the moment&#8230;&quot;
(115) Female pilot: And which military are you with?
(115) Female pilot: But your friends
(115) Female pilot: Are well armed.
(115) Female pilot: Especially that man&#8230;
** (115) Female pilot points to Terseht. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu shakes her head &quot;I can&#39;t speak more on it until I know you won&#39;t fire that.&quot; she smiles faintly. and motions to the door &quot;Ters, would you mind leaving the hut please. Jan, step back a bit?&quot; **
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;We are only well armed to combat the many dangers of the planet. As you know Endor is host to variety of deadly creatures&quot;
(115) Female pilot: I won&#39;t use my weapon&#8230;.
(115) Female pilot: But I&#39;m leaving&#8230;
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;Perhaps if I merely took the power packs out of my weapons that would satiate your desire for equal terms?&quot;
** (115) Female pilot watches the group warily. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu stands and holds her hands out &quot;Wait. please. we need to know something and you are the only one to answer it.&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Or if the lady prefers&#8230;.she could speak to the only unarmed person here&#8230;&quot; He then shook his head &quot;I just have a few questions then you can leave.&quot;
(115) Female pilot: What the hell is this?
** (115) Female pilot stepped down from her cot. **
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;m leaving.
** (333) Commodore Janelle heaves a quiet sigh, taking a step back as watches the woman silently. **
(115) Female pilot: Please let me through.
** (119) Admiral Alvar took a step back away as well. More than one way to skin a cat. **
(115) Female pilot: ((You notice a very crude bandage around her left arm))
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Come on, let the lady leave.&quot;
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighed &quot;Who ordered the attack on the landing pad a few days ago.&quot; **
** (208) Lt. Terseht steps away with a large sidestep **
(117) Captain Daiyu: (this would go so much better if people listened. not you jan.)
(115) Female pilot: What are you talking about?
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;m leaving.
(119) Admiral Alvar: (listened how? You had a chance now shes leaving&#8230;Hes stepping in.)
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( I am most amazing person ever. ))
(117) Captain Daiyu: (chance what chance?! he undermined her and spoke up and didn&#39;t listen to shit!)
** (115) Female pilot walked through the entry way of the hut&#8230;.. **
(117) Captain Daiyu: (and not just him)
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Not with a bandage like that&#8230;.We can fix that for you.&quot;
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;How&#39;s your arm.&quot;
** (115) Female pilot turned smoothly to not keep her back at you&#8230;. **
(115) Female pilot: No, I&#39;m ok&#8230;
** (115) Female pilot began backpedaling to the nearest lift&#8230;. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;You sure? Looks like a mediocre job.&quot;
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;ll find aid elsewhere&#8230;.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;If you think you can leave then fine, but you will miss the celebration&#8230;&quot;

(115) Female pilot: ((One second))
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head with a roll of her eyes, turning around to watch them all with a disapproving frown. **
(115) Female pilot: No&#8230;
(115) Female pilot: That&#39;s ok.
** (115) Female pilot began rotating the crank to the wooden lift&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu throws her hands in the air, crossing them again, while she suppressed the urge to kick the bed. turning to Janelle she shakes her head as well. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: ((How the hell did a 34 lose&#8230;? Her will should be lower than that being alone.)
(115) Female pilot: ((-10 on your check))
(119) Admiral Alvar: (Why?)
(115) Female pilot: ((Hostile))
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( we&#39;re all wearing Imperial Grey, I do believe.))
(117) Captain Daiyu: (not me. but doesn&#39;t seem to matter.)
(115) Female pilot: ((Yea most of you are wearing imp uniforms))
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;perhaps you might stay so we could merely exchange information. if you feel that we are too numerous we can lower the numbers to your suit, but I would very much like to continue this conversation&quot; [1d20+17] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [18,17] = (35) persuasion
** (115) Female pilot looks at Terseht as the lift gets to the top&#8230;. **
(115) Female pilot: No&#8230;
** (119) Admiral Alvar got his comlink ready, seeing as he was still in the hut room and she was outside. **
(115) Female pilot: That won&#39;t be necessary.
** (115) Female pilot got on the lift. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu moved to the lift &quot;Look all we want is to talk. you&#39;re free to go, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to arrest you or anything, but we do want some answers and right now you&#39;re all we have.&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Pilot is about to try and leave. Have someone ready to intercept, but out of sight&#8230;.and silently.&quot;
(117) Captain Daiyu: [1d20+11] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [5,11] = (16)
(117) Captain Daiyu: (yea that failed miserably)
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;-Yes sir, we have eyes on the village&mdash;-
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;We won&#39;t let her leave&mdash;-
** (115) Female pilot lowered herself down about 13 feet to the forest floor. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;No Ewok targets. Understood? Just the pilot. Set to stun.&ndash;
** (333) Commodore Janelle takes a step back inside as well, raising her com as well to speak softly into it. &quot;Be sure to incapacitate her, not kill. Wounded shoulder, single blaster. She&#39;s likely heading to her starship.&quot; **
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( starship, starfighter. same thing))
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;We have to be within 9 meters for stun range&mdash;
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;I assure you the exchange would be quite beneficial for both parties. Should you accept we have no qualms of letting you go on your way&quot;
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;We&#39;d have to occupy the village&mdash;
** (115) Female Pilot was walking to the opposite end of hte village. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu watched her go silently, then set out after her, cranking the ramp back up as fast as she could, hopping on and heading down after her. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle lowers her com with a bemused little snort, shaking her head and sighing quietly. &quot;Yes, the greatest minds of the Empire, indeed.&quot; She&#39;s fond of sarcasm, following along after Daiyu. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Then just do what you can before this gets into the village. Go around, intercept her, and quickly.&ndash; ((Alvar had stated on numerous occassions that the troopers should -surround- the boundary line.
(115) Female Pilot: &ndash;They are surrounding&mdash;-
** (115) &mdash;How many men do you need?&mdash; . **
** (117) Captain Daiyu took off at a run for the woman &quot;Wait! please! ancesters would you stop a moment! what have you got against talking to us??&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: You&#39;re imperials!
(115) Female Pilot: Leave me be&#8230;.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Daiyu, break off. Do not create a scene.&ndash;
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;And you&#39;re republic and we haven&#39;t shot at you! so there&#39;s got to be something here! let us try a peaceful conversation we were doing well before the boys got in on it!&quot;
(115) Female Pilot: I don&#39;t know why you have spared me!
(115) Female Pilot: But I&#39;m not gonna stick around to think about it!
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;Atleast she&#39;s not blind.&quot; She idly muses on that as she follows along at a slow pace, hm&#39;ing softly.
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Sir how many men do you need in the village?&mdash; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;You don&#39;t deserve to die! there&#39;s no reason for it!&quot; she runs a bit more and grabs on to her arm.
** (115) Female Pilot faces the Captain **
(115) Female Pilot: What the? Your face?!
(115) Female Pilot: Serves you right Imperial!
(119) Admiral Alvar: &mdash;Three at the most Captain. Do not create a scene. Give Captain Daiyu a few more chances but once she crosses that boundary line&#8230;move in. Do -NOT- kill.&ndash;
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;Roger Sir, they are double timing to your position!&mdash;
** (117) Captain Daiyu feels her head sharply, and looks away &quot;how does it serve me right?&quot; she asks, &quot;answer me that. how does this serve me right?&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: I&#39;m obviously at your mercy&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: Please let me go.
(115) Female Pilot: I&#39;ve lost everything
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;No.I want to know why this happened to me. I was standing there. that&#39;s all I was doing. standing there when those bombs hit. we hadn&#39;t done anything and this happened. why. tell em that.&quot;
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Again, Daiyu. Do -not- create a scene! If these Ewok&#39;s get upset over this then it&#39;s all over for us.&ndash; &ndash;Captain, hold once you get into position. Captain Daiyu might be getting somewhere.&mdash;
(115) Female Pilot: Let me go&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: We are at war.
(115) Female Pilot: And that was battle.
(115) Female Pilot: There doesn&#39;t need to be any more casualties.
(115) Female Pilot: Let me go please.
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head with a quiet sigh as she steps up behind Daiyu, watching the woman curiously. &quot;If you come with us, you will be given safe passage to return home, once you&#39;ve answered a few questions. We can&#39;t gurantee your safety otherwise, I&#39;m afraid.&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Tell me why pilot! WE were here for a mission that was NOT for battle.!&quot;
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( am i meant to be rolling stuff for that i forget

(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;Yes, we understand your pain-addled brain is mildly paranoid and lacking in the intelligent thought proces sdepartment.&quot; She obviously didn&#39;t remember anything from books&#8230; she just felt compelled to be very snarky.
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( Janelle is still like four feet away, right? :P ))
(115) Female Pilot: ((Yes))
** (115) Female Pilot kept the barrel in Daiyu&#39;s face. **
(115) Female Pilot: Follow my commands and I wont shoot you.
(115) Female Pilot: No more bloodshed&#8230;understood?
(115) Female Pilot: ((Daiyu you can still act))
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighs faintly &quot;you know..this all would have been avoided if you had just talked to us right? and if you hadn&#39;t done this I was going to take you to your ship, against an order.&quot; she says slowly &quot;And now you&#39;re&#8230;what? goign to shoot me? hipocrite. I haven&#39;t fired a gun once. I haven&#39;t targted anyone and look at you. Which of us is the better person here.&quot; **
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;The men are in position sir&mdash;- **
(115) Female Pilot: And be at your mercy?
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;You shoot her and you get shot in return. Sixty Imperial stormtroopers and you choose to threaten the diplomat, miss Pilot. I suspect the general not too far away would have been a better choice.&quot;
(117) Captain Daiyu: (really.)
(115) Female Pilot: I dont think so&#8230;.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Do nothing. Hostage situation.&ndash;
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;What mercy. We ask you questions, you answer, we fix your arm, you go home happy.&quot;
(208) Lt. Terseht: (( That makes two of us :P ))
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;You. miss. are the hipocrite. you are the one that brings on the blood, I&#39;ve done nothing but try to talk to you.&quot;
(115) Female Pilot: Now turn around Imperial&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: Or I shoot you in the head.
** (117) Captain Daiyu turns with a frown &quot;I&#39;m not even armed. I thought the republic had honor..&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;For God&#39;s sake Daiyu do what she says.&ndash;
(115) Female Pilot: Now!
(115) Female Pilot: Hands up!
(117) Captain Daiyu: (she just did turn.)
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighs and puts her hands up slightly &quot;This proves what? that you&#39;re the better woman here?&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: Hands up I said!!!
** (115) Female Pilot quickly puts Daiyu in a choke hold with no pressure and holds the blaster to her head. **
(115) Female Pilot: Now&#8230;
(115) Female Pilot: Walk backwards with me.
(115) Female Pilot: At my command&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: If any of your troops make a false move, you die.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Troopers, allow her to pass.&ndash;
** (333) Commodore Janelle takes a step forwards almost instinctively, her eyes narrowed as a little growl rumbles from her throat. **
(115) Female Pilot: STAY BACK!
** (115) Female Pilot digs the barrel into Daiyu&#39;s head&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighs again and walks when she says &quot;You know this only looks bad for you right? that you&#39;re one in many? that I would have taken you to the ship? that you would have gone home with nothing on your hands? why do this?&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: SHUT UP!
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Janelle&#8230;.Let&#39;s just remain calm&#8230;.Okay&#8230;?&ndash;
(115) Female Pilot: Now&#8230;step backward with me to my ship.
** (117) Captain Daiyu walks with her &quot;tell me&#8230;what are you trying to prove?&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: Be quiet.
(115) Female Pilot: We&#39;re not friends, so shut up.
(333) Commodore Janelle: -There is a certain point at when I am not willing to remain calm when there is a delirious woman holding a blaster to a very close friend&#39;s head.- Her eyes are narrowed in a glare, clearly wanting very much to do&#8230; something.
** (115) Female Pilot walks and steers her hostage toward her starfighter. **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;I never said we were, it&#39;d be nice to be though, I don&#39;t have many really, do you?&quot;
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Doing something could result in her death Janelle&#8230;be easy&#8230;&ndash;
(115) Female Pilot: Imperial Commander&#8230;..
(115) Female Pilot: Call off your men!
(115) Female Pilot: Away from my ship&#8230;.
** (119) Admiral Alvar calls out &quot;AI already gave them the order to allow you to pass!&quot; &ndash;Captain&#8230;move them away from the ship.&ndash; **
** (115) Female Pilot gets about 20 feet from the X-wing&#8230;. **
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Sir are you sure?!&mdash; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Do you not see Daiyu as a hostage? Do it, now!&ndash;
(333) Commodore Janelle: -And if she decides to try and take her with her into the starfighter? Once she does that, it&#39;ll be impossible to retrieve her.&quot;
** (117) Captain Daiyu continues with her &quot;this really wasn&#39;t your best way you know..you didn&#39;t want anymore pain and bloodshed did you? neither do I. but you&#39;re not setting a great example you know.&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: Imperial Commander!
(115) Female Pilot: Listen to my next instruction.
** (115) . Daiyu noticed that her Muynip had flown away. **
(115) Female Pilot: Bring an unarmed man to power up my vehicle.
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighs faintly &quot;You scared my little friend away you know&#8230;&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;I liked him..&quot;
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;I can do that myself if you wish&#8230;I am unarmed.&quot;
** (115) Female Pilot steers Daiyu 20 feet to the side of the X wing. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head with a quiet sigh, reaching down to simply unclip her belt, letting her blaster and holster fall to the ground. &quot;-You don&#39;t even know how to work the damn thing.-&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;I can do it too, you&#39;ll have to let me go, but I can do it.&quot;
(115) Female Pilot: There are other ships!
(115) Female Pilot: So if you try to fly it away, she dies!
(115) Female Pilot: You think I&#39;m stupid to let you go?
(115) Female Pilot: Commander! Power up my X wing!
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;No, I think you&#39;re scared, in a situation you never thought you&#39;d be in, and now..you just want to go home.&quot;
** (119) Admiral Alvar starts to move to do as the crazy lady asked. &quot;It might take me a few moments but I am on my way.&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: I am leaving.
(115) Female Pilot: Now shut up&#8230;.
** (333) Commodore Janelle mutters quietly under her breath as she moves forward, hands raised to show the fact that she&#39;s now actually&#8230;y &#39;know, weaponless. She likes starfighters. &quot;-Admiral, please remain there. You&#39;re a bit safer at the moment.&quot; **
** (119) Admiral Alvar started moving towards the x-wing&#8230;hand sin the air. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( Because Janelle actually knows how they work! Hah. ))
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;do you feel good about yourself though&#8230;at the end of the day..will you sleep well at night because you did this?&quot;
** (119) Admiral Alvar stopped moving -Janelle&#8230;Go ahead and do it.&ndash; **
(115) Female Pilot: Be quiet.
** (333) Commodore Janelle moves forwards&#8230; as, well, she was doing already, her eyes narrowed as she goes to pass the two. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Daiyu, listen to me for once. Shut. Up. You are no good to me or anyone here with a hole in your head.&ndash;
** (115) Female Pilot moved to the opposite flank of Janelle&#8230;. **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Hit a nerve huh? I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep. I&#39;d have nightmares I think..&quot;
(115) Female Pilot: There&#39;s a ladder on the left side of the cockpit&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: Climb up and go inside!
** (119) Admiral Alvar moves off towards the huts again&#8230;slowly, hands in the air. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;I&#39;m well aware.&quot; She goes to clamber inside the cockpit, turning just far enough to check and make sure that there&#39;s not two seats or anything of the sort.
(115) Female Pilot: There are four green switches right underneath the sensor display&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: Push them.
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( are there two seats? :P ))
(115) Female Pilot: ((no))
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( Just making sure!))
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Captain&#8230;?&ndash;
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Yes sir?&mdash;- **
** (333) Commodore Janelle reaches out to flick the switches requested, hmph&#39;ing softly as she restrains the urge to roll her eyes, along with the desire to do a great deal many more things. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighs faintly &quot;You know..for what it&#39;s worth. I hope you have a good and safe flight home.&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: ? I am guessing that he is out of range of cvourse for her to here since he ais at the huts?)
(115) Female pilot: Now there is a yellow cord, next to front right corner of the dashboard&#8230;.unattach that, and plug it into the left side rectangular port.
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( No, she just can&#39;t really tlak over the comms, cans ee? :P ))
** (333) Commodore Janelle does as requested yet again, her boot beginning to tap a bit impatiently at her ordering. **
(115) Female pilot: Shut up hostage.
(119) Admiral Alvar: (Not Janelle&#8230;.Im talking bout the female pilot))
** (115) . The X wing powers to life&#8230;.. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: ( Oh. ))
(115) Female Pilot: Now get out of the cockpit.
(119) Admiral Alvar: (dw. Is the FP out of range to hear Alvar on the comms))
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Simply wishing you well. my name is Daiyu, by the way. you should know if you shoot me.&quot;
** (333) Commodore Janelle clambers out, as requested! As she hops to the ground, she focuses her glare on the woman, shaking her head with a resigned sigh. **
(115) Female Pilot: You will not be shot, so long as your friends comply.
(115) Female Pilot: Now step back to your commander&#8230;.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Are -they- in position&#8230;? Can you see clearly&#8230;?&ndash; (Translates into Are the snipers ready, do they have a clear shot
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;They will, because we&#39;re friends. and they would have let you go too.&quot;
** (333) Commodore Janelle mutters quietly as she moves back around the X-wing, stepping towards the village. If looks could kill! **
** (115) Female Pilot takes Daiyu around the front of the X wing, wanting to avoid the jet wash. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu follows around &quot;What&#39;s your name.&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: Quiet.
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Simple question.&quot;
** (119) Admiral Alvar waited nervously. If this went wrong&#8230;He didnt want to think about that. As far as he knew, Alliance personell were very&#8230;honour bound. **
** (115) Female Pilot awkwardly climbed up the ladder, while maintaining her grip for as long as she could&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu moved with her to make it easier &quot;I forgive you for this. illogical though it was.&quot; **
** (115) Female Pilot holds the the barrel over the top part of her skull. **
** (115) Female Pilot breaks the hold and dives into the cockpit after climbing up&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu rushes down the ladder and breaks for the trees. **
(115) Female Pilot: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [15,12] = (27)
(119) Admiral Alvar: -Fire!-
(115) Female Pilot: [3d8+16] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [2,1,5,16] = (24)
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Either disable the damned ship or kill her dead.&ndash;
** (115) Female Pilot the shot nails hits her X wing as she crawls into the cockpit&#8230;. **
** (115) Female Pilot the cockpit begins to seal. **
(115) Female Pilot: [1d20+16] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [6,16] = (22)
** (333) Commodore Janelle scowls slightly as that, dodging away as she scurries for cover. &quot;-Admiral, she is in a bloody starfighter! You&#39;re not going to bring her down with blasters.- **
** (115) X-Wing rises up&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu brings the com up &quot;-let her go&#8230;just let her g-&quot; **
** (115) X-Wing thrusts forward. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Comms the troopers- Order the Destroyer top take her out.
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Yes sir!&mdash; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;-let her go dammit! just let her go!-&quot;
** (115) . The sound of the X wing departing had attracted all the ewoks to the other side of the village&#8230;. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Wait till she is in space.&ndash;
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Yes sir!&mdash; **
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head as she moves over to Daiyu, murmuring softly as she steps over to her. &quot;You are unharmed, I presume? The Admiral is not going to listen to reason where you are involved, Daiyu.&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;-what part of let her do you people not understand!-
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Orders relayed, The Venerator and Adjudicator are moving to blockade&#8230;.&mdash; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Unless the Tractor Beam can get her&#8230;.&ndash;
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;&#8230; Especially when there are viable tactical concerns involved in such.&quot; She frowns heavily as she looks up to the stars, sighing quietly.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;That would be the best but if not, shoot to kill.&ndash;
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;-Alvar! let her go!-&quot;
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;They are scanning for the X-Wing now sir&#8230;.&mdash;- **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Not this time Daiyu. She gets away she tells her freinds and people about us here. I will not have that happen, not again.&ndash;
** (117) Captain Daiyu glanced up to Janelle, it was slowly sinking in what had just happened, her body was shaking even while one hand was tryig to keep her hair covering her left side &quot;-She wasn&#39;t going to hurt me. She was scared, let her go.-&quot; **
** (333) Commodore Janelle looks back to Daiyu, watching her for a few long moments before stepping closer, reaching out to place one hopefully reassuring hand against her arm. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;You think I wasnt scared?! I almost lost one of my best Officers and someone I care for. I will -not- let her go!&ndash;
** (115) White furred ewok walked over to Daiyu and patted her consolingly. **
** (115) White furred ewok was her friend from before. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu darts back away from her, like some frightened animal, even tripping over herself to fall back, shaking like a leaf &quot;-let her go. please.-&quot; **
** (115) White furred ewok &mdash;Both ships report no sign of the X-Wing&mdash;- **
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;She should of been in orbit by now&mdash;
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;We are Imperials Daiyu. We&ndash; He curses for a moment before saying &ndash;You got your wish, the ships lost track of her.&ndash; &ndash;Keep searching. Scan the planet if you have to.&ndash;
** (333) Commodore Janelle flinches away at that, staring at her a few long moments before she simply goes quiet, watching in silence. Like that odd little lady who always tries to help yet fails miserably every time. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu dropped the comlink and curled into herself, shaking and rocking. Even knowing she wouldn&#39;t have fired, she&#39;d never been in that situation before. **
** (115) . Your chronos read 1117 **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Someone get a stretcher for Captain Daiyu, find her a hut that is unoccupied to rest in.&ndash;</span>

### **Dreamwalker** (2012-05-01 22:50:47)

Here is the hostage situation from Session 12:
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">** (119) Admiral Alvar looks to the small Ewok and asks in question &quot;Lunariss?&quot; He made it sound like he was asking where the Ewok is or was. **
** (115) Ewok shrugged&#8230; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Toshee&#8230;?&quot; <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Translated from Ewokese: Where is the Pilot?

</details>

(115) Ewok: ((persuasion alvar))
(119) Admiral Alvar: [1d20+18] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [12,18] = (30)
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok tugged at the admiral. **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok pointed to the tree huts. **
** (119) Admiral Alvar turned to the light Ewok with a smile, before looking in the direction before nodding in a thank you. &quot;Terseht&#8230;tell this wonderful Ewok thank you for me.&quot; He then moves off in the direction, signaling Daiyu to follow. **
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;Too kan&quot;
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok waves at Terseht **
(115) Light tan furred Ewok: Yaka me
** (117) Captain Daiyu moved through the bodies to follow after him, jogging a moment to catch up to him. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle just looks extraordinarily awkward, surrounded as she is by ewoks. So instead, she just follows along behind Alvar and Daiyu, not willing to be left behind with the crazy furballs. **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok guides you to a wooden lift, through the chaotic sprawl of Ewoks for food and magic items. **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok waits for all the other champions to get on board. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;None of them knew where their Wiseman was&#8230;but they know where the pilot is&#8230;&quot; he said while showing them on the way. &quot;I can at least get her to say whether it was indeed the Alliance who attacked us&#8230;that much we -need- to know&#8230;maybe she even knows where Lunariss is.&quot;
(115) Light tan furred Ewok: ((Your chronos read 1030))
** (117) Captain Daiyu nods her head in agreement, carefully to not put her pet out of sorts. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle grimaces at that, shaking her head with a quiet sigh. &quot;Be sure not to engage in hostilities, then.&quot; **
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok once everyone is on board, the wooden lift shakes awkwardly as it descends upwardly&#8230;. **
** (119) Admiral Alvar shook his head &quot;Nothing but peace this time, I promise.&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Best to keep that one.&quot;
** (115) Light tan furred Ewok leads you across the wooden planks to a hut that was flanked by unlit torches&#8230;.he moved asside a collection of small animal skull beads&#8230;to reveal a wooden cot with a woman laying beneath a fur blanket. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;&#8230; We abandoned the lieutenant.&quot;
** (115) Female Pilot was sleeping. **
(208) Lt. Terseht: (( which lieutenant? ))
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;No we didnt, he has plenty of new friends bplus two droids.&quot;
** (117) Captain Daiyu looked up to the admiral &quot;Do you plan to handle this or let the women folk take a turn? **
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( You, I thought. ))
(208) Lt. Terseht: (( still here ))
** (115) Female pilot rolled over in her fur blanket. **
** (119) Admiral Alvar looked to Daiyu for a moment before saying &quot;You two, if you would not mind. But I have just three questions that -must- be asked.&quot; **
** (117) Captain Daiyu nods her head &quot;you can ask them, just let us attempt to get on good terms.&quot; She moves into the room, motioning Jan to follow her. once in she kneels down, out of arms length &quot;Miss.&quot; **
** (115) Tan fur Ewok looked at the officers. **
** (115) Female pilot wakes up&#8230;. **
** (115) Female pilot sits up&#8230;. **
(115) Female pilot: What?!
(208) Lt. Terseht: (( So I don&#39;t have to leave? ))
(115) Female pilot: Who are you?!
** (119) Admiral Alvar hung back away from her sleeping, and remained silent for now but watched intently. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle heaves a quiet sigh as she steps up behind Daiyu, looking down at the woman. &quot;&#8230; Hello.&quot; **
** (115) Female pilot reaches underneath her blanket. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu holds her hands up &quot;Unarmed, calm down please. We mean no harm to you or them, we simply wish to talk.&quot; **
(115) Female pilot: Why are you armed?
** (115) Female pilot looks to Janelle and Alvar. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu glanced to jan and sighs &quot;Forgot about those..&quot; she mutters &quot;We came through the wood, it&#39;d be stupid to be completely unarmed there.&quot; **
** (119) Admiral Alvar because we were attacked by someone a few days ago and we like to be prepared. **
** (115) Female pilot sat up on her cot. **
(115) Female pilot: Get back
(115) Female pilot: All of you.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;But also because we came through the woods&#8230;&quot; He was already backed as far as he could be.
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighed and glanced to alvar &quot;you said you&#39;d stay out of this, so stay out of it.&quot; she sighs and looks to the woman &quot;Men. honestly, they can&#39;t take direction well.&quot; **
** (333) Commodore Janelle tilts her head to the side at that, frowning slightly as she looks down at the woman. &quot;&#8230; Well, the logical reason would be that we&#39;re on an unexplored world with thousands of dangerous creatures roaming the undergrowth.&quot; **
(115) Female pilot: What are you doing here?
** (119) Admiral Alvar would have pointed out he didnt have to take -any- direction from her but kept silent. **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;We&#39;re here to offer gifts to the little friends here, and find something important to us. that&#39;s all. We came up here, to make sure you were alright.&quot;
(115) Female pilot: You are civilians?
(115) Female pilot: Scholars?
(115) Female pilot: What?
(115) Female pilot: Spacers?
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighed &quot;Will you agree to be civil and put the weapon away first?&quot; **
(115) Female pilot: ((her weapon is away.))
(117) Captain Daiyu: (last we saw she had a hand on something)
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;If you could remain as you are miss, you will find us most agreeable. We only wish to speak&quot;
(115) Female pilot: Speak then.
** (115) Female pilot kept her hand close to her holster&#8230;. **
** (115) Female pilot notices Terseht has two pistols. **
(115) Female pilot: You seem very well armed.
(115) Female pilot: Those aren&#39;t hunting weapons.
** (117) Captain Daiyu nods her head &quot;We are military..just as you are. The faction is&#8230;not on the same terms but, we don&#39;t mean you harm&#8230;&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;So do you&#8230;since when do sick people have hidden weapons?&quot;
(115) Female pilot: I have one pistol.
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;m a pilot.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;More than I have at the moment&#8230;&quot;
(115) Female pilot: And which military are you with?
(115) Female pilot: But your friends
(115) Female pilot: Are well armed.
(115) Female pilot: Especially that man&#8230;
** (115) Female pilot points to Terseht. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu shakes her head &quot;I can&#39;t speak more on it until I know you won&#39;t fire that.&quot; she smiles faintly. and motions to the door &quot;Ters, would you mind leaving the hut please. Jan, step back a bit?&quot; **
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;We are only well armed to combat the many dangers of the planet. As you know Endor is host to variety of deadly creatures&quot;
(115) Female pilot: I won&#39;t use my weapon&#8230;.
(115) Female pilot: But I&#39;m leaving&#8230;
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;Perhaps if I merely took the power packs out of my weapons that would satiate your desire for equal terms?&quot;
** (115) Female pilot watches the group warily. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu stands and holds her hands out &quot;Wait. please. we need to know something and you are the only one to answer it.&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Or if the lady prefers&#8230;.she could speak to the only unarmed person here&#8230;&quot; He then shook his head &quot;I just have a few questions then you can leave.&quot;
(115) Female pilot: What the hell is this?
** (115) Female pilot stepped down from her cot. **
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;m leaving.
** (333) Commodore Janelle heaves a quiet sigh, taking a step back as watches the woman silently. **
(115) Female pilot: Please let me through.
** (119) Admiral Alvar took a step back away as well. More than one way to skin a cat. **
(115) Female pilot: ((You notice a very crude bandage around her left arm))
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Come on, let the lady leave.&quot;
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighed &quot;Who ordered the attack on the landing pad a few days ago.&quot; **
** (208) Lt. Terseht steps away with a large sidestep **
(117) Captain Daiyu: (this would go so much better if people listened. not you jan.)
(115) Female pilot: What are you talking about?
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;m leaving.
(119) Admiral Alvar: (listened how? You had a chance now shes leaving&#8230;Hes stepping in.)
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( I am most amazing person ever. ))
(117) Captain Daiyu: (chance what chance?! he undermined her and spoke up and didn&#39;t listen to shit!)
** (115) Female pilot walked through the entry way of the hut&#8230;.. **
(117) Captain Daiyu: (and not just him)
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Not with a bandage like that&#8230;.We can fix that for you.&quot;
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;How&#39;s your arm.&quot;
** (115) Female pilot turned smoothly to not keep her back at you&#8230;. **
(115) Female pilot: No, I&#39;m ok&#8230;
** (115) Female pilot began backpedaling to the nearest lift&#8230;. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;You sure? Looks like a mediocre job.&quot;
(115) Female pilot: I&#39;ll find aid elsewhere&#8230;.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;If you think you can leave then fine, but you will miss the celebration&#8230;&quot;

(115) Female pilot: ((One second))
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head with a roll of her eyes, turning around to watch them all with a disapproving frown. **
(115) Female pilot: No&#8230;
(115) Female pilot: That&#39;s ok.
** (115) Female pilot began rotating the crank to the wooden lift&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu throws her hands in the air, crossing them again, while she suppressed the urge to kick the bed. turning to Janelle she shakes her head as well. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: ((How the hell did a 34 lose&#8230;? Her will should be lower than that being alone.)
(115) Female pilot: ((-10 on your check))
(119) Admiral Alvar: (Why?)
(115) Female pilot: ((Hostile))
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( we&#39;re all wearing Imperial Grey, I do believe.))
(117) Captain Daiyu: (not me. but doesn&#39;t seem to matter.)
(115) Female pilot: ((Yea most of you are wearing imp uniforms))
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;perhaps you might stay so we could merely exchange information. if you feel that we are too numerous we can lower the numbers to your suit, but I would very much like to continue this conversation&quot; [1d20+17] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [18,17] = (35) persuasion
** (115) Female pilot looks at Terseht as the lift gets to the top&#8230;. **
(115) Female pilot: No&#8230;
** (119) Admiral Alvar got his comlink ready, seeing as he was still in the hut room and she was outside. **
(115) Female pilot: That won&#39;t be necessary.
** (115) Female pilot got on the lift. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu moved to the lift &quot;Look all we want is to talk. you&#39;re free to go, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to arrest you or anything, but we do want some answers and right now you&#39;re all we have.&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;Pilot is about to try and leave. Have someone ready to intercept, but out of sight&#8230;.and silently.&quot;
(117) Captain Daiyu: [1d20+11] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [5,11] = (16)
(117) Captain Daiyu: (yea that failed miserably)
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;-Yes sir, we have eyes on the village&mdash;-
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;We won&#39;t let her leave&mdash;-
** (115) Female pilot lowered herself down about 13 feet to the forest floor. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;No Ewok targets. Understood? Just the pilot. Set to stun.&ndash;
** (333) Commodore Janelle takes a step back inside as well, raising her com as well to speak softly into it. &quot;Be sure to incapacitate her, not kill. Wounded shoulder, single blaster. She&#39;s likely heading to her starship.&quot; **
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( starship, starfighter. same thing))
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;We have to be within 9 meters for stun range&mdash;
(208) Lt. Terseht: &quot;I assure you the exchange would be quite beneficial for both parties. Should you accept we have no qualms of letting you go on your way&quot;
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;We&#39;d have to occupy the village&mdash;
** (115) Female Pilot was walking to the opposite end of hte village. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu watched her go silently, then set out after her, cranking the ramp back up as fast as she could, hopping on and heading down after her. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle lowers her com with a bemused little snort, shaking her head and sighing quietly. &quot;Yes, the greatest minds of the Empire, indeed.&quot; She&#39;s fond of sarcasm, following along after Daiyu. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Then just do what you can before this gets into the village. Go around, intercept her, and quickly.&ndash; ((Alvar had stated on numerous occassions that the troopers should -surround- the boundary line.
(115) Female Pilot: &ndash;They are surrounding&mdash;-
** (115) &mdash;How many men do you need?&mdash; . **
** (117) Captain Daiyu took off at a run for the woman &quot;Wait! please! ancesters would you stop a moment! what have you got against talking to us??&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: You&#39;re imperials!
(115) Female Pilot: Leave me be&#8230;.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Daiyu, break off. Do not create a scene.&ndash;
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;And you&#39;re republic and we haven&#39;t shot at you! so there&#39;s got to be something here! let us try a peaceful conversation we were doing well before the boys got in on it!&quot;
(115) Female Pilot: I don&#39;t know why you have spared me!
(115) Female Pilot: But I&#39;m not gonna stick around to think about it!
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;Atleast she&#39;s not blind.&quot; She idly muses on that as she follows along at a slow pace, hm&#39;ing softly.
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Sir how many men do you need in the village?&mdash; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;You don&#39;t deserve to die! there&#39;s no reason for it!&quot; she runs a bit more and grabs on to her arm.
** (115) Female Pilot faces the Captain **
(115) Female Pilot: What the? Your face?!
(115) Female Pilot: Serves you right Imperial!
(119) Admiral Alvar: &mdash;Three at the most Captain. Do not create a scene. Give Captain Daiyu a few more chances but once she crosses that boundary line&#8230;move in. Do -NOT- kill.&ndash;
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;Roger Sir, they are double timing to your position!&mdash;
** (117) Captain Daiyu feels her head sharply, and looks away &quot;how does it serve me right?&quot; she asks, &quot;answer me that. how does this serve me right?&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: I&#39;m obviously at your mercy&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: Please let me go.
(115) Female Pilot: I&#39;ve lost everything
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;No.I want to know why this happened to me. I was standing there. that&#39;s all I was doing. standing there when those bombs hit. we hadn&#39;t done anything and this happened. why. tell em that.&quot;
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Again, Daiyu. Do -not- create a scene! If these Ewok&#39;s get upset over this then it&#39;s all over for us.&ndash; &ndash;Captain, hold once you get into position. Captain Daiyu might be getting somewhere.&mdash;
(115) Female Pilot: Let me go&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: We are at war.
(115) Female Pilot: And that was battle.
(115) Female Pilot: There doesn&#39;t need to be any more casualties.
(115) Female Pilot: Let me go please.
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head with a quiet sigh as she steps up behind Daiyu, watching the woman curiously. &quot;If you come with us, you will be given safe passage to return home, once you&#39;ve answered a few questions. We can&#39;t gurantee your safety otherwise, I&#39;m afraid.&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Tell me why pilot! WE were here for a mission that was NOT for battle.!&quot;
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( am i meant to be rolling stuff for that i forget

** (333) Commodore Janelle takes a step closer, sighing softly as she looks about, judging just how many furballs are watching&#8230; and how far away the starship is. **

(115) Female Pilot: Away from my ship&#8230;.
** (119) Admiral Alvar calls out &quot;AI already gave them the order to allow you to pass!&quot; &ndash;Captain&#8230;move them away from the ship.&ndash; **
** (115) Female Pilot gets about 20 feet from the X-wing&#8230;. **
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Sir are you sure?!&mdash; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Do you not see Daiyu as a hostage? Do it, now!&ndash;
(333) Commodore Janelle: -And if she decides to try and take her with her into the starfighter? Once she does that, it&#39;ll be impossible to retrieve her.&quot;
** (117) Captain Daiyu continues with her &quot;this really wasn&#39;t your best way you know..you didn&#39;t want anymore pain and bloodshed did you? neither do I. but you&#39;re not setting a great example you know.&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: Imperial Commander!
(115) Female Pilot: Listen to my next instruction.
** (115) . Daiyu noticed that her Muynip had flown away. **
(115) Female Pilot: Bring an unarmed man to power up my vehicle.
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighs faintly &quot;You scared my little friend away you know&#8230;&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;I liked him..&quot;
(119) Admiral Alvar: &quot;I can do that myself if you wish&#8230;I am unarmed.&quot;
** (115) Female Pilot steers Daiyu 20 feet to the side of the X wing. **
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head with a quiet sigh, reaching down to simply unclip her belt, letting her blaster and holster fall to the ground. &quot;-You don&#39;t even know how to work the damn thing.-&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;I can do it too, you&#39;ll have to let me go, but I can do it.&quot;
(115) Female Pilot: There are other ships!
(115) Female Pilot: So if you try to fly it away, she dies!
(115) Female Pilot: You think I&#39;m stupid to let you go?
(115) Female Pilot: Commander! Power up my X wing!
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;No, I think you&#39;re scared, in a situation you never thought you&#39;d be in, and now..you just want to go home.&quot;
** (119) Admiral Alvar starts to move to do as the crazy lady asked. &quot;It might take me a few moments but I am on my way.&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: I am leaving.
(115) Female Pilot: Now shut up&#8230;.
** (333) Commodore Janelle mutters quietly under her breath as she moves forward, hands raised to show the fact that she&#39;s now actually&#8230;y &#39;know, weaponless. She likes starfighters. &quot;-Admiral, please remain there. You&#39;re a bit safer at the moment.&quot; **
** (119) Admiral Alvar started moving towards the x-wing&#8230;hand sin the air. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( Because Janelle actually knows how they work! Hah. ))
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;do you feel good about yourself though&#8230;at the end of the day..will you sleep well at night because you did this?&quot;
** (119) Admiral Alvar stopped moving -Janelle&#8230;Go ahead and do it.&ndash; **
(115) Female Pilot: Be quiet.
** (333) Commodore Janelle moves forwards&#8230; as, well, she was doing already, her eyes narrowed as she goes to pass the two. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Daiyu, listen to me for once. Shut. Up. You are no good to me or anyone here with a hole in your head.&ndash;
** (115) Female Pilot moved to the opposite flank of Janelle&#8230;. **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Hit a nerve huh? I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep. I&#39;d have nightmares I think..&quot;
(115) Female Pilot: There&#39;s a ladder on the left side of the cockpit&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: Climb up and go inside!
** (119) Admiral Alvar moves off towards the huts again&#8230;slowly, hands in the air. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;I&#39;m well aware.&quot; She goes to clamber inside the cockpit, turning just far enough to check and make sure that there&#39;s not two seats or anything of the sort.
(115) Female Pilot: There are four green switches right underneath the sensor display&#8230;.
(115) Female Pilot: Push them.
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( are there two seats? :P ))
(115) Female Pilot: ((no))
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( Just making sure!))
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Captain&#8230;?&ndash;
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Yes sir?&mdash;- **
** (333) Commodore Janelle reaches out to flick the switches requested, hmph&#39;ing softly as she restrains the urge to roll her eyes, along with the desire to do a great deal many more things. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu sighs faintly &quot;You know..for what it&#39;s worth. I hope you have a good and safe flight home.&quot; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: ? I am guessing that he is out of range of cvourse for her to here since he ais at the huts?)
(115) Female pilot: Now there is a yellow cord, next to front right corner of the dashboard&#8230;.unattach that, and plug it into the left side rectangular port.
(333) Commodore Janelle: (( No, she just can&#39;t really tlak over the comms, cans ee? :P ))
** (333) Commodore Janelle does as requested yet again, her boot beginning to tap a bit impatiently at her ordering. **
(115) Female pilot: Shut up hostage.
(119) Admiral Alvar: (Not Janelle&#8230;.Im talking bout the female pilot))
** (115) . The X wing powers to life&#8230;.. **
(333) Commodore Janelle: ( Oh. ))
(115) Female Pilot: Now get out of the cockpit.
(119) Admiral Alvar: (dw. Is the FP out of range to hear Alvar on the comms))
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Simply wishing you well. my name is Daiyu, by the way. you should know if you shoot me.&quot;
** (333) Commodore Janelle clambers out, as requested! As she hops to the ground, she focuses her glare on the woman, shaking her head with a resigned sigh. **
(115) Female Pilot: You will not be shot, so long as your friends comply.
(115) Female Pilot: Now step back to your commander&#8230;.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Are -they- in position&#8230;? Can you see clearly&#8230;?&ndash; (Translates into Are the snipers ready, do they have a clear shot
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;They will, because we&#39;re friends. and they would have let you go too.&quot;
** (333) Commodore Janelle mutters quietly as she moves back around the X-wing, stepping towards the village. If looks could kill! **
** (115) Female Pilot takes Daiyu around the front of the X wing, wanting to avoid the jet wash. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu follows around &quot;What&#39;s your name.&quot; **
(115) Female Pilot: Quiet.
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;Simple question.&quot;
** (119) Admiral Alvar waited nervously. If this went wrong&#8230;He didnt want to think about that. As far as he knew, Alliance personell were very&#8230;honour bound. **
** (115) Female Pilot awkwardly climbed up the ladder, while maintaining her grip for as long as she could&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu moved with her to make it easier &quot;I forgive you for this. illogical though it was.&quot; **
** (115) Female Pilot holds the the barrel over the top part of her skull. **
** (115) Female Pilot breaks the hold and dives into the cockpit after climbing up&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu rushes down the ladder and breaks for the trees. **
(115) Female Pilot: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [15,12] = (27)
(119) Admiral Alvar: -Fire!-
(115) Female Pilot: [3d8+16] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [2,1,5,16] = (24)
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Either disable the damned ship or kill her dead.&ndash;
** (115) Female Pilot the shot nails hits her X wing as she crawls into the cockpit&#8230;. **
** (115) Female Pilot the cockpit begins to seal. **
(115) Female Pilot: [1d20+16] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [6,16] = (22)
** (333) Commodore Janelle scowls slightly as that, dodging away as she scurries for cover. &quot;-Admiral, she is in a bloody starfighter! You&#39;re not going to bring her down with blasters.- **
** (115) X-Wing rises up&#8230;. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu brings the com up &quot;-let her go&#8230;just let her g-&quot; **
** (115) X-Wing thrusts forward. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Comms the troopers- Order the Destroyer top take her out.
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Yes sir!&mdash; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;-let her go dammit! just let her go!-&quot;
** (115) . The sound of the X wing departing had attracted all the ewoks to the other side of the village&#8230;. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Wait till she is in space.&ndash;
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Yes sir!&mdash; **
** (333) Commodore Janelle shakes her head as she moves over to Daiyu, murmuring softly as she steps over to her. &quot;You are unharmed, I presume? The Admiral is not going to listen to reason where you are involved, Daiyu.&quot; **
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;-what part of let her do you people not understand!-
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;Orders relayed, The Venerator and Adjudicator are moving to blockade&#8230;.&mdash; **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Unless the Tractor Beam can get her&#8230;.&ndash;
(333) Commodore Janelle: &quot;&#8230; Especially when there are viable tactical concerns involved in such.&quot; She frowns heavily as she looks up to the stars, sighing quietly.
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;That would be the best but if not, shoot to kill.&ndash;
(117) Captain Daiyu: &quot;-Alvar! let her go!-&quot;
** (115) Captain Tarell &mdash;They are scanning for the X-Wing now sir&#8230;.&mdash;- **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Not this time Daiyu. She gets away she tells her freinds and people about us here. I will not have that happen, not again.&ndash;
** (117) Captain Daiyu glanced up to Janelle, it was slowly sinking in what had just happened, her body was shaking even while one hand was tryig to keep her hair covering her left side &quot;-She wasn&#39;t going to hurt me. She was scared, let her go.-&quot; **
** (333) Commodore Janelle looks back to Daiyu, watching her for a few long moments before stepping closer, reaching out to place one hopefully reassuring hand against her arm. **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;You think I wasnt scared?! I almost lost one of my best Officers and someone I care for. I will -not- let her go!&ndash;
** (115) White furred ewok walked over to Daiyu and patted her consolingly. **
** (115) White furred ewok was her friend from before. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu darts back away from her, like some frightened animal, even tripping over herself to fall back, shaking like a leaf &quot;-let her go. please.-&quot; **
** (115) White furred ewok &mdash;Both ships report no sign of the X-Wing&mdash;- **
(115) Captain Tarell: &mdash;She should of been in orbit by now&mdash;
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;We are Imperials Daiyu. We&ndash; He curses for a moment before saying &ndash;You got your wish, the ships lost track of her.&ndash; &ndash;Keep searching. Scan the planet if you have to.&ndash;
** (333) Commodore Janelle flinches away at that, staring at her a few long moments before she simply goes quiet, watching in silence. Like that odd little lady who always tries to help yet fails miserably every time. **
** (117) Captain Daiyu dropped the comlink and curled into herself, shaking and rocking. Even knowing she wouldn&#39;t have fired, she&#39;d never been in that situation before. **
** (115) . Your chronos read 1117 **
(119) Admiral Alvar: &ndash;Someone get a stretcher for Captain Daiyu, find her a hut that is unoccupied to rest in.&ndash;</span>
