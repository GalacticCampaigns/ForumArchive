**Orbital is a variant of the station class, which is unique to the Death Star. Its challenge level is labeled as infinite, which means any creature or vehicle that encounters it should expect it as an near impossible encounter with many deaths and destroyed vehicles. It is factored into the CL simply as * with all other enemies and obstacles accounted for (e.g. CL 20* or CL14*). The mass of the 160 KM battlestation is equivalent to a moon. Thus, the primary mass of the Death Star is invulnerable to mostly all types of damage, with few exceptions. Damage Resist and HP are infinite.
As it is a tremendous battlestation in terms of size, it does have various installations and equipment which can be individually targeted. The CL and level of the target are determined at random or determined by where the attack is taking place. For example, the Death Star equatorial trench, with turbolaser turrets, has a combined CL of 20. If starfighters choose to assault here they face an individual CL independent of the Death Star’s main CL. The case remains the same if starfighters choose to attack a singular turbolaser tower which may be CL 8. Thus, individual targets on the Death Star take damage as normal, but do not take away from the Death Star’s infinite hp. There may be individual weak points that can be destroyed as normal that can destroy the Death Star in a single move; however this is to be determined by the GM.
It takes a fighting space of 4 by 4 on the starship scale. However, when a Colossal (station) vehicle or less enters into point blank range with the Death Star; the starship scale of the Death Star becomes the battle space. Size is still abstract based on the vehicles or objects at point blank range with the Death Star. While point blank within the Death Star’s fighting space, weapon batteries attack at half their listed number. For example, an X-wing is point blank on the Death Star’s northern hemisphere, only the 2500 batteries of that hemisphere can possibly hit it. How many weapons that can target the X-wing from here depends on its range. If it is crossing the axis to draw fire, maybe 800 can target it. If it is in the equatorial trench, maybe 8 or so can target it. The batteries that can target are abstract and subject to GM discretion.*
***Apply a -20 penalty on attacks against targets smaller than Colossal (cruiser) size. The Death Star’s superweapon’s damage is incalculable at full power at destroys whatever it hits. However, when it targets Colossal (cruiser) size or higher it deals amount listed below at minimum power setting. On maximum setting the Superlaser takes one day to recharge before it is able to fire again. On minimum setting, it takes one hour before fire capability.* 
*Apply a -20 penalty on attacks against targets smaller than Colossal size.*
****Apply a -20 penalty on attacks against targets smaller than Colossal size .*
