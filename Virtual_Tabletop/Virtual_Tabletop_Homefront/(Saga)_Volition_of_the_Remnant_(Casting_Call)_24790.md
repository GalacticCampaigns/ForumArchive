# (Saga) Volition of the Remnant (Casting Call)

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-08-31 17:13:41)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">*It was a time of relative peace in the galaxyâ€¦all was well to most people. However, some chosen few made a tremendous discovery. This discovery had set a ripple in the Force which no mere man could hope to refute. The nature of the discovery itself inflicted great death and tragedy. In spite of this disaster, one being stands defiant with powerful secrets in his grasp.
This man happens to be a lost agent of the Sith. The Sith now ponders his next move through the Force since he now has very great knowledge in his possession.
Meanwhile, the Imperial Remnant endures tension amongst their ranks. After the signing of Pellaeon-Gavrisom treaty, some members of the Imperial Senate are unhappy. Some do not trust the current political direction of the Empire.
And at the peak of all this, a deal has been struck between the Empire and a mysterious figure. This person claims to be a simple messenger for horrendous things to come. But the people who possess this knowledge could be given great power. Fortunately for the Remnant, they were the first ones to discover this dark messenger . . . .*</span>
This is a virtual tabletop game set in the Star Wars realm during the New Jedi Order era. Players will assume the role of Naval Imperial officers during the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion and assume command of a fearsome Star Destroyer. The Moff Council passes down unpopular orders in spite of a tragic war. The naval personnel must keep their sanity and learn to separate feelings from the uniform.
There are some traditionalists who wish to revive the old way of the Empire, and there are those who favor a more neutral stance. You must discover your identity above the rank and file. Do you have what it takes to make the decisions no one else wants to? Can you put it all on the line?
As of now, play times are up in the air. We need to collaborate and discuss this when the roster starts filling up. To play, you will need to go here and download the apps... <!-- m -->[http://www.openrpg.com](http://www.openrpg.com "http://www.openrpg.com")<!-- m -->. Here are the current slots...

Well guys, we now have 4 players that have expressed interest. Now we need to discuss the play times. I'm open any time of the week. I plan to have one session per week, and it will be a 3 hour segment. We need to coordinate the times when we will all be available. What times are good for you guys?

As of now, I can confirm Sarin's schedule. He says he can play anytime past the afternoon except on Wednesday's. I'll need to know Zerah's, Ganthet's, and Myles1076's openings before we can move this forward. Let me know when you guys can play when it's convenient to you.

I happened across your room on OpenRPG earlier but the game was already full. Too bad as your concept sounds like it will be a lot of fun. I'm definitely interested If you end up with an opening. Thanks!

I'll let you know Mythos. Players come and go like the seasons! Heck, some of them just like making character sheets without ever playing! lol

Hello,
I am the guy who looked in on your game earlier today (the 23rd, whenever you read this), asking about any openings. You jumped off before I could get an answer, so I shot you a PM
