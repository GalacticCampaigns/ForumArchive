# LFG Virtual Tabletop {SAGA OR} or {d20 Modern}

### **Ryder2101** (2013-02-17 22:38:50)

I was referred to this site by a friend on another forum to look for a game.
Currently I am interested in playing SW Saga Edition in an Old republic setting or d20 Modern game with either a Future feel or Apocalypse feel.
I currently am registered on the Roll20 site but can register to a different site if that is where the Virtual Tabletop game will play.
I use Myth-Weavers to build my online character sheets and have digital copies of just about all the d20 core rule set books.
I would be available to play once a week in the evenings of Tuesday or Thursday (after 1800 PST) or on Saturday in the afternoon or late evenings for at least 3 hours maybe more per session.
I used to be an avid player of the 1st & 2nd Edition DnD rule set but recently received and interest in SAGA and D20 Modern. I like the ability to Roleplay my characters out to some degree, but I try not to be a rule whore, although I do keep in mind that the rules are there for a reason. It has been over 10 years since I really played but am really interested in getting back into the feel of a tabletop style game.
Sincerely,
Ryder

Welcome to the site =)
I have to say that you may have a hard time finding a game at the moment. Most games run here are PbP, only one ORPG game is currently running. I have no idea if they are taking in new players, but the GM has been pretty open to add players in the past, so you could always ask.
I don´t know if you´ve tried playing PbP and it wasn´t for you, but if you haven´t, I´d suggest you give it a go, especially since you say you like to roleplay your character. I only have limited experience with ORPG, but I feel that I get much more roleplaying done playing PbP.

Haven't tried PbP before. Didn't look like my thing but I definitely can look into it. Just really interested in playing again. Was playing a virtual tabletop but the last 2 scheduled games the GM has had issues.
Guess I will start looking for a PbP game unless anyone knows of a game looking for Players.
SAGA Game I'm interested in playing a Soldier/Scoundrel, maybe with limited Force sensitivity.
D20 Modern I'm interested in playing a Fast/Strong Hero in either a current timeline or future time setting.
