# Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulation

### **Alicia** (2012-02-14 18:46:54)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">This topic has been moved to subsequent threads available in the [Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=248 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=248") forum</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Artemis is a multiplayer, multi-computer networked game for Windows computers.
Artemis simulates a spaceship bridge by networking several computers together. One computer runs the simulation and the &quot;main screen&quot;, while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do, like Helm, Communication, Engineering, and Weapon Control.
Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room (&quot;bridge&quot;) , and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain, a person who sits in the middle, doesn&#39;t have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.
Artemis is a software game for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.</span>
This is a good explanatory video with gameplay examples

<details><summary>▶ Q: What are the system requirements? How good does my computer have to be?:dv5j0mkm</summary>

A: Well, I WOULD say that any DirectX 9 computer should be able to run it. BUT, I've had people say now that their old machines 1) have DirectX 9 and 2) can't start the game. That's probably true. The engine assumes some things like 24-bits of color and a 16-bit Z-buffer, plus basic hardware shaders (Shader Model 2.0).
However, finding out if your machine does all that and more is a waste of time. The demo is free and small. [Download it and try it](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/download/Artemis_demo_v1_40_2.exe:dv5j0mkm "http://www.artemis.eochu.com/download/Artemis_demo_v1_40_2.exe:dv5j0mkm"). If it doesn't work, then it doesn't work.

<details><summary>▶ Q: Why is Artemis only for Windows computers?:dv5j0mkm</summary>

A: Fans on the forums have been able to play Artemis on Macs using [Wineskin](http://wineskin.doh123.com/Information.html:dv5j0mkm "http://wineskin.doh123.com/Information.html:dv5j0mkm"). Unix guys have also had luck using Wine 1.3.
[More info about running under Wineskin](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/?page_id=28#/20120111/artemis-16-under-wineskin-1173966/:dv5j0mkm "http://www.artemis.eochu.com/?page_id=28#/20120111/artemis-16-under-wineskin-1173966/:dv5j0mkm")

A full copy of the game will be provided to those serious about participating.
I would like to run this on a Sunday on a semi regular basis (once to twice a month) and access to a VOIP such as Teamspeak 3 or Skype is required. Communication in this game is key to success and VOIP allows for such. It's a bit of a pain int he butt to have to switch from one window to another to communicate through IMs, etc). As I have a Teamspeak 3 server available we can use that, but I'm also open to using Skype I just feel TS3 is less resource intensive.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Adding a View Screen window</span>
Since we aren't running in one room, not everyone will get to see a view screen during play. Thanks to a fellow player on the Artemis forums, we have a solution to counter this.

**Instructions**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Download [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/:dv5j0mkm "http://www.autohotkey.com/:dv5j0mkm")
Use the Artemis Script and hot keys found [here](http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/:dv5j0mkm "http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/:dv5j0mkm").
**To Create the Script**
1. Right-click an empty spot on your desktop or in a folder of your choice.
2. In the menu that appears, select New -> AutoHotkey Script. (Alternatively, select New -> Text Document.)
3. Type a name for the file, ensuring that it ends in .ahk. For example: Artemis.ahk
4. Right-click the file and choose Edit Script.
5. On a blank line, copy and paste the script found [here](http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/:dv5j0mkm "http://artemis.arkgeeks.us/utilities/autohotkey-scripts/:dv5j0mkm").
6. Save the file, preferably on the desktop.
7. Close Editor[/list:o:dv5j0mkm]
Once open, the script will appear on your taskbar running in the background and you may pause or close it at will here. You can run as many scripts as you want, each appearing as their own icon on the taskbar.
**Using the script to create a MAIN SCREEN (view screen)**
1. Open an instance of Artemis at size *800x600* in *windowed* mode. (An instance is considered to be a new window which is controlled separately from others.) The first instance we become the view screen while the second will be the game play window
2. Connect to server and select MAIN SCREEN
3. Click Ready to Play
4. Set the size of this window to your preferred small size (The smallest is CTRL+C [sets to 320x240])
5. Open your second instance to your preferred resolution in windowed mode preferably one setting smaller than your desktop resolution
6. Use ALT+TAB to select your Main Screen window
7. Move the window to your desired location (You may encounter an error relating to the D3D device. Hit ok and ignore it)
8. With the Main Screen window selected hit CTRL+A to toggle it always on top
9. Additionally you can set the Transparency (CTRL+T) or Opaqueness (CTRL+ALT+T) [/list:o:dv5j0mkm]
**List of Available commands**
*CTRL+H* for help screen (this list of commands)
*CTRL+A* on window to toggle always on top
Sizes
*CTRL-Z* 800×600
*CTRL-X* 500×300
*CTRL-C* 320×240

As an aside if there's a great deal of interest to fill all positions and then some we can see about running multiple crews. Up to 4 crews I believe can run at the same time.

### **jaybee3** (2012-02-15 03:49:31)

Oooo I'm up for this, time dependent of course, Engineering or Science I'd go for.
What does the demo client get you access to?

---

### **Alicia** (2012-02-15 08:00:07)

Demo gives you access to just three stations. Helm, weapons and a third I can't recall off the top of my head.
> **Edit:**

> Captain is the third, though technically all the captain does is give orders and makes sure the stations work together! &lt;!&ndash; s:lol: &ndash;&gt;![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s:lol: &ndash;&gt;

What's nice is we can double up the stations of we need to.
I'll edit the first post once I can look at the stations again. It's been awhile.

I'm willing to do Engineering or helm at this time (until I learn more about the game)

### **Alicia** (2012-02-18 09:59:50)

Think we're going to try and play this Sunday (2/17). 2p ET sound good?

---

### **Xane** (2012-03-12 00:39:43)

Saw a link to this thread from the Artemis forums, if you're still planning on doing this I'd love to join! I have SLIGHT preference for Engineering but I'm fine with whatever.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-03-13 19:51:19)

I'd like to get people together again soon for this.
When are you available?

---

### **Duggs** (2012-03-20 17:09:02)

I would be interested in trying this. I would like to do weapons or science.

---

### **Alicia** (2012-07-02 16:12:21)

I'd like to get a crew together in the next couple weeks. Maybe on a Sunday or Thurs evening? Could probably do a weekday Tues- Thurs depending on everyone's availability.
Who's game?

---

### **fraszoid** (2012-07-02 19:47:11)

I'd be interested in playing Engineering or Science, but I'll fill any role. I've played the demo solo so I know how Helm and Weapons work, as well as I have I joystick so I'm well equipped for Helm.
For contact info:
MSN: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:fraszoid@hotmail.com">fraszoid@hotmail.com</a><!-- e --> for both e-mail and MSN messenger
Skype: fraszoid
Also have TS3 and Ventrillo for voice comms.

### **Duggs** (2012-07-02 22:00:14)

I only have the demo, and I would like to play as the Weapons Officer, though I could fill any role. I am available most nights. My Skype is Frank.Duggins.
