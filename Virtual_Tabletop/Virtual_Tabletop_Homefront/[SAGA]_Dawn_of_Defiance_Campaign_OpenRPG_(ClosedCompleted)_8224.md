Once you have reviewed the website and forum; please get back to me with your character sheet if you have not done so.
**If you wish to play any kind of Force user, please keep this in mind:** As per the side note on page 103 (yellow box), use of the skill Use the Force will cause a disturbance in the Force. Constant use will make it EASIER for the Empire to locate you. Same with lightsabers. All players playing Force users and especially Jedi will have to be smart on how that character is player.

I thought I should go ahead and post, figuring I should put down my official available times. I am free most nights unless something comes up, which is possible, seeing as how I am in the military. At any time, they may put me on a night shift
With that said, I would prefer weekends, Friday, Saturday or Sunday.

Right now it looks as if we will be playing Saturday evenings starting at 5pm or 6pm EST.
That means our first session will be April 5th.
Does this work for everyone?

Those times work just fine for me.
Could you post the name of the room you will create and what server it will be under so I can find you when the time comes?
May the force be with you all, until then.

You can count me in, the only reason i backed out of your other game was that you had enough players and needed to tone down. Sorry but ill play in this one.

I was unsure about an aspect of the condition track so I went to the WotC for an answer. My question was this:
> Q: Do you apply your condition track penalties to your threshold since they lower your Fortitude Defense?
> A: Yes. Any modifiers applied to your Fortitude Defense should also effect your threshold (even temporary ones), be they from armor, the condition track, ability score increases, etc.

This is an official answer, so starting next session I am instituting this.
If anyone would like to read the FAQ I got this from [click here](http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=865406 "http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=865406")

## Re: [SAGA] Dawn of Defiance Campaign: OpenRPG (casting OPEN!

### **Alicia** (2009-01-20 07:49:35)

I am looking for two dedicated players who can commit to playing in this campaign.
All information can be found on the first post of this thread and on the website. Up to date information is also kept in the dedicated [Out of Game thread](http://galacticcampaigns.com/smf/http://galacticcampaigns.com//viewforum.php?f=4.0 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/smf/http://galacticcampaigns.com//viewforum.php?f=4.0").
All source books (including Clone Wars) may be used and content from Conversion sites though material is subject to approval
The current level is 7 and I am NOT accepting any Jedi at this time.
Please keep in mind this is a hybrid campaign, though it is primarily played on OpenRPG. I do request that players be able to post about twice a week.
Feel free to message me using the various messengers listed in my profile or send me a PM.
