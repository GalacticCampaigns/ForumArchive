# [(SW SAGA) Volition of the Remnant] Play Session Logs

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-10-25 03:03:08)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">SESSION 1</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">*It was a time of relative peace in the galaxy&#8230;
All was well to most people that inhabited the galaxy.
However, some chosen few made a tremendous discovery.
This discovery had set a ripple in the Force which no mere mortal could refute.
The nature of this discovery inflicted great death and tragedy.
In spite of this disaster, one being stands defiant with powerful secrets at his grasp&#8230;.
This man happens to be a lost agent of the Sith. The Sith now ponders his next move through the Force since he now has very great knowledge in his possession.
Meanwhile, the Imperial Remnant endures tension amongst their ranks. After the signing of Pellaeon-Gavrisom treaty, some members of the Imperial Senate are unhappy.
Some do not trust the current political direction of the Empire&#8230;
And at the peak of these events; a deal has been struck between the Empire and a mysterious figure.
This person claims to be a simple messenger for horrendous things to come.
But the people who possess this knowledge could be given great power.
Fortunately for the Remnant, they were the first ones to discover this dark messenger . . . .*
*On the dark and stormy world of Thule, this dark messenger has traveled near and far in search of his answers&#8230;the meaning behind his master&#39;s disappearance
His recent discovery was an impact crater&#8230;something that suggested that his master had been through here. But, as Sarin searched through the Force&#8230;he felt no trace of him.
He made his long trek over the treacheous rocky valley that separated him from the Electus Temple. The Temple Darth Strife had guarded with all of his life
The Sith Apprentice had arrived in the sacrificial chambers, were great knowledge was known to reside.
He stood upon the stone walkway, as the blood rivers flowed at his side, with Sith statues flanking the corridor. The altar at the end of the room bore a single trinket.
He felt the Force emanating powerfully from this trinket.
Was this Sarin&#39;s answer he was seeking?*
Sarin: Feeling the power of the Small object Sarin found himself craving to touch the trinket. every inch of his massive form craved this power. Sarin reached for the miniscule item and grasped it in his massive palm.
*The object was made from a black, stone like material&#8230;it had jewels engraved all over it.
At the very tip of the small pyramid, was a white glowing point. It seemed to be reacting to Sarin&#39;s interaction.
Suddenly, and very strangely, he could feel the presence of his Master. Along with a very distinctive energy strong with the Dark Side.
An almost holographic image of Darth Strife projected himself in front of Sarin, almost as if it was his spirit.
Sarin knew this to be one of Strife&#39;s most powerful holocrons, and knowing his master&#8230;it was left here for a reason.
The spiritual entity began speaking to Sarin.*
Darth Strife: Whether Sarin or Elecia gain possession of this knowledge, cements the fact that I have perished.
Darth Strife: Know this, that the one who gathered this has become the one. And while you possess the honor and responsibility of the one, remember the Rule of Two. Only two shall remain, but times have changed.
Darth Strife: You must follow your inner boldness and do what you feel is appropriate for the times to come.
Darth Strife: You have been ushered into complete darkness, and are now fostering the vision of tremendous achievement.
Darth Strife: Embrace your passion, and use it to gain strength. You will need it for the journey ahead.
Darth Strife: For within this trinket, extraordinary information resides. You will need the full power of the Dark Side to absorb it.
Darth Strife: Let go of any shred of purity if you&#39;re to attain your greatness.
Darth Strife: Reach into the depths of forbidden ideals, and rip from it pure&#8230;.unstoppable&#8230;.POWER!
Darth Strife: The fact you have survived my trials proves your worth.
Darth Strife: You have endured unimaginable suffering and have now withdrawn even more outstanding ability.
Darth Strife: With this relic as your guide, seek&#8230;. and you shall know the Force.
Darth Strife: Your next motion should be towards the Imperial Remnant.
Darth Strife: Due to the events at Vjun; Falsoor will fall in a matter of time.
Darth Strife: We can no longer use them.
Darth Strife: I was playing both hands, and the Remnant will form an alliance with you.
Darth Strife: And as feared, the Reavers have gone rogue.
Darth Strife: They have fled to a location that is unknown to me; you must do what you can to relocate them.
Darth Strife: I call upon you, the newly christened harbinger of evil, to seek out the Reavers.
Darth Strife: Become strong with the dark side, as you are not the Lord of Evil yet.
Darth Strife: Find out the reason for the Reavers defiance, and harness them for your whim.
Darth Strife: Then, and only then, will you be a Dark Lord of the Sith.
Darth Strife: As for now, seek out Moff Elrik Reyis.
Darth Strife: He will be difficult to find, but seek someone close to him in status.
Darth Strife: Demonstrate your power to those under Moff Reyis, and he will contact you.
Darth Strife: And once this is established, Reyis will see to it that you have the Remnant at your disposal.
Darth Strife: Go now my aspiring Dark Lord&#8230;achieve your destiny of that you have suffered greatly for&#8230;free your soul from your bindings. But beware&#8230;there is another.
Darth Strife: My follower, do you understand your orders?

Sarin: Of course master, I will succeed where you have failed. They will all be mine, I will bring pain to this galaxy and all shall fall before me.
*The Sith laughs with great pleasure&#8230;and the spirit fades into the holocron.
Sarin is quick to notice a datapad laying on the altar close to where the Holocron was.*
Sarin: Sarin clutches the holocron in his fist and places it into his chest cavity for safe keeping, and with a laugh marches over the the altar and retrieves the data pad.
*As he does so, the holocron begins shaking curiously in his chest.*
Sarin: The giant reaches into his chest and pulls out the curious holocron and examines it closely&#8230;
*Something very peculiar happens, as if to punctuate Strife&#39;s disappearance. A projection seems to be generating in front of the hulking Sith apprentice.
It appeared to be a holographic map, and there was text highlighting certain focal points on the planets. At the center of the map, was a strange looking device.
Sarin is not able to understand the language.*
*He focuses on the holocron, trying to understand the meaning of the map.
While he looks at the image, he doesn&#39;t even come close to grasping what it was. But it was definitely ancient in appearance. Someone else would need to appraise this.
It looked up to thousands of years old.*
Sarin: Sarin growled in frustration. nothing was ever easy with his former master.
*Perhaps it was another test from Strife&#8230;to test who was worthy to receive his power.*
*Sarin lets the Force flow through him. He focuses his passion and hatred to open his mind up to the Holocrons secrets.
Indeed, this map led to something of incredible dark energies&#8230;though he had no idea where to start.
He would need help, so it was time for him to seek allies.
Just as his master instructed.*
Sarin placed the holocron back into his chest and with a dark determination in his eyes strode off to begin his dark jorney that would lead him to true power.
*Sarin uses the datapad, and notices that Strife had left a ship behind for him. It was time to seek out the Remnant. But where to start?
Sarin descends into the depths of the dreadful Electus Temple, and finds Strife&#39;s Sith Infiltrator.*
*:::SCENE CHANGE:::*
The Naval officers from the Star Destroyer *Subjugator*, currently find themselves on the streets of Coruscant.
They were there with Captain Narweld, and four other training Ensigns.
You were currently in the bustling bazaar section in the city of Urbid, a city famous for black market deals and prize fighting.
You are all in Imperial dress, awaiting a quick briefing from your newly met Captain.
Captain Narweld : Hello everyone, it&#39;s nice to meet my new crew.
Captain Narweld : I&#39;m Captain Kev Narweld, can I get your names and duties please?
*The ensigns assume a rigid parade stance. The captain quickly dismisses them to relax.*
*The trainee ensigns seemed unnerved at the sight of Coruscant&#39;s diversified inhabitants.*
Kara Rue had only been to the planet a few times in her life, she knew enough though to take her mothers old warnings to heart; keep an eye on your pockets or your purse. The woman comes to a relaxed pose with the order from the Captain, short blonde hair, clear eyes, and a pristine uniform her parents wouldl be proud of. &quot;It&#39;s good to meet you Captain.&quot; she says in that refined tone of her good breeding **
Captain Narweld : Hello, what is your name Lieutenant?
(47) Kara Rue: Kara Rue Sir, Medical Officer.
Captain Narweld : Ahh&#8230;that&#39;s perfect. I assume you&#39;re the one taking over as Chief Medical Officer?
** Trevor Vorhees was somewhat used to the planet but was slightly uncomfortable still being around such diversities. But when you are a Lieutenant, you have to keep such things in check. He stood still, awaiting to be spoken to but kept his eyes on the captain. The helmsman had always learned and known to keep constant eye contact. **

Kara Rue: Aye Sir, it will be a great pleasure to serve this crew.
Captain Narweld : Hmm, you know what I heard about you all?
Captain Narweld : That you were some of the finest young officers that the Navy has to offer.
** Tegan Zadane watched the others quietly. Given leave to relax he hid an amused smile behind an upheld hand, cupped over his chin. Zadane&#39;s uniform and appearance were impleccable, tunic and pants pressed, hair cropped to regulation. **
** Kara Rue felt her chest swell with pride at the compliment, for that she had done and all her training she had better be -the- finest officer in her field as far as she was concerned. &quot;Thank you Sir.&quot; she says, glancing to the others at her side &quot;I believe we are all deserving of such high praise&quot; **
** Trevor Vorhees felt a deep sense of pride as well but still remained silent. Best to not let the compliments get to your head lest you get too ahead of yourself. The ey contact remains, blinks occuring every so often. **
(62) Tegan Zadane: Tegan Zadane, sir. Trained in Intelligence and Technical Operations.
(58) Captain Narweld : Lieutenant Rue, do you think you and the others can live up to your hype?
(47) Kara Rue: Sir, yes Sir, though I can only speak of myself to that regard.
(58) Captain Narweld : Good answer&#8230;.and yes&#8230;my new Science Officer.
(58) Captain Narweld : Think you can run the systems on an Imperial Class 2 Destroyer?
** (62) Tegan Zadane nods, &quot;Imperial Class 2. Like all proper warships designed and built on Kuat.&quot; His accent said the rest&#8230;Kuati born brat. **
** (47) Kara Rue glances over to the&#8230;what was his name? Zadane? Science officer&#8230;she&#39;d have to remember him, he could be useful with ensuring away teams were safe and well preparied. Then there was the other one, the quiet one, good soldier, or maybe he was mute. **
(58) Captain Narweld : Excellent Lieutenant Zadane.
(58) Captain Narweld : And you&#8230;
*The Captain points to Trevor*
** (48) Trevor Vorhees took this opportunity to speak up with a straight, emotionless face &quot;Trevor Vorhees Sir. Helmsman.&quot; Short and simple, but there was an underlying tone of smugness about him. Faint, but it was still there. **
(58) Captain Narweld : Hmm, and I trust you are as comfortable behind a Destroyer as your colleagues are with their tasks?
(48) Trevor Vorhees: Sir yes Sir. Every ship I have ever worked aboard has felt more comfortable than my own home.
(58) Captain Narweld : You all sound promising, the recommendations I got about you all were outstanding.
*The Captain rubs his clean shaven face as he looks around at the diverse species of the Coruscant streets.*

(58) Captain Narweld : Ok, let&#39;s discuss our mission, and I do apologize you all being rushed into this situation.
** (47) Kara Rue spoke up, feeling like some leader of this&#8230;group..&quot;Comes with the trade Sir.&quot; **
(58) Captain Narweld : I know some of you might not like this, or be accustomed to this&#8230;but we are on a diplomatic mission.
(58) Captain Narweld : As Naval officers, expect to be the face and power of the Empire.
(58) Captain Narweld : Your value to the Remnant cannot be emphasized enough. 
** (48) Trevor Vorhees would have rolled his eyes if the Captain was not in front of him. Not another damn speech about a mission&#8230; **
(47) Kara Rue: say Sir do we know of whom we will be&#8230;meeting with?&quot; languages were something she enjoyed, perhaps she might be able to learn something new to be more useful outside her med bay.
(58) Captain Narweld : We&#39;re to have a consultation with various representatives from the Republic and the Falsoor Research branch.
** (62) Tegan Zadane nods in understanding. What better way to show fools the Empire&#39;s&#8230;forthcoming ascendancy then a show of arms. **
(58) Captain Narweld : They seek our input about a incident that has occurred.
(58) Captain Narweld : And our job is quite crucial.
(47) Kara Rue: Incident Sir?
(58) Captain Narweld : I&#39;m sure you are all aware of the Sernpidal attack by unknown forces?
(62) Tegan Zadane: Vaguely Sir.
(58) Captain Narweld : Well, intelligence is very sketchy at the moment.
** (48) Trevor Vorhees nods his head &quot;Only bits and pieces so far Sir.&quot; **
** (47) Kara Rue kept silent for that, better to admit nothing than to admit she didn&#39;t know. **
(58) Captain Narweld : So it&#39;s no surprise you are all in the dark.
(58) Captain Narweld : Apparently, there was a brutal attack on the world of Sernpidal, in the Outer Rim territories.
(58) Captain Narweld : Astoundingly, the aggressors were able to actually pull the local moon of Dobido into the surface of Sernpidal.
(58) Captain Narweld : Using a technology we know little about.
** (47) Kara Rue &#39;s look of surprise was noticible, they pulled a moon down? fasinating.. **
(58) Captain Narweld : An entire city was wiped clean off the planet, and the damage is estimated in 100 million worth of monetary value.
(58) Captain Narweld : Now, I&#39;m sure you all realize the implications of such an incident.
** (48) Trevor Vorhees started to feel slightly more uncomfortable with the knowledge that such tech existed. he was not scared or worried, but felt uncomfortably anxious about the thoughts of battle against the ones responsible. One could only hope. **
(58) Captain Narweld : This could be isolated, or something more.
** (62) Tegan Zadane vocalized his own surprise, &quot;How&#8230;intriguing.&quot; His tone carried nothing beyond scientific interest. That people had died meant absolutely nothing to the man. **
(58) Captain Narweld : But obviously we have taken a great interest to this predicament, and we must touch base with the Republic and Falsoor.
(58) Captain Narweld : Just who are these creatures&#8230;and what does it mean to us?
(58) Captain Narweld : This could be an utter waste of our time, but nevertheless our present task is to assess the situation through these representatives.
Captain Narweld : As the crew of the *Subjugator*, expect tasks such as these.
(47) Kara Rue: Sir will these representatives be human or be well versed in the common language? If they are of a different race I would like to ensure our crew will not be subject to..airborn bacteria that could be harmful.
** (48) Trevor Vorhees speaks up with curiosity. &#39;What are the chances of them asking us to go to battle with the ones responsible?&quot; **
(58) Captain Narweld : I&#39;m not sure, but expect foreigners when dealing with the Republic.
(58) Captain Narweld : And that&#39;s a good point, not sure I&#39;m interested in meeting their type Lt. Rue.

(58) Captain Narweld : Lt. Vorhees, not sure, that&#39;s what were assessing.
** (47) Kara Rue scowled faintly, great. Foreigners she didn&#39;t know about and couldn&#39;t prepare proper remedies&#8230;she&#39;d just have to give them the round of shots. Better safe than sorry **
(58) Captain Narweld : We are being the face of the Imperials, and utilizing this is a chance to learn about what were dealing with&#8230;and whether or not this is just an isolated incident.
(58) Captain Narweld : We want to mind our P&#39;s and Q&#39;s&#8230;we need to save face.
(58) Captain Narweld : The Republic will be watching us closely, watch your words.
** (48) Trevor Vorhees almost messed up and snickered at the p&#39;s and q&#39;s comment. Honestly, he sounded like his own mother more than a captain. **
** (62) Tegan Zadane slides out a datapad. &quot;Aliens&#8230;I don&#39;t suppose Lt Rue can dead one&#39;s nostrils for the duration of this encounter?&quot; He tapped the pad, &quot;I&#39;ll keep a log Sir&quot; **
(58) Captain Narweld : Use this as a chance to gather intelligence, and don&#39;t make any official stance clear to those within the discussion panel.
(58) Captain Narweld : We cannot vouch our position, is that clear?
** (48) Trevor Vorhees salutes immediately. &quot;Sir Yes Sir.&quot; **
** (47) Kara Rue smirks faintly &quot;I could, but I don&#39;t promise it will be a pleasent eperience. Get use to the smells on your own, I&#39;ll have my hands full prepairing shots.&quot; Turning back to the captain she nods &quot;Sir, yes Sir.&quot; **
(58) Captain Narweld : Ok, I know some of you are upset about the fact we&#39;re going in unarmed, but this planet still watches us with high scrutiny.
** (62) Tegan Zadane snaps to and gives a salute, &quot;Crystal clear sir!&quot; **
** (48) Trevor Vorhees casts a sideways glance at the woman named Rues. Like hell she would give him a shot. **
*The ensigns seemed very nervous at the proceedings, almost as if they didn&#39;t belong.*

(58) Captain Narweld : Ok, let&#39;s move out, and let&#39;s not try to look like a damn parade on Bastion while we&#39;re at it.
** (47) Kara Rue eyes twitch, unarmed now too? Well this was getting better by the minute **</span>

## Re: Play Session Logs

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-11-01 14:16:41)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">SESSION 2</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Captain Narweld had his fellow naval officers arranged in a loose formation, they had received a brief mission detail about their hearing.
He had just ordered his men to move out when one of the ensigns pointed something out to him.
(95) Ensign Tavek: Sir, aren&#39;t we forgetting someone?
(95) Captain Narweld : Whom is that?
(95) Captain Narweld : Ah, yes&#8230;another one of the men I have yet to meet&#8230;
Some of you began to question Captain Narweld&#39;s accountability methods&#8230;
** (95) Captain Narweld checks his chrono on his wrist **
(95) Captain Narweld : That man has no sense of military urgency&#8230;
(95) Captain Narweld : Despite the fact he&#39;ll be in charge of all our tactical systems and ground forces.
The naval team maintained their loose formation, still sticking out like a sore thumb.
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;My apologies, sir. Lt. Kava reporting as ordered.&quot; **
** (110) Kara Rue was looking about them, really this was not the best place to simply wait for a late soldier. Lateness in any situation would get us all killed and here they were, standing like ducks in a row. The woman rolls her eyes, away from the captain gaze of course, and over to the new&#8230;.person. **
(95) Captain Narweld: Where is my salute, Lieutenant?
** (78) Harlan Kava snapped a salute almost dropping his data pad. **
** (95) Captain Narweld returns the salute, with a look of supreme satisfaction in his eyes. **
** (111) Trevor looks to the Captain with a skeptical thought running through his head, his face stone almost and emotionless. His eyes move to the new individual; rolling his eyes as well. Any idiot knew to salute, but perhaps he was still waking up? He gives a silent scoff as the man salutes, and drops the data pad. **
** (110) Kara Rue mutters a soft &quot;novice&quot; under her breath at the poor salute. **
** (112) Tegan Zadane with hands behind his back, observes the scene with a detached sort of calm. **
** (111) Trevor leans to the side and looks as if to whisper something to Kara, but thinks better of it and just gives a cough. **
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;Had some last minute problems with the Marines on the ship sir; Equipment issues.&quot; **
(95) Captain Narweld : I guess you spent too much time in combat you forgot military formalities Lieutenant.
(95) Captain Narweld: I have some respect for that, just remember you&#39;re not just a field officer&#8230;you are an imperial officer&#8230;period. You follow the rules like everyone else.
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;Yes sir. I guess I still think like an NCO sir. I will try harder in the future.&quot; **
** (110) Kara Rue glances over to the helmsmen with a raised brow, hand clasped behind her back, legs straight and a rather annoyed look in her eyes at the mechanic..or whatever he was, she had never been good with learning stations. **
(78) Harlan Kava:&quot;Understood sir.&quot;
(95) Captain Narweld : Ok, without any further delay&#8230;let&#39;s move to our appointed place of duty.
(95) Captain Narweld : And try not to look like we&#39;re doing a 501st Honor Guard march.
With that, the group begins moving behind the Captain.
** (112) Tegan Zadane lets a small smirk briefly creep onto his face. **
** (111) Trevor falls in behind the captain, eager to get to the helm. **
** (110) Kara Rue smirks as well, dropping her hands to her side to make it appear more of a touring type of walk **
The streets, alleys, and passages were bustling with a multitude of life forms.
It was almost like a zoo of many different creatures to display.
Some of these creatures appeared to be grotesque by an Imperial standpoint.
(110) Kara Rue: &quot;Fasinating ecosystem of a melting pot of life forms&#8230;&quot; Kara says lightly, brushing a stray strand of sandy-blonde hair from her grey eyes
As your eyes scanned the bazaars, vendors, and cantinas;
** (112) Tegan Zadane can&#39;t help but let his smirk turn to a full blown sneer at the display passing them by. **
You could not help but hold down your feeling of disgust.
(111) Trevor: &quot;Aye I suppose. I pay them no mind, the smell that comes from some of them&#8230;&quot; Trevor shivers as he replied to Kara.
This was a sign of how life was under the Republic&#39;s democracy, on the gigantic metropolis of Coruscant.
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;I would feel safer if the Captain would have allowed a security detail. We are kindof exposed out here on the street.&quot; **
(110) Kara Rue: &quot;Scared are you?&quot; She asks with a smirk.
The creatures were tolerable though, as the hum of heavy airspeeder traffic overhead eased your thoughts.
If you glanced up it looked as if you were gazing at zipping star flies in the night sky.
The towering and impressive skyscrapers made you feel as if you were beneath greatness;
(111) Trevor: &quot;Not at all. Disgusted maybe, but never scared. Do not fear though; just because you are a woman does not mean you won’t survive.&quot; He says with a smirk. A poor joke but a joke nonetheless.
** (78) Harlan Kava turns to Lt. Rue. &quot;Not at all; it is just a precaution that’s all. My job is to see to the safety of the Captain and other Officers.&quot; **
As if you were hopelessly in the undercurrent of lost commoners.
You looked at each other, dressed in your pristine Imperial white dress.
Each member could not help but feel like a shining symbol of royalty in this crowd.
(112) Tegan Zadane: We find ourselves surrounded by the refuse of society. This is the proverbial garbage chute of the galaxy.
** (110) Kara Rue rolls her eyes to both men &quot;Men, typical in any form.&quot; she says with a sigh, looking up above them to the tall buildings and lights. &quot;Garbage perhaps, but every garbage pile has something worth study. Even in parts.&quot; she says lightly, eyes glancing down her nose to those around. Let the gape at them, they were better after all **
Despite the distractions, each military mind tried to stay focused on the mission at hand.
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;One can always learn something from every experience. As a soldier you learn to work with others instead of looking down on them.&#39; **
(95) Captain Narweld: Hey you all&#8230;keep your minds on the mission.
(110) Kara Rue: Sorry Sir.
(95) Captain Narweld : We have a serious investigation to conduct.
(95) Captain Narweld : We&#39;ve got a serious incident to deal with.
** (112) Tegan Zadane grunts, &quot;Oh even the lowest of beings can be useful.&quot; He frowns at the Captain&#39;s comment, &quot;Of course, Sir.&quot; **
** (111) Trevor looks to Kara with a pleased smirk that he had succeeded in getting an answer out of Kara, but feels his mind back on track at the words from the&#8230;.captain. &quot;Yes Sir.&quot; **
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;Of course sir.&quot; **
After the brisk walk through the busy Coruscant streets, you arrive at a fairly tall building&#8230;it was decorated with a white sheen and fancy lighting.
The F for the Falsoor logo was lit up like a symbol of excellence.
** (95) Captain Narweld turns to his men. **
** (111) Trevor leans in to whisper something to Kara, while studying the large building in front of them. **
** (95) Captain Narweld checks his chrono **
** (110) Kara Rue glances in a bored demeanor to the helmsman &quot;Not if you were the last man in the galaxy, and even then, no.&quot; **
** (112) Tegan Zadane raises an eyebrow at the two whispering to each other&#8230;or at least the one whispering to another. **
(95) Captain Narweld : Ok, good&#8230;we&#39;re still ahead of schedule.
(95) Captain Narweld : Let&#39;s go over this one last time, for our unorganized ground pounder.
** (111) Trevor winces with a sudden hurt to his pride but shrugs it off as his attention turns once more to the captain. **
(95) Captain Narweld: I want you all to present yourselves as the shining face of the Remnant.
(95) Captain Narweld : Establish hope in our representation, that we&#39;re here to help.
** (78) Harlan Kava Harlan was still checking the area they were in again. He was pretty much in charge of security so it fell on him to make sure things were going smoothly. **
(95) Captain Narweld : But do not overextend ourselves by stating our official position on this attack.
(110) Kara Rue: Yes Sir.
(95) Captain Narweld : We&#39;re dealing with a technology the likes we have never seen before.
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;Yes sir.&quot; **
(95) Captain Narweld : We need to determine the repercussions and implications this might have to our stance in the galaxy.
(95) Captain Narweld : And hopefully, this will have no bearing on our current standing.
(95) Captain Narweld : Falsoor has intitial ideas about this technology, but could it be deemed a serious threat to the Remnant?
(95) Captain Narweld : And if it is, will it be worth Imperial intervention?
(95) Captain Narweld : We will keep that part to ourselves, but we tactfully want to pledge our support to the Republic and Falsoor.
(95) Captain Narweld : Obviously, we&#39;re not at war anymore&#8230;so act as if they are in the Remnant themselves.
(** (110) Kara Rue listens to the briefing of their orders and what they were not to give away. Mostly she knew she would be silent in the meeting as there was more to be said with watching, than with speaking. She was good at that. **
** (112) Tegan Zadane nods slowly as the Captain speaks. Never speak up in these situations&#8230;unless directly spoken to. **
(95) Captain Narweld : Now&#8230;the most important thing is&#8230;who we are.
(95) Captain Narweld : We represent order in the galaxy; we represent the symbolism of excellence.
(95) Captain Narweld : Let&#39;s show this panel how greatness is achieved&#8230;through cunning and bravery to do what needs to be done. Are you with me men?
(110) Kara Rue: Sir yes Sir!
** (111) Trevor salutes quickly &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; **
(112) Tegan Zadane: Yes, Sir
** (78) Harlan Kava was still taking in and figuring the vantage point someone could get a shot off at them. He nods his head about what not to say. His role was to keep the tactical part of their mission under control and make sure the Captain made it back safe to the ship. &quot;Understood Sir.&quot; **
The captain then gestures toward the ceremonial stairwell of the Falsoor Annex building, and leads the group to the large durasteel doors.
** (95) Captain Narweld pushes a button on the door panel. **
(95) Droid Receptionist: STATE YOUR BUSINESS.
(95) Captain Narweld: I&#39;m here on a diplomatic mission concerning Ambassador Lobar&#8230;keyword restoration.
(95) Droid Receptionist : THAT DOES NOT COMPUTE; ONE MOMENT WHILE WE GET SECURITY.
** (95) Captain Narweld looked behind him, scoffing at the fellow members of his crew. **
** (110) Kara Rue frowned, lovely. She eyes the captain from behind, didn&#39;t they have a mechanic in their midst at least? **
(95) Captain Narweld: Droids&#8230;.
(95) Captain Narweld: Can&#39;t live with them, can&#39;t live without them&#8230;though they always make a mess of things anyways.
** (111) Trevor blinks with unease, hands twitching somewhat before he relaxes and smoothes out his emotions. Just what was the problem now? His faith in this captain was starting to wane&#8230;but perhaps it was just his imagination. **
After a few moments, some diversified personnel come out to approach the team.
(95) Security Head: Who are you? And what is your business?
** (112) Tegan Zadane has put on his game face: a neutral expression that betrays nothing. **
(95) Captain Narweld: I&#39;m with the Star Destroyer, *Subjugator*. We&#39;re on a very important mission.
** (78) Harlan Kava Kava attention snaps to and his hand moves closer to where his blaster would be. Thinking to himself. &quot;Damn. Wish I was armed.&quot; **
(95) Security Head: We&#39;ll have to search you&#8230;
Almost as to interrupt the security guard, a regally dressed Mon Calamari quickly walks onto the scene.
(95) Ambassador Lobar: At ease men, these are the gracious emissaries we&#39;ve been waiting on.
(95) Ambassador Lobar: We have pressing matters to attend to&#8230;so if you don&#39;t mind&#8230;this way please.
The security team gives you all cold glares; that might quickly create contempt in your eyes.
Captain Narweld smiles as his diplomatic immunity went directly to his head.
** (111) Trevor glares right back at them. One would easily be offended by their looks, so he felt justified. **
** (110) Kara Rue holds a carefully blank face but inside she was glaring, how dare they think they were better. **
** (78) Harlan Kava Kava does not back down one inch from the security guards. He had been rasied and train to never back down from anyone. **
** (112) Tegan Zadane could care less what the security team thought. In the grand scheme of things they were little better then insects&#8230;the non sentient or large kind **
The group is then escorted through the pristine white halls of the Falsoor Annex Building. It was obviously the administration section.</span>

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-11-01 15:16:39)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">SESSION 2 (Cont) </span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Droids and Falsoor personnel were hard at work, and obviously sophisticated technological research was happening in these halls.
** (110) Kara Rue glancing around at the apparent research or..some such, wondering just what type of things they had on those computers, what had they discovered that she had not yet learned of. **
** (111) Trevor started to pay attention now to the computers as well. Curiosity could be a dangerous thing but in his hands, it was a devine tool it seemed. **
 The doors to the ceremonial meeting chambers open, a long rectangular table seats a diverse crowd of representatives.
** (112) Tegan Zadane lamented the fact he would not be allowed near those computers&#8230; **
(133) Ambassador Lobar: Please my Imperial friends; take a seat.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: We have a lot to cover.
Captain Narweld had a big smile on his face, and sat next to a Zabrak.
The room was polished white; with red and gold tapestries. There were elegant displays of the New Republic symbols displayed throughout.
** (78) Harlan Kava follows the Captain into the building. He was not concerned with what was going on unless it was some new armor weapon system. His duties were all that mattered to him. **
** (111) Trevor would sit casually next to Kara wherever she would decide to sit. It would be casual enough to not be thought twice of, even though it fit in with his second agenda on finding out what he could about the female. Information on his associates was very valuable to him. **
The pristine nature of the Republic trinkets was enough to make any Imperial sick.
However, most everyone in the discussion panel seemed happy to see you.
** (112) Tegan Zadane took a seat near his compatriots; Ignoring but trying not to look like he was ignoring, some of the other delegates. **
Some members of the panel; seemed quite neutral.
Introductions were quickly done all around the table.
** (78) Harlan Kava stood behind and to the right of where the Captain sat. He also positioned himself with a clear shot to the door if the need would arise. **
There was Deputy Minister Shu Choei, a Zabrak. She was with the Republic. As was Ambassador Lobar, who was a male Mon Calamari.
** (110) Kara Rue takes a seat beside the helmsman apparently, and whomever else. She wasn&#39;t planning to speak, so it did not matter where she chose to sit so long as she had a good view. **
The representatives of Falsoor were two humans. Their names were Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant, a male, and a female Administrator Senior Joria Oria.

After the exchange of introductions, Ambassador Lobar starts the official proceedings, there was also a bronzed protocol droid observing.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: First of all, I&#39;d like to say it&#39;s great to have you all here.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: And tragic at the same time, because we&#39;ve met under dire circumstances.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: Let&#39;s start this off with some questions about each other.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: We&#39;ve learned that Falsoor is highly interested in the technology used in the horrible attack on Sernpidal.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: And as to how we can develop countermeasures&#8230;
(133) Ambassador Lobar: They are also concerned with restoration and aid efforts&#8230;through their bio-engineering technology.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: I was wondering though&#8230;how does the Remnant feel about this terrible incident?
Captain Narweld gestures to speak&#8230;
(133) Captain Narweld: Our deepest condolences go out to the people who have suff&#8230;.
Ambassador Lobar quickly interrupts Captain Narweld
(133) Ambassador Lobar: If you don&#39;t mind Captain, I&#39;d like to hear this opinion from another member of your crew.
** (111) Trevor frowns and looks to the Mon Calamari. How rude and uncalled for could one get? **
(133) Ambassador Lobar: Keep in mind, millions were killed, and billions of credits worth of damages.
The Ambassador scans the crowd&#8230;and points to Lt. Rue.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: How do you feel about this incident? You are a medical professional correct? You represent a very valuable field in a case like this.
** (111) Trevor turns to Rue and gives a silent smirk. At least it wasn’t him in the spotlight&#8230; **
** (78) Harlan Kava Kava wonders where the Mon Cal had learned the art of Diplomacy. It was rude to interrupt the other party until they said there piece. He was also glad that Rue was in the Jot seat now and not him. **
** (112) Tegan Zadane smiles as the question is directed towards the CMO. **
** (110) Kara Rue raises a brow at the&#8230;random.decision to ask her of the opinion. He had a point she supposed. She glances about the table before speaking &quot;It is a terrible loss, and one that would be quite devastating to recover from resulting no less in longer hour of grief and recovery.&quot; She takes a moment of pause, perhaps she ought to be more&#8230;emotional in this? **
The panel didn&#39;t seem to sense any sincerity in Kara&#39;s tone, she sounded like a cold-blooded Imperial&#8230;to her very bones.
The Ambassador looked towards Lt. Vorhees.
(133) Ambassador Lobar: Would you mind on divulging your perspective on this attack?
** (110) Kara Rue frowns faintly, what did they expect? She was a medic; detachment was what made saving lives possible. **
The Captain tried to muster his demeanor without looking nervous, but knew he needed his crew to help him out. Because it was imperative he didn&#39;t look like the only one who cared about galactic events.

He needed the other officers needed to look he like had genuine concern.
** (111) Trevor nods and clears his throat as he prepares to try and put on a better facade than the female next to him. &quot;It is a terrible business I must admit&#8230;one for which I can only imagine the pain and suffering that must be going on. My heart, as well as the rest of ours; go out to those affected by this terrible tragedy.&quot; He could have gone on further, but decided to keep things short. He hoped that that would appear sincere enough. **
The panel seems thoroughly convinced of Trevor&#39;s sentiment.
** (78) Harlan Kava speaks up. Trying to sound as concerned as he could. &quot;As Lt. Rue and Trevor have said it was a great loss and will take awhile for planet to recover from it. The attack was the work of Di&#39;kurts and they should be dealt with as quickly as possible.&quot; His words had the finite sound of a born soldier. War was one thing attacking civilian targets was not the act of a true warrior. **
** (111) Trevor purses his lips as someone had spoken out of turn it seemed. He braced himself to witness a possible retaliation from either the Mon Calamari, or their captain. **
(133) Ambassador Lobar: I&#39;m glad you feel that way Lieutenant&#8230;it&#39;s nice t…
The Ambassador paused at the interruption and so did the rest of the panel.
The Zabrak female especially scoffed in disdain at apparent lack of manners.
(133) Deputy Minister Shu Choei: What are you bringing up now, Imperial?
(133) Deputy Minister Shu Choei: Please state your position as we were listening to others&#8230;
** (112) Tegan Zadane shakes his head, never speak unless spoken to. **
The panel eagerly awaits Lieutenant Kava&#39;s statement that seemed so imperative, in a hushed and embarrassed silence.
** (110) Kara Rue smirks faintly, at least she hadn&#39;t been bad enough to do something like that. **
The Captain gives a quick glance of respect to Lieutenant Vorhees in the awkward silence.
** (78) Harlan Kava &quot;Nothing Ma&#39;am, I am a soldier and will apologize for my views. The situation was the act of cowards nothing more. The planets people need assistance that is what we are here for is it not.&quot; Kava knew that he had step into it boldy but at least he would say his piece. **
** (111) Trevor was slightly miffed that his praise had been interrupted, but nods politely and respectfully to his captain, before turning his attention to Harlan. **
(133) Deputy Minister Shu Choei: I understand your concern Lieutenant. But that is why we are discussing these matters&#8230;one step at a time. We don&#39;t want to rush the planning phase after the damage has been done already.
(133) Deputy Minister Shu Choei: Mind your place and we will get to the bottom of this more quickly, as opposed to just stating the obvious.
(133) Captain Narweld : Minister, he is just very anxious when it comes to saving lives.
** (78) Harlan Kava nods. He understood that the Captain may discipline him back at the ship but that was something he was used to. *
The Minister does not seem fazed by Captain Narweld&#39;s gestures&#8230;

Ambassador Lobar, in true Mon Calamari fashion, tries to keep a happy spin on the position.
** (111) Trevor finally clears his throat and looks back to the Mon Calamari &quot;As you were saying Ambassador?&quot; **
(133) Ambassador Lobar : It&#39;s good to see at least some of you are serious about these tragedies&#8230;
(133) Ambassador Lobar : It&#39;s very encouraging&#8230;and I know we haven&#39;t been on the best of terms&#8230;
Minister Choei watches Lobar closely in slight disgust.
** (110) Kara Rue had to work to keep from letting her eye twitch.
Her face was calm as ever at least. **
(133) Minister Choei: Excuse me Ambassador; there is something else we need to bring up before we continue the proceedings.
Lobar nods in agreement.
The Minister points toward Tegan Zadane.
(133) Minister Choei: You look quite educated, and reserved&#8230;I would like to hear your opinion on this.
(133) Minister Choei: And my deepest apologies for not letting your Captain speak out, but we have our reasons.
(133) Minister Choei: We need to know how every member thinks, not just the top ranked individuals.
(133) Minister Choei: It&#39;s all in good graces.
(133) Minister Choei: So would you mind a question?
** (112) Tegan Zadane speaks up with practiced calm, &quot;This is an unfortunate tragedy. It is of vital importance that we look to discover who or what caused this.&quot; The party line, delivered in his best diplomatic voice. **
The panel lights up with an aura of approval. Apparently, they were beginning to sense the genuine idea of the Remnant&#39;s stance. Lieutenant Zadane apparently had a knack for diplomacy.
(133) Minister Choei: I have another question for you&#8230;
(133) Minister Choei: Forgive me if this seems quite harsh, but considering our history&#8230;it needs to be asked.
Some of you notice that Lieutenant Kava has grown awkwardly silent.
(133) Minister Choei: There have been rumors that the main governing body of the Remnant is being controlled by the Moffs.
(133) Minister Choei: These Moffs have been known to garnish political differences quite often, and that it can often lead to drastic indecision.
(133) Minister Choei: Is it true the Remnant is in such affairs that the leaders can create chaos within the ranks, thus creating more problems than they can remedy?
(133) Minister Choei: All because of the power invested into the Moffs?
Captain Narweld tries to not look obvious, but he is watching Lieutenant Zadane closely.
** (112) Tegan Zadane lets a slight smile slip onto his face, &quot;It is true that the Moffs control the Remnant, however despite the occasional heated debate they are quite united. Particularly in matters of galactic security&quot; **
The Falsoor representatives seem thoroughly convinced on Zadane&#39;s position and so does Lobar. Choei, still seemed like she had a ice cold demeanor, but it seemed she was beginning to respect Zadane.
(133) Minister Choei: Now then, let&#39;s move on with the hearing. Our trustees from Falsoor have compiled information for us to review.
(133) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant : I&#39;ll have to say I&#39;m thoroughly impressed with your sentiments.
(133) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant : I feel confident giving you this information will benefit us all.
(133) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant : First of all, what do you know about the planet of Sernpidal?
The Captain seems quite clueless on galactic lore&#8230;someone would have to rush to his aid.
** (111) Trevor knew enough he thought about galactic lore to help out. **
The Falsoor representatives were gathering their datapads, full of relevant information.
** (110) Kara Rue speaks up to save her captain as it were &quot;Sernpidal is located in the Julevian system, third planet, main inhabitant Sernpidalian. One of the First planets and if my knowledge does not elude me, it was the most populated world in that sector.&quot; **
The panel seems amused at the apparent education of the medical officer. Especially the Falsoor researchers.
(133) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant : That&#39;s right, the fact that is so populated&#8230;shows it’s obvious why it would be attacked.
(133) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant : Someone wanted to deal massive amounts of damage, and to make a statement.
(133) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant : Which to me sounds like an act of terrorism.
(133) Captain Narweld : I don&#39;t think we can presume that just yet Chief Ardant.
(133) Captain Narweld : I&#39;ve never heard of a terrorist attack of that magnitude&#8230;and my crew can vouch for me. We were all in the Galactic Civil War.
(133) Minister Choei : Oh, you mean when you used to call us terrorists, right?
Ambassador Lobar quickly calms her down, as to not let the situation become condescending.
** (111) Trevor shifts in his seat a bit to get more comfortable, the tension suddenly getting higher again it seemed before Lobar eased the minister. **
(133) Chief Researcher Ardant: However, moving on, we&#39;ve gotten initial reports on the alleged perpetrators&#8230;and it&#39;s quite fascinating.
The Mon Calamari raises his brow at the idea of fascination in this matter.</span>

## Re: Play Session Logs

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-11-12 16:52:56)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">**SESSION 3**</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">*The discussion panel about the Sernpidal events had gone on for about 15 minutes.
The Imperial Remnant had done their best to keep a clear and genuine demeanor.
Some on the panel did not seem convinced about the Imperial&#39;s stance, nor did they seem too trusting.
Deputy Minister Sho Choei and Captain Narweld had just exchanged condescending words referring to the Galactic Civil War.
The tension in the room couldn&#39;t be cut with a lightsaber.
The Falsoor representatives do their best to ignore the tense situation, and look to Lieutenant Rue.*</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">
(40888) Chief Researcher Ardant: Well, shall we proceed now?
(40888) Chief Researcher Ardant: We must get to the heart of the Sernpidal incident.
*Deputy Minister Choei carefully scanned the naval officers.*

** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees had been carefully attentive, doing his best to not betray any sort of boredom which he was feeling or contempt for the proceedings. In his mind, blinking a few times, he was hoping this could all be over with soon so that he could get away from these&#8230;.things. **
*Captain Narweld did not seem amused in any sense. He was trying to salvage this diplomacy.*
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue sat straight, hands on the table folded before her as she looked back over the others at the table. She was bred to be well poised and officer training and sealed that in her, she was often thought of as stuffy or too much like a dictionary or medical text with legs, she didn&#39;t care..much, she did well, and that&#39;s what mattered, her gaze falls to the falsoor who were looking her way, holding their gaze as well. **
*(40888) Chief Researcher Ardant: ((Make a perception check))*
(40889) Lieutenant Rue: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [7,12] = (19)
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+10] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [16,10] = (26)
*Lt. Vorhees catches the Zabrak Minister looking toward the protocol droid and nodding to him. In turn, the droid walks back and pushes a switch on a wall console.
The Senior Administrator from Falsoor lays out a collection of flimsiplasts and datapads, all full with relevant data from Sernpidal.*
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees watches just what was going on and tenses, getting ready for anything that might be happening. Just what was the switch that was pressed&#8230; **
(40888) Senior Adminstrator Oria: Now, then, this is what we&#39;ve gathered at the events.
(40888) Senior Adminstrator Oria: As Lieutenant Rue put so well, Sernpidal is highly populated.
*The droid interrupts the hearing abruptly.*
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: Oh everyone, I&#39;d hate to interrupt! But we have unexpected guests coming through security as we speak!
*There was nothing more annoying to Imperials than blabbering protocol droids.*

** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees raises an eyebrow with an audible scoff. No doubt the droid had let them in. *
*
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue glances over to the droid, brow furrowed. A guest? coming here? and who told that droid it could speak? She sighs briefly and glances around the table, annoyance clear in her posture **
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: I assure you they are going through proper security shake down, and shall join us in a most expedient manner.
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: If my translation services will be needed further and dutifull&#8230;
*The Minister cuts him off.
The droid goes back to the corner.*
(40888) Deputy Minister Shoei: Who are they?
*The droid says they are two late members from the Remnant.
The minister, ambassador, and captain exchange formal security procedures.*
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees wonders then, if theyw ere late&#8230;how could they be unexpected? He then voices the question respectfully. **
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue &#39;s eye twitched, they were late&#8230;.at an important meeting. oh she hoped for a repremand. **
(40888) Captain Narweld: I didn&#39;t expect they&#39;d clear Coruscant Customs and Docking so fast&#8230;my apologies.
*Indeed, the Captain was severely lacking in accountability of his crew, and in turn was making you all look worse.
Deputy Minister Choei did not like this at all.*
*Ambassador Lobar, in the most noble fashion, calmed her down. Saying they needed to show faith towards the Imperials.*
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue didn&#39;t like it either, and turned her gaze to her captain, she was beginning to think that perhaps she might need to have a quick chat with the higher officers about this. **
** (40888) Deputy Minister Choei nods to the protocol droid, &quot;They are clear, let them in. It&#39;s imperative we keep things civil here.&quot; **
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees would just sit back, thinking as well that he would have a vote of no-confidence in the captain. This was highly unprofessional. **
*Two imperial officers walk into the ceremonial discussion panel.
Everyone looked curiously at the two new members of the hearing.
Ambassador Lobar is first to his feet to greet the two Remnant officers.*
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Stopping at the door to let the Commander through first, Yeliab quickly follows him through the door. Taking his place on the left of the Cammander.
** (40904) Commander Oturis enters the room, of average height and slighlty gaunt, he never the less holds himself militarily erect and almost marchs into the room **
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue turns her annoyed gaze to the pair, eyeing both with grey eyes, she had to wonder just who they were to come so late. **
*Ambassador Lobar extends his Mon Calamarian hand to be shaken by both men.*

Commander Yeliab is of similar height and build as his commander. his hair is dark and showing signs of graying at the temples.

** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees kept his emotions removed as he watches them for a moment, before keeping his eyes on the droid. Little known to any, Trevor had a dislike for droids. **
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab taking the offered hand, he steps back and examines the people present **
** (40904) Commander Oturis reaching out to shake the preferred hand **
*The Ambassador quickly introduces Yeliab to the people present on the panel after shaking hands.
The Republic Representatives were Ambassador Lobar and Deputy Minister Shu Choei&#8230;a Mon Calamari and Zabrak female.*
(40904) Commander Oturis: I apologize for the delay, Coruscant customs and security is not used to imperial ships in orbit.
** (40904) Commander Oturis turning to the captain, Commander Oturis crisply salutes **
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab with each introduction, Yeliab nods at the person indicated. **
*The Falsoor representatives were Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant and Administrator Senior Joria Oria. Celdge was a male human and Oria was a female human.*
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab gives a slightly deeper nod when introduced to the humans. **
*The two new officers only knew Captain Kev Narweld, as they had just transferred&#8230;the other introductions to the crew would have to be done on the fly.*
(40888) Captain Kev Narweld: Yes, this is my Executive Officer and my First Officer.
(40888) Captain Kev Narweld: They will work and help us through this hearing dutifully.
*Ambassador Lobar asks everyone to take seats and resume the hearing.*

** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees wondered if they really needed help&#8230;so far almost all of the interruptions had been caused by the captain. **
*However, Vorhees noticed the droid was still monitoring the console.*
(40889) Lieutenant Rue glances to the helmsman at his soft spoken words, her gaze returning to the captain in surprise and a hint of discust, He allowed his executive officer and his First Officer to arrive late??

(40888) Captain Kev Narweld: ((Rue make a stealth check for whispering))
(40889) Lieutenant Rue: [1d20+5] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [1,5] = (6)
** (40904) Commander Oturis takes his seat and wonders what exactly he&#39;s walked into **
*Almost the entire panel notices Lieutenant Rue whispering to Lieutenant Vorhees.*
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab Noticed the interaction between the two lieutenants. &quot;They will need to be instructed later.&quot; A mental note is taken as he turns his attention back to the board. **
*The Deputy Minister notices the whispers in the group and silently scoffs to herself.*
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : Without any further ado, let&#39;s proceed.
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue glances around to the others, it wasn&#39;t as though she said anything incriminating. As such, she simply stared back. **
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees could have eyed Rues with surprise, but in this occasion he simply says with a confused voice &quot;I am sorry, she was asking if I knew where the facilities were.&quot; **
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : Commander Oturis and Lt. Commander Yeliab, we&#39;ve been discussing the Sernpidal attack.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : In the attack, an unknown technology was used to drag a neighboring moon down into the surface.
** (40904) Commander Oturis looks intently upon the proceedings to he can get some sense of whats going on **
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : We were simply exchanging formalities before you arrived, and we were just about to get to the heart of the matter. So your timing is perfect.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : Do you two have any questions at this time?
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab Ignores the obvious lie from the Lieutenant and turns his attention back to the Ambassador. **
*The Mon Calamari says with a genuine smile on his face.
The Mon Calamari always were an admirable and honest species.*

** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab Shakes his head **
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: No, not at this time Ambassador.
(40904) Commander Oturis: Actually I do, are you sure it was an attack of maybe just some freak accident of nature?
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : It was an attack.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : The type of attack is unknown at this time.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : The vague intel we&#39;ve received has come just from Sernpidal itself.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar : So, without anymore questions, we shall continue.
*The Ambassador gestures toward the Falsoor representatives.*
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: As Lieutenant Rue pointed out, this planet is located in a fairly remote sector of the galaxy.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees acts like nothing had transpired that would have embarrassed him or Lt Rue. **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: This technology that was used, is unlike anything ever recorded in galactic history.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: And the attack caused the death of the Republic hero, Chewbacca.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab thinks to himself, &quot;Good&quot;. **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: So bare with me, this is almost speculative intelligence we are discussing here, as we&#39;re getting updates all the time.
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue held back a scoff, &#39;republic hero&#39; her ass. furry wookies..yes she knew about him, read up on the republic &#39;heros&#39; and what they had done to the empire **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Now, the reports we&#39;ve from the front, have a vague description on the perpetrators.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees blinks at the news that had just been given. How could they consider animals&#8230;heroes? It was boggling to his mind. **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: This species has, to our knowledge, never been encountered by the Republic or Falsoor&#39;s records.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: We need to go out on a limb here.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: And see if you&#39;ve ever heard of any species of this type.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: They are tall, with black or no hair.
** (40904) Commander Oturis raises an eyebrow at this, and listens intently **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: These creatures were dark armor, and carry weapons that resemble a staff.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab face and body remain calm and still. **
*Commander Oturis watches the Falsoor researcher closely, he seemed to be telling them honest information.*
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Their faces seem horribly disfigured, they are bipedal, and humanoid.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: And as I stated, we&#39;ve no idea we we are dealing with here.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees wasn&#39;t sure he had even heard of these types of creatures, maybe some tales&#8230;He thinks back in his mind to see if he could remember anything about them. **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: And they seem to have some sort of vehicle, that resembled a comet&#8230;or asteroid.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: It was a capital sized ship.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: The ships presumably transported the technology to the surface of Sernpidal to orchestrate the attack.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: So we can presume the vessels did not orbitally attack.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees had no recollection of anything remotely like this&#8230;he would have to take note and careful attention to learn what he could. **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: If this weapon is ground based, do you all realize the dangers?
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab believed it was probably just bad intel. These Rebel types are always poorly trained. **
*The tone had grown quite serious.*
(40904) Commander Oturis: While this danger may be great, if what you say is correct, then at least it is not instantly employable.
*The Minister nodded to the Commander&#39;s strong sense of tactics.*
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Yes, indeed&#8230;but a stealth attack is possible.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Considering the fact their vessels resemble a drifting asteroid.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Which is what we&#39;re assuming happened here&#8230;a surprise attack.
** (40904) Commander Oturis ponders for a moment **
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Our next question is&#8230;is why would they have such interest in attacking such a populated planet so far out?
(40904) Commander Oturis: Do you have any indications of what type or types of weapon could cause this type of event?
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: It&#39;s obscure at the moment, but the weapon seemed to be gravity based.
** (40904) Commander Oturis continues scribbling in his notes, these words didn&#39;t make much sense to him scientifically, but tactically such a weapon could have far reaching implications **
*Perceptions as a reaction everyone.*
(40904) Commander Oturis: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [17,12] = (29)
** (40889) Lieutenant Rue frowns faintly as she searched her memory for something that she had read or heard of, but continued to draw a blank. How strange..she wondered what these creatures were. **
(40889) Lieutenant Rue: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [14,12] = (26)
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: [1d20+17] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [13,17] = (30)
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+10] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [5,10] = (15)
*Everyone notices that the panel was taking thorough notes on the hearing. On what? You had no idea. But the Falsoor representatives seemed thoroughly concerned about the technology.*
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab Believed a combination of lazy sector security and poor eye witness accounts could account for this incident. **
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: My friends, based on what we&#39;ve given to you, what do you believe is the nature of this attack?
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees wished he could see the notes they were taking, he didn&#39;t like being left in the dark. **
*The Republic councilors were exchanging whispers..*

** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab Stands and holds up a hand **
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Yes?
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: I have a theory on this situation&#8230;
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Specifically the technology used.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Please give it to us Lieutenant Commander, that&#39;s why we are here.
*The room perked up at the Commander&#39;s proposal.*
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: The Empire has used technology similar to this in it&#39;s Interdictor class star ships.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab looks at the Falsoor employees **
*The Deputy Minister eyes snapped to the Lieutenant Commander.*

** (40904) Commander Oturis puts his pen up to his temple, this should be interesting **
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue glances to the commander, what the hell was he doing? **
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Is the incident at Sernipal something that can be explained using this tech?
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees purses his lips tightly before calming back down and just listens. **
(40888) Deputy Minister Choei: That is an excellent question Lieutenant Commander.
(40888) Deputy Minister Choei: And the best motion I&#39;ve heard in the panel yet.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab Notices the tension with his fellow crew&#8230; **
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab And thinks. You idiots. **
*Captain Narweld did not seem to enjoy the idea of sharing technology.
But that could really only be sensed by his crew.*

** (40904) Commander Oturis did not like giving out information without receiving anything useful in return **
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: I am not suggesting that we had anything to do with the attack, but the tech is old enough and for certain..
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Spies on both sides stole plenty of plans..
(40888) Deputy Minister Choei: Nor did anyone imply that Lieutenant Commander&#8230;the thought never crossed our mind. Why would it?
** (40904) Commander Oturis yes definitely interesting **
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab pauses momentarily, then continues. **
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees wondered when they would have this idiot sit down before he gave of the air of someone who had a guilty conscience. **
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Is it not possible that a splinter group has this explainable tech, not a new and powerful species?
(40888) Deputy Minister Choei: Yes, that&#39;s a great possibility.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab continues to stand; hands in front of him. **
(40888) Deputy Minister Choei: But how would one go about purchasing such expensive technology?
** (40904) Commander Oturis looks at the Lt sternly **
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue &#39;s mental list of what she would need to report was beginning to grow longer by the minute. Was this person even authorized to be speaking of their technology with an organization that for quite some time had been at war with the empire? **
*The Captain was almost glaring a hole through the Lieutenant Commander.*
(40904) Commander Oturis: Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves here, there&#39;s a large leap between the technology that both the republic and remnant possess, this is something that techs should analyze before we jump to any conclusions.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees gave a look to the captain as if to say &quot;Muzzle your dog, before he gets us into trouble.&quot; **
** (40888) Captain Narweld &quot;I concur.&quot; The Captain sighs with relief. **
*The Minister was watching you all closely.*
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Would a notion of collaborating technology be that bad to you all?
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: I think it is a gesture of good faith, to get to the bottom of this incident.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab point was made. he takes a seat. Ignoring the glares **
*The Ambassador interrupts the group.*
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: I believe such a motion is above our heads Minister.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: However, we can see to it that is pushed to the upper tiers.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: The head of each organization speak on this matter.
(40888) Captain Narweld: We reserve our right to discuss this with the upper echelons of our command. We seek nothing but to get to the bottom of this.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: I believe this motion makes sense&#8230;and would help you two who have bore animosity to each other in the past.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: So does anyone object on a collaboration of technology for investigatory purposes?
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: Besides our Remnant friends here?
*The Falsoor Researcher stands up.*
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: I believe we can&#39;t partake in this. This is between your two organizations.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: However, we are greatly interested in the conclusions you come to.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: So we are in disagreement, for the moment. This is completely acceptable. As this motion is above our statuses.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Well it is our choice to grant all members of this proceeding a much needed rest period.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Unless you all feel you can continue?
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees sighs internally with relief. A rest? Thank the stars. **
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Our droid here can provide you any refreshments you may want, and you may wait in this room.
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue had to admit, a rest would be nice, she needed a moment or so to discuss, clearence with the new people **
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: ((Make a perception check as reactions))
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: ((Do so in main room))
** (40904) Commander Oturis thank the force, at least during a rest the crew couldnt make a mockery of the empire **
(40954) Lieutenant Rue: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [5,12] = (17)
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab didn&#39;t see a point continuing with this discussion. **
(40904) Commander Oturis: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [7,12] = (19)
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+10] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [1,10] = (11)
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: [1d20+17] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [17,17] = (34)
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: OK then, we will leave you to your own devices at this time.
*All the members of the council begin exiting the room.
Excluding the droid.*

** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab stands up as the council leaves. **
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue waits quietly for the others to leave before her gaze turns to a glare and lands upon Yeliab **
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees remained just where he was. He was in no hurry to leave the comfort of the chair and decided tostay behind and watch the fireworks. **
** (40904) Commander Oturis As soon as the last council memeber leaves he stands * 
Captain Narweld: Well then, that was quite amusing.
(40904) Commander Oturis: Remember where we are, just because they all left the room doesn&#39;t mean we are alone.
(40954) Lieutenant Rue: Just what the hell is your clearence level &#39;Commander&#39;
*The droid approaches you all in a formal manner.*
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: Could I excite your taste buds with a little Jawa Juice. How about some Juri Juice if that does not entice you? Or, your throats must be quite parched at the prolonged hearing. How about some good old fashioned H20?
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: For a little energy, how about some caf?
*The Captain annoyingly responds.*

** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab ignores the droid and fixes a glare on the LT he hasn&#39;t been introduced to yet. **
(40888) Captain Narweld : I&#39;m fine thank you.
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue turns to the droid &quot;Water.&quot; she orders before her gaze returns to the male in question. **
(40904) Commander Oturis: I think everyone is quite alright, hopefully a little dryness of the throat will prevent any unwarranted talking.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the droid and asks &quot;You can answer me a question&#8230;what was the button you pressed earlier?&quot; **
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Who are you to question me Lieutenant?
*The droid hands a cool glass of water to Kara.*

** (40954) Lieutenant Rue takes the glass but only sets it down &quot;Answer the question, What is your clearence level.&quot; **
(40888) Protocol Droid: Oh that, that was a switch to activate the holocameras.
(40888) Protocol Droid: It&#39;s necessary procedure in any hearing.
(40888) Protocol Droid: Is there a problem with that?
(40888) Protocol Droid: Shall I turn it off?
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees relaxes and gives a shake of his head &quot;No&#8230;No certainly not. I was merely curious. Thank you.&quot; **
(40888) Captain Narweld: Just enjoy the rest, and gather your thoughts.
(40888) Captain Narweld: This is not to be taken lightly.
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue quiets immediately and turns to the droid, cameras? they had initiated cameras without a warning of such? and were allowing them to continue? She frowns, and glares at the male, she&#39;d have to wait until later. **
*The Captain tries to say this with the best smile he could, though he was clearly stressed.*
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Back down Lieutenant or I will back you down.
*Lieutenant Rue is unwavering by Yeliab&#39;s intimidation attempt completely.*
(40888) Captain Narweld: Calm yourself, Lieutenant Commander.
(40888) Captain Narweld: Not everything you hear is stupid.
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Sir.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees stands and moves next to Rue with a raised eyebrow to the commander &quot;I believe she asked you a question, that needs answering.&quot; **
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue looks unimpressed to Yeliab and stands &quot;I am Chief Medical Officer Lieutenant Kara Rue. If you plan to try and intimidate me do so when you can do something. And do remember, if you are hurt, you go to my medical bay.&quot; **
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: No Sir. Not everything or everyone, but there are times.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab ignores the threat from the willful Lieutenant. **
(40904) Commander Oturis: This is not the time or place for this, you all need to calm down we can discuss this later.
(40888) Captain Narweld: We&#39;re here to help these people. Is that clear? Not bicker amongst ourselves.
(40888) Captain Narweld: Thank you Commander. My sentiment exactly.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab turns to the Captain **

** (40954) Lieutenant Rue glances to the captain &quot;My question stands Captain.&quot; she looks back to Yeliab &quot;what is your clearence level?&quot; **
*The persuasion attempt may not be working against the Lieutenant Commander.*
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: Sir. Do we need to waste anymore time here? The council has told us they know nothing of value.
(40888) Captain Narweld: Be silent Lieutenant Commander.
(40888) Captain Narweld: That&#39;s an order, you are out of line. You will be disciplined on the ship.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees smirks at the Lt Commander though keeps the look hidden. **
(40888) Captain Narweld: As I stressed, we are here to HELP. You will get in line with the rest of the crew&#8230;is that CLEAR?
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab face goes expressionless and cold. &quot;Yes sir.&quot; **
(40888) Captain Narweld: Or I shall dismiss you to take the ensigns on parade drills.
*The ensigns watched the Captain quizzically&#8230;they probably weren&#39;t learning much.*
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab stays stands absolutley still and maintains his silence. **
(40888) Captain Narweld: At ease, First Officer.
(40888) Captain Narweld: Let&#39;s not embarrass ourselves any further.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab does as he is commanded without a word. **
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the Captain and salutes respectfully &quot;Perhaps you could answer Lt Rue&#39;s question then? For our peace of mind at least.&quot; **
*The Captain looks at Vorhees.*
(40888) Captain Narweld: Commander, how much longer do we have for this break?
(40954) Lieutenant Rue: Captain I believe it rather important to know the answer to my question. If his level is clearly not high enough he will need to be reported.
(40904) Commander Oturis: Sir there are 3 minutes remaining.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees maintains a stoic face as he looks back at the captain respectfully. **
(40888) Captain Narweld: Thank the Force&#8230;even though I don&#39;t believe it. I had better start doing it.
** (40904) Commander Oturis turning to lieutenant Rue **
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab listened to the continued interrogation by the two lieutenants. Amazed that the Captain hadn&#39;t silenced them yet. **
(40904) Commander Oturis: All you need to know is that its higher than yours Lt, so I advise you drop it until later.
*Just then, a distinctive incoming call chime was heard from the discussion panel.*
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue glances to the next one that had yet to be introduced &quot;I believe you are not the Captain.&quot; **
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: With all due respect Commander it was a question for the captain, not for you, sir.
*The protocol droid perks up.*
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: Oh, it is my duty to answer the HoloNet transceiver in the event Falsoor personnel is not on station&#8230;oh my&#8230;
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: I trust you all will not bother remembering any information you see before you right?
*The Captain scratched his head.*

** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees would not let this go until he had his answer. Though now he turns his eye to the droid and asks &quot;Why not?&quot; **
*Indeed, droids were one of the most odd things in the galaxy.*
(40904) Commander Oturis: looks at the droid and sarcastically responds.
(40904) Commander Oturis: Yes I forget everything as soon as it leaves my sight
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab continues his facade of stone, but turns all his attention towards the droid and the console. Perception to listen **
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: Great&#8230;then excuse me!
 *The droid pushes the switch and a stern looking man comes onto the HoloNet.*
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: [1d20+17] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [14,17] = (31)
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+11] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [17,11] = (28)
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: (Deception)
(40954) Lieutenant Rue: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [6,12] = (18)
(40954) Lieutenant Rue: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [8,12] = (20)
(40888) Flight Officer Radon Antila : This is Captain Radon Antila, Lead Flight Officer of the cargo ship, *Star Runner*.
(40888) Flight Officer Radon Antila : I need to speak with Senior Administrator Oria.
*The droid describes she is busy and can take a message.*
(40888) Flight Officer Radon Antila : OK, that will do.
(40888) Flight Officer Radon Antila : Relay the message that the cargo has been delivered.
(40888) Flight Officer Radon Antila : And ask her if she wants it in carbonite storage or static emplacement.
(40888) Flight Officer Radon Antila : Then have her contact me immediately.

** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab continues to listen. His thoughts turn to remembering anything he can about a ship called Star Runner. **
(40888) Bronze protocol droid: Yes Sir, I will deliver the message as soon as possible.
(40888) Flight Officer Radon Antila : *Star Runner* out.
** (40888) Captain Narweld looks around the group, wondering what was going through their minds. **
(40888) Captain Narweld: Is everyone good now?
*Almost as if to cut him off, the councilors began filtering back into the hearing.*
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the Captain and asks &quot;What do you mean by that Sir?&quot; **
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab keeps his demeanor cold and unfriendly &quot;Yes sir.&quot; **
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue crosses her arms &quot;No. But I suppose for now, I will wait.&quot; she takes her seat and makes a note to research the commander in the database **
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: I trust everyone is nice and refreshed?
*Everyone begins taking their seats.*

** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees fought the urge to mention what they just witnessed and nods his head in response. **
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab moves to a seat closer to the back **
*Once everyone is seated, the hearing continues.*
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: Now then, when we left off&#8230;we were discussing the idea of technology collaboration.
(40904) Commander Oturis: Yes, very much so, thank you
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: We concluded the Remnant reserves their right to consult their superiors before making a motion.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: And this has been noted.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: If we have no further objections, we shall let the Falsoor represenatiives continue.
*The droid passes on a quick message to the Senior Administrator, no doubt about the Holo transmission.*
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees watches the droid with anticipation before looking to the Senior Administrator. **
*The Senior Administrator excuses herself and promptly leaves the hearing.*
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Ok, on to the next motion.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: We&#39;ve established the attackers appearance.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: and the nature of their weaponry, though not comprehensive by any means.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Now&#8230;we should move on to discuss the motives here&#8230;and we will get back to the technology, mind you.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: And the nature of the species we&#39;re dealing with.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: It&#39;s also established that they are quite barbaric&#8230;
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: However, they are cunning at the same time.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab sits perfectly still, giving attention to whoever is currently speaking, but not paying any real attention. His thoughts are focused on the fact that all this talking means nothing without facts. And that&#39;s what they should be discussing. How to get more facts. **
(40904) Commander Oturis: Are there any documented species like this on any of the surveyed worlds?
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: By our records, no.
(40888) Deputy Minister Choei: We have nothing to report either, that&#39;s what makes this so grim.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: The biggest problem is that the information is hard to gather.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Sernpidal has become hazardous to live upon.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: As the atmosphere was superheated in the process of Dobido&#39;s descent.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: I can only hope this attack was isolated&#8230;
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees speaks up with a guess &quot;But what if this attack was only a test?&quot; **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Hmm?
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Interesting.
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue nods her head &quot;while devastating he could be right, this could have been a test run of sorts.&quot; **
*The Senior Administrator returns to the hearing, eager to return to proceedings.*
(40904) Commander Oturis: That does make sense, testing something of this magnitude on a world where you can inflict heavy casualties with little fear of reprisal.
*The Ambassador nods toward the Commander.*
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: Yes, that is why we must move quickly through this investigation.
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: The lieutenants are right. This form of single attack is a simple tactic used by any competent military. One single attack to see how fast and in what capacity the target responds.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: I concur with the Lieutenant Commander.
(40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab: It&#39;s loosely called Recon by fire.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees continues &quot;There is more, If I may continue?&quot; **
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: Yes Lieutenant?
*The panel eagerly awaits the Lieutenant, especially Captain Narweld.*
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: Based on my experiences in battle, this seems to me something that could be pre-cursor to an Invasion&#8230;It is purely hypothetical of course, but it certainly seems to fit.
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: Hmm, an interesting theory&#8230;
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab looks to the lieutenant with some interest. **
(40888) Ambassador Lobar: Based on what we&#39;ve heard, they are organized and can attack with powerful technology.
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue glances to the helmsman, a touch of respect in her eyes, she&#39;d have to watch that one. **
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: A bold theory I&#39;d say&#8230;
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: We still don&#39;t have enough information&#8230;
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees certainly felt some pride from his experiences in war, but maintained a professional appearance. &quot;Bold it may be&#8230;But it is certainly one to watch out for.&quot; **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Yes, but a good assumption is something to gauge with caution.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: It&#39;s either that, or a terrorist attack. But I&#39;ve never heard of terrorists of that fashion.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Either way, we&#39;d be unwise to dismiss this as an isolated incident.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: So I&#39;ll have to move towards Lieutenant Vorhees motion.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: And continue our investigation.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Are there any objections at this time?
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees could not help but to look around slowly, to see who objected and who did not. **

** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab remains quiet, knowing he didn&#39;t need to say anything. **
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue was silent as well, there was nothing to oppose. **
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Ok then.
(40888) Chief Researcher Celdge Ardant: Senior Administrator Oria now has something more for us, to describe the attackers.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: As previously stated, the neighboring moon of Dodibo was pulled down into the surface of Sernpidal.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: The atmosphere superheated, causing massive burning damage to everyone on the planet.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Not to mention the impact of the moon itself.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: As we are primarily interested in Bio-restoration, our interest is to send aid as soon as possible.
(40904) Commander Oturis: Do you plan on using a giant crane?
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Excuse me Commander?
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees had a feeling of where this could go, but quickly shot a look of dissapproval to the commander. **
(40904) Commander Oturis: To pull the moon out of course, obviously since its so large it may require some force to remove. Explosives perhaps?
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue looks to the commander, face blank, but inwardly she was sneering, he was making jokes. How he became to his position was beyond her. **
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Commander, are you being jest in this panel?
*The Deputy Minister looked on with great displeasure.*
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees hangs his head in shame for himself and the rest of the Imperials present. He then gives a look to the Captain, wondering how or why he chose this individual for this station. **

(40954) Lieutenant Rue: The commander does not speak for us. I do implore you to not think we are not concerned about this. Do we know if the moon section can be terraformed to provide life with the rest of the planet?&quot;
(40904) Commander Oturis: Of course I am not jesting at the needless suffering of the billions of inhabitants of the planet, but merely pointing out that what I just said is almost as ludicrous as the term giving &quot;aid&quot; to those same inhabitants.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Commander, there is such a technology as an envirosuit.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Now then&#8230;as Lieutenant Rue stated&#8230;
(40904) Commander Oturis: i&#39;d say an evactuation would be more in order.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Evacuation has already started.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: By the Republic I might add.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: But it&#39;s proving difficult to overcome the hazards of the planet at this point.
(40904) Commander Oturis: Understandable.
** (40913) Lt. Commander Yeliab could see this council was spiralling downward fast, but he was enjoying himself. Seeing the pompus politicians squirming n discomfort made him feel pleasure inside. He hated how politicians always talked about saving the weak but rarely did anything about it. Sitting in the lap of luxury while the poor die just a few blocks from their house. **
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: But remember this&#8230;
** (40954) Lieutenant Rue glances to the commander with a reproachful look &quot;Terraforming and ensuring the inhabitants can return would be the best possible solution to a species. Introduction to a new environment can prove to be harmful to a species existance.&quot; **
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Our information is still vague&#8230;we&#39;re doing the best with what we can.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Yes Lieutenant, but I don&#39;t think that is possible at this time.
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: What can -we-do then, in your opinion? What place do we have?
(40954) Lieutenant Rue: Of course not, terraforming and readying the planet for re-introduction will take quite a long time, likely the third generation at the least perhaps would be able to return, perhaps twentyish at the most depending.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: Well be patient Lieutenant, that&#39;s why we&#39;re having this meeting.
(40888) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: We need for everyone to know more about what were dealing with.
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees nods and remains silent for now. Patience was hard to come by it seemed during the course of this meeting. **
*The Deputy Minister speaks up in a serious tone.*
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei : So you do pledge your support then Administrator?
(40888) Senior Administator Joria Oria: Yes, of course. This is of great interest to us.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Correct me if I am wrong, and I hate mentioning rumors of this sort in an official hearing.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: But what validity is there of the rumors of Falsoor bearing illegal military grade weaponry within their facilities?
(40888) Chief Researcher Ardant: That has no bearing in this case!
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: On the contrary&#8230;I believe it does.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: I would just like to know who we are working with.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Is there anyone that disagrees with me on this?
** (40890) Lieutenant Vorhees regards the administrator now very closely, the entire video thing with the man and droid seeming to be more clear now. **
*The Ambassador and the Captain both concur with the Deputy Minister.*
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Yes, so please answer my my question.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Can you prove that you have no illegal weaponry in your facilities?
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Could you swear your career on it, right now? In writing?
*The Senior Administrator spoke with supreme confidence, &quot;Yes, I can.&quot;*
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: And what about here&#8230;?
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Yes, indeed&#8230;
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: LPO, attend to me.
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Arrange for me the appropriate documents I need.
*The protocol droid nods and executes his orders.*
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: ((Perception checks as a reaction))
(40904) Commander Oturis: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [4,12] = (16)
(40954) Lieutenant Rue: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [3,12] = (15)
(40888) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: ((Vorhees?))
(40890) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+10] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [2,10] = (12)
*The Falsoor representatives appeared absolutely honest, to all of you&#8230;though you were not sure.*</span>

## Re: Play Session Logs

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-11-19 17:02:48)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">SESSION 4</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The bronzed protocol droid took a few moments to gather the appropriate legal documents, while the group had a moment to speak amongst themselves.
The Mon Calamarian seemed to watch the Imperials with a slight smile, clearly hoping for the best.
The Falsoor emissaries didn&#39;t seem nervous one bit to have to sign such documents.
The droid servo motors whirred as he clanked up to the broad discussion table. He laid forth the flimsiplasts in front of the two Falsoor personnel.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Now please, Senior Administrator and Chief Researcher&#8230;review these papers and sign.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: You have to understand, this is just&#8230;.procedure.
The two representatives didn&#39;t hesitate and quickly skimmed the documents, and added their signatures to the documents. Along with an audioprint to an electronic document.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Excellent, we may move forward&#8230;unless there are any objections or questions?
Lobar quickly scanned the room with his fish-bowl eyes.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue made no motion to object in the least, only watched her counterparts quite closely as well as the others at the table. **
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Ok, we&#39;ll have one last review over the technology&#8230;and damages.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees made no objection either. He was actually looking forward to the end of this. **
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: The action to be taken&#8230;and then your stances on the subject matter.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Chief Researcher?
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve gotten some form of trust from you all.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane sat back in his chair with an unreadable expression. Well he had a smile at least&#8230; **
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: There is a bit of information we withheld at the beginning.
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: This gravity based weapon&#8230;
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: Possesses characteristics of a living creature..
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: It&#39;s not manufactured.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees was not prepared to hear that in the least. In fact he was shocked as his eyes went wide. **
(43549) Lieutenant Kava: Stayed where he was behind and to the right of the Captain. listening to Comm reports with one ear and the meeting with the other.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue &#39;s attention was back, it was living?? &quot;The weapon is alive? in what characteristics does it show life?&quot; **
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: Intelligence is filtering all the time&#8230;
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: but it could walk, and looked like it was breathing.
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: and Insectoid of sorts.
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: This unlike anything we&#39;ve ever encountered.
** (43547) Commander Oturis eyes narrowed at this, a bioweapon of this magnitude sounded incredulous, and he was interested but remained skeptical of what they actually knew **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane managed to hide any surprise he may have felt. **
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: So then&#8230;someone is using this as an attack pet?
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: That&#39;s we think&#8230;
(43511) Chief Research Ardant: and this pet is not your regular mynock.
(43547) Commander Oturis: So if this is some sort of bioweapon, then there remains the possibility that there could be more than one?
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: Exactly.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue frowns faintly, sitting back in her seat. A pet bioweapon&#8230;who was controlling it though? what source birthed them or programed them? **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava Was surprised.Thinking to himself. &quot;A living weapon? That changes thing more then a bit.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees blinks and shakes is head with a soft groan. &quot;These things&#8230;must be massive, and the fact that there could be more than one? This does not bode well&#8230;not at all. Are we sure then, that it was only one that caused the damage and destruction? That there was not one that was unseen?&quot; **
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: It&#39;s a possibility&#8230;
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: but all we can go by now is what we know.
The Deputy Minister was eying the Researcher closely.
(43555) Lieutenant Zadane: And do you have an estimation on the creatures size? Surely it was massive. How did whoever the thing&#39;s master get it into position?
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: Bait probably.
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: Quite enormous&#8230;by what we&#39;ve gathered&#8230;
(43547) Commander Oturis: So let me get this straight. The current theory is that some unknown species has developed an unknown bioweapon that used a gravity field to pull a moon out of its orbit?
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: Yes&#8230;
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: Fascinating.
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: That about sums it up.
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: and with Lieutenant Vorhees&#39; theory&#8230;
(43555) Lieutenant Zadane: I was referring to how it was smuggled onto a planet without anyone knowing. While this is truly an&#8230;interesting find, one must also be concerned with the implications that security on the planet was compromised.
(43547) Commander Oturis: There certainly are a lot of what if&#39;s in this equation, I would advise not assuming to much especially about an unknown entity.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue couldn&#39;t help it, this was truly fascinating to her and she was quite interested now, eager even. **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava Was now really interested in what was going on in the meeting. &quot;There is no defese that can stop a weapon like that.&quot; **
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: I agree Commander.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: We&#39;ll get back to your notion in a minute, if you don&#39;t mind to wait?
(43547) Commander Oturis: Of course Deputy Minister.
The Zabrak minister turned her attention to the Falsoor employees.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Tell me, what is your interest in this?
(43511) Senior Administrator Joria Oria: We wish to assess the damages, and learn what we can do to bio-restore Sernpidal.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: That&#39;s a little early in the game to be seeking that?
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Don&#39;t you think?
The Senior Administrator nods to the Deputy&#8230;seemingly wavered.
(43511) Chief Researcher Ardant: Yes, if Serpindal has been devastated to this magnitude&#8230;
(43547) Commander Oturis: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [18,12] = (30)
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Well, let&#39;s be honest&#8230;
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: The odds of the planet surviving now&#8230;are&#8230;very slim&#8230;
** (43547) Commander Oturis Clears his throat and then glances around to the Falsoor employees **
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Even for your capabilities&#8230;and I&#39;m sure you all are aware of this.
(43547) Commander Oturis: Excuse me, Can you tell me exactly what it is that your company does?
The Falsoor employees looked to each other, saying they just wanted to assist scientifically anyway possible.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: I mean, what are the odds of anyone even surviving? LPO?
(43511) LPO : The odds of survival from a colliding moon are 2,000,191 to 1&#8230;.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: So basically, all we can do at this point is assess what&#39;s already happened&#8230;and scan for life forms.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue glances to the deputy &quot;I wonder&#8230;do you believe it futile to attempt a try?&quot; terraforming a planet was an interesting idea, something she enjoyed reading about, but with all this talk, to think it was mostly for just that was&#8230;hm. disappointing. **
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Lieutenant Rue, yes&#8230;that would be the humane thing to do.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: But we must deal with this incident with caution.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue wondered again, was it humane, or was it cheaper. **
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: ((Make a knowledge bureacracy as a reaction everyone who just heard Deputy minister))
(43547) Commander Oturis: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [4,12] = (16)

Most of you got the feeling that the Minister was sincere in her statement, she probably honestly wanted to help.
But was apprehensive on dealing with Sernpidal.
The Republic rarely did not help anyone in need.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Now then&#8230;
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava Thinking to himself again. &quot;Makes sense. Wasting resoruces on something that may never happen was not something they shouldbe focusing on. A defence and way to stop the attacks was.&quot; **
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: We&#39;ll need a statement of intent
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: from all parties involved.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Then the ones above us shall plan the best execution and rush to aid Sernpidal&#8230;and gather any relevant data.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: All important motions in these proceedings have been noted, most notably the technology collaboration and precursor to invasion.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees wondered if this would be a time to mention the male in the video that they had seen during the recess&#8230;and about the person having a shipment come in. **
The Ambassador points at Lieutenant Kava.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: My good lieutenant, what do you believe should be the Remnant&#39;s action on this incident?
Captain Narweld looked nervously at Lieutenant Kava.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue turned to the lieutenant as well, this should be good, she thought to herself **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane turned to look at Kava. Sure that the next few minutes would likely be most&#8230;amusing. **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Figure out a Defense and where the attack is coming from.&quot; Kava didn&#39;t mind answering that question as he was a Soldier and this was needed. **
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Hmm&#8230;
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Well I think our first action needs to be assess Sernpidal itself.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees agreed silently, but showed that he felt like he should add something&#8230;yet remained silent. **
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: But true, we could use that intelligence to galvanize our defenses.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: So, I will propose this to you Captain Narweld.
** (43547) Commander Oturis tension reduced significantly, at least he didnt say go in there guns blazing&#8230; **
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Do we have the Remnant&#39;s support in investigating and possibly aiding Sernpidal?
(43511) Captain Narweld: Of course, but you don&#39;t mind if I consult with those appointed over me?
The Deputy Minister snarled discreetly.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Great!
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: And to our friends from the Falsoor representation&#8230;
Suddenly, the HoloNet transceiver began chirping, signaling an incoming call.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Minister?
The Minister activates the HoloNet transceiver and a Chiss appears in Holographic form.
** (43547) Commander Oturis Ahh very interesting, a chiss the commander thinks to himself **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue looks over at the chirping, again? another call? She looks over to the chiss on the screen with a raised brow. **
The chiss female was speaking in Cheunh.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the hHoloNet &quot;Another incomming interruption?&quot; **
** (43547) Commander Oturis Even better, a language he could understand, he hadnt spoken cheunh in awhile but his brain decyphered the words instantly **
(43511) LPO: The Chiss Ambassador states that is an outrage she was not invited to this hearing.
(43511) LPO: Her name is Aristrocra Neren.
(43511) LPO: A High position within the Chiss Ascendancy.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava thinks to himself. &quot;This can&#39;t be good. I hate not knowing all the players involved. It was like playing Sabacc without looking at your cards.&quot; The Mando part of him was growing tired of this meeting it was getting nothing done. **
** (43547) Commander Oturis looks around to see if anyone even speaks cheunh **
(43511) LPO: She also states that a similar incident like this occurred to them.
(43511) LPO: But it was buried in Republic records.
(43511) LPO: They were attacked by someone called&#8230;.
(43511) LPO: Turerenana?
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane steepled his fingers and lets a bit of amusement slip into his features. If what the droid said was true things were getting much more interesting. **
(43511) LPO: That&#39;s a word I&#39;m not familiar with.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: LPO, it&#39;s time you had a memory wipe.
The droid nodded&#8230;
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: Anyone understand what she said?
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks over to the Deputy Minister and raises an eyebrow &quot;Memory wipe? Why?&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava hand moves to his comm listening to any reports of another attack. This was getting more serious while they played at politics. **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue glances over to him &quot;apparently it knows too much.&quot; **
(43547) Commander Oturis: speaking in cheunh , I apologize on behalf of the remnant, although we were notified of this meeting last minute, you say Turerenana, can you explain further what this means?
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees leans back and decides to let the cat out. &quot;I might also like to say that someone had a message of a shipment come in earlier.&quot; **
(43547) Commander Oturis: I do, it means far outsider, although I&#39;m asking her to elaborate.
The droid, chiss, and Oturis exchange words in Cheunh.
(43547) Commander Oturis: She says that this has happened to the chiss before, by someone called the far outsiders but that the incident was buried in republic records.
Everyone watches intently waiting for a translation.
(43547) Commander Oturis: and she&#39;s angry because she was not notified of this meeting because of this
The Ambassador held his head low.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Tell her we apologize.
(43547) Commander Oturis: again speaking in cheunh, The Ambassador apologizes for your not being made aware of this.
The three Cheunh speakers were in heated debate.
** (43547) Commander Oturis turns to address the delegation **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue watches the proceedings with a frown, she understood a number of languages being confronted with this one and not understanding it was quite annoying. She didn&#39;t like not knowing what was being said. **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looked around at the debate that was going on and eyes Lobar, wondering if anyone was going to question him about what he had just said. Oh well. Their loss if they did not wish to find out possibly useful information. **
(43547) Commander Oturis: She&#39;s referring to an attack on Schess years before the Clone Wars, one of their capital shipyards was brought down to the surface in exactly the same fashion as this.
(43547) Commander Oturis: The old republic apparently ignored their pleas for help and buried the records.
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: That has nothing to do with us!
(43511) Deputy Minister Sho Choei: I hope she isn&#39;t holding us accountable for something so distant in the past!
The Chiss female, in her white dress uniform, did not seem to like what Choei was saying.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Regardless, we shall permit Aristrocra Neren in on the hearing, at least for it&#39;s conclusion.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Unless there are any objections?
Falsoor didn&#39;t seem to mind, and neither did Captain Narweld.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava goes back to his comm as this meeting was boring him. Thinking to himself. &quot;These fools are wasting time that could be spent figuring the enemies tactics and forces out not deciding who is to attend and who is not.&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue sighs faintly as she watches, things had gone from interesting back down to mild. It wasn&#39;t exactly easy to keep up with a debate in a different language, even if it was being translated. **
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: Ok, well this changes matters dynamically.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: This session shall be put on 20 minute break.
(43511) Ambassador Lobar: LPO, escort the Imperials to a waiting room.
The droid approaches the members of the Remnant.
(43511) LPO: Please, this way.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees sighs and reluctantly stands to follow the droid. **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue stands and moves to follow **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava thinks to himself. &quot;Finally! If I had to suffer these fools any longer I would have gone crazy.&quot; **
** (43547) Commander Oturis wonders why they were taking a break when they were just delving into the heart of the matter **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava follows the captain and the others out of the room. **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane takes his position with the congregating Imperials. **
The group is escorted through the bustling halls of Falsoor. The sterile and white walls of the building made you automatically think of high level research going on.
The droid puts you into a room with a circular, red cushioned couch.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue sighs faintly, ugh it reminded her of being back in a hospital wing learning. **
There was a HoloNet display for entertainment purposes.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Well, it went better than I thought.
The Captain sat down upon the couch.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the droid &quot;LPO, may I make a request?&quot; **
(43511) LPO: Yes?
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: When you go back, tell the Admiral about the shipment delivery that you told us to forget about. I believe that it is something that needs his urgent attention.
(43511) LPO: Excuse me, what Admiral?
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: Forgive me, Ambassador Lobar.
After a few moments, the Falsoor representatives join the break with you.
(43511) LPO: Yes, I will do that. Any refreshments for you all?
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue stares at him &quot;better?&quot; she asks, moving to a seat as well , crossing her legs with a sigh; the meeting was important but she was wanting to get to her med bay. She was sure she&#39;d have to do a number of things on board before they could leave, and she had research to do. She was about to comment on the meeting when they had company. holding her thoughts. **
(43547) Commander Oturis: Yes, actually do you have any Sarlacc Gut busters?
(43511) LPO: Yes Sir..
(43511) LPO: However it is quite debilitating..
(43511) LPO: Most human stomachs cannot handle it.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava walks to the farside of the room and checks the area over. **
(43547) Commander Oturis: I think that&#39;s the point&#8230;
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: I&#39;ll take two of those. One for me, and one for Miss Rue.
(43511) LPO: As you wish, I will make it happen.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue raises a brow &quot;No thank you.&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Corellian Ale if you have it.&quot; **
The room seemed to show nothing of interest to Lieutenant Kava.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks back to Kara &quot;Oh come on. At least enjoy yourself&#8230;&quot; **
(43511) LPO: Ok.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane remains standing, studying the others in the room, &quot;Nothing for myself.&quot; **
(43511) LPO: One moment, please.
The droid goes to follow his order.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue glares &quot;we are in a meeting still. and the most alcohol I&#39;ll ever have is a glass of well aged red wine.&quot; **
Meanwhile, the HoloNet had been playing commericals and a show about wildlife on Naboo.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Captain. If I may?&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Yes?
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees sighs with a roll of his eyes but says nothing. **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Why am I here?&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: You are the Tactical Officer&#8230;are you not?
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue glances up to the holonet &quot;I rather like Naboo&#8230;&quot; she says almost to herself &quot;beautiful architecture.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees sits across from her and comments idly &quot;It is a nice planet to be sure, plenty fields.&quot; **
A commerical comes up about Falsoor. About how they specialize in cybernetics, prosthetics, ecosystem restoration, and colonization.
And how they bear a proud seat in the Republic.
Then another commercial follows it, about a intergalactic Shock Box tournament.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue interest perks again, turning to the falsoor employees &quot;really&#8230;cybernetics and prosthesis&#8230;&quot; she glances over them all &quot;and illegal weapons&#8230;interesting.&quot; **
Hosted by the Bordo the Hutt Clan.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes Sir, But there nothing for me to do other then offer my opinon and get laughed at. I would be of better use back on the ship. **
Interested participants can jot down the contact information to be in a fight.
(43511) Captain Narweld: I disagree.
(43511) Captain Narweld: This was an attack.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Tactical information is of high value.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees actually jots down the information himself for the Shock Box, he was actually interested in that. **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Are you doubting your capabilities Lieutenant?
The HoloNet returns back to Naboo.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes,I agree but I have seen no Tactical data for me to give you my opinion of.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks around now, bored. Where was the holo-vids of the Twi&#39;lek dancers? **
(43511) Captain Narweld: As far as I could tell, there was plenty. And not only are you a tactical officer, you are the face of the Remnant.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;No Sir. I am a soldier. I don&#39;t take to politics well. **
(43511) Captain Narweld: You had better adapt.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Of course sir.&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue felt an odd urge to hit the lieutenant beside her, but held off with the comfort of needles sticking into his arm. **
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;"> :::SCENE CHANGE:::</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Sarin had spent a week and a half searching for the rumored presence of the Imperials on Coruscant.
He figured this would be the best place to introduce himself.
There wouldn&#39;t be that many imperials to deal with, only local law enforcement.
He had spent plenty of time searching in dingy cantinas and dealing with underworld contacts for this moment.
He was now en route to the target building via airspeeder.
The Sith flipped a switch within his airspeeder as he weaved through the clogged Coruscant sky lanes.
He had activated his emergency lights and dropped his vehicle in a sharp descent.
The angry airspeeder horns of the sky lanes were flaring up in retaliation at the blatant traffic violation.
He pulled back on the aviation stick as he went into a vicious dive.
The Cyborg opened up his senses to the Force as he searched for the rooftop of his destination.
(43511) Captain Narweld: (( UTF Check Sarin))
Almost instantaneously he spotted the large capital F on the Falsoor Annex building.
That was his target.
With a grim smile, he angled his airspeeder on descent. As the ship increased speed, he toggled the canopy open as the wind ripped through the cockpit.
The question was, did the Sith even feel the thrill of a hunt? Or had his senses dulled so much he was merely following directives?
He didn&#39;t put much thought into it, most likely.
On this day, he knew someone was going to die.
And it wasn&#39;t going to be him.
He was to gain powerful allies.
And soon all in the Remnant would fear him to do his bidding.
He would allocate the power of the Reavers and become Dark Lord
as his preordained destiny had guided him to do.
A question in the back of his mind held constant.
Who was this other Strife had warned him of?
Was it Elecia Ell; The former Jedi Knight that Strife had also instructed?
Or was it a Reaver?
Oh well, the Sith quickly vanquished these thoughts as he jumped over the side of his airspeeder.
(43511) GM Dreamwalker: ((UTF Check sarin))
He slowed the 50 meter drop by Use of the Force as he slammed into the duracrete rooftop.
The durable ultranium plating in his legs absorbed the shock completely as he pulled himself out of the impact crater.
(
** (43540) Sarin rose to his height and stretched his arms, he grabbed his great saber and began searching for an entrance, his heart hungered for the kill. He longed for it&#8230; **
** (43540) Sarin ignited his great saber and stabbed into the duracrete roof and began to cut a great hole so as to allow his massive form to fit through **
The massive lightsaber was cutting through the duracrete, however slowly.
** (43540) Sarin was growing impatient he withdrew his saber and called forth the force to strengthen his body and heighten his senses as he did this he slid over the side of the building and ran using the surge of energy to keep him upright and dug his claws into the side to help keep himself stable **
Below him was an amalgamation of lights, air traffic, and towering structures.
A normal man might feel fear at this attempt. But Sarin was no normal creature.
The Sith had to descend and find the mid level floor of the Annex building.
He began running and clawing his way down the building at incredible speeds, the Coruscant wind at his back.

Sarin speed was picking up viciously, and he stumbled slightly.
However, the Force slowed him down back into balance.
The Sith Lord held his claws steady as it was sparking down the building.
As his rapid descent continues, he looked up to see airspeeders passing him by.
He looked back down to see a small platform rising up to him.
(43511) GM Dreamwalker: ((Jump check!))
The Sith Lord leaped on the platform, leaving two giant footprints in it&#8230;
Then continued running down the building.
The Force alerted Sarin to his next move.
A speeder was about to pass him by.
(43511) GM Dreamwalker: ((UTF CHECK!))

Sarin stopped the vehicle with the power of the force, and leaped onboard.
He rebounded off the vehicle, and lept into a mid level viewport&#8230;he reached for a ledge!
(43511) GM Dreamwalker: ((Climb check!))
(43511) GM Dreamwalker: ((Recommend a FP))
His cortosis weave claws grasped the ledge firmly.
He was in position to strike, he simply needed to crash through the viewport.
While holding onto the ledge, he reached over to a passing speeder.
He gripped it with the power of the Force and sent it crashing into the Falsoor room.
The vehicle exploded overhead into the viewport.
Sarin was out of the blast&#39;s radius.
The way had been clear.

Meanwhile, the alarm began blaring to everyone inside the waiting room.
(43511) Captain Narweld: What the hell?
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue glances up at the sound &quot;what the hell indeed.&quot; she mutters **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees blinks and sits upright. Looks like the drink would have to wait. Instinctivly he made sure that Kara was okay first before checking their surroundings. **
** (43547) Commander Oturis thinks what now, a fire? this was completely unsatisfactory **
** (43547) Commander Oturis not to mention now he probably wouldnt be getting his drink **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane smirks, &quot;It seems our hosts have a situation.&quot; **
(43511) PA VOICE: THERE HAS BEEN A DISTURBANCE, ALL EMERGENCY PERSONNEL REPORT TO FLOOR 53 FOR A FIRE.
(43511) PA VOICE: ALL PERSONNEL REMAIN CALM AND AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue sighs faintly &quot;yes, we gathered something was wrong from the alarm.&quot; she sighs and stands looking to the captain &quot;Sir. we should do something should we not?&quot; **
Sarin crawled past the wreckage of the speeder, into the hallway.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava Jumps up from where he was setting. his first thought was to the Captain&#39;s safety. &quot;What the Firefak is going on her?&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: It said to await further instructions.
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: and I am a doctor. if there is a fire there is a chance for wounded.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the captain &quot;Since when does a captain take orders from an alarm?&quot; **
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: Sir.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Good point.
(43511) Captain Narweld: I think we should evacuate.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava hand moves to his comm not waiting for orders. &quot;Captain should I call in a security detail?&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: What security detail?
(43511) Captain Narweld: We have none of our own.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Let&#39;s get the hell out of here.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Move out!
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue nods her head and moves to the door, sighing as she would have to use a few medpacks for this most likely&#8230;unless there was no wounded. **
(43549) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;We could have security troopers here in a few minutes.&quot;
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane nods, &quot;I agree sir, this is not our concern. If we stay we risk being drawn in.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees seconded that notion and moves with Lt. Rue and the Captain, adrenaline starting to race. **
The Captain runs to the door&#8230;making sure the Ensigns go first.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue moves through first, stepping off to the side to survey the damage going on and the way to the exit. **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava follows the Captain. &quot;Next time I am coming armed.&quot; **
There appeared to be no damage in the main area.
People were moving frantically though.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Quickly, back through the main doors.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane keeps a calm air about him as he heads out the door. He barely even notes the others moving about, save for how much of a risk they may pose. **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava heads for the main entrance making sure the captain was not far behind. **
The group pushed through the crowd.
When suddenly, they heard the sound of durasteel being bent in half&#8230;and screams soon followed.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Once outside we will need transport.&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Get outside!
(43511) Captain Narweld: Double time!
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees almost stopped dead in his tracks at the sound, but quickly follows his Captain&#39;s orders. **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue paused to look to the durasteel &quot;what in the hell&#8230;&quot; she said, following quickly behind the captain at a run **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava wastes no time and follows orders. Moving as fast as he can out of the building. **
(43511) Random voice: Someone is attacking!! HELP!
** (43547) Commander Oturis follows close behind maintianing some space between him and the others **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees skids to a stop at the voice and bites his lower lip. **
The screams in the room picked up, as the sound of a light saber could be heard slicing through body parts.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane continues on at a hustle. &quot;Keep moving. This is not our fight.&quot; **
The group arrives outside at the main stairwell, where they had been security screened.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue paused now more &quot;wait&#8230;did anyone hear that?&quot; she asked, turning to the helmsman &quot;Did you hear that sound?&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Someone, seal that door!
(43511) Captain Narweld: I don&#39;t care who dies in there!
(43511) Captain Narweld: Quickly!
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees heard the sound and anything else but escape was soon quickly replaced by&#8230;.escape, but looks to Rue. &quot;Yes I did. But I&#39;m not letting anything happen to myself or this crew.&quot; He grabs her hand and yanks her in the other direction towards the captain. **
(43511) Captain Narweld: You should be able to magnetically seal it.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane gives another nod and moves to the door controls. &quot;A moment sir.&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: ((Someone will have to make a use computer check to seal the door and you can aid another)).
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava runs over to door and tries to seal it. **
(43511) Captain Narweld: ((Btw none of you know what a lightsaber sounds like))
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+17] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [1,17] = (18)
(43549) Lieutenant Kava: I will help.
The ensigns fanned out nervously.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue ran after but was the captain insane? sealing the escape? granted it would save them however it could certainly look as an act against the treaty to seal the door and not allow anyone else to leave! **
(43511) Captain Narweld: I want that door shut now DAMMIT!
(43547) Commander Oturis: [1d20+11] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [6,11] = (17)

The Captain begins fleeing the scene.
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: I don&#39;t know about anyone else but I have lost faith in that man.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees calls back to the captain. &quot;Sir, get back her now dammit!&quot; **
The massive doors shut&#8230;along with another layer of durasteel.
You hear the whir of magnets sealing.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava spins around. &quot;Where is the Captain?&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane turns and moves out as well, &quot;Evacuating, as should we.&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue frowns and points in his general fleeing direction &quot;he ran.&quot; **
The Captain was running into the crowd of passerby, making an obvious scene.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees mumbles &quot;Didnt even wait to make sure were were okay. Un-force-damned-believable&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane observing this brings a frown, &quot;With perhaps a bit more decorum.&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;I do not follow cowards into battle. This man has no honor.&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue sighs and looks over their group &quot;I vote the door to be opened. leaving them in there is simply cruel.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees agrees and moves to the door, biting his lower lip in nervousness. &quot;Lt Rue, ar eyou sure we should open it?&quot; **
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: I don&#39;t know what it was that was attacking but I would see this as a deliperate violation of a treaty if we didn&#39;t attempt to help.
The Captain and the rest of the group were now out of sight.

Meanwhile, you spot a glowing magma like substance accumulating through the magnetically sealed door.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane snarls and moves to the controls, &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid. This is the Republic&#39;s world let them deal with it. Our job is to preserve Imperial interests!&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue blinks at the glowing metal, stepping back and grabbing the other lieutenent &quot;I think they may have found a way through&#8230;&quot; she looks over to the helmsman &quot;I think perhaps we aught to hide or follow the others.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks suddenly to the other Lt and nods his head, looking back to the crowd. &quot;Where do you think we would be safe?&quot; **
The glowing hole was now getting bigger, and you could see a red energy blade sticking through it.
No one can act at this moment.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava hand moves to his comm. &quot; Lieutenant Kava to Subjugator. I need a transport to my location to pick up the captain. Have armed troopers with the shuttle. Move it people.&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue grabs him and runs &quot;anywhere but here!&quot; she says, moving off into the crowd. Lets see, if she understood normal society then&#8230;she links her arm with his and moves quickly towards the larger portion, resting her head on his shoulder &quot;best to act as natural as can be.&quot; she says to him. **
The gargantuan door creaks off its hinges and flies into the unsuspecting two Lieutenants.
The door sends you flying down the stairs&#8230;
(43511) Captain Narweld: [8d6] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [3,5,4,1,1,1,1,4] = (20)
(43511) Captain Narweld: ((You both take 20 damage))
(43511) Captain Narweld: [1d4] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [4] = (4)
(43511) Captain Narweld: ((Plus 4 for falling, and you are prone&#8230;24 total&#8230;did that beat your thresholds?))
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: (thresholds are both 20)
(43511) Captain Narweld: (You move minus one on the condition track)
(43511) Captain Narweld: (both of you roll 1d4)
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: [1d4] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [4] = (4)
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d4] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [3] = (3)
Lieutenant Rue feels searing pain in her arm.
Apparently, the bone was sticking out of her arm from the object hitting her.
** (43540) Sarin steps through the ruined door and stands to his full height, nearly 9 feet tall he was a monster dwarfing even the wookies of kashyyk. He searched for the one and saw that he must have ran off into the crowd. What a coward&#8230; **
Sarin spotted the injured Naval officers on the stairs below him&#8230;
** (43540) Sarin walked up to the two officers his towering bulk shadowing both of them.. **
(43540) Sarin: Where is your leader?
(43540) Sarin: his voice was hard and metallic and deep, sounding of the most horrid creatures
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue had enough time to gasp before she found herself down a set of stairs and a horrible searing pain from her left arm. Wincing she moves through a mental checklist of herself, head was fine, heart was working, able to breathing, minimal pain in breathing from fall&#8230;searing pain.. She turns her neck slowly, spinal cord was working &quot;hell..&quot; she mutters, looking to the bone. She looks over to her fellow then up to the towering form, blinking &quot;he..ran off.&quot; she says, hell why would she protect him. &quot;what do you want with him?&quot; she winces again, crap pain was intensifiying. **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees points to the crowd &quot;He went that way.&quot; Fear was in his eyes, and it showed greatly&#8230;but not at the voice&#8230;at the sheer size of him. **
(43540) Sarin: what is his name?
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: Narweld&#8230;.Captain Narweld. And if you see him or find him, give him a swift kick please?
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue nods her head and eyes the being &quot;hardly worthy of the title.&quot; **
You noticed some survivors fleeing the building around you all.
Screaming for their lives.
** (43540) Sarin strode off into the crowd and amplified his voice output.. &quot;WHERE IS THE COWARD NARWELD!!!&quot; his voice rang out in a horror undescribed **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees moved to help Kara immediately to her feet and took care to not injure he arm any more than it was. *
Meanwhile, the rest of the group was taking a breather in a back alley surrounded by enormous buildings.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue leans into him, wincing &quot;I need my med kit&#8230;or a pack so I can set this properly.&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane continues after the fleeing Captain. Noticing the distinct lack of anyone else following. &quot;Captain! You are an officer in the Imperial Navy! Show some restraint!&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: We need to contact the shuttle.
** (43540) Sarin sarin turned back to the two &quot;TAKE ME TO HIM OR YOU DIE!&quot; **
** (43511) Captain Narweld the Captain breathed heavily pulling out his comlink. **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Shuttle Thyferrian, prepare for dust off. We&#39;ll be there&#8230;ETA 10 mikes.
(43511) Comm Voice: Roger that.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane takes the time to smooth out his uniform now that they stopped. &quot;Sir it would appear some of our comrades have either disregarded orders or else been lost in the crowd.&quot; **
** (43511) Captain Narweld puts away his comlink **
(43511) Captain Narweld: We&#39;re getting ready to move out.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees moves and finds one of her med-packs and hands it to her, while looking to the being &quot;We honestly have no idea where he is by now! Killing us certainly wont help you though&#8230;we -do- know where the ship is.&quot; He needed to make a plan to keep them alive. **
** (43540) Sarin pointed his saber at the two &quot;call him now&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue glances to the helmsman and back &quot;if we knew where he was. sure.&quot; she frowns &quot;however, he&#39;s likely going to attempt escape.&quot; she tests her feet and legs and nods to the helmsman &quot;call him.&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Lieutenant Kava, call our stragglers&#8230;make sure they are accounted for.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Everyone else, fan out and watch for trouble&#8230;blend in with the crowd.
** (43540) Sarin was beggining to grow impatient &quot;then take me to your ship now!&quot; **
** (43547) Commander Oturis following the captain, he thinks to himself &quot; pompous ass, didnt even look back to check on any of us.&#39; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane stifles a derisive chuckle. What did he expect them to do if trouble showed up. **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees held up his comm and says to the captain &quot;Sorry to report Captain&#8230;but there is someone that wants to speak to you&#8230;and I would urge you to do it. Our lives are on the line here.&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes Sir.&quot; Kava picks up his commlink. &quot;Lt. Rue. We are moving out. Follow my comm signal.&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Ok, follow my signal all the way in.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue frowns &quot;I don&#39;t think that will help here Vorhees.&quot; she uses her right arm to track the signal on her com, moving off in that direction. **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees motions for Sarin to follow as he helps Rue walk to where the captain was. **
The Captain took a seat on some stairs, ignoring the festering creatures that walked past him.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Ok now.
(43511) Captain Narweld: All we&#39;ll need to do is get a taxi&#8230;and take us to our landing platform.
(
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Captain! What the Firefak is going on!&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: I wish I knew, but we are getting the hell out of here Lieutenant&#8230;back to the *Subjugator*.
** (43611) Sarin begins following the 2 small officers **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue continues on, following the signal to the others, glancing back to see the large&#8230;thing..following behind them. **
After a few moments, Sarin arrives with the other naval officers.
(43511) Captain Narweld: Lieutenants!
(43511) Captain Narweld: Urghk! What theh hell is that?
The Captain stands defensively.
(43611) Sarin: are you Narweld?
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;I can have a shuttle here with armed escort. We just need to stay safe until then.&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue held her left arm to her &quot;this would be a broken arm, thanks for leaving us. and that would be someone who wishes to speak with you.&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane observes the newcomer with subdued fear. Calling on his training to keep an appearance of calm. **
(43511) Captain Narweld: Yea&#8230;..yes&#8230;.yyyyy I am
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees only nodded in agreement and glared at the captain. **
(43611) Sarin: You die&#8230;
(43555) Lieutenant Zadane: Lt. Rue, he is a superior officer. Maintain decorum.
(43511) Captain Narweld: What?
(43511) Captain Narweld: Hey!
The Captain backs up nervously and trips on a garbage disposal unit.
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: he left us, and he is hardly worth the title of captain. Tell me did he even look to see if we were there? or if you were there?
You all notice the scene of Sarin approaching your Captain.
** (43547) Commander Oturis watches in horror at what the creature states, knowing that all of their lives were in his hands **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to Zadane and explodes as he points to Kara&#39;s arm. &quot;This is what our &#39;captains&#39; decorum got us. DOnt speak to us about maintainig any form of decency right now!&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;To blazes with decorum!&quot; He moves in between the captain and this attacker. &quot;Stand down!&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane narrows his eyes, &quot;One does not have to like a man but you will respect the position.&quot; His eyes widen a fraction as the thing approaches the Captain. **
Kava stands in front of Sarin.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue frowns faintly &quot;I really wouldn&#39;t do that. That thing he holds cut through durasteel.&quot; **
(43611) Sarin: Stand aside you pathetic worm&#8230;
The local riff raff of Coruscant did not seem to care what was going on in this section.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;I am a Mandalorain. We live for battle. I am an Imperial Officer charged with protecting my Captain.! Stand Down!&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane glares at the helsman and medical officer, then turns to the&#8230;thing, &quot;Do not threaten an Imperial Officer.&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava will not back down from the attacker.&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue sighs faintly and moves to take a seat motioning to someone &quot;does anyone have a medpack?&quot; she asks, rather uncaring of the captains ordeal. from what she had witnessed she had enough to report him to the higher command and have him removed from his position. **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees hands her the med-pack he had tried to give her before. &quot;Here&#8230;DO you need help with it?&quot; **
The ensigns watched the scene in pure panic.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava looks up at the monster. &quot;Give me a weapon and I will give you your fight!&quot; The fury in his eyes was real. **
** (43511) Captain Narweld watched as Kava held his ground. **
** (43511) Captain Narweld thinking this person was a real fool. **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looked at them all and was wondering&#8230;just how many of them were going to die for the sake of a coward&#8230; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue sighs and nods her head, opening the kit to hold the bandage. She points to her arm &quot;hold here, and here. you&#39;re going to need to pull down and over to reset the bone.&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Either give me a weapon to use or strike monster. I will not back down from the likes of you!&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane sets his jaw and bites down, &quot;Whoever you are. Stand down.&quot; **
Sarin uses the Force to propel Lieutenant Kava out of the way.
He takes 6d6 points of damage.
(43511) Captain Narweld: [6d6] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [4,3,6,3,3,6] = (25)
** (43547) Commander Oturis seeing Kava get tossed out of the way just reinforces his decision not to interfere **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane is shocked by the display, momentarily frozen. **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees helps does what Kara says, even resetting the bone as quick and efficiently as he can, while winding the bandage around her arm. **
** (43611) Sarin roars in retaliation &quot;Stand aside or you will all die!!&quot; **
(43511) Captain Narweld: (( Ok sarin roll initiative, its combat))
(43511) Captain Narweld: ((Captain narweld +10))
(43549) Lieutenant Kava: (I need a blaster.)
(43611) Sarin: [1d20+10] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [19,10] = (29)
(43511) Captain Narweld: [10d10] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [9,5,1,1,9,7,8,4,2,8] = (54)
(43511) Captain Narweld: [1d20+10] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [15,10] = (25)
(43511) Captain Narweld: ((Sarin acts first))
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue winces at the resetting, watching him bandage it with her guidence, glancing over she sighs &quot;I would really not do anything!&quot; she calls to the others &quot;he&#39;s far too strong!&quot; **
(
Sarin reaches out with the Force, lifting Captain Narweld off the ground.
** (43511) Captain Narweld Ugh&#8230;ca&#8230;..br&#8230;. **
The cyborg monster then pulls the man into his giant lightsaber, cleaving him in two.
The ensigns hid behind some objects around them.
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looked at the display in shock and awe. Yep. He knew now they made the smart decision. **
The upper body of Narweld landed next to Zadane&#39;s feet, lifeless.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava slams into the wall. His eyes go wide as something snapsand white hot pain runs throw his body. He slumps to the ground. **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue watches in an oddly sick fasination. what was that blade&#8230;it would make surgery so much easier..&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava rolls over on his back. &quot;Coward!!!&quot; He yells out. &quot;You would strike down a weaker opponit! You have no Honor!&quot; **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane sighs&#8230;now that the fighting seems finished, &quot;Well I suppose informing you that you are now a wanted man&#8230;thing is a bit of a moot point.&quot; He crosses his arms, &quot;So then, are we to die next or are you so assured of your skill that noterity in the Imperial Navy has no meaning?&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava the pain of his injuries can be heard in his voice. **
** (43611) Sarin roars with laughter &quot;ha ha ha ha ha of course I don&#39;t and you have no brains!!! ha ha ha ha&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;When I get to my feet we shall see coward.&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava starts to stand up. **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava he holds one arm across his chest where there was morethen a few broken ribs. **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane glances over at the struggling Kava, &quot;Do settle down old boy. I believe we are outmatched.&quot; **
** (43611) Sarin bares his might &quot;if you are finished then take me to Moff Reyis **
** (43547) Commander Oturis see&#39;s this was never meant as a standup a fight, more a show of force and an assasination **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Fight me Di&#39;kurt!&quot; **
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: let him fight, he clearly has a death wish..
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees was just watching silently now, not wishing to die at all. The captain was dead&#8230;why did they still fight? **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava moves slowly towards the giant monster. **
(43611) Sarin: If you have a ship then take me to it now, I need to speak to Admiral Reyis immediately.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane smirks a bit, &quot;Now why should we do that? You have already murdered one man, and unlike my comrades I find leading assassins merrily to there targets&#8230;well unbecoming conduct.&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;I am Mandalorian! The fight is everything!&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue sighs faintly &quot;idiot.&quot; she stands and looks to the others &quot;has anyone called for a transport? I would dearly like to take something for the pain and infection.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees wished he had a blaster in his hands so he could shoot Zadane&#8230; **
(43611) Sarin: ha ha ha if i was here to just kill then i would have, that man deserved to die and now as you know my strength i dont really see that you have a choice, if Reyis was my target i would have bypassed all of you.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava pulls out his comm link. &quot;Lt. Kava to Subjugator. Need transport with armed guards and medical to my location. ASAP.&quot; **
(43611) Sarin: take me to reyis i wish to join this.. remnant
(43547) Commander Oturis: Well i guess this makes me acting captain, I see no reason not to take you up to the ship, if you try anything foul up there several thousand storm troopers should be able to handle themselves
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue moves to the cyborg &quot;you wish to join us?&quot; she eyes him &quot;what are you? how much of you is mechanical and how much is actually man?&quot; **
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Disarm and stand down.&quot; **
(43611) Sarin: more than you could imagine&#8230;
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: shut up Lieutenant.
** (43547) Commander Oturis what a way to get a field promotion, he thinks to himself, I hope i know what i&#39;m doing, this being could easily kill all of us **
(43611) Sarin: if you think i will disarm you truly are foolish..
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees moves closer to the tall&#8230;thing, and says while his fear slowly abates &quot;Why do you wish to join?&quot; **
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue nods her head &quot;fine. I&#39;ll need you to report to medical when you have the chance so I have the opportunity to look you over more.&quot; **
The ensigns stop hiding as they realize the Commander was now in charge.
(43611) Sarin: i will be taking my own ship so i will meet with you in orbit.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava &quot;You are not getting on a transport armed. Nor the ship.&quot; **
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: Shut up Lieutenant!
(43611) Sarin: i never said i was getting on your ship you fool!
(43520) Lieutenant Rue: Commander do something about the mandalorian will you?
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane shrugs, &quot;Well then I have been overruled on the matter.&quot; He sounds more amused then anything, &quot;Lt. Kava, the Acting-Captain has issued an order.&quot; **
(43527) Lieutenant Vorhees: Do you really want to make him angry after what you just saw?
(43611) Sarin: do your subordinates truly disobey and show such disrespect?
(
(43611) Sarin: i thought the remnant had strength and structure behind it.
** (43549) Lieutenant Kava looks at Lt. Vorhees. &quot;Yes sir.&quot; The anger in his eyes is still there mixed with pain. **
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane glares down at the two, &quot;Foolish as it was he followed orders&#8230;initially, and stood by a superior officer. More then can be said of you two.&quot; **
** (43527) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to Lt Zadane &quot;I do not follow the orders of a coward.&quot; **
Both Lieutenants notice emergency airspeeders pass by the alley way&#8230;
They looked to be police speeders.
** (43520) Lieutenant Rue eyes the other &quot;the previous Captain had shown signs of insanity, which will be reported as well as a disregard to treaty and mortal life, a willingness to leave comrades behind to save his own skin. He would have been dismissed anyway. **
(43611) Sarin: who is in charge now here?
(43547) Commander Oturis: SILENCE, this will all be handled later
(43547) Commander Oturis: I am in charge
(43611) Sarin: Then you will escort me to this Reyis?
You hear the sound of police sirens&#8230;all of you.
** (43555) Lieutenant Zadane bites back his reply and turns to the Commander. **
(43547) Commander Oturis: Yes&#8230;.</span>

• (45693) GM Wokling:
• You've all witnessed the death of Captain Narweld to your great horror from a mysterious attacker weilding an energy blade.
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• And you've recently noticed emergency police speeders pulling up in the distance.
• (45693) GM Wokling: It's hard not to be aware of them as the group discusses their next plan of action...no doubt they where on investigation of the Falsoor Annex building attack.
• (45693) GM Wokling: ((You may act))
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• The ensigns made their way through the bustling Coruscant locals.
• ** (45713) Commander Oturis looks around quickly **
• (45713) Commander Oturis: we need to get out of here
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue glances up from the wrapping of her arm "Seems we have company." she states, glancing from the body to the others as she stands "lets go then." **
• (45718) Sarin: i will meet you on your ship commander
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• The police haven't noticed your alley way just yet.

• (45693) GM Wokling: ((Knowledge Tactics or Knowledge Bureacracy as a reaction))
• ** (45722) Lieutenant Zadane motions in the direction of the sirens, "We are the wronged party. But I doubt that will matter." **

• (45715) Lieutenant Kava: Tactics
• (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees: (tactics)
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• Most of you are thinking that splitting up would be the best idea...killing any of the police would not look good upon any of you...neither would getting captured. A stealh approach is likely best to evade back to your transports.
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• So blending in with the local pupulace might help...
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue looks over to the helmsman and grabs his arm with her good one "Come on you, might as well continue our little charade." **
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• You might also be forced to kill some patrolman, but only when absolutely necessary.
• ** (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to Kara and nods silently as he places an arm around her, going to play the charade of the happy couple. **
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• Sarin has the left the group, disappearing into the crowd.

• (45693) GM Wokling:
• He was heading into the bustling Bazaar and stores section.
• ** (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees does as suggested quickly, and helps Kara. **
• (45713) Commander Oturis: (blouse = jacket)
• ** (45722) Lieutenant Zadane nods, "It would add to our problems but securing entirely new clothes would be better." **
• (45693) GM Wokling: ((Remember, limit your PM's they are buggy))
• ** (45715) Lieutenant Kava That is going to be a problem sir. Think he cracked some ribs. **
• (45727) Atrilla (exit): 13:21
• (45693) GM Wokling:
• You have your own shuttle, and Sarin has his infiltrator.
• (45693) GM Wokling: ((Perception as a reaction)).
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue was rather glad for the help, turning in a small circle to allow him to better take the jacket from her. Adjusting the top underneath she frowns and looks to him "Come on, we can find a store for a quick moment, I have credits on me." She nods to the others "we'll meet you back to the ship then." **
• (45713) Commander Oturis: alright split up into pairs, kava your with me, zadane and yeliab and rue and vorhee's, try to find some alternate clothing and meet back at the ship in 20 mikes

• ** (45715) Lieutenant Kava starts to move toward the commander. **
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue grabs hold of the helmsman and begins walking without another word, smiling lightly as she looks up to him, better to act the part so to speak, leading the way towards the market **
• ** (45693) Ensign Torker Sir, they are over there...motioning discreetly. **
• ** (45713) Commander Oturis walks in the general direction of the patrolmen, waving the others to continue on with the plan **
• ** (45715) Lieutenant Kava May I suggest that we stay off our comms as well. **
• (45693) Ensign Torker:
• The Commander moves toward the patrolman, everyone else heads to through the heavily active back alley.

• (45693) Ensign Torker: What's he doing Sirs?
• ** (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees moves with the other Lieutenant and smiles as he even nuzzles against her cheek as they walk. **

• (45693) Duros Patrolman:
• the other human patrolman looked quite nervous
• ** (45713) Commander Oturis looking at the patrolment **
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: Hands where I can see them!
• (45713) Commander Oturis: oh thank goodness you've arrived, i need to get my friend here to a medbay he's been hurt!!!
• ** (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees had no clue who the patrolman was talking to, seeing as they did not give a description, and just continued to act casually. **
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!!!
• (45713) Commander Oturis: [1d20+11] <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> [20,11] = (31)
• (45713) Commander Oturis: persuasion
• (45713) Commander Oturis: puts my hands up
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: Ok, we'll look at him.
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue ignored them as well, for all they knew it could have been the others, she retained a casual air, to not alert sucpision, just another couple heading off for shopping with a broken arm. **
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: Just remain calm...keep your hands out...there has been a reported assault.
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: We're going to search you.
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: Both of you lie on your stomachs...
• ** (45713) Commander Oturis does what the patrolmen says **
• (45693) Duros Patrolman:
• The rest of you are casually strolling through the marketplace, experiencing no problems.
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: You sir! DOWN!
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue glances around her, looking for a clothing spot for more civillian like items. **
• (45713) Commander Oturis: kava do as the patrolmen ask, i know your in pain, but their just doing their jobs

• (45693) Duros Patrolman:
• Rue spots the Coruscant Aristocrat store.
• ** (45715) Lieutenant Kava responds to the Officer request. **
• ** (45722) Lieutenant Zadane does a quick visual check for any patrolman in the area and then for any place he can secure a street map. **
• (45693) Duros Patrolman:
• The duros moves foward to search Kava first.
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue smirks faintly and idly pulls the helmsman towards it, of all things that ever looked like a normal 'couple' watching an excited woman vear off dragging her man with her to a clothing store had to be the most normal of normal. Stepping in the human moves straight to the womens side. **
• ** (45693) Duros Patrolman searches Kava. **
• (45713) Commander Oturis: be careful i fear he's pretty badly wounded, the door that flew off across the street struck him badly

• (45693) Duros Patrolman: No weapons on him.
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: Call a paramedic Ruus.
• ** (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees was caught off-guard by the sudden pull but holds her good arm close and smiles as he says "Alright love...what looks good for you?" **
• (45693) Duros Patrolman:
• The human nods.
• (45693) Duros Patrolman:
• Zadane is able to find a street map for 5 credits, and sees no patrolman in the area.
• (45693) Duros Patrolman: Sir, for your safety and mine...I will have to detain you with binders.
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue glances to him with a 'you're kidding me' look but forces a smile "Let me try a few things on...dear." picking out pants, skirts, and tops she moves off to try on, motioning him to the store " ithink you should find something nice too." **

• (45693) Duros Patrolman: True...
• ** (45693) Duros Patrolman moves over to Commander Oturis. **
• ** (45722) Lieutenant Zadane drops the five credits, then smiles at the stre owner, "I don't suppose you would help a new comer to the city out? You know good places to eat and shop. Any good taxi companys or speeder rentals?" **
• ** (45715) Lieutenant Kava looking at the officer. "Binders?! I have broken ribs fool! I will not run you have my word.' **
• ** (45693) Duros Patrolman searches Commander Oturis. **
• ** (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees laughs at the look but does not move from his spot near her. He wanted to make sure that should anything happen to the woman, that he would be able to help. **

• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue tries various mixtures of clothing, typical really, even in the military she was still female and still enjoyed clothing and shopping. Deciding on a skirt, shirt and vest combination she exits holding her old clothes and wearing the new, wincing faintly "now I know the difficulties of a broken arm and dressing." she nods to him "your turn, or would you like me to pick things out?" **

• (45693) Droid Paramedic : He does not need medical treatment, other than some pain medicine.
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue smirks and moves off, handing him her uniform clothing as she moves around the store, picking out tops, vests, button downs, pants, and for good measure a hat. Pointing him to the dressing room she sets the clothing in, and takes her clothing to wait. **

• ** (45719) Lieutenant Vorhees nods his head and strips off the shirt he was wearing and grabs the brown, and places it on himself in front of her before wearing the hat. "Now?" **
• (45693) Duro Patrolman:
• The aristocrat clothing was quite expensive, at any rate.
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue nods her head, moving into the room to grab his uniform before moving up to the front "How much for what we are wearing?" **
• ** (45715) Lieutenant Kava looks at the officer then to his commander. Thinking. "No honor at all in this man. How does the republic expect to keep order with men like this one." **

• (45693) GM Wokling: ((Deduct 200 credits and Oturis 3000.))
• ** (45705) Lieutenant Rue awaits the bag to stuff the uniforms in, handing it to the helmsman and then takes his arm "Shall we?" she pauses and looks to the droid "by the way, where's the nearest taxi stand." **
• (45693) Shop droid: Just keep going on down...and look for a terminal.
• (45693) Shop droid: Should give you all directions.

• ** (45722) Lieutenant Zadane calmly walks out and tries to flag down a taxi. **
• ** (45715) Lieutenant Kava under his breath, "Damn! Now I know why father said to be a Merc." **

• By the way, Oturis and Kava retain all their possessions.
