On the newly acquired yet used YT-1300, Talon, Stragos, EX, Galen and Kyle are following the last inputted hyperspace coordinates provided by Lucien. Lucien, Al'verde, Matsuun and Raik with the slightly faster hyperspace engine arrive first. The first jump only takes about a couple hours before once more you all are in real space.
The system Lucien has brought you to from what you can tell on sensors is uninhabited. A space dust cloud orbits around the dying sun.

**A side RP done in the chat room between Raik and Al'verde. Feel free to react off of it.**
Raik has found a small corner of the Firespray cargohold. Where she's working on finishing her new lightsaber. She hasn't said anything to the mandalorians, and only saught out Lucien when she needed something.
Alverde walked into the cargo hold and grabbed his wieghts. As he looked around he spotted Raik and smiled "So what are you working on there? Nedd any help I'm pretty good with a wrench."
Raik rolled her eyes, but bit back the first comments that came to mind. She was trying to be as civil as she could manage. "I'm building a new lightsaber." She then moves to collect the parts to leave.
Alverde shruged "Hey there's more than enough room for the both of us here. Look if you want you space that's fine. I'm just intrested to see what life is like on the other side of the spectrem, but I'm not going to push it" he said as he walked away "If you need anything let me know."
Raiks stopped, and turned to look at him. This is the one that Denia had selected to be her keeper while away from the Resurgence. "Ask your questions then."
Alverde turned back around "Well it's more I just wanted to talk to you. See what it was that made you want to help Draco. See I've always held the jedi in high regard. I'm just interested in see what your point of view is."
Raik raised an eyebrow at the question. "So you want to hear my story? Very well. I dared to fall in love with a fellow student. He didn't return my affection, and I was cast out of the order."
"I'm sorry to hear that. I've never had time for love myself, I had a fmaily name to live up to
once my father died. So I went off to find a war and what not."
"So did you join Draco just to get back at the jedi?"
"Then its true, You Mandalorians are all about violence and glory." Raik replied, "After I heard
about the Jedi Rebellion, I traveled to Courasant. I wasn't sure if I wanted to thank or kill those who decimated
the Jedi Order, but ran into Valin. Who asked me to join him. I hated the Jedi. and he gave me a chance to hunt them."
Alverde sighed "We're not all about violence. So clans are more about blood shed, however if I was all about
violence I would have no issues about..well I would have carried out order 66. You see for my family honor is
first."
"And why didn't you? Did you see they were just as corrupt as the politicians?"
"Because that act itself, my father would never have been able to look at me had he still been
around. If I have to pick between my life and my honor I will always pick my honor." he said looking Raik after
her corrupt remark "That didn't matter. I had already said that I would fight fo them. If I have to carry out an order
that I don't like that's something that I'll have to deal with in the field. Besides I didn't see any reason to trade one
politician for another."
Raik glared at hi,, she had little to say to someone that felt the slaughter of the Jedi was wrong.
"They passed judgment on others without the right, they stole children from they're families. No we're better off
without them."
"That may be tru but as a solider it's not my place to judge. I must follow my orders...unless it puts my honor at risk."
"How very short sighted of you." Raik replied, turning and leaving.
Alverde sighed "You know I'm not the only one here short sighted. You're convinced that your way is the only
way. You're refusing to even look at things from a different angle." he said as he started working out
"Why? I have no "Family honor" to fall back on as an excuse. I don't need to look at things
differently."
"Because the world is a bit bigger than your own personal views."
"And how would that change anything?"
"That's not my call. you have to figure that out on your own. Think about what is most
important to you in life and I'll help you out. If all you really want to do is kill jedi I'll help you find them but that's
about it."
That seamed to strike a nerve with Raik, as she summoned something to her hand though the
Force, that she then threw at Al. "Your no better then the Jedi Hag! I don't know. I Don't Know. There! I admit it,
Happy!?!"
Alverde looked at Raik "No that's not what I wanted. I'm sorry I was trying to help. I didn't mean to make you
angry, I have to remember that I was raised on a toughed life style than most."
Raik wasn't quite ready yet to calm down, clutching the unfinished lightsaber to her chest, as if it
was the most precious thing to her. "I didn't ask you to help!" She then stormed out of the cargo hold heading to
her quarters.
Alverde rolled his eyes "All women are the same. They have no idea waht the want, all they know is that the guy
they are talking to is wrong."

Lucien is extremely busy trying to devise the most complicated jump route he can to the planetary system he is leading everyone toward. However at the same time he doesn't want to increase the journey time by anymore then he has to. Juggling all of the variables is extremely complicated so except when Raik needs his help he is too occupied to be paying much attention to what is going on around him.
He has no intention of heading to bed for some rest until he has got the list of jump coordinates finalised.

Kyle unsure about the logic of the other team about brining Raik, still maybe there is hope for her. Kyle remembers the story about Ulic and that he was able to redeem himself. Sitting in the co-pilot chair he monitors the sensor system.

## Episode 31

### **Alicia** (2009-06-14 11:22:00)

[Transcript](http://dod.swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47:episode-31&catid=9:dod-5&Itemid=38 "http://dod.swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47:episode-31&catid=9:dod-5&Itemid=38")
Lucien has brought everyone to the planet Narash where his family, apparently a prominent noble family, reside in the largest of the cities, Aleria. Here they meet Eric and Marian, Lucien's parents as well as his brothers, Arnold and Richard.The first meeting with Lord Eric Devereux was interrupted by the Imperial Envoy who was insisting to have imperative business with the lord. Once the Envoy had been escorted out, during with Captain Kendra did a double take at Galen, Lord Devereux insisted on having everyone stay on the estate and join the family for dinner.
Making yourselves comfortable you spent the remainder of your day and evening as guests of the house.
Meanwhile J9 had slipped out of the house in pursuit of the Imperial Envoy. Having lost them in the city he proceeded to seek out rumors about them. It didn't take him long to learn they had been granted an embassy and left to stake it out. Picking a balcony across the street as his best position he proceeded to unsuccessfully break into the apartment, calling forth a guard to the scene. After several attempts at lying to the guard, he escaped that encounter by killing him and left via the apartments building stairs only to be met by three more. Narrowly escaping he made his way to the street where he was arrested by the authorities and taken to jail. Locked in a solitary cell in the cell block, he then attempted escape only to be disabled once more by the law enforcement.
It is now the next day. After a restful night (provided you weren't paranoid over the Imperial Envoy in the nearby city), you are woken by the sounds of china clattering in the sitting room. Opening the door you see a couple servants placing out dishes for breakfast on the table as well as steaming plates of food. A few flimsiplast newspapers are left on the breakfast table to you to read at your leisure. Raik and Lucien, are also served their breakfast in the same manner, someone having the foresight to send Lucien's meal to Raik's room. The servants also leave a fresh set of clothes for everyone, provided by the House's tailor.
**Newspaper highlights** (don't read unless you intend on using it in your post)<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

On the second page of the main section you see an article concerning a droid which had confiscated after breaking and entering into a private residence. The droid killed a security in its attempt to escape but was quickly caught as it attempted to flee from the building. It gives an address in the downtown region of the city (if J9 gave you the location of the Embassy its across the street). The droid is currently being reprogrammed to serve the family of the guard who was killed.
In other news there's talk about the Imperial presence and the column indicates there are mixed feelings to their presence and what it means for the people.

Galen exits his quarters, rubbing his eyes. Paranoia had gotten to him, and the Imperial defector had spent half the night on alert before finally being able to sleep. He looks at the servants as they bustle about the common room, preparing breakfast for the group. "Good morning," he says to anyone else in the room. He picks up the newspaper and begins reading it as he waits for the meal to be finished.

### **Vash** (2009-06-15 01:43:54)

Al'verde walked out of his room with just a pair of shorts on, showing many battle scars, as he scratched the back of his head and yawned **"Well it is morning, not sure if you could say it's a good one."** he said as he looked around and skimmed over the news paper **"Well looks like there's a droid out there that would get along with Ex."** he said not really caring at the moment. Al grabbed some food and headed back to his room. After a minute he came back out now with a tank top on, his boots and his rifle slung over his back **"If anyone needs me I'm going on my morning run."**

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-06-15 05:59:50)

Lucien rests completely relaxed throughout the night (albeit not in his own bed), he doesn't intend to get up early. However he isn't really asleep either as he hasn't forgotten his little promise to Raik about a shopping trip, and his other promise to his mother. He spends the extra time in bed dozing and weighing up the various options deciding on how to best spend the time he has available while keeping his promises.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-15 08:24:56)

Once people start arriving in the common room the servants quickly finish and leave.

"You know, I haven't heard from J9 since he told me something may be going on here last night," Galen says as the staff clears out. He reads the same newspaper article that Al'Verde had commented on again. "He told me he may investigate, but didn't tell me the address. Still, though," he comments as he sets the paper down, "that does seem way too bold, even for him." He pauses for a second realizing what he had said. He turns to the rest of the group. "Someone please tell me it isn't…"

Kyle awakes and stretches, then gets into some workout gear to go for a run throught the garden with escorts trying to keep pace.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-06-16 21:23:11)

Raik walks into the bedroom, she was a light sleeper, and always woke early regardless of the activities of the night before. She'd eaten her own breakfast, as well as reading the news report. Having no idea that the aforementioned droid was formerly a member of their group.
When she finally had enough, she filled a bucket with ice water, and walked to where Lucien lay on the bed then threw fully into his face. "Come on, We have a busy day."

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-06-17 05:18:10)

Lucien takes the water in the face snapping awake, and pushing himself off the bed and too his feet, eyes scanning the scene trying to work out what is going on. Once he realises that it was Raik that splashed him in the face he smiles and says, "There were other ways you could have woken me you know." and begins getting dressed the clothes the servants had provided not bothering to question how they knew where he was.
Once dressed he asks, "Any preference as to when we go shopping? Or shall we start with the Imperial Envoy?"

### **Alicia** (2009-06-17 19:21:01)

Kyle and Al'verde are easily paced by the guards who seem to make a habit of running laps around a section of the grounds designated for their use in training and for the run itself. They had directed you to this area, highly recommending it for your workout.
If you decide to head to the training area for the laps you see you are joined by many of the staff who work and apparently live on the estate. In the middle of the track you see signs of the training area where there are some guards practicing with practice swords.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-17 20:53:37)

While running Kyle watches the sword practice with interest. He eventually stops and walks over for a better look. He studies the style they use, and ask to join. Think he may actually learn something here these people are pretty good.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-17 20:58:47)

Kyle is welcomed enthusiastically by the guards practicing and they hand him one of the practice swords which is serving as a stand in to a vibrosword. You are paired off with a middle-aged man who regards Kyle expressionlessly.
"**We'll start with parry in prime and work from there.**" He holds his sword up steady in one hand, waiting for Kyle to start.

### **Avarna** (2009-06-17 21:12:32)

"Shopping, but make an appointment to meet with the Envoy over lunch." Raik replied forcefully, She was now wearing the long gloves from the dress she wore the night before, but was wearing them with a tight fitting black one piece bodysuit, that was sleeveless and backless. The idea with meeting over a meal would make for a more casual meeting.
"What do we know about the Envoy on a personal level?" She asks, The fire haired near-human was clearly all business at the moment. Clearly taking a mental note of what she needed. She wouldn't need Clothing if Lucien's mother didn't mind her raiding that closet. Then part of her wondered why the house just happens to have a walk in closet filled with clothing that fit her.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-06-18 05:01:14)

"Sounds like a wonderful plan I'll have the servants arrange the appointment, while we have a nice relaxing shopping trip. As for what we know about the envoy personally not a whole lot yet, but I'm sure Anita has gathered some gossip about him from the other servants. In fact why don't we have her brief us on what is known about him before we start our shopping trip."
Lucien pokes his head outside to locate a servant have have them fetch Anita, so they can have a bit of a chat with her about the Envoy. Once he has done so he smiles at Raik and says, "So any idea what we are shopping for in specific? Or are we just going to go for a walk looking for anything interesting?"

Kyle steps back getting used to the weight takes a few practice swings, then steps back on the practice area and greets his sparing parnter. Kyle quickly takes the offensive and thrust his sword forward with one hand. Still trying to guage his opponents lvl of skill.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-18 10:30:00)

As Kyle thrusts forward his partner easily blocks the attack, "You're letting your arm drop." He resets his position waiting for Kyle to do it again.
Lucien is able to flag down a passing servant who will inform Anita he wished to see her. Sometime later there is a knock on Raik's door. (( Feel free to have the knock when you wish. ))

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-06-18 11:41:54)

"Yes, I need a Geological Compressor, as well as some other mineral samples. Unless we're fortunate enough to find a lightsaber crystal." Raik replied, That was the major thing she wanted, to get what she needed to complete the lightsaber she already had under construction.
"Oh, And I'd enjoy arranging a memory wipe for that foul droid that was harassing me aboard the *Resurgence*." Raik said as an after thought. She then walked over to Lucien, and on tip toes kissed and sucked on his neck, leaving a red mark behind. Apparently the girl felt a need to maker her territory.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-06-18 12:19:04)

Al'verde looked at the training area and shrugged as he continued on his run. As he ran he began to mutter a Mando Cadence, thinking back to his years in training. He continued his run for another hour before coming back to the main sitting room. As he walked in he looked around and sighed seeing that Galen was the only one up. He walked into his room and took a quick shower and walked back out in full armor, carrying his helmet, and looked at Galen **"I'm going to see if Lucien is around so we can get off this planet and back to our mission"** he says sounding rather annoyed as he walked out.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-18 12:36:05)

Kyle response ok, then swings again this time feinting to the right.

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-06-18 12:42:22)

"Good idea," Galen says as he finishes another cup of caf. "I'm going to stay in here. I *really* didn't like the way that Imp envoy looked at me. Besides, who knows what could happen in here if we're all gone."

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-18 12:50:14)

The guard sees the feint coming and pulling back knocks his sword against Kyle's throwing Kyle off balance. "Again?"
As Al walks out of the room he is passed by servants going to a fro as they go about their duties.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-18 12:53:24)

Kyle this time use an over head attack, impressed with his new partners skill with a blade.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-06-18 13:08:33)

Al'verde looked around before putting his helmet on with a small hiss of air. As he took a deep breath in he closed his eyes and smiled. He opened his eyes as grabbed the first servant he could reach on the shoulder **"Excuse me but could you tell me where I might find Lucien."**

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-18 13:42:44)

The servant Al'verde looked up at him stunned for a moment at the Mandalorian armor and then pointed to the next door a little bit farther down from where the door to the suite of rooms was. "Master Lucien was last seen in there, Sir. Is there anything else I can do for you?"

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-06-18 13:56:49)

Al'verde shakes his head **"Not unless you can get me the cargo I need."** Al'verde walked off before waiting for a response as he made his way to the door that was pointed out. As he walked up to the door he balled up his fist and and pounded on the door three times hold back the urge to break the door down.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-06-18 14:22:27)

Kyle this time use an over head attack, impressed with his new partners skill with a blade.
Dann quickly bring his blade up blocking the attack and smiles "Not too bad." Suddenly he drops kicking his leg out and quickly sweeping it across the ground
Kyle surprised by the block but not the leg sweep, jumps up while still engaging his opponent. As soon as he lands he throws this shoulder into the old man trying to make him stagger back.
Dann meet Kyles shoulder with his own and rolls putting some distance between the two "Your attacks are to gentle" he says before he quickly side steps, closing the distance, and brings his blade in, from the right, for a quick attack
Kyle parries the attack, and sends a palm strike to the old mans jaw.
Dann grabs Kyles arm as soon as the hit connects and snaps his hips quickly, bringing his foot across Kyles face right as he lets go of his arm
Kyle flips back with the momentum of the kick, then makes ready to counter then next attack.
Dann slowly sets his foot back down as he takes a fighting stance and takes a deep breath. Before he exhales he moves in with a quick thrust
Kyle sidesteps and swings his blade around in a high arc towards the back of his opponents' shoulder
Dann quickly snaps his hand back blocking the blow, but the force of the blow knocks him off balance cause him to tumble before quickly getting to his feet
"Your good" Kyle closes the distance and launches a flurry of 3 attacks
Dann smiles as he block two of the attacks and jumps back, using the momentum from the last attack that connected. As he jumped into the air he twisted his body around bring his foot at Kyles head at the same time bringing his blade down.
Kyle see a foot coming a barely blocks the attack with his for arm, this sends him staggering back and almost knocks him over. Shaking his arm, he switches his blade to the right hand.
Dann lands and quickly jumps back into his fighting stance "I'm very impressed. You have a lot of skill. I don't see that much in kids your age."
"Thanks, I sure that if your students survived your teaching, they would be just as skilled," Kyle responds jokingly.
Kyle still in the defensive stance, not sure if the session is over, but glad for the oppurtunity.
Dann lets out a little laugh "So are you up for a little more?" he asks. Before getting an answer Dann jumps froward swinging he blade at Kyles chest
Kyle leaps forward so only Dann's arm connects to his side and tries to use a headbutt. While using his foot to trip Dann.
"Well if your feeling a little tired old timer, we can quite?"
Dann throws his arm back, catching himself and rolls back onto his feet "Not at all, but I do need to get back to training the others. I truly enjoyed that spar. You are more than welcome to come back anytime."
Kyle bows, "I would welcome that, I actually learned something, your students have a great teacher."
Dann bows "Well it's good to know that other people think that."
"I'll be back in tomorrow same time, same place." Kyle responds

Lucien puts one of his arms around Raik as she kisses him on the neck, not minding the sucking in the least and says, with a smile, "Why don't we see what we can do about the shopping." momentarily forgetting they were supposed to be waiting for Anita, at least until there is a knock on the door, and his eyes move over to the door and he says, "Ah that must be Anita now." heading over to open the door and let her in.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-19 10:16:49)

There wasn't just one knock there were three insistent knocks. When Lucien opens the door, Al'verde complete in his Mandalorian armor stands on the other side.
Al'verde peering in can see Raik just past Lucien in a similar sitting room to the given for the others' use.

Kyle returns to his room cleans up and then heads out to grab a bite to eat. He also looks for the others, think this is nice and all but we need to get on with the mission.

Kyle doesn't have to look far for food as the servants had brought breakfast up to the suite.
When you leave the suite you see servants moving with purpose as they go about their daily tasks.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-06-19 13:09:23)

Raik runs up behind Lucien, tackling him down to the floor, just as the door opens to reveal Al. "Hello." She replies cheerfully, sitting on top of Lucien.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-06-19 17:43:30)

Al'verde let out a low growl, gritting his teeth **"Raik you need to make yourself disappear and quick. I need to have a word with Lucien."** he said slowly relaxing his fist *That's it if things do happen today I'll leave on my own and stay up in orbit till they're done playing with each other* he thought as he stepped froward "**Raik I'm going to *ask* you to leave one last time."** he said looking down at the two

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-06-19 21:22:35)

Lucien looks up at Al'verde from the floor and says, "I wasn't expecting to see you this early, but it's good to see you I could use your help with something. I would appreciate if you'd keep your tone civil when your talking to Raik though." he pauses and turns his head to face Raik as well as he can given she is on his back and asks, "Would you mind seeing what is keeping Anita, and what she knows about the Envoy, I'll be right behind you."

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-06-19 21:38:24)

Raik's friendly attitude faded immediately, and she glared at Al. "This is my room, so you can..." but her retort is cut short by Lucien wanting her to go check on Anita. Pausing a moment, she seems about to say something to Lucien, but instead digs her high heels into the man's sides before going though the door, to find the maid.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-06-19 21:52:52)

Al'verde balled up his fist again *What did he just say?!?!* **"I…am not…your…bell boy."** he growled in a quite voice glaring at Raik as she walked past. His head quickly snapped back to Lucien "**Look when your ready to stop playing around and fraking Raik we have a mission to complete!!."** Al'verde slowly pulled up his fist but didn't do anything "**You know what, when you have the cargo ready you can contact me."** he said turning and walking away **"and no I'm not telling you where I'm going!!!"** he added yelling. As Al'verde walked he made no effort to avoid anyone he bumped into.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-06-19 21:56:29)

Lucien pushes himself to his feet as Al walks out, and then heads out of the room to locate Raik and Anita, stopping only briefly to chat to a couple of servants on the way.

Talon woke up with a head ache.*"Agh. I must have drank alittle to much last night."* He cleans up and dresses.Grabbing his gun belt as he walked out the door of the suite he decides it would be good to go check on the Fortune and make sure everything is ready to go just incase. He finds his way back to the landing pad where he had left her and punches in the code to open her up and walks in. He heads to the cocpit, stowing his long coat and pulling out one the cigars he had brought with him. He runs throw some checks to make sure fuel was right and that everything was runnig normally.

[Alicia - GM] Anita is found in the Lucien's parents' meeting room she is joting down notes along with several other courtiers as his parents go over their daily tasks.
[Alicia - GM] The room is filled with the courtiers and advisors Lucien is hurrying down the hallway to catch up with Raik, but she will no doubt arrive in the room first.
Raik storms out of her room, without paying much attention to what Al had to say with Lucien. She was upset to be so causally dismissed like some common servant. With the Aid of the Force, she tracks down the servant, "Lucien want to talk with you." She says with a growl to her voice.
[Alicia - GM] Anita looks up from her pad at Raik and nods. With a short bow to the lord and lady she excuses herself leaving the meeting room quietly.
Lucien will arrive outside the room pretty much at this time given how short his conversation with Al had been, and looks between Raik and Anita when he arrives, but doesn't say anything immediately.
Raik turns and follows Anita out of the room. A black cloud still hovering over her.
[Alicia - GM] Anita looks between both of you and fixes her glance on Lucien. "You wished to see me?"
Lucien clears his throat and says, "Yes I did, Raik here pointed out that we didn't know anything about the Envoy and I figured you might be able to fill in some gaps about him."
[Raik] "And arrange for us to have dinner with him." Raik added.
[Alicia - GM] Anita nods. "I honestly don't know much myself, but I'd be happy to provide what I can. Was there anything specific you would like to know?"
Lucien smiles at Raik, "Ah yes I'd forgotten about that entirely, thanks for the reminder."
[Lucien] "Just an outline of who he is would be nice."
[Alicia - GM] "I'm afraid I don't know much about him personally. There's talk however he was sent by one of Emperor Palpatine's trusted loyalists if not by Palpating himself."
[Raik] "Do you at least have a name?" Raik asks, Part of her wondering how she ended up with the man that forgot an important part of their plan.
Lucien waits for Anita to respond to Raik's query.
[Alicia - GM] "Yes the envoy's name is Captain Jess Kendra."
Lucien looks at Raik, "I can't say I've heard of him, you know anything about him?"
Raik crosses her chest with her arms, as she thinks about the name, trying to recall if she'd heard it before, and if so where and why.
[Raik] "No, I havn't heard of him. He must not have worked with the Inquisitous."
[Lucien] "Well that has it's advantages and disadvantages. He is less likely to have heard about what happened with Draco, but he also might not know who you are."
Raik nods. Her eariler anger quickly fading away. "Yes, but it would have been easier to deal with him if he was already aware of my past authority." Raik pointed out.
[Lucien] "It's possible he still knows who you are by reputation if nothing else."
Raik shrugs. "Well, Lets get about our shopping then, and you will make arrangements right Anita? Either at the consulate or one of the upscale restaurants."
[Alicia - GM] Anita watches the exchange passively
[Lucien] "Try to arrange it for that place I went to last time I was here, what was the name again.. I think it was M-something, their dishes tend to be very nice and it's far more neutral ground then the consulate."
[Alicia - GM] "I will contact the embassy and see if the envoy is available."
[Lucien] "If you have to drop my name and title, it might free him up if nothing else works but
if you have to do that let me know it'll change things a little."
Raik grabs Lucien roughly by the arm, and starts to see him away. "Thank you." She replies to the
servant,
[Alicia - GM] Anita nods. "As you wish. Is there anything else you require of me?"
Lucien lets Raik drag him off saying to Anita as he is being pulled away, "No that's everything."
Raik Makes her way to the main gate, before letting go of Lucien, "Well. You know this place better
then I do."
Lucien knows exactly where the garage is but he also perfers the idea of a nice leisurely walk at least
part of the way and so he'll lead Raik out the main gate and start walking down the side of the road
toward the city, saying to her "It's going to be a bit of a hike, but it's a lovely day so it would be a
shame not to enjoy it."
Raik checks her chrono to see how much time they have, and if they'll have time to do the hour long
walk, as well as complete they're shopping before the lunch date with the Captian.
[Raik] "I think we'd better take a speeder." Raik replies. Tapping her chrono to make her
point,
Lucien looks at her watch, and smiles, "Ah always in a rush, very well speeders it is." and turns back
to head to the garage and collect a speeder to head into the city.
[Raik] "Besides, I don't think you want to carry everything back here anyway." Raik replied,
settling into the passenger's seat of the speeder.
Lucien gets into the drivers seat, "I never planned on it, I was going to have the servants collect it with
a speeder when we'd finished shopping."
Raik didn't say anything, but the look she gave Lucien made it clear that was going to have been
unacceptable.
[Alicia - GM] With the speeder you make good time to the city and soon Lucien has
maneuvered the streets to the market sector where he finds a convenient parking spot.
Lucien parks the Speeder, curious about Raik's attitude about the servants and thinking he might
know what the cause is of it but unwilling to broach the topic at the moment.
Raik literally jumped out of the speeder, taking a deep breath, and relishing the freedom she had at
the moment. Even if she had to have Lucien in tow. She still wasn't sure he wouldn't abandon her on
the next convient rock of a planet, now that she'd given into his desires. "I need to see a Geologist
Shop first."
Lucien gets out of the speeder, "Now that might take a little while to find, I've never actually needed
Geological supplies before. Still I'm sure we won't have too much trouble finding one."
[Raik] "Baring that, We can try our luck at a more mundane seller of jewels and crystals."
[Lucien] "Now Jewelers I know more then a few of, follow me."
Lucien starts to head off to the nearest of the Jewelers he knows about.
Raik nods, following Lucien without comment. She doubted they would have any crystals suitable for
a lightsaber, but she'd give them a try as it would save her time creating one.
[Alicia - GM] Entering the jewelers Raik is bombarded by the site of cases filled with solitary
jewels mixed in with similar stones polished and set into jewelry. Perception check
[Alicia - GM] ok, Ava you see several solitary cyrstals, some more rare than others which
could be used as crystals if cut properly. Bondar, Corusca Gem, Dragite, Opila, Rubat, Barab, Krayt
Dragon Pearl
[Alicia - GM] Lucien doesn't exactly know what Raik is looking for in particular having no real
experience with what sort of gems would be suitable for focusing a lightsaber
Lucien looks over the gems before turning to Raik to see if there are any in specific that she'd like.
Raik beams as she finds a selection of crystals, pointing out both the Barab Ingot, and the Krayt
Dragon Pearl. "Those Two, and Maybe that one." She ads also point out the Bondar.
[Alicia - GM] Raik and Lucien are approached by an elderly clerk. "Is there something I can
assist you with?"
[Raik] "We'd like the Barab Ingot, The Krayt Dragon Pearl, and the Bondar cyrstal."
[Alicia - GM] The clerk pulls out the lone solitary pieces and sets them on a velvet eye. "Ah
yes, the Barab Ingots are a rare find, coming from the planet Barab I, the ingots are difficult to find as
they are hidden amoungst the ore on the radiated surface." He sets the Ingot on the mat. "This Krayt
pearl was sold to us not to long ago by an explorer who made his way back from Tattoine."
Lucien looks at the clerk and says, "Interesting, and the prices?"
[Alicia - GM] "The Pearl has been priced at 120,000. The ingot at 80,000 and the bondar
crystal and meer 65,000"
[Raik] "Have them charged to the Estate of Valin Draco." Raik replied without hesitation.
[Alicia] "Erm, who?"
[Raik] "Valin Draco. He's a very wealthy man on Courasant, Or was. And owes me much."
Raik informs the clerk, keeping her eyes level.
[Alicia] "I'm afraid I can't charge an unregistered clients account without proper
authorization. You do of course have such credentials?"
Lucien is willing to let Raik continue her negotiation, feeling she wants to do this herself for some
reason, but unsure why.
[Raik] "I'll share an interesting fact with you. I'm doing you a favor. After all Lightsaber
components are illegal under Imperial Law, And I have it under good authroity that there is going to be
a meeting between Lord Lucien and the Imperial Envoy this afternoon."
[Raik] "Now I'm not sure what is going to be discussed, but a smart man would try to
liquidate anything that would simply be confinsated should the Empire take control."
[Alicia] THe clerk frowns, "Lightsaber components? These jewels are intended for purchase
to be set in custom pieces."
[Alicia] "And they are perfectly legal."
Lucien decides to take a look at some of the other crystals to hide his smile of amusement at Raik
mentioning his name and trying to strongarm the clerk.
[Raik] "But can you really take the chance that a member of the Inquisitous would see it the
same way?" She then takes out her lightaber, and activates it. "Or perhaps I'll just show you how
dangerous they can be first hand?"
[Alicia] The clerk doesn't seem impressed as Raik pulls out and activates the lightsaber, he
does however eye it warily. "I'll have to ask you to leave now."
Raik glares at the clerk, and prepares to jump over the counter...
Lucien decides to intervene having noticed the tone getting a lot worse, "I think that might be enough,
clearly the clerk knows how to negotiate."
[Raik] "Fine." Raik replies, deactivating her lightsaber, and snatching up the Barba Ingot.
Searching her feelings, to decide if any of these crystals are truely ment for her use.
[Alicia] 4:34 pm: Well you get a bad feeling about taking the crystal
Raik pouts as she puts down the Babar Ingot.
Lucien notices her expression and walks over to whisper to her, holding out a hand palm out toward
the clerk, "What's the matter?"
Raik doesn't repliy right away. "These crystals would have special effects when used in a lightsaber.
Unfortunately I can't afford any of them, And I think you wouldn't like it if I simply killed the clerk and
took them."
Raik searches her feelings, again, this time directing her focus on the Kryat Dragon Pearl.
Lucien smiles, "It definitely wouldn't be my first choice, are any of them worth the sums he is
charging?"
[Alicia] Like with the ingot you get the feeling just taking it would be a bad idea. The clerk is
meanwhile polishing the stones with a cloth and putting them back in the case, keeping a wary eye
on Raik
[Raik] "For the Babar Ingot and Krayt Dragon Pearl, Probably, But the Bondar makes a
non-lethal blade, and I feel its over priced."
[Lucien] "Okay so lets see what kind of deal can be made." and then turns to the clerk, "So
apparently you want 80,000 for this ingot, doesn't look like it would be worth 20,000 if I wanted to
make a necklace out of it."
[Alicia] The clerk looks at Lucien and then glances at Raik before turning his attention back
to Lucien. "Ah but it is sir, some like to see what the raw stone looks like before it is polished. A
specimen such as this can be turned into a fine piece." Reaching into the case he pulls out a
necklace with a polished version of the stone set in a handsome necklace.
Lucien glances at the necklace, and wave it off with an almost huffy, "Bah a mere bauble, perhaps
30,000 credits even after being completed, and since we are talking a raw stone here not something
already shaped it would clearly have a lesser value."
[Alicia] The clerk nods, "This necklace is prices at 250,000."
[Alicia] "See how bright yellow the stone is? How it seems to pulse?" He holds up the
unpolished stone that Raik had been examining. "THe brightness of the stone is what determines the
value and this one is exceptionally bright." He indicates the other polished stones.
[Lucien] "Brightness is definitely one measure but there are plenty of others, I wonder which
appraiser give it such an inflated value, was it Jolina? I hear her eyes have been going lately, only able
to see the big picture not the details."
[Alicia] "Jolina? Dear me, no."
Lucien smiles and waits for the actual name.
[Alicia] The clerk rattles off a name of some highly esteemed gemologist
Lucien nods, "Perhaps it might be worth a little more after all, I've heard of him and he is adequate
when it comes to pricing jewelery, perhaps 40,000 for the uncut gem might be a fairer sum."
[Alicia] "I'm afraid I can't go lower than 65,000"
[Lucien] "You drive a hard bargain, you must do this alot, 50,000 and that's my final offer."
Raik Finally takes a deep breath. "Leave it. We'll look somewhere else."
[Alicia] The clerk looks over at Raik, frowning. With the glance you both get the feeling he's
wondering why she is still there. "60,000."
Lucien smiles, "Lets split the difference 55,000"
[Alicia] The clerk moves to put the ingot back into the case. "Was there anything else you
would like to see, sir?"
Raik shakes her head, taking Lucien's arm, and starts to leave the store.
[Lucien] "No I think we've seen enough." and lets Raik lead him toward the door.
Lucien waits until they are outside, and the clerk having not called them back and says, "So 60,000
is the best I can manage, shall I purchase it? Or would you rather go shopping for other things?"
[Raik] "I can make a synthtic crystal with the proper raw materials and a geological
compressor." Raik tells Lucien once they're own the door.
Lucien curiously has made no mention of the fact that Raik has an active saber, or any mention of the
fact he noticed it was missing this morning when he got dressed.
[Alicia] As you leave the store you see a human male watch you as you leave, before he
turns and starts to walk away.
[Lucien] "Well I've ordered both of those, hopefully they'll arrive shortly." he watches the
person that had been watching them start to walk away curious, but not enough to follow quite yet.
[Lucien] "So where shall we go now." his eyes having returned to Raik, and keeping an eye
on the person walking away only with the corner of his eye.
Raik is alittle saddened by the fact that they were unable to get one of the crystals from the shop, but
she should have been better prepared for such a thing. Making her way over to a public terminal, she
put in an inquiry to what her status was within the Empire.
Lucien follows her over and says over her shoulder, "That's probably going to be a little out of date."
[Alicia] The holonet has been effectively shut down. Accessing such records is virtually
impossible from this location.
[Alicia] Lucien turns his attention toward the console and quickly lost sight of the man
Raik shakes her head. She'd probably have to use a terminal on Courasant to get any really useful
information. She checks her Chrono.
[Stark] Stark finds a spot to look at the cityscape while discretely observing the pair playing
with the terminal.
Stark is a young adult human with dark hair and eyes. He's wearing plain clothes, nothing fancier than
a pair of pants, shirt, and longsleeve jacket. He wears a belt and a second gunbelt from which hangs
a fairly unremarkable looking standard blaster.

While Kyle, Talon, and Galen attempt to figure out what happened to their droid companion J9 by heading to the police station, Raik and Lucien make a new "friend" outside the jewelry shop where they had been attempting to purchase some gems.
Now back at the estate, Kyle, Talon and Galen head for the practice yard to test their skills against each other. In the open yard surrounded by the track a few pairs of soldiers spar using their fists or with the practice swords with each other while others currently off duty observe cheering their respective parties on.
Stark having met Marian, Lucien's mother, heads off in search of Kyle in the practice yard.
Lucien was trying to contact Talon as he and Raik were about to leave the restaurant. Galen was going to answer the comm in Talon's stead.

Galen picks up the com after a few seconds of letting it ring, primarily to annoy the person on the other end. Finally, he answers it. "Ah, Lucien," he says. "Having fun, I presume? Anyway, we were trying to retrieve J9's memory core from the police department, where he's been dismantled. They're going to wipe his memory, after having a look at it, of course. We tried to get in and stop it so we could beat them to the job, for obvious reasons. We tried to get some of your political pull to let them allow us in, because we're CorSec officers, right? Then, you hung up on us…"

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-06-22 23:35:08)

Al'verde walked into the ship and proceeded to take off the top half of his armor "Hey Matsun get your sparing gear ready!" he yelled as he set the armor down in a neat pile. Matsun walked out of the cargo hold with a thick vest on and a pair of gloves. Al'verde pulled the Mesh Tape out of one of the many pockets that were on his armor and taped his hands up. Matsun looked at Al'verde "So were going all out this time eh. Someone really pissed you off eh vod." With out a word Al'verde stood up and walked out of the ship followed by Matsun. Al'verde then locked up the ship and headed off to the training grounds.
After the short jog the two Mandos arrived at the training grounds and looked around for an open spot. As Matsun pointed out an unused section of dirt Al'verde smiled. The two of them walked over and drew a large circle in the dirt "You know the rules Matsun. You step outside the circle the other gets a free shoot." Matsun responded by hitting his palm with his fist as he took a fighting stance. Al'verde took a much different stance, one that allowed him to use his strength more than his flexibility.
They both shouted something in Mando'a before Al'verde rushed froward. Al'verde threw the fist punch but Matsun spun avoiding the hit. Matsun continued to spin and brought his leg up to catch Al'verde in the side of the head, but Al'verde raised his hand up and caught Matsuns' leg just before he hit and landed a punch square in Matsuns' gut. Matsun buckled over for a second, holding his gut with one hand, before his looked up and quickly snapped his knuckles across Al'verde face. Al'verde stumbled back as blood started to run from his nose and mouth. He made no effort to wipe away the blood as he stood up.
Al'verde once again charged and skipped at the last second, bringing his boot up to connect with Matsuns' chin. Matsun flew back and hit the dirt sliding a few feet before stopping right in front of the line Al'verde had draw earlier. Matsun looked up and quickly jumped to his feet, rushing Al'verde before he could react. Matsun jumped into the air bringing his knee up to Al'verdes gut and then his other knee up to his face and finely dropped his elbow onto the back Al'verdes head. Al'verde stumbled form the assault as more blood dripped from his face.
Al'verde looked up and drove his fist into Matsuns' chest as the sound of creaking and finely cracking could be heard. Matsun stumbled back as he coughed up blood. He continued to stumble until he looked down and noticed that he had stepped out of the 'ring' and stood up not moving with his hands down at his side. Al'verde walked up and took a quick jab to Matsuns face before walking back. As soon as Al'verde turned his back to Matsun he stepped forward punching Al'verde in the back.
Al'verde felt the pain but didn't fall as he turned around just in time to catch one of Matsuns' punches. He looked at Matsun and smiled as he balled up his other fist. There was a pop, snap sound as their fist meet, knuckle to knuckle. Both men gritted their teeth and the pushed their fists together, nether one of them giving way as the sound of another pop almost echoed. Then Al'verde pulled back his other hand just as Matsun pulled his other hand back. Both threw one of their hardest punches, Al'verde aim for Matsuns face, Matsun aiming for Al'verdes chest.
As both fighters fell back nether one moved for a minute or so. At almost the same time both of them forced themselves to their feet and took fighting stances, bot of them feeling the effects of their wounds. Nether moved as the stared each other down. As they stood looking at each other they both let a small, bloody, smile creep across their faces.

Lucien says into the comm, "I was a little preoccupied at the time, I tried to call you guys back as soon as I had a free moment, but Talon's comm was turned off by that stage so I assumed it was unimportant. I'll see what I can arrange to get you the memory module, but it's not going to be very easy to manage."

## Stark Mausser

### **Xychotic** (2009-06-23 04:09:10)

Stark departed Marian Devereux's company in the garden shortly after learning of a man named Kyle. Having been told that Kyle could be found in the training area, he quietly walked over to see if he could identify the man of interest. He took his time observing the training field, but paid careful attention to the fight between the Mandalorians thinking, *I guess I should be grateful that Al'verde didn't take me up on my offer.* Once Al'verde's sparring match was resolved, Stark resumed watching the other people on the training grounds.
He was wearing an unremarkable pair of dark pants and light-colored shirt with a lightweight and longsleeve jacket reminiscent of a (real world) duster. He cinched the jacket closed with a utility belt and a gun belt, the way he wore it appeared remarkably similar to the kama worn by certain clonetroopers during the war. He's easily six feet tall but thin and wiry, with angular features giving him a stylized and statuesque appearance. He carries a pack tossed comfortably over his shoulder as he observes the people and their training regimens...

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-23 11:21:16)

The attention of the guards who had been watching their compatriots spar are turned toward Matsuun's and Al'verde's fight as it begins to grow in intensity. Moving to get a better view they begin to hoot and holler, at times hissing in empathetic pain.
All the noise would probably draw the attention of Kyle, Talon and Galen who was sparring on the other side of the training field.
---------------------------------------
Leaving the restaurant Raik and Lucien walked at a leisurely pace back to the speeder parked in the market district.

### **hayabusa** (2009-06-23 12:02:48)

"Oh thank the Force I never ran into Shysa's group…" Galen mutters as he watches the two Mandalorians box. Sparring was clearly no word for it, due to the brutality. He turns back to his conversation with Lucien, not seeing the newcomer to the training area at the moment.
"Thanks a lot," he adds, wondering when the next time Lucien's personal life would endanger his and the rest of his friends. "Do your best." he cuts the comlink at this moment.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-06-23 21:23:35)

Alicia: Kyle, you went to the training yard with Talon and Galen where you were sparring with Talon. THere you while sparring you hear a large comotion in the training yard to see Al'verde and Mat going at it. It's drawn the attention of the guards in the area and a stranger who is apparently not associated with the House (he's not wearing the house colors). Matsuun and Al are not wearing their Mandolorian armor and on after a double take you find there's something familiar about Matsuun. THough he has longer hair than you remember, he bears a striking resemblance to the clone troppers you worked with during the Clone Wars.
The stranger wears an unremarkable pair of dark pants and light-colored shirt with a lightweight and longsleeve jacket reminiscent of a (real world) duster. He cinched the jacket closed with a utility belt and a gun belt, the way he wore it appeared remarkably similar to the kama worn by certain clonetroopers during the war. He's easily six feet tall but thin and wiry, with angular features giving him a stylized and statuesque appearance. He carries a pack tossed comfortably over his shoulder as he observes the people and their training regimens.
Kyle: Kyle moves to get closer to the fight and get a better look at the possible clone trooper
Alicia: Matsuun and Al continue with their fight the guards around still cheering and howlering around them as they watching the brawl.
Kyle: Kyle surveys the area and notices someone doesn't belong, and tries to get closer to the stranger
** Stark is curious to see what Kyle was training in as he approached the mandalorians. **
Kyle: ((Kyle is wearing a training Gi))
Kyle: Kyle decides to take a direct approach and approach the stranger head on
Kyle: "Hello, who are you?"
** Stark takes a long look at the person approaching him. Assessing what he's wearing, carrying, and what he looks like. **
Kyle: ((Just an everyday sword))
Talon Rann: Hope this will stay.
Kyle: Kyle tries again this time introducing himself, "Hello, I am Kyle Qel-Droma who are you?"
Stark: ((What's an everyday sword? Longsword? Rapier? Katana? Sabre? Hand and a half sword?))
Kyle: ((Katana))
Kyle: ((Damn I wish I could just use his picture, Kyle is around 6' 2" 190lbs, Blond hair, green eyes, athletic build, has a bit of stuble for not shaving for 2 days.))
** Talon Rann stops and looks toward where Al and Mat are fighting."Man a, are they practicing or really goingat it?" **
Talon Rann: "Galen bring me my gun belt will ya."
Alicia: (( as hayabusa isn;t here.. ))
** Stark responds to Talon, or perhaps only mutters to himself in response to seeing Al'verde and Matsun fight, "Train hard, fight easy..." **
Alicia: Galen looks over toward the brawl, bringing Talon's gun belt. "Lucien got back in touch. He's going to try and pull some strings to get the memory core."
Talon Rann: "That is good."
Talon Rann: "Took him long enuff."
** Stark finally gets around to responding to Kyle. **
Stark: "Hello, Kyle. I am Stark Mausser. I recently made acquaintance with Lucien and Marian Devereux. She suggested that you would be someone that I would like to speak to."
Alicia: (( if you don't remember Marian is Lucien's mother ))
Kyle: "Did she say why," Kyle still curious tries to guage a potenial oppontent.
Stark: "No, and she struck me as the sort of person that wouldn't answer had I asked. The best I'd get is, You should find out for yourself."
Kyle: "You look famailar, have we met before somewhere?"
** Stark looks at Kyle a little more closely. **
Stark: "You look familiar to me as well... Were you in the war?"
Kyle: "Yes, yes I was."
Kyle: "What about you, were did you serve?"
Stark: "I was involved in a lot of recon and stealth missions so I went all over the galaxy."
Alicia: Al and Matsuun both collapse to the ground. Apparently spent for the moment.
** Stark looks at Kyle intently for a few moments before shaking his head with mildly sad expression. **
Kyle: "I worked with some of the Special Forces units and Clone and Republic Intelligence."
Stark: *sighs* "Maybe this will clear everything up." *reaches into his sleeve and draws the device any Jedi would recognize on sight and shows it to Kyle*
Alicia: (( i'm guessing its a lightsaber? ))
Kyle: ((Color))
Stark: ((Yes, and it's not activated.))
** Stark slips his saber back into his sleeve, careful to keep the saber hidden from view from everyone else. **
Kyle: "It does, but you never said wich side you were on (or did I miss that))." Kyle looks a little hopeful.
** Stark crosses his arms. **
Stark: "Would I really be this candid if I were an enemy? No, I'm a brother. I know now why Marian suggested you."
Kyle: "I wounder how she knew though, I never told what I was? I hope Lucien wouldn't spak about this."
Stark: "It's clear she's very perceptive. She also suggested that I show you something else, that a... that I came across. I can feel it's value, but neither of us could figure out what it was."
Kyle: "I could try."
Stark: "I'm going back to the garden. Bring who you trust, I'll show you there."
** Stark bows slightly and then heads back for the gardens. **
Kyle: Kyle single to Talon and follows Stark to the garden.
Alicia: Al and Matsuun jump back to their feet to a fighting stance, apparently ready to resume their fight
Alicia: Talon heads over and both of you follow after Stark who leads the way to a fountain where you see Marain, Lucien's mother who you had been introduced to the night before at dinner.
"Ah, I'm glad to see you found him." She says when Start draws closer.
Alicia: Marian smiles warmly at Kyle and Talon when they approach
Stark: "I can't thank you enough. To see even one more of our number alive is more than I allowed myself to hope for." *bows to Marian*
Alicia: She motions toward the tray of drinks beside the bench where she is sitting, indicating for them to help themselves.
Kyle: Kyle bow and thanks Marian, "How did you know?"
Alicia: Marian nods. "You're most welcome." Her attention turns to Kyle. "It is hard to hide what you have been you're whole life. I see that which many would miss."
Kyle: "And what is it you want e to see?" Kyle wonders if Lucien also has his mothers gift.
** Stark sits down and puts the pack in front of him. He pulls out something wrapped in a towel and hands it to Kyle, "Maybe you can decipher its meaning." **
Kyle: Kyle take the item and sits to study it.
Alicia: Uncovering the item you see it's a tablet. The tablet is circular made of a fine marble inlaid with silver filigree which is so perfectly placed it almost seems to part of the marble itself. The filigree set in some unrecognizable pattern in the center and encircled by text. The tablet appears to be rather old and worn smooth, the text only legible because of the silver filigree. The text is written in an unfamiliar language and try as you might you are unable to decipher it.
Kyle: "Where did you find it?"
Kyle: Kyle turns the object over and then trances the design, "Is it Sith in orgin?"
Alicia: Marian watches the exchange, demurely sipping on the lemonade.
Stark: "Does it feel dark to you?"
Kyle: "No not dark but there maybe another Master Denia may know."
Stark: "Master Denia?"
Kyle: "Yes, during our recent travells we rescued her, she is the one of two Master we have found."

"Perhaps we could get it imaged and send a copy to her to study." Kyle hands back the tablet, "Have you tried any of the historical societies?"

Stark accepts the tablet, carefully wrapping it in the cloth again and setting it safely within his pack. As he finishes sealing his pack up, he glances back to Kyle and replies, "Marian suggested that I speak to an archeologist, a teacher of Lucien's. I was thinking to consult a linguist, too, in the hopes of deciphering the characters around the edge."

Both men began to circle each other, looking like two beasts getting ready to pounce. Matsun was the first to spring, sliding up two quick jabs but the swelling over his eye caused him to miss. Al'verde wasn't doing any better as he threw another punch, nether Mando hitting his target. Al'verde how ever was able to recover and drove his elbow into Matsuns' chest. Matsun stumbled but managed to stay up on his feet. Al'verde resumed his fighting stance but it could be easily been seen that blood loss was kicking in. Al'verde took a deep breath and didn't see Matsun rushing him. Matsuns' shoulder hit Al'verde in the gut and caused him to fall back.
Matsun slowly stood up as he looked down at Al'verde, who was barely moving. Matsun walked away and took his fighting stance as he waited for Al'verde so stand. It took Al'verde more than a minute to get to his feet and take his fighting stance. As he did he tightly balled his fists up and looked at Matsun. Then he charged and grabbed a hold of Matsun, who brought his hands up just in time to grab Al'verde as well. The two of then butted heads together, but nether fell back, as both men continued to push.
The two Mandos continued to push their heads against the others, waiting for the other to give in to his pain. Finely Al'verde pulled his had back and smashed it into Matsuns. For a moment nothing happened, then Matsuns legs started to give as his eyes slowly closed and his body went limp. Al'verde, who was still bleeding, knelt down and picked Matsun up, throwing him over his shoulder as he slowly mad his was towards the entrance of the training area. As he walked he looked at one of the guards and took a deep breath **"Where's you sick bay?"** he asked barely able to hold his body up with Matsun over his shoulder.

Lucien and Raik head back to the estate and as the evening passes the tailor once more shows up with his assistants to help the men prepare for another dinner with Lord and Lady Devereux. (if you choose to opt out of the dinner please say so.)
Richard is the only one of the family not in attendance, apparently he has gone back to his ship.
For Kyle and Stark - Their activities
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

When Lucien returned Kyle and Stark got the name of the professor of archeology Marian had mentioned. As this second day (for Kyle) is growing late, you called to make an appointment with him for the next day. That night you both enjoyed the Devereux's hospitality for dinner where everyone was invited to once more share their dinner with the family. The next day you both set out early to head to the Aleria University where you are introduced to a brusque older man. His eyes light up upon seeing the artifact and he immediately gets to work on deciphering the letters. Pulling out an old text and a piece flimsi he begins to flip through the book. Hours later you are awarded for your patience as he hold up the marked up flimsi and he says, "Interesting most interesting. The translation was not so difficult, it was written in an archaic form of Galactic. Not many would recognize" He says proudly. Taking one last look at the flimsi he adds, "It appears you boys have a treasure map." Reluctantly he hands both the flimsiplast and the stone back to Stark. "I would keep your mouth shut about this if I were you. Wouldn't want the Empire to catch wind of this."
With those words he ushers you out of his office despite any protestations and locks the door.
Looking over the flimsi the professor gave you have to almost decipher his own scrawl. Admist scratched out words you are finally able to read:
Defiled by the Darkness and the Light.
The valley destined to remain forgotten.
Memorialized forever by their brothers.
The souls within shackled to the land.
Find a hive of life amidst decay,
And look for a horizon of endless stars,
Whereon few thoughts combine to affect great change,
Yet most have no power at all.
Seek the crown of the Queen's mount.
Where scholars reigned and knowledge grew.
The rock they built guarding their coveted wealth.
Now look up, seeker, and remember.

If there was anything else for Day 2 on Narash you wished to accomplish please say so.

Galen sticks around the palace, still somewhat steaming at he perceives to be Lucien's lack of care for their situation. He is, however, noticeably less on edge than he was upon first seeing the Imperial envoy and perhaps being recognized; the result of 48 hours of no attacks upon him. He still stays in the confines of the estate, however, still not trusting enough to venture of its "safety" unarmed.
There is one thing he hasn't done specifically: he hasn't told Al'Verde about his paternity. "If that's what he does to his best friend," Talon, Kyle and perhaps Stark heard him say after the brutal sparring match ended with one and perhaps both of the Mandalorians being hospitalized, "I don't want to see what someone he's angry at looks like…"

## Episode 33

### **Alicia** (2009-06-28 11:58:14)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">[Transcript](http://dod.swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50:session-33&amp;catid=9:dod-5&amp;Itemid=38 "http://dod.swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50:session-33&amp;catid=9:dod-5&amp;Itemid=38")</span>
Just as reminders here's the descriptions of Nizon.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The city is a major metropolis, but itâ€™s also the only big city you find anywhere. You can see starship traffic, proving that the city has a spaceportâ€”most likely, the only one on the planet. The city is built on a flat, rocky region between a large mountain and rough badlands of valleys and hills. There is construction on the mountain overlooking the city, but from here itâ€™s impossible to tell exactly whatâ€™s being built.
Starship traffic is regular enough to suggest the presence of more than just Imperial forces and the local population. A few small freighters, manufactured by numerous different companies, are landing or taking off. Given that they lack any sign of Imperial markings or identification broadcasts, they are probably privately owned, meaning that at least a few members of other species will be found in the city, making it easier for you to move around there.
Though they are nowhere near you, you pick up transceiver broadcasts from patrols on the far side of the city.
The city is sprawling, with 10- to 15-story buildings crowded around wide streets and public fountains. Most of the city looks old, constructed of stone and natural caverns. Ancient statues of rock and ornate decorative carvings are worked into most buildings, and even the roads are paved with carved stones. More modern constructions can also be seen, mostly watch-posts bolted onto buildings or gates that block access to some streets. Posters, wanted signs, and recruitment fliers for the Empire have been plastered everywhere, ugly debris atop the cityâ€™s natural charm.
Most of the creatures you see are obviously locals, the Nazren. The Nazren are tall humanoids about the same height as a Wookiee, but broader in the shoulder and narrower at the hip, with long arms and torsos but shorter legs. None seem to carry weapons, not even something as crude as a knife or club. Their noseless, flat heads are generally downcast and their shoulders slumped, but whenever one glances at an Imperial poster or flyer, it looks up, and a flash of hatred shows briefly in its eyes.
Though much less common, aliens from dozens of worlds also walk through the streets. Most are followed by one or two Nazren carrying heavy bundles of goods. The aliens go by without comment and are diverse enough that you see no reason your own appearance should draw unwanted attention.
The Imperial presence here is also obvious. Stormtroopers in small groups patrol openly through the city, and in the distance you can hear the mechanical stomp of military walkers, though nothing as big as an AT-AT would fit in the streets.

</details>

Kyle, Talon and Galen were supervising the unloading of the cargo. Apparently Lucien had been able to sell everything but the the 20 tons of water. Lucien, Stark and Raik had made their way back to the ship where they discussed the intel Stark had brought back concerning the detention camp and the holoimages he recorded. Al'verde continues to scout around the detainment center but after awhile will head back to the ship (he will arrive soon after Raik and Stark leave after their conversation, finding Lucien alone in the Firespray).
For the detainment center:<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

There are several small yards near the center of town, but these are clearly only for the elderly and very young. They have few guards and low walls, and the Nazren within them seem unlikely to be able to run even if unguarded.
The central detainment yard is different. Thirty meters on a side, it is a large square enclosed by a tall stone wall, which looks like it was built from the rubble of collapsed buildings. A metal gate in the north wall of the yard controls access and is apparently remotely operated. There are four guard towers, one at each corner of the yard, with two heavily armed stormtroopers in each. Two vicious, cybernetically enhanced Nek dogs patrol the inside of the yard, growling at the prisoners without getting too close to them. Most of the Nazren huddle together in the center of the yard, but you notice one captive keeping an eye on the others and moving around the outside of the group to stay between them and the Nek dogs.
Prowling along the inside of the yard are two large quadrupeds, roughly 2 meters tall at the shoulder. The vaguely canine creatures are powerfully muscled and covered in a tough brownish hide. Their huge mouths have three rows of razor-sharp teeth, and their legs each have three long claws.

</details>

The rest of the images include a testimonial from two locals. One about how the Trandoshans have been taking Nazrens as slaves (in spoilers below) and the last confirming the identity of one of the Nazrens being held in the camp is indeed Sartok.<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Stark: Okay, now I will ask him about who Sartok is and promise him that I have no intention to actually hurt him so long as I get the answer.
Nazren: The looks rather suprised and then says slowly still obviously frightened. "Sartok? Sartok is leader. He has been taken."
Stark: "Have your people been enslaved?"
Nazren: "Enslaved? Yes.. Slaves yes. Trandos take."
Stark: "Empire take also?"
Stark: I'm keeping an eye out for any patrols and will motion him deeper into the alley.
Nazren: "Take city yes."
Stark: "What do you mean? Do the imperials allow the Trandos to take slaves? Do the imperials take slaves?"
Nazren: The jumps at the sound of the a passing AT-ST and tries to bolt
Stark: I've taken him behind a building by this point.
Stark: The street shouldn't even be visible.
Nazren: you can hear them though
Stark: Then I will hold him there if I must.
Stark: Also, how did an AT-ST patrol past and make him jump and bolt before I knew it was there?
Nazren: you would have heard it as well its just the closeness of it making him jumpy
Stark: Then I will proactively reassure him that he's safe with me.
Nazren: "Sartok... speak to Sartok, yes."
Stark: "Where is Sartok?"
Nazren: "Captured. In the camp."
Stark: "Where's the camp?"
Nazren: "Center of ahdjok."
Stark: "Where is ahdjok?"
Nazren: The Nazren motions to the surroundings. "Ahdjok."
Stark: "I see. Thank you very much. What can I give you that won't get you in trouble?"
Nazren: "Just get Sartok."

</details>

It is now early evening. Galen, Talon and Kyle have finished getting the cargo unloaded and sent to their respective buyers. Raik has gone to meditate in her quarters. Stark has left as well for the *Fortune's Fool* and sees Al'verde as he returns and heads for his ship, the *Shadow Spire* (the Firespreay).

Al'verde looked up as he saw Stark **"I noticed you were scouting out the camp earlier. You find anyway in?"** he asked as he walked closer **"I'm planing on getting in there later to see if I can get the prisoners worked up enough to consider helping us build up our resistance. I'm sure I can find a few that will help us. Once we get a group helping us out it shouldn't take long to kick the Empire off this planet."**

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-29 10:32:31)

Kyle now just finished from the off loading of cargo, goes to look for a library for computer access to try and find out if anything about the stone and its message.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

[Alicia] 10:40 am: The city doesn;t have much in the way of a library. What the library does have is mostly current
information and is mostly propoganda provided by the Empire. And as the Empire has restricted the HoloNet to military
use, there's no way to get access to the information in other databanks from here
[Alicia] 10:43 am: would you like me to roll a knowledge check?
[thierryd] 10:43 am: Kyle ask the Librarian about books, from the time line of (( the ancient galactic language origin)) that
he may be able to look at?
[Alicia] 10:44 am: They wouldn't have anything of that sort as its a new branch.
[Alicia] 10:44 am: and Stark had the artifact "carbon dated" its about 950-980 years old
[thierryd] 10:44 am: Yes roll a knowledge check please
Alicia rolls 1d20: 10+6: 16
[Alicia] 10:45 am: fp?
[thierryd] 10:45 am: Yes
Alicia rolls 2d6: 4+1: 5
[thierryd] 10:45 am: 2d8 (Strong in the force))
[Alicia] 10:47 am: ok
reading through the riddle you realize that the clues seem to reference a memorial created on the planet Ruusan by the
Jedi almost a millenia ago. It was abandoned not long after it was made because of its isolated location. The place named
the Valley of the Jedi was also called Valley of Souls
[thierryd] 10:50 am: Kyle asks the librarian if he has anything available about Ruusan?
Alicia rolls 1d100: 47: 47
[Alicia] 10:50 am: nope
Alicia rolls 1d20: 11: 11
[Alicia] 10:51 am: nothing
[Alicia] 10:51 am: Ah wait.. actually
[thierryd] 10:52 am: Kyle almost leaves until the libriarian speaks, "Yes>"
[Alicia] 10:53 am: She'll have a volume of wars the Republic had been engaged in. The one she turns to was dubbed "the
New Sith Wars".
[thierryd] 10:53 am: "Is there a refernce to Russan?"
[Alicia] 10:54 am: During the war, there were seven battles on the planet Ruusan as the Brotherhood of Darkness led by
Lord Kaan and the Army of Light led by Jedi Lord Hoth.
[Alicia] 10:54 am: as the fought for it.. sorry
[thierryd] 10:55 am: "Can I get a copy of the text, please?"
[Alicia] 10:55 am: Apparently Lord Kaan had established a base of control there and at the final battle of the war (the 7th
battle of Ruusan) had thought trap Hoth and his army there to use his ultimate weapon. What the weapon was is not
mentioned
[Alicia] 10:56 am: The librarian points to a copier wher eyou can pay to make copies of the pages
[Alicia] 10:56 am: 4 in all. 10 credits per flimsiplast page
[Alicia] 10:56 am: for the war atleast
[Alicia] 10:57 am: there's references to Ruusan through out since there were 7 engangements there
[thierryd] 10:57 am: Kyle pulls out his credit chip, to make copies to any refenece of Ruusan.
[Alicia] 10:58 am: So you make copies of the 4 pages concerning the New Sith War?
[thierryd] 10:59 am: Yes, and about the other 7 engagements.
[thierryd] 11:00 am: Kyle is somewhat excited about finding some clues to the riddle.
[Alicia] 11:00 am: mm.. actually the war was rather long (1,000 years long thereabouts) so lets make it 15 total. But
references to Ruusan are scatteres throughout 4 of the pages
[thierryd] 11:01 am: Kyle sits to read what he copied, while thinking about the ridddle to see if anything stands out.
[Alicia] 11:02 am: here's the wikia page for the war.. depending on what you copied. Did you get the full text or just the 4
pages?
[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/New_Sith_Wars](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/New_Sith_Wars "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/New_Sith_Wars")
[Alicia] 11:03 am: Oh as a Jedi you would know the result of the war started the Ruusan Reformation as the Jedi'
[thierryd] 11:04 am: Not sure of what he needs he copies the full text
[Alicia] 11:04 am: Jedi's influence within the Republic and their practices were change significatnly. The acts were called
the Ruusan Reformation
[Alicia] 11:04 am: [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ruusan_Reformation](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ruusan_Reformation "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ruusan_Reformation")
[Alicia] 11:05 am: this being the more significant part which you would know as a Jedi:
"The system of government did not seem to change too dramatically (as the Republic had been ruled by a Supreme
Chancellor and the Galactic Senate as early as 15,000 BBY) but the Jedi Order underwent a significant adjustment. In
symbolic measures, largely to convince the Republic that they would not become a conquering army, the Jedi abandoned
their battle armor, renounced all military ranks (such as "Jedi Lord"Â Â Â Â , dissolved their commander-in-chief,
disbanded their army, naval and starfighter forces, and placed themselves under the supervision of the Supreme
Chancellor and the Judicial Department, effectively dissolving the Military. In order to lessen the chance of a Sith
resurgence, the Order began training children from birth. In addition, the training of Padawans was centralized on
Coruscant, to remove the danger of unsupervised students delving into forbidden Sith knowledge. "
[Alicia] 11:07 am: wat you see on the wookiepedia for the Sith War is essentially what you would learn from the book.
Ignore what it says about the Thought Bomb. The weapon Kaan uses is of unknown origin
[thierryd] 11:08 am: Defiled by the Darkness and the Light.
The valley destined to remain forgotten.
Memorialized forever by their brothers.
The souls within shackled to the land.
Find a hive of life amidst decay,
And look for a horizon of endless stars,
Whereon few thoughts combine to affect great change,
Yet most have no power at all.
Seek the crown of the Queen's mount.
Where scholars reigned and knowledge grew.
The rock they built guarding their coveted wealth.
Now look up, seeker, and remember.
[Alicia] 11:09 am: the information you have mearly serves to expand on what you know about the first verse
[thierryd] 11:09 am: Kyle keeps reciting this in his head over and over trying to see if he can find another clue.
[Alicia] 11:10 am: as an OOC the 2nd and 3rd versus of the riddle point to places you see frequently in the movies. So
jsut think about it
[Alicia] 11:10 am: use Wookie to help and remember not to think literally
[Alicia] 11:11 am: with the last two versus if you figure ut out so does your character
[Alicia] 11:12 am: ok?
[thierryd] 11:12 am: ((Ok))
[Alicia] 11:12 am: feel free to tell me what your solutions are and I can tell you how warm/cold you are

</span>
Al'verde has found somewhere to bunker down while he awaits for things to either calm down or that someone will come get him. Talon, Galen and Kyle, led by Sartok, find themselves in a series of caverns deep within the mountain. The prisoners have been stabalized unto Lucien can make it to them to provide the needed treatment. Sartok, leaves the group heading deeper into the caverns coming back sometime later dressed in a fresh change of clothes and now armed with a vibroblade and a blaster pistol.
To the three men with him Sartok says, "I've received word. Two of your companions have meet up with the guide I sent. They are being led here through the tunnels."
**Transcript for Raik and Lucien:**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Lucien and Raik made it safely back to the Firespray after the daring rescue of Sartok and the other Nazren prisoners. The two of them decided to take a nap for an hour, waiting for things to calm down a little bit within the city.
Raik spent the hour laying beside Lucien, as she settled into a Healing Trance. She had a few minor burns and scraps from rescure attemp, and now the majority of them were healed.
Lucien slept rather uneasily, as he wasn't exactly happy with the delay but it was unavoidable, and he did like the feel of Raik lying beside him.
Raik would have liked to remain another hour, but could feel Lucien's unease, So at the end of the hour, she came out of her trance, Kissing him lightly.
Lucien smiles when he is kissed, and looks Raik in the eyes, "Time to go?"
"Only if you insist."
Lucien sits up, "It would be nice to stay longer, but those people need my help."
Raik sits up. Then pushes him back down on the bed, and sits on him. pressing her lips against his once more, Firmer this time.
Lucien lets Raik push him down and kisses her back until they have to stop for breath and then says, "We really should be going."
"There's no rush. Kyle is with them, and he can place them in a Healing Trance if they're willing."
Lucien smiles, and shakes his head, "I think I trust my surgical skills a lot more then just a trance."
"And you can't do them any good if are detained at the checkpoints." She says leaning closer once more, kissing his cheek then his neck. "And if you must play doctor, I could use an exam..."
Lucien seems to be extremely torn at the moment between what to do, and is just letting Raik kiss his neck as his mind wrestles with his options.
[... In appropriate content removed ... ]
Raik kisses Lucien again, before getting up and going to the Refresher for a shower. Feeling energized Her mind was deciding one what would be needed, what sort of story would best serve to get them past the checkpoints, and back into the City again.
Lucien gets up as well to get some fresh clothes and the medical equipment he is going to need to work on the Nazren.
Raik comes out, and dresses quickly, leaving her hair to air dry. "Rent a speeder truck. We'll load it with some of the water."
"I suppose that would give us something of a believeable story."
"We're delivering it to a small farm. They're well pump has failed, and they're buying the water to get buy until parts can be manufactured." She fleshes out the story alittle more for Lucien.
Lucien nods, "Seem plausible enough, I doubt we'll get a lot of questions though. I'll see about getting the truck, I'll be right back." and head off to get them a truck.
Lucien, you go to rent a speeder only to find out that speeder rentals is being restricted.
Raik goes back to her room, and collects the lightsabers. figuring there would be a decent place on the truck to hide them.
Lucien seems completely unconcerned that speeder rentals are being restricted, they might not by renting to most people but he is confident they'll rent to him, and heads inside anyway to acquire the speeder.
You see a rather annoyed clerk and a couple stormtroopers in the office.
Lucien heads up to the clerk and says, "Ah so someone is still here, I need a speeder truck to transport some of my goods."
Clerk: "I'm afraid all access to speeders has been suspended."
Lucien raises an eyebrow, and smiles, "Do you know who I am?"
Clerk: "NO and I don't likely care who you are. You'll have to take it up with the Imperial consulate."
Lucien waits for a moment and looks at the Stormtroopers saying, "We'll go and get him already, lets get this boring business over with while I'm still in a good mood."
The Stormtroopers glance in your direction but otherwise don't move.
Lucien waits for a few moments and says, "I don't have all day here."
They still don't move
Lucien sighs, "Hopefully you two like working here, because I guarantee you once I've finished talking to the Consulate you two will be working here for a long time."
They seem unconcerned
Lucien turns and strides out of the speeder rental place and heads back to the ship to inform Raik that this is going to be harder.
Raik is waiting at the ramp of the hsip when Lucien returns, She can tell by the look on his face that he didn't secure a speeder.
Lucien says, "Seems like they aren't renting out speeders at the moment, so either we pay the Consulate a visit and get special dispensation or we postpone our delivery operation."
"Or we use the ships, Or find a speeder to buy."
Lucien shakes his head, "I don't think buying a speeder is going to be an option at this point, I suspect this has to do with what happened earlier. And taking the ships would be a bad idea, it's a little too obvious."
"Well, There is one more option." Raik offers, Going back to her quarters, and putting on her most comfortable pair of boots.
Lucien follows her in, and grabs his medical equipment preparing for the long walk.
Raik Takes a duffle back, placing the Lightsabers in it, and wrapping them in clothing, and adding spare filters for they're breath masks.
Raik also adds medical supplies to her duffle, preparing to act the role of Lucien's nurse.
You make your way to the edge of town, there isn't much in the way of checkpoints, just a couple barricades with some stormtroopers obeserving the citizens as they go about their business. When you reach the edge, Raik spots the mother she helped they night before.
Raik smiles, taking Lucien by the hand and leading her over to the woman. "Hello again, How is your little one?"
Lucien lets Raik lead him over to the woman, a little curious as to how they know each other but not about to ask now.
The woman looks around cautiously. "Good, good... Talk when in the safe place. This way." Without another word she turns and heads down an alley way, away from the edge of the city.
Lucien looks at Raik intending to follow her lead since she seems to know this woman
Raik nods, Still holding Lucien's hand she follows the woman. "Remember the other night when I went for the walk?"
Lucien nods "I remember."
"Al and I saved her from some stormtroopers, and thats why I'd gotten shot at."
The Nazren woman leds you further into the alley, away from any prying eyes.
Lucien nods, "It was a good thing you did, although I do wish you hadn't be injured doing it."
Raik kisses Lucien lightly on the cheek before looking at the woman. Simply following her for now, without any more side comments.
Lucien follows as well also in silence
The woman stops over a grate, looking around once more she bends down and pulls it up. Without a sound it comes up revealing dark tunnels.
Raik heads down the tunnels without hesitation, digging the lightsabers out of her pack.

</details>

Lucien and Raik are now moving through dark tunnels, catacombs built underneath the city. There aren't many intersections, the tunnels seem to lead from room to room. The Nazren woman seems confident in where she is going, she walks holding a torch in front of her for light.

"What about the other(s)?" Galen asks as Sartok approaches him. He looks around the hidden fortress for a second. "And I hate to sound inhospitable, but where exactly are we?"

### **Alicia** (2009-07-07 19:15:45)

Sartok looks up for a moment thinking. "We haven't heard or seen your armored friend since we left the city. As for where we are..." He makes a broad gesture with his left hand at the series of caverns and tunnels around you. With the motion you notice he is missing the second and forth fingers from his hand. "We are deep inside Mount Antas. The caverns farther in were once the source of a great pilgrimage."

Al'verde gritted his teeth and he pulled the tape tightly around his armor, using the jump suit under it as a make shift bandage "There that should hold long enough to get back to the ship." As he set the tape down he looked around again to see if the troopers had left yet or to if enough had left that he could take out the others and make a run for it.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-07-09 14:49:44)

Al'verde sighed as he saw five troopers still rooming around **"Well I could take them out but I'm not sure if I could do it before they call for reinforcements."** he asked himself as he turned on his HUD. He got ready to stand up but as he did pain shot through his chest and shoulder. **"Guess I'll just stay put for now…but Lucien and Raik need to hurry up."**  he said as he flipped on his comm and adjusted the settings so he could whisper as he commed Lucien **"Lucien you there? Look I've got five, cannon fodder, troopers looking for me. So if you guys bring a transport we shouldn't have any issues."**

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-07-10 19:25:00)

Lucien answers his comm as he continues to walk through the tunnels, **~Shouldn't be a problem then, we'll come pick you up as soon as we get to the others. Keep yourself safe in the meantime.~** and then shuts down his comm link and says the their guide, **"Any chance we could pick up the pace a little? Al sounds like he could use a hand sooner rather then later."**

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-07-14 13:22:30)

The Nazren woman nodded to Lucien, "The path is straight... I go get your friend." She pointed toward the tunnels she was leading Lucien and Raik down.
Once the two of them are on their way she heads back the way she came, the light from her torch soon disappearing.
--------------------------------
About a half hour after speaking to Lucien the troopers have not yet completely dispersed from the area. Only two remain now, but they are beginning to search the alleyways. Al'verde doesn't notice when the Nazren woman from the night before comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-07-14 13:31:20)

Al'verde spun around with his cannon ready, but when he saw the woman he raised the cannon and sighed **"Nice to see a friendly face."** he said gritting his teeth a bit from the pain **"So is there another path out of here or did you bring a gun?"**

### **hayabusa** (2009-07-14 13:39:49)

Galen walks throughout the Nazren base, checking out the wounded despite his own extremely limited first aid training. Hopefully, he thinks, he knows enough to be able to get some semblance of triage started to make things easier once supplies are gained. If they are, he thinks grimly.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-07-14 13:54:54)

The woman smiles at Al and motions for him to follow her deeper into the alley and onto another street. She leads him to another dark alley away from the prying eyes of passer-byers. Moving aside a grate she says happily. "Down." Not waiting for Al to go first she drops down into the darkness, picks up the torch she left there and relights it.
Once Al is in the tunnel she makes sure the grate is secure above them and begins leading him deep into the tunnels.
A couple hours later and a half hour after that, Raik, Lucien, Al and the Nazren woman make it into the main room where the Nazrens with the help of Galen, Talon and Kyle have set up the triage.
The woman takes off toward another series of tunnels, disappearing from sight and leaving Al alone in the somberly lite cavern.
The wounded has been confined to one general area. Moving through the base Galen finds that an area for kitchen has been established and there's already a few Nazren's working preparing food. He also finds a cavern set aside as a barracks, here there are some children playing as they are watched by an adult Nazren woman.
(( Everyone except for Stark are now in the same place ))

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-07-14 14:04:36)

"Pretty well organized," Galen compliments the Nazren as he looks around their base while triaging the injured. "How long have you all been fighting the Empire?" he asks. As he finally makes his way back towards the main entrance, he is relieved to see everyone on the raid accounted for.
"Good to have you all back," he says. He points towards the kitchen. "I don't think it's quite done yet, but you might want to beg for some of the food that they're fixing. We're doing our best to treat the wounded, too, but we could use a lot of help."

### **Avarna** (2009-07-14 15:55:12)

Raik finds herself in the cavern and reunited with the others. Leaving Lucien to attend to the wounded, she sought out Talon. Finding him working Triage. "Talon, we need to speak." She said, taking his arm in her hand and leading him away.
Talon looks at Raik. "Well I am kind of busy tending to the wounded. If it is important sure."
14/07/2009 12:27 * Talon walks with Raik as he cleans of any blood still on his hands.
14/07/2009 12:31 â€¹Raikâ€º "Lucien is here now." She offers as assurence that Talon can be spared for the moment. "It won't take long."
14/07/2009 12:26 â€¹Talonâ€º "Sure. About time to some of them need more then I can give them at the moment."
14/07/2009 12:19 * Talon looks around. "What happen to the Sarg?"
14/07/2009 12:43 * Raik leads Talon away from the wounded, to where they could converse without being overheard. "Your not getting that lightsaber back."
14/07/2009 12:48 â€¹Raikâ€º "Sarg?"
14/07/2009 12:04 â€¹Talonâ€º "Al"
14/07/2009 12:04 â€¹Talonâ€º "And why not? Kind of going to need it if I am to continue learning fron Kyle on how to use it."
14/07/2009 12:39 * Alicia quit (timeout)
14/07/2009 12:03 â€¹Raikâ€º "Ah. He went a different directing then Lucien and I." She explained. "Last we heard he was digging in."
14/07/2009 12:41 â€¹Talonâ€º "Well if one can handle them selves he can."
14/07/2009 12:27 â€¹Talonâ€º 'So anyway about my saber."
14/07/2009 12:08 â€¹Raikâ€º "Perhaps Kyle didn't notice it, because he didn't handle the lightsaber himself. But its seept in the Dark Side." She replied taking a deep breath. Then taking out her cred chip. "I have 7000 credits, they're yours."
14/07/2009 12:24 * Al'verde quit (timeout)
14/07/2009 12:48 * Talon looks at her with a puzzeled look. "So what does that mean it has never effected me. I quess I am not seeing the problem."
14/07/2009 12:04 â€¹Raikâ€º "Maybe you havn't heard its call because your not force sensitive, Or maybe because you haven't used it outside of training."
14/07/2009 12:28 * Hayabusa joins Roleplaying Room 1
14/07/2009 12:13 â€¹Raikâ€º "I'm not concerned about you, Talon, So much as if it fell into the hands of someone that it coudl tempt down the dark path."
14/07/2009 12:17 â€¹Talonâ€º "That could be true. But I guess to me it is just a weapon a tool like blaster or Bow caster."
14/07/2009 12:02 â€¹Talonâ€º "Like Kyle or you."
14/07/2009 12:00 * Raik nods. "Like Kyle or myself." She admits. "Which is why I intend to destroy it once this mission is over."
14/07/2009 12:18 â€¹Talonâ€º "And I am glad I fall under the heading of people you don't worry about. I the list of people you care about is pretty short.'
14/07/2009 12:04 â€¹Talonâ€º "Ok so how will I continue to learn from Kyle? Those thing aren't easy to come by."
14/07/2009 12:31 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º Galen walks into the general area, but stops as he hears Raik and Talon in a conversation.
14/07/2009 12:44 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º ((Mind if I join in, all?))
14/07/2009 12:00 â€¹Talonâ€º ((Not at all.))
14/07/2009 12:08 * Raik sighs. "I can build them." I just need the parts."
14/07/2009 12:20 â€¹Raikâ€º ((Sure))
14/07/2009 12:05 â€¹Talonâ€º "Well then I guess you will just have to build me one then. Without the spooky darkside stuff."
14/07/2009 12:44 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Mass produced lightsabers," Galen says with a chuckle. "No offense," he quickly adds.
14/07/2009 12:59 â€¹Talonâ€º ((What is Raik's boyfriends name again?))
14/07/2009 12:15 * simplyscribed quit (timeout)
14/07/2009 12:17 * Raik nods. "Very well then." Raik then turns and looks at Galen.
14/07/2009 12:24 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º ((Lucien, isn't it?))
14/07/2009 12:26 â€¹Raikâ€º ((Raik has hooked up with Lucien))
14/07/2009 12:38 â€¹Talonâ€º "Also, I have noticed that Lucien has been a bit distracted as of late. You wouldn't know if he has anything on his mind other the the mission?"
14/07/2009 12:23 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "What?" he says as Raik stares at him.
14/07/2009 12:05 * Raik takes a deep breath, placing a hand over her midsection. She wanted to get angery at Galen for the interuption, but couldn't when Talon asked that question.
14/07/2009 12:25 â€¹Raikâ€º "I'm pregnate, with Lucien's Child."
14/07/2009 12:07 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º Galen is speechless at the revelation, the only thing he can do is just stare, mouth slightly open.
14/07/2009 12:17 * Talon looks at her in surprise. "Well I guess that would be a distraction then. Does he know?"
14/07/2009 12:31 â€¹Talonâ€º ((Boy that came out of left field.))
14/07/2009 12:24 â€¹Raikâ€º "Yes and its the reason we'll be wed when we return to his homeworld."
14/07/2009 12:29 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º ((I knew from reading a transcript of a previous RP, but this is the first time my character knows. By the way, I've always wanted to say this "Does anyone in the Star Wars galaxy use birth control?!";))
14/07/2009 12:01 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º ((Damn smiley face...))
14/07/2009 12:49 â€¹Talonâ€º "So after this you go about your lives while the rest of us just continue on fighting the good fight?"
14/07/2009 12:19 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Are you sure it's his?" Galen accidentally blurts out.
14/07/2009 12:24 â€¹Talonâ€º "You realize you will ave to hide the child because of what it might be?"
14/07/2009 12:59 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º Galen braces for some sort of attack, the comment he made was supposed to just be a thought. Though, with a dark Jedi it might have been "heard" anyway.
14/07/2009 12:32 * Raik turns and glares at Galen. "Yes." Then turns her attention to Talon. "That we have discusses, and Lucien's family will assist us."
14/07/2009 12:05 * Talon looks at Galen with a look of annioance.
14/07/2009 12:40 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "I'm sorry..." he says as both of them glare at him. 'I would have thought her and Draco...' he thinks.
14/07/2009 12:36 * Raik slaps Galen. "That is none of your business!"
14/07/2009 12:38 â€¹Talonâ€º "What about you and Lucien? You are just going to turn your backs on us and walk away from freeing the galaxy."
14/07/2009 12:25 â€¹Raikâ€º "My Place is with Lucien now. The decision is his."
14/07/2009 12:26 â€¹Talonâ€º "There is more at stake here then your happiness Raik if you havn't noticed."
14/07/2009 12:56 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º 'Damn Jedi and their mind reading...' Galen thinks, holding his smarting cheek. "Are sure even that would be safe for the kid, though?" Galen asks.
14/07/2009 12:41 â€¹Raikâ€º ((Galen, Unless you make it clear its a thought. I'm going to assume you say it))
14/07/2009 13:19 â€¹Talonâ€º (( it still works run with it.))
14/07/2009 13:24 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º ((I did. I put "he thinks" at the end. Worked out well that way, though.))
14/07/2009 13:44 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "The decision is his?" Galen says, trying to make up for his offensive thought. "It should be yours, too."
14/07/2009 13:41 â€¹Raikâ€º "The information we gather here, Proof that Nizon has been enslaved, will be enough to convince Lucien's family not to accept the Empire's offer. So whats going on here is even more important."
14/07/2009 13:52 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º 'Damn, and I thought it was Lucien under the possibility of mind control once," Galen Thinks as Raik answers Talon. He takes another step backward, wary of another slap from a mind-reading Jedi.
14/07/2009 13:56 * Raik takes a deep breath, trying to calm things. Part of her wished she'd brougth her new pet Tooke with to pet and help ease her mind. "I've made my choice, and my choice is Lucien."
14/07/2009 13:31 â€¹Talonâ€º "That is fine, but what if the Empire doesn't take no for an anwser and last time we where there seemed to be some people that wanted them there."
14/07/2009 13:49 â€¹Raikâ€º "That is beyond my ability to control, Talon."
â€¹Talonâ€º "But it will effect you and Lucien's family they stand to lose everything."
14/07/2009 13:44 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "You can look into your own options, though," Galen suggests. "Don't trust Lucien's family as the very best option because the Empire has given up on the planet at this time."
14/07/2009 13:12 â€¹Raikâ€º "Please. I'm finding the path of redeption difficult enough, without your pressing your doubts upon me."
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Look," Galen says to Raik. "I still don't completely trust you, but I can sympathize with your plight if it's legitimate as you claim. You need these doubts, or you may just end up right back in the same situation where you were originally. Or worse."
14/07/2009 13:12 â€¹Talonâ€º "Sorry Raik. I was looking out for the people that I care about. I guess we all have something to lose in this."
14/07/2009 13:53 â€¹Talonâ€º "Well I have work to do. Let me know when the saber is ready."
14/07/2009 13:13 * Raik glares at Galen. "You know nothing." Then she nods to Talon, before storming off.
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "I know nothing?!" Galen says as Raik storms off. "I know more of it than you think I do," he says, taking several steps in her direction.
14/07/2009 13:20 * Talon glears at Galen. "You eally need to work on your people skills."
14/07/2009 13:03 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "What can I say, it's been a tough day..."
14/07/2009 13:29 * Talon follows after Raik. "Look. I am just trying to get you to look at the bigger picture here."
â€¹Talonâ€º Taqlking to Raik. "I have put alot at risk here as well my family and bother could be imprisoned cause my action working who we are working for."
14/07/2009 13:30 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Do you know where I would be if I didn't have doubts?" Galen asks, following after Raik. "If I didn't make at least some choices on my own? I'd still be with the Empire, slaving under a stepfather who decided it'd be for the best to remain in the Navy and just accept the Empire."
* Raik pauses a step, And listens to Talon, she is about to say something to him, when Galen approaches once more.
14/07/2009 13:04 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Oh great," Galen says as he sees some Nazren no doubt look his way. 'I'm going to have some explaining to do to them," he thinks of the Nazren.
14/07/2009 13:43 â€¹Raikâ€º "YOUR doubts are YOUR concern. If I doubt, Then I turn my back on the harder road, and return to the Dark Side."
â€¹Raikâ€º "Carry your own burdens and grow stronger, instead of trying to pass them off to others."
14/07/2009 13:47 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Look," Galen says. "I'm sorry for making you angry. I've said--and thought--a lot of stuff I shouldn't have. Just think about it a little," he suggests. "I'm not trying to send you to the dark side, I'm trying to see to it that you don't end up doing something you may regret and have that send you down that path again."
* Raik takes both lightsabers in hand. "Say one more word in ignorence, and it shall be your last."
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º Galen backs away, hands help up and open in a gesture of submission. "Alright..." he says.
14/07/2009 13:51 * Talon steps in between Raik and Galen."Look you both need to calm down. There is no need in fighting going on between us."
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "I deserved that. It's your life, and listen to yourself, not me."
14/07/2009 13:02 â€¹Talonâ€º "Galen I think that is the most intellent thing you have said so far."
14/07/2009 13:22 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Great," he says, hands still up, waiting for Raik to put her lightsabers away. "Next time I do something way too foolish just remember that I come to my senses with a lightsaber held up to me..."
14/07/2009 13:32 â€¹Raikâ€º "I've had the Hag Denia preaching to me, as well as Stark." Raik tell them, calming down slightly. but still not putting away the lightsabers. "I don't need people judging me, or people telling me what they thing I need to hear."
â€¹Talonâ€º "Look, we all have something to loose. If you need any help call and I wel get there as fast as I can."
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Let's, uh, forget this conversation ever happened..." Galen suggests. "Do your own thing. Please, put the lightsabers away. I get your point..."
14/07/2009 13:17 â€¹Talonâ€º "I am not jugdeing you Raik."
14/07/2009 13:58 â€¹Talonâ€º "Trust me, I understand what it is liked to be jugde by others."
Talon walks away grabing Galen by the callor and drags him off.
14/07/2009 13:39 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "No need to say anything," Galen says as Talon pulls him away from Raik. "I kriffed up."
14/07/2009 13:40 * Raik finally returns the lightsabers to they're place concealed in her gloves. She turns her back as Talon pulls Galen away, then tries to find a spot to calm herself.
â€¹Talonâ€º Talking to Galen as he drags him off. "You really have a death wish you know."
14/07/2009 13:05 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "I thought I'd try to help her a little. I didn't expect she'd pull her lightsabers."
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º 'Unfortunately, the way I thought was best does nothing but tick her off."
14/07/2009 13:07 â€¹Talonâ€º "Well I guess she took afence to your helpfull words."
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "It didn't help that she caught my initial thought that the kid may have been Draco's..." he whispers as Raik walks away. "That's when she slapped me."
â€¹Talonâ€º "Ya, be gald it was a slap. I know ladys that would have put a blaster bolt in you for that."
14/07/2009 13:20 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "I didn't expect for her to pick it up. Bad mistake. I really should watch what I'm thinking around Jedi..."
14/07/2009 13:41 â€¹Talonâ€º "Yes you should."
14/07/2009 13:47 â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "It's just..." Galen says. "She's too busy thinking that she'd fall to the dark side if she thinks for herself that she seems to be entirely too trusting. I don't want a kid growing up an Inquisitor."
â€¹Talonâ€º "Just let the future tell us that.
â€¹Hayabusaâ€º "Yeah, I'm not the one who can actually sense that kind of stuff," he says.
â€¹Talonâ€º "Well I am more worried about getting my ship back and getting off this rock."

Lucien gets to work on the injured as soon as he arrives, starting with those most gravely injured and working until everyone has been treated, not even exhaustion would be enough to stop his work. His hands move as quickly as he dares trying to get everyone treated as soon as possible to make up for the time that he had missed, but unwilling to compromise the quality of their care because of this.
While he is treating the wounds he does his best to keep track of all of the cruelties the Empire has inflicted upon these people, so he can update his family on it later.

Al'verde, Galen, Talon and Kyle leave soon after Raik and Lucien and try to make it to the ships. The speeder is stopped at the first checkpoint into the city and Al is requested to come with the troopers. A fight ensues as Al refuses and after quickly dispatching the troopers they speed off before the two walkers reach their position.
Lucien and Raik after heading to the ships to collect gear leave to go place themselves for the riot. Lucien is stopped at a checkpoint because of his suspicious attire and Raik quickly decides to solve the matter by attacking the troopers at the guard post.
It doesn't take long for the sounds of a running walker to reach them. Raik heads off to face the walker with Lucien trailing behind.
It doesn't take long for Raik to find the walker, it's taken position at the next checkpoint. The troopers have closed the checkpoint and have taken cover behind the barricade as the walker also stands behind it. As soon as Raik is in range it takes a shot off at her and Lucien. Neither of them are extremely phased by the autofire shots (take 6 damage).
With Al piloting, the speeder takes off through the alley ways. After a near miss where he almost collides with a wall he returns it the street toward the spaceport. Only to run across a checkpoint where a RT walker has taken position. It's currently facing away, looking further down the street where it discharges its weapons. The troopers for this checkpoint are also facing in the same direction and have taken cover behind this side of the barricade.

Galen sighs as he sees the walker-manned checkpoint. "Didn't we just leave one of these behind?" he sighs, making sure to have a good grip on his borrowed assault blaster rifle. He sees it fire before taking a quick look at his surroundings. "Great, looks like some of Sartok's men have jumped the gun."

### **Darren** (2009-07-22 06:25:25)

Lucien sweeps his gaze quickly over the scene in front of them with the line of men and the walker behind the barricade with them standing together and really doesn't like the situation. He raises his Heavy Repeater anyway aiming at a bunch of the Storm Troopers behind the barricade while saying to Raik, **"We might want to take cover."**
He knows she isn't going to listen though and is going to go charging at the walker to take it out, and so he opens fire at the Storm Troopers he aimed his weapon against, not bothering to take the time to head for cover only hoping to take out some of them before they can fire at Raik, not really worrying about his own defence.

Al`verde smiled as he looked at the walker **â€œThat walker is mine.â€** he said as he checked his jet pack **â€œJust over 50 meters, that shold be enough. Ok someone needs to take the wheel.â€** he said standing up and taking aim on the walkers pilot as he preped his jet pack.

On foot **Talon, Galen and Kyle**... <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

make their way toward Martyr's Plaza and came across a group of Nazren who were having difficulty with convincing another party through a commlink. Galen took control of the situation, but when he called on an air strike he was met by suspicion. Over the din of the surrounding battles, a mass explosion can be heard from the northeast of their position. It's not the same as what you would expect from a V-wing's strafing run nor from an orbital bombardment from a Star Destroyer.

</details>

Taking the remaining speeder, **Al and Stark**... <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

make their way toward the building they can see is on fire.The sounds of distant combat echo from every street as the city erupts into widespread violence. The smell of smoke and burned insulation becomes thick enough to reach you even through your filter masks. A loud clap of thunder announces the opening of heavy blaster artillery bombarding the city from the base of Mount Antas. One of the heavy bolts arcs into the city near you, and a wave of debris showers over you as a building takes a direct hit.
Nazren children inside the building cry for help as the structure leans to the side, and fire bursts out through the lower-floor windows. A few adult Nazren rush toward the building but are forced to take cover as stormtroopers on the roof of a nearby warehouse open fire on them. While the children seem to be moving safely to the top of their ravaged home, the burning building will claim their lives in a matter of minutes if the stormtroopers donâ€™t allow some rescue effort.

</details>

**Raik and Lucien** .. <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

reach the top of the building. Lucien worn out by the trip up the flights of stairs carrying the heavy parts to some as of yet unknown device, doesn't notice that in the distance smoke is coming from a building to the east. Raik however does spot this and can also see that the area in that vicinity is being bombarded by something at the base of Mount Antas, though she can suspect its heavy blaster artillery.
Nearby, the Nazrens get to work on assembling the weapon, though really they are just laying the pieces out and trying to determine how it is put together. Once of them fumbles with the parts, nearly dropping it as he tries to determine how its put together.

### **hayabusa** (2009-07-26 13:23:46)

Galen looks northeast after the sound of the explosion finally dies down. "That wasn't… What was that?" He looks at the group with him and continues heading towards the plaza.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-07-27 05:41:48)

Lucien heads over to help the Nazren with putting the weapon together as he would rather it be functional once it is fully assembled and it looks like at least one of them doesn't really know what he is doing. Lucien looks over the components for a few moments when he arrives trying to put together a mental picture of the weapon and work out how the pieces will slide together.
Once he knows what he is planning to do with the parts, he walks over to the Nazren that seems to be having trouble and says **"Allow me to handle this."** holding out his hands for the parts and starts using them to attempt to construct the weapon.

**Results of Round 5**
Stark having parked the speeder, continues in the direction of the turrets still in a defensive position, his intentions are however unknown.
Lucien advances toward the southern most turret.
Kyle having taken out the first of the AT-STS heads around the dome intent on taking out the 2nd AT-ST.
Al'verde having taken over the northern turret, stuns the fleeing previous gunner with Talons help. With nothing in his line of sight (the remaining ST has cover behind a statue and the dome of the building obscuring his shots at the other turrets) he has nothing to fire at from this position.
Galen has been trying to gain access to the eastern turret with no success.

Galen attempts to open the turret doors again.
EDIT: Talon remains behind the cover he's behind, knowing that he doesn't have the firepower to realistically take on the AT-ST walker.

### **Darren** (2009-08-06 05:21:10)

Lucien continues to circle around to turret 3, intending on opening the door when he arrives, he is moving with a bit less caution now, and a bit more speed (not going full defensive this time).

Stark concentrates on Raik intending on pulling her out of the cage using Fold Space. Easily accomplishing this, Raik is pulled out before the cage can react to the use of the Force. Raik appears instantly beside Stark who offers her his saber.
The crab droids continue their assault, one attempting to attack Kyle who is clinging to the back of the climbing droid about 6m up in the air. Trapped, Kyle takes a critical hit (Crit - 32 damage: 60 /130 HP). The other droid takes a swipe at Talon with its claws but Talon dodges to the side.
Raik now free of the cage takes a moment to collect herself before concentrating on the thermal detonator. With a swift and decisive motion she sends the detonator to land in the path in which Vrakth is rolling.
The detonator goes off catching the rolling Vrakth and Lucien in its blast. Both of them manage to dodge out of the way of the worst of the blast (17 damage). More debris is scattered as the burning ship begins to collapse in on itself. Vrakth is still, but obviously breathing as he tries to collect his senses. No longer trapped and now some distance from Lucien he stands.
Lucien taking aim on the retreating Zabrak, opens fire on the Zabrak, but the autofire attack only partly catches Vrakth.
Galen before retreating into the ship fires a shot off at the droid Kyle is hanging onto, but only manages to hit the strut next to the droid.
Talon takes a shot at the droid attacking him, managing to hit it.
Kyle still clinging to the droid with one hand brings his saber around to slash at the droid. Cutting through a couple of its legs the droid with Kyle still on it crashes to the ground, calling on the Force, Kyle releases is grip on the droid and manages to land on the ground next. Standing from his crouch he prepares to go to Talon's aid.
Al'verde draws his rifle and takes aim on the droid attacking Talon. No match to his well aimed shot the droid powers down.
((Only Vrakth is still standing.))

Raik narrows her eyes, and takes hold of Stark's Lightsaber. Letting out a animalistic roar, she charges towards the Zabrak.

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-16 18:13:18)

Talon notches a bolt into his bowcaster and takes aim at Vrakth. "Stop right there," the CorSec agent orders, prepared to fire if any more hostile action is taken.
Galen heads towards the small med bay aboard the YT and tries to get his wounds to stop bleeding.

---

## Stark Mausser

### **Xychotic** (2009-08-16 23:52:52)

Stark intends to stay back and defend himself, watching Raik take action and considering possible action to be taken against Vrakth if necessary.

### **Darren** (2009-08-18 05:33:51)

Lucien will chase after Raik and the fleeing Zabrak, but doubts he could keep up with them even if he weren't in his powered armour. He will look for the opportunity to take another shot at the Zabrak but only if he can do so without hurting Raik.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-08-18 13:29:50)

Al'verde lowered his rifle and glanced around, making sure that there were no more targets, before turning and heading towards the ship with the Zabrak. As he walks in and sees Raik charging he, with the intent to kill **"Don't kill him!! I'm want some information out of him."**  he says as he flips his rifle to stun, pointing his gun in the direction of Raik and the Zabrak. He quickly put his finger on the trigger, ready to shot the Zabrak if he runs, or Raik if she connects.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-08-18 17:38:39)

As Raik charges the bedraggled Zabrak, Stark hangs back watching the scene. Al'verde entering the ship calls out in warning to her too late as she brings her saber around, her wrath evident. As Vrakth brings up his weapon to fire a shot off at her, she cuts of the hand holding the heavy blaster and in another quick movement also severs his head from his body.
((END OF COMBAT))
Rushing onto the burning ship Talon and Kyle following find Raik standing over the corpse of a red armored figure.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-08-18 17:56:34)

Raik, clearly still in a rage, continues to hack away at the body. Finally throwing Stark back his lightsaber and taking back both of her lightsabers. She then stripped the corpse of everything, glaring at the rest of the people as if daring them to stop her...

---

## Stark Mausser

### **Xychotic** (2009-08-18 18:05:39)

Stark catches his saber with quick motion and slips it back into his sleeve. He gives Raik a quick nod before stepping out of the ship, not even remotely interested in watching her continue her vengeance. Once outside, he surveys the scene, watching for anything that should capture his attention.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-18 19:25:05)

"Oh, not again…" Talon mutters as Raik mutilates the figure beyond any recognition. He raises his bowcast again, this time at Raik, intending to fire the very second she makes any kind of hostile action towards the others. "Drop the lightsabers," he orders, his voice firm. "Now."
He looks at the others in the damaged hold, asking them what exactly happened, his eyes still on the dark Jedi.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-08-18 23:54:19)

**"Haar'chak dala! Why did you have to kill him!?!?"** Al'verde yells fighting the urge to shoot Raik. As he pushed his rifle down hiw his other hand he began cursing in Mando'a. As he slowly calmed down he glared back at Raik **"I should confine you to your quarters for that"** he said quietly as he took a deep breath **"You are still a mirci't to darjetii ways."** As Talon raised his rifle Al'verde glances at him **"Lower your weapon, she's my responsibility"** he growled.
Al'verde looked over at Raik as he placed his rifle across his shoulders and walked over to her **"Go a head, do something."** he said gripping the handle of his rifle as his cannon lowered, but did not point it at Raik<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Damn it woman!/You are still a prisoner to your sith ways

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-08-19 02:07:27)

Lucien looks at Raik, probably the only one not fighting any urge to kill her. His eyes are almost thoughtful as he slings his heavy repeater over his shoulder and steps toward casually her saying, **"Honey you are clearly upset right now, lets not do anything you will regret later."** he is making no move to be ready if she decides to attack him with her sabers as if the thought that she might do that had never entered his thoughts.
Once he is alongside her, he will put one of his hands on her shoulder, but he won't be trying to force her to put away her weapons, instead he will just be meeting her gaze steadily, waiting.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-19 08:21:44)

Despite Al'verde's suggestion to lower his weapon, Talon resists the urge to not comply. He instead lowers it slightly, the end of the bowcaster pointing to the floor. He hopes, however, that he can still get a shot off in case Raik continues her assault on them.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-08-19 09:08:58)

Raik pushed Lucien's hand off her shoulder, as she finished picking though the dead Zabrak's body. "You can give up the act now. I lost the baby."
She stands up, holding one of the thermal detonator's she found on the ex-bounty hunter, and set it on a deadman switch. She started to calmly walk leaves the cloakshape.

---

## Stark Mausser

### **Xychotic** (2009-08-19 11:54:18)

It may have seemed like Stark wasn't paying attention, but that would be a gross underestimation of his Jedi training. He looks to be paying attention to the surroundings and doesn't seem to notice as Raik leaves the ship. Even with the concealment of his mask, his face is chiseled in stone as he looks out into the world. After a moment, he glances at Raik, giving her the barest of nods in acknowledgment of her existence, giving her a moment if she wants to say anything before heading back to the Fortune's Fool, where recycled and filtered air is less claustrophobic than the mask that protects his face and eyes from this world's dust.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-08-19 13:26:39)

Al'verde watched Raik as she walked out of the ship and then glanced back at Lucien, but didn't say a word. He walked out following Raik and flipped on his comm and said something in Mando'a then shut his comm off. As the ramp to the *Spire* closed Al'verde leveled his rifle **"You're not taking that thermal on *my* ship"** he said with a low growl **"So drop it."** He glanced at his rifle to make sure it was still set to stun and the took aim at Raik **"Don't think I won't shoot. I've had to put down some of my own brothers before."**

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-08-19 13:30:39)

Raik wasn't heading towards the Spire, Her business was done in the burning Cloakshape so she left. When Al Demanded that she drop the thermal detonator, she did exactly what he wanted. She dropped the still active explosive so it rolled towards Al's feet...

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Alicia** (2009-08-19 14:07:45)

Stark opens the closed ramp to the Fortune's Fool, from the medbay he can hear Galen's grumbling as he tries to give himself first aid.
The detonator rolls toward Al'verde, the beeping increasing exponentially as it draws closer. Able to dodge away in time, he is only caught by some of the flying shrapnel and not the explosion itself. (14 damage)

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-08-19 14:13:17)

Al'verde brushed his armor off and sighed**"Ok time for you to take a little nap"** he said as he took aim and pulled the trigger. Despite being angry his training allowed him to keep his arms steady and he pulled the trigger. He watched as the stun blast connected with Raik but didn't know her down, however she wasn't looking too good so he knew one more should do the trick.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-19 14:18:54)

Talon winces as the flash of the explosion fills his vision, but recovers enough to aim his bowcaster at the relapsed Raik. He pulls the trigger.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Anonymous** (2009-08-19 17:20:01)

"Raik, stop think about you baby! Please." Kyle ignites his saber not wanting this to go any further.

---

## Stark Mausser

### **Xychotic** (2009-08-20 01:20:14)

He walks slowly into the ship, hearing the blast of Al'verde's gun and hearing the sound of Raik falling. It's like deja vu to him, his brothers and sisters fell in the same way. An armed and faceless man shooting them in the back, not even hesitating despite having served with them through thick and thin. He says nothing, sparing a brief thought wondering what turmoil is lurking in Kyle before going into the medbay to offer Galen some assistance. He thinks to himself, *Have you ever known that you were right, but desperately hoped you were wrong…*
He knows what would happen next. He doesn't want to think about it. There was a reason he was so hesitant to fight in the plaza or to go for the bounty hunter alongside Lucien. What happens next will come as a surprise to no one, the only thing Stark can do is try to help an ally.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-08-20 04:54:59)

Lucien is more disappointed and angry that both Al and Talon have decided to open fire on Raik then surprised, and does the only real thing he can think of to buy them time to realise how big idiots they are being by diving toward Raik to shield her unarmoured body with his armoured frame. He also winces as Kyle says the wrong thing clearly not having paid any attention to what Raik had said.
As he does so he says, "Do you really think so little of me honey? I've never had to pretend to be anyone other then I am with you."

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-08-20 08:54:00)

Lucien successfully manages to interpose himself between Al and Talon's blasts and Raik taking both of them to the back, each of them makes him stagger clearly in pain, but he manages to remain standing if only barely, half-collapsed on Raik. He says, through gritted teeth "Well that hurt more then I thought it was going to." he doesn't intend to offer any violence toward Al and Talon but he will stay between them and Raik preventing them from hitting her without going through him first.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-08-20 10:55:04)

Raik turns in time to see the two stun blasts that were intended for her catch Lucien instead. Her eyes widened as the man put himself in danger to protect her. Suddenly she's in motion, charging directly at Lucien and tackling him to the ground. With hands on Lucien's shoulders she starts to shake him violently. "WHY! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT! I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO DO THAT!"

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-20 11:43:43)

OOC: Talon's shot wasn't a stun blast. And I wish Talon had a little more to unarmed combat than a BAB...
Talon reloads his bowcaster and takes careful, precise aim at Raik as she angrily shakes the downed Lucien. "Raik, stop now!" Talon commands. "Calm down and let him go. This is your last warning."
Galen rests in the medbay, gauze strewn about the place. "I knew I should have refreshed my memory on basic first aid," he mutters as Stark arrives. Galen sees the look on his face. "Something wrong?" he asks. "Oh no," he adds, jumping to the wrong conclusion. "Someone didn't make it? Who?"

---

## Stark Mausser

### **Xychotic** (2009-08-20 14:49:00)

In an instant, Stark's distant and forlorn gaze snaps back into reality; he just raises an eyebrow in mild surprise. He taps the door pad, allowing it to close before pulling off the face mask, turning away from Galen as he wipes the sweat from his brow and cleans his hands. "Everyone is very much accounted for. What would give you an idea otherwise?"
Stark takes a look at Galen's work, "Need some assistance?"
Then he glances back down at his own condition and mutters, "Yeah, I know I could use a hand."

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-08-21 07:05:04)

Lucien smiles through the pain as he looks at Raik who is shaking him roughly as he lies on the ground, "Like you have to ask, I love you, silly." he barely seems to be paying attention to the existence of the others his eyes and attention totally on Raik.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-08-21 10:41:15)

"Fool." Raik says, before resting her head against Lucien's chest. She seems to calm down and simply lays there on top of Lucien's armored form.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-21 11:33:35)

Talon can only look at the two with combined expression of both surprise and revulsion. He disarms his bowcaster and glances at Al'verde. "What in the hells?" he asks.
***
"Even on a navy ship, I've seen that look on people's faces more times than I've wanted too," Galen replies. "And it usually means someone didn't make it. So, what happened, then?" Galen asks, tossing a medpack to Stark.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-08-21 12:43:55)

Al'verde glanced at Talon and this looked at Raik gripping his rifle *I don't care if she's coming around to her senses. She still tossed a thermal at me and she has to answer for that.* he thought as he walked over to Lucien and Raik **"Lucien I understand that you love her but she still threw a thermal at me and as the commanding officer I will not stand for that."** he said as lowered his rifle **"she has to answer for her actions."**

Lucien looks at Raik and strokes her hair with one hand, saying, **"Maybe, but at least I'm your fool."** and then looks around at the others and says, **"If you'd learn to stay out of the situations you don't understand, you wouldn't get hurt quite so often, I'll patch you up once we get back on the ship."**

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Avarna** (2009-08-21 19:53:36)

Raik closes her eyes, and seems to relax even more. She seems to be unaware of anything beyond Lucien stroking her hair. She only gets up to move, when Lucien has had enough of laying on the hard duracrete and wants to move aboard the ship. There are still two thermal detonators on her belt, as well as the pair of blaster pistols and collapsible force pike that she probably took off the dead bounty hunter as well.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-21 19:55:58)

"Sorry," Talon says, "but I do understand a thermal detonator being thrown at one of us quite well. Same with a dark Jedi losing control of her temper yet again," he adds. He reloads his bowcaster as Raik gets up.

---

## Re: First to Strike

### **Vash** (2009-08-21 21:51:13)

Al'verde looked down at Lucien and placed his rifle in his other hand **"You know something, doctor, I don't give a frak about thing I know and don't know. We're on a mission and we don't have time for this crap. She need to get her head back in the game or go home. I had to kill my own brother when order 66 went out in order to save a jedi. If I let my feeling get in the was then General Erdan would be dead, along with half my team."** as he spoke he lowered his rifle and pointed it at Lucien **"So cut the lovey dubby shit and get you fraking head in the game…both of you..or I will do what it take for the mission to succeed"** he said in a cold tone.
He continued to look at the two and slowly raised his rifle as he heard a voice talking to him in Mando'a. With out say a word he walked over to *The Spire* and unlocked the loading ramp, lowering it just enough to for him to climb in, and shutting it behind him.
Inside *The Spire* Al'verde stormed over to Matsun and grabbed him up by the neck of his armor, lifting him off the ground. He pulled his left fist back and got ready to beat Matsun to a bloody mess, but just held him there. **"Sarge, remember what Erdan told us before we disbanded. Our first duty is to preserve life, then we worry about the mission. You swore that you wouldn't lose another squad mate…well they're our squad now. We have to protect them…even from themselves."** As Matsun's words echoed around the two mandalorians Al slowly lowered him **"That is the only time you ever get to tell me what to do."** Al'verde said quietly.

### **hayabusa** (2009-08-21 22:00:40)

Talon can only shake his head at the two as Al'verde leaves. They're going to get us killed one day, he thinks as he heads back to the YT.

## Re: First to Strike

### **Darren** (2009-08-21 22:08:47)

Lucien watches Al head off surprised that he is still conscious, he was almost certain that Mandolorian was going to shoot him and then looks at Raik and says, **"Well that was a bit of a surprise, there is a bit more to him then I was expecting."** he then pauses for breath still clearly in a lot of pain and says **"I guess we should probably get moving honey and head back to the ship, so I can treat your injuries, and see if the others need medical attention."**

Remaining quiet, Raik reluctantly get off of Lucien and follows him into the ship. Her hand grasping one of the cylinder's on her belt and just holding the lightsaber for comfort. She never let Lucien leave her sight, and immediately found a corner of the medbay to sit in.

Talon returns to the cockpit of the vessel and begins to make sure everything's ready for take off.
Galen nods at Lucien and Raik as they enter the medbay. A few bloody gauze bandages have been tossed into the waste disposal unit as a relatively fresh one is being held to his side. "Like I said to Stark here," he says. "I should have kept practicing my first aid. Damn crab droid got me right in the side."

Lucien looks over Galen's injuries and says to both him and Raik, **"Those were pretty nasty things. Get on the tables you two and I'll see about getting you both fixed up."** he looks down as his armour and says, **"Then I should probably see about myself."** and gathers together his tools to start the time consuming process of putting people back together.

Al'verde looked at Matsun **"Go and grab that corpse. I want to see if he had anything useful one him"** he said as he pulled off his armor and walked into the cargo hold.

Stark stands back, letting the doctor work on Galen and Raik. He doesn't offer any complaint about his own injuries, practically fading into the background as he waits and watches. He slowly looks at the medpack he was tossed without actually using it. He looks at the mask he had to wear while outside, either at his own reflection, or to get an idea of the sort of person that hides behind such a mask from the world. He seems lost in thought, even as he is acutely aware of everything going on around him.
