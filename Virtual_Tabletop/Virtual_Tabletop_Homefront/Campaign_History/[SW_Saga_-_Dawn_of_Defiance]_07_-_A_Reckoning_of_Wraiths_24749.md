<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Session 49</span> transcript
**recap of the apartment's layout**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The safehouse that currently serves as a refuge is within one of these tiny middle-class zones. It is a small domicile unit in a sprawling, enclosed apartment block. Security is minimal, consisting of door locks and a roving guard armed with a stun pistol.
One apartment is used as a living area/barracks, and this is where you are put up for the night. Its three bedrooms are small, each offering few amenities outside of cots with military-grade blankets. The second, center apartment is where the loyalists meet to discuss politics, plan actions, and learn skills that aren’t typically taught in school. The three bedrooms here have been converted into a workshop, a computer room (with a small Holonet transceiver), and an infirmary. The workshop is also an armory of sorts, stocked with a number of small arms and explosives.
Unlike the other two apartments, the last unit appears to be a sparsely furnished habitation with little or nothing out of place. It’s used for meetings with individuals who aren’t members of the loyalist cell, and for entertaining guests. A loyalist couple live there as husband and wife, working their day jobs and acting like good Imperial citizens.

</details>

The day passes on slowly in the quiet tenement building. The inhabitants of the third level apartments go about their usual tasks in an attempt to stay busy. With Al's help the elderly chap, whose name you learn is Dalen, in the workshop finishes the repair on the droids and moves onto servicing some weapons with the young man, Hank, who arrived earlier.
Edwani took up shop in the computer room, where Janice goes about her usual routine of watching for anything worthy of note on various channels. Ed doesn't learn much more from the news she didn't already read from the HoloNet news articles except further exposes on the events at the Spire, with none of them really gleaning more information.
((Feel free to fill in the blanks as to what you've been up to all day. Be creative.))
When night comes Tero arrives back, coming in through the middle apartment, the same door he had left through. With his cane tapping heavily on the floor, he tosses his cape on the table along with a bag which makes a heavy thunk as it hits the metal table, and then collapses into one of the meeting room chairs, obviously exhausted from what ever he did that day. His eyes close, enjoying whatever peace he can get for the moment.

Galen spends the day bored. He walks around the hallways, not really having anything to do at the moment. He talks with some of the people there, trying to get a short history of the little underground cell that they've set up for themselves. He also tries to get any news from outside of the safehouse, as well. Most of all, he wishes that he was off Coruscant and back home on the *Resurgance*.
When Tero finally gets back, Galen is one of the first people in the group to meet with him. **"So,"** he jokes, **"any more news on the Baby Food Bombers?"**

Tero lets out a grunt, "**Your descriptions are being handed out to any and all security agencies. If you head out, you'll defintly want to attempt disguises and avoid any CorSec and Imperial patrols.**" he heaves a heavy sigh. "**They found Al's ship too.. no telling what they've been doing to it, though they haven't impounded it.**" He motions to the bag. "**Those are the parts Edwani wanted. If you'd excuse me,**" he says, dragging himself wearily to his feet. "**I'm going to get some sleep**."

Edwani collected the parts she wanted for Al's equipment. She looked them over to make sure they were all servicable, as she mussed. "They have it under surveillance for sure. Probably stashed a tracking beacon aboard. They didn't impound it cause they're hoping to snatch us up going back to the ship."
She then turns her attention to Al, "You should probably check on Matsun."

Al'verde had spent the day working on droids, striping down his armor, repainting it, and working out. He hated being cooped up and not being able to do anything was also driving him up a wall. He wanted to get out and do something or at least get some training in. He had already put a hole in the wall of his room and repaired it. He tried sleeping but the urge to get up and move would over come him and force him out of his bed.
As he sat in the barracks he kept the lights off and sat on one of the beds, resting his elbows on his knees and resting his chin on his hands staring off into nothingness. As Edwani said something his brain didn't register what she had said as he stared off only blinking every once and a while. He knew this was only the first of may days to come. He was not sure if his mind would still be all together after this.

Tee'ra used this spare time to make sure everything was ready to go. She packed up all of her datacards, her personal computer, and a few of the other items she had collected since having to flee. After everything was as ready as it could be, she walked over to one of the empty rooms and began some exercises with her lightsabers, which she had not had to use for quite some time. Though she regularly practiced all of the moves she learned, this time there was a sense of purpose in her movements.
The twin blue lightsabers whizzed through the air as she moved fluidly from one stance into another. Ambidexterity was one skill she had, and it was obvious to anyone who dared challenge her that she could wield both of her weapons as effectively as the other. As the sabers continued their dance, Tee'ra had to be uniquely conscious of the fact that she would have to be careful not to use the force while fighting lest she cause a disturbance that could give away her position. She was already careful, but when she left the relative safety of the safehouse, it would be even more important to protect the folks that could use her help.

[Session 52 transcript](http://dod.swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80:session-52&catid=11:dod-7&Itemid=49 "http://dod.swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80:session-52&catid=11:dod-7&Itemid=49")
Upon defeating the five Imperial Agents, the sounds of sirens begin to fill the air as they draw nearer to the building where the safehouse resided. With no survivors from their original assault, and only two of the Agents surviving the attack on you, you prepare to interrogate them, but with reinforcements on their way there isn't time. Making it out of the building just as the reinforcements arrive with the bound and gagged Pavel Trenol slung over Korv's shoulder, you find yourselves once again on the run.
Using the distraction provided by Edwani's bomb and Al'verde's trap, you manage to escape through a series of alleys. However, with your identities and possibly even your names potentially on the Empire's most wanted list, no place you can hide will be safe for very long as THE MAN HUNT BEGINS!

Despite what Al'verde had done he felt no remorse, no regret, not even the smallest tug at his heart. Almost like a switch, his attitude had done almost a 180. It some what pleased him to know what he had done. He was going to send a clear message to the Empire, Any one who so much as even supports them is free game now. If they were going to kill anyone who was even in the area, even if they were dieing or too mental unable to fight back, he was not going to spare any of them. He no longer had a reason to. They had show him how far they were willing to go. He may have fought for the republic but he was still a mandalorian. He was going to remind them why Mandalorians were so feared. He didn't care what anyone else thought, he was not going to be the leader of this new faction trying to oppose the Empire. He was just a solider. He was no longer a Gunnery Sargent, no longer part of any army, and he was not even fighting a war. He was just some merc with a good background and lots of skills.
As he looked around the planet only one thing crossed his mind...getting back his ship and getting the hell off this rock. He knew no of the other would look at him the same anymore. Part of him wanted that. They had all seen them as a friend or some form of amusement to pass the time. Now they would get to know the true warrior side of him. The cold hearted, straight to the point, tactical minded trooper that made his people proud. He finely turned and looked at the others **"We no longer have the time to hide. If we want off the rotting pile of scrap called a planet we need to get back to me ship as soon as we can."** His voice had no tone in it. There was no concern if the other agreed with him or if they were following. He had his own plan and if they wanted to get a ride with him off the planet they would stow it and deal with it. He was done playing babysitter and risking his neck for other people.

Galen remains silent after the Mandalorian speaks, but begins to follow him. Maybe the Imperial agent did deserve to die for what he did, he thinks, but he was no threat to anyone at the moment; a helpless prisoner already wounded from the battle. He would have to discuss this with the others once they arrived back on the *Resurgance*, and if that led to Al'verde being imprisoned: so be it.
At least, he thinks as he walks down the streets of the Coruscanti undercity, it would be good to get back to his new one with his friends and loved ones.
