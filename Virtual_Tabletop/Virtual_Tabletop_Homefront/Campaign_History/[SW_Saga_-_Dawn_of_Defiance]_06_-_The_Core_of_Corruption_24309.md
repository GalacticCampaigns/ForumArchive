Travel to the Deep Core takes a couple days, less if the hyperspace lanes are traversed.
Upon arriving at hyperspace buoy IC-772, a quick scan reveals a scene much like what was on the holoprojector. Hundreds of ships are in the area, following specific spacelanes from the buoy to their ultimate destinations. The standard Message to Spacers (METSOP) directs incoming ships to immediately contact Imperial Center control.

Edwani yawns as she makes her way to the bridge in her undershirt, but at least put on a pair of pants. She looks directly at Al sitting in the pilot's seat. "So do you wanna talk to them or should I?"

Al'verde, only wearing the pants of his jumpsuit that he wore under his armor, looked up "Oh you're awake" he says looking back at the controls "And don't worry I did take a shower " he adds with a smile. He thought for a second "The captain should always be the one that talks for a ship." he said flipping on the comm **"This is captain Al'verde Verd'yc of the *Shadow Spire*, requesting permission to enter Imperial Center space, over."** He cut the comm off and looked at Edwani **"Here we go."**

Kyle listen in to the cockpit, "Are we almost there yet? " Walking around in coveralls, thinking to himself that this is not a good idea.

### **Avarna** (2009-08-25 13:32:41)

Edwani grins looking at the Jedi, then holds a finger up to her lips and shushes him. "Keep it down.This is where he make an ass of himself and blows our cover."
The Arkanian Offshoot didn't honestly believe that would be the case, but she wasn't about to stop teasing the Mandalorian just because things where starting to get relatively serious.

"No, not him." Kyle smiling liking the new person's sense of humor.

### **Alicia** (2009-08-25 22:54:58)

An automated message is sent out from the control center requesting the ship's destination. Upon receiving it sends Al'verde the exact spacelane, Imperial Center Approach Vector ICAV-7A and it's requested that you proceed immediatly. From watching the sensors, it's determined that a new ship drops out of hyperspace near the buoy every few minutes.

### **Darren** (2009-08-26 08:04:59)

Lucien rather unlike usual is staying in his room and keeping to himself while the others are in the cockpit. As they have started to contact the planet, he sighs and stands up heading out into the main part of the ship looking for some communication gear so he can start looking into making sure they have an exit plan if everything goes sideways.

Galen looks through the viewport of the crowded cockpit of the *Firespray*, looking at the glittering jewel that is Coruscant. It had been only a few months since he had last seen his home planet in person, but the Empire can change things far too quickly.
The planet now seemed darker to him, the feeling of being home stifled quickly by the feeling that it *wasn't* home. Not anymore. Hell, it wasn't even Coruscant anymore.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Anonymous** (2009-08-27 11:13:06)

Being this close to what was once home brings back a flood of memories of friends that he know he will never see again. Kyle returns to his cabin to compose himself. ((Are we all leveling?))

## Session 40

### **Alicia** (2009-09-10 21:47:27)

Though there were some incidents upon arriving in the system (a near miss in one of the space lanes causing some systems to break down) and having to stop for the arrival of one of the Imperial Star Destroyers, the Shadow Spire finally makes landfall on Imperial Center. Customs agent Talee and his escorts of Stormtroopers inspect the ship and credentials. Finally he leaves, fining Al'verde and Galen for having expired weapon liscenses (500 credits each) which will have to be paid to Imperial Customs via credit account within four hours.
Since Al'verde landed on the pad reserved by Verana and Vrath on your behalf the first day of fees have been taken care of. Fees here are 100 credits per day, but security appears to be excellent here and the pad itself is well managed.
As per recommendation of Vrath and Verana, finding accommodations would be a wise course of action. Right now you are on tall spire flanked with dozens of vaguely cloud-shaped exterior landing platforms at multitudes of levels. Each being a massive cantilevered structure, which also forms a single bridge to the spire itself.
(Please include in your next post a description of what you are taking with you? Armor, visible/hidden weapons, etc.)

"Good old Imperial red tape," Galen chuckles as he packs the offending weapon into his bag, hoping to conceal it as best he can. His combat jumpsuit he also packs away. Right before he leaves the ship, he electronically transfers the fine from his alter ego's account into the Imperial coffers.
He steps out of the *Firespray* once again, getting a good view at the world that used to be his home planet. "Okay, everyone," he says, "Let's find us a place to stay."

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-09-11 10:48:03)

Edwani yawns, putting her hands behind her head as she walks around the landing pad. She was wearing her combat gloves, and had her heavy blaster in its hip holster. She was dressed in typical spacer garb, and no armor.
"So whats next, "Fearless Leader"?" She asks directing the comment to the mandalorian.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Darren** (2009-09-11 20:12:27)

Lucien was standing ready wearing a fashionable white shirt, and trousers, with a pair of vibro-daggers on his belt. He has a heavy looking bag slung over his shoulders containing a couple of other changes of clothes, his armour packed away neatly, as well as a pair of blaster pistols and vibro-swords, and of course his various medical tools (although he hopes this time he won't need them).
He seems a little surprised Al and Galen hadn't ensured their weapon licenses were up to date before they had arrived, he looks among the others checking out the equipment they decided to bring along (at least that they don't have concealed in their bags), and decides to wait for Al to answer Edwani's question before he starts moving out of the spaceport looking for possible places to stay that are fairly close to the spaceport just in case things go badly.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-09-12 12:10:12)

Al'verde looked around the the area and pulled up his bag, with his heavy repeater tucked inside **"Guess all those years on the outer rim tend to let things like that slip my mind.** He pulled his cloak over his left shoulder letting it cover his entire left arm. He double checked everything on his armor and adjusted his HUD to account for the missing cannon. As he looked back at the ship he walked over to the ramp and closed it before he punched in three different codes, locking the ship down.
As he turned back to the others he heard Edwani he looked at her **"Well at least someone here knows who's boss"** he laughed **"Well I think first thing we should do is find a place to stay. I don't think sleep in the ship would look good so I'll have to get a room as well."** he said sounding a little disappointed

Kyle looks around doesn't look much different. "Where should we go now?"

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-09-27 14:56:36)

Al'verde looked at the others standing around and threw his bag over his shoulder. With out a word he walked over and found a public directory. After downloading the info onto his bracer computer he looked around and found the closet place to rent a speeder. It only took the man a few minutes to come around on a unarmed 74-Z speeder bike.
Al'verde gave the bike a quick once over and handed the man a credit chip and flipped on his com **~"Hey you guys coming or what? I've got room for one on my bike but I'm not waiting around all day."~** he said before jumping on the bike.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **hayabusa** (2009-09-27 16:02:51)

Galen looks at the speeder bike and its driver, wondering for a second if taking the bike is perhaps the safest option. He shakes his head. "I think I'll get an airspeeder of my own, personally," he says. He coms the office that Al'verde did, falsified credentials in hand, hoping that this rental wouldn't suffer the fate of the last one.
EDIT: Corrected an error.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Darren** (2009-09-28 06:44:11)

Lucien doesn't feel the need to rent a speeder preferring to go for a nice leisurely walk through the city looking for some reasonable accommodation near the spaceport. He says to the other, **"I think I'll just walk, it'll be nice to stretch my legs after being cramped on that ship for so long."** And he starts off striding slowly and leisurely, giving plenty of time for people to follow after him or try and talk him out of it.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-10-02 18:09:34)

Edwani climbs onto the back of Al's speeder bike, and wraps her hands around his waist. "I think we wanna find rooms somewhere in the mid levels. Go to low, and it gets dangerous, Go to high and security gets tighter."

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-04 13:13:51)

Kyle seeing his options plans to follow Galen. "Galen hold on, I'll ride with you."

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **hayabusa** (2009-10-04 13:46:30)

When his vehicle finally arrives, Galen motions for Kyle to hop in. "Mid-levels," he mutters as he hears the Arkanian offshoot's directions. "Well, at least it isn't the lower levels. She's right about it getting dangerous down there."
Galen follows the others to an inn.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-10-04 16:55:19)

Al'verde smiled "Well the higher level are only an issue if your not willing to pay people. Besides it's only an issue if you start trouble. So I can drop you off but I'm getting myself a nice room for at least one night. So you coming with or am I dropping you off somewhere?" he asked as he started up the bike. He knew that Edwani was most likely right, but he also knew with some extra credits that the owners would just leave you alone. On top of that he needed some nice R&R, even if he was on a mission.
As he pulled up to one of the nicer hotels he took his helmet off and looked around "Yeah this'll do." He glanced back at Edwani "So am I getting a room with one bed or two?"

Kyle enjoys the ride and ask the cabi questions. "So whats it like living here since the Emperor came into power?"

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Darren** (2009-10-04 20:28:17)

Lucien continues his travelling on foot even though the place is indeed massive and it will take him awhile to get anywhere as he is in no real rush at the moment. He looks around the city as he walks and thinks about the various possibilities for accommodation that he sees as he is walking as well as what else he will need as he walks at a relaxed pace.
He suspects it might take a few hours to find a place given the size of the city, but he doesn't seem to mind that fact.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-06 16:47:55)

Wondering how safe they were in the center of the empire, he starts to look for landmarks in case they have to escape. ((Where are we in relation to the Temple, Senate...)) Galen I think we should get another ship and dock it on the otherside of the city just in case."

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **hayabusa** (2009-10-06 18:52:55)

Galen glances around the area briefly as Kyle studies it more. **"I really don't have the kind of credits to simply acquire a spare ship,"** he says. **"If worse goes to worse, we should probably head to the undercity instead of the sky. From what I've heard–and what little I've seen–it's a good place to go if you need to hide from someone. Probably even those Inquisitors."**
OOC: That's it, I give up with the colored dialogue.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-10-06 20:11:03)

Edwani road along with Al in an usual silence. When they reach the hotel, She casts the man a seductive smile. "One should be enough."
She then got off the speederbike, and walked over to the counter to wait for Al. Fully intending to let the mandalorian pay.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-10-06 22:30:53)

Al'verde looked at Edwani and sighed to himself as he walked up to the hotel He set his bag down and set his helmet on the counter "**I would like a one bed suit please"** he said setting down a credit chip with 1800 credits on it **"Don't worry I'll carry the bags."** As he glanced at Edwani he leaned down and grabbed his bag and smiled **"Oh don't try and kick me out of bed cause I'll fight back."**

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-10-06 22:43:45)

"Really? I though your rugged Mando types were uncomfortable sleeping in beds. You know preferring military cots, and the like." She replied with a mischievous glint in her eye.
Once the room was paid for, She snatched the admittance key from Al's hand and raced him to the turbolift.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-10-07 22:43:30)

Al'verde smiled "That may be true but I'm also a pilot and I enjoy nice beds every know and then." he says as he takes off for the turbo lift after grabbing his helmet. He raced off almost lighting up his jet pack but he knew that would be too much. Then he smiled as he glanced down at his leg and spotted his mesh tape. He knew that as soon as he caught up to her he would have no trouble taping her up. Then he could just take his time and walk to his room.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Alicia** (2009-10-08 00:00:48)

Galen and Kyle climb onto a second speeder rented by Galen. Both speeders (the other rented by Al'verde) are in good repair but are obviously used vehicles. They function well enough in the overcrowded traffic lanes.
With Galen following Al'verde they both stop outside one of the nicest high scale hotels in the area around the spaceport, which is practically on the other side of the planet from the Senate building and ruins of the Temple. The Imperial, almost overly lavish, has a valet waiting outside the door who eyes the four of you critically. Seeing you leave your vehicles he asks slowly to Kyle and Galen who remain outside, "Checking in, sirs?"
Inside the receptionist takes a look at the credit chip Al'verde placed on the counter and quickly swipes it. "Of course, sir. Under what name shall I place the suite under?"

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-10-08 00:17:38)

Al'verde glanced back **"Aelo, Aelo Sarken."** Al'verde turned back around and sprinted off after Edwani. Just as the doors were about to close Al'verde tossed his bag in between the doors, giving him just enough time to slip in and pull his bag in. As the doors closed he looked at Edwani "**You do know that this is my room right?"** he asked knowing that she really didn't care "Well I guess I'll just have to do something about this then" he said pulling the mesh tape, that had been taped itself, off his leg and pulling out some **"Now am I going to have to use this to make sure I'm not locked out of my room before I get there?"**

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-10-08 12:27:38)

Leaning forward, so that Al got a good view of her cleavage, Edwani then sticks the admittance card down the front of her shirt.
"Maybe." She replied with a mischievous tone of voice.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-10-08 12:54:15)

Al'verde didn't say anything as pulled the tape out as much as he could behind her back. Using almost all his strength he quickly crossed his arms as he pulled more tape out and tried to turn her around. He intended on wrapping her wrists and lower legs before retrieving the card.
He knew that she was teasing him and part of him was slightly annoyed but he knew if he played along no one would ask questions. He was also having a bit of fun and it was nice to have someone who wasn't questioning he every move or calling him boss. It almost reminded him of what life was like for him before the war.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-08 17:27:15)

"Yes thanks you." Kyle walks in looking the place over before heading to the checkin counter. "What do you have available?" smiling

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **hayabusa** (2009-10-09 12:06:46)

**"Preferably the rooms on the cheaper side?"** Galen adds with a slight frown as he mentally calculates his credit balance. ***Force-damned rental company ripped me off…***, he thinks. ***And I'm going to have to ask the cell for some pocket money for the next trip. If there is one…*** he adds.
**"Tohmas Gerens"** he adds, handing his false ID card with the same name printed on it to the clerk.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Alicia** (2009-10-14 11:41:59)

The receptionist glances at the false credentials not taking much attention to what he's seeing. "Do you have a reservation, Mister Gerens?" The man hands the ID back to Galen. "Otherwise I'm afraid we're booked up."
In the hallway outside Edwani and Al'verde's room an older couple passes by them and gives them significant, disdainful glares. They whisper to each other over the indecency of the young and the fact they allowed a non-human into the hotel. As they walked past to the lifts, they deliberate telling management.
Lucien continues travelling down the walkways devoted to the pedestrians of Imperial city. As he walks he notices the lack of the usual non-humans who had once made a living up on these levels. Every now and then he would also pass a public computer displaying a screen saver with Imperial propaganda. Having walked for almost an hour, he's only seen two other hotels besides the Imperial, which is the most prestigious.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **hayabusa** (2009-10-14 18:37:05)

**"I'm afraid not,"** Galen says to the receptionist with a slight frown. **"Can you offer us any recommendations in the immediate area?"**
*Dammit…* he thinks. *I do not like us splitting up like this…*

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-14 20:51:18)

Kyle not wanting the team split, "How much more for a reservation?" Kyle taps a credit chip on the counter with a smile.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Alicia** (2009-10-14 21:16:20)

The clerk smiles back at Kyle as he sees the credit chip. "Our rooms start at 500 credits a night for a one bed room and increase depending on the.. services you require."

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-10-14 23:33:25)

Seeing the human couple disapprove of her presences, Edwani turns to them and glares at them for a second. Then she turns to Al, pressing her body against his armored form forcefully enough to press the mandalorian against the wall. She then kissed the man with passion fueled by her short temper.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-10-15 00:29:26)

Al'verde looked at Edwani as she pushed him against the wall "What are you d---." his words were cut off as their lips met. As he arms wrapped around him he could help but to do the same. As he slowly pulled her face away from his he tried to hide his face, which was slowly turning red. "**Um…I think we should… um… continue this in the room. After all we don't want to give anyone a free show.**" he said trying to gather his confidence. He was able to put up with her before this cause he didn't take any of it seriously, he knew she was just teasing him cause he was the big bad mando, and he wouldn't do anything to harm her.
After taking a deep breath he looked at Edwani not knowing if she was going take this the wrong way or not. He glanced around and figured the couple was far enough away. He took a step closer to Edwani and took one more deep breath as he reached down he shirt and grabbed the key card as fast as he could. He pulled the card out and unlocked the door not saying a word *Something tells me this room is going to cost a bit more now* He thought as he dropped his stuff and sat down on the bed.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Darren** (2009-10-15 04:41:39)

Lucien walks into the last hotel that he had passed, and heads up to the clerk saying, with a smile, "I was wondering if you might have a room available?" expecting that they would especially since price isn't really much of an issue as far as he is concerned.
Once he has acquired the room he plans to store most of his equipment in it except for the few small weapons he kept on his person and a small medical kit, and then he is going to head back out into the city. He isn't exactly sure who he is looking for, at least he couldn't given them a name or describe them (not specifically anyway, as he is someone that looks like they are in a dangerous situation but capable of handling themselves, if in a little over there head at the moment), but he'll know them when he sees them.
He knows enough to know that it's unlikely he'll find what he is looking for on the higher levels of the planet, and so is going to head deeper into the city.

"Do you have a double? " Kyle thinking that he really needs an expense account for situations like this. "We can split the cost, Galen."

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **hayabusa** (2009-10-15 19:48:51)

Galen freezes for just a second as Kyle accidentally uses his real name. He thinks of trying to correct him, but stops short, hoping that the clerk didn't catch it--the names were similar after all--or simply believed that he had misheard. He hands the clerk his credit chip instead. **"In half,"** he simply says.
*Oh, man, if this mission goes sour because of this…*

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-10-16 21:46:49)

Edwani walked into the room after the Mandalorian, and immediately kicked off her boots, and shrugged off her jacket. She then sat down on the bed, and turned on the Vid set.
"So besides amusing myself making you uncomfortable, what are we supposed to do here on Imperial Center?" She asked having missed the briefing back aboard the *Resurgenc*e.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-10-16 23:30:02)

Al'verde looker at Edwani **"Well were looking for information on something called the Sarlacc Project. How and where we are supposed to get the information I don't know. I have a feeling that I'm just here to provide the ship and the guns for if something goes wrong. I know if I try to use any of my old connections that I'll be thrown in jail and killed the next day, but I'm going to worry about that tomorrow. I just plan on enjoying the nice bed tonight for a change."** he said as he stood up, walked over to one of the corners and slowly started taking off his armor.

---

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Avarna** (2009-10-29 23:44:58)

"I see. Well, I'm afraid I don't have any connections here on Imperial Center, and even if I did I doubt they could get us information on a secret Imperial project. I guess, we'll simply have to see if one of the others come up with something." Edwani says, yawning and stretching out on the bed. Only to stand up again, and start helping Al take off his armor. Once that was done, she pushed him onto the bed, and laid down on top of him.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Anonymous** (2009-10-30 16:02:56)

Kyle inspects the room that he an Galen were able to obtain. He decides to take the bed by the window. Taking a look to see what kind of veiw they have. "We need to hurry up I don't like being on this planet now."

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **hayabusa** (2009-10-30 20:05:50)

**"If it's about the name slip, I wouldn't worry about it much. They're similar names and it didn't look like he even noticed. I do agree with not being here for more than we need to, though. I don't think I like this city as much as I used to. Unless…"** he stops for a second, thinking about the original subject. **"Did you sense anything?"**

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Darren** (2009-10-30 22:27:14)

Lucien continues to head deeper into Coruscant, heading away from what would be termed the "safe" areas of the city and into the Underlevels of Coruscant, his eyes moving left to right scanning the people as he moves, clearly searching for someone in the crowd.
He doesn't seem to be terribly worried about what might happen to him, his eyes focussed and determined as he moves without hesitation through the lower levels.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Vash** (2009-11-03 20:14:07)

Al'verde looked at Edwani as she helped him out of his armor. It wasn't like he needed any help, but it was still nice to get out of the armor a bit quicker. He carefully set his helmet down on top of his armor and stretched his arms out as he got ready to pull some covers out to make the couch so he could sleep on it, however Edwani seemed to have other plans. As he was pushed back onto the bed he tried to stop her, but he was already off his balance, so it didn't take much for him to fall back onto the bed. As soon as she laid on top of him he knew she was just trying to mess with his mind so he just went with it. He pulled one of the covers lose and over top of the both of them. *I'll just wait for her to get bored with me then we'll both be able to get some sleep* he thought as wrapped one arm around her and folded the other on under his head trying to keep his mind on the mission

## Re: The Core of Corruption

### **Alicia** (2010-01-06 00:31:29)

Everyone at the *Imperial* finds the accommodations to be more than satisfactory, but with the outrageous fee per night it's not worthwhile to stay for an extended time. You still have to get in touch with the contact Captain Verena had mentioned to Galen, Kyle and Lucien (mainly as you three had lingered the longest after the meeting) due to the security concerns of a potential mole.
With the party split, Galen and Kyle sharing a room on the 100th floor and Al'verde and Edwani in a luxurious (by common standards anyways) suite on the 250th.
Al and Edwani, if they look out are afforded a spectacular view of the upper city of Coruscant. Especially of a large statue erected in Palpatine's honor in front of the Senate building. From here you can also see the ruins on top of a hill of which you can only assume was once the Jedi temple.

## Re: The Core of Corruption

Edwani giggled softly, and she make herself comfortable curled up next to the mandalorian officer. Was she having fun torturing the poor man? Of course she was.
"Tomarrow we'll have to start walking the duracrete I guess." the Arkanian Offshoot said with a yawn, Then fell asleep on top of the Mando.

As he gets settled in the expensive hotel room, Galen picks his comlink up from the stand he had put it on. First, he wires the fine levied upon him by the Imperial customs officers upon landing. Then, the pilot keys in the the com code given to him and the rest of the group by Verena. **"Hello, we just got into town and ran into a big problem. *We broke our droid…***" he says.

Al'verde sighed as Edwani curled him. He was hoping that she would have gotten bored but apparently she was just getting started. He let the thought slip out of his mind so he could get some sleep. He let his eyes close as tomorrows plans floated around in his head. He needed to regather the team and see about completing his mission. He wanted to get this mission over and done with so he could get some idea of sanity back, but mostly he wanted his ship back to where he didn't have to worry about getting jumped by a half-dressed Arkanian Offshoot messing with his emotions.

Al'verde awoke in the middle of this night as his eyes shot open. His nightmare ended and the only thing he could remember was hitting the ground in a puddle of his own blood. He took a deep breath and and sat up as he wiped the sweat from his face. He knew that he had been under a lot of stress and that Ed had only made things worse but now. Now it was affecting his sleep, he knew it had to stop. He slowly rolled out of the bed, trying not to wake Ed. and closed the door between the bedroom and the rest of the room. He then proceeded to move everything to the edge. After putting some short on he walked to the center of the room and closed his eyes. This wasn't a training ring nor did he have Matsun with him, but he knew how to refocus his mind. He took a deep breath and began to picture a battlefield in his mind.
Slowly the comforts of the room faded away and he could hear the battle around him. Blasters fired off from every direction. He could feel the heat as bolt flew past his body. He could smell the think stench of carbon in the air as armor was destroyed by explosions and blaster fire. The sound of debris bouncing off his armor echoed through his mind. Yet with all the chaos around him his mind was at ease. His body did not even flinch as bolts and missiles flew inches from his face.
He slowly opened his eyes and yet he could still see the battlefield around him. As if it was super imposed on the room around him. He took a fighting stance and began to go through the movements. Blocking a sword the countering with a hammer blow to the enemy's chest. His arm did not flow through but instead slowed down. His body knew what it felt like to hit a man in the chest and he knew what it felt like when his hammer began to break bones. He knew in his mind that he had just broken two if not three ribs and punctured the man's lung. He the turned and blocked and incoming axe with his forearms. He turned his torso and blasted the man in the face with his cannon. He continued through the fight not noticing anything around him but making sure he did not step outside his own little circle that he had made.

Edwani was a light sleeper. One didn't operate a starship by themselves without developing the habit of being ready the moment an alarm sounded. But even then the first thing she noticed was that the nice warm thing she'd been laying on was no longer there. It took her a few more moments to develop the desire to actually leave the comfortable bed and go look for Al.
She then heard the sounds of motion in the other room, and quietly slipped out to see the mandalorian going though unarmed combat drills. She remained silent until he was done, Before picking up one of the pillows from off the bed, and throwing it at him.

"Galen, is that an old friend." Kyle looks some what puzzled. I looks and to see what time it is now. "We should let the otheres know and leave early to recon the area a bit to avoid surprises." Kyle looks through his things looking for some clothes that would help them blend in better, while watching Galen.

**"I don't think so,"** Galen says as he terminates the conversation. **"He's our informant for the mission. He could be, but I don't remember serving with someone with his name."** The former member of the Republic Navy glances at his com again and begins to notify Lucien, who had walked away from the ship at the beginning of the mission.

**"Sorry for disturbing you, Lucien,"** Galen says as he hears the noble's voice tone. **"It's just that we found someone to take care of our *droid problem* and you're the one who wanted to know about it."** He puts a slight stress on "droid problem", hoping that Lucien remembered what the code phrase was, and also fearful that the Empire may be listening in on everyone on Imperial Center.

Al'verde/Edwani scene
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

** Al'verde felt the pillow hit him and turned to face the target. His mind was still on the battle as he quickly rushed Edwani, not seeing it was her. **
** Edwani saw Al turn to face her, and mentally cringed as apparently he was still in the grip of whatever battle he though he was in. She took a step back to open the distance. "Umm... Sorry?" she offers. **
Al'verde: Al'verde's palm hit the wall where Ed was standing as he slowly calms down "Sorry." he said pulling his hand back. "My mind was still on my battle there. I'm sorry I woke you."
Edwani: "Its okay. I'm a light sleeper." Ed replies, Stepping closer to Al and putting a hand on his chest. "Something bothering you?"
** Al'verde took a step back as soon as he flet Ed's hand on his skin "Yeah, just a few...personal issues. Normal when I'm like this I can spar with Matsun but I sent him off to try and retrain another clone. So I have to do this or else I'll make a mistake and get someone killed." **
Edwani: "Ah." Ed says, then smiles, and walks over to the spot he'd cleared. "Wanna spar with me? I might not be a clone trooper, but I bet I can make it interesting."
** Al'verde sighed "I'm not sure that's a good idea. I don't normal hold back and if I injure you the others will ask questions." **
Al'verde: normally*

** Al'verde falls back looking up at Ed "So you think you have me?" he asks tighting up his body **
Edwani: "No. Because you let me Pin you." She says, alittle pout on her lips, Then leans forward and kisses him on the lips. "Next time I pick the game Okay?"
** Al'verde is stuned for a moment as she kisses him. However as soon as she asys game he flexes his arms atempting to break the hold she has on him "This is no game! People's lives are in my hands and I have no home. Hell I don't know if anyone in the crew would trust me when this is all done. I'm simply a ride for them. That will all change as soon as you get your ship bak. I know you're probely a better pilot, I just have the better ship." **
Al'verde: Grapple [1d20+13+0] ![=&gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif) [13,13,0] = (26)
** Edwani doesn't resist as he turns it around and pins her. "Is that what this is about?" She asks, putting her hands on his if for no other reason then to make sure he wouldn't strangle her. "Listen, I might not know anyone too well. But I know I'd miss you." **
** Al'verde stands up "Why is that. I told you, nothing can happent between us. I have a personal honor code. I protect family and mates first. That means I could put the mission at risk to make sure you were safe." **
** Edwani sits up. "I might get around more then a zeltron on vacation." She said simply "But listen, Just because we do anything, it will be just that. A one time thing. I'm not Mando'a" **
** Al'verde sighed "That's the point. We are from two different life styles. You feel that you can sleep around with and male that fits your taste. I happen to be your current target I'm guessing. I'm sorry but if we sleep together I will not be able to simply let go of you. I admit, you are very attractive and I have been on my own for a long time. If we do this it will keep you from tormenting me further. I **
Al'verde: I'm just not sure idf I can let go so easily."
Edwani: "Fine." Ed says, standing up. "You know were to find me, if you get this straightened out." She says walking back into the bedroom, and laying on the bed.
** Al'verde sighs and balls his fist up "Why does everything have to be so fraking easy for others. I guess cause they're not on the run for the Empire due to treason. If I give in now she will simply move on to the next male. I guess I could use it as training." he said opening his fist. He slowly walked back into the bedroom "So if I say no will you still walk around my ship tempting me?" he asked as he walked over to the bed **
Edwani: "Maybe. Maybe not." She replied, turning to look at him. Already a nice bruise was forming on her stomach against her alabaster complexion.
** Wraith me sits down on the bed and sighs "I'm sorry. I did not mean to hurt you." **
Edwani: "Doesn't matter." She says, streching out on the bed. "night al."
** Al'verde lays down and wraps his arm around Ed "Good night." he says thinking about her offer **
Alicia: with that I think we should head to bed
** Edwani smiles, adjusting her position so she was laying ontop of him once more. "Atin Mando'a" **
** Al'verde smiles "Yeah but that's what saved a Jedi's life and put me in the service of this team. So you can blame that on allowy us to meet." **

</details>

With the meeting set for the next day, Galen and Kyle settle in to get what sleep they can. The room is comfortable by anyone's standards and the two men are afforded the luxury of two beds.
Morning comes quickly to the high rise hotel. Al and Edwani on the upper levels are the first to get a glimpse of the dawning sun.

Al'verde opens is eyes as soon as the sunlight hit his face. He sat up and looked around the room, last night's little talk still playing through his head. He looked over at Ed and sighed, part of him wanted to take her up on her offer but he knew it would cloud his judgment of what was important. He slowly got out of bed and walked over to his armor. He picked up the chest plate and looked at it. The weight of the armor didn't feel right without the blaster cannon but he knew it was better that he left it in his ship. He though about prepping himself for the day and looked around **"You know it's not often I get to stay in a place like this. I think I'll enjoy the luxuries a bit."** he smiled as he set down the armor. He walked over to the shower and turned the water on till it was hot enough. Then he closed the door before he took this shorts and tank top off and stepped into the warm water raining down on him, letting out a sigh **"I will miss this."**

Arriving at the enormous Cystalline Plaza, which true to its name, is dotted with intricate crystal structures and sculptures from around the galaxy. Beyond that, the plaza's main use from what you can see is as a transit stop and public thoroughfare. The ominous incomplete Imeici Spire looms over the plaza. True to rumors, the upper stories appear almost complete. Several levels at the base are also enclosed, but the vast majoirity of the lower tower is only a skelatal structure. There are elevator cores and other shafts seen through the structure which connect the floors. The tower is octagonal, with wedge-shaped towers at every other side, extending to become a complex antenna array above the top floor.
Pairs of guards patrol the area of the construction site and plaza at widely dispersed intervals.
A surprising sight greets, Lucien and Edwani as they enter the plaza. From the corner of his eye he spots Kyle speaking to a woman by one of the crystal sculptures. Discovering the compatible goal of needing to enter the Spire its agreed that cooperation is in order. After a confrontation with a guard when Callista had displayed her ascension gun, Lucien, Edwani and their new companion, Callista make to meet up with Galen who had parked the rental speeder a block or so away.
Meanwhile, Al met up with Tero Reskan, the Coruscant contact, who was willing to look into some valuable information for him. Promising to have it within the day they parted ways.
(( Note Joe: the class 3 transponder is now installed on the rental. I ask that since Callista is a new player that everyone (including Callista) type up a nice description in your next post. ))

Al'verde paid the tab for the two mens drinks as he walked out to his speeder bike. His blues eyes and and shot black hair might make some think he was one of the clones, but his facial features and scares would prove other wise. As he approached his bike he placed his helmet back on his head. His heavy Beskar'gam armor made him stand out anywhere he went, after all it was the Mandalorian armor. Anyone one who was on Geonosis would recognize the style, that along with the fact that he was just over two meters tall and almost 160 kg of muscle. The armor was the same style the Jango wore, his was a heaver and better armored version though. The light coming from the sun almost seemed to disappeared when it hit his black and gray armor, only the slight trim of gold caught the light. As his red cape gently fluttered in the wind he scanned the area before getting on his bike. As he HUD flickered on he opened his comm "Ok guys where are we meeting up?"

Edwani was an Arkanian Offshoot, very human in appearance, except for white skin and hair, with bright blue eyes. Because of the anti-alien sentiment currently on Courasant, she was wearing make-up to make her complexion darker in an effort to make relations slightly easier. She's wearing standard spacer garb, a nerf hide jacket, over a white shirt, and dark pants and boots.
"We're heading to the old Newport spaceport, to meet up." Edwani calls over her comlink to Al.

**"Well, now it's an apartment complex…"** Galen states as he readies to pilot the speeder to its new destination. He's a human male of average height and wears his dark brown hair short. He's wearing standard civilian clothes at the moment, albeit a little bulky. If one looks closely, you can probably see that he's wearing a combat jumpsuit under his blue shirt.
