### **Dreamwalker** (2011-01-13 18:59:20)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">SESSION 6; The fall of a Sith Aspirant</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The mesmerizing shock boxing match had just come to a shocking conclusion; Kava and Vorhees had both been bested in combat.
Tok &quot;The Shock&quot; was now boasting inside the ring, collecting his prize money and holo-title belt.
The Naval officers look on from their repulsor balcony, as Rue was dealing with the injured.
The faces of Kava and Vorhees looked like they had been through an Ugnaught nerf meat factory.
The echoes of the crowd was still resonating in the conscious&#39;s naval members ears.
The ensigns orbital platform landed next to yours.
(48074) Ensign Lorus: Well, that was interesting&#8230;ma&#39;am.
(48074) Ensign Lorus: What&#39;s going to happen now?
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue shook her head as she looked over both with one arm, making sure they were alright to be moved. Looking over to the nesign she frowns &quot;they&#39;re idiots, both of them. find a way to get a shuttle to his area unless you want to carry them.&quot; **
(48074) Ensign Lorus: We&#39;ll help move the wounded ma&#39;am.
** (48079) Commander Oturis heads down to where the wounded fighters are **
The arena started to slowly dissipate in population.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue nods and stands, motioning to the prone bodies &quot;get them up then.&quot; she looks over to the commander &quot;it&#39;s about time we left for that shuttle.&quot; **
The ensigns heads snap to the commander.
(48074) Ensign Lorus: Yes Ma&#39;am!
(48079) Commander Oturis: I agree.
The ensigns pick up Vorhees and Kava.
** (48079) Commander Oturis flips his encrypted comlink on and calls the shuttle, telling them to meet us on the roof of their current position **
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Support the head and neck ensigns.
Vorhees is shaken awake by the motion, and he sees the bright light of the arena filter into his eyes.
(48074) Shuttle Thyferra: Roger that sir, we have your coordinates&#8230;ETA 3 mikes.
** (48084) Sarin orders his pilot to punch in a channel to the party **
(48084) Sarin: Commander Oturis.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees blinks a few times before his vision finally returns to somewhat normalacy. He groans once at the bright light, but remains otherwise still. **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Alright everyone the shuttle is on its way.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue raises an eye to the groan &quot;looks like one decided to join the living.&quot; she sighs and begins to follow the commander, motioning the ensigns to follow. **
(48074) Ensign Lorus: Where we headed?
(48079) Commander Oturis: This is Commander Oturis
Commander Oturis&#39; comlink begins chirping…
(48079) Commander Oturis: To the roof…
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Roof, move it, watch your footing and do not jerk them about too much.
(48074) Ensign Lorus: Yes ma&#39;am.
** (48079) Commander Oturis taps his comlink against his hand **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Hello?
The ensigns begin moving to the way out of the arena.
They travel down the fighter&#39;s entrance path.
(48084) Sarin: Do you have an evac plan in motion?
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue glances to the commander as he answers his com, questioning look to her eyes for a moment before she was watching on to the ensigns. **
No one seems to much care about you all leaving.
However, a rodian dressed in semi-decorative clothing stops the ensigns.
(48079) Commander Oturis: We&#39;re working on it…
(48074) Rodian: Hi there.
(48074) Rodian: That was quite a fight your friends put on.
(48074) Heeden: My name&#39;s Heeden, I promote fights around here.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees looks around from where he was and waved weakly &quot;Thank you!&quot; **
(48084) Sarin: Do you need me to pick you up?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Negative.
(48074) Heeden: You guys have potential&#8230;you want my card?
The ensigns seemed confused at the proposition.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue narrows her eyes faintly to the rodian, glancing to the helmsman and back. She offers her hand for the card &quot;I will take it for him, he&#39;s in no shape to be moving.&quot; It was a pointed look given after to the helmsman to lay down and shut up. **
** (48079) Commander Oturis walks to the front, **
(48079) Commander Oturis: What’s the holdup?
(48074) Heeden: I understand&#8230;
(48074) Heeden: Well please, just give me a call&#8230;
** (48074) Heeden he chuckles, &quot;There is a lot of credits to be made in this business&#8230;and fame.&quot; **
(48074) Heeden: These two can at least take a hit.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees calls out to the Rodian, obviously pleased &quot;Trust me, you will hear from me soon!&quot; **
(48074) Heeden: Nobody usually last two rounds with Shock.
(48074) Shuttle Thyferra: ETA 2 mikes&#8230;on our way.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue nods her head faintly, pocketing the card in her top of all places &quot;He&#39;ll call if and when he is able.&quot; she remarks and looks to the ensigns &quot;move.&quot; She orders them, moving back the rodian with a nod. **
(48074) Shuttle Thyferra: We&#39;ve still got a fix on your coordinates.
(48079) Commander Oturis: Roger.
(48079) Commander Oturis: Alright, let’s get a move on people…
The rodian continued to move to the ring, and the ensigns bypassed him&#8230;following orders.
After moving quite quickly, the ensigns were carrying Kava and Vorhees&#8230;you spot a lift past the bustling fanfare of Coruscant passerby.
Kava awakes with Ensign Lorus carrying him.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Commander, would that be our ride I trust?
A quite attractive brunette human.
(48079) Commander Oturis: Alright everyone, were going to take that lift to the roof.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Ugh&#8230; Am I dead?&quot; **
(48074) Ensign Lorus: Yes sir!
(48074) Ensign Lorus: No sir&#8230;you&#39;re fine&#8230;
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue glances now to the second fighter that joined them again &quot;Be thankful you are not kava.&quot; She states, moving up to the ramp ahead of the wounded to watch over the progress. **
The ensigns get onto the lift&#8230;and push the call button to the roof of the collosseum.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;That is a relief. What a fight.&quot; **
(48074) Ensign Lorus: Hmm&#8230;
(48074) Ensign Lorus: We don&#39;t have clearance&#8230;.
(48074) Ensign Lorus: It won&#39;t allow us access to the rooftop.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees grins and says to his partner &quot;I knew that would be fun&#8230;and you said I’d get us killed, psh.&quot; **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Here let me try
(48079) Commander Oturis: [1d20+11] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [4,11] = (15)
(48079) Commander Oturis: [1d6+11] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [3,11] = (14)
(48079) Commander Oturis: [1d6] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [1] = (1)
(48074) Shuttle Thyferra : We&#39;ve got the coliseum sighted&#8230;.
(48079) Commander Oturis: [2d6] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [2,2] = (4)
(48074) Shuttle Thyferra : Beginning landing pattern.
(48079) Commander Oturis: Someone open this door.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue sighs and looks to the fighters &quot;Either of you know how to work this damned thing?&quot; **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava looking at Vorhees. &quot;Haha! Oh don&#39;t make me laugh.&quot; The pain being his reminder he was alive. &quot;That guy can hit.&quot; **
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees raises a hand &quot;I can&#8230;just turn me so that I can face it.&quot; **
(48074) Ensign Tyvek: Give me a hand Cedbat.
The two ensigns activate the lift and it begins ascending upwards.
(48074) Shuttle Thyferra: We&#39;ve touched down, all clear to board.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees growled at the Ensign and said in a dangerous voice &quot;If I was not in such a state&#8230;I would have used your head to activate it for that&#8230;&quot; **
(48074) Ensign Tyvek: Excuse me sir?
(48074) Ensign Tyvek: Did I do something wrong?
(48074) Ensign Tyvek: The commander ordered the lift to work.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue stands quietly, turning a glare on the helmsman &quot;Shut it Vorhees.&quot; **
(48074) Ensign Tyvek: I was following orders.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees rolled his eyes and he addresses the ensign &quot;And I said I would do it&#8230;you took my fun.&quot; **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Quiet…
(48079) Commander Oturis: Let’s just get out of here…
(48079) Commander Oturis: It’s been a stressful day for us all…
The lift ride continued for a few more seconds; then it opened to the windy night sky of Coruscant.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava looking at Lt.Rue and Vorhees smiling.&quot;When did you to get married?&quot; **
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: I&#39;ll give you a datapad to play with it while you&#39;re in the medbay if you don&#39;t talk again the rest of this trip.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Kava, keep in mind I can make your stay hell.
The Lambda class shuttle was whirring and blowing steam in all directions, drowning out your conversation.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees smiles at Rue and nods happily but holds up a finger, to say he had somethhing to add. &quot;If only I were so lucky Kava&#8230;&quot; **
The boarding ramp extended as you appeared on the roof.
(48079) Commander Oturis: Alright, let’s go…
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue moves out following after the commander, all things of medical murder that can look like an accident running through her head. Oh if only. **
** (48079) Commander Oturis screams **
(48079) Commander Oturis: LET’S GO
Rue notices the pain in her arm has increased&#8230;
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue winced faintly, rubbing her arm gently with her good one. a deep breath taken to push through, nearly to the ship..nearly there. **
You all board the ship, and it immediately heads for orbit.
The reassuring sound of the landing ramp closing is music your ears.
** (48079) Commander Oturis walks up to the pilots **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Patch me through to the Subjugator.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue directs the ensigns where to rest their charges while taking a seat herself, eyes closing to continue happy thoughts and assess what needed to be done once in her medbay. **
(48074) Pilot Naezh: Yes Sir.
(48074) Pilot Naezh: Channel Open.
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Shuttle Thyferra&#8230;How can we assist?
(48079) Commander Oturis: This is Commander Oturis, the Captain was murdered on the planet’s surface, I&#39;m taking command.&quot;
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir?
(48079) Commander Oturis: The situation will be fully explained once I have arrived, I&#39;m taking command per order 66-103.1
(48079) Commander Oturis: My code clearance is yxcs31043.
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir I understand&#8230;do you have his remains?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Negative, we&#39;ll retrieve them at a later date.
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Roger Sir&#8230;once onboard&#8230;you have the deck.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue glances over to the commander, hopefully this one wouldn&#39;t turn into an idiot or a coward. **
** (48079) Commander Oturis settles into a seat for the ride back **
The shuttle breached the atmosphere.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava listens to what is going on in the shuttle on the ride to the ship. The commander was letting the rest of the crew know what happened and taking control. He was hoping he could protect this one better then the last. **
You are now in orbit&#8230;and you see the awe inspiring Subjugator in the distance.
(48074) Pilot Naezh : 3 minutes out sir.
** (48079) Commander Oturis looks at the star destroyer with awe, it’s awesome power always filling him with awe, and now it was all his, for now **
There were other smaller ships in orbit too&#8230;but they were keeping their distance from the Star Destroyer.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue glances to the ship and frowns, looking back to commander and pilots &quot;Would one of you three send word to the medbay to expect wounded and to prepare the beds.&quot; **
(48074) Pilot Naezh : Yes Ma&#39;am.
They transmit the order.
(48074) Pilot Naezh : Order Confirmed Ma&#39;am.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Thank you.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees was just resting now, so happy to finally be going back to the ship that he piloted. &quot;Miss Rue&#8230;I&#8230;have a request.&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Commander Oturis, we&#39;re prepared for your arrival. The men are in formation.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: &quot;Lieutenant Rue.&quot; she corrects &quot;What is it?&quot;
(48076) Lieutenant Vorhees: Lieutenant&#8230;My apologies. May I be patched up, at my station?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Roger, any formalities will have to wait, have the men take their stations
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Your request will be considere
d.
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Roger that Thyferra.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava resting where he was on the ship. &quot;What of one who killed the Captain? He seemed interested in getting on board.&quot; **
(48076) Lieutenant Vorhees: Piloting is my life, Kara. I -need- to be at my station&#8230;
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue nods her head to Kava&#39;s notion &quot;He needed to speak to the admiral I believe.&quot; she looks over to the commander, for now ignoring the helmsman &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we send word of that?&quot; **
(48079) Commander Oturis: I&#39;d rather tell the admiral once we&#39;ve reached definitive safety.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: With all due respect. If he&#39;s wanting to join then we should be sending word now.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: A fighter of that power would be well received with us.
The pilot informs you that you are docking now, and to buckle in your crash webbing.
(48079) Commander Oturis: You do your job Lieutenant, let me do mine.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: My job, commander, is to protect the quality of life on our ship; he can help to defend away teams and missions. Contact the admiral.
** (48079) Commander Oturis says in a neutral tone, they all had their roles and he was doing his job the best way he knew how **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava Looking at Rue. &quot;The only thing I intend to do with that scum if he thinks I’m willing to allow him on the ship is gut him and send his remains out the nearest air lock.&quot; Kava was serious about what he was saying. **
The shuttle lands within the hangar bay.
** (48079) Commander Oturis ignores Rue **
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Lieutenant you are in no position to be making threats on anyone.
The landing ramp extends.
The pilot orders, all clear to disembark.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava, &quot;Nothing a bacta tank won&#39;t cure.&quot; **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue stands with a frown &quot;If you will not, I will.&quot; She states, making for the ramp to send out a message **
(48076) Lieutenant Vorhees: Already you are a fool Commander&#8230;Just saying. If one of your crew has a valid point, it is -your- job to consider it.
** (48084) Sarin punches up his comm &quot;Commander Oturis, this is Sarin.&quot; **
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Ensigns, get the wounded to the medbay.
The ensigns executed their order&#8230;hauling off vorhees and kava.
(48076) Lieutenant Vorhees: Hey hey! What about my request Lieutenant?!
The massive hangar bay was alive with activity&#8230;officers and TIE pilots were running in every direction.
** (48079) Commander Oturis exits the shuttle and immediately heads towards the lift to the bridge **
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Fine. Put him in his chair and make sure he doesn&#39;t move.
(48079) Commander Oturis: Sarin, this is Commander Oturis.
The Lieutenant catches up with Oturis.
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir, what&#39;s going on?
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue follows after the Commander, sliding into the lift with a frown, &quot;You know I&#39;m right. Why will you not contact the admiral. Because of what he did?&quot; **
(48084) Sarin: Commander, do I have clearance to dock?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Yes, I’m just taking charge of the ship at the moment and informing them of the situation.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: You need to contact the admiral anyway! Chain of command needs to be informed of the events and your new position for official purposes! It will only take a minute longer.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava looks around the docking bay. Pilots and personnel running here and there attending to their duties. Looking at one of the Ensigns. &quot;Get me a Tactical read out ASAP.&quot; **
(48074) Ensign Lorus: Sir, we have orders to take you to med bay.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava looking at the Ensign. &quot;I know what your orders are! I told you to get me that report so step to Ensign.!&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: I see sir&#8230;
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia: Well we are making the preparations.
** (48079) Commander Oturis looks at his comlink, he&#39;d have to get to the bridge before he could contact Sarin **
Commander Oturis, Lieutenant Cmdr Yeliab, and Lieutenant Horcia arrive on the bridge.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;I also want a squad of troopers on standby incase I need them.&quot; **
** (48084) Sarin brought his ship within range of the massive Star Destroyer &quot;Sarin to unidentified star destroyer, I need to speak with your Commander&quot; **
The aura of official duty wisps into Oturis’ face.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue mumbled faintly under her breath, rubbing at her arm again, with another wince. Moving out onto the bridge with the Commander, motioning the ensign to the helmsman&#39;s chair &quot;Put him in it then go and find me my medical kit.&quot; She orders. **
** (48079) Commander Oturis steps out onto the bridge walkway, a newfound sense of purpose filling him **
The crew begin taking up their positions despite their injuries.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees sighs in comfort as he sits in his chair, hands going to trace over the controls. **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Sarin, this is Commander Oturis of the Imperial Star Destroyer Subjugator.
(48074) Commsman Elkin: Sir, we are receiving a hail from an unidentified vessel.
Some officers rush to get medical equipment for Rue and Vorhees.
The massive control stick lay in front of the Helmsman, and he looked in horrible condition. The other helmsman looked at him quizzically as he took his post.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue watches the commander while she waits for her kit. Once it arrives to her she moves over to the injured to tend to him in what she could. &quot;I may do what I can here but you will report to the medbay when you finish your shift.&quot; **
(48084) Sarin: Ah Commander Oturis; this is Sarin do I have permission to dock?
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees nods to the woman with a grateful smile. &quot;Of course Doctor.&quot; **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Please proceed on your present course.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees wondered why the commander never said whether he had permission or not, and filed this under suspicions. **
** (48084) Sarin takes the controls and pulls the ship up under the destroyer slowly making his way into the hangar bay **
Sarin&#39;s ship is on approach to the Star Destroyer.
** (48079) Commander Oturis flips the comm over to loudspeaker **
(48074) Lieutenant Elna: Sir&#8230;are you in condition to be lead helmsman? You look like you should be in sick bay.
(48079) Commander Oturis: SARIN, for crimes against the EMPIRE and the MURDER of Captain Narweld I carry out immediate retaliatory justice, GUNNERS FIRE ALL BATTERIES!!!
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees immediately moves the control stick and tries to steer the ship -away- from Sarin&#39;s position. **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue frowns faintly and takes her kit, &quot;He should be.&quot; she retorts &quot;You have five minutes to get your fill of the seat before I drag you to the med bay.&quot; Turns to the commander in shock, &quot;What are you doing!&quot; **
The gunners target the Sith Infiltrator with heavy turbolaser batteries.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue turns to round on the other helmsman since the wounded one was rather..unable &quot;you want to keep your career, you turn this damn ship away from that one out there or so help me I will make your children suffer when the admiral hears of this.&quot; *
The Helmsmen begin moving the Star Destroyer away from the Sith Infiltrator.
It moves away 6 squares.
(48079) Commander Oturis: All gunners engage!!!!
The gunners lock onto the Sith infiltrator and fire.
The Sith infiltrator is completely destroyed.
(48074) Gunner Orrik: Sir, enemy vessel destroyed.
(48074) Lt Horcia: Roger that sir.
(48074) Lt Horcia: I&#39;ll deploy a shuttle and retrieve the wreckage.
(48074) Lt Horcia: Shall we stay on red alert?
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue rounds on the commander &quot;You&#39;re an idiot, of all the times to be an idiot you choose the time when we could have gained a valuable ally! He threw Kava without an effort!&quot; She shakes her head and moves to the lift &quot;the admiral, will hear of this.&quot; **
(48079) Commander Oturis: No bring us back to normal, and patch me through to Coruscant security, I need to inform them that their situation has been contained.
(48074) Lt Horcia: Yes Sir!
(48074) Comms Officer Ororan: Sir, patching you through.
(48079) Commander Oturis: I’m sure he will, It will be in my full report.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Mine as well.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Yes Subjugator?
(48079) Commander Oturis: This is Commander Oturis, we&#39;ve dealt with the security problem you had on the surface.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue enters the lift to move to the medbay, medical kit in good hand. **
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Which one are you referring to?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Falsoor annex, Urbid city.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Let me check the logs.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Yes&#8230;.we have a wanted suspect for murder.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: He appeared to be wielding an energy sword of some type.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Have you apprehended him?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Yes he&#39;s been dealt with, if you picked up the energy signatures that were just unleashed outside your orbit.
(48079) Commander Oturis: He&#39;s been destroyed…
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Ok&#8230;we&#39;ll scan now&#8230;could you give us the coordinates?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Roger…
** (48079) Commander Oturis has the navigation officer transmit coordinates **
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Received&#8230;
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Definitely some residual energy&#8230;
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Was he a threat to you?
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue steps off the lift to her medbay, for now ignoring her staff as she moves to her office to send word to the admiral of her report upon the surface and the attack upon the ship of a potential imperial. **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Yes, he attacked us on the surface.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Ok&#8230;we&#39;ll need some of your crew for a hearing&#8230;could you dispatch some emissaries to the authorities on Urbid?
(48079) Commander Oturis: By hearing I hope you do not mean trial?
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Just send us four of your emissaries please.
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: We don&#39;t wish to keep you, but you will be held accountable for their actions.
(48079) Commander Oturis: Unfortunately I can only be relieved of two at the moment.
** (48079) Commander Oturis already had an idea of who he would send **
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees looked smugly at the commander and crosses his arms, and just sits back. Oh how he hoped that this would end badly for this bantha&#39;s ass. **
** (48079) Commander Oturis unfortunately he could not run his ship without them, the ensigns had an understanding of what happened, hopefully they wouldn&#39;t get in two much trouble **
(48079) Commander Oturis: I&#39;ll send some of my personnel down shortly, can I get a landing authorization for them?
(48074) Coruscant Orbit Control: Yes, please proceed immediately.
Meanwhile, Rue&#39;s HoloNet projector fired up in her officer.
(48074) Onslaught Comms Officer: This is the Onslaught&#8230;what is your business?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Send the ensigns that accompanied us to the planet.
The order is carried out.
(48074) Lieutenant Horcia : Well, how is the ship?
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: This is Lieutenant Kara Rue with a report of the meeting and events under Captain Narweld.
(48074) Onslaught Comms Officer: Yes, and who do you wish to speak to?
(
(48074) Onslaught Comms Officer: What profiles?
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Admiral Orcin please.
(48074) Onslaught Comms Officer: Have you requested mast Lieutenant?
(48074) Onslaught Comms Officer: Has this been taken up with higher authorities on your ship?
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees whistles in a high-pitched tone, just because he can. **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue nods her head, well&#8230;the commander was told at least &quot;I have.&quot; she states. **
(48074) Helmsman Darkrott: So you&#39;re the new lead helmsman huh?
(48074) Onslaught Comms Officer: I&#39;ll notify the Admiral then&#8230;standby.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees nods his head to the helmsman and says &quot;That I am&#8230;&quot; **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue leans back into her seat, rubbing her arm again **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant Vorhee&#39;s you may want to use this opportunity to head down to the med bay.
(48074) Helmsman Darkrott : What happenened to you guys down there?
The Display lights up with the older beared human, distinguished by his royal white uniform and stacked ribbons. He wore gold shoulder tassels. He assumed a rigid stance on the Holo display.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: This has better be worth my time Lieutenant.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Make it quick.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to Oturis and says in a flat tone &quot;I may, but it is rude to interrupt.&quot; Turning his attention back to the helmsman he explains &quot;What happened, is that the captain was killed by some big overgrown freak. Rightly so in my opinion, he was a coward&#8230;and had apparently done something incredibly wrong.&quot; **
(48074) Helmsman Darkrott: Was that the one we just vaporized?
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava after being treated in the med bay quickly heads to his quarters to change into a uniform and heads to the bridge. **
The ensigns arrive on surface.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees nods his head. &quot;Yes it was, though when you say we&#8230;leave me out of it. I would have much rather have had him for an ally than to have blasted him away like that.&quot; **
** (48079) Commander Oturis flips on his comlink, &quot; Lieutenant Kava can you and a contingent of stormtroopers meet me on the bridge.&quot; **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava apon stepping on to the deck of the bridge. &quot;Lt. Kava reporting for duty Commander.&quot; **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue sits up straighter in her seat &quot;Sir, Captain Narweld was murdered on the planet surface by an assailant wielding an energy blade of red coloring. Mostly cybernetic in physical appearance.&quot; She starts &quot;he wanted only to kill the captain and then to speak to Admiral Reyis of joining the imperial force. Sir this person may have committed a great crime but he was able to lift Lieutenant Kava without touching him. Commander Oturis assumed control of the ship and shot this person out of existance.&quot; **
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Moff Reyis?
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: He wanted to speak to Moff Reyis?
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue nods her head &quot;Yes sir. **
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: I see&#8230;an assassin perhaps&#8230;never heard of that type of assailant though.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: I will inform Moff Reyis immediately.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Meanwhile, I want your key officers assembled in your briefing room to give me an after action report. Is that clear Lieutenant?
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: One hour.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Yes sir. One hour.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Anything else Lieutenant?
(48079) Commander Oturis: Kava did you get those stormtroopers I requested?
No stormtroopers were present on the bridge.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes sir they are on Standby if needed.&quot; **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Roger have them come up to the bridge.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue had to think for a brief moment before speaking &quot;Sir he seemed genuine on joining the remnant, he could have killed all of us, but didn&#39;t, he could have fired on the ship but didn&#39;t&#8230;I believe we lost a valuable ally.&quot; **
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: He did kill Captain Narweld&#8230;can&#39;t say I blame your commander.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: But, I will get this information to Moff Reyis. I am max attentive to this situation.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: With all do respect to the captain, he ordered the door to the Falsoor building sealed with people inside, and ran.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Sir.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes sir.&quot; Switching on his comm link. &quot;Sergeant, report with your squad to the bridge.&quot; **
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Lieutenant&#8230;.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Save it for the after action report.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Yes Sir. Sorry Sir.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Don&#39;t apologize&#8230;just execute&#8230;anything else you &quot;feel&quot; I need to be aware of?
A squad of twelve stormtroopers arrive on the bridge.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: No Sir, nothing that can&#39;t wait for the full report. I will arrange for the meeting.
The crew on the bridge immediately take notice of the men.
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Excellent, carry on. Onslaught out.
The display cuts off coldly.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Troopers awaiting orders sir.&quot; **
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees rolled his eyes at the troopers that arrived, wondering just what in blazes he needed them for. **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Ahh, troopers can you please escort lieutenant Vorhee&#39;s here to the med bay, if he should &quot;stumble&quot; or &quot;fall&quot; would be of no concern to me.
(48074) Helmsman Darkrott: Something you don&#39;t like Lieutenant?
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees looked to the troopers and glared &quot;I am sorry, but I will be going nowhere right now.&quot; **
(48074) Helmsman Darkrott: Oh&#8230;
(48074) Helmsman Darkrott: Seems they are here for you.
(48074) TK 212: Yes sir!
The stormtroopers move up to Lieutenant Vorhees.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Sir, that will not be necessary I will escort Lt.Vorhees to the med bay. **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue leans back into her seat a moment and sighs. rubbing her head with her good hand before turning to her com for the officers &quot;Commander, Kava, Vorhees. Please join me in conference room for meeting in 1 hour.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Sir, with us&#8230;please.
(48079) Commander Oturis: No need Lieutenant I&#39;d like you to take your place on the bridge.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the trooper and shook his head &quot;Doctor said she’d be ready in one hour. Won’t do any good to get there beforehand.&quot; **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Sir this is not necessary.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Sir, I have orders from the commander&#8230;follow us.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue stood and moved to her staff, taking a seat on a bed, she waves a staff member to her to finally have her arm properly looked at and patched up. **
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees shook his head and said the same thing to the commander as he sits down in his chair. &quot;I refuse to move, until the doctor says that she is ready.&quot; **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava looks over at the Sergeant. He gives him a look that if anything happens to Vorhees there would be hell to pay. **
(48074) TK 212: I will not ask you again Sir.
(48074) TK 212: We will be forced to move you to the medbay.
(48076) Lieutenant Vorhees: Do I look like I am in any condition to walk? I was carried in here.
The stormtrooper picks up Lieutenant Vorhees&#8230;(unless he resists)
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava takes his post. **
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees does nothing and gives the commander the finger. **
The stormtroopers escort Vorhees to the med bay without further incident.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Sir. Lt.Vorhees has not done anything to warrant this treatment.&quot; **
The helmsman looks amongst themselves and whisper as he is carried away.
** (48079) Commander Oturis nods, what has the empire come to with this rampant insubordination and complete disrespect of rank **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue moves her arm slightly to get it comfortable before sighing. At least it was better than the patch job on the surface, and it stopped hurting; added bonus. Looking up as the stormtroopers enter she raises a brow and motions to a bed &quot;Put him down. And then you explain what a wounded helmsman needed this kind of escort.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Orders from the commander Ma&#39;am.
(48074) TK 212: They are absolute&#8230;as I&#39;m sure you are aware of.
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: and you thought it necessary for all of you.
** (48079) Commander Oturis radios TK 212 **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;That maybe sir but protocol still needs to be followed.&quot; **
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees says to the stormtrooper &quot;Absolute my ass. As soon as I can I will be voting no confidence in the commander.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Yes Ma&#39;am.
(48079) Commander Oturis: TK-212 this is the commander, once the helmsman is patched up please escort him to the brig until he shows some respect.
(48074) TK 212: We were given orders.
** (48074)The Stormtrooper responds into his integrated helmet comlink, &quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot; **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue sighs anad shakes her head &quot;Nevermind, take a seat or leave.&quot; She says turning on the helmsman &quot;and you. Quiet down, or I will put you under.&quot; Dhe looks over to her staff &quot;Get him ready for surgery.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Alright men, you heard the commander&#8230;take positions.
The Stormtroopers fan out in the bustling med bay.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees would have to end up killing the commander himself if he kept this up. **
(48075) Lieutenant Rue: Stick to the walls! If you&#39;re staying out of our way!
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;If I may sir. Confining him to quarters would be the correct action sir.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Yes Ma&#39;am..
A Lieutenant scans the helmsman.
(48079) Commander Oturis: I understand your sentiments lieutenant, he won’t be there for long, I just can’t have blatant acts of disrespect in front of the other crew members, it’s bad for morale
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Understood sir.&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: The Med Scan is not picking up anything serious.
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: He doesn&#39;t require surgery.
The med bay cuts to an embarrassing air.
(48079) Commander Oturis: We do have a meeting to attend farily shortly, lets everyone get freshened up a bit before then.
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: He just has a few bruises&#8230;bed rest and some pain medication should cure him.
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: Lieutenant Vorhees, would you like something for the pain?
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Of course sir.&quot; **
(48079) Commander Oturis: Lt Commander Yeliab, you have the con, I&#39;ll be in my quarters if you need me.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue mutters faintly as she reexamines his wounds under better lighting. She&#39;d like to not have to resort to surgery however&#8230;well&#8230;.he did take a number of hits. Glancing to her staff she takes the scan to look him over as well. And nods, &quot;good. All the better.&quot; she looks over to her staff. She wasn&#39;t embarrassed in the least, it wasn&#39;t as though it was easy to tell what he might or might not need on the planet without her gear. She does however look over to Morran with a long look &quot;are you finished?&quot; she asks. there was correcting a mistake, and then there was taking things too far. &quot;get the meds.&quot; she adds, moving off to grab a blanket or two more and a better pillow for resting. **
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: Yes ma&#39;am.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the Lieutenant Morran and shook his head. &quot;Not now, but for when I am in the brig then yes. But I -will- be attending this meeting, is that understood?&quot; **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue raises a brow &quot;You&#39;ll take them now. You&#39;ll sleep, and we&#39;ll wake you for the meeting&#8230;.what&#39;s this about a brig?&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: If you take something for the pain it would be very conceivable for you to attend the meeting
.
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: Just so long as you return to bed rest afterwards.
Lieutenant Commander Yeliab nods to the Commander.
** (48079) Commander Oturis heads to his quarters, and changes into another freshly pressed uniform **
(48074) Lieutenant Morran: So what would you like Lieutenant?
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava after the Commander leaves the bridge. Kava shakes his head. Either the Commander had become power mad or was just enforcing discipline he didn&#39;t know but he was going to keep a close eye on the Commander for the time being. **
A Lieutenant stands from the tactical interfaces and approaches Kava.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees rolls his eyes and nods then. &quot;Fine.&quot; He says with a shrug &quot;I don’t care, just get me whatever you can so that I am still able to get to the meeting.&quot; **
Lieutenant Morran gives him an injection and he is now normal on the condition track.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava swichting on his comm &quot;Sargent report. Has your orders been carried out? Over.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: He&#39;s arrived at Med Bay.
(48074) TK 212: He&#39;s receiving treatment, and then he is to be taken to the brig.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Very good. What does the good Doctor say about his condition?&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Just some bruises and cuts.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue drapes a blanket over the helmsman and moves back to let him rest a while, she pauses by a trooper &quot;what was that about a brig trooper?&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Nothing serious.
** (48074) TK 212 faces Lieutenant Rue **
(48074) TK 212: Ma&#39;am, he is to be taken to the brig after his treatment is completed.
(48074) TK 212: Per orders from the commander.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Understood. Follow your orders and see that Lt. Vorhees comes to no further harm. Is that Understood Sergeant?&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Yes sir.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Very well. Lt. Kava out.&quot; **
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue raises a brow to this &quot;and the commander ordered this I suppose. His treatment will be completed when he is able to walk under his own power. A brig is no place for rest or healing.&quot; she motions to the trooper &quot;however he will need a uniform for the meeting, will you send one of your men to retrieve one for him.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212: Yes Ma&#39;am.
One of the stormtroopers leaves to retrieve a uniform.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue nods her head in thanks &quot;relax a while.&quot; she states, moving to retrieve a uniform for herself as well. She had been known to sleep in a back office, so she often kept clothing, she was fairly certain someone would have heard of her odd habits. **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava returns to his tactical station and checks over what has been happening seen they were gone. **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: So&#8230;.you&#39;re the new gunnery chief?
A human with black hair and beard approached Lieutenat Kava.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees nods his head and smiles thankfuly to her. Looking over to a trooper he says &quot;You. Tell Kava I said thank you for his help on the bridge.&quot; **
The stormtrooper follows the order.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes. I am Lt. Kava.&quot; He turns and extends his hand. **
The two men exchange handshakes.
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: That was something else&#8230;first time I&#39;ve destroyed a target.
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: Question is&#8230;not sure who hit him&#8230;an invigorating experience.
Vorhees receives his naval gray uniform.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;I would like to say that is was my frist time as well that is impossible. I have been at war most of my life.&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: No kidding right?
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: This job should be nothing for you&#8230;.you know&#8230;arbitrarily exterminating targets.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue dresses into a proper uniform, stowing her new clothes away. Rejoining the med bay she takes the uniform, setting it off to the side for later, she&#39;d have someone help him dress in a while, for now he could enjoy the resting **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes, I was a soldier so pulling the trigger is reflex. A matter of training is all.&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: Oh&#8230;you were a trooper?
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: Are you familiar with the tactical systems of an Imperial Class 2?
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Yes before I was a bridge officer, And yes I am familiar with the systems.&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: Want to try your hand at some test firing?
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava Smiles. &quot;You wish to see first hand my skills. Everything on this ship is a test I see.&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: You are our gunnery chief, show us what you can do&#8230;we could learn something.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Very well set up the test.&quot; **
The Lieutenant sets up the turbolasers for test fire mode&#8230;actual shots are not fired&#8230;but simulated targets appear for you to target and shoot at. **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: They will be simulated starfighters&#8230;
.
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: Go ahead Lieutenant.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue sighs and motions a male staff member to her &quot;help him dress.&quot; she asks, taking a curtain to give them privacy. **
(48074) Lieutenant: Yes Ma&#39;am.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava moves to the gunnery station and takes over the controls. **
After a few moments Vorhees is dressed.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue nods to the change in clothes and motions to a trooper &quot;mind carrying him so we can get to our meeting trooper?&quot; she requests, moving to stand beside the beside. **
(48074) Tk 212 : Have to check with the Commander
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to Rue and raises an eyebrow &quot;You still think I need to be carried??&quot; **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: Hmph&#8230;
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue raises a brow to the helmsman &quot;you think you can actually walk?&quot; she returns her attention to the trooper &quot;he&#39;ll be at the meeting as well. I do not want to be late, and you do not want to make me late. pick him up. so we can go.&quot; **
The tactical crew did not seem impressed at all.
** (48079) Commander Oturis stands up from his chair, and begins to leisurly stroll to the conference room timing it so that he will arrive several minutes before it starts **
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: Looks like you could use some work Lieutenant.
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: I can nurse maid you up to speed though. Give me about a week.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees sighs but resigns himself to the arms of a trooper. **
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Maybe some rest is all I need. Been ran through the ringer as it were.&quot; **
You all are aware the meeting is taking place in 15 minutes&#8230;time to start moving to the briefing room behind the bridge.
(48074) Lieutenant Darkqus: But in the meantime, you just tell us when to shoot.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava looking over to the Lt. &quot;If you will excuse me I have a meeting to attend.&quot; With that Kava exits the bridge and heads for the conference room. **
15 minutes pass, and you all arrive to the briefing room, with stormtroopers in tow.
** (48075) Lieutenant Rue takes her seat, watching the troopers a moment before giving them a shooing motion to leave. **
** (48079) Commander Oturis walks to his old seat, then remembers he is the acting captain and takes that position at the table **
You all take your seats in the ceremonial chamber at a large polished rectangular table. A HoloNet transceiver set in the middle of the console. The view port was to the right, allowing a beautiful view of Coruscant. The tension of the room could be cut with a vibro knife however as you prepared to hail Fleet Admiral Orcin.
** (48095) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Sergeant. Station two guards at the door and rest of you wait for orders.&quot; **
(48074) TK 212 : Roger Sir.
As you all sit&#8230;the Holodisplay of Fleet Admiral Orcin comes up.
** (48076) Lieutenant Vorhees doesnt even look at the commander. He had no respect for this idiot, in his opinion, and sat next to Rue. Hopefully, he could request that the comander be removed. **
(48074) Fleet Admiral Orcin: I&#39;ve already heard a lot about this fiasco on Coruscant. You all better have good explanations for this mess.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">SESSION 8 The Dark Informant and a Mysterious Relic
A few moments ago, the Star Destroyer Subjugator had experienced a very strange anomaly.
Lieutenant Rose had plugged in a strange pyramid shaped relic into the compuscan of the science labs.
The relic had caused a power surge and failure throughout the Subjugator. Fortunately, they were able to regain control of the ship.
The investigation of the strange relic was not without sacrifice, as Ensign Tamiel was vaporized in the process.
The crew stood in the science labs as the smoke was clearing and the red emergency lights lit up within the darkened room.
(52504) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant, what was the cause of this?
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Commander&#8230;The power surge began as soon as I tried to scan this strange relic recovered from the wreckage of the ship.
(52504) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant Kava, I want a damage report&#8230;have your men check for anymore casualties.
The Commander seemed slightly annoyed at the situation&#8230;
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava Aye,Sir.&quot; **
It was as if the recent events and the crews actions had been getting to him.
(52504) Commander Oturis: One more thing Kava.
(52504) Commander Oturis: You have the Deck&#8230;
(52504) Commander Oturis: I&#39;ll be in my quarters&#8230;.call me when you want your promotions.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava motions for the security troopers to begin their work. **
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Aye Sir.&quot; **
(52504) Commander Oturis: Otherwise cease any research on that device for the time being.
(52504) Commander Oturis: But look over the rest of the wreckage.
(52504) Commander Oturis: Use manual non-invasive scanning techniques on that device.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Understood Sir.&quot; **
I&#39;ll retire now&#8230;summon me for promotions soon.
The distraught commander left the room in a hurry, looking at the pile of dust that ensign tamiel left behind.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Not even his holotag survived.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Zadane. You heard the Commander, let&#39;s set the damnable pyramid aside for now and see if there is anything else of use that we can find in the wreckage&#8230;
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Look at him&#8230;he&#39;s wasted.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava looking over at Lt. Rose. &quot;Carry on; let me know if you find anything.&quot; **
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Aye, Lt. Kava.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava with that Kava goes about carrying out his orders. **
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava picking up his comm link. &quot;All stations report in. I want a damage report asap.&quot; **
(52504) TK-212: We will do that sir!
The stormtroopers move out in a hurry.
Some reports start filtering in to the acting XO.
Apparently, no casualties had been taken.
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose begins slowly, methodically searching through the wreckage of the ship, joined now by the after-effects of the catastrophe in the labs, looking for anything else from the assassin&#39;s ship that may provide a clue to their situation. **
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: You sure you want to bother with this pile of junk?
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: After what it did to Tamiel?
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lieutenant, Tamiel died in the service of the Empire &ndash; there&#39;s no reason to get sentimental. And if we don&#39;t want to join him today, we need to understand what&#39;s going on&#8230;
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Yes&#8230;
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: exactly….
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: What was I thinking&#8230;
The officer stood and straightened out his imperial tunic.
His regal posture immediately snapped back into place.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Should we remove the device?
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava after all stations reported in everything was in working order. Only the shields seemed worse for wear. Kava uses his data pad to relay the reports to the Commander. **
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Let&#39;s set it aside for now. We&#39;ll need to examine it further, I fear. But we must find a way to do so that doesn&#39;t put the ship at risk.
The commander didn&#39;t seem to really care about the report at the moment, which was strange.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: So remove it? You want to get engineers?
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: There is a possibility for damage&#8230;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Knowledge (Technology): [1d20+7+0] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [10,7,0] = (17)
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava using his comm link again. &quot;Lt. Rose I will be on the Bridge. If you find anything report to me there. Kava out.&quot; **
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava heads for the bridge. **
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Zadane, perhaps if we used a sensor pack we could find out more about this device without putting the ship&#39;s systems at risk again.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Sounds good.
The Lieutenant motioned for a sensor pack and an ensign brought it to him.
The Lieutenant did a slow sweep of the device&#8230;
The energy source was not like anything he had ever seen.
It was unknown, extreme caution was needed&#8230;
As Kava arrived on the bridge, the deck crew were doing rapid assessments of the ship damage.
(52504) Lieutenant Horcia: What was that all about Lieutenant?
About ten minutes pass….
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Something to do with that Sarin&#39;s ship that we brought on broad. Alert med bay that they will need to remove Ensign Tamiel&#39;s remains for the Lab.&quot;
(52504) Lieutenant Horcia: Yes sir, notifications will be made at once.
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose does another slow pass with the sensor pack, looking for signs in its construction that might give some clue to the device&#39;s planet or culture of origin&#8230; **
Rose is unable to do that with this device
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: I think we should leave it be.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Maybe try another Compscan&#8230;.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: It appears to still be plugged into the system.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: However it may be risky.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava looks around at the bridge staff. &quot;I want the shields back to full strength. Check the Computer Core over top to bottom. I want to make sure that there is nothing wrong.&quot; **
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: I don&#39;t want to put the ship&#39;s systems at risk again. Lt. Zadane, do you think we might be able to do a compscan using one of the astromech droids? That would keep it isolated&#8230;
(52504) Lieutenant Horcia: Systems crew, you heard the man. Shields back to full!
The Systems operations went to work on their corresponding work stations.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: That sounds ideal.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Ensigns, attend to that order.
Lieutenant Kava has been noticing that Commander Oturis has been acting very strange&#8230;
(52504) Systems Operator Elkin: Sir, we have a vessel uncloaking on the forward bow!
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava makes note of the Commanders actions as of late. It was not in Kava&#39;s nature to use under handed tactics unless necessary, but forewarned was fore armed. **
(52504) Comm Officer Orroran: Sir, we are being hailed!
The bridge crew was instantaneously more alert.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Stations! Identify that ship at once!&quot; **
(52504) Systems Operator Elkin: Yes sir!
(52504) Systems Operator Elkin: Starfighter, TIE fighter class sir&#8230;
(52504) Systems Operator Elkin: It&#39;s an oppressor model, but it’s not friendly!
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Gunner station! Target the fighter but do not fire until fired upon. I want Comms with that ship now!&quot;
(52504) Systems Operator Elkin: Wait one second!
(52504) Systems Operator Elkin: The Cloaking device was interfering with our sensors&#8230;
(52504) Systems Operator Elkin: It&#39;s friendly sir! Although it looks like an older craft.
The gunners look toward Lieutenant Kava
(52504) Comm Officer Ororan: Sir, I remind you&#8230;we are being hailed.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava &quot;Has it tried contacting us?&quot; **
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Let me hear it.&quot;
(52504) Comm Officer Ororan: Channel open sir.
The TIE and the Subjugator can now communicate.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Tie fighter state your intentions.&quot;
The ship was on yellow alert&#8230;but the Commander was not coming to the bridge.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: We&#39;re on Yellow Alert&#8230;
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: We need to go to stations Rose.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Ensigns watch the device&#8230;and don&#39;t touch it.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Ensign, please contact me when the astromech droid has arrived, in the meantime we&#39;ll be on the bridge.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Dont worry, my intentions are friendly&#8230;who might I be talking to?&quot;
The ensign nods in acknowledgement
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose turns and leaves the labs with a twinge of uncertainty and heads for the bridge. **
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Better yet, I&#39;ll stay with them. Take care of it LT.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: I&#39;ll handle things down here.
The comm officer turned to Lieutenant Kava&#8230;awaiting his response..the bridge was in silence&#8230;other than the beeping and whirring of the bridge systems.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &#39;This is Lt. Kava of the Subjugator, and you are?&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Who I am not very important at the moment, lieutenant&#8230;however, there is something aboard your ship that is…&quot;
Lieutenant Rose arrives at the Systems Operation consoles on the bridge.
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose arrives on the bridge and quickly assesses the situation, seeing the TIE through the forward portal. Staying silent, he takes a seat at his station. **
The IFF information appears in front of Rose.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;I am not aware of what you speak. Identify yourself or I will be forced to take action against you.&quot;
Apparently, the shields of the TIE were up&#8230;.Rose might want to communicate this to the acting XO.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Kava, the TIE has his shields up. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re dealing with a friendly here.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *What I speak of&#8230;lieutenant, is something that people like you should not be handling&#8230;it could be dangerous…
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Again I do not know of what you speak. My gunners have you targeted and will fire if ordered or you attack this ship. Identify yourself. Last Warning.&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *The comm remains silent for a moment, before the voice reappears*
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava to the bridge crew. &quot;Get the pilots to there fighters. Ready for launch.&quot; **
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose examines his station, trying to determine the weapons status of the mysterious fighter. **
(52504) Lieutenant Horcia: Yes sir! Lieutenant Vash&#8230;get the crews to their fighters&#8230;standby for launch.
The weapons systems on the TIE fighter were powered down.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: Are you certain of that, lieutenant? it would seems to me like you are a bit outnumbered..
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Kava, the fighter’s weapon systems appear to be powered down&#8230;for now.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Thank you Lt. Rose. Gunners if that fighter so much as flinches remove it from the sky.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Kava &ndash; I think he wants the device in our labs. If that&#39;s true, he may know something about it, as well as our mysterious assassin.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;You will remain quite about that Lt. Rose is that understood?&quot;
A tremendous battle cruiser decloaked in the viewport of the Subjugator!
(52504) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir, a battleship!
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose scans his console for information about the battlecruiser. **
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;SHIELDS! Red Alert! Launch fighters! Gunners target that Battleship!&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Use Computer: [1d20+17+0] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [17,17,0] = (34)
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Lieutenant, if you please&#8230;there is no need for hostilities&quot;
There were no readings on the battle station.
(52504) Lieutenant Horcia: TIE Fighters deploying sir!
(52504) Lieutenant Horcia: 50 craft off the deck!
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Very good. Have them from a defensive screen and hold.&quot;
** (52504) Hawkeye Radio Transmission *** This is Omega Squadron, Awaiting Orders Subjugator*** **
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Omega Squadron Hold and await attack orders.&quot;
** (52504) Hawkeye Radion Transmission ***Roger Defensive Screen&#8230;holding for your command Subjugator*** **
Everyone heard the inspiring and awesome sound of the Ion engines roaring past the viewport.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Lt.Hawkeye. Take two of your craft and secure that fighter. If it attacks remove it from the field.&quot;
** (52504) Hawkeye Radio Transmission **Roger that Subjugator, securing fighter** **
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava back to the enemy fighter. &quot;Identify yourself now or you will be fired upon.&quot; **
20 or so TIE&#39;s maneuvered in an orbiting pattern around Wylt&#39;s TIE fighter.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;You really need to learn the finer arts of diplomacy, you know that?&quot;
(52504) Comm Officer Orroran: Sir…
(52504) Comm Officer Orroran: We are receiving a hail from Coruscant Patrol Craft Tyridium.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Here I am, offering to help with a Force you cannot possibly control on your own, and this is your response?&quot;
(52504) Comm Officer Orroran: They are requesting immediate response.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;I prefer action most of the time sir. If you identify yourself and your intention we can talk on more friendly terms.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Use Computer: [1d20+17+0] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [11,17,0] = (28)
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Very well then&#8230;my name is Arkas Wylt, not that it will likely tell you anything&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Tell the patrol craft we have thing well in hand.&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;See was that so hard? What is your intentions?&quot;
Rose identifies the craft as a Mon Calamari MC80 Cruiser, its shields were down and so were its weapons&#8230;it was at medium range to the Subjugator.
Its IFF reads Coruscant Planentary Defense Force&#8230;so it was military.
(52504) Comm Officer Orroran: Yes, sir&#8230;relaying message.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Now now, haven&#39;t you been listening? I have come, because I know you have something onboard, that you are not really fit to handle&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;I am sure you know what I speak of&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;I have been listening. Before I allow you on board I need to be sure if you are a threat or not.&quot;
(52504) Comm Officer Orroran: Sir, Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan of the Tyridium demands a Situation report.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;You can understand that can&#39;t you?&quot;
Kava could use help, but the commander was still nowhere to be seen.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Orroran, put the Tyridium through to my comlink. I’ll speak to him while the Lt. talks to our&#8230;friend in the TIE fighter.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Tell him we have the stituation in hand and I will deal with him later.&quot;
(52504) Comm Officer Orroran: Roger&#8230;patching them through to your station Rose.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Of course, but how much of a threat can a single, outdated fighter be to your grand vessel?&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Tyridium, this is Lt. Rose on the Subjugator
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot; I am willing to let you come on broad if you follow my instructions to the letter is that understood?&quot;
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: Yes, what is your situation?
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: Your shields and weapons are up in Coruscant space.
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: Pick your actions carefully.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Captain, we have been confronted by a TIE fighter whose intentions toward our vessel are not entirely clear. We are merely taking appropriate precautions.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Also tell your friends to back away unless they want a fight.&quot;
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: He&#39;s identified as Imperial.
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: He&#39;s one of yours!
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, lieutenant, what friends are you referring to?&quot;
The battle cruiser disappeared from the viewport.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;The Battle ship right in front of&#8230;&#8230;&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Where did it go?&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Understood Captain. The fighter is Imperial. As for the pilot, well our XO has judged that due caution is appropriate.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Scan the area.&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Is something wrong lieutenant?&quot;
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: Ok, can you move this out of Coruscant space?
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Lt. Hawkeye escort that ship to the docking bay.&quot;
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: Lower your shields and weapons as soon as possible&#8230;please.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Kava &ndash; Coruscant is requesting that we move the Subjugator out of their space&#8230;
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: You&#39;re alerting us within Coruscant space&#8230;please understand.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Recall the fighters. Lower the shields and take us back to condition green.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Captain, we are lowering shields and returning to condition green. Will there be anything else?
The TIE fighters surround the unknown TIE and assume escort formation.
(52504) Captain Danrik Yi&#39;lan: Please move out of Coruscant space for the time being.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Security to hanger bay. I want that pilot secured I will be there shortly.&quot;
** (52504) Hawkeye ***Radio Transmission*** Escorting target to hangar bay Subjugator. **
** (52504) Hawkeye Omega Squadron, watch him closely, keep weapons cool. **
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Fighter you will be escorted into the hanger bay and your ship secured there. You will hand over all weapons to security personel. Understood?&quot;
(52504) TK-212 : All security personnel to the main hangar bay!
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;I understand. See you soon lieutenant.&quot;
Stormtroopers began moving to the forward bay.
The helmsman began using sublight drive engines to steer away from Coruscant.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Kava, Coruscant security is requesting that we move out of their space. How do you wish me to respond?
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Captain, we are pulling out of Corsuscant space now.
The time is now 1222.
(52504) Captain Danrik: Thank you, follow your present course.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Understood Lt. Rose when the fighters are secure take us out of Corsuscant space.&quot;
(52504) Captain Danrik: We&#39;ll contact you later.
(52504) Captain Danrik: Tyridium out.
The fighters land within the massive forward hangar bay.
The medium gathering of Stormtroopers began securing the polished black flooring of the bay.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *inside his fighter, Arkas slowly powers it down and begins to release himself from the seat in order to exit the ship*
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Kava, shall I meet our guest in the hangar bay?
(52504) TK-205: Pilot, present yourself for searching and disarming.
The stormtrooper squad approached the lone man.
(52504) TK-205: Hands where we can see them.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;No we both will.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Aye.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *the man raises his hands above his head and smiles pleasantly* &quot;Whatever you say soldier&quot;
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava heads for the main hanger. **
One stormtrooper, probably lower in rank, holsters his E-11 and approaches Wylt.
The other stormtroopers had their E-11&#39;s pointing to the ground.
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose follows Lt. Kava. As he does so, he uses his comlink to contact Lt. Zadane in the labs. &quot;Lt. Zadane please secure the labs, do not allow anyone entrance unless authorized by myself or Lt. Kava.&quot; **
The stormtrooper searchers Wylt.
(52504) TK-205: [1d20+8] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [11,8] = (19)
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane : Roger, the astromech has nothing to report.
The stormtrooper looks cautiously at the weapon on his belt.
(52504) TK-205: What is that?
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava as he and Lt. Rose head to the main hanger. &quot;Blast! Where is the Commander? He should be handling this. It is his job.&quot; **
You could comm him Kava.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Yes, the Commander&#39;s behavior does seem to be erratic at best, as of late.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Oh that? It&#39;s nothing, just a data rod&quot;
The Sergeant of the Stormtroopers talks to the private.
Asking him to remove the item&#8230;carefully.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava grabing his comm link. &quot;Commander we have a situation in the main hanger bay. I believe your presence is required.&quot; **
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *loosening the object from his belt, Arkas hands it to the soldier*
** (52504) Commander Oturis *Slurred speech* Take care of it&#8230;just call me when it&#39;s time for promotions. **
The stormtrooper took the item.
(52504) TK-205: He also has credits on him.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Now, since you took something from me, I think it would only be fair that you give me your weapon.&quot;
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava looks at Lt.Rose as he hears the Commanders voice. &quot;Understood Sir.&quot; **
(52521) Arkas Wylt: Use the Force: [1d20+21+0] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [15,21,0] = (36)
The E-11 is ripped from TK-205&#39;s hand&#8230;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot; The Commander is either drunk or something. The man is undisciplined and unfit for command.&quot;
(52504) TK-205: Sergeant&#8230;
(52504) TK-205: I&#39;ll give the man my blaster.
The stormtrooper hands the E-11 to Wylt.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Thank you soldier&quot;
The Sergeant yelled at his lackey
(52504) TK-205: What the firkat?
(52504) TK-217 : Trooper, you are out line!
(52504) TK-217 : Great, he&#39;s armed now!
(52504) TK-217 : Drop the weapon!
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose listens to Kava, concerned. After a moment he thumbs his comlink, contacting the Medical Bay. &quot;Lt. Rue, would you please pay a visit to our Commander? Lt. Kava and I are quite concerned about his condition.&quot; **
(52504) Lieutenant Rue: Yes Lieutenant, I&#39;m on it.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *Arkas spreads his hands, innocently* &quot;But sir, it was a gift&quot;
(52504) TK-217: Lieutenant Kava, situation is deteriorating down here.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: If we&#39;re going to have to tell the Admiral what&#39;s going on, we&#39;d better have a doctor&#39;s report to back us up.
(52504) TK-217: Silence, drop the weapon!
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Trooper if he pulls anything you have orders to shoot. I will not have this on my watch is that understood!?!&quot;
(52504) TK-217: Yes Lieutenant!
(52504) TK-217: Drop the weapon or I will fire upon you!
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Sounds like we better hurry!
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Yes it does.&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Now, can&#39;t we reach some sort of agreement here? I&#39;ll trade you the weapon for my data rod&quot;
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava hurries to the main hanger bay. **
You two arrive on scene via turbolift.
(52504) TK-217: Do it private!
(52504) TK-217: We&#39;ve got you covered.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava walks over to the troopers and the pilot. &quot;Hold Sergeant!&quot; **
** (52504) TK-203 approaches Wylt, after taking the E-11. **
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Keep weapons on him.&quot;
The Sergeant barks the order to hold.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lt. Rose stands back, observing the situation, while Kava takes command of the troopers.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *Smiling, Arkas turns to the newcomer* Well, that voice I recognize&#8230;lieutenant Kava, was it?
(52504) Lieutenant Rue: Lieutenant Rose&#8230;he&#39;s drinking Corellian Whiskey.
(52504) Lieutenant Rue: He&#39;s a mess, drinking on the job&#8230;passing out at his desk.
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava looking at Wylt. &quot;You where instructed on how you where to conduct yourself on this ship. Where you not?&quot; **
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Lieutenant Rue, thank you. Perhaps it&#39;s best that you sedate him. we&#39;ve got issues in the hangar bay that wouldn&#39;t be helped any by Ortuis showing up drunk.
(52504) Lieutenant Rue: Roger that, his actions will be documented.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Thank you, Lt. Rue. Rose out.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Yes, sir&quot;
The TIE pilots were still landing in the disance in front of the group.
The ION engines made it quite annoying to hear.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;This weapon, however, isn&#39;t mine. It was given to me by this nice soldier here&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Then please explain to me why I should not toss you out the nearest airlock?&quot;
** (52504) Lieutenant Zadane **Comlink** Lieutenant, we lost the astromech. **
That was to Rose.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Zadane - what do you mean, lost it?
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;And you will give the Trooper back his weapon.&quot;
** (52504) Lieutenant Zadane *Com* He was friend after computer porting. **
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;As you wish&quot; *Arkas hands the weapon back to the trooper* &quot;Now, perhaps I can have my confiscated item back then?&quot;
** (52504) Lieutenant Zadane *Comm* Trying to get a better readout on the device. **
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava smiles. &quot;When I get that trust from you, you will have it back.&quot; **
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: *Comm* Zadane &ndash; Understood. Perhaps it&#39;s best to leave the device alone for now. As soon as I can I&#39;ll return to the lab and we can determine our next step.
(52504) Lieutenant Zadane: Roger, Zadane out.
The TIE Pilots went about their business moving to and from in the hangar bay.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;I have no wish to offend you sir, but I am afraid I have to insist. But really, you can trust me. Soldier, please hand me my item&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: Use the Force: [1d20+21+0] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [2,21,0] = (23)
(52504) Stormtrooper: I will hand you your item.
The stormtrooper hands over the &quot;data rod&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Thank you soldier, you are most kind&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Knowledge (Technology): [1d20+7+0] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [9,7,0] = (16)
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: [1d20+5] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [14,5] = (19)
The stormtroopers watched the scene&#8230;they were certainly not in control.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;So, are we going to be standing here all day, or perhaps we could go someplace more pleasant?&quot;
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava Looking at Wlyt. &quot;Go keep your whatever. Understand if I am going to traust you, you will have to earn that trust.&quot; **
The hangar bay was quite loud&#8230;with the engine cooldown and the deck officer speaking over the PA.
** (52504) Lieutenant Rue *Com* He&#39;s sedated in the medbay&#8230;. **
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Shall we take this to the conference room?&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;By all means, please do. I think we have things to discuss&quot;
(52504) Lieutenant Rue: I shall mark this in his DD-212 form Lieutenant Rose&#8230;this is inexcusable.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Troopers, please escort our guest to the conference room. If he stumbles, shoot him.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Very well. Lt.Rose, Sergeant. This way.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: *com* Thank you, Lt. Rue.
(52504) Lieutenant Rue: Out.
The stormtroopers assume escort formation and proceed to the conference room, just a couple levels below the bridge.
You arrive after a few minutes.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *Arkas follows quietly along, and takes a seat in the conference room, waiting for his hosts to get settled*
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava once in the conference room. &quot;So what is so important that you had to risk getting vaped to tell us?&quot; **
The elegantly decorated briefing room boasted a view port &#8230;you could see Coruscant becoming more distant by the second. You could see the bristle from the distant patrol craft.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Like I said, it is nothing that I have to tell you&#8230;but rather something you have here on your ship. An item most likely, but perhaps you have picked up some strange folks lately&quot;
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose stands with his back against the door, letting the Lt. Gava handle the interrogation **
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;We may have. You understand that I cannot tell you what you without orders from my superiors.&quot;
An attractive female human with brown short hair walks into the briefing room.
(52504) Ensign Kayl&#39;la : Sir, it&#39;s lunch time. Have you all eaten?
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Thank you Ensign. Some food and caf will do.&quot;
(52504) Ensign Kayl&#39;la : Right away sir.
** (52504) Comm Officer Ororan *Com** Lieutenant Kava Sir; receiving a hail from Fleet Admiral Orcin of Onslaught. **
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Well then, perhaps you&#39;d better contact them. This is something that you would want to get unde control sooner rather than later&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;If you can help us as you say then I will contact my supiors and see what they want me to do. Is that satisfactory?&quot;
(52504) Comm Officer Ororan : *Com* Shall I patch him through to the conference room?
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;That will do, yes&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Great. How the blazes did he find out so fast. Put him through to the conference room.&quot;
The older human in White dress appeared upon the HoloNet transceiver on the conference room table. His grizzled gray beared was being stroked as he assumted a rigid stance.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin : Officers, attention!!
!
** (52527) Lieutenant Kava snaps to attention. **
** (52506) Lieutenant Rose already standing, snaps to attention. **
(52521) Arkas Wylt: *Arkas remains sitting*
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Who in the forsaken mines of Kessel is that?
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Sir, He is Arkas Wylt. He cliams he has information for us.&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;My apologies, Admiral, but you called officers to attention, and it seemed polite to follow your orders&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Outstanding&#8230;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Take your seats.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: I have to say&#8230;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: This new crew of the Subjugator is having a hell of a first week.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;Kava motions for the troopers to exit the room and stand guard outside.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: The information from Coruscant and the destroyed craft by your Commander has made waves in the Moff High Council.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Now I&#39;m not hearing the end of it.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Either you all are doing something really right&#8230;or really bad.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;I am sorry sir. We shall try not to bring you further problems.&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Do not try Lieutenant.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Execute.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Now&#8230;who is this informat?
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Aye, Aye Sir.&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;He is&#8230; Maybe it would be better if he explains that.&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: I&#39;m listening.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Believe me, you have my *undivided* attention.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Well, as the lieutenant already said, my name is Arkas Wylt&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Names names names&#8230;I don&#39;t have time for them.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;And I have contacted your crew because it came to my attention that they might have uncovered a potentially dangerous power&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Power?
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Wait a minute.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Where the hell is your commander?!
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Get him in here&#8230;ASAP.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;He is indisposed sir.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Admiral, the Commander is under sedation in the medical bay.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Why?
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Yes, a power which nature is unfortunately unknown to me, but I suspect it to be an item, or possibly an individual&quot;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Yes. He was found drunk in his quarters.&quot;
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Your officers have been reluctant to share that information with me.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: He was examined by our medical officer, who found him unfit for duty today &ndash; intoxicated.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Great, a drunk acting captain&#8230;and an informant who could be harbinger to disaster.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: or just a lunatic who was allowed on board.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;I have command of the ship until otherwise ordered.&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: I&#39;ll handle the Commander personally.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: But you&#8230;informant&#8230;continue.
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Well, as I said, the nature of the power on board this vessel eludes me, but I happen to know that if treated wrongly, consequences can be quite spectacular&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Well then&#8230;Lieutenant Kava&#8230;Rose&#8230;see to it that this power is treated right.
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;Aye, Sir.&quot;
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: Yes sir.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: And I want you two to give me more information on what the hell he is talking about&#8230;
(52527) Lieutenant Kava: &quot;It is secured in the main lab.&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Eh?
(52521) Arkas Wylt: &quot;With all due respect Admiral&#8230;I don&#39;t believe the Empire has had a commander capable of handling a similar power since <span style="color:#FF0000;">Lord Vader</span>.&quot;
The Fleet Admiral looked at Wylt with awe.
(52506) Lieutenant Rose: That traitor is no &quot;Lord.&quot;
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Ok&#8230;.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: Someone wake the commander&#39;s ass up.
(52504) Fleet Admiral Orcin: We have a lot to talk about.

### **Dreamwalker** (2011-01-19 15:01:24)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">SESSION 9: A New Mission</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The massive formation of the Subjugator&#39;s personnel remained in rigid postures in the colossal polished hangar bay.
Most everyone was in attendance to see Lieutenant Kava receive the rank of Lieutenant Commander.
The TIE fighters continued to buzz outside of the energy shield that led into open space.
Definitely an awe inspiring sight, as it was contrasted by the men and women of the Remnant.
With a loud resolving voice, Commander issued the order to prepare for hyperspace travel to the Bastion system.
Though you weren&#39;t sure the purpose, everyone began snapping to as they moved back to their duties with urgency.
Lieutenant Rose and Lieutenant Rue stood upright, amongst the dispersing crowd. They were sure to follow up on this situation as senior officers.
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose took the order as his cue to head to the bridge. As he walked his mind was still turning over the events with the intruder. He was certain that the beast was dangerous, and worried that the rest of the crew were taking the threat he represented too lightly. **
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue waited a short time for some of the other crew to disperse a bit more, deciding on where best to go, her med bay was in working order to her liking now..&quot;why Bastian?&quot; she asks of the commander as she makes her way to him, hands held behind her back. **
** (61180) Commander Oturis looks at the lieutenant when she addresses him **
(61180) Commander Oturis: I don’t know, I wasn’t informed of the reason, just that we should make haste.
(61117) Lieutenant Rue: Not even a theory&#8230;hm.
(61180) Commander Oturis: I&#39;m sure we will find out soon enough Lieutenant; the way things have been going it will probably not be to our liking either.
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue crosses her arms &quot;I believe you and I need to have a talk about your&#8230;activites on duty.&quot; it was the best way to put drinking on the job in her mind, and she needed to know if this was going to be a problem; yes he&#39;d been able to perform so far, however that wasn&#39;t to say it wouldn&#39;t bite him in the ass later, and kill them all. **
** (61154) Lieutenant Horcia ***Comm*** Commander Oturis, shall I begin pre-hyperspace protocol? **
(61180) Commander Oturis: Yes, begin them I&#39;ll be there shortly, but contact engineering and make sure they&#39;ve got the engines working correctly before we make the jump.
** (61154) Lieutenant Horcia ***Comm*** Yes sir! **
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose , arriving at the bridge headed for his station. The order to head to Bastion seemingly came out of nowhere so Rose intended to familiarize himself with the current intelligence on the system. Hopefully the purpose of their voyage might become apparent. **
(
** (61180) Commander Oturis grits his teeth &quot; What I do with my free time is none of your concern Lieutenant Rue, unless it affects my job performance. If you&#39;ll excuse me I have a ship to run.&quot; turning away he begins overseeing the preparations for the jump to hyperspace **
The bridge did not seem to know the purpose of the course either, as they routinely were making hyperspace checks.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Lieutenant Rose&#8230;
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Yes, Lt. Horcia?
(61180) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant Horcia, how are the preparations going?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Engineering reports the power fluctuations in one primary engine&#8230;
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue narrows her gaze after him, turning follow quickly and come into step beside him &quot;It&#39;s my job to ensure you continue to run this ship at your highest performance until a new captain is appointed. This is my job, if your recreational activites become a problem I will need to take action, now I&#39;m asking you again. Are we going to have a problem?&quot; **
(61215) Renevion (exit): 16:15
Rue stays closely behind Oturis, following him to the bridge.
** (61154) Lieutenant Horcia ***Comm*** Sir, primary engine one is fluctuating&#8230;will take 2-3 hours repair time. **
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: ***Comm*** If we&#39;re in a rush, we could leave now, but I would advise against that.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Fine, inform them to make the repairs, in the mean time we&#39;ll have to make a better hyperspace route to make up for lost time.
** (61154) Lieutenant Horcia ***Comm*** But engineering reports no safety hazard&#8230; **
(61180) Commander Oturis: I&quot;d rather take no chances than have a mishap while in hyperspace
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose , at his station begins pulling up data files on Bastion, looking for current information about planets in the system and best estimates of fleet presences. **
** (61154) Lieutenant Horcia ***Comm*** Yes sir, wise decison sir&#8230;it will be done. **
Bastion was the capital of Imperial territory
all local systems were friendly to the Empire, and some of the most powerful ships were patrolling the sector.
** (61180) Commander Oturis makes his way over to navigation **
The officers looked up to Oturis, all from their stations.
(
61180) Commander Oturis: I need you to plot me the fastest possible route to bastion, take your time and get it right, If we can I&#39;d like th break the speed record, but try to do it safely.
(61154) Lieutenant Kolvin: Yes sir&#8230;
(61154) Lieutenant Kolvin: Should be easy enough.
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue rolls her eyes, taking up a bit of space near the side, arms followed as she watched the commander; yes he was making good judgment calls, however was he under the influence or not was a question she wanted answered, and if he knew when enough was really enough **
Rue was following Oturis like a mynock to power cables.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Commander, does this order seem a little strange to you? It&#39;s a little difficult for me to imagine what purpose the Subjugator is suppose to serve at Bastion.
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan : Sir, our emissaries report further questioning. They are being asked to stay in Urbid City.
** (61180) Commander Oturis could feel the lieutenant following him and watching him, he knew her kind, no matter how many good decisions he made, she&#39;d pounce on any remotley bad call like a cat on a wounded mouse&#8230; **
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan : Your orders?
(61180) Commander Oturis: Contact the Coruscant authorities and ask if there are any formal charges being levied against my men, if not ask that they be released or they will be in violation of treaty section 192.38 stating that emmissaries may not be detained without charges for more than 12 hours.
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan : Yes sir&#8230;right away.
She begins relaying the message.
** (61180) Commander Oturis glances at Lieutenant Rose,&quot; Strange as it may be, we have our orders, I see no reason why we should go there. From what I understand theres a meeting, but I could easily attend via holonet transmission. **
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: My thoughts exactly. Our presence could easily be simulated. So one of the Moffs must wish access to either the Subjugator or something&#8230;or someone&#8230;we have on board.
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan : (100 XP rose))
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue frowns, so they&#39;re purpose for going was a meeting? listening to the pair she wondered if the Moffs wanted the &#39;guest&#39; on board, or even the artifacts recovered. **
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan : Sir, we&#39;re being hailed from Urbid City security department.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Put it through.
A holovid of a bothan comes up on screen, he was dressed in a dark blue uniform of some type, with medals and such.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Captain of the Subjugator&#8230;.
(61180) Commander Oturis: This is Commander Oturis, with whom am I speaking?
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Chief Vorsk Vey&#39;lin of Urbid City Security Department.
(61180) Commander Oturis: What can I do for you Chief Vey&#39;lin
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Commander, I&#39;d hate to inform you of this&#8230;
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: But we&#39;re going to have to hold onto your emissaries for an investigation.
You all hear the hail via a HoloNet transmission at the center of the bridge.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Isn’t that what you&#39;ve been doing with them?
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose turned to watch Oturis reaction to this turn of events. **
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Yes, but I&#39;m afraid we won&#39;t be able to release them until the investigation is complete.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Which could require a substantial amount of time.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Are charges being filed?
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Not at the moment&#8230;but they are under investigation for assault to Urbid City police by Remnant personnel.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: We have four eyewitnesses to the alledged assault by imperial personnel.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Four police officers to be exact.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: With various injuries&#8230;
(61180) Commander Oturis: Anything serious?
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: No, they all fine.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: But they insist uniformed imperials attacked them.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: We&#39;re going to need your full cooperation on this incident.
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue frowns faintly &quot;what kind of injuries were sustained?&quot; she asked, moving a bit closer for the commander to hear her **
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Minor lacerations, some bruises&#8230;.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Nothing to be alarmed of.
(61180) Commander Oturis: I&quot;ll cooperate within the confines of interspace law, which requires that if no charges are filed my men cannot be held, which constitutes unlawful imprisonment.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: However, the problem is the individuals they asked to cooperate with&#8230;resisted.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Ok then&#8230;.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: That is perfect.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: We will release your emissaries&#8230;.
(61180) Commander Oturis: May I also remind you that we are here on a diplomatic charter.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: But the evidence has been recorded.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Very well, I understand your sentiments but I cannot allow my men to be held without charge, I&#39;m sure you understand.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: I absolutely understand.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Why would uniformed imperials attack police officers on Coruscant? Must have been some retired veterans with post traumatic stress reliving the Galactic Civil War&#8230;or some military brats.
(
** (61180) Commander Oturis shrugs,who knows **
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: That&#39;s the problem&#8230;no one knows.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Anyways, the men will be released without further delay.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Very well, I will also inform you as I agreed to earlier that we will be leaving for bastion in the next several hours.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Very well. I wish you a good journey.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Always a pleasure to meet a Star Destroyer Captain.
(61154) Vorsk Vey&#39;lin: Vorsk Vey&#39;lin&#8230;out.
The comm officer turned from her station&#8230;eyeing the commander.
Lieutenant Horcia also looked quite confused.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir?
(61180) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Something we should know?
(61180) Commander Oturis: There was some confusion as to who the perpetrator who killed the captain was on the surface, we needed to make a hasty escape, unfortunately coruscant security tried to get in the way
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir, as First Officer of this ship&#8230;I request a word in private&#8230;along with the CMO.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Very well
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Lieutenant Rose, take the bridge please.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Aye.
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue glances over to the lieutenant and commander exchange, sighing she follows after the pair. **
Lieutenant Horcia leads the way back to the briefing room located on the bridge.
He quickly walks in and surveys the viewport, and spreads his arms down on the polished table and looked up at the Commander.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir&#8230;
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: It&#39;s not really my business.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Permission to speak freely?
(61180) Commander Oturis: granted
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: What the hell is going on here sir?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: I receive new orders that we&#39;re getting fresh officers to lead a ship.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: We go to a diplomatic mission, pick up a dangerous stranger&#8230;.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: and now you walk around smelling like a cantina.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: And now we&#39;re getting investigations from Coruscant authorities!
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue makes a note of raising a brow to the commander, as though to say told you or something like that. She moves to a seat, crossing her legs to simply let the lieutenant get it all out for now. **
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: We lost Captain Narweld&#8230;.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: and now this is your ship.
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose observes the crew on the bridge going about their work at their stations. He keeps thinking about the message from Coruscant. Frankley, it seems to Rose that any society that puts sniveling animals like Bothan&#39;s into positions of responsibility isn&#39;t long for this galaxy. **
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re doing a bad job&#8230;nor is it my job to criticize.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: But my seniority should be respected&#8230;
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: and I&#39;ve known the crew longer than you.
(61180) Commander Oturis: What are you getting at lieutenant?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: The men are getting confused&#8230;.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: and that will make them less efficient&#8230;
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Well I take that back&#8230;
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: It will make them less cooperative.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: and less trusting.
(61180) Commander Oturis: what are they getting confused about?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: The situation of this ship, and its commander.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Whom they barely know.
(61180) Commander Oturis: The situation is&#8230; complex&#8230;I get my orders from the admiral and the moffs, and sometimes, well alot of the time those orders are contradictory or obviously self serving
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: I understand this was some Moff&#39;s idea in a cushy office&#8230;
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Give some promising young officers a ship and see what they could do with it.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: But right now&#8230;things could be better.
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan: Lieutenant Rose, the emissaries are en route back to the ship.
(61117) Lieutenant Rue: Lieutenant, the commander didn&#39;t ask for this position. Do you find him incapable of his current job?
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Thank you Officer Ororan.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Could be a lot worse to Lieutenant, this will get better as the crew gets used to my leadership style.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: *comm* Commander Oturis?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: I think you should be asking yourself that question Lieutenant Rose.
(61180) Commander Oturis: *comm* yes?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: It&#39;s not my question to answer.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia:
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: *comm* Commander, just wanted to let you know, our emissaries en route to the Subjugator now.
(61117) Lieutenant Rue: You are bringing up the crews feelings of things and your own, the question stands to you. You&#39;re speaking freely, do you find him incapable. Do you find it difficult to follow your orders?
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: No ma&#39;am.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: It&#39;s just&#8230;.
(61117) Lieutenant Rue: yes?
Horcia turns to face the viewport&#8230;mumbling under his breath.
He turns back&#8230;
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Excuse this unnecessary inquiry Commander&#8230;.Chief&#8230;
he nods to both officers.
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: I shall return to my duties.
** (61180) Commander Oturis stops him from leaving **
He tugs at the bottom of his uniform, straightening it out.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Horcia I need you on this, I have a feeling the schedule around here is going to be hectic for the near future, and I&#39;m going to need you to help me keep the crew together.
The Liuetenant got quite a confused look on his face and leaned forward slightly..
(61154) Lieutenant Horcia: Sir&#8230;.Yes Sir&#8230;
(61180) Commander Oturis: Alright carry on..
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue hums faintly &quot;your concern is appreacted Lieutenant, do not be afraid to bring your concerns to attention.&quot; **
(61117) Lieutenant Rue: or to speak freely
The Lieutenant nods and promptly leaves the room.
The CMO and Commander exchanged looks.
** (61180) Commander Oturis looks at rue with a look of disdain and to returns to the bridge **
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue rolls her eyes &quot;jerk.&quot; she mutters and follows after him. **
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose watches Oturis and Rue return to the bridge, curious about the meeting that just took place. **
Horcia notably distanced himself from the new officers, supervising the pre-hyperspace procedures.
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue glances over to the first officer, she&#39;d have to make a point to speak with him again, without the commanding officer present. In the meantime, she returns to her position bat the side, surveying the commander. **
After a few moments, you confirm the emissaries back onboard.
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose breathes a sigh of relief. Having the emissaries safely back on board was one less source of tension on a ship that had more than it&#39;s share. **
** (61180) Commander Oturis walks back onto the bridge &quot; Lieutenant Rose, I&#39;ll take back over now **
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Yes sir.
Approximately 3 hours pass, the engineers report engines back to full strength.
The crew begins plotting a hyperspace course.
(
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue had left some hours ago for her med bay and office, going over supplies, projecting how many patients would be able to be treated before needing more, busy work that was mindless and not needed; as well as beginning a list of the commanders habits, better to know what days he was better with desicions and if he had been drinking that day. **
(61154) Navigator Ortell: Sir&#8230;.Hyperspace course plotted.
(61154) Navigator Ortell: Shall we release our waste from the ship?
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Commander, have you had any of the crew debrief the emissaries? I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t trust Bothans and would prefer to hear it from our own men that they were treated properly and only subjected to&#8230;*appropriate* lines of questioning.
(61180) Commander Oturis: No, just make the jump, I don’t want to leave anything for the republic to pick through.
(61154) Navigator Ortell: Yes Sir&#8230;
(61180) Commander Oturis: Go ahead and debrief them Rose, If you find anything I&#39;ll file a formal complaint.
(61154) Navigator Ortell: Prepare for the jump to hyperspace.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Yes, sir.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: *comm* Lt. Zadane?
** (61154) Lieutenant Zadane **Comm** Yes Lieutenant? **
The ship whirred loudly, resonating the sound of the hyperdrive powering up to full capacity.
In all viewports&#8230;the stars expanded to starlines. The planet of Coruscant vanished from view as you entered the brilliant blue luminescent wormhole of hyperspace.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: *comm* I&#39;m going to debrief the emmisaries that were being held on Coruscant. Would you join me in the briefing room off the bridge?
** (61154) Lieutenant Zadane **Comm** I must monitor the helm for now. **
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: *comm* Roger
(
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Ensign Torvik, would you please ask the emissaries to meet me in the Bridge briefing room?
(61154) Ensign Torvik: Yes Sir&#8230;
(61154) Ensign Torvik: Do you need the Commander as well?
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: No, ensign. I&#39;ll comm the commander if his presence is required.
The situation in the Med bay was quite grim, recently one of the ensigns had been reduced to a pile of ash.
The types that ran the bay were not quite cold as typical Imperial officers.
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose leaves the bridge for the briefing room to await the emissaries. **
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue stood from her desk and moved into the bay, watching her staff for a moment; death happened, and in their field they would see it often&#8230;maybe this was a good time to discuss things with her staff. **
Ensigns Torvik, Tavhek, and Lorus arrive.
(61154) Ensign Torvik: Sir, reporting as order.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Thank you ensign.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: First, gentlemen, let me express the regrets of the entire crew that you were forced to endure detainment by the Republic on the Coruscant. I can assure you that we did everything in our power to bring you home as quickly as was possible.
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan: Commander Oturis Sir!
(61180) Commander Oturis: yes?
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan: We&#39;re receiving a top priority hypercomm transmission from Moff Flennic.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: How were you treated during your detainment? Were you given the respect due you? You may speak freely.
(61180) Commander Oturis: I&#39;ll take it in my quarters
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan: Sir..
(61180) Commander Oturis: Horcia you have the con
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan: You&#39;ll need a skilled systems operator to receive this call.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Fine you come to
The lieutenant scoffed at the Commander&#39;s unfamiliarity of hypercomm signals.
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan: I cannot do sir&#8230;it must be a systems operator.
(61154) Comm Officer Ororan: Not alone anyways.
(61180) Commander Oturis: ok then, well who can then
** (61154) Comm Officer Ororan ***Comm*** Lieutenant Rose, you&#39;re needed at the bridge&#8230;top priority. **
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue clears her throat to gain the attention of her staff &quot;I believe&#8230;we have neglected to take a time from our duties to discuss what has happened to one of our own.&quot; she clears her throat again and sighs &quot;As imperial officers we are trained to act a certain way, however as medical staff it is our job to care for outpatients and eachother&#8230;this could be a good time to speak of who we lost, and how it is effecting each of us in turn.&quot; **
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: *comm* Roger that.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Well, ensigns, I&#39;m afraid to say that we must continue this debriefing at another time. Sorry to interrupt your duties.
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose leaves the briefing room, returning to the bridge. **
(61154) Ensign Lorus: Shall we remain here sir?
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: no Ensign, this may take a while. I&#39;ll make arrangements to take your statements at another time.
The med bay seemed unaffected by Rue&#39;s insincere tone, or perhaps she just didn&#39;t know how to word things.
The med crew gave an unanimous, but uninspired&#8230;&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am&quot;
Rose arrives to the Systems operation panel on the bridge.
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose looked around the bridge as he returned&#8230;&quot;Commander&#8230;I believe you requested my presence?&quot; **
Zadane was hard at work.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Seems your the only one around here that can put through hyperspace tranmissions
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Yes sir.
** (61178) Lieutenant Rose returned to his station and prepared to put the transmission through. **
(61154) Lieutenant Zadane: I got a fix on the signal, now just transfer to the signal to our receivers.
(61154) Lieutenant Zadane: You ready?
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Ready.
** (61117) Lieutenant Rue rubbed her face, she was not good at this sort of thing, damn her upbringing. &quot;Look, the atmosphere in this room is not up to the standards I have of all nor of what you should have for yourself. We lost one of our own, yes, that&#39;s true; however we see death as part of our job; it hurts when it&#39;s one that&#39;s known or part of the team, but life moves forward and so should we. Our fallen will not be forgotten but we will not allow the pain and memory of death &#39;cause our skills and attitudes to slip. The memory deserves better than that. If anyone needs time to gather themselves, do it.&quot; **
(61154) Lieutenant Zadane: Signal received&#8230;transferring communication to the Commander&#39;s quarters.
(61154) Lieutenant Zadane: Nice work Lieutenant.
(61154) Lieutenant Zadane: I couldn&#39;t tell you are new.
The crew seemed quite impressed at Rose&#39;s effiency at the Systems Station.
(61178) Lieutenant Rose: Thank you, Lieutenant.
(61180) Commander Oturis: Alright i&#39;ll be back shortly, Horcia you have the con
(61154) Liuetenant Horcia: Yes sir&#8230;&#8230;
** (61180) Commander Oturis makes his way to his quarters and watches the transmission **
Moff Kurlen Flennic appeared on in HoloNet form.
(61154) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Commander
(61154) Moff Kurlen Flennic: You&#39;ve received new orders.
(61154) Moff Kurlen Flennic: We&#39;ve received word from another powerful contact.
(61154) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Set your course for the Shili System&#8230;and standby for orders.
(61154) Moff Kurlen Flennic: I would advise extreme caution&#8230;.</span>

## Re: Play Session Logs 6-?

### **Dreamwalker** (2011-01-21 16:25:14)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The New Destination</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Commander Oturis had just received a top priority hypercomm message in the briefing room.
Ltc Kava and Lieutenant Vorhees had heard the transmission had come from Moff Flennic, one of the top Moffs in the Empire.
They couldn&#39;t help but be intrigued as they walked about the bridge&#8230;monitoring the Subjugator in hyperspace.
The First Officer, Lieutenant Horcia, seemed particularly distraught as he rubbed his rough shaven beard that was growing in from working late.
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : Lieutenant Vorhees, are we on course?
The first officer noticed Kava on the bridge.
He rendered a salute to the Lieutenant Commander.
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : I suppose you&#39;re taking the bridge Lieutenant Commander sir?
** (62699) Lieutenant Rue watched over her staff, she wasn&#39;t good with people apparently&#8230;a lot more than she thought. It rendered a sigh from her lips, what was she supposed to do? **
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava salutes Lt. Horcia back. &quot;Yes. What is our status?&quot; **
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : Waiting for our helmsman report on our course to Bastion Sir.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees looks up and answers the other Liuetennant &quot;Yes, it appears that we are. Let me double check to make sure there are no deviations.&quot; **
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well.&quot;
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : The Commander is receiving a top priority hypercomm transmission&#8230;
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes, he will be awhile at that.&quot;
The Med Bay seemed to go about their routine, checking medical supplies and writing reports on the deceased ensign.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees works at the controls a bit to try and correct something. &quot;Drifting&#8230;could delay us a bit but working on a solution. Shouldnt be a problem.&quot; **
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : Drift?
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : Say again Lieutenant?
(62708) Lieutenant Vorhees: Minor fluctuation in Engine number 1. Nothing too major but it could delay us.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I trust Lt. Vorhess you have the situation in hand?&quot;
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : Lt. Commander that should of been fixed&#8230;
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees looks to the newly promoted Lt Commander and nods. &quot;I just now noticed it and I am in the process of correcting it, Sir.&quot; **
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Contact enginering and see if they can correct it.&quot;
** (62699) Lieutenant Rue turns back to her desk, her staff didn&#39;t know her well yet and she had rather made some bad impressions in sincenerity..she decided to see of making a speech for the ensign, maybe she could say nice things&#8230;it would be her job wouldn&#39;t? **
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia : In mid course that might be a bad idea sir&#8230;
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees blinks and asks puzzled &quot;So&#8230;should we stop the ship or continue? Either way it looks like we will be delayed unless we try and fix it now.&quot; **
An MD protocol unit approached Lieutenant Rue.
(62703) M7: Ma&#39;am, is there anything you need done?
These droids were like protocol droids, though very disciplined and military in nature.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Ok. Then how long for repairs?&quot;
** (62699) Lieutenant Rue glanced up briefly to the droid, rubbing her hair with one hand &quot;a few.&quot; she says, leaning back into her seat &quot;Is the crew up to date on their immunity boosters?&quot; **
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees pionders on this for a moment before looking at the readings, and then back to his now superior with respect. &quot;Repairs might not be needed. I could manually adjust the course, but that could add time. I dont anticipate it being much more than two or five, but I could be wrong. It won’t take but one minute to change the course though.&quot; **
(62703) Lt. Horcia: I&#39;ll contact engineering.
(62703) M7: I shall check Ma&#39;am.
Horcia looked to Vorhees&#8230;.
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia: Sure you can handle that? I know you&#39;re new to this job.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees gives the Lieutenant a smirk and crosses his arms. &quot;I assure you I am more than capable.&quot; **
(62703) M7: It seems that some people have not been taking them&#8230;though this hasn&#39;t been completely rectified by other Medical administrators. This could be a problem if it persists.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees punches in what he needs to to make the corrections and tries to get them back on the most efficient course. **
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia: We&#39;ll leave that to the Lieutenant commander to decide.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees halts his actions and looks to kava, expectantly. **
(62699) Lieutenant Rue: is it possible to have a list prepared of these individuals?
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia: Yes Ma&#39;am.
(62703) M7 : Yes Ma&#39;am.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well then Lt. Vorhees keep us on course and try to get us there as close to the meeting time as possiable.&quot;
** (62703) Lieutenant Horcia seemed to sigh at the command, however very low key in his demeanor. **
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees resumes his attempt to correct the course. &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; **
(62699) Lieutenant Rue: Good, prepare one, I&#39;d like to look into this. Then I&#39;d like the inventory lists checked again, I want to make sure everything is accurate.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Communications, contact Bastion and let them no our new ETA.&quot;
(62703) M7: It shall be done Chief.
(62703) Comm Officer Ororan: Sir, it is very difficult to send a hypercomm transmission in hyperspace flight.
** (62699) Lieutenant Rue nods her head &quot;Thank you M7.&quot; she says, returning to attempting to right some idea of a speech. **
** (62703) Commander Oturis ***Subjugator Internal Comm*** Attention all key officers, you are needed in the Bridge Briefing Room as soon as possible. **
Vorhees noticed the drift has been reduced completely, the Subujgator has cut the travel time from 6 days to 5.
(62703) Helmsman Darkrott: Good work Lieutenant.
(62703) Helmsman Darkrott: I see you remember the basics at least from the Academy&#8230;.
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia: Shall I take the bridge Sir?
** (62699) Lieutenant Rue sighs and rubs her head, standing and stashing the speech with three words on it. She makes her way out, checking her staff and requesting a look over everything to be clean and sterlized; she didn&#39;t like the idea of not being prepared. She moves down the hall to the destination needed. &quot;what does he want now..&quot; she mumbles to herself. **
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well. Lt. Horcia you have the bridge.&quot;
(62703) Lieutenant Horcia: Yes sir.
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava heads to the briefing room. **
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees let a small look of pride come to his face as he nods &quot;Thank you Helmsman.&quot; Then the next words cause a frown to show &quot;Basics? Bah. I wish something would come along so I could show you what I can -really- do.&quot; He then looks up at the comm message and stands to go to the briefing room. **
(62703) Helmsman Darkrott: Well this giant piece of steel kinda flies itself ya know! Haha!
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees had to laugh at the remark. It was indeed somewhat true. **
Everyone arrives to the neatly cleaned briefing room&#8230;
The blue flourescent view of the hyperspace wormhole painted a light blue sheen to the crew members figures.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Well everyone&#8230;
The Commander remained standing&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: It seems we have new orders.
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava salutes the commander and takes his seat. **
(62703) Commander Oturis: and a new destination.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees remained standing as well, but looked at the Commander with contempt. **
(62703) Commander Oturis: Sit down Lieutenant.
** (62699) Lieutenant Rue makes her way to a seat, crossing her legs and glancing to the commander with a raised brow, sniffing the air for more drink. &quot;We&#39;re changing course again?&quot; **
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;But sir we are on course for the Bastion.&quot;
Their was no alcohol in the air.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees sits&#8230;after a few seconds of looking into his eyes. Oh..he wanted to gouge them out. Dashing the thought from his mind, he sits and gives a look to Rue, one of boredom. **
(62703) Commander Oturis: I&#39;m aware of that Lieutenant Commander.
(62703) Commander Oturis: We&#39;re to set a new course to the Shili System.
(62699) Lieutenant Rue: Shili Shystem? Why there?
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees remained confused at best. Why would they alter course now? he had just adjusted the ship! **
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Has something happened sir?&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: I can tell you details are sketchy at this time.
(62703) Commander Oturis: We are on a reconnaisance and intercept mission.
** (62708) Lieutenant Vorhees squirms in his seat with anticipation. Some more action! &quot;Question, if I may sir.&quot; **
(62703) Commander Oturis: Yes Lieutenant?
(62703) Commander Oturis: I don&#39;t know the nature of the Reconnaisance, or what we are intercepting.
(62703) Commander Oturis: But I can tell you this&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: We&#39;ve been ordered off the Sernpidal case completely.
(62703) Commander Oturis: That may disappoint some of you.
(62703) Commander Oturis: But apparently the nature of this mission has overrun the Sernpidal incident in priority.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Why is that sir? After all the work we have done.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: I&#39;m asking that question to myself&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: You know before we came to this ship&#8230;it was used for very menial and mundane tasks.
(62703) Commander Oturis: I can only speculate what the Moffs are thinking&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Either way, the Moffs instructing us directly&#8230;.can be drastically terrible.
The Commander seemed to keep a cold and calculated demeanor on the events unfolding.
He looked briefly to the wormhole and back to the crew.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Well it&#39;s out in the Expansion Regions.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Well out of our territory.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Something is going on&#8230;.so do your best around the ship.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Any questions for me?
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well sir. Orders are orders.&quot;
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava he hated wasted effort. The Moffs must be lossing their minds. **
The time was now 10 pm on the ship&#8230;the last two days you had been working around the clock. Clearly the crew of the Subjugator wa not used to this schedule.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Ok&#8230;set the new course for the Shili System of the Expansion Region.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very good sir. Will there be anything else?&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Halt the ship out of sensor range.
(62703) Commander Oturis: And then we will plan our mission and execute.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Let the crew know what I told you.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very good sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Dismissed.
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava with that Kava rises out of his seat and heads for the bridge. **
The rest of the men leave the briefing room.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Commander Kava, a word please.
** (62703) Commander Oturis makes sure the room thins out as he wanted to speak to the Commander in secrecy. **
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava haltsand truns to the Commander. &quot;Of course sir.&quot; **
(62703) Commander Oturis: I&#39;ve got two things to discuss.
(62703) Commander Oturis: First&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: There is more than I&#39;m letting on to the rest of the crew.
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava didn&#39;t like where this was headed. **
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Such as sir?&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Apparently, from the way the Moffs our speaking&#8230;we have encountered something beyond our pay grade.
(62703) Commander Oturis: I suspect that&#39;s why we&#39;ve diverted from the Sernpidal incident.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;That is not going to set well with our guest.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: I want him under close supervision.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Furthermore, keep a loose eye on Lieutenant Horcia.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I have him under control so far sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Good&#8230;.keep it that way.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Why is that sir?&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Just trust me on this ok&#8230;
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well sir.&#39;
(62703) Commander Oturis: I want you to report directly to me his actions and interactions with the crew.
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava really did like where this was headed. **
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Sir if I may?&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Go ahead&#8230;I&#39;d value your input more than you&#39;d know right now.
Oturis straightened his Imperial gray uniform out well.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Lt. Horcia has done nothing to my knowledge that warrents worrying about his loyalitys.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Noted.
(62703) Commander Oturis: But you have your orders.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;He does his job well. He is well liked from what I can see.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Yes&#8230;I understand.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Think of it as a performance evaluation.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;To frankly sir I spend most of my off duty time helping the Troopers.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: And that&#39;s just fine.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Our actions are being watched very closely&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: and by that&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: I mean you and I.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Has there been a problem with my performnce sir?&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: No
(62703) Commander Oturis: You&#39;ve performed well
(62703) Commander Oturis: Especially by your performance dossier&#8230;you do look outstanding on paper.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I try sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: My point being, the Moffs are watching the events of this ship&#8230;.
(62703) Commander Oturis: One is enough, but two Moffs&#8230;I think you can appreciate those implications.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I understand sir.I will keep the crew on there toes sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: The Medal you won&#8230;the Medal of Loyalty&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Apparently has made waves on Bastion&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: It&#39;s been years since a medal has been awarded in peace time.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Why is that sir?&quot;
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I did my duty to the Captain and the Empire.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: And the fact we have the Moffs attention&#8230;well I&#39;m sure you can guess what that means.
(62703) Commander Oturis: They&#39;re watching you&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Not just me anymore.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Are we understood?
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: I will need your full support in the times to come.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Are you with me?
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I will serve you as I did the Captain sir. That is my duty and responceablity.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Well Commander&#8230;
(62703) Commander Oturis: Go to your post&#8230;.bring the ship out of hyperspace, and get us underway to Shili.
(62703) Commander Oturis: I&#39;ll be in my office.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very good sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: I have reports to fill out&#8230;
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood sir.&quot;
(62703) Commander Oturis: A KIA report, ship damage, and after action reports&#8230;also all the events on Sernpidal must be gathered and documented.
(62703) Commander Oturis: I have my work cut out for me.
** (62702) Lt. Commander Kava salutes the Commander and heads for the bridge. **
(62703) Commander Oturis: I do not wish to be disturbed.
(62703) Commander Oturis: Until we arrive.
(62703) Commander Oturis: But give me the ETA to Shili.
(62702) Lt. Commander Kava: As he leaves. &quot;Understood sir.&quot;

### **Dreamwalker** (2011-01-26 12:12:40)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">The Moff&#39;s personal assignment</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Subjugator crew had just recently got underway to the Bastion System for a High Moff Council Meeting.
At the moment, you could see the luminescent blue hyperspace wormhole in all viewports. Some of you were thankful to be out of Coruscant air space.
There were whispers in the crew that something was about to change&#8230;
And apparently, Commander Oturis had received a transmission from Moff Kurlen Flennic&#8230;
That really had the crew buzzing as to what was to happen next.
Lt. Commander Kava and Commander Oturis were still in the briefing, the rest of you were tending to your ship duties.
(66515) Lt Horcia: Vorhees, how&#39;s the course setting? Are we still on track?
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees was at his controls&#8230;keeping an eye on things to make sure that there were no more deviations in the system. For the moment, he was relatively fixated on the screen when Horcia caught his attention. &quot;So far so good it seems, let me double check.&quot;
(66515) Lt Horcia: Very good Lieutenant, keep me posted. I don&#39;t want any more delays.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue sat at her desk, looking over the notes while she waited for a list of all personnel who had yet to have their vaccinations. So much to do&#8230;even in a ship there wasn&#39;t ever enough time; no matter, another day or..hours of sleep wouldn&#39;t kill her&#8230;impair a little but not kill. **
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Walking alone in the corridors of the Star Destroyer, Arkas Wylt had grown weary of just sitting around waiting for the next set of Imperial interrogators coming to interrogate him. He had played along for long enough now, but he figured he was wasting his time*
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees rolled his eyes in secret. He didn’t need any more delays either. He wanted to make sure he was doing his best, now that the upper brass seemed to be involved. **
The Naval Personnel eyed Arkas Wylt very cautiously as he wandered the halls.
Commander Oturis comes to the bridge&#8230;
(66515) Lt Horcia: Lieutenant Vorhees&#8230;
(66515) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant Vorhees&#8230;
(66515) Commander Oturis: Bring us out of hyperspace&#8230;.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Deciding to try and find the commander of the ship, he sets out for the bridge*
(66515) Commander Oturis: We&#39;ve got new orders&#8230;
The Commander tried his best to keep his demeanor against the constantly changing events.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees looks up surprised at the commander and nods with a salute, and brings the ship out of hyperspace finally. &quot;Went smoothly Commander, things are all go.&quot; **
The ship rumbles slightly throughout the bulkheads, and the craft stops within the silence of space.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue stands and moves to the medical bay joining her office, personally seeing to the distribution of medcines and vaccinations. It made her feel better to see it happening, though she kept off to the side mostly; she didn&#39;t need her staff thinking they weren&#39;t trusted. She pauses as a staff member after they had finished with a patient &quot;how are the vacinations coming?&quot; **
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava takes his place on the bridge. **
** (66513) Lieutenant Nssral walks up to Commander Oturis and salutes **
(66515) Lt. Torreen: Should take us a while Chief&#8230;
(66515) Lt. Torreen: But the whole crew should have them issued by tomorrow.
(66515) Commander Oturis: Yes Lieutenant?
** (66515) Commander Oturis returns the salute. **
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: Very good. Is everyone reporting in?
(66515) Lt. Torreen: Yes ma&#39;am.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue nods her head &quot;Good. Carry on then.&quot; she says. And moves off a bit to continue overseeing the vaccinations. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Lt. Vorhees Make course for the Shili System. Best possible speed.&quot;
Arkas Wylt arrives at the bridge,but two stormtroopers stopped him.
(66515) TK-220: Sorry, you&#39;re now allowed on the bridge without clearance.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *The dark figure looks at the stormtroopers opposing him, one by one* &quot;Must we do this every time? Just stand aside, I need to see the captain&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees blinks for a moment then says in an unsure tone &quot;Aye Sir&#8230;?&quot; He then moves his hands to the controls, and plots the course to the new destination before thrusting the ship to hyperspace. **
(66515) TK-220: Let me get clearance.
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+17] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [16,17] = (33)
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava noticing the Trooper stopping an Officer. He walks over to where it was happening. &quot;Trooper is there a problem?&quot; **
The navicomputer begins beeping and whirring at the command&#8230;.
(66515) TK-220: He wants to see the Commander.
Vorhees sees the planet Shili come up on his Comscan panel.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava turning to the Officer. &quot;I am not the Commander, but maybe I can help you.&quot; **
Coordinates locked in for Shili.
All systems green for hyperspace Vorhees.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Perhaps. I am just wondering how long I have to remain on this ship before you trust me enough to let me examine the artifact you have locked in your labs&quot;
(66515) Lieutenant Horcia: We ready Vorhees? How&#39;s it looking?
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees smirks happily with satisfaction &quot;All systems go. Prepare for lightspeed.&quot; **
(66515) Lieutenant Horcia: Very good&#8230;
The transmission is received for all crew members and passengers to prepare for hyperspace travel to the Shili System.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: Looking at Arkas Wylt. &quot;I will see if I can expedite things for you. After what happened to the Captain you&#39;ll have to understand the Commander not trusting you.&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees waits a few moments before punching it to lightspeed. He needed ground to walk on, soon. He was starting to feel cramped on this tub of metal. **
The massive engines of the Subjugator lit up with colossal energy.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Maybe so, but I&#39;ve been patient enough with all your interrogators, and answered all their questions. I&#39;d think the commander would be more concerned with the potential risk the artifact poses to his crew&quot;
The stars went into starlines, and you were now en route to Shili in a hyperspace wormhole.
Estimated time of arrival is 8 days to Shili.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue glanced to the viewing windows in the med bay a few times during her rounds on the med bay, first they dropped from hyperspace&#8230;now they&#39;re back again..what was going on up on the bridge? Shaking her head she returns to her office to go over the newly prepaired notes of the supplies. **
walks out to where Arkas and the Lieutenant Commander were standing&#8230;
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: Looking at Wylt. &quot;I understand and trust me I want that thing off my ship as soon as possible if not sooner. These things are not up to me I have to get clearance. So if you will please be patient I willtalk to the Commander.&quot;
** (66515) Commander Oturis walks out to the doorway in front of the bridge. **
(66515) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant Commander&#8230;
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Perhaps I should have a talk with him myself&#8230;&quot;
(66515) Commander Oturis: We&#39;re underway to Shili&#8230;
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava with that he moves toward the Commader. **
(66515) Commander Oturis: 8 days till arrival.
(66515) Commander Oturis: I&#39;ll be in my office going over those tasks I mentioned earlier.
(66515) Commander Oturis: You have the con while we are underway&#8230;understood Lieutenant Commander?
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees sits back in his chair and closes his eyes to relax. He felt he deserved it, and hell be damned if anyone tried to take it from him. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: Talking to Wylt.&quot;If you step on the bridge without clearance I will have you placed in the brig. Am I clear?&quot;
The time is now off duty&#8230;
2000, you guys are free to go to sleep or socialize.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Very well Kava, but I won&#39;t wait forever&#8230;am I clear?&quot;
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue was beginning to feel like all she did was look at notes and what needed to get done, or to stare at the desk when she half dozed off. Rubbing her eyes she attempts to make the words written make sense **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: Looking at Wylt. &quot;Crystal.&quot;
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Good&#8230;in the meantime, perhaps you could enlighten me on your current mission&quot;
** (66515) Commander Oturis ***On the Internal Comm*** **
(66515) Commander Oturis: Attention all crew members&#8230;
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava walking toward the commander. &quot;Sir I need to discuss something with you.&quot; **
(66515) Commander Oturis: Turn to your shift watches and you are now off duty.
(66515) Commander Oturis: We will arrive at the Shili System in 8 days.
(66515) Commander Oturis: Enjoy the down time while you can, when we get there the tempo will pick up.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue rolls her eyes &quot;some people don&#39;t have time for down time.&quot; she mutters. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: Talking to Wylt. &quot;That is a need to know basis and you do not need to know.&quot;
(66515) Commander Oturis: When we arrive at system, I&#39;ll need all key leaders to meet me in the briefing room for mission planning.
(66515) Commander Oturis: Oturis out.
Oturis retires to his office.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Very well&#8230;I am merely offering my assistance&quot;
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: Talking to Wylt. &quot;If we need your assistance, we know where to find you.&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees had drowned out everything the commander was saying, except downtime. Immediately standing, he looks to Horcia &quot;Im going to the med bay. Keep an eye on things while I am gone, thanks.&quot; he then turns on his heels and starts the trek to where Rue was, hopefully. **
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;No Kava&#8230;you don&#39;t&quot; *Wylt turns around and slowly leaves the bridge*
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue stands briefly, current notes in hand, and moves out of her office to look out to her staff. They needed the downtime more and she wanted to make sure they were using it well. **
Kava makes the short walk, and down one floor to Commander Oturis personal office.
He hits the door chime.
** (66515) Commander Oturis spoke through the panel speaker, “Come in&#8230;” **
Oturis&#39; desk was neatly organized; he appeared to be going over DD-214 files at the moment.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava walks into the Commander Office he salutes. &quot;Need to speak to you about Wylt sir.&quot; **
(66515) Commander Oturis: At ease Commander.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees arrives and walks in, hands behind his back as he looks around. There was an unusual stone expression on his face, though in his mind he was trying not to laugh. He wanted to see if he could intimidate the underlings of Rue before he talked with her. **
(66515) Commander Oturis: Go ahead.
The Commander had the top flap of his uniform unbuttoned; he was quickly making himself comfortable.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava does as he is told. &quot;I need clearance for Wylt to work on the artifact.&quot; **
He reached below and pulled out a bottle of Twin Suns lemonade.
(66515) Commander Oturis: Have a seat Kava&#8230;
(66515) Commander Oturis: You&#39;re always so damn gung ho.
(66515) Commander Oturis: You&#39;re not in the infantry anymore.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava walks over to the desk but remains standing. &quot;Was not aware that was a fault sir.&quot; **
The Commander looks at the LTC&#8230;but disregards that he declined his offer.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue looks over to the sound of door opening and rolls her eyes &quot;Unless you&#39;re here for your vacination, you&#39;re hurt or bleeding and about to die or in need of any form of medical attention; Get out.&quot; She turns back to what staff remained &quot;Go and get some sleep, you&#39;ve all earned the rest gained.&quot; She turned again to return to her office. **
The medical staff seemed grateful of Rue&#39;s order.
(66515) Commander Oturis: The artifact eh&#8230;
** (66515) Commander Oturis takes a sip of his drink. **
(66515) Commander Oturis: Well&#8230;
(66515) Commander Oturis: I reported it to the Moff&#39;s&#8230;.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes sir. He seems quite bothersome about it.&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees broke his concentration before walking behind her, a faint smile on his lips as he walks beside her &quot;I was hoping to have some talking time with you. After all, you never got to finish that drink I owed you&#8230;&quot; **
(66515) Commander Oturis: It’s to be kept under our strict supervision by our science and security personnel.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I understand that sir. Couldn&#39;t those same personnel keep him in check as well?&quot;
(66515) Commander Oturis: Well
(66515) Commander Oturis: You don&#39;t need to ask me&#8230;.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue rolls her eyes again, flopping into her seat, notes thrown to the table as she rubs her head &quot;Must you be so annoying?&quot; she sighs &quot;fine, I can&#39;t stare at my notes anymore.&quot; she rubs her eyes gently &quot;was there anything in particular you wished to speak on?&quot; **
(66515) Commander Oturis: You&#39;re in charge of ship tactical and security.
An M1 droid walked over to Lieutenant Rue.
(66515) M1 Droid: Ma&#39;am, I need your signature for the vaccination order.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava looks at the Commander. &quot;Am I to understand that if he does something it willbe on my head sir? **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees shrugged his shoulders but patted her head once before quickly withdrawing his hand and arm, for fear of losing it. &quot;I wanted to talk and see if I could just get my vaccination over with actually&#8230;right now.&quot; **
(66515) M1 Droid: We have all the vials collected and are about to issue.
(66515) Commander Oturis: That&#39;s correct&#8230;are you up to the task?
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue nods and waves the droid over &quot;Very well give it here.&quot; Briefly she&#39;d read over the order first; father had taught her never to sign anything without reading it. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can in a moment or two, sit.&quot; **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I willl handle the arrangements sir. Thank yousir.&quot; Kava salutes and waits to be dismissed.
(66515) Commander Oturis: One last thing Commander Kava&#8230;
(66515) Commander Oturis: I want you to get to know this person&#8230;keep an eye on him&#8230;
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes Sir.&quot;
(66515) Commander Oturis: Treat him like a friend if you must&#8230;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees sat and looked to the droid with a sudden idea &quot;Two drinks please. Also, I dont suppose I could ask you to listen in on something for me?&quot; **
(66515) Commander Oturis: But do not let him near that artifact.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood sir.&quot;
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: keep your orders to my droids and staff to yourself. Helmsman.
(66515) Commander Oturis: Two Moffs are definitely interested in this individual and I&#39;m counting on you.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;But sir?&quot;
(66515) M1: Drinks? That doesn&#39;t compute.
The droid begins to pull out an injection tool.
(66515) M1: Hold still Lieutenant.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue sets her signiture to the orders &quot;Ignore him M1, he&#39;s an idiot.&quot; She smirks and looks up to watch. **
(66515) M1: Yes Ma&#39;am.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees rolled his eyes and frowned to her &quot;Lt Rue&#8230;&quot; He then looks to the droid and blinks, then remains silent. Useless Droid. How could any droid be useful if they didnt know about drinks? &quot;Beverages.&quot; He then looks to Rue &quot;I was hoping youd give it to me personally&#8230;&quot; **
(66515) Commander Oturis: Yes Commander Kava?
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;That is the thing I asked about.&quot;
(66515) Commander Oturis: Like I said, keep him away from the artifact, and you personally see to it.
** (66515) Commander Oturis downs another shot of Twin Suns tequila. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well sir.&quot;
(66515) Commander Oturis: Carry on&#8230;
(66515) Commander Oturis: You can trade shifts with the First Officer.
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: M1 is more than capable of such a simple task. Sit there and take the shot like a good boy. And treat M1 with some level or respect, he&#39;s an excellent medical droid. I rather like him.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava didn&#39;t understand why Wylt could not work on the artifact but orders where orders. With that he turns and walks out of the Office. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees holds out his arm and sighs while looking to Rue &quot;As you wish Liuetenant.&quot; he then looks back to the droid, making sure he would keep a note of whether the droid did anything he was unsure of. He had had vaccinations before, from humans that did not have programs that could malfunction. **
M1 administers the shot.
slight pain trickled down Vorhees&#39; arm.
(66515) M1: Vaccination administered.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees winced before looking at the droid with narrowed eyes &quot;No antiseptic beforehand? You should be de-programmed&#8230;&quot; **
(66515) M1: Sir, this injector does not require antiseptic&#8230;it does not pierce the skin wide enough to warrant that.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava heads to his quarters and changes into his fatigues and heads down to the training room to find someone to spar with. He needed to keep his skills sharp and needed to think. **
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue chuckles faintly &quot;Make a note M1, for any show for this patient, antiseptic will always be used. Even for a bandage.&quot; She grins in amusement **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees was at a loss for words now, then gave a sigh &quot;My apologies then. Good job M1.&quot; **
(66515) M1: Yes Ma&#39;am.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees turns to look at Rue with a faint smirk &quot;A bandage&#8230;? Your mocking me arent you.&quot; **
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: Dismissed M1, go and enjoy some off time as well.
(66515) M1: Roger.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue gaze returns to the lieutenant &quot;indeed.&quot; **
M1 shuts down in front of you and leans forward.
He took off time quite literally, as he powered himself down.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees scoffs and stands with a slight rub to the area where he had the shot. &quot;Well&#8230;I appreciate the step taken. I would hate to die of some infection that could have been prevented, embarrassing way to go.&quot; **
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue blinks faintly and sighs, standing to move the droid to a corner, even going so far as to take a chair and sit him down to make him &#39;comfortable.&#39; She hated droids. But medical ones that were good were hard to come by, and she rather liked the raspy speaking droid. **
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: Aye I suppose that would be embarrassing for you. Among the other things that happen when the heart stops.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava after reaching the Training room. &quot;Sergeant. I think some Hand to hand training is in order. Must keep the skills sharp.&quot; **
A stormtrooper reports to Lt Commander Kava.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees gave a disgusted look before moving in close. &quot;I dont suppose you would let me persuade something out of you Lieutenant..?&quot; **
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava he begins to strech and ready himself. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees said with a sly grin. **
The stormtrooper removes his helmet.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue &#39;s eye twitched, turning to him she crosses her arms and glares &quot;and just what would that be. **
** (66515) Sergeant Killigan begins stretching as well&#8230;extending his arms back and cracking his chest. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Trooper. Do you wish to keep your armor on or remove it?&quot;
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: I&#39;ll keep it, minus the helmet.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Ah. Think I may hurt you Sargent?&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees leaned back and kept his smile. &quot;Well&#8230;I was thinking I might be able to persuade you into a back rub&#8230;&quot; **
The stormtrooper removed the rest of his armor&#8230;down to his work fatigues.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: No sir.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue &#39;s twitched again, hands clenching, no no&#8230;keep the temper&#8230;wouldn&#39;t do to kill an officer&#8230;at least not like this. &quot;no.&quot; she says and moves back to her chair, idly rubbing her neck. She&#39;d rather have a droid do it. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well. I will not hold it against you if you injure me then.&quot;
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: Roger Sir.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: Give me the order.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Anytime your ready Sargent.&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees had raised an eyebrow and gave a small laugh &quot;I had meant you give me one&#8230;But come on. I&#39;l even pay you credits for it. Fifty credits for one backrub.&quot; (making persuasion check) **
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: [1d20+6] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [20,6] = (26)
The sergeant takes a basic Teras Kasi stance
his legs were slightly wide&#8230;and just one arm was up next to his chest in a clenched fist.
He began shuffling forward.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue frowns faintly eyeing the helmsman before sighing and rolling her eyes &quot;Fine. go find a bed to lay on.&quot; She says waving her hand to the medical bay, standing to follow him **
Once the Sergeant got close enough&#8230;they vyed for position.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Initiative roll))
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: [1d20+11] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [20,11] = (31)
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava watches the sargent&#39;s movements. He did not have the same training as the sargent, but Mando hand to hand had servedhim well. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees moved to go lay on a medical bed, laying his head on his arms that were now folded underneath. &quot;I dont suppose I would have to take my shirt off for this, right?&quot; **
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((roll for initiative kava))
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [13,12] = (25)
The Sergeant acts quicker than Kava, as he sees a fist headed directly towards his head.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Grapple check or unarmed to hit roll&#8230;whichever you want))
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava was surprised at the Sargents speed. He trys to blockthe in coming blow. **
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Actually make an unarmed hit roll))
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue sighs and moves up to his side &quot;I&#39;m not about to let you forget you owe me credits for this.&quot; She says beginning at the shoulders. **
The punch connects with Kava&#39;s face.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Endurance check)
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: [1d20+6] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [11,6] = (17)
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees lets her hands start working at his shoulders, closing his eyes as he starts to become very relaxed. &quot;I was not going to forget Lieutenant. But I must admit, you are more skilled at this than I thought you would be.&quot; **
The Lieutenant Commander is stunned by the blow&#8230;
and is unable to gain focus as the Sergeant tackles him.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Grapple check))
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: [1d20+8] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [5,8] = (13)
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: ((Hangon.))

The Lieutenant Commander grabs a firm hold on the Sergeant&#39;s neck.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue purposefully uses a bit more force at one particular knot before easing up again &quot;of course I am. I took many classes to broaden my horizon of medical knowledge.&quot; **
The stormtrooper was most assuredly feeling pain, but he wasn&#39;t expressing it.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava having got the sargents neck. He trys to get him to submit. **
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Another grapple check))
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: [1d20+5] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [9,5] = (14)

(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Make an unarmed to hit))

The sergeant slips free and lands on his knees in front of Kava.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Initiative roll))
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees bit his bottom lip at the added force, but gave a sigh of content. &quot;Thats&#8230;admirable.&quot; He would be silent for now, until she was done. He had to have been extremely lucky that she had been willing to do this, credits or no credits. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: [1d20+12] &lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt;![=&amp;amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s=&gt; &ndash;&gt; [9,12] = (21)

The Sergeant quickly spins around and sweep kicks the Lieutenant Commander.
He put his knee into the neck of Kava&#8230;
Kava was clearly beaten.
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: Submit sir!
** (66515) Sergeant Killigan had firm control on Kava and held his arm as well&#8230;ready to apply pressure. **
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava looks at the Sergeant, and nods. **
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue mutters a few times as she works at various knots, from shoulders to uppwer back and down to lower back. It&#39;s slow, as it should be, and a final rub down after to ensure all muscles were relaxed. &quot;There lay still for a bit.&quot; she orders, pulling up a seat. **
the stormtrooper crawled off of Kava.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees had no objections to the order, and murmered to her that hed throw in an extra fifteen credits with how relaxed he felt now. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: Looking at the sargent while getting up off the floor. &quot;Very good Sargent. You would have made my father proud. I guess I need more practce.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue smirks and crosses her arms, taking his moment to relax a bit. **
** (66515) Sergeant Killigan salutes **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;No Sargent. That will be all.&quot;
** (66515) Sergeant Killigan begins putting his armor back on to return to his duties. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees turns to look at Rue, an appreciative smile on his face &quot;Thanks Lieutenant&#8230;I mean that.&quot; **
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue hums faintly. &quot;don&#39;t forget to pay up.&quot; **
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava Kava desides that he needed more practice. He heads over to an open area and goes through what his father taught him. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees shrugs his limp shoulders and says &quot;Credit chip, back pocket.&quot; **
(66515) Sergeant Killigan: ((Ok&#8230;advancing time))
After about 8 days of hyperspace travel, the Subjugator arrives a good distance out of range of Shili&#8230;in the expansion region..
Lieutenant Vorhees was at the helm.
No sensors had picked them up, and their were no craft on radar at the moment.
Most everyone was at their stations.
The Commander was nowhere to be found.
Lieutenant Commander Kava was running the bridge.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Sensing the ship leaving hyperspace, Arkas made his way towards the bridge*
No one had really heard from the Commander since travel had began.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava stands on bridge making sure everything runs smoothly. **
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue had moved towards the briefing room; with the lack of wormhole out the windows she figured it was about that time for the briefing. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees was busy at the helm, keeping both eyes on the helm and screen in front of him. Hopefully the Commander had been airlocked&#8230;That would be a nice surprise. **
whispering to Darth Anthrax, You sense a disturbance in the Force, emanating from Shili.
Kava knew that a transmission was to be sent to Moff Flennic once they arrived&#8230;
Hopefully the Commander had already done so.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Feeling a strong sensation from the planet below, Arkas quickened his pace towards the bridge, really hoping the stormtroopers would lay off this time, or he wasn&#39;t going to play nice*
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Communications. Has there been any transmission sent from the ship to Command?&quot;
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: Negative Sir&#8230;.
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: No outgoing transmissions to report.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue makes her way towards the bridge, no announcement yet for a reminder for those that were&#8230;.forgetful, she decided it would be best to ensure the commander wasn&#39;t drinking..or in a coma or something. Entering to the bridge she looks around. **
The crew of the ship were fast at work, most likely assessing their surroundings in space.
You could see Shili in visual range, but it was a distant blip.
Arkas arrives to two flanking guards at the bridge blast doors.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well. Send amessage to Moff Flennic. Informing him that we have arrived in the Shill System.&quot;
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: Yes sir&#8230;
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Not slowing his pace, the Sith moved on, casting sharp glances towards the guards that indicated it would not be a good idea to stop him*
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: ((Excuse the spelling.))
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: Commander Kava Sir.
(66515) TK-223: Halt&#8230;
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes Officer Ororan.&quot;
(66515) TK-223: You do not have clearance!
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: Sir, Moff Flennic wishes to speak to Commander Oturis.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well inform the Commander.&quot;
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: Yes sir&#8230;
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: Umm&#8230;
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: A garbled response&#8230;
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue moves up a bit towards the lietuenant &quot;Kava. Were we not to be meeting for a briefing with the commander?&quot; **
(66515) Comm Officer Ororan: Putting it to bridge comm&#8230;.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Mving into the bridge, Arkas looks around for the commander or whoever would be in charge, he was kind of hoping it would be Kava*
Commander Oturis: &quot;FIRK IT! IT WAS ALL FO&#8230;&#8230;thing&#8230;.what the hell&#8230;..why&#39;d she leave me?
Commander Oturis Said I could never do this job!
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue raises a brow at the transmision. **
The stormtroopers stay right behind Arkas&#8230;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees immediatly looks up at the commanders voice. If this was a suicide message then he would be ecstatic&#8230; **
(66515) TK-223: ALERT..INTRUDER ON THE BRIDGE!
(66515) TK-223: ON THE GROUND NOW!
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava looks at Rue. &quot;Yes but the Commander is not here as you can tell.&quot; He looks over at the comm station. **
You all saw Arkas strolling onto the bridge&#8230;
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Halting in his steps, Arkas turned around and looked at he trooper* Oh, give it a break will you
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Troopers stand down!&quot;
(66515) TK-223: Yes sir!
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue looks over to the so called intruder. &quot;Getting into all sorts of trouble today.&quot; **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Wylt what do you need?&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees blinks now at the incoming intruder and unholsters his weapon, only to re-holster it. Damn&#8230;he had been hoping for a fight. **
(66515) First Officer Horcia: Sir&#8230;should he be allowed on the bridge?
Comm Transmission: The firking Rebellion won&#8230;.what are we doing out here in the middle of nowhere?!
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Lt. Rue could you take some Troopers and see to the Commander please. The brig maybe a good place to straighten him out.&quot;
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;I just though you might want to know that I sensed a powerful disturbance in the Force on the planet below&quot;
** (66515) First Officer Horcia rushes to the comm panel. **
(66515) First Officer Horcia: Moff Flennic is demanding an update Commander Kava&#8230;
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue rubs her head and nods her head, waving to the troopers &quot;come on then.&quot; she says, leaving to find the commander. Best place to look would be the commanders room. **
(66515) First Officer Horcia: He wants to know why he can&#39;t get a hold of Commander Oturis.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Comms.Infrom Moff Flennic that the Commander is ill or something.&quot;
(66515) First Officer Horcia: Roger sir.
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: More like he is unfit for any sort of action. I say tell him he needs to be discharged&#8230;Just my opinion.
Helmsman Darkrott looked at Vorhees and smiled slightly.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Transfer the call to the breifing room. I will talk to the Moff there.&quot;
(66515) First Officer Horcia: Sir, he said he wants all key leaders to conduct mission planning, with or without the Commander.
(66515) First Officer Horcia: In the briefing room.
(66515) First Officer Horcia: Including our newest guest.
(66515) First Officer Horcia: He&#39;s to attend as well.
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: Kava stall or something. I&#39;ll get the commander or..detaine him.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue leaves quickly, jogging to the commanders rooms. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees calls to Rue as she leaves &quot;Make sure to evaluate him!&quot; **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood.&quot; looking at Rue. &quot;I will try.&quot;
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava makes his way to the briefing room. **
(66515) First Officer Horcia: **You&#39;ve all been summoned to the briefing room to the bridge**
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees stands with a sigh and moves off to the briefing room now, giving the other helmspeople a soft smile before leaving for the meeting. **
(66515) Helmsman Darkrott: Good luck.
(66515) Helmsman Darkrott: You&#39;re gonna need it.
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: &quot;Thank you Helmsman.&quot; he says before offering a friendly smirk, and then leaves.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue reaches the commanders room and rings at the bell of sorts &quot;Commander.&quot; she calls. **
No response.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue frowns and tries again. **
Vorhees, Wylt, and Kava all arrive in the briefing room.
You see someone face down with their head on the briefing table.
The person had no shirt on.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees moves immediately to the person and gives a sharp smack to the ehad &quot;Hey, you. Up now. We need this room.&quot; **
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava moves to the person in the breifing room a sleep. **
No response Rue.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue sighs and looks to a trooper &quot;tell me you have a way of opening the door.&quot; **
It was Commander Oturis, who smelled like dry Sarlacc breath that had been basking in the twin suns of Tatooine.
(66515) Commander Oturis: Yes Sir! Lieutenant Sir!
(66515) Commander Oturis: Lieutenant Vorhees&#8230;
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Troopers. Remove the Commander and take to medbay. Infrom Lt. Rue that he is on his way.&quot;
(66515) Commander Oturis: Patch us through to Moff Flennic&#8230;
(66515) Commander Oturis: now sailor.
(66515) Commander Oturis: Troopers disregard that idiots command.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees stood where he was. &quot;No sir, sorry sir. -You- need to sober up and get your drunken ass to the med bay.&quot; **
(66515) Commander Oturis: Firk you!
(66515) Commander Oturis: I&#39;ve got a job to do.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees punches the commander. **
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: ((Do I need a roll?))
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue moves to her comlink to speak to Kava &quot;Kava, there&#39;s no answer at the commanders door.&quot; **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Sir. your actions are a disgrace to the Empire. Report to medbay orI will have the Troopersremove you.&quot;
The Commander falls back into his chair and flips over&#8230;
He was unconscious.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees moves to sit at the table, a satisfied look on his face. &quot;There. Hel be easier to carry.&quot; **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Troopers. Remove him.&quot;
(66515) TK-117: Yes sir.
The stormtroopers drag the unconcious commander from the briefing room.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava looks at others in the room. &quot;That man is going to be the death of us yet.&quot; **
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue frowns at the comlink then the troopers that seemed to ignore her. &quot;Kava.&quot; she tries again &quot;There&#39;s no answer to the commanders door.&quot; **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Lt.Rue the Commander ison his way to medbay. Please make sure he is ok. I will take care of the Moff.&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees cracks his knuckles and looks to Kava with a bored look &quot;With all due respect, he needs to be dishonorably discharged or dealt with somehow. Also, Rue needs to be here in the briefing room.&quot; **
(66515) TK-117: **Rue must attend the meeting**
(66515) TK-117: **CMO must attend all briefings**
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well have the Lt. reporthere and some else can atend the Commander.&quot;
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue sighs and rubs her eyes, nice of someone to tell her that they found him. She looks to the troopers &quot;get back to your posts.&quot; She saiys, turning on her heel. She knew better. She needed to be at that meeting..though if she hurried. She moved quickly, keeping her eyes open to see if she&#39;d pass the commander on the way. **
(66515) TK-117: ((You won&#39;t two different areas.))
The HoloNet transceiver continued to bleep&#8230;
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: (aw)
It was no doubt Moff Flennic.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava activeates the Holo transevers. **
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue makes her way to the briefing room, stepping in as quickly as possible to take a seat &quot;the hell happened? where was he?&quot; she&#39;d ask as soon as she arrived. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees fills Rue oin on what happened while she was gone. **
The sharply dressed Moff appeared on screen, he seemed quite young for a Moff and had striking features&#8230;.and a cold demeanor.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Why have I been kept waiting Captain?
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Sir.I am sorry for the delay. The Commander was found drunk again.&quot;
** (66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic scoffs **
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: We don&#39;t have time for such foolishness.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees nodded his head in agreement. **
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Remove him from duty..
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Whose next in command?
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well sir.&quot;
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;That would be me sir. Lt. Commander Kava.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Ok&#8230;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: You all better listen up.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: I despise repeating myself.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Is the newcomer with you?
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes sir he is.&quot;
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees leaned back in his chair, and listened in, though thoughts circulated in his head. He desperately felt that the space of commander deserved someone like Rue&#8230;someone that could actually act. Not some sycophant or adjucant. Still though, he was interested in what was being said now. **
The HoloNet transceiver began chirping again, a second transmission from Moff Reyis incoming.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Is that you?
** (66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic pointing to the man in no uniform. **
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Yes, it is me&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Very well.
Moff Reyis appears next to Moff Flennic, he was older and had a black-greying beard.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Ahh&#8230;a pleasure Reyis&#8230;.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Look there&#8230;is that your man?
(66515) Moff Reyis: No&#8230;although he dresses similar.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic : Hmph.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic : Shall we proceed then?
(66515) Moff Reyis: Yes, of course&#8230;just make sure that they are well advised.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Ok&#8230;I&#39;m sure you all aware that things have been getting quite strange aboard your vessel.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: We have expected this to happen some time&#8230;we just didn&#39;t know when or where.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes. Sir. They have indeed.&quot;
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue leans back, strange didn&#39;t cover it. **
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: And as luck would have it, it&#39;s fallen into your laps.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Your operation status has just been updated to classified.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: No one outside of this room or key officers is to know of your mission.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: If they do, you must kill or destroy.
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava didn&#39;t like the sound of that. **
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Have you been detected Lt. Commander?
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: Yes Sir!
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: In the Shili System?
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: (not in responce to the detection thingy)
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Yes sir.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Ah, so you came out of lightspeed to close to the system?
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Is everyone on board incompetent?
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;We have not had any contacts sence we came out oflight speed.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Very well&#8230;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Moving on&#8230;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Standby to copy mission orders.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: No later than 48 hours, you are to travel to the surface of Shili.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: And complete two mission objectives&#8230;
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava activates the recording device. **
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Objective&#8230;Priority One&#8230;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Rendezvous with a unidentified contact&#8230;.by the name of Elecia Ell.
whispering to Darth Anthrax, Elecia Ell trained with you under Darth Strife, no doubt she was the disturbance in the Force.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Her location is unknown&#8230;.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood.&quot;
(66515) Moff Reyis: However&#8230;
(66515) Moff Reyis: You&#39;re new guest should be able to help you find her.
(66515) Moff Reyis: Based on what we know&#8230;.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;I&#39;ve already sensed her presence, Moff&quot;
(66515) Moff Reyis: As I expected&#8230;
(66515) Moff Reyis: Do we have your cooperation in this matter?
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Drawing his hands along his chin for a moment as if pondering the matter, Arkas nodded* You do, Moff, on one condition
(66515) Moff Reyis: What condition is that?
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees fidgets in his chair. This one must have a pair of brass balls to make demands of the Moff. **
(66543) Arkas Wylt: I am to be given free access to this Star Destroyer, and not be stopped whereever I go. And of course, to finally examine the artifact currently on board, which was my reason in coming here in the first place
(66515) Moff Reyis: Permission granted.
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue frowns faintly, why was that artifcat so damn important? **
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: artifact*)
(66543) Arkas Wylt: Thank you
It was odd the Moff didn&#39;t hesitate at all.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees spoke finally. &quot;Sir, I have a question.&quot; **
** (66552) Lt. Commander Kava was glad that something was being done about the artifact. **
About being given free reigns on a Star Destroyer.
(66515) Moff Reyis: Yes Lieutenant.
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: It is more of a concern, really. Why should he be given free reign? I suggest that he be given an escort when going to certain areas if only to keep him from doing&#8230;unnecessary things. Personally, I dont want him able to be anywhere near my helm&#8230;at all. But if he is going to be given free reign I at least want some assurance, and insurance, that he will not cause any trouble&#8230;.no matter how valuable he may be for this mission.
(66515) Moff Reyis: I&#39;m not concerned with such petty matters Vorhees. If you are afraid then feel free to carry your standard issue.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees continues. **
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: Petty? One wrong touch to my controls and the entire safety of the Star Destroyer and crew would be in jeapordy.
(66515) Moff Reyis: Lieutenant&#8230;you have your orders&#8230;
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: Sir I&#39;m inclined to agree. To go from no appearence without troopers, to going anywhere will make crew members uneasy and less able to focus on their work.
(66515) Moff Reyis: I can have you transferred&#8230;or otherwise.
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: One escort will be simply peace of mind.
(66515) Moff Reyis: He is to be treated as a guest.
(66515) Moff Reyis: Not as a hostile.
(66515) Moff Reyis: Do I make myself clear?
(66543) Arkas Wylt: &quot;Moff, if I may&#8230;paerhaps I can ease their minds&#8230;&quot;
(66520) Lieutenant Rue: Sir even guests have escorts.
(66546) Lieutenant Vorhees: A guest is an outsider.
(66515) Moff Reyis: I&#39;m aware of that.
(66515) Moff Reyis: My orders stand.
(66543) Arkas Wylt: *Turning towards Rue and Vorhees, Rkas smiled* &quot;Look, if I don&#39;t want you escorts around me, they won&#39;t be. But if it makes you feel better, I promiswe not to misbehave&quot;
(66515) Moff Reyis: And do not question them again!
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue sighs faintly &quot;Sir we are not saying he be treated as a hostile, we are requesting an escort for peace of mind until some area of trust is assured.&quot; **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees turns to Arkas and glares &quot;Your word means nothing to me. I dont even know you.&quot; He then turns to the Moff and says &quot;Yes Sir.&quot; **
(66515) Moff Reyis: Commander, get your officers in line, before I do.
(66515) Moff Reyis: Otherwise they&#39;ll be on the next transport shuttle full of bantha poodoo.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees was in line, he had just said yes sir. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Lt. Rue. Lt. Vorhess! You will stand down now! that isan order.&quot;
** (66515) Moff Reyis smiled with a sadistic look on his face. **
** (66515) Moff Reyis obviously loved power. **
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees would remain silent. The Grand Moff would hear of this. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;The Moffs have given us orders and they will be carried out. Is that understood?&quot;
** (66520) Lieutenant Rue turns a glare at Kava, it was never a good idea to piss off a medical officer. especially when vacinations had yet to be administered. &quot;Kava.&quot; she said, in that low warning of a tone. Her gaze turns to the new person &quot;You best behave&quot; **
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: SILENCE!
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: This is a mission briefing&#8230;.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees turns to Kava and says in a respectful tone &quot;yes Sir, but good luck finding a decent replacement if he does something out of line.&quot; **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;I apolgize for my Officers. They willbe dealt with.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: No apologies&#8230;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: We have this break down again Commander, and its your head.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Literally.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood Sir.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Priority one
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Establish contact with Elecia Ell On Shili&#39;s surface, using the new comer as a guide.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Mission Objective: Priority Two&#8230;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Establish an assessment on the current political climate of Shili.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Their everyday life, their culture, crime&#8230;.the whole works.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood sir.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: I want positive action to let them know the Empire is on their side.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: You should be able to stop by a city on the way towards Elecia.
** (66546) Lieutenant Vorhees was starting to wonder just what in the blazes happened to finding out information about the possible gravity weapon.. **
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood Sir. Are we to offer aid or help in anyway?&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Do not go fully battle equipped&#8230;.but you are green light to request clearance from the Shili locals about your armanent.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Yes&#8230;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Please do so.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Aid them in any way you see fit.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Very well sir.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: However, large sums of monetary payment or resources must be cleared by your Sector Admiral.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: You are to commence planning, and to be on deck within 3 hours.
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Gather all the information you need to make the mission a success&#8230;put all your men to work&#8230;and execute.
(66552) Lt. Commander Kava: &quot;Understood sir.&quot;
(66515) Moff Kurlen Flennic: Any questions?
