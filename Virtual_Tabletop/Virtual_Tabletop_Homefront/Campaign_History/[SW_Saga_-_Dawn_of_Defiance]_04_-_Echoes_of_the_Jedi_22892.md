After forcefully taking over the YT-1300 designated by Verena as a likely candidate for use to infiltrate the Imperial Navy R&D station orbiting the world of Denon, you are now well on your way to complete the plan to gain access to a navigational array, which would be used to navigate a course through the dense asteroid field surrounding Almas.

Ploss goes to the rest of the group "So... what's the rest of the plan for this mission?"

Ardon looks at Ploss, the Twi'lek still recovering from his dreadful wounds, anger in his eyes.  "I can't prove it, but I know you ordered those goons to attack us.  Especially when you told them to keep an eye on us."  He points a blue finger at him.  "I want an explanation…"

### **thelastfool** (2009-01-22 15:28:37)

Ploss with a mischievous smile, looks at Ardon. "Well I needed a distraction to keep most of crew occupied, while I went after the captain. So I thought you Jedi wouldn't have any problem with that. Plus aren't you taught that you can learn more from a defeat then a victory."

"Oh don't get your saber in a twist Adron. If Ploss had tried something underhanded I would have put a blaster blot in his hide before he took another step." Talon smiles at Ploss. "Nothing personel just bussiness. You understand?" Talon checks on the rest of his friends and make sure that ther medicl needs are met and injurys are taken care of.

### **hayabusa** (2009-01-22 23:26:35)

"I've definately learned to keep an eye out, that's for sure," Ardon says as he takes a seat, still not completely trusting Ploss.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **thelastfool** (2009-01-23 11:50:59)

"Well technically I did do something underhanded. I basically just betrayed one employer for another because of money." Ploss stops and thinks for a moment and then looks at Ardon. "You know I think a 'real' Jedi could have handled those guys easily. Ardon what proof do you have that you're a Jedi. When we found you, you were a prisoner of the Empire and told us that you were one. The reason you have a lightsaber right now is because one of the other glowy stick weilding idiots got killed and you got their's. So don't blame me if you can't live up to your lie."

Brome walked up ejecting the power pack out of his gun "You know what would everyone just calm down for a fracking second, we're still on a mission. Now we're going to use this ship and lie our way in. I'll change the records so that we're the crew and if you don't like it then you can get off *my* ship" he said as he loaded a fresh pack "Now I can fly this ship and the fact the Ploss was part of it's crew he would know a few things about what this ship was doing and that gives us the edge. Now you guys and pick who's flying the other ship" he said as he walked towards the cockpit "Ploss lets clean the ship a bit before we head out" he said looking over his shoulder

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **hayabusa** (2009-01-23 18:07:21)

For one of the first times in his life, Ardon is thankful for Brome's interference.  Without, he knows, the anger over Ploss' accusations would have resulted in the Nautalon being hurled straight into the nearest wall.  It doesn't completely abate the anger, however.
"I assure you that I am a Jedi, but even we can get blindsided from time to time.  We're not infallable." he says through clenched teeth.

### **thelastfool** (2009-01-23 23:53:20)

Ploss says some things in Anselmian and then turns to follow Brome "Brome this is *our* ship. The Jedi can take the other one."

### **ganthet** (2009-01-24 00:39:47)

"Hey waht about me." Talon looks at Brome and Ploss. "I can fly this boat and the rest of you can argue over who was right and who was wrong. But I am getting paid good credits to complete a mission."  Talon heads up to the cocpit. "I am going to start pre-flight, when you guys are done we can head out." Talon gets alittle tried of the constated argueing between his freinds. If they spent as much energy fighting each other as thee Empire this war would be over.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Vash** (2009-01-24 10:22:13)

Brome looked at Talon and Ploss but didn't say a thing "Ardon would you kindly ansk if anyone over there can pilot the ship." he said calmly "I have some records to change up." Brome walked to the main computer terminal and started working on changing the records around

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **hayabusa** (2009-01-24 16:41:14)

"Oh, I think I can fly this thing myself," the Twi'lek Jedi replies, "but if it comes to a space battle…" he pauses for a second.  "I'm not too good at that."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Vash** (2009-01-24 23:21:38)

"Don't worry about space battle, We'll take care of that. Look I may not like you much right now but I know I can trust you to be honest. So I don't want you dead" he said said over his comlink as he looked at all the info he could at the computer terminal

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **ganthet** (2009-01-26 17:09:04)

Setting in the cocpit, Talon looks over the monitors and controls. He is framilar with most of them from his years as a CorSec officer. "This shouldn't be to hard." He getts ready to warm up the engines and get this boat moving. "Anyone want to help with pre-flight it would be great." He says very his commlink.
((OCC: Computer use +11 and Mechcanics check +11 to get the engines warmed up and pre-flight.))

Ploss figuring that issues involving who gets what can be decided later. He begins to do a mental check to see if he forgot about anything. Ploss then remembers about the doctor aboard the ship and that he hasn't finished off the ship's captain yet. He pulls out his vibroblade and heads to where he left the captain. He prepares to deliver the Coup de Grace, thinking *it's a shame that you weren't a more skilled enemy, but I'll at least give you a honorable death…. WAIT!* Ploss stops what he is doing and stands there thinking, after getting the feeling that something about all of this is wrong. *Why was this man my enemy? Only the Jedi and Empire they created are my enemy. This person is neither of those. In fact not along ago I would be fighting to protect ships like this from pirates, not handing them over.* Ploss puts away his blade and gets out his comlink. He calls Brome and Talon on the comlink. "Brome, Talon whats happened to our employer? When did we start attacking people that are not Imperials or  tried to kill us first? Basically, when did we become the bad guys.... I'm moving the captain to a safe place until we're done." Ploss takes the captain to where the ship's doctor should be.

Having made their way onto the Imperial Navy R&D base; ARdon, Brome, Ploss and the newest "conspirator" Lucien were led to a cell block. There they found a rather sick Cathar who had caught a virulent strain of what a nearby scientist called the flu. As two stormtroopers were preparing to take the Cathar to the parties stolen ship, the Cathar made a miraculous escape.
Though having failed in procuring a weapon, the Cathar is now free.
Ploss made a daring attack on one of the Stormtroopers hitting him square in the chest.
Ardon attacked the other Stormtrooper, but the trooper dodged aside.

### **Darren** (2009-02-07 23:34:24)

Lucien plans to stay out of this battle as he is still unsure if the empire is evil. However should the Storm Troopers give him no other option (by attacking him, or otherwise indicating he is hostile), he will do the only think he can think of and crash tackle the one he is standing near wrestling with him for the blaster.

Talon and Kyle are in the hanger bay with the ship in the process of unloading the cargo into the station. They are unaware of the fight.
(Sorry, forgot to say what the other part of the party was up to))

### **hayabusa** (2009-02-09 15:42:28)

Ardon switches his blaster back to its kill setting and takes aim at the Stormtrooper he missed.  Without any hesitation, the Twi'lek Jedi pulls the trigger.

Stragos moves so he is not in the cross fire towards the other players.

---

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Alicia** (2009-02-09 16:54:33)

Stragos attempts to retreat, taking cover behind his supposed new allies, but his action causes the two STs next to him to fire a shot off at his retreating form. He is hit by one stun blast (Stragos: 10 Damage, -1 step on CT)
The four stormtroopers turn and take aim on Lucien and Ardon, seeing them as the major threats. Both Ardon and Lucien are able to dodge the incoming attacks. The two closest stormtroopers retreat into the security room, joining their comrades. Ploss takes an swing at one of them as they retreat just barely missing.
Brome follows the retreating Stormtrooper and is able to end up adjacent. Firing two rapid bursts he takes out the stormtrooper (ST1).
Lucien attempts to disarm one of the attacking Stormtrooper and fails to keep a firm grip on the rifle.
Ardon, after switching his blaster out of stun, moves and fires on the same Stormtrooper as before. That is.. if his blaster hadn't jammed.
Since the Stormtroopers have moved out of range Ploss moves into position to make an attack next round.
Begin Round 2

Stragos moves to ST1 and picks up his Blaster then moves to cover and is using whatever actions are left as recovery actions.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-02-10 07:03:21)

Lucien regrets the necessity of his actions, but he isn't about to let them kill him. Having failed to disarm the Stormtrooper he resorts to the simplest method remaining to him to handle the situation and moves in to punch the Stormtrooper in his armoured head.

As Talon is helping Kyle unload the cargo. "I didn't sign up to be a loader droid you know. What is taking those guys so long." Countinueing to unload the ship. "This is a waste of my talents I am a pilot and medic and when the need calls for pretty handy with a blaster. i should be helping them not hanging around the ship." Talon is just complain because when they get back he will have to patch them up or go and save there hides as usall.

### **Alicia** (2009-02-10 17:52:25)

Stragos moves into the main room, picking up the dropped rifle. (Blaster rifle, damage 3d8. Weapon is currently set to stun.) No recovery actions were taken.
The Stromtroopers switch their rifles to lethal and coordinate their attacks on Lucien. Even though they concentrated fire on Lucien, their shots missed
Brome takes aim on one of the stormtroopers (ST3). The force of the blast hits the stormtrooper directly in the chest and the splash hits his adjacent allies. The target Stormtrooper collapses, unmoving.
Lucien takes a swing at the closest Stormtrooper who fires a quick shot off at him. (Lucien: 22 damage). The retaliatory shot from the Stormtrooper surprises Lucien causing him to miss.
Ardon takes aim on the closest trooper (ST2) and fires, hitting the trooper in the chest. The trooper collapses.
Already in position for his attack Ploss takes a swing at the remaining Stromtrooper, dropping him to the ground.
End Combat!

With the Stormtrooper laying dead on the floor you are unsure whether an alarm has yet been set off by the commotion caused by the discharged weapons. The sick and delusional Cathar who you are supposed to be transporting is now armed with one of the dropped blaster rifles.

Stragos is leaning against the wall shivering blaster rifle in a ready position but not pointed at anyone. "What are you going to do with me? I will not go willingly to be experimented on more." Looks each of you in the eye trying to gauge your motives. ((Perception +10))

Brome smiles "Well if you don't want to be a lab rat, then you join us and smash some imperial skulls or do like I do and turn them into something that would be served for diner at prison" he says with as smile as he walks over with his canon across his shoulders and his hand held out "I'm Brome by the way, what's you name?"

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-10 23:24:30)

Eyes Brome cautiously. Stragos obviously has trust issues and more than a little fear. "Stragos" reluctantly shakes Bromes hand. Brome notices that Stragos is very warm and clammy. He obviously is running a fever. Bends down cautiously watching everyone as he takes the storm troopers utility belt. Somewhere around here I have equipment. If it is stilll here.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-02-11 04:01:00)

Lucien looks at Stragos, holding one of his hands to his ribs where the Storm Troopers blaster bolt grazed him, and says with pain obvious in his eyes, "Well I don't know about you, but I'm heading back to the ship so I can treat this." he bends down and uses his other hand to scoop up one of the discarded blasters which he holds awkwardly in one hand, "and you could really use some treatment for that fever, assuming you'll let me try."

### **hayabusa** (2009-02-12 21:37:39)

"I wouldn't really recommend it, Lucien," Ardon says as he holsters his blaster pistol.  "I'm afraid that there are going to be Imperials galore within the next few minutes.  Looking for us and," he points to the hurt Cathar, "looking for our new friend."

---

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Alicia** (2009-02-14 13:12:33)

Still there has been no indication that an alarm has been raised, but it's only a matter of time before you are discovered.
You still need to find the advanced sensor array, which will probably be found in one of the labs.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-02-14 20:49:34)

Lucien looks at Ardon, the blaster still held in one hand as his other hold the graze on his chest and asks "What would you suggest then?" his eyes still filled with pain, and his voice filled with more then a hint of impatience.

---

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **hayabusa** (2009-02-14 22:00:35)

Ardon thinks for a brief second.  "If you think you need to go back, then go back.  Just be careful, though, that's all I'm saying."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Vash** (2009-02-15 12:26:30)

Brome looked at Stragos "Well nice to meet you." He turned looking at the other "Ok we've got a mission here so let go before more canon fodder shows up" he said with a big smile. Brome looked around and headed over to the security console "Ok lets see if this thing will tell me anything"
(( use computer +10 ))

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-02-16 02:42:25)

Lucien smiles at Ardon's comment and says, "I'm definitely not going back on my own, not with just a blaster to protect me. I guess I'll have to hang around with you guys until we head back to the ship. I would appreciate it if you'd keep an eye out for a first aid kit or something so that I can bandage this wound." gesturing at the graze along his side.

You all make it to the ship and Kyle and Talon are already in the process of powering it up. They maneuver the ship out of the bay and after exchanging some weapons fire the ship jumps into hyperspace. You jump back to the coordinates you left the Glorious Chariot and then take both ships back to the rendezvous with the Resurgence.
Upon arrival Ardon handed over the blueprints to the sensor array and the crew on board immediately set to work in building it. A few days later the are ready to install the device onto the Glorious Chariot. The YT you hijacked is currently being refitted and has been marked off limits.
You are given an additional day to prepare for your trip, in that time the Resurgence has been making its way as close to the Almas system as possible.
(( If there was anything else you wished to do before taking off for Almas now is the time to declare. ))

Stragos is outfitted with armor and gear to help with the current struggle. He seems despondent at the news that the general he served under is likely dead and the Republic that he served with honor is now a dark and twisted reflection. He tries to catch up on what he missed in the last couple months as a prisoner.

### **Darren** (2009-03-03 03:38:21)

Lucien wants to identify the vial of liquid he was given to dose Stragos with should his illness get worse, he is curious to discover whether it would have helped or given the nature of the facility would have been harmful.
He also plans to treat his own wounds, and those of anyone else that is willing to let him do so.
He will also prepare his gear from his quarters for transport should they decide to transfer to another ship, still unsure whether the Empire is evil, but at least willing to give these people a chance to change his mind.

After facing off against the T'salak and it's illusions the resulting conflict finding Brome dead by Ardon's hand. Talon has gone off to continue the exploration of the second sublevel. Lucien and Ardon are dragging Brome's headless body with them as Lucien did not want want to leave his body there.
Talon has headed to the western part of the complex, taking the northern most corridor from the underground park where you faced the T'salak. There is one door in this section and the the hallway ends with another corridor heading south (making an L). Heading to that hallway a door on either side can be seen before the hallway once more ends and another begins heading back toward the park.

Talon walks along untill he finds a place to rest and check his wounds. Finding a place that will work he take off his his gear and starts to check his wound. Setting his med kit down on a box or create near by he pulls out a med pac and starts to work. He takes him time realizeing that working on himself would harder.

Ardon slowly gets up from his seated position and retrieves his lightsaber, hoping against reality that it will never be used for evil purposes again. After rearming himself, he goes to help Lucien carry Brome's body.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-04-06 08:30:06)

Lucien begins with Ardon's help to start moving Brome's body from the chamber where it fell back toward the surface where he could at least have a proper burial if nothing else.
While he is doing so his thoughts are racing, not so much with thoughts of Brome although he did like the guy from what little he knew about him, most of his thoughts seemed to involve how to keep Ardon from breaking down completely.

Al'verde checked his navcomputer "Ok this is the right planet" he says checking his landing site "Matsun get ready to his the ground running there may be a ground fight." As he approches he make sure all weapons are live and ready to go as are the sheilds. As the Shadow Spire lands at the academy Al'verde checks the area for an hostiles and then sets the ship down. The two mando's walk out of the Firespray-31 with weapons ready and searh the area before walking down the ramp. "Matsun lets check the academy and see if anyone headed inside" just as he says that he sees two poeple leaving with a headless body. Al'verde sighs "They already got someone killed." he mutters "Time to shape them up." he says as he starts walking towards the two people

Ardon glances up at the newcomers with a cautious eye. His hand drifts slightly towards his lightsaber before he stops himself. The urge is great, however, but is finally surpressed. "Who are you?", he asks cautiously.

Lucien raises his blaster as best he can with his free hand aiming it toward the newcomers and says, "I have to second my friend here, who are you?"

Al'verde looks at the man with the blaster and smiles, but his helmet prevents anyone from seeing it. Al'verde stands 6'8" tall and is built like a tank. His armor is black and easily identified as mandalorian. He also has a blaster cannon mounted to his right shoulder and on his left arm there is a small shield just barely covering the power hammer, while his holds a heavy assault blaster rifle with a grenade launcher attached to the under side. Matsun on the other hand is slightly shorter and not quite as built, but between the mandalorian armor and the heavy repeating blaster rifle, with vibrobyonet, he's almost as dangerous as Al'verde.
Al'verde walks froward keeping his rifle lowered as Matsun follows behind him "Who am I?...I'm the guy that going to save you rag tag team from getting killed." he says looking at Bromes' headless body "But it looks like I'm too late. Sergeant Al'verde Verd'yc but you can call me Al." he says as Matsun stands silent "and unless any of you have a military rank that puts me in charge."

'Damn it to the hells...' Ardon thinks as the armored warrior speaks to them. "It was me," he admits. "I did it. There was this beast in there that was able to cloud our minds. I didn't know it was him until I killed him and the illusion shattered."

Lucien keeps his blaster pointed at the heavily armed man as he studies the man's weaponry in detail. "Quite an arsenal you have there, but I suppose the biggest question is can you use it? Or is it just for show? Oh and if you wouldn't mind keeping your distance for the moment, we have a friend to bury."

Al walks over to Ardon, ignoring Lucien's request, and puts his hand on Ardon's shoulder "Well at least you've got the gut so admit you did." he says in a calm tone "Well all make mistakes...trust me I've got a long list myself, but as long as you learn from it then something good will come out of it." Al turns and looks at Lucien "And as for the weapon...you really don't know anything about mandalorians do you. We don't do things just for show you di'kut." he says looking around "What were you planing on using to dig up the dirt anyways?" After a second or two Al looks back at Matsun "Matsun We need a proper grave for this solider, go grab a large piece of of scrap armor and bring it back here." Without a word the other mandalorian walks back to the ship and comes back with a large piece of red metal. Al pulls a cutting torch out of his tool kit and looks up "What was his name?"

"Brome. And to be honest, we never actually thought about how we were going to bury him." He points to an area near where the Firespray set down. "We already had to build a pyre for our other Jedi when one of those," he points to one of the lizard corpses, "got him when we first set down here. Not to mention it's good to have a way off this rock…"

Talon finishes up working on his wound and then start to check over his gear and put away his med gear. Stilll feeling down about what happened to his friend, he decides he needs to make those two sleemo at least gave Brome a proper barial. Putting on his gear and he starts to hear back the way he came trying to find his team mates. When he does he is met be a site. There was a firspray and a man in armor that made him look like a heavilly armed loader driod. Looking over at Ardon and the others. "Well I didn't realize we had company on the rock." He focuses on Ardon. "I am going to give you this one time. If you feel like killing another one of us comtalk to me and I will make neither of us walks away from the fight. Understand me?" The venom can be heard in Talon's voice. He ment every word of it. "Looking back at the new commer. "The name is Talon Rann, CorSec agent I am undercover so to speck. I am more free lance of late."

Al stars cutting the name Brome into the plate "Sergeant Verd'yc and my friend here is Matsun" he says pointing to the man behind him "And if any one kills any other squad members they deal with me and only me" he says standing up "You have a problem with that deal with it! You people need someone to take charge so I'm taking that role." Al looks at everyone one around "Jedi you're with me." he says as he looks at Talon "You want him you have to go through me and Matsun first and don't worry and we can handle ourselves and deal with a jedi if need be." he says as he slams the armor into the ground making a marker

"No problem, I can follow orders." Talon says looking at the sargent. "Did our Employer send you or is this something you desided was nesicary?" Talon realizes that he might be able to get throught one of them the other was going to stop him. Best to let go for now. "We made it a little ways further not much else down there caves and tunnel mostly. What would you like us to do? We still have a mission to complete."

Al looks at him and nods "Good." he says as he starts digging. Matsun soon kneels down digging with some spare armor. He helps give Brome a proper soldiers grave and then looks to the others "Ok we need to head back down there so we can find the jedi and complete your mission." he says as he stats walking with Matsun following.

Ex Returns from a short exile. His Processors are attempting to comprehend the events that took place, and how they were even possible. He knew that the force can signifigantly alter any number of scientific laws and theorys, but this was taking it to an extreme. He thinks it is only nessecary to attend brome's "Burial". This was an other organic pratice he didn't understand. Why would any being find solace in reawakening old feelings and memories of a person, after there passing. heis only starting to understand why organics were so effected by death. A living body, and a dead body have the same amount of molecules, same about of atoms and same chemical consistancy. What changes besides the rapid motion of their heart and the funtioning of their brain? He attends Bromes burial regardless, more curious of what is ailing his systems, and curious of the various passing rituals. He spots two new armored individuals. His scans the acstetic designs, and recognizes that they are of mandalorian origin. "Copaani gaan?" he says, seeing the burial process of brome.

Lucien seems more amused by the newcomers then anything else although he tries and keeps a cautious eye on them while helping out with the burial however he can. Once Brome is buried he then turns his attention to less important issues like the wounds he has sustained so far, and their treatment.

Al looks around as he points Matsun to stand on the other side of a door he spots down a hall to the south of the stairs. He approaches the door and makes sure his stun grenades are loaded and his rifle is set to semi-auto. He opens the door and sweeps the room, kneeling, with Matsun sweeping over his shoulder.

Lucien points out the tunnels to those that haven't noticed them that are nearby, and says, "Well I don't know about the rest of you, but I think a strategic withdraw back to the main chamber might be a good idea at this point, the creature clearly has the advantage around here with these tunnels." his eyes seem calm as he says this not so much afraid as unwilling to put himself in unnecessary danger.

(( Before I start here's the tally I have:
Jason and Lucien spent 3 DPs last combat. If anyone else spent DPs and I missed it please let me know.
Ardon is at 47 HP -5 CT
Al 0 HP -5 CT
Lucien 0HP -5 CT
Stragos 0HP -5CT
Kyle and Talon are at full.
If my tally is incorrect please let me know ))

Kyle and Talon stayed behind to keep an eye on the Twi'lek until Matsun made his appearance to take him back to the ship. Meanwhile the others (Ardon, Al, Lucien and Stragos) were assaulted by exceedingly fast aliens who look like gargoyles. Knocked unconscious they wake to find themselves in another, smaller room. This room was once sleeping quarters for the a couple of the resident Jedi. Like the rooms Ardon and Stragos had found earlier the beds still have their sheets on them though the are slowly decaying.
All of your weapons and commlinks have been stripped from you and your hands have been tied behind your backs. In the case of Al, his helmet has been removed and the weapons have been removed from their mounts. There are no signs of your captures.
(( If you were at 0 HP, you now regain 8HP and +1CT (everyone is at -4 CT) ))
Talon and Kyle realize something is wrong. The sounds of combat have died down and you have not heard from your companions. The Twi'lek continues to stare at the hilt of the broken lightsaber, unresponsive to any efforts to cajole him to action.

Ardon wakes up, head aching as well as his body. He slowly breathes in the moldy air, trying to get his breath back. (spends as many swifts as he can until something big happens to put him up the condition track.)
"Anyone else here?" he asks. You okay?"

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Vash** (2009-05-03 16:52:29)

Al opens his eyes not moving until he feels better (12 swifts). As he looked as around he nodded to Ardon "Yeah they got me too." As he tries to stands up he looks around the room for Lucien letting out a low almost inaudible growl

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **hayabusa** (2009-05-03 23:27:48)

"I've been better," Ardon groggily replies. He looks around the area again. "And if I ever see them again in a millenia it would be way too soon."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-05-04 07:31:23)

Lucien opens his eyes looking around the situation casually noting the presence of the others and the fact Al is distinctly unhappy with him but it doesn't seem to effect his current disposition possibly because of the splitting headache he no doubt has and is trying very hard to hide.
"I'm going to guess we didn't win. I guess I really did have to do it all myself."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Vash** (2009-05-04 08:11:35)

Al turned and looked straight at Lucien "Yeah you did do all yourself and if your lucky by the time I get my weapons back I will only shoot you with the stun setting." he said making sure he kept himself away for the so called doctor

"Let's all beat each other up for tactical mistakes after we've gotten out of these bonds," Ardon suggests as he makes a futile attempt to get free. "What about Kyle, Talon and the other Jedi?" Ardon asks. "We need to warn them."
Ardon concentrates through the Force, trying to single out Kyle and send him a simple message. *Alive. Danger*

Anyways... back to the game.
There's no response from the commlinks as they have been turned off. Though moments later Kyle receives Ardon's telepathic message: *Alive. Danger.*
The captives recover their wits (( if you were resting to regain CT then you are now at -2 steps )), though your arms are still tightly bound behind you.
As Ardon tests his bonds he somehow manages to escape them. The mesh tape which had been wrapped around his wrists begin to come loose and he is able to wiggle free.

Stragos gets up slowly pulling the Mesh tape out of his fur wincing. Walks over to Ardon "Here let me help you with that." popping a claw out to cut the tape. "Mesh tape is not the best way to restrain a Cathar."{ Sulvar smiles a toothy grin. Then winces at the throbbing in his head.

### **Darren** (2009-05-07 22:30:24)

Lucien smiles at Al, "Oh I had no interest in revenge, I have nothing against the Noghri and it's not like they were hurting me until I got involved. Of course they had no interest in running away either, not after they realised that they were actually winning. But I suppose it was too much to hope that you'd have realised that."
Lucien strains against the bonds for a few moments, not really expecting to be able to break them, but it's worth a shot.

Draco had withdrawn further into the cavern disappearing into a dark tunnel. Raik Muun, the half human woman has been bound by Stragos. Apparently taking Draco up on his offer to join him, Ardon had turned and attacked Kyle. He is now bound and being looked after by the Twi'lek rescued earlier.
Thorla "Yes... Apparently he heard about the holocron which was being kept here. Found two of them."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **hayabusa** (2009-05-10 18:20:07)

Ardon sits on the floor of the cavern, bound by his opponents, a half-mad Jedi watching over him. He looks around the room, studying it. He gently tests his bonds, wanting to know what is exactly keeping him from escaping, other than his wounds. He takes several slow breaths, prefering to get his breath naturally rather than risk using the Force with Thorla around.
*They've got me now…* he thinks. *It's execution for sure.*
He considers his options more.

Raik struggles against her bonds. but ultimately gives up. She takes a deep breath, and tries to gather herself. Her serpent like eyes glaring hatred at the twi'lek holding them captive. "This is an outrage! Have all Jedi grown so weak they won't kill they're enemies? no wonder you where beaten by clones!"

Lucien smiles from the sideline and says, in a rather amused tone of voice, "It's actually my fault your still alive actually, the Jedi had nothing to do with it. I patched you up during the battle after you took a particularly nasty blaster wound after you fell unconscious."
Lucien leans the ancient looking sword that he had acquired earlier against the wall before doing so himself so he can be comfortable for her inevitable tirade against him, he actually seems to be looking forward to it.

Raik spit, But slowly the moisture from her lips arched around and hit Stragos in the face. She'd apparently used the Force to cause it to alter course. "Then do it and put me out of my misery!"

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **hayabusa** (2009-05-11 21:17:23)

Ardon watches Stragos with vindication, hearing his words but not the sarcasm in them. Finally, he has proof of what he had feared. The savage beast would just as easily kill them both now rather than take them into custody. Somehow, and someway, he and the other prisoner would have to escape.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-05-12 04:45:32)

Lucien looks at Stragos and says quiet plainly in a tone he hasn't used before it's quieter, and yet it doesn't seem to have any trouble carrying, "I'm only going to say this once, you even think about shooting her again, and you'd better make sure you shoot me first."

### **Avarna** (2009-05-12 08:33:39)

Raik turned and glared at Lucian. It wasn't clear what was going through the Darksider's mind. When she finally spoke, her tone was more subdued but still very dangerous. "So you crave my flesh do you? Very well, come and try to take what you desire."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-05-12 08:52:56)

Lucien smiles and says, "Oh you're very attractive, but that's not it at all." his tone changes and it's pretty obvious he isn't really being completely honest "I put a lot of effort into patching you up I'd hate to see it go to waste."
"You do need to stop thinking that we are going to hurt you. For most of us..." looking pointedly at Stragos and Al as he says this "...it's not an option. Out of curiosity what would you do if you were released?"

---

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Avarna** (2009-05-12 19:09:28)

It was clear by her expression, that Raik didn't believe that was Lucien's interest in her was as simple as that. "Why don't you untie me and find out?" She replied mischievously.

### **Darren** (2009-05-13 06:23:43)

Lucien smiles, and replies in equally mischievous a tone, "It's very tempting, but I wouldn't want to give shoot-first don't bother asking questions here." nodding at Stragos, "A reason to shoot you again." he raises an eyebrow "I'm not entirely sure how he thinks you can prove yourself trustworthy while your tied up though."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Avarna** (2009-05-13 17:47:37)

"Oh, Please. If you haven't killed me yet, Your not going to do it in cold blood." Raik replied, clearly showing her contempt to both the men. "But if It makes you feel better. If you untie me, I won't attack you."

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Vash** (2009-05-13 18:02:41)

Al finely walked over after reloading his grenade launched and making sure the troopers were dead. He looked at Raik and Ardon both tied up and shook his head. "This is one reason I'm glad I don't deal with the force. With as many people that I've killed I'm sure I would be losing it by now." he said eying over Raik trying to decided what to do with her.

Go on... Ardon thinks as he watches the other prisoner waste time. Give us some time to rest and then--when they leave--we'll have our one chance to escape.
Ardon keeps resting, knowing that if even he was partially recovered enough to even make the escape, one simple mistake would mean the end for him.

And as I said before I'm willing to take full responsibility if I happen to be wrong." he looks at Ardon for a moment, "As for the other one, well honestly I think we should leave it up to the Jedi to decide what to do about Ardon here, he is after all one of theirs."

Once Raik is untied, She simple stands up and moves a short distance away from the others. Then she lays down and starts to rest.
((UTF to Enter Force trance))

"I do have to question your judgement Lucien. You did decide to work for the monsters who used me as a lab rat" Sulvar goes over to the troopers and starts searching them to see what he finds.

Lucien seems rather offended by that, "I was most emphatically not working for them, I was just a medical doctor. I never realised that such places still existed."

"They didn't exist until Palpatine became emperor and brought in his "New Order". You were a cog in his machine. You want to trust Raik. She works for Inquisitor Draco. Who I have not seen good things from. You have proven to be a decent man. I just question your judgment when it comes to people. The Emporer has ushered in an age where you need to be very careful who you give your trust to. I have personally experienced what that trust can get you."

Lucien says to Stragos, "I hate to say this my friend, but places like where you were kept existed long before the Empire was formed, they were completely illegal of course, and I'd always thought the Empire had destroyed them when they'd come into power. Clearly that was not the case though. As for trusting to freely normally I don't, but there is just something about her that makes me think we can trust her."

"Well that should tell you what kind of people this "New Order" is." Stragos pigs up one of the blasters and sees if he can peice together a full undamaged set of armor and collects the spare power packs. Stragos mutters to himself "Might come in handy later" Stragos says louder "Lucien you'll understand if trust doesn't come so easily for me. I have had a fairly bad 6 months recently."

Kyle watches Raik unsure as to her intentions. He decides to enter into a healing trance while listen to Lucien talking.

As Raik and Kyle enter Force trances, Ardon relaxes somewhat. Knowing that he needs to rest up to have any sort of opportunity to escape later on, Ardon gets as comfortable as he can and slips into a trance of his own.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **Darren** (2009-05-20 04:52:01)

Lucien relaxes against the wall, his eyes focussed almost entirely on the still form of Raik as she concentrates on her Force Trance, having no intention of going to sleep or resting any time soon.

As most of you bunker down to rest, the ground begins to shake. From the ceiling small pieces of rock come loose, threatening to collapse on you.

Al looked up and sighs **"Oh, look something else is going wrong."** he mutters to himself **"Ok nap time is over kids. time to get moving."** he said checking to see if everyone was moving out. If anyone wasn't moving out Al would movie to carry them out.

Lucien pushes himself off from the wall and heads over to give Raik a hand (which she is obviously going to reject, but he plans to be most insistent) with exiting the facility given how recently she was near death she really shouldn't be moving around much, but it can't really be helped it's a lot less safe to stay here.

Raik swats Lucian's hand away as he attempted to help her, as the near-human woman sat up. "Fool." She says simply before standing up and starting to walk out of the cavern.

Ardon struggles to stand in spite of his bonds, leaning against the wall he was sitting against and straining to rise without using his bound hands. "Please, help me up," he pleads with the others.

Al looks at Ardon "I don't care if you tried to kill us I'm not leaving you behind." he said as he walked over to Ardon and picked him up and looked him in the eyes "Look I know things got a little rough down here. As soon as this is over if you need some time to yourself just tell me where to drop you off." he said meaning every word he said. As he walked he made sure not to hurt Ardon.

Lucien does not seem in the least bit bothered by Raik calling him a fool or slapping away his hand, in fact he seems to find it amusing as he follows her out. He is careful to not let her get out of his sight.

"If he's to weak to save himself, he should have been left behind." Raik speaks aloud, but without seeming to address anyone in particular. Raik couldn't think of herself as a full Sith, however that was simply a matter of common sense to any darksider.

## Re: Echoes of the Jedi

### **hayabusa** (2009-05-27 18:17:52)

Ardon narrows his eyes at the dark Jedi. "We're both lucky they usually don't kill defenseless people. I seem to remember, while I was preoccupied, you being shot at while unconcious and being saved by the medic. You were pretty weak then, you know…"
EDIT: Because orange looks horrible on these new boards.

Lucien smiles at little at the mention of him saving Raik, but doesn't offer any comment of his own.

The next morning Kyle enters the gym to conduct some basic lightsaber training, he starts to warm up until his students arrive.
