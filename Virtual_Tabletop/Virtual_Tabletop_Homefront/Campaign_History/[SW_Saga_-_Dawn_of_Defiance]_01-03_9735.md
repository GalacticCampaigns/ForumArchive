## Session 1 cont.

### **Alicia** (2008-04-06 16:04:06)

The fight against Ganga Lor and his thugs is over, some of you remained in Deep Storage Bay V14 to speak to Switch. From him you've learned that Maya's cargo is in a hanger bay on Blue Deck. Brome was attempting to garner more information from Switch, who insisted on a "meager down payment" of 500 credits, in exchange for access to his information net.
Christiana and Brand are in the hallway.
Here's some of the transcript for starters[hide]Brome walks over to Switch "what type of job?" **
Switch: As you talk u see Switches thugs pick up the dead bodies and toss them down the exhaust shaft
** Ploss talks to switch in the alien language **
Talon Rann: "I guess you can clean up."
Talon Rann: "I have no idea what he just said."
Switch: Looks to Ploss "Simple enough job, Theres a crate of Correlian ale that needs to be delivered to a cantina in Alderaan. I can offer 100 credits now and the recipient will pay 500 upon deliivery."
** Brand watches Christi leave, shaking his head. You can see he shows no emotion or remorse. He's not cold hearted, in fact, seems more disappointed if anything. **
** Brand calls over to Ploss. "We do not have time for that, Ploss. We need to get our cargo and get off this station." **
Brome: "sorry i don't have a ship, i can fly one, but I don't have one"
** Ploss nods his head in agreement **
Ploss: ((you don't know his name))
Brand: Maya said she would provide us a ship.
Switch: (( remember Maya said she had transport of the station ))
** Christiana goes in the hallway and leans herself against the wall trying to calm herself with her exercises in the force. Simple exercises to modify her emotions. **
Talon Rann: "Sounds good. So wheer is thing case of fine drinking stuff at?"
Brand: ((true, myi apologies))
Brand: ((the force told me LOL))
Brome: "well I thnk i can get a ride I'll take the job"
Switch: "why it is with Maya's cargo. I was going to offer her the job, but you are more... impressive."
Brand: [1d8] <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> [2] = (2)
Ploss: (whispering): "whats the name of the cantina?"
GM - Alicia: (whispering): he gives u the name
** Christiana listens in on the conversation in the next room **
Talon Rann: "Glad to hear it." "So we get the hundred and we will be on our way to get the goods."
** Brand raises an eyebrow. "I thought you said that the cargo was in the blue bay and was...quite... something. You used some word." **
Switch: hands Ploss the 100 credits
Switch: (( he didnt say 100 each ))
** Brand shakes his head. "No... her cargo was to go to anothe rplace." **
Talon Rann: "Hey how come he get the credits?"
Switch: (( both cargos are going to alderaan ))
Brome: "you going to give me half that right"
** Ploss takes the credits and says something in Anselmian **
Talon Rann: "Great Is still have no idea what you are saying."
Ploss: (whispering): "thank you"
** Ploss turns to Talon and smiles **
Talon Rann: In Huttees to Ploss. "Can you understand me now."
Switch: "If there's nothing else, there are other matters I must attend to"
Brome: "so whats the cargo?"
** Brand sighs. "I suppose if they are both going to Alderaan, we may as well." **
** Ploss looks at you confused and then heads to go get the cargo **
Switch: If he could smile he would. "Ah, for the meager down payment of 500 credits I could answer that any other questions."
Talon Rann: "Great, this is just great. Well I guess we will be leaving. Later Switch."
Switch: that and any other*
Brome: "someone else can pay him I used all my cash for Mayas cargo"
** Brand shakes his head and leaves the room to join Christi. "Do not mourn the loss of your master. Your sorry will bring you more anger and lead you toward the dark side." He touches her shoulder gently. "Look more to the task at hand and how to honor his memory." **
** Talon Rann Heads for the door. A little upset that there is something that he has to figure into the equation, someone he can communicate with. **
** Christiana looks at Brand and hugs him with her lip curled as she sees him. "I will try and control my emotions, its just hard." **[/hide]

Brand, after suffering an emotional hug from the young female Jedi, takes a moment to consider her actions and shakes off the feelings of actually being a man. He gives her a comforting touch to her shoulder after gently pulling away, then moves to kneel meditatively in the hallway, facing the door.
He watches the interactions inside the room in quiet consideration, remembering his training in patience and understanding, the whole time finding himself wishing the rest of the members of his makeshift group would remember that the Empire is more than likely searching for them and they need to still retrieve their cargo from the bay on Blue Deck.

Kyle leaves to join the other Jedi in the hall. "Hi we never really got a chance to introduce ourselves, I am Kyle Qe-Droma, my Master was Alic Sunter."

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-07 19:39:33)

Brand stands up, hands still hidden inside the sleeves of his robe like the monks of the ancient order of Bendu. With the incline of his head, he returns the greeting and introduction that Kyle gave.
"I am Bran Kel-Jorik, former Padawan to Kerrick Sol Amon. It's good that we have managed to come together... I feel it is the will of the Force. Though, I fear it is also dangerous."

---

## Re: [Saga] Dawn of Defiance: Out of Session PbP

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-08 10:17:39)

"Dangerous it maybe but there is safety in numbers. Have you got a a feal on the other strays we picked up?"
Thinking to himself. Kyle glances at Christi curious about her emotion out burt, but these are hard times. Though we are Jedi we are not knights or masters.
"I think we should learn to use more conventional weapons unless our Lightsabers are neccessary." Glancing at both.

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-08 12:50:59)

((I hate to post again already, but no one else is posting LOL I feel like I'm taking up all the play time... good thing this is PbP.))
Brand nods slightly, also glancing at Christi. He remains motionless otherwise, except for slight eye movements. "Safety in numbers indeed, though ripples of our connection to the force continue to increase the chances of our being discovered."
His chin moves, looking over Kyle's shoulder into the room with the rest of his companions. "As for the others, I have great confidence in Brome. His head is on straight and he seems knowledgable. Unfortunately our Nautolan friend appears hostile toward humans and somewhat distant to us. And Talon... I haven't gotten a very good sense of him yet. I am not dissatisfied with with any of this yet. I am more worried about what it is Maya wants us to take to Alderaan for her. We will need to examine it and find out what exactly it is we're doing."

## Re: [Saga] Dawn of Defiance: Out of Session PbP

### **ganthet** (2008-04-08 13:00:07)

Talon walks out of the room hand over his wound and farily confident that he has learned everything he can here. "Man Forgot how much that stings." Talon looks at the, well he quesses they are Jedi, standing in the hallway. "So whats the plan heal up and go find the cargo and get off this floating trash compactor?"

---

## Re: [Saga] Dawn of Defiance: Out of Session PbP

### **Alicia** (2008-04-08 13:16:21)

Switch after a few moments says, "Since you did assist me in taking care of Ganga Lor allow me to call in a favor to Dr Byra Fenn. She is the chief doctor at Delgas Medical Supplies located on the Promenade and will be able to get you in top condition free of charge. As for the cargo, I'm willing to tell you that it is in fact a man frozen in carbonite and it came from the Deep Core. The Empress Teta to be precise, he must have done it to lower the risk of him being found out."

---

## Re: [Saga] Dawn of Defiance: Out of Session PbP

### **ganthet** (2008-04-08 13:56:35)

"Well that would be great there Switch." "Give him a call we will wait right here." Talon finds a spot up agianst one of the creats in Switch ware house hideout. "So let me get this striaght the package you want us to get in a man frozen in carbonite?"

---

## Re: [Saga] Dawn of Defiance: Out of Session PbP

### **Alicia** (2008-04-08 14:01:37)

"Maya is the one who wants you to get it, and yes it's a man frozen in carbonite." Switch moves closer to his desk and contacts the physician. After a few minutes of quiet conversations the connection is disabled and he addresses everyone in the room. "She is readying her equipment for your arrival."
((Don't feel bad about posting so soon. If you wish to converse with someone then by all means do so.))

## Re: [Saga] Dawn of Defiance: Out of Session PbP

### **thelastfool** (2008-04-08 14:47:20)

Ploss has left the rest of the group and is making his way over to the Blue Deck to get the cargo. Thinking to himself *Damn humans. Every time they're around something bad happens…. to make matters worse some of them are jedi… but i have no choice i was running low on funds for travel and food… i guess i'll go with them for a while. but if that one treats me like a pet again, they're losing the hand. Now which one was it… I can't tell one human from the other. I'll worry about that later.* as he continues his search for the cargo.

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-08 17:20:54)

Brand falls silent, nodding when he's finally given instruction to go to the physician to heal up. He needs it himself, having taken quite a few grazes and a decent shot to his shoulder, which could be a good reason why he had trouble keeping his lightsaber powered during the combat. Time to get that fixed. He motions for everyone to come with him, letting Talon lead the way since he seems to have the link to the map of the station.
Seeing Ploss head off in a different direction, however, he shakes his head slightly, his confidence in that companion beginning to fail a little. "Does anyone know where he is going?"

### **ganthet** (2008-04-09 10:39:35)

"Him? If I had to guess I would say back the way we came. Maybe he thinks he can handle it on his own. I don't know." Talon sets on the creates waiting for the doctor to show up. "One of us could try and head him off and get him to wait for the rest of us to get there." "Any of you got a data pad, I could give you the map I have and I would head him off." Talon looks up at Switch. "Where is this Doctor at? Could you show me?"
Talon pulls out his data pad and gets ready to recive the info form Switch.

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Alicia** (2008-04-09 10:59:25)

"Certaintly" He points to a location on the datapad. "It's called 'Delgas Medical Supplies.' A corporate medical and pharmaceutical supplier. Dr Byra Fenn is again the one who will be taking care of you. Very talented woman."

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-09 11:07:19)

Brand nods to Talon, already starting to head toward the Medical Supply station. With a dismissing wave of his hand, he says quietly, "Our non-human friend can find his way, I think. Hopefully he doesn't run into any trouble, it will be difficult to assist him without us nearby." He almost seems annoyed that one of the group members is just going off on his own, but only because he feels their safety is in jeopardy due to the combat not just a few hours earlier. The nature of the Nautolan's appearance alone would make him an easy target to identify.
((I vote we skip ahead to the Delgas Medical Supply station.))

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **ganthet** (2008-04-09 11:46:51)

"Thank you Switch." Talon heads for the med station. "We should at least send someone to make sure he does blow this for the rest of use." Talon looks over his shoulder to the others. "I mean if he gets there frist, and goes ahead and trys to get the cargo himself and fails they will know that it is of interest and will either move it or wait and see who else shows up to try and get it." Talon is just trying to get them to see reason on this. He is also worried he has gone throw all this trouble and won't get paid.

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-09 16:21:57)

((I second that vote))
"I hope this won't take long, we should get this cargo and deliver it staying in one place to long invites trouble in my humble opinion."" Kyle glances about while walking with the group.

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Vash** (2008-04-09 19:02:41)

Brome looked at his credit chip "Hum 45 creds....guess I'm not getting that new blaster after all, should have taking that 500. Oh well, sorry Switch I'm broke" he said as he walked out of the room. He stopped and looked at the thugs that the others had killed "I'm sorry I couldn't save you" he said as he looked down.
He took a deep breath and put a smile on as he walked out of the room "Ok guys lets get out of here" he said with his normal big smile "I'm tired of this joint and I want to go rest up a bit"

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Alicia** (2008-04-10 17:41:32)

**Everyone but Ploss:**
[hide]Too tired and hurt to go after Ploss, everyone takes up Switch on his offer to call in a favor to a doctor located on the Promenade. Taking the safest yet quickest route there, you all arrive uneventfully.
The medical supplier is a small shop and there is an assortment of medical supplies on display to be purchased. When you enter a tall woman stands just behind a counter.
Taking in your appearances, she says "May I help you?"[/hide]
**For Ploss:**
[hide]As the turbolift doors slide open and you step out onto Blue Deck, it is like entering a wholly different space station. The floors are polished and possess a metallic sheen, and the massive windows along one wall grant the most magnificent view of Brentaal available on the station. Maintenance and service droids flit about from one place to the next, keeping everything clean and ordered.
Moving about the halls of Blue Deck are large numbers of Humans, most of them wealthy by all appearances. They pay little attention to the few aliens found in the area, except, perhaps, to sneer as they pass.
As you walk along the halls, you overhear two nobles talking about the squad of Stormtroopers who were sent to a cargo bay to check out some suspicious cargo.[/hide]

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-11 09:08:57)

Brand approaches the woman, one hand resting in the palm of the other, bowing his head in greeting. "We were told to come here by a droid named Switch. Due to unfortunate circumstances, we suffered some injuries in providing service to the Droid."
He then looks around, pursing his lips while taking in all the possible supplies he may need while here.

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Vash** (2008-04-11 09:51:31)

Brome slowly walked up "Hi there lady, do you think you'll be able to help us out. I got shot a few times and I'm sure that some of my friends here got hurt to" he said in a friendly carefree tone. As he walked up he noticed Brand "Oh...guess you were one step ahead of me" he said with a small laugh. He walked up to Brand and looked around watching for any more Stormtroopers.

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Alicia** (2008-04-11 10:25:04)

The woman nods, "I have been expecting you. I am Dr. Byra Fenn. If you would come this way I can get you taken care of." She motions to the back of the store. Please make yourselves comfortable."
The back of the store is divided into two rooms. One room with a caged door holds extra medical inventory. The other room is a small medical room with a waiting area. A curtain sits on one end in preparation to cut across the room.
Once everyone is in she says,
"Who would like to be first?"
((I will go ahead and do the calculations to see how long it will take to get everyone RPing to full (since Noelle hasn't been participating and I don't know her character I'll just have her heal in a trance), and by mutual consent we can skip ahead. Till then feel free to RP.))

### **Vash** (2008-04-11 20:00:37)

Brome looked at the others and stepped forward "Well I guess I'm first. Try not hurt me too much" he said as he looked at the waiting area. He took his jet pack and cloak off and set them on the ground "Ok where to Doc?"

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **thelastfool** (2008-04-11 20:45:22)

[hide]Ploss sighs... and turns around to head back. *I guess I'll need them to get the stuff after all. There's too many of these weird looking creatures around. Plus I might need help getting rid of the Stormtroopers.*[/hide]

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Alicia** (2008-04-11 20:49:15)

Byra motions for Brome to lay on the med bed, applying first aid she takes care of most of the injuries before pulling out her surgical tools. She cuts off view with the curtain and gets to work.
Once done with Brome she pulls aside the curtain and indicates for the next person to step up.

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **ganthet** (2008-04-11 23:22:30)

Talon who has been holding hias wound all the way here, jumps up. "I will go next." He says. "After this I will head to see if our friend is still alive and hopefully waiting for us." Talon lays down on the med table and lets the Doctor do here work.

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Alicia** (2008-04-12 00:04:59)

Once Talon steps beyond the curtain she closes it and prepares to perform surgery on Talon. After a couple hours, Talon emerges completely healed.
"Please give me a few moments, I must check on the store. There's some food and drink in that cabinet if you would like to help yourselves." Leaving a medical droid to clean up she heads into the store front.

Christiana follows her jedi friend and listens quietly about the medical bay. She follows the party members as they head up and tries to get herself healed as well before going to the Blue Deck.

## Session 2 cont

### **Alicia** (2008-04-12 23:25:54)

[hide](9348) Christiana: "Im sorry"
(9358) Talon Rann: "Well we need to get moving. So we will leave you to it."
** (9392) Ploss lifts up his glass "Sure sounds like it" **
** (9356) Brome gets he gear on and gets ready as he checks his jet pack and pistols **
(9348) Christiana: "Can the droid do it, because I need to go with my friends soon"
(9317) Capt. Okeefe: "There should be enough food and water on board for about a week. Feel free to take some of it with you."
(9317) Capt. Okeefe: "He has more important things to do. and its ur mess."
** (9358) Talon Rann grabs a field kit and the binocs and heads out of the ship to have a look around." **
(9348) Christiana: "fine" she uses the force power surge to get it done in a jiffy
(9317) Capt. Okeefe: The droid moves out of t cockpit, beeping in binart all the while.
** (9215) Brand waits until Christi has finished clearning, then admonishes her, saying in a quiet, calm voice. "THe Force should only be used accurately... AND only when necessary. REmember?" **
(9215) Brand: "In fact, before you went rushing off to do this thing, I was going to just tell you, I think we should very very carefully watch how we use it here. We have no idea who is on the planet with us."
** (9348) Christiana looks at her cleaned up mess and nods, "But arent we as Jedi supposed to live in the force and use it as our ally?" **
(9348) Christiana: "For without the force what power do we have as trained in the ways of the force"
** (9215) Brand leads Chrisiti outside to join the others. "We must live in harmony with the Force. Using it recklessly and needlessly is not haromnious. The Force is to be used for knowledge and understanding.. and in times of need." **
(9317) Capt. Okeefe: Your first steps onto the soil of Felucia make it clear that this planet is truly alive. Massive mushrooms tower overhead, their overhanging edges creating a canopy that blocks out much of the planets sunlight. Every step on Felucian soil turns up insects and other fungi just beneath the surface. The noise of the jungle is loud and alien, full of the sounds of a hundred insects and animals moving through the mushroom swamps, all part of a living and vibrant ecosystem.
(9215) Brand: "However... our enemies also use the Force and can sense when we do it as well. We must be careful in our use of it."
** (9358) Talon Rann looks at Brand. **
** (9356) Brome looks around "wow now this is a vacation" **
(9317) GM - Alicia: guys this is a good place to call
(9358) Talon Rann: "If you are done lectureing the poor girl Brand. We have got 12 hrs of hiking to do."
(9317) GM - Alicia: i dont want to go too far without Kyle getting involved
** (9215) Brand looks around as he and Christi join the party, curious about his new surroundings. "This is why," he continues instructing Christi, "Meditating inward and sensing is harmonious, it does not change the environment around us. There are rules of physics, however, that can be broken with the Force, and breaking those rules defies harmony." **[/hide]
After successfully landing on the planet Felucia, you all are preparing to make the journey to the prison complex.

"Brand this is a conversation for another time." Looking a Christi while saying this. Just glad to be fully healed again. "We do need to talk after the mission about this."

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-13 12:21:22)

Brand hefts his backpack and slings it over his shoulder, wrapping his cloak more tightly around him. "This conversation cannot wait, because the careless use of the Force could jeopardize the mission. I think she understands now, however." And without another word, he moves forward, footsteps silenced by the cusion-like surface of the forest, a look of serious determination crossing his features.

Talon walking to the side of the group trying to keep an eye out for the nastys that where mentioned. He trys to keep alittle ways ahead of the group so if anything comes at them the rest can run and find cover. " I hope this is uneventfull. I don't particaly care to have to fight off the planet at the same time I am fighting Stromtroopers." He stops for a second to get his bearings and to have a look around with the binocs.
(OCC trying to keep us on track as dest I can and also keep an eye out for the nasty on the planet. Talon will take number 1.)

### **Alicia** (2008-04-14 16:14:15)

With Kyle taking point and Talon assisting him, after a few hours of travel Talon is so occupied with finding his next marker he steps in what first appeared to be a pool of standing water.
((Talon takes 3 damage and will continue to take 1d6 of damage, unless the acid is taken care of))

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-14 16:21:44)

Brand quickly helps pull Talon out of the acid trap (?) ... while doing so, searching his feelings, trying to get a sense of the consequences of staying in this area while taking care of Talon. Unsure, he begins to wonder if the acid might be some sort of hunting trick of one of the strange animals on this planet. He readies himself, hand on his lightsaber. "Pour water on his leg.." He suggests, eyes looking around the area.
((UTF, search feelings and sense surroundings))

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Alicia** (2008-04-14 16:24:46)

The pool is natural to the environment. You all have passed countless pools on the way here. He was just unlucky enough to step in one at that moment. Other than the chance of someone stepping in this pool this area is safe.

Brand seems to relax, breathing easier as me moves to help wash off the acid from Talon's leg. "We'll have to watch more carefully. These pools of acid look painful," he states the obvious.
((From now on, as we move forward, I will take swift actions to sense sourroudings, looking to make sure we don't step in any pools))

Christiana sees the pool and watches as they wipe the acid off of the man's leg. She looks about as she climbs up one of the mushrooms to look about. "Maybe we can use these mushrooms in someway to avoid the pools of acid. Using the force I can maybe jump from one mushroom to the next to avoid the pools."

Brand agrees with Kyle. "It's a good thought, Christi, but like he said, patrols would see you. Not all of us can jump from mushroom to mushroom... and I'm afraid that would be another use of the Force that would alert our enemies.
"It was a good thought though."
He raises one hand to help her down.

Christiana climbs down from the mushroom with Brand's help and continues to follow Brand though the swamp infested jungle. Stopping here and there to admire the beauty of the wildlife and forests, "The wildlife and the forests are beautiful, far more beautiful than any city. When you see a jungle like this you can feel the force teeming with life all around even in a swamp like this which is quite soothing. In the city, most of the wildlife has been cut away and killed to make room for man made objects. Why can't man use nature to their benefit and not man made objects with materials that aren't very recyclable. Man and other species could learn alot from the planet Zonama Sekot where the inhabitants use wildlife and nature to make living starships that are so full of life a vigor." She frowns sadly, "In conclusion I believe that nature is better than man made."

"Master Skywalker found it when he was a boy.

She frowns as she thinks about her Quarren master. "I blame the emperor mostly for filling falsehoods through the chosen one's head. Will Master Skywalker ever bring balance to the force. It seems he is bringing balance right now by killing all of the force users but I'm not so sure." She continues to walk among the other jedi and the soldiers.

After a few more hours of travel, you stop to take a break. Arriving in a small clearing the landscape is covered with knee deep water ((it is indeed water, not acid)) and littered with small islands of land. You all are surprised to find on one of the islands an effigy dressed in scout trooper armor.

"Frac! That hurts!" Talon calls out in pain as Klye grabs him and pulls him out. "This planet will try to bork you anyway it can won't it." As the acid is washed, Talon looks around alittle. "I guess I will have to pay more attention where I step from now on."
After they are up and moving agian Talon sees the clean pools of water and the islands. "Now there is something interesting." Pointing at the Scout armor that has been left there. "I wonder how left that there?"

"I see the Empire is still being successfull with the winning of hearst and minds." Talon says with a laugh. "The only reason they havn't tak'in it down is because they don't want to get eat'in by the local wild life." Talon finds a nice place to set down and rest. Drinking from his canteen. " I think we should rest for a bit and then get moving."

((Here's how I'm going to run combat. Everyone will be given time to post for the round, you don't have to post in order, but please don't be waiting to see what everyone else will be doing. As we won't get anywhere. If after a day or two not everyone has posted I will take actions for you. My goal is to do a round everyday.))
Initiative count:
Brome - UC, spent 2nd wind
Kyle - UC
Speeder - 1 left
Talon - mounted
Ploss
Brand
Christiana - mounted
ST Recruit - 3 left
We are now starting Round 6
Talon has just arrived on his Kybuck so he is the furthest from the action starting near the top right corner. [Here&#39;s the map for general reference.](http://dod.swrpgrc.com/images/maps/A1/part_2/watch_outpost.jpg "http://dod.swrpgrc.com/images/maps/A1/part_2/watch_outpost.jpg") Kybucks have a speed of 12sqs. The water is difficult terrain (costing x2), and though the mushrooms can be used for cover they can also be destroyed.
You can quickly dismount as a swift action with a DC10 Ride check, or get off safely as a move action.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2 Stormtroopers have left the cover of the base of the bottom left and will be attacking the party. One has remained behind the comm relay in the bottom left corner
1 scout trooper on a Speederbike still rides around firing on anyone in range.
Brand, Christi and Ploss have engaged the Stormtroopers.
Talon is closest as of the end of the round 5 to the scout trooper

Bit of transcript to get you going.
[hide]GM - Alicia: Inside you see three humans. Two are young men and the third is a slightly overweight man with close-cropped gray hair and a bushy mustache. He has clearly seen better days; his right eye is swollen and bruised, and a trail of dried blood stains the corner of his mouth.
Ploss: "So we don't know who we are here to get?"
GM - Alicia: THey look quisically at all of you
** Brand patiently walks into the prison common area. "We're here to set you all free. Which one of you is an admiral?" **
Man: "Admiral?"

Talon Rann: "Cool, you come with us. The rest are free to go."
** Man seems very interested. "Senator Organa sent you?" **
Brome: "Wait whats your name?"
Talon Rann: Ya, we need to get moving."
Brand: "Yes, we must move quickly. What is your name, Admiral?"
Man: The other prisoners jump up and head toward the door searching the bodies for any weapons
Varth: "Gilder Varth"
Talon Rann: "Hope you got those blaster packs i asked for guys.'
** Brand gives a slight whistle and tosses a pistol to one of them." **
Brand: ((Varth is our target, yes?))
Varth: (( yes ))

Talon Rann: "Well If you want a ride out of here Admirial we need to go now."
** Brome nods **
GM - Alicia: go ahead and level up

GM - Alicia: THe prisoners head for the front door
Talon Rann: "Hey guys Going that way will get you killed."

** Brand begins to lead them toward the "rear exit" **
GM - Alicia: "How are we supposed to leave then?"
Brand: No, they are vicitms of the Empire,we'll save them too.
Brand: "Follow us."
Talon Rann: "We take them with us. Lets Get back to the ship."
Brome: W"We nned to blow this place to hell"
** Brome pulls out the explosive he was given **
GM - Alicia: The prisoners follow you Brand
Brand: "right.. you set the charges, I'll get Kyle and Christi and get out of here."
Brand: "with the prisoners and teh admiral."
Talon Rann: "What about the other people trapped in this place? We can't kill them."
Brand: "Check the compures, see if there's any more and if there is a way to release them... we can't worry about them too much. Otherwise we'll run the risk of losing teh Admiral."[/hide]

### **Alicia** (2008-05-04 11:56:31)

Bit of transcript to get started.
[hide]GM - Alicia: Crawl: STAR WARS: DAWN OF DEFIANCE
Episode II
A WRETCHED HIVE
Between the stars in the blackness of space, the Nebulon-B frigate Resurgence floats silently away from the prying eyes of the Empire.
Meanwhile, the galaxy continues to sink further into darkness. Each day, remnants of the Old Republic are crushed and a New Order is more firmly established.
Former Imperial Admiral Gilder Varth has provided Alderaanian agents with vital information on secret projects, and even now events are in motion to reveal the Empires misdeeds to the galaxy . . .
GM - Alicia: You all have been summoned to the main confernce room.
** Ardon Ardon walks towards the conference room, civilian clothes replacing the prisoner jumpsuit that he wore when he first arrived on the ship. **
** Ploss heads to the conference room **
** Brome follows **
GM - Alicia: Everyone heading to the confernce room?
** Brand does of course **
** Ardon nods. **
GM - Alicia: The briefing room aboard the Resurgence is clean and white, with several benches wrapping smoothly around a holographic projector seated on a raised dais in the center of the room. The projector springs to life, and the blue-tinted hologram of a Hutt appears to hover a few inches away from the projectorâ€™s three curved prongs.
With a brusque clearing of his throat, former Imperial officer GilderVarth begins to speak, wasting little time on pleasantries.â€œBefore the Empire decided my conscience was a liability,â€ he says, â€œI was involved peripherally in a top-secret plan known as the Sarlacc Project. While the details of the project are unknown to me, I was involved in the transfer of large sums of credits and resources to the project. Whatever the project entails, it is taking up a lot of the Empireâ€™s time and effort. Moreover, I believe that this Sarlacc Project is destroying the lives of thousands of sentient beings; casualty reports crossed my desk on a regular basis.
â€œUnfortunately, I donâ€™t know much more than that. However, during my brief brushes with the project, I discovered that the Imperial Navy was hiding the programâ€™s existence from the Senate by transferring resources through secondary sources. Resources were routed through the Corporate Sector, through fake contractors, and through the criminal underworld to keep a trail from leading back to the project.
â€œOne such secondary source was a Hutt crime lord named Darga. Like all Hutts, Darga is a slimy gangster whose love of credits is exceeded only by his love of power. Part of my job involved transferring resources to Darga, and in turn arranging for Imperial agents to take control of other resources from the Huttâ€™s organization. These were not simply transfers of credits. The items being traded were not specified, but physical resources were definitely being exchanged. Though itâ€™s not much, this is the only lead we have.
â€œCaptain Verana has charged me with helping to uncover more about the Sarlacc Project, and he has authorized me to use you as my agents. We need you to travel to the planet of Cato Neimoidia and find Darga the Hutt. See if you can learn what he is trading in and how it relates to the Sarlacc Project.â€
Varth: "ANy questios?"
Brome: "Yeah I need to get a few things it there ant place to buy supplies?"
Ploss: "Whats a Hutt?"
Ardon: "Is this how the Senate stays out of it?" Ardon says. "Black budgets?"
Varth: "I'm sure Capt Verana will be able to assist in that."
Brome: "A really big slug with arms"
Varth: ^ to Ploss
Ploss: "Okay..."
** Brand stands up, having shed his own jedi robes now himself. "I have no questions. Only how do we get there." **
Varth: to Brome "I'm sure Capt Verana will be able to assist in that."
** Varth indicates the hologram "THis is Hutt" **
** Brome gets up "Ok where the Capt?" **
** Ploss gets up **
Varth: "The senate most likely does not know about this project. It has been strictly the Emperor's doing. THe Senate is slowly becoming more and more obsolete as the Emporer consoladates his power."
Varth: "Capt Okeefe will be taking you the city of Zarra on Cato Neimodia, which is the most likely location of the Hutt."
Brome: "Ok well im head out to rest and get ready then"
Varth: "Any other questions?"

The trip to Cato Neimoidia is uneventful. Captain Okeefe at some point of the trip shares with you the Imperial Holonet Galactic News she had picked up while on the Resurgence and makes fun at the "Terroist Attack on Felucia" article. ((Which can be found on the website if you wish to read it yourself))
Remember you guys came to Cato Neimodia to locate and question Darga the Hutt.

It is possibly one of their oldest and wealthiest colony worlds, that is until the clone wars.

Talon checks over the Med kits he found at at the Imperial base. He gets one ready for when they leave. *"I can't belive that we haven't picked up a medic in all this time but I quess I will have to do.* He thinks to himself. Figuring that his skillls with a blaster was need more then any medical knowlegde he had came acrossed. After he is finished with the med pack and other gear, he heads to the lounge to see if his friends are ready to leave.

Ardon sits on his bunk inside of the Baudo yacht, deep in meditation as the journey to Cato Neimodia continues. There were Jedi assigned to the planet in the later stages of the war, he knew, in an attempt to take the Neimoidian purse world from Seperatist hands. Perhaps, he dares to think, a Jedi master--maybe even a council member--has survived as well. Shrugging his lekku in a "yeah, right" gesture, the Twi'lek enters a state of meditation.

The days on the ship pass quickly as you all make last minute preparations.
When the Banshee drops out of hyperspace, any heroes in the cockpit can see that there is very little traffic traveling to and from the world. As the Banshee descends toward the planet, the ship flies through layers of clouds and zooms over cities that are built on massive bridges between rock arches. However, the bridge cities are all but abandoned, seemingly left to rot after the Clone Wars. Landing on Cato Neimoidia with no difficulty, you find there is no visible Imperial presence. The Banshee docks at a spaceport in the city of Zarra, and though propaganda posters line the spaceport walls, there is no sign of stormtroopers or other Imperial officials.
Okeefe does however warn you not to act foolishly or the Empire's attention may be drawn to you, and more importantly, to her.
Making your way off of the ship you all wander into the city of Zarra. Zarra itself is dilapidated to the point of being hazardous. As you walk the streets, you see little in the way of authority or commerce. Several large buildings appear to have been lavish palaces of Neimoidian merchants lie half toppled and mostly destroyed. Rubble litters the streets, and landspeeders must veer sharply to avoid chunks of permacrete lying haphazardly in the road. Though a number of beings, mostly shabby-looking Neimoidians, roam the streets, it is clear that Zarra has been nearly abandoned since the Clone Wars.

Talon looks around at the wreck the city has become. "I can't belive the they would just abandon all of this and let it rot." He ajusts the med kit on his back and keeps one hand close to his blaster. " The Trade Federation hass alot to answer for on this world." Talon can't help but think about what is happening on Corillia right now, the Empire could leave his beloved home in ruins just like this. "Well what do we do know guys?" Talon looks at his friends wondering if they know where to start.

Current status
[hide]Ardon 26hp (remember to subtract 600 credits for the treatment)
Brand 33
Brome 47
Kyle 28
Ploss 53
Talon 21
Raia 18[/hide]
After locating Warrick Raden and fighting his Thugs; Brome, Brand, Raia, and Talon head back to the clinic in Raden's speeder (also with him in tow) where they had left Kyle and Ardon. Finding they had moved off to a nearby cheap motel to meditate. Everyone is now reunited.
There is barely enough room for everyone in the speeder and half you end having to sit on the others to fit. Raden directs Raia to Darga's hideout.
As you approach Dargaâ€™s palace, you see that it is cleverly hidden among the ruins of several destroyed Neimoidian palaces. In fact, on first approach, there seems to be nothing of importance in the area. But on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the Huttâ€™s palace is cobbled together from former Neimoidian estates. The entrance to the palace is a pair of massive blast doors, 5 meters tall and carved with elaborate Hutt runes, set into the front wall. The doors appear to be unguarded.
Getting out of the speeder, Raden walks timidly up to one door, which has a small communications panel. He presses a button, sputters some phrases in Huttese (â€œThis is Raden. Iâ€™ve come to deliver news to the mighty Darga. With all due respect, I require an audience.â€), and steps back, fidgeting nervously. A long, quiet moment passes before two Nikto with hunting blaster rifles appear on battlements above the doors, weapons at the ready and pointed down at the visitors. A metal panel in the blast door scrapes as it is pulled aside, and a pair of glowing red eyes appear in the slit. A gravelly voice echoes from within the doors, again in Huttese (â€œYouâ€™re in for it now, Raden. Darga is expecting visitors, all right, but those creatures are not them.â€), and the panel slams closed. A moment later, there is a heavy clank of metal on metal, and the blast doors part to either side. A rush of cold, dry air flows outward from the Huttâ€™s palace, and Raden motions you to follow him inside.
Entering the palace, there is no sign of who or what might have owned the glowing red eyes seen through the door panel. You follow Raden down a long, dark hallway illuminated at seemingly random intervals by torches set in sconces on the walls. Anyone passing through this hallway feels that something is watching them from the darkness. Unmarked metal doors are set into the walls at various points, and the air is thick with the smell of dust and rotting wood. Moving deeper into the palace, you get the sense that the building was once bright and beautiful.
Talon only
[hide]You can tell that much of the architecture and trim is Neimoidian in design, and it becomes clear that the palace probably once belonged to a high-ranking member of the Trade Federation, perhaps an advisor to Nute Gunray.[/hide]
Eventually, Raden leads you toward the soft sound of music and voices, which come from the Huttâ€™s throne room. Dargaâ€™s throne room is both opulent and repulsive. A thick layer of oddly scented smoke drifts through the air, rising out of braziers in the corners of the room. Once-beautiful tapestries line the walls, though most of them have been torn, burned, or stained to the point that they are almost unrecognizable. A raised dais in the center of the room supports the massive bulk of Darga the Hutt, and behind his dais a large, open balcony seems to extend into darkness. Scattered through out the room are members of Darga's court.
Upon entering, the sounds of conversation and music come to a halt. Silence reigns as every eye turns to watch Raden lead you into an open space in front of the opulent dais. Darga's eyes roll from the heroes to Raden, then sharpen quickly with anger. He booms something in Huttese at the Devaronian (â€œWhat is the meaning of bringing outsiders here?â€), who immediately begins groveling, begging for the Huttâ€™s forgiveness as the rest of the court hoots with laughter and derision. Darga cuts him off with a harsh word (â€œSilence!â€) and calls for his protocol droid, TC-663. From this point on, Darga begins addressing you directly, using TC-663 as a translator.
"What is it that you want?"

"Your Emance." Talon says bowing. "We seek information. Informaton only you can give us." Talon looks around at his friends. "We would like to aquire materials for our employer. We have heard that you can get them for him descreatly. He is willing to pay of course." Talon has dealt with Darga's type before Hutts are interested in money and power and will sale out family to get both.

Brand steps forward, respectfully bowing his head. "Great Darga, I am Brand Kel-Jorrik, former liason for the republic. While our proposition does not immediately interest you now, the relations you establish with our employer now may very well prove to be extremely profitable for you in the future." He bows again, a little deeper this time. "Does the idea of increasing your wealth and power not interest you?"

---

## Re: Traitor's Gambit, Wretched Hive, Queen of Air and Darkne

### **Alicia** (2008-05-11 22:03:19)

Considers Brand for a moment then gives a hearty laugh. "You are persistant, I admire that quality. Come join my court for a short while, I have many matters to attend to and expecting important visitors."
He turns to the rest of his court and yells in Huttese. ("Prepare the feast!") The throne room bursts into hubbub of activity as servants and other supposedly low ranking members of the court bring out tables and chairs, and soon food.
"Join me as my guests and we will discuss this arrangement further."
The food set on the table is delicious and very expensive. And as the feast begins you all see Raden being dragged away by two of the Gammorean guards.
When all of you are settled he asks (with the protocol droid TC-663 interpreting for you).
"Now, tell me who you are?"

"I don't trust the hutts further than I can throw them." Glancing at Darga. "And that is saying a lot, and I'm sure Talon would agree." Then looking back to everyone. "I have a feeling these guests he's waiting on has something to do with what we're here for too."

Talon specks so only Kyle and the other can hear. "The Hutts gangsters. They grow fat off the suffering of others. Size, wealth and power are all the crave and they will stop at nothing to get it." Talon looks around around to see if anyone else is listening. "It is kind of a culture thing to them, the bigger you are the more money and power you have makes you higher up on there social ladder. They will betray you in a heart beat if there is credits in it for them."
Talon looks around at all the preperation that are being made. "I suggest that me and Brand do the talking we seem to have alot of experance with Dargas kind." "One miss step and this could get ugly fast." Talon hopes his friends understand the graveness of the situation. He would not like any of them to windup as salves to this Hutt.

"Be wary of any numbers he may give us," Ardon whispers to the rest of the group as they wait for the feast to be prepared. "I've heard rumors that Hutts use a different system of counting than most other humanoids do."
***Later, when the rest of the party is introducing themselves***
"My apologies, Exalted Darga, for not introducing myself sooner. My name is Ardo'niloet, and I would like to thank you for you granting us an audience."

"And I was also wondering what services we can help someone of your importance with?"

## Session 7 cont...

### **Alicia** (2008-05-18 15:26:15)

((Transcript is up))
After the feast, Darga brought Raden before all of you and ordered that he was to be executed. Brome had volunteered but instead of killing the helpless Deveranian, he merely stunned him. Darga who had been thrilled by the spectacle didn't even realize what Brome had done. Following the "execution", Iron Ring slavers arrived announced and an argument erupted between Darga and the slavers Zabrak leader. IT only ended when Brand spotted one of the slaves sip something into Darga's wine goblet carried by a servant. The slavers retreated from an outraged Darga's audience chamber. Given rooms to stay in the converted servant's quarters, the party relaxed for the night making a venture out to explore Darga's palace. THey meet Darga's moneychanger Grome, but after several failed attempts by Ardon to get him to leave the room to poke around the party retreated back to their quarters for the night.
The next day, Darga invited the party to participate in the gladiatorial arena. Accepting on the condition stun weapons be used the entered. What followed was a difficult battle against a droid, three Gamorrean brothers and a Rodian. Everyone except Raia (and KYle who didn't participate) was knocked unconscious and woke back in their rooms. Brome left to find Darga, only to find Demos instead and was able to get a pair of doctors to come and aid the party.
After 10 hours of work, everyone but Brand is back to full health with Brand requiring 7 more hours. It is late evening on the planet and everyone is still in the guest quarters.

Late that night there's a knock on all of your doors, waking most of you from sleep. Waiting in the hall is a Neimoidian servant, who looks at all of you nervously.
"Pardon me sirs," he says. "but I was sent to tell you Darga has summoned you to a secret meeting in the Aviary. If you would follow me I'll take you to him."

"Thank you very much," Ardon says as the Neimoidian gives him the summons. "Let me get dressed first, though." Letting the door shut on its own, Ardon changes from his sleep clothes into his typical uniform. Packing his blaster pistol and borrowed lightsaber just in case it turns as ugly as he thinks it might, he heads out the door and goes with the others to the aviary.

"Of course, I will come." Talon looks around to see if any of the others have been called to the meeting. "Just let me grab my gear and I will be right behind you." Talon quickly get dressed and grabs his gear and heads out into the hall way to follow the servent to the where the meeting will take place. He finishes straping on his gunbelt and making sure he has his medkit ready just incase. "This must be important if he is calling for us at this hour?" Talon trys to get alittle information out of the man before they head down. "Can you tell me what this is about?"

### **Alicia** (2008-05-21 10:40:18)

The servant nervously replies, "Im afraid I wasn't told why he wants to see you. Just that he did." You do get the sense from the way the servant acts that he is always afraid.
Once everyone is ready, the Neimoidian servant leads you out of the guest quarters and to an upper level of the palace. Once there, he points to a set of sliding double doors and says that Darga waits inside.
Walking through the doors you enter the aviary. The interior of the aviary is quiet, and rising up from either side of a winding path are numerous trees, each with many colorful birds sleeping while perched on their branches. The aviary is dark, and a number of small orange lamps illuminate the trail. High above, one of Cato Neimoidiaâ€™s moons shines down through the canopy of trees, casting a faint silvery hue over everything within.
Shadows flicker across the floor of the aviary as the swaying trees within block out the moonlight shining down through the ceiling. The occasional flutter of wings or gust of air can be heard faintly as a bird takes flight or lands on a nearby branch. The soft rustle of leaves provides a thin background noise, masking the sounds of your footsteps as you pass down the dimly lit winding path, flanked on either side by the trunks of large trees.
Once everyone is inside the door behind you suddenly closes and locks.
In the distance you hear the high pitched sound of a whistle being sounded and the caw of large birds. And soon you can see them. This large black bird has a smooth, sloping head and reflective eyes, its black-feathered body looming large in the darkness. Razor-sharp talons cap the end of its claws, and the creatureâ€™s massive wingspan makes it seem nearly the size of a small Human.

Two of the giant birds swoop down to attack the nearest person, which happens to be Ardon. One of the birds connects, slashing at Ardon with its sharp talons. (12 points of damage).
Ardon draws his weapon and prepares for more onslaughts, attacking the closest bird as it flies past. Though it connects, the bird continues past.
Talon pulls out his Westar blaster and fires on th Kreehawk which attacked Ardon and his shot goes wide.
Kyle igniting his saber and turns toward the door, attempting to forcibly open it.
Raia draws his heavy blaster pistol and fires on one of the approaching birds. The quick shot catches the kreehaw off guard and hits.
Brand ignites his saber and takes a defensive stance.
Brome, drawing his blaster, fires two rapid shots at the same bird Raia hit. The bird, unable to dodge quickly enough is hit and falls to the ground.

Two Kreehawks swoop down to attack Brand. One is able to get through Brand's defenses and critically slashes at him with its talons. (30 damage). As it moves away Brand swings at it with his lightsaber and misses. The third Kreehawk swoops down at Ardon also getting through his defenses (10 damage). As it moves away Ardon attacks it, his lightsaber connecting.
Ardon continuing his defensive stance and takes another swing at the Kreehawk, missing it completely.
Talon taking aim, fires on one of the Kreehawks attacking Brand hitting the giant bird.
Kyle continues to attempt to cut down the door.
Brand moves defensively toward the mysterious whistler.
Brome fires at the whistle blower barely missing him or her.
The whistle blower in response fires at Brome, the shot bouncing off his armor.
Getting closer Brand and Brome see the whistle blower is Kessra, the Viper gang leader.

The Kreehawks continue their assualt. Two swoop down at Brand, both missing as Brand counterattacks scoring a critical hit on one of the birds as it passes. The last bird swoops to attack Ardon. As Ardon dodges the attack he swings at the bird also scoring a critical hit. Only one Kreehawk remains.
Ardon continues his defensive stance attacking the remaining bird, which dodges his attacks.
Talon fires on the last bird, the shot hitting. The bird falls to the ground unmoving as Talon moves toward the mysterious whistle blower.
Raia also moves toward the whistle blower and takes a shot, but is unable to see the target so the shot goes wide.
Brand approaches Kessra and resuming his defensive stance waits.
Brome continues forward, firing two rapid shots at Kessra and Kessra barely dodges the incoming shots.
Kessra in response fires at Brome, but the shot bounces harmlessly off his armor.
Only Kessra remains. Brand is adjacent with Brome only a few squares away. Talon and Raia now see it is Kessra. Ardon and Kyle are still near the door and will take 2 move actions to reach Kessra.

Kyle still at the door realizes the door has been doubly reinforced and he's just making things worse. He stays at the door to prevent Kessra from leaving, though with his attempts at cutting open the door, it may be impossible for it to open.
Raia aims and takes a shot off at Kessra, the shot hitting her squarely and causing her to stumble.
Brand succeeds in cutting in front of her, using the force to increase momentum he flips over her. He continues his defensive stance.
Brome aims and fires on the now surrounded Kessra, missing.
Kessra looking around sees she has no where else to go, she drops her weapon and holds her hands out.

"We defeat you and your band, and you come at us alone?" Ardon asks. "It does seem like turning you into Darga would be a good idea," the Twi'lek muses, but the thought of her being imprisoned then turns to the logical conclusion that she would be tortured, perhaps to death. He changes his mind. "If you attack us again, we may not be as merciful."

"However, for her crimes, she owes us." He raises a brow. "We still need to look at those records. Perhaps she can help us, maybe somehow distract the record keeper for us while we search the room."

Talon moves to his friends to start checking them over for injurys. "I am sure this little battle has rasied some alarm and guards will be on there way soon. We may have to turn her over to Darga anyway." Talon puts away his blaster and opens up his medkit. "At any rate I need to patch you guys up agian so who is frist?"

Brand responds to Talon. "She's been defeated twice. Her crimes are against us, true, but we are neither judge nor jury. And neither is Darga." He crosses his arms, tilting his head and looking at Kessra. "Perhaps she'll see through our example that treating others with fairness and kindness is more rewarding. We are truly all one in the Force."
He then turns as if to leave. "I'm not so sure that just asking the record keeper for information would work.. but I suppose it's worth a try."

I am not as forgiving, When Darga finds out about this he is going to want to know who is to blame and we will be the ones left trying to explain and Hutts are not the forgiving kind." Talon looks back over at Kressa. "I think we should give her to Darga and let him deside maybe we can help make the punishment less sever then it would normal be." "But, my I will go with what the rest of you deside to do." Talon moves to the next injured person and pulls out another med pack.

Now in the presence of Darga, the droid races are coming to a close, and the court is setting up entertainment in the main room. While this is happening Darga summons you over to him. When you are before him he says quietly, with 66 translating.
"The visitors I have been expecting have arrived and I expect the Empire's liason will try to double-cross me. Deals with the Empire have great potential rewards," he says, "but one must always be careful when negotiating with such powerful allies. I ask you to watch the proceedings and help me retain the upper hand in these negotiations"
He looks at you expectantly, waiting for a reply.

"Of course Mighty Darga we would be honored to assites you with the negoeation." Talon finds a sever who has some Corillian Whiskey and takes glass an then ask for a bottle. Then he finds a comfrontable place to sit down. "May I ask what this meeting will be about? Your Greatness."

"It is over a business arrangement."
A servant approaches Darga and whispers something unintelligible to the HUtt.
"Ah" Darga says, then looks to all of you. "They have arrived."
Darga motions for you all to step off to one side then signals for the guards and three people are ushered into Dargaâ€™s audience chamber: two men and one woman. Though none of them is wearing any kind of Imperial uniform, whispers of â€œImperial agentsâ€ ripple through the court. The two men are dressed in basic laborerâ€™s clothing, and their eyes scan the room as if they expect an attack at any moment. The woman is also simply dressed, but it is clear from her bearing that she considers herself well above this assignment.
For Brand and Talon only:
[hide]You notice that each of the men carries an identical blaster carbine, and in fact the two men could be twins, other than a few small differences, such as the placement of scars.[/hide]
For Brand, Kyle and Talon only:
[hide]You recognize the liaison as someone you spotted in the halls of Organaâ€™s palace on Alderaan.[/hide]
Darga rolls his eyes meaningfully in your direction and then greets the newcomers (â€œAlways a pleasure to serve the Empire! What can I do for you today?â€). Neither the agent nor her guards seem to notice the Huttâ€™s glance toward you.
The woman wastes no time in speaking. "Mighty Darga, whilest your current shipments of Tibanna gas have been sufficient so far, the Empire needs you to step up production immediately. I am prepared to offer on behalf of the Empire an 80% increase in payments for a 100% increase in output, which seems fair since you will be making more money overall. Additionally, the Empire is willing to offer a further 20% increase in payments for the.. "biological" resources. The Empire is also willing to provide a personal Imperial security retinue as a sign of continued good faith. There would be an Imperial regiment stationed in the city of Zarra and a flight of starfighters, ready in your event of need."
Darga considers her offers then says "I will have to deliberate over your generous propositions. Please allow my Majordomo to escort you for some refreshments while you wait." The liason nods and everyone clears the room, leaving just all of you and Darga in the room. Turning to you he says, "Well, what are your opinions on the Empire's offers?"
((Here's some information you gleaned from knowledge checks))
Talon
[hide]Imperial contracts are almost always spread very thin, and that the Empire rarely offers substantial contract increases to individuals.[/hide]
Brand
[hide]The Empire has made offers of security retinues to nobles and powerful administrators in the past, most of the time on worlds where Imperial forces were particularly thin.[/hide]

"The money seems good. But I think the Troops and the fighters might away of keeping a closer eye on you and your dealings." Talon takes a drink of the whiskey, letting its warm smokey wood taste set in hos mouth for a moment untill he shallowed. "I would advise caution on your part Mighty one, She doesn't seem the type to underestimate." Talon hopes that the Imperials didn't notice them. It would be octword to explain why they wanted to shot them in front of there host.
After another drink Talon motions for Brand and Kyle to come over to where he is so they can discuss somethings. Turning to Darga. "It seems alittle high for what the Empire would normally offer one person. They must need what you have very baddly so might have some room to manuver here she also doesn't seem very interested in being here."

"That sounds like an awful lot of money. Tibanna gas is for laser, I wounder how much her has delivered so far to the Imps." whispering to Talon. "Also I know the agent's face from Alderaan, I think that needs to be reported bad to Bail Organa."

Talon takes another drink. "I would agree to it if the price was fair and sence I have no knowledge of what they are paying you for the slaves I would say yes unless you might beable to get more for yourself but as I said I don't have the knowledge needed to advice you on this." Talon trys to hiney coat his words to make them sound more to Dargas liking. Dealing with Hutts can be tricky and he had no desire to wind up being one who owed a Hutt anything. "As far as the retinue I agree that is out of the question. You make your delivers on time and they are happy with that so they can be happy with it still."

"Ok, ok He tells us what he knows we cut him lose. It's a deal." Talon says reluctantly. "Make fast because we need to get out of here." Talon checks and make sure his gear is on his person and ready to go. Then he checks with Kyle to see if the ship is ready to leave.

Okeefe: ~Yes? Is it time to leave yet? My sensors are showing an Imperial I - class star destroyer coming into the system. We should probably get out of here fast~
===============================================================
Demos glances between Brome and Talon and then smiles. Slowly he stands and says so all of you can hear, "Darga has left for his safe house on Cloud City on the planet Bespin." He nods having said what he agreed to, he then begins to move away.

**Bit of transcript goodness**
[hide]** Ardon leans against the crates, coughing. **
** Brome walks up to the boss and smiles "Hello...pal" **
Alicia: The Boss just glares at the two of you
Azaria: (can she get enough time to recover her force powers for say 3 uses of vital transfer)
** Ardon quickly pats out the smoldering portions of his clothing. **
Alicia: yes.. just takes a minute to rest
Brome: "Ok brand we're turnening him in right"
** Brand puts his lightsaber away, looking at Brome, then the ugnaught in disappointment. "Everyone always wants to fight. And they always lose. Don't you realize I hate killing. Look waht you make me resort to." **
Brand: "Looks like we have to now. Unless there's some way he can convince us otherwise."
Alicia: The Boss doesn't say anythig
** Azaria uses it on kyle, ardon and brand once each (once it recovers) **
Alicia: make the rolls
** Brand reaches into the ugnaught's dirty pockets and takes his keypad back. "I take your silence means you'd rather just be turned into the authorities." **
Brome: "Well most people don't like waht we and want to kill us, so come lets got turn him in"
Brand: LOL I'm the most hurt and i get the worst roll LOL
Alicia: 20 to Kyle, 15 to Ardon, 10 rto BRand
** Ardon utters his thanks to Azaria. **
** Azaria seems very tired after that.... **
** Brome points his blasted at the Boss "Come on you're comming with me" **
** Brand grabs the Ugnaught by the ear. "Tell us how to find Darga." **
** Brome walks over to Azaria "You didn't have to do that" he says offering his hand to help her **
Alicia: "I don't know"
Azaria: "you helped me it was the least i could do..."
Brome: "Come on lets get you out of here, Brand we'll take him to the others and get the info from them"[/hide]

Following the directions given by Krygg and Fryen at the Parliment of Guilds, you came across the Ugnaughts who had been siphoning off Tibanna gas illegally for Darga. After Brand attempted to negotiate peacefully to get in touch with Darga there was an explosive fight in which all but the ringleader was killed. Now in your custody the boss claims he doesn't know where Darga is.

Kyle walks over to the ugnaught and ask him "How much Tibbian gase have you transferred for Darga?" Kyle then points to the computer, "Check you logs if you have to, I will be watching you." Looking at the others, "This could be vailuable information to the Intelligence people."

"Surely you know how many shipments there have been, though," Ardon says as he returns his lightsaber to its rightful place. "Or at the very least know who does," he adds. "In other words… how does Darga know you're not cheating him?"

((I will assume you take your hostage to Krygg and Fryen))
Arriving back at the office of the Parliment of Guilds, the two Ugnaughts seem pleased and they thank you for helping to restore some of their people's reputation.
True to their agreement they tell you what they know about the Hutt.
The Hutt has long been taking the Tibanna gas siphoned from Figg & Associates and selling it to the Empire. The transactions are usually discrete, and they have been unable to learn what Darga gets out of the deal. However, they know that the next transaction will take place during the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament. Fyren suggests that you visit the Yerith Bespin hotel (one of the finest in the city) or the Royal Casino (where this yearâ€™s tournament is to be held). Though the Empire rarely makes itself known on Cloud City, so many strangers have arrived in the last few days that almost anyone, including Imperial agents, could be involved in the tournament.

### **Alicia** (2008-06-27 12:26:23)

Kryyg and Fryen don't know much about the tournament and suggest you take your questions to the Royal Casino staff.

---

## Session 11 continues

### **Alicia** (2008-06-29 22:45:44)

After turning over the Ugnaught boss to Fryen and Kryyg at the Parliament of Guilds they told you what they knew about what Darga was up to. Following the lead you made your ways to the Casino, inquired about the tournament (finding out about the extensive winnings) and then went to check out the Yerith Bespin hotel.
There you overheard Baron Kithriss complaining to the concierge about his room. When the Baron left with his entourage (unarmored clone troopers and the 2 Theelin female body guards), Brome decided to follow to get some pointers from the troopers. The Baron confronted Brome and Talon and when the entourage turned to leave the Baron decided to attack the assembled party.
A fight ensued and most of his entourage was killed and the Baron was knocked unconscious. Taking the Baron captive you took him back to the Banshee. You found these items of importance on his person: a datapad (which only Ardon has read), a credit chip, and a keycard to his suite at the Yerith Bespin.
**On the datapad:**
[hide]The datapad contains travel logs that identify him as Baron Kithriss, a wealthy noble from Chandrila. The logs show that prior to coming to Bespin, he spent a great deal of time on a political retreat in the Deep Core, seemingly at Palpatineâ€™s behest. Baron Kithrissâ€™s datapad includes instructions to meet up with his â€œretainersâ€ (the clone troopers) and travel to Bespin, securing accommodations at the Yerith Bespin hotel and awaiting further instructions. Moreover, he is to let no one know that he is an agent for the Empire, and he must maintain complete communications silence except to receive instructions on his hotel computer.[/hide]
You were leaving the Baron on the Banshee with Okeefe to watch over him and were heading back into the city.
Please remember weapons are not permitted inside the city and those who haven't already will need to inform me if different weapons than before were being taken in.
[hide]Ardon - lightsaber, pistol
Azaraia - none
Brand - lightsaber
Brome - pistol
Kyle - lightsaber
Talon - pistol[/hide]
(( I assume you make your way to the Yerith Bespin to check out the Baron's room. If not please ignore the following ))
Making your way back to the hotel you see the previous concierge is now off duty. The current one greets you upon entering and when you show him the keycard he directs you to the lift which will take you to the suite. Inserting the keycard into the lift it takes you directly to the correct floor where there are only a few doors to choose from. Eventually you find the correct room.
The Yerith Bespin is one of the oldest and finest hotel establishments on Cloud City. Every room is spectacularly appointed, and itâ€™s easy to imagine that only hotels on Coruscant are nicer. Your every need is addressed by the hotel staff, and you can spend your downtime enjoying almost any luxury activity found in upscale hotels throughout the galaxy. The hotel is significantly nicer than the accommodations in Dargaâ€™s palace, and it beats trudging through the jungles of Felucia by a wide margin.
Standing in the foyer you can see: the sitting room which connects into a kitchenette and dining area, and five doors. Four of the doors lead into bedrooms (1 at the end of a hall is the largest) and the last is an office.

Talon checks around the suite and then finds aroom and makes himself comfrotable. "So I guess we are just going to wait here untill they try to contact our friend that we have hold up in our ship?" While waiting for something to happen Talon takes out the Sabac deck he took off the nobleand starts to check over the cards and shuffle the deck. " I wonder why they would pick a contact like him? He doesn't seem like alot, and his gaurds folded pretty quickly. What do you guys think?"

All of you spend the next few days in relative luxury as you await for more information. (( If you wanted to do anything else please declare it now )) On the third day of your stay (1 day till the tournament) the computer in the office beeps as it receives a message.
[hide]**Missive from Coruscant:** Transaction codename SARLACC065824 set to occur during Cloud City Sabacc Tournament as planned. The Hutt has assured us that his agent will be present to receive the handoff. An officer from the *Assiduous* will be taking part in the tournament. The transaction will occur during play so as to avoid arousing suspicion. You are responsible only for observing this transaction and making sure that the Huttâ€™s agent does nothing to endanger the secrecy of the arrangement. Under no circumstances are you to interfere with the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, send a confirmation message to Coruscant standard relay 88-Shen- Xesh-3, then return to Chandrila.

"There are two sides to the Force," Ardon explains. "That which can be used for good: and that which can be used for evil. It's obvious that there would be conflict there. What happened was–to be put it very simply–those that believed that their ways of using the Force was the best way grouped together. The Jedi and the Sith. Constantly have the Sith tried to assert their dominance on both the Jedi and the Galaxy: driven by their own lust for power.
"Now the Sith are in control," he finishes. "And by the Force may it be a short reign."

[coor=orange]"That's not exactly true," Ardon replies. "The Force–the gift–has two sides. Good and evil. We must never use the evil portion of it: the one based on our anger, hatred, and fear. Doing so would corrupt us, make us as evil as what we're trying to take down…"
His voice trails, wondering if the more dubious acts that he'd been commiting recently would continue to accumulate and begin his own corruption.

## Session 12 continued...

### **Alicia** (2008-07-06 12:52:37)

Day 3 of the torurnament has ended and so far over past 3 days some of you have spoken to Lt. Armen Arandis (of the Empire), Lady Mirana Fioro (Happan noble), Vorn Zaday (Neimodian) and Koroma Mora (Switch's Twi'lek captain).
Only 8 competitors remain: Lt Arandis, Cresska (a Rodian male), Silas Draver, Lady Fioro, Captain Moro, Vorn Zaday, and your very own player, Talon.
As you all head back to the ship you receive a message from Okeefe.
"It's me. Just thought I would let you know Crash has been intercepting a lot of transmissions the last couple of days that use Imperial codes, and there seems to be a good deal of communications chatter on channels not normally used by civilians. We've only been able to decode only a few of the messages, it appears that they are busier in the city than we thought. Moreover, heâ€™s caught references to Darga in these messages, confirming that the Hutt is still in Cloud City, though we have no idea where, exactly."
"What's more, Imperial communications chatter has died down, as of today.
Also, Crash has been monitoring communications from the Medium Transport *Shackles of Nizon*, which is still in orbit over the planet. He has been picking up infrequent signals from the ship that are consistent with signals used by slave circuits."
((She is still on the comm if you wish to speak with her.))
When you arrive back to the hotel, the staff at the desk inform you that a message has been left there. Taking the note you discover it is from Switch.
**The note reads:**[hide]I have heard that Captain Moro has been doing very well, but I would like to help him further in this final round. I have had the liberty of a certain pieces of software be sent to you. It will contain instructions.[/hide]
**Description of Creeska**
[hide]Creeska is a Rodian gambler who has made a name for himself as an exceptionally aggressive competitor. Though he is friendlyâ€”and surprisingly likable, for a Rodianâ€”he never wants to back down from a bluff and has used his gambling muscle to intimidate his opponents into making mistakes. Creeska wears a bulky jacket made of Krayt dragon leather (or so he claims) and is quite generous in sharing his winnings with others in the casino.[/hide]
**Description of Silas Draver**
[hide]Cool, suave, and sophisticated, Silas Draver is the perfect image of the Human gambler. With long black hair pulled back in a ponytail and a mustache that droops down both sides of his mouth, Silas always wears a confident smirk, and he always speaks as though he knows something that the person heâ€™s talking to does not. Draver is a savvy gambler who plays it close to his chest.[/hide]
**Description of Captain Moro**
[hide]Koroma Moro is a starship captain who also happens to be an exceptional gambler. He is a polite but secretive man.[/hide]

"I kriffed up with Zaday," Ardon says as he considers the possibilities of who among the seven are in on the transaction that is to take place. "I was able to speak with Fioro. She seems eager to play against Lt. Arrandis, so we should take that for whatever it's worth. The transactions are for the Empire, but I doubt that it would be as obvious as an Imperial lieutenant who plays in his uniform…
"Those of us just watching the game need to question the remaining players and try to get them–in the course of normal conversation–to reveal who they're really looking forward to playing against. That could be a very vital clue."

/me studies your techniques and matches most of them with similar techniques her force teachings seem to be fairly advanced in senses, meditation and healing but seems utterly perplexed by the move object techniques and seems utterly inept at them barely able to handle even their simplest manifestations....
"my people where should I start, we don't have all this machinery we tend to live from the land, from the harvests, we live in small communities, its forbidden to gather in any larger numbers. my gift is rare among my people only a few in each generation, but those that are gifted are brought into my family to protect the people and teach the gifted to use it wisely. we can foresee the mist storms and heal those in need. it would be my task now that my mother died to take her role and guide the people the best i can warning them of dangers and offering my advice."

(i'm posting here a long extended chat between brand and azaria)
[hide]Azaria: /me looks up from her meditations "um help aren't you busy with your plans?"
Brand: Brand shakes his head. "No, I let the others make the plans while I give suggestions. Often, I let them make their own mistakes unless I see that it will harm them."
Azaria: "so how can i help, i kinda feel useless in this strange place"
Brand: "I was just curious as to how you came to be here and where you are from."
Azaria: "well where should i start. from where i'm from of my family or the kidnapping"
Brand: "Where are you from is a good start."
Azaria: "well i know less now about where i'm from seeing what ive seen"
Azaria: "all my world was consisted of the land from the mist sea to the mist sea.... from the mists to the cloud layer, and all the hills that stretched from the mists to the clouds"
Brand: "It might be simpler if you just told me the name of the planet."
Azaria: "it never had a name all we knew was between those boundaries,.. we didn't realize we were on a planet... all we saw we thought was all that was,"
Azaria: "until the day the fire dragon pierced the clouds and we started wondering where it came from..."
Brand: Brand raises an eyebrow. "You should not be here then. You belong home where it is safer. Tell me about the kidnapping."
Azaria: "its safer here it seems but so strange theirs no mists here"
Azaria: my family are seers but their not all really my family a few are from other places in the hills and brought to my family once their gift was realized"
Azaria: "its our job to protect the people to predict the mists and give guidance and healing. when the storms come we warn the villages to move to safe ground"
Azaria: "we keep the old ways and the histories of our people... but back to the kidnapping i guess"
Brand: Brand listens intently.
Azaria: "the fire dragon pierced the cloud layer and plunged towards the mists landing heavily on a lone hilltop at in the mist sea shallows... the hill blazed and then our scouts reported they had found something where it had landed"
Azaria: "the scouts reported uni lights near the hill... and a metal..... egg as big as a village embedded into the hilltop"
Azaria: "it was a few days before we could extend a bridge across the mist to the hilltop. and the scouts returned with strange things... metal as i now know it, machinery and a survivor"
Azaria: "he was dying wounded badly and poisoned by the mist.. my family helped all they could our combined gift was barely enough to cure his poisoning"
Azaria: "he had strayed from the .. ship as i now know it into the mists then staggered out and collapsed"
Azaria: "he stayed with us and we treated his wounds fed him and he seemed fascinated by our ways"
Azaria: "a storm was coming one even we couldn't comprehend... my mum detected the storm and sent word to the other villages to retreat into the refuges"
Azaria: "he seemed fascinated and inquired how we knew and not being used to deception we told him."
Azaria: "he asked us to show him this gift and seeing no harm in it we read his future"
Brand: "I'm guessing he was a member of the Empire..."
Azaria: "there was me my mother 3 other sisters and several brothers, they were family but had no gift only one man we knew of even had the gift and he was only thought to be a myth"
Azaria: "my mother was elderly and my sisters powers were weaker than mine. "
Azaria: "the empire? no he was something far worse"
Brand: "What then?"
Azaria: "we told him his future how he'd come into a fortune on [besper]? he seemed very interested and we were confused wed never heard of a hill called [bespir]"
Azaria: "he was better now and returned to his ship after the storm passed and we returned to our lives only this time their was whispers about where this fore dragon was from.... nothing else had fallen.... maybe he was a sky god"
Azaria: "but you'd have to be silly to beleive that,."
Azaria: "it was a few days later after he'd been at his ship for a while when he returned at night he grabbed me and started to drag me out of my home. my brothers and mother tried to stop him but flashes of light flicked from a device in his hands and they fell dead"
Brand: Brand continues listening, thinking on it, almost meditatively.
Azaria: "he pulled me on board his ship and the next i knew i couldn't feel the mists or the uni or anything outside"
Azaria: "just coldness... he explained i would help him get his fortune, he talked alot he seemed to think my gift would help him at gambling"
Azaria: "he seemed to owe alot of money to a hutt.. i didn't know what that meant at the time but i would soon"
Azaria: "his ship landed here and he went out to try his luck at the casino and returned later happy he'd won big. "
Brand: Brand ohs as he finally understands. "So... where is this man now, do you know?"
Azaria: /me nods
Brand: Brand stops to continue listening.
Azaria: "to celibate he let me out of the ship and went to a canteena to get some food as he'd run out. he was sitting at the table in front of me bragging about his win to people nearby when two suited figures walked up and asked for his name"
Azaria: "at first he told them but then was terrified as they said they were here for his debt, he tried to pay them off but they said it was to little to late and..... took him outside"
Azaria: "when i went outside he was dead.... and the ship was gone"
Brand: Brand nods again. "That's unfortunate, though I suppose he died appropriately. So now you wish for Kyle to teach you the ways of the Jedi."
Azaria: "i don't know.... i feel they don't share my beliefs either"
Brand: "It depends on what your beliefs are. The Jedi are not made up of beliefs, but instead a path. A path that guides a person toward the light instead of the dark."
Brand: "The Force, which is how you have your power, is touchy. The wrong actions can lead you into darkness and twist your soul until you are ugly and evil."
Brand: "The Jedi way is meant to lead you down a path of righteousness."
Azaria: "maybe, but i was taught not to interfere in the thoughts or choices of another"
Azaria: "..........."
Brand: "We are taught the same, however, there are times when it necessary to keep the peace. It's not a practice we look lightly upon."
Azaria: "......... you seem to be getting involved alot though....."
Brand: "Involved in which, exactly? What is it you think we're doing that is against your beliefs?"
Azaria: "the fight near the vat? how many lives were ended......."
Azaria: "isn't that interfering in a persons life... to much"
Brand: Brand sighs, sitting back. "Too many. I try to resolve each conflict with as little violence as possible, but our enemies are hungry for violence. Too many times they fight to the death." He looks at you evenly.l "I assure you, our intentions are to end the violence, but it is not easy."
Brand: "This darkside I have mentioned has possessed our enemies, and those same enemies have taken control of our government. We are trying to restore control to the proper hand."
Azaria: "......... you see what i mean though ive been taught that every life is sacred and to be sustained..."
Brand: "This is true. We are taught the same. What can one do, though, when your enemies are intent on taking the life of all those who believe in peace? The peace keepers must step in and make a choice." He folds his hands together. "It is better for one to die than thousands to dwindle and suffer in unbelief."
Azaria: /me sighs "this place is .. so lost isn't it"
Brand: "The stronger a nation grows, the more evil presents itself. It is the cycle of life and the balance of the Force. Even in your world you can see it in the mist and your struggle to survive it's poison."
Azaria: "the mist isn't evil it just is, theirs so much life in the mist its just we cannot breath it"
Brand: "Evil is in the intention of the sentient being. I do not mean to say your mist is evil, but its nature is to take the life of those in its path. It just is, and so is the Force. So is the Darkness and the Light."
Azaria: "ah ok.... id like to learn of this force though even if just to take its teachings back to my people when i return"
Brand: Brand shakes his head at that. "That is what I cannot allow you to do." he says, almost sadly. "Hundreds of years ago this knowledge of the Force was taken to others, and they learned its nature. Without a proper guidance, however, it can corrupt. The saying Power Corrupts, Absolute Power corrupts absolutely applies."
Brand: "It would take you a lifetime to learn the Force appropriately, and you would not have the time to teach it to those on your home world appropriately."
Azaria: "how is the force taught to people here?"
Brand: "Carefully. One Master and one Student, under the guidance of a Council."
Brand: "The Council is made up of Masters. And so it grows, and even that can be flawed."
Azaria: "what of my people then, the gift exists there even now although in small numbers"
Brand: "You can be taught the Force, Azaria, but you cannot take it back to your people until you yourself have become a Master. Your people have existed in their own path for an uncountable amount of time, and they will continue to thrive in their own way..." he says before continuing.
Brand: "Only a few have the gift of the Force, and that is what they need to survive. When you become a Master, only then can you go back to your people and take upon yourself a student. Only one until he or she becomes a Master, then and on;ly then can you take upon yourself another student."
Azaria: "so the choice is to go back home or learn from this place then?"
Brand: "Yes, those are your choices."
Azaria: "do you know how to get me home yet?"
Brand: "no."
Brand: "That I may never know, not without your kidnappers ship and log events."
Azaria: "........... oh"
Azaria: "could i learn how to find my way home?"
Brand: "Your people miss you, Azaria, but your return could do more harm than good. What they do not know will not hurt them. It's better, for now, for them to live without knowledge of what lies above."
Brand: "That is possible, yes."
Azaria: "what would you advise"
Brand: "I would advise that you learn everything you can here, master the ways of the Force and only go back to your people when you are ready. Then you could become as the one you know of as Myth."
Azaria: "................... i will train but id never become like him. but no matter what i will keep to my beliefs, i will never harm another... is that ok"
Brand: "Why do you say you could never become like him?"
Azaria: "according to myth he took control of the hills and ignored the old ways hurt those who opposed him....."
Azaria: "the forest swallowed him and his city....... "
Azaria: "in the chaos that followed the seers guided the people but the villages never converged again."
Brand: Brand ohs. "The way you said it earlier it sounded as if he were a hero." He smiles. "What I meant then, was that you could become as a Myth, one they will speak of hundreds of years a later as the one to bring them the Light."
Azaria: "maybe.... "[/hide]

"I will try." Kyle then begins to explain the Jedi Code and what it means to be Jedi.
"There is no emotion, there is peace. There is no ignorance, there is knowledge. There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no death, there is the Force. Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy. This is the code we live by. This is what it means to be a Jedi. Jedi use our powers to defend and protect, never to attack others. Jedi respect all life, in any form. Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy. Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.

The Glorious Chariot is a Luxury 3000 space yacht designed by the SoroSuub corporation. This particular vessel was customized for Darga the Hutt. The interior of the ship was once very nice, but like the inside of Dargaâ€™s palace, it has been used as a den of iniquity for far too long. Much of the interior is in severe disrepair, and some parts of the ship can only be classified as â€œdisgusting.â€ However, Darga knew better than to trust his enemies to fail to recognize his ship, and thus he had aftermarket modifications made to the yacht to add extra defensive weapons that are normally manned by his crew.
When you board the ship, a few of Dargaâ€™s crewmembers are in the cabin area, hoping to be left alone. One look at you, however, and they rush out in fear.

With the TIE Fighters and the tibanna gas hauler destroyed, the Shackles of Nizon (the ship which was transporting the slaves be used by the Empire as partial payment for the gas.) with its safety assured, sends a simple text message: "We have gained control. Thank you." With that the engines of the ship flare to life, and seconds later, it makes a jump to hyperspace, with no other fanfare.
However, all is not safe in the Bespin system. The Assiduous (the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer which deployed the TIE fighters) is fast approaching. You can see the distant dagger shape of the Star Destroyer rapidly approaching. From the planet, the Banshee makes an appearance.
Through the ship's comms you hear Captain Okeefe speaking.
Okeefe: "I recommend we not stay longer than needed."

Okeefe transmits a set of hyperspace data to your fighters. The Star Destroyer is almost within range as the Banshee's engines warm up for the jump into hyperspace.
As your own ship's are about to follow suite you see that you are receiving a signal from the Assiduous.

### **Alicia** (2008-10-12 20:39:38)

The speakers in the fighter crackle to life as Ardon (and anyone else) accepts the transmission. On a screen the image resolves to show the bridge of the Star Destroyer Assiduous. Standing before the view screen is a darkly handsome man wearing long, flowing robes. The hilt of a lightsaber hangs from his belt.
"My sensor operators tell me that your ships will be far enough from Bespin to jump to hyperspace before I can reach you. I congratulate you on your victory here, but know this: the Inquisitorius never rests. My name is Valin Draco, and I will find you and you will pay for meddling here. You may have bested that slimy Hutt, but I can assure you that the affections of an Inquisitor are not so gentle."
With that the transmission is cut off as all your ships jump into hyperspace.
The coordinates take you with range of the Nebulon-B cruiser Resurgence. There you are given clearance to dock/land the ships. Once you are settled on the ship it jumps into hyperspace and everyone is requested to come to the meeting room to be debriefed by Captain Verena.

He says very little to anyone, choosing to listen more than participate, as usual. There will be much meditation later for him to do.

Waiting in the debriefing room is Captain Verena, who greets you as each of you enter.
When all of you are settled he steeples his fingers in front of him and rests his hand on the table top.
He gives Azaria a furtive glance and asks. "How much have you let on about your mission to this young lady? "

"Actually sir, we told her very little about our mission. She has however been a great help to our team." Kyle looks and assures her with a smile.

((This posting thing seems to be going very slow, so I'll post again. -^- ))
Brand speaks up from his place near the back of the room. Leaning forward, he interlocks his fingers, a serious look on his face. "Yes, that's true, we have spoken to her very little about the perameters of our mission. However, we feel her to be very trustworthy She is also sensitive to the effusions of the Force, and I have taken it upon myself to be sure she is educated in the ways of the Force and possibly the Jedi schema. With the Inquisitoria and the Empire as it is, leaving her uneducated would be dangerous both for her, and possibly for us if they were to get their hands on her."

Verena looks at Brand sharply when he says the name Inquisitorius. "Have you met up with the Inquisitorius on your mission?" He seems very troubled by the possibility.

Brand purses his lips and nods, a soft sigh escaping. "I think we did. Not directly, however, as we were leaving, we received an incoming message from an Inquisitor, promising that we were now on his red list, so to speak."

Ardon shakes his head. "Brand's right: we haven't met with them personally, but we did get a message from them. I personally don't want to meet with them again, that's for sure," he adds.

Verna reaches up to rub his chin. "Still it is a disturbing coincidence. It is something we will have to investigate further. If the Inquisitorius are involved with the Sarlaac project.. " he seems to think further on this thought.
He drops his hand and looks at all of you. "The implications of their involvement will have to be deliberated, for now we need to look over the information collected by Okeefe from your last mission. Is there anything you wish to report?"

Brand, after realizing no one is going to say anything, reports the entire events of the mission to Cloud City, leaving NOTHING out.

Kyle also makes a report on activities and that they may need an expense account for future missions.
Also explains that Azaria is a healer and maybe interest to see the med bay.

Verena nods, "That reminds me, Master Denia has recovered from her injuries sufficiently. She has decided to remain and assist us. If you wish to speak with her you can find her in the guest wing.
Now then, if there is nothing else... you're dismissed. "

Kyle takes Azaria to meet Master Denia. He is also eager to continue his training as a Jedi.

Talon takes a seat in the breifing room. He checks over the blaster he was forced to use for now. "Anyone know where I can pick up a Westar 34. I seem to have misplaced mine." Looking over the blaster saddly. "So you got anything for us to do cause I have about a life time worth of Hutt smell to get out of that transport of mine." Talon being his usall self trying to keep the work following and at least keep his bosses back on Corillia happy with him.

Ardon listens intently as Brand spares no punches with his report to the captain of the ship. In shame for his un-Jedi-like behavior in completely insisting on conflict with Brome. Whike he may have been in the right, his adherence almost tore the group completely asunder.

OOC No updates from Sat? Are we just waiting for next Sat to continue on from where we left off?

OOC: Yes, I never got around to starting this back up, but it will be after next session since I'm not sure I will be able to run the Saturday following Christmas (Dec 27).
