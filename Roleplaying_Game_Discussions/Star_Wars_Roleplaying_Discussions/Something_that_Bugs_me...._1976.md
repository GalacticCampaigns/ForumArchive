# Something that Bugs me....

### **ganthet** (2007-11-05 11:27:22)

I am tried of hearing all these people go on Wizards froums and complain about Saga because of this and that. When they havn't even played it. I mean if I buy a car I don't return it because I did like the color or I heard that it wasn't any good. No I try it out and see for myself. These guys come on and I don't like it because it uses minis or I heard they did this with Jedi or I hate the talent thing. They don't even try it frist then pass judgement. I f they don't want it don't buy it. What do you guys think?

I agree with you on that (even though I have done my fair share of wizards bashing). The way I see it is that it is their loss, they are obviously not having fun and may never have fun. You only ever get out of any game what you put into it, so once again their loss. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Well honestly, WotC did a good job with the SAGA ruleset. D20 didn't fit the setting and characters, IMO. Even SAGA still suffers the same issues - e.g. too many hitpoints on high levels (long live Storytelling System!).. but SAGA is at least soooo much faster and less quirky. Plus, whoever played KOTOR I & II will find the ruleset very familiar.
I have to admit, before SAGA was out, I was also bashing WotC for experimenting but this time they really did a good job. It's a matter of getting used to it - I also feel kinda cheated that I can't assign my own skillpoints, but what the heck, at least it's more foolproof <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I try to keep it as a rule for myself not to say no to something before testing it. And of course Saga has itÂ´s flaws, nothing is flawless. I agree that I canÂ´t get the people who comes up every now and then and complains about small stuff before even playing, especially those who complain about minis. I think Wizards has made it perfectly clear that minis are a **fully optional** addition to the game.
But naturally, no system can ever satisfy the tastes of every player out there

Saga does have it's flaws, but I have a hard time finding a game that doesn't.
[hide]For starters:
**Shadowrun:** clunky, and it caters to cyber'ed up Samurai more than anything else.
**Exalted:** Great setting, and I love the anime flavor...but unless you know every rule in the book, you can't run it.
**Rolemaster:** I don't know anything good about this system. It took me six hours to make a "3rd level" character.
**Mutants and Masterminds:** Incredible d20 system. Classless, which I love, but the power limits few artificial. Cuz, ya know, they are.
**Sil-Core system** *(Heavy Gear, Tribe 8, Jovian Chronicles, Gear Kreig, CORE Command)***:** I love this system, but you best have a calculator when doing damage. And it's vechile creation rules are a bit intense.
**D&D:** Either too simple or too complex, based on the number of books you use. And way too many books.
**Storyteller System** (all things White Wolf)**:**I like the new WoD rules, as they are much faster than the old set. But they still are a bit clunky, and are unsuited for all but normal human power levels (can't use them very well in a super hero game, for example).
And the list goes one.[/hide]
I don't like how the Jedi are still king at almost everything, the ships were too different to have an underlining sturture, etc.
But the game is great. It's smooth, fast, and fun. Talents are awesome. The number of feats are great. The combat rules, including the various defenses, are great ideas and (mostly) implemented exceedingly well. Equipment and weapons are (near) prefect, and, of course, the creator support in the best I have ever seen. This is one fine book, and money well spent, one my part. And I own three Saga books. I am happy with the book. Everyone who doesn't like it...well, I'm sure there is a 12 step program from them.
*(so when I complain about something in the game, keep in mind I love the game, and I'm trying to make it better/more inline with what I think is absolutely prefect)*
Now, the Expanded Universe, *that* I have a problem with...

This is the first roleplaying book I've bought twice. And I regret neither purchase.

I got a taste of Breeders "opinions" in chat! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
But back on topic,
What bothers me the most about those people that prematurely bash Saga, or anything new they hear, is the negative wave that follows. I want Star Wars Saga to be as popular as D&D books have grown to become. The negative posts can become a chain reaction, all it takes is one person to start bashing and it seems to attract more, and then that poor unsuspecting browser reads for the first time all that negative feedback and it travels like wildfire. Star Wars is a fantastic setting, with great movies to give you visuals. We just need to catch up to the great artwork that D&D has produced. More animations, TV shows, and games are going to help the Star Wars image. The more Star Wars RPGer's we have, the better the game is going to become.
I think Star Wars Saga speaks for itself. I think there are way more people who like the new rules, and have embraced them. The amount of people who complain are far less than the ones that think it has been a great direction for Star Wars.
This is the first RPG book I didn't buy. I actually won in at Star Wars Celebration, and got to meet Rodney Thompson. He even signed it, hehe.

Well... not quite true, but one has to handle ST rules a bit freely. E.g. it's completely possible to reach Strength 10 in the old WoD ruleset (my werewolf char has str 10 in Crinos form - base 5 + totemic 1 + crinos' 4). Also I'm finishing [Slayers](http://kanzaka.wikia.com/wiki/Slayers "http://kanzaka.wikia.com/wiki/Slayers") setting & ruleset that are based on ST system (Exalted 2nd ed., to be exact) - and the only thing I had to tweak are limits on Essence (e.g. Dark Lord Shabranigdu's Essence is 25, Xellos's Essence is 15, while a mortal such as Lina Inverse can only get as high as 5). From this perspective, the ST seems the most flexible system..

This is another subject all together, but...Exalted, like I said earlier, is a very fun setting. But each and every power has it's own special set of rules. And that's a lot of power, right there. I loved everything about Werewolf: Apocalypse, and I do like Werewolf: Forsaken. But once you get passed the base templates, the rules start bogging down. Either there are a massive number of points to track, or dice to roll.
Mutants and Masterminds is the most flexible set of rules I have seen, yet. Literally anything you want, at nearly any power level. And fairly simple set of rules (to bad it's d20, and I don't want to run d20 for a while). The GM, however, needs to be on his toes, or you will end up with things called "bathroom psychics" and invisible, intangible, ghost shooters and power duplicating multi-men and worse.
This of course, is a moot point, really. There are systems I just don't want to run. Earthdawn, for example. I would never run that game by choice. But a buddy ran the game, and it was an absolute blast. Same with Shadowrun, and Werewolf, and Vampire. The GM makes things great.[/hide]
On Subject:
Again, there are flaws. I just think the pro's outweigh the cons in measurements of tons, and they set a great example for the future.

Have you looked a True20? It works as a generic system where M&M doesn't really fit games of non-superheroic status. For most intents and purposes, it's a superior system. It's certainly far simpler.

Far simpler, I'll give you. But it's still a class based system, and that limits flexibility.
It's actually pretty easy to use M&M in a non-super-hero way (M&M used in place of D&D for fantasy is fairly common). Seeing as the GM already has a hand in the character creation process- more so than other games- it's easy to add a few extra limits to prevent the super-hero feel. These aren't unheard of limitations, either: a good amount of character points in the beginning with a low power limit and you get a character with a wide base and, but nothing game breaking. Magic is already built in and pretty balanced (with no spells per day limit! Or, you could have a spells per day limit, but that's on you). M&M allows anything from gritty D&D to anime Exalted, with a lot simpler rules.
Still...not prefect.
But I'm not knocking True20. I picked it up after I got M&M, and thought, it was a very cool system. But I had made up my mind not to run another d20 system for a while, so I set it back down.
...of course, then some one batted their pretty eyes are me and said "Would you run a D&D game for us?" Go figure.
