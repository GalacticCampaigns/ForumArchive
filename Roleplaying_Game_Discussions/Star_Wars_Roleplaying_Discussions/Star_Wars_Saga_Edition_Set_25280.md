# Star Wars Saga Edition Set

### **Sketchpad** (2012-10-23 17:37:30)

Hi Gang,
I'm considering selling my Star Wars Saga Edition set. I have all the books and the GM screen, and all of them are in Near Fine to Fine condition. I'm not listing a price as of yet, as I'm interested in seeing what people might offer for the set. Serious offers only, please. Please let me know if you have any questions, I will try my best to answer them. Thanks for your interest.

You should be able to get a pretty penny for the Starships book and the KotOR one. If you don't get any pings soon, I can see if anyone I know is looking Sketch.

Thanks, Z! Honestly, I may just toss it on EBay eventually, I just wanted to give GCers first crack <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
