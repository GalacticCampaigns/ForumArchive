Okay. I'm modifying a ship, (Yes, its the *Hope Fades* From my Pirate campaign). I want to strip hanger space from it. So using the point values given under the Hanger modification section of Sotg, I end up (and I'm being conservative) with 1400 hanger points. Now since the ship is size Frigate, each of those points is 8 emplacement points.
So I end up being able to strip away 1000 Hanger Points, to get 8000 EP?

Oh yeah, those rules  <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->
I think it has been generally accepted that they arenÂ´t good, but I canÂ´t recall where to find some good fix for it. Maybe on the Wizards boards

Thank you DA.
I think for now, I'll still strip away the hanger, but give myself a much more reasonable number if emplacement points.
