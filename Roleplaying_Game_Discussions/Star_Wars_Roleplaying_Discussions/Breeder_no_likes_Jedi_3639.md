# Breeder no likes Jedi

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-11-30 22:45:23)

This is because I recognize that every time some one starts up a thread talking about Jedi- for, against, or just fiddling with them- I blather on about my dislike of their rule set, their roles in the prequels, and especially they god-like roles in the Expanded Universe. I have been derailing threads for long enough, I think. It's been unfair to those who started the threads, and I hold myself as primarily responsible.
So, here is my thread, the one I will use to whine and complain about all things Force using. Hopefully, this will help folks like **RadonAntila**, who have good ideas they want to voice and don't want to deal with off topic ranting.
Understand that I love the Saga system. I like the Force, and I even like Jedi (when they are done right). But, as you will discover below, there are parts I really, really *don't* like.
And my preliminary list of complaints will follow.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-11-30 23:59:32)

All right, and Breeder now unleashes all his Jedi fustrations:
First, the *Story and Background of the Jedi.*
In the first three movies- *A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi*, the Jedi were as they should be. They were mysterious, wise counselors who avoided trouble at all costs, fought on the defensive, and took the roles as more hermetic monks than super heroes. Obi-Won Kenobi was the old, wise mentor who died half way through the first movie. Darth Vadar was the awe inspiring bad guy with massive power- both personal and by rank. Luke was a whiny farmer kid who became a very potent warrior all his own- but *only* on the personal scale. And the Emperor was something beyond even the mightiest of heroes. So powerful was this man, so mystical that he was only defeated by Darth Vadar and by ambush.
[hide]Special Note One: when Darth Vadar first came on to the screen, you knew he was a supreme bad guy, and far more bad of a bad guy than anyone else. Movie villains have been trying to replicate what he did during that moment since, and all have failed.
Special Note Two: since when was the Emperor a Sith, anyhow? I know it's been a while, but...I liked it better when he was just One Evil Dude. He didn't belong to any organization (other than, ya know, the Empire) because he didn't need any. He didn't have a lightsaber and he didn't do back flips. He was evil incarnate, and had no use for just simple tools.[/hide]
Yes, the Jedi and the Force was cool, in those movies, but they weren't the end all and be all. That didn't show up until the Expanded Universe showed up. Luke destroyed the first Death Star, but he couldn't have done it without Han Solo. Han Solo won't have rescued the Princess if Chewbecca wasn't there, and none would have escaped if Leia didn't come to her rescuers' rescue. Lando Calrissian blew up the second Death Star, after Han Solo, Leia,and Chewbacca brought the shield down. Han Solo is the one who out flew the Empire on a routine basis. R2-D2 did more heroic stuff than Luke did (almost more than any other character, as well).
And now we have the Expanded Universe. Now, if the character doesn't have Force Powers, they're an extra. Every single Solo and Skywalker kid is super Force sensitive. A whole species (Yuuzhan Vong) dedicated themselves to wiping out a few hundred Jedi, and failed. Every Jedi, from the 16 year old apprentice on up, is a unbeatable combatant, capable of taking on the strongest of mundane warriors. The Dark Side, what was once something to fear, is now a mere inconvenience - how else can you explain how so many good guy jedi have fallen to the dark side, but some how recovered? Everything not set during the Empire has the Jedi not being wise scholar monks, but militant warriors.
Han Solo, ace pilot, smuggler and hero of the Rebel Alliance (*cough*Hanshotfirst*cough*), is now a touchy-feelie do-gooder who plays second string to his wife. No, she hasn't had more adventures than he has, she just became a Jedi.
I'm really sick of it. The whole expanded universe is nothing more than Mary Sue authors wishing they had magic powers. And the movie designers, wishing to make a product that would sell, catered to that. From that, we have what we got now: you ain't cool unless you got a glowing sword of dismemberment.
Gimme back my smugglers with hair triggers and super-strong, furry bodyguards. Gimme droids that aren't comic relief. And gimme Jedi that aren't ninja fan-boys.

haha oh wow. Man, I've missed a quite a bit, it seems.
I can't really get myself to read the EU, probably because of what you said about Mary Sue authors. The whole "redemption-from-the-Dark-Side" does seem to be overdone now.
Personally, I do like the Order as portrayed in the prequels, but that's more because of my own personal assumptions of it than what is necessarily shown in those movies. It makes sense in my own head, I guess.
I haven't got a chance to fully explore Saga, but I agree that it sucks when Jedi outclass other characters simply by being. Ithought fixed these problems with the original version?

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-12-17 00:41:44)

Rule wise, the classes are a lot closer than they were in the RCR. But, Force Users are still better than non-Force Users.
Most of the out classing comes from the part of the game I dearly love: the skill system. Say you make a noble or scout at first level. Take Force Sensitive as yer level one feat, and use one of those many skills you have in Use the Force. 2nd level on, you go Jedi. In exchange for +1 BAB, and 6 hit points, you get: 3 more trained skills (one being Use the Force), +1 to your reflex save, Shake if Off, Weapon Proficiency (pistols & rifles), and a Scout Talent (Evasion and Long Stride scream to be taken). Sure, you miss out on the other Scout talents, but you're hardly hurting for it. You can do almost everything a Scount normally does, and have Force powers to boot.
Your skills are unaffected by your class change, and all that.
Anyhow, I'm outta steam tonight, Maybe later.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 00:52:54)

Yeesh, I can begin to see why you dislike them. However, I have to wonder, would a Noble-turned-Jedi make sense from a role-playing perspective? It's not likely in the Rebellion or NJO (I know nothing about Legacy so *shrug*), practically impossible in Rise of the Empire.
My personal rule is, while a certain combination may seem overpowered, the GM has every right to deny that combination, such as when it doesn't fit, as above. You can bet, if a character wanted to do that in a game I would run, he or she better have a damned good reason to do so (or even have the means to), and even then you can be sure there'd be some sort of storyline repercussions

Why not? My current favorite Jedi character is.... 13th level, and has all of 1 level in the Jedi classes (including Jedi Knight and Jedi Master.) I don't have his character sheet handy, or I'd read his full stats and such, but the only (ONLY!) reason I took that 1 Jedi level was to get Weapon Proficiency (Lightsabers) because I was too dang cheep to buy the dang feat with one of my level or bonus feats.
The complaints that people make about the class system apply to basically all the classes though. You can take one level of Soldier, and then multiclass to Noble, and you get all those feats from Soldier plus Linguist (the only feat on the Noble's starting list that the Soldier doesn't have.)
Do force users get a bit of a bonus? Yes. But with the addition of additional supplemental material, I'm sure that'll change. In fact, it's changing already. In *Starships of the Galaxy* there are new talents, feats and other abilities that the force user is either going to miss out on, or is going to have to scrap some of his kewl force skills/powers to get.
Starship Maneuvers for example, are aquired in the same manner as Force Powers, and some of them provide distinct advantages in Starship Combat.

Unless you play a human, you lose out on the chance to get Force Powers before level 3. And depending on concept, those scout talents could be more or less important. And while you might be able to do almost everything a scout normally does (skillwise, not talentwise), he will do it 10 times better. A 1 Scout / Jedi X will never have as good Perception & Initiative abilities as a Scout X can have. Nor will he be able to have the same potential Stealth skills. Plus all the other goodies there are in for Scouts.
The same goes for all the base classes, IMO, and I think they are balanced.

The only problem I see there is a role-playing one. How would you justify dipping into Jedi not from a rules, but a role-playing perspective. No where in the series (at least that I've seen) does a character go to Jedi Academy for one day, says "LOL BYE GUYS" and goes on about his merry way, now with 'saber proficiency. Sure, I can see some multiclassing happening, depending on the story, but it still would (rather, *should*) be incredibly rare.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 16:38:58)

The info that I'm getting from the book and from specific people who were involved in the design of the game (Rodney "Moradin" Thompson, and Gary Sarli specifically) specifically says that the Jedi class is not specifically intended *just* for Jedi, and niether are Jedi restricted to *just* the Jedi class. (Please don't ask for page references or links!) but can be used to represent any character who has recieved similar training, such as a Jensari Defender, a Sith trainee, or anybody who uses a lightsaber.
In fact, what I'm getting is that you don't even need to be Force Sensitive to take the Jedi class! Even DROIDS can take it! (Although not at first level....) Although, if you are a droid or non-force sensitive sentient, you wont be able to make use of any talent that requires force use.
The give the example of droids that are listed as specifically modified for Darth Vader's lightsaber practice, saying that those droids probably have a few levels of Jedi to make them better with a lightsaber.
The reason for this is that throughout the Expanded Universe, there are numerous examples of people who use lightsabers but are not Jedi.

I think its the other way around. Saga encourages multiclassing, and it is not a bad option either. I have an example that I think can help you with the roleplaying question. In the "After Effects" game here at the site, my character is Force Sensitive, has travelled with a few jedi for a short time, and now he has aquired a lightsaber from one of his fallen allies. I could very well see him taking a jedi level down the road, and since what I would take from it would be WP:Lightsaber and Block, IÂ´d just say the reason is that he has been given lightsaber training by the jedi. Hopefully Rowen will allow it when the time comes.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 16:52:50)

@DarthAnthrax
See, that's a good roleplaying reason. You'd be taking the class because it makes storyline sense (as long as you had another Jedi train you, at least on the side), not just because you want to break the game and be more powerful than the other characters. You didn't, as Breeder complained about, take one level in a class to get those benefits and easily begin taking Jedi to break the system.
@Bob
I can see that happening, and I also think I recall the designers saying that (or something similar), but there are, again, numerous storyline restrictions there. If Vader created droids to specifically duel with him, the might have, in game terms, taken level in Jedi. However, I'm sure they would be restricted against taking Force Powers, since they weren't designed for that. (In the least, the wouldn't be able to take these powers until they became sentient and at least for a level or two). I can see a Jedi character multiclassing to pick up some talents. A negotiator might take some Noble, a warrior might want some soldier, and a "Watchman" or Sith hunter might take some Scout. It's still my opinion that levels in Jedi represent training in Jedi and/or Force arts. While the Jedi Knight prestige class doesn't necessarily say you have to have a certain level in Jedi, I would find it odd that someone with only one level in Jedi would be allowed by the GM to take that PrC.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-17 17:03:18)

the way I see it, there are a few things that can be associated with leveling in jedi:
Lightsaber training: You are given training in Lightsaber combat basics (higher training comes with the Jedi Knight PrC). This is represented by you gaining WP:Lightsabers and access to the Lightsaber combat tree.
Force Training: You have been given training in the Force, but this doesnÂ´t have to be from a jedi. This is represented by gaining the Force Sensitivity feat, and thereby access to most things related to the Force.
Training that fits the talents: If you want your character to have some specific Jedi-class talent (Adept Negotiator, Clear Mind or Dark Side Sense, etc) then of course you takes a level in jedi. This can be a little hard to make roleplaying sense with sometimes, when your character also suddenly gains Lightsaber proficiency or Force Sensitivity, when all he wanted to learn was the Acrobatic Recovery talent that the Jedi Guardians uses. But it can be worked out.

There are no Storyline restrictions on the Jedi class. Jedi Knight and Jedi Master, yes. But not Jedi. As I said, you don't even need to be Force Sensitive to take the Jedi class, but if you're not you can't take/use any talent or ability that requires a UtF check. Nor can you take Force Training.
In the EU there are numerous groups other than the Jedi and the Sith who make use of lightsabers. There are even "Saber Rakes," individuals who use the lightsaber as a Noble's dueling weapon. It's probably safe to say that these characters might have a couple levels of Jedi for some of the talents (Lightsaber Defense....)
The only requirement for either the Jedi Knight/Master or Sith Apprentice/Lord is a story one: Specifically you must be a member of those respective organizations to take the PrC (in addition to any other class prerequisites.) There is no restriction on other classes that you must have, only BAB, talent and other restrictions.
There are also talents that are highly useful to thers as well. A Noble, for example, might want to multiclass to aquire some stuff from the Jedi Consular tree (Adept Negotiator and Master Negotiator anone?) that a Noble might otherwise have.
You are perfectly within your rights to declare the Jedi clas off-linits to all except the Jedi and the Sith in your campaign, however, under the rules as written (and other information from the developers) the class was intended to be taken freely by anyone.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 17:13:32)

I don't think you quite understood me. In the Vader's droids example, they were created with the intent to be good at lightsabering dueling, so they were given levels in Jedi. However, they were not created to use force powers, so maybe they shouldn't get Force Sensitivity (that is, unless they do use the Force. I personally am unfamiliar with them). It could safely be said, I think, that they shouldn't be "allowed," if this were indeed a game, to take Force powers unless the GM did allow them to develop the sentience through experience (leveling up).
I'm fine with taking the class to use the lightsaber better, for instance, but a person suddenly doesn't get Force powers (or access to) just because of it. That's what I meant by restrictions: those between player, GM, and reason.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-17 17:15:38)

those droids canÂ´t get the Force Sensitivity feat at all, no droid can. Thus they can never make UtF checks and never use Force Powers. Maybe it would be allowed for some kind of hybrid-cyborg, but IIRC those droids were just normal droids.

No, actually, from what I've seen, they (Vader's Droids) were Astromech Droids modified to have manipulators that could hold a lightsaber, and with the skills needed to use them.
As far as getting Force Powers go, you don't need the Jedi Class to do that. Anyone who has Force Sensitivity can take Force Training, and also has access to the Alter, Control and Sense trees, as well as potentially the Jensaari tree and Force Witch tree, depending on whether the GM wants to let them have access to them. So, Jedi do not have a monopoly on the force.
You guys seem to be missing the point: Force Sensitivity is NOT a prerequisite of the Jedi class. You do NOT need to be Force Sensitive to take the Jedi class. It has been expressly stated by the game developers that this is so. It has been specifically stated by the Developers that even a Droid can take Jedi, even though it has no ability to aquire the Force Sensitivity feat, and it cannot take the Jedi class at first level, and that no talents or Abilities that require UtF checks can be taken without Force Sensitivity.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-17 17:27:31)

I think you can take talents that requires UtF checks even without the Force Sensitivity feat...as long as you meet all prerequistites.
However, that would be a complete waste, since you canÂ´t make the checks to use them <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

I refer you to page 186, under the heading **Class and Level** and 188, under the heading **Nonliving**:
**Class and Level** "You are 1st level in one heroic class (noble, scoundrel, scout, or soldier) of your choice. You cannot choose the Jedi class."
**Nonliving:** "Droids have no connection to the Force and can't gain the Force Sensitivity feat or learn Force powers."
What this means:
[ul]
[*]A droid cannot start as a Jedi at 1st level, any therefore cannot get Force Sensitivity for free. By association, that means the droid cannot take skill training in Use the Force or take any Force powers.  
[*]The droid is restricted from taking Force Sensitivity throughout its career.  
[*]However, the droid is only banned from taking levels in Jedi at 1st level. No restriction is in place to stop it multiclassing in afterward. Since the Force Sensitivity restriction is still in place, however, the droid is limited to taking Weapon Proficiency [Lightsabers] as its bonus feat for multiclassing.  
[*]Therefore, a lightsaber-wielding training droid would start off in the Soldier class just like any other stock-model battledroid, before being programmed with the unique skillsets required. Or, one built to be proficient from scratch would need to begin life as a 2nd level character.  
[*]Because the droid cannot use Use the Force, any talent relying on the Force cannot be taken (well, it can be taken, but the droid can't use it - its possible, for argument's sake, that they want to take it as a gateway to a talent they CAN use but it would be an expensive price to pay). It has also been suggested by the designers that Mind-Affecting talents should be banned; and of course any talent that specifically calls out it is force-based even if a Use the Force roll isn't used (ex. Force Haze) should be similarly banned. Others may be restricted by the GM if they feel the Force is required (if you were feeling particularly stingy you could make a case against Acrobatic Recovery and Resilience).[/ul]  
The above is also true of non-Force Sensitives, though they can of course choose to later become Force Sensitive and gain access to the skill use, powers, and talents.
Now, the talent list is so severely cut down that there really isn't a great deal to benefit from multiclassing a droid into Jedi. The list of available talents in the core rules has been narrowed down to Acrobatic Recovery, Elusive Target, Resilience, Lightsaber Defense, Weapon Specialization [lightsaber], and Lightsaber Throw (you can throw it, but not get it to return with Use the Force). We can strike Weapon Specialization from the list because a droid could also pick that talent up from a level in Soldier.
Depending on your severity your list may end up shorter. I on the other hand would be a little laxer. My suggestions follow:
[ul]
[*]Skilled Advisor: Though a mind-affecting ability, I don't see Skilled Advisor as being Force-based. A Jedi is simply skilled at communicating quickly, efficiently, and inspiringly. A droid could reasonably be as communicative, and should be able to use their knowledge to assist an ally succeed at a skill check. Note that a droid is immune to mind-affecting effects (pg. 188 under **nonliving**), but it doesn't necessarily follow that they are unable to produce them.  
[*]Block: A droid's computing power should easily equal a Jedi's ability to sense incoming attacks (ex. General Grievous). I would houserule the ability to use Initiative rather than Use the Force in a droid's case, representing their processing speed.  
[*]Deflect: As Block.  
[*]Redirect Shot: As Block. [/ul]

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 23:55:54)

Oh man, breaking out the book on me.
I wasn't completely aware of the droid rules for Force use of the time, so I was merely making an example. The fact that droids don't get Force Sensivity really got in the way of that.
To use the noble duelist example, though, if one takes a level in Jedi just to get advanced lightsaber proficiency, the fact is that Force talents are still open to them, even though they are having nothing to do with the Force. This was my point with "storyline restriction." Such a restriction might not be in the rules, like the Knight and Master prereq's, but you can't deny the GM's ability to restrict choices based on reason.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-18 07:50:41)

Force talents are open to ANYBODY, reverand. The Alter, Control and Sense trees can be taken by anyone who has Force Sensitivity and meets the other prerequisites for the talent. By that logic, the Jedi class is a base class, so why should the talents that it contains be denied to a character who can use the force?
The talents that the Jedi class contains may be different from the ones in the Alter, Control and Sense trees, but I find them no better or worse, nor more or less powerful. They just represent a different focus.
Also, I would like to point out that unlike RCR, Saga has no other force using base classes but Jedi. I would say that it would not be out of the question for any Force User to potentially be of the Jedi class, even without being a mamber of the Jedi Order.
Notice how under the Jedi Knight, Jedi Master, Sith Apprentice and Sith Lord PrC's it lists the specific requirement that the character must be a member of the appropriate order? Well, I'm sure that if the developers had originally intended for the Jedi class to be restricted to certain organizations, it would be specified in the class description.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-18 21:26:18)

Now you're looking at two different talent trees. The general Force talents (Alter, Sense, Control) are not the same thing as the Guardian, Consular, and Sentinel trees from the actual Jedi class.
Let me try to further this example. Unlike last time, I have the book in front of me. Let's say a character takes a level in Jedi to, as said above, further their training with a lightsaber, yet they have no connection to the Force whatsoever (once again, they only wanted to take the level in Jedi to simulate the advanced lightsaber techniques, not become an actual Jedi). They want some of the Lightsaber talents, like Block and Deflect. It would be wrong, then, to say they would be able to take, for instance, Force Intuition (from Guardian) or Dark Side Sense (from Sentinel), at least without some sort of Force training as well.
Once again, I'm perfectly fine with taking the Jedi class to simulate characters non-Jedi Force ability or people who want to be specially trained with a lightsaber or for some situation that calls for it, but since the Jedi class AS A WHOLE is designed with the actual Jedi Order in mind, some adjustments are naturally going to be made, between GM and player.

General Grevious wasn't a droid. He's actually a flesh and blood creature who was at one time a warlord amongst his people but was severely wounded in a battle and underwent extensive cybernetic reconstruction, much like Vader.
reverend: You are perfectly within your rights to force players to modify thier Jedi class to reflect the fact that they are not members of the Jedi Order if you want to. I'm just saying that the rules and erratta as written do not require it.

I'm well aware of that. Fact of the matter is, though, the majority of him is cybernetic/droid parts and he isn't strong in the Force at all. He can only move fast enough to react to blaster bolts thanks to the speed of those electronic parts. He's still a perfectly valid example for the point I'm making. In fact, he rather proves it - if an almost 100% cyborg with an organic mind can react quickly enough, a droid with a superior AI capable of performing millions of calculations per second should easily be able to work out the math required to block and deflect attacks perfectly.

In the movies (which is the most cannonical source) you never actually see Grevious block or deflect any blaster shots. Melee weapons, yes. Not blaster shots.

It doesn't matter whether he did it or not. What matters is whether he was capable, and the movies provided ample evidence that he would be able to. Did you SEE how fast he spun those four sabers at the beginning of the fight with Obi-Wan? As far as I'm concerned he's more than capable of reacting to blasterfire.

His game stats lack Block, Deflect and Redirect, and as far as him spinning those lightsabers goes.... I'd like to point out that he had four of them, and Obi Wan was able to easily penetrate his defenses several times, while Grevious wasn't able to penetrate Obi Wan's at all. That doesn't say much for his ability to block, or deflect.
I would also like to point out that it's possible for anyone to rig up a device to spin at high velocity. Look at a helicopter. That doesn't necessarily mean that said device is going to be any use at deflecting projectiles or melee weapons.
Put another way: If you shoot a helicopter with a handgun from above while the rotor blades are in motion, in all likelyhood your bullet will be deflected. But shoot it from any other angle, and there is no obstruction.

Now you're being unnecessarily obstructive and arguing against points I never even made. I can only assume purely for the sake of arguing. Of course his game stats lack Block, Deflect, and Redirect - By the RAW, it's illegal for him to possess them because he isn't Force-Sensitive. Nor does he need to possess them based on empirical evidence, on that I was never in disagreement. What I was saying is that *extrapolating from what is known of Grievous*, I believe he would be capable of using the talents if he had them despite his lack of Force-Sensitivity.
All I originally wanted to do was suggest a case for houseruling the talents to be used by droids, and this has gone way off topic simply because you disagreed with me grouping Grievous with droids - which he is for all intents and purposes, as far as I'm concerned. I know you disagree. I'm fairly sure you'll continue to disagree after I've posted this. But being disagreeable is no way to win me over to your opinion and the continuation of this "debate" will accomplish nothing. Aside from that, the conversation is entirely tangential to the original purpose of Breeder's thread. Ironic given he created it to stop himself derailing threads created by others. Let's have it end here.

Thanks, by the way.  I just kinda checked in on this thread today, and noticed that it was a quite a bit larger than I left it.
Not only was these two lines well put, but they made me laugh.  Irony *is* funny.
