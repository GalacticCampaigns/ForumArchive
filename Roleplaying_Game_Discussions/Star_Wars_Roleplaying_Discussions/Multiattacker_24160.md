# Multiattacker

Hey everyone, IÂ´d like to check with you what kind of experiences youÂ´ve had playing melee-based characters using Full Attack actions. I havenÂ´t tried it before, so I thought IÂ´d try it out. The character is a Jedi, but he has the Devastating Attack talent and Unleashed feat, which made me very curious about the potential of using Unleashed Charge, and also Unleashed Devastating Attack, which seems to combo well with multiattackers.
The Withdraw action seems to be a pain in the a** for this kind of character, but I was thinking of using the Mobile Combattant talent to fix that somewhat, and it seems like it could be a good help. Anyone who has any experiences?
Generally I was thinking of taking up to DWM II, Double Attack(Lightsabers), Multiattack Proficiencyx1 and either Attack Combo(Melee) or Savage Attack(Lightsabers), though IÂ´m leaning towards Attack Combo. Thoughts, ideas, suggestions, experiences?
For the record, IÂ´ll probably use Dark Rage(with Force Point) quite a lot for important fights, and I was thinking of taking Improved Battle Strike as my first Force Technique, so IÂ´m not overly worried about not getting away all the penalties from multiattacking.

There are talents for the Melee Duelist class that let you take a full attack action as a Standard.
I'd also like to point out that the requirements have been Errata to require "Weapon Focus: Any melee Weapon" so its easier for Jedi to qualify

Hmm, yeah, thatÂ´s an interesting option. I think it is a little requiring for the character I had in mind, but still nice. I am curious however as to whether or not it would be usable with a Double-Bladed lightsaber.

Well, IÂ´ve now got hold of the Jedi Academy manual, and figured an even better way to output several attacks per round.
How does the Saber Swarm + Fluid Riposte + Djem So + Unleashed Devastating Attack combo sound? All with the addition of Dark Rage bonuses as well.
