# Variant Rule: Skill Focus (Utf) Break Down

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-20 20:03:53)

I've read several threads over at the WOTC boards of GMs complaining about how 'imbalanced' a Force-user with Skill Focus (UtF) is. Now, personally, I think the main problem lies in both the GM's encounter-crafting ability (ex. putting every opponent within one Force Slam cone) and their player's meta-game thinking ("With my 1st-level Utf +12, I'd already be a Force powerhouse!").
However, I do also realize the opposite: that despite how well-crafted an encounter can be, some are still far too easily solved with the right combination of powers and a boosted Utf skill (ex. A level 1 Jedi uses Search Your Feelings to see if Mind Tricking the Stormtrooper will work in their favor, then uses Mind Trick when the answer is yes, or Force Slam if the answer is no.). On the other hand, if players wants to play a "Force Master", I know (and contend) that they should always be given the opportunity to do so.
Given this problem, here's my variant rule idea:
**Skill Focus (Utf) Break Down**
1) Keep Use the Force as a single skill, thereby needing only training (either at character creation or Skill Training) to get the initial +5 bonus, as well as keeping it gradually increased through the bonus from a character's heroic level.
2) Break down Skill Focus (Utf) into the three main Force descriptors, like they are in the Force Talents: SF (Alter), SF(Control) and SF(Sense). The Force Powers, the freebie powers under Utf, and those 'powers' granted by Force Talents will then have one of these descriptors, as appropriate.
The end effect of this is that a character with only one of these Skill Focus feats will still get their +10 bonus for Utf when making any Force-related action with the same descriptor, but only a +5 bonus when making any Force-related action with one of the other descriptors. Should a character want to truly "Master the Force", they would need to take Skill Focus three times.
Mechanically speaking, I believe this would better represent each Jedi's specialization, and better defines a Master of the Force's dedication to the study rather than a single Skill Focus (Utf).

This is an idea that could work. ItÂ´s something of a middle-ground between the huge generalisation of Saga and the extreme specialisation in RCR.

Hm. 1 feat is too few IMO, but 3 feats feels like too many. But I can't see a good of way of dividing the Force into 2 categories. Ultimately, it seems no solution will be perfect.

Perhaps a split between the "Physical" and the "Spiritual" effects of the force? Things that either manipulate or alter something, or someone, physically would fit in the former category, while abilities and powers that effect the mind, senses, or other intangibles of the Force go with the latter?

The problem with such a dichotomy is that, as SW material indicates, the "Spiritual" aspects of the Force would greatly outweigh the "Physical" aspects, as there are far more mental and sensual applications of the Force than physical ones, and far more situations where these "Spiritual" aspects will be useful for. Physical aspects, while numerous, tend to be useful mostly during combat, and even then it's usually a show of the same applications over and over.
Granted, that with a three-way split as I suggested, one probably outweighs the other two individually, but I would rather have a 1-in-3 imbalance rather than a 1-in-2. Game design-wise, the 1-in-2 imbalance often results in a 'no-brainer' choice, akin to houseruling Block and Deflect as a single Talent.
However, if there *were* a way to equitably split Force applications into two, I would certainly prefer it for simplicity's sake.

The biggest issue that comes from Skill Focus: Use the Force is the massive usefulness of the skill. You use in every time you are attacked. You can use it to make perception checks, to activate any force power, to pilot, etc. It's an awesome skill, and can be an all in one toolkit. They only way to make it any better is to let is take the place of Acrobatics.
Slitting into three seems like a good idea, to me. Mind you, I am all for anything that will slice a bit of the power people attribute to Jedi and other Force Users. But it's the break down of the Force powers and Talents that worry me. Does Deflection fall under Sense, or Control? Each Focus needs to be carefully balanced so you don't get every Jedi taking Skill Focus: Use the Force (alter). It shoudl be a difficult choice, if one looks at the power levels.
But, these are my thoughts, and nothing more

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-11-24 08:42:49)

HereÂ´s an example of how I would imagine the breakdown to be:
[hide]Control
Clear Mind
Block
Deflect
Force Focus
Force Pilot
Battle Strike
Dark Rage
Negate Energy
Rebuke
Surge
Force Trance
Sense
Force Intuition
Dark Side Sense
Force Perception
Gauge Force Potential
Farseeing
Search YourFeelings
Sense Force
Sense Surroundings
Telepathy
Alter
Force Persuasion
Force Haze
Lightsaber Throw
Force Disarm
Force Grip
Force Lightning
Force Slam
Force Stun
Force Thrust
Mind Trick
Move Object
Sever Force
Vital Transfer
Charm Beast
Flight (Maybe Control)
Force Treatment
Force Deception
Move Light Object[/hide]
As usual though, I havenÂ´t tried to balance it at all, just separated them as it makes sense to me.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-11-24 10:28:21)

Should a few powers be a mix of two or all three spheres of the Force? Ya know, Flight Requiring both Skill Focus (control) and Skill Focus (alter)? I think old, old version of Star Wars had that, but I'm for sure on it.
My way of thinking is no, that this break down us just fine. But the thought tickled my brain and I figured I would share.

This is an interesting take, and I like your idea.
Personally, I don't have a problem with the UtF (Use the Force) Skill, and I understand a lot of the concerns, but I haven't seen any real abuse yet. I know skill focusing in UtF and then grabbing the other Jedi talents that emulate the skills seems wrong, but hey they are spending a talent for a skill. Heck, go ahead because talents are invaluable and you don't get them in the prestige classes either. If you want a skill that bad, then blow your talent.
I don't see a problem with the focus affecting everything. I'm more concerned how players use them, how often, and if they are being abusive. If you running a lightside campaign you always have darkside points to punish players. If a player wants to abuse the skill, then there are consequences. This is why a Jedi is suppose to be hard to play. Ya they are all powerful, but they have a code. If your playing a darkside campaign then I think its even more fun to let them abuse the powers. Let the characters do whatever, that's the beauty of evil and embracing the quest for power.
The only problem I have seen so far is that a lot of players want to play Jedi, and because of the broad use of the UtF skill they can be good at almost anything. I think this is the main topic everyone is discussing. That is why there are era's and the GM can put Jedi limitations on the party. It could go that other way, It could be an all Jedi party. If that is the case, then I think you need them to have the broad skill use to survive. I know Breeder and I were talking about this and we were going in circles, but it still comes down to one thing. Its an RPG and if you want to play a Jedi you should be able too, and if you don't want anything to do with the force then should be able too and it doesn't matter who can do what, but how much fun you have playing. Yes I know the mechanics of the game seem to favor classes, but the game is young and we are going to see all kinds of non-Jedi books come out that are going to hopefully bring balance to the game.

My main issue isn't a Jedi trading a bunch of talents for a bunch of skills, it's a Jedi (or other Force User) trading just one talent for one skill. Basically, you can create almost any non-force using archetype you want, and there is a Jedi out there who is just as good at your chosen role- if not better- and also has full base attack, great combat talents and feats, wonderful hit points, cinematic cool powers, and the best melee weapon in the game. Why *not* play a Jedi?
Unfortunately, this rule doesn't help that area; a Force based pilot easily equals or exceeds a mundane pilot quite easily, as does a negotiator, and so on. This change encourages niche focusing, which does nothing for what I am complaining about.
This is great, however, for a full jedi party. It forces niches to be formed, and everyone can easily get a role they will be better than the rest of the crew, which is awesome. In that case, this is elegant, and smooth. For those games, I intend to use this rule all over the place.

I donÂ´t really get this. If a Jedi/Force-User takes Training/Focus:UtF and then grabs the Force Pilot talent for example, then he has a +10 to his Pilot checks and can use "trained-only" stuff. If another character takes Training/Focus in Pilot, he gets the same, but he has a talent to spare, that he can use on something that improves his piloting skills, maybe Spacehound, Dev.Attack(Heavy) or Hyperdriven, depending on class.
Same goes for a negotiator. The Jedi has to spend two talents to get Force Persuasion (I admit that Adept Negotiator isnÂ´t bad though), and get Training/Focus in UtF. A non-Force-User gets Training/Focus in Persuasion, and again has the same uses of the skill, with the ability to take talents that improves them.
I think this is one reason Jedi only gets 2+INT skills at 1st level.

Exactly, Darth. Breeder, you're really overstating the abilities of a Force-user. Sure, they can be as good at something as a non-Forcie. And if they take the right talents they can be about as good in terms of skill use as their entire party combined. But it will be at the cost of not being **great** at much, thanks to all those talents they spent.
I've just checked through the book and the only Force-based talent that helps a pilot build is Force Pilot. I can imagine Foresight being useful, but it requires Force Perception which is a sink for the build. Force Pilot, as stated, costs a talent to at best make the Jedi an equally skilled pilot to a mundane pilot. The non-Jedi will be able to take a Spacer talent and get an actual perk.
A negotiator build has more options - Force Perception and Force Persuasion, of course. Again, these cost a talent each to make the Jedi an equally skilled negotiator to a mundane negotiator, talents a non-Jedi could spend on more useful things like Presence and Demand Surrender. Adept Negotiator and Master Negotiator arguably make a Jedi a better negotiator, but only if they *work*. If a Noble and a Jedi went up against each other in negotiations, the Noble could still easily come out on top thanks to an excellent Will Defense.
Note that in both builds, the character will probably *need* to take at least one talent that substitutes Use the Force for another skill - As Darth pointed out, Jedi get the least amount of trained skills.

Jedi also get full base attack bonus, the best hit die, and force powers (including force trance, move light object, search your feelings, sinse force, sense surroundings, and telepathy). In a game where attack bonuses are hard to come by while defense bonuses soar, BAB is nothing to sneeze at. Hit points don't matter as much, but it sure doesn't help. Plus, since their Force powers would use the same attribute as their (other) area of focus, you get that beanie.
Scoundrels have access to Spacehound and Hyperdriven, but are stuck with a 3/4 BAB. That -5 modifier to star ship weapons goes away fairly quickly even if the Jedi never takes star ship weaponry (which would be rare for a dedicated pilot). Hyperdriven grants once a day bonus to a single check, which is nice, but limited. Force Adepts, Jedi Knights, and Sith apprentices can get Force Point recovery, which is a *lot* better (though not so easily gained).
Remember multi-classing, and how Saga makes it easier. Take your Jedi negotiator, and cross her into noble. Now she has access to all those noble talents and feats, plus she'll have Mind Trick, Vital Transfer, Negate Energy and Move Object once per encounter. And the noble would...have a little bit more money. In a setting that glosses over monetary items.
So, in the end, you have one of the best combat guys in the game, with equal skill in a niche his mundane counterpart has, plus has all kinds of Force powers to boot.

But Jedi will never be as skilled as anyone else (few trained skills), and they are supposed to be high in BaB and Hp (as a combat class). And if we talk about Jedi who start their career in another class, they take a hit to mainly starting Hp (unless Soldier), and has to buy either Force Sensitivity or WGP:Lightsabers as a feat.

The Scoundrel has become equal to the Jedi in piloting, and he is plus one talent. He can now decide wether to spend it on becoming an even better pilot, or o something else completely. And since Hyperdriven can be used even after you know the result of the check, it can really be more than nice for a "pure" Scoundrel of a decent level.

An in order to take "all" those talents and feats, he has to sacrifice his good BaB and Hit Dice. A Noble can get all those things quicker, and it "costs" her less.

And his mundane counterpart will likely have several other areas that he is better in. Â¨Sorry, I donÂ´t see the problem here.
