# Backgrounds

### **Sketchpad** (2009-04-28 15:20:45)

I was working on a campaign idea today and started thinking about Backgrounds. Paizo and 3e both use them to help flesh out player characters and I was wondering if people had used them in Star Wars at all? I know Tao's site started working on them ... but there always seemed space for quite a few. Anyone have any opinions?

I tend to use backgrounds, in a way at least. I like to use backgrounds to give my players secret traits that affects them in minor ways, both for good and bad. But I mainly uses backgrounds to work with their destinies, and also to find new plot hooks in.

They're in 4e in the PHB2. They mostly give you a training in a skill or two. FR has them naturally by region.
I think that Saga covered the concept pretty well with the Destiny mechanic, by giving you bonuses by working in tandem with your destiny. How would they work exactly? A human born on Tatooine would be able to resist sandstorms or extreme heat better?
