Anybody pick it up yet?
I did today, and I gotta say that so far I like it. New traits and abilities that, for example, make Jedi *Battle Meditation* a talent worth taking. New talents, new alternate Force Traditions with Talent Trees, new weapons, equipment, starships and rules for lightsaber crystals. It even has a couple of new Jedi traditions in it. Some Mandalorian stuff, new PrC's, including Corporate Agent, Gladiator and Melee Duelist. All in all a well rounded book.
