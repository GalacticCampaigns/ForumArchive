# Vibro Longsword.

### **ganthet** (2007-10-20 13:31:30)

Here is something I found on the Wizards forums it is stats for a vibro longsword. from Pint Glass Crusader.
Damage: 2D8 [slashing]
Type: Advanced Melee [medium]
Weight: 2kg
Availabilty: military
Cost: 1200cr
Seldom produced any more, due to the substantial manufacturing costs, and slim profit margins. The Vibro-sword is seen more as a status symbol than a front-line weapon. Still, those who would style themselves as military leaders, value them for their status as well as their defensive capabilities.
The part I do not agree with is the cost and the fact they are not manufactured that much. If they are going to make vibro axes, blades, knives. Then they would produce a sword. The cost should be less, at least 700 to 800 credits. What do you think.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-20 13:36:20)

I also do not agree with them being military for grade. I don't see the military useing these for anything other then for show. The reason for the smaller price is unless you are wanting it to be mastercrafted, you are not going to pay alot.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-20 15:44:46)

I'd agree it doesn't have to be military. It should fall in licensed or restricted with the rest of the vibro weapons. The vibro ax is restricted. I'd go with restricted for the the vibro long sword. It isn't used much for actual battle anymore, but people don't want you walking into their cantina with a giant vibro sword.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-20 15:49:17)

As for price, the vibro ax (a large vibro weapon) costs 500 credits. I'd say that's about right for the sword as well.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-21 05:19:04)

I think we are going to see an equipment book, that should expand on the weapons. Lots of star wars miniatures have swords, can the very well could be vibro. I think any melee weapon should be about to be a vibro weapon.
I agree with what you both said. Restricted, 500 credits.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-21 06:04:14)

not every melee weapon has to be a vibro weapon. There are several species in the galaxy who has unique melee weapons (Wookies, Zabraks, Cereans...) that arenÂ´t vibro.
I agree with the rest, 500cr and restricted sounds about right.
On a sidenote though, is there any stats for powered melee weapons in Saga yet? I know vibro weapons uses energy cells, but I was thinking more of weapons like [this](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darksword "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darksword").

I haven't seen any stats for it around the net. Easy enough to stat out though. Blocks lightsaber attacks the same as cortosis, but without scrambling effect and with a specific charge.
I'd give it the same damage as a vibro sword from what little I've read. It is a powered sword after all. I'd give it a charge similar to a blaster's ammunition. Something like 50 charges. Whether those charges are only spent when striking lightsabers, or every strike is up to you. Not sure what powers it, but there should be someway to recharge it.

### **ganthet** (2007-10-21 13:35:32)

There is some on the wizards forums and you might check at Tao's site but ather then that I don't know. The reason that I brought this up was because I want to see this weapon get used. I think it would be cool to build a character that use a sword in the game. Don't you?

agreed to that. when I created my character I wanted him mainly be a pistol-wielder, but to have a nice longsword as backup. but I only found a shortsword... :

### **Anazider** (2007-10-21 14:30:54)

I think the charge on the darksword doesn't refer to it being a powered weapon, but that it had a light to it or something to that effect.
To that effect, I would make it so that the Darksword could resist a lightsaber, and that its damage reduction counted against the lightsaber's blade, to account for its resiliency but eventually being broken.

Yeah, they have similar power levels/damage potential.

That I'm not keen on. A lightsaber doesn't have charges, and neither does a vibrosword, both of which require energy to operate in the form of an energy cell. So why should a powered weapon be any different? I think if an energy cell is enough to operate a sword of pure energy, it should be more than enough for a powered weapon.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-22 00:41:40)

I agree with simply on this there should be no charges.

Because you have to connote the degradation of the dark sword somehow. And I never said power cell. I'm not really sure how you power a dark sword. Dark force energy? The charges is only an easy way to keep track of said degradation. I chose 50 because it seems to balance out with most blaster pistols. It was just a quick and dirty way of mocking one up. Once charges run out lightsabers (maybe vibro weapons) can shatter it. The DR suggestion might be better for the dark sword, but I haven't put much thought into possible merits/flaws.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-22 00:46:35)

What is this dark sword you are talking about?

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-22 01:00:09)

I think on its face the DR suggestion would work better and more clean. I only see two problems. It seems less like degradation of the power source of the dark sword and more like a powerful blow that sunders the weapon. Second, if you statted out the Darth Maul duel mentioned in the above and all Darth Maul had to contend with was a DR he would have shattered it on the first strike or block. Even at that point in time Maul would have been a one man wrecking crew when it comes to that sword. Even with a fairly high DR. A good strike against it would shatter the damn thing. Which again goes back to the whole are we just really smashing these dark swords or is their protective energy waning over time?

See Darth Anthrax's post halfway up the thread.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-22 01:10:42)

Would say in the case of the Dark Sword that it's capableity to with stand the lightsaber could have a set amount. after it is used up it is just a regular Mastercrafted Vibro Sword. You might even have it make a save after so many hits in a row like a 50/50 chance that it might break.

If you wanted to emulate an effect such as holding up to a lighsaber for a limitied time then give the Darksword a SR rating vs lightsabers, let's say a SR rating of 25 and each time the damage would break the SR rating subtract 5 until it can't hold anymore, then to break the sword the lighsaber can deal damage to the hit points of the sword since it would go through the DR. Since lightsabers go through DR you would have to adopt the SR rule.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 05:10:28)

what IÂ´m concerned about though is how you would determine when the two swords actually clash? I could see it being done every time the saber-wielder uses Block, but otherwise I think thereÂ´s no clear way to say. One way to do it could be to adopt the [Parry talent](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=78 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=78")that I made up (found under Melee Combat)

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-22 05:14:46)

That's a good point. I would say it will hold up indefinitely unless the attacker sunders or attack the object being held or the defender blocks using the Block ability.
Your parry ability is nice.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 05:23:32)

> That&#39;s a good point. I would say it will hold up indefinitely unless the attacker sunders or attack the object being held or the defender blocks using the Block ability.
> Your parry ability is nice.

ThatÂ´s the thing really. IÂ´ve only seen a darksword used in that particular duel, but I canÂ´t really think of Darth Maul actually striking to sunder and not to kill. An Mighella also canÂ´t use Block, since she doesnÂ´t have a lightsaber. So unless a rule is adopted to allow melee combattants to block with thei weapons, maybe you could say that the sword has 50 charges or something and that everytime a lightsaber attack misses you one charge is drained? I know itÂ´s not really balanced when a missed attack can just as well have been dodged as parried, but it could be fair if you say the sword has 50 charges, when in reality it could really only take around 10 blows or so

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-22 05:25:07)

I would think that the darksword for purposes of blocking and deflecting would work as a lightsaber. Well, that's what I would do.
50 attacks seems like a long combat.. hehe missed or not.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-22 11:27:14)

Assumeing these are artifacts you find they are not going to have full charges on there SR anyway so you woul have to determn how long the sword would hold out to a lightsaber.
Another question is what if you have a sword or vibrosword made a baskar, Mandalorian Iron. It is supposed to stand up to a lightsaber how would you do that?

IÂ´d just let them retain their DR against lightsabers

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-22 13:14:38)

So what you are saying is you would let it have a DR agaisnt lightsabers.
I would just let it stop them. I mean why not there is going to be things out there that a lightsaber is not going to cut throw. Of course if you gave it a DR You would have to figure out how many hit points the sword would have before it broke, and it's AC.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 13:33:57)

well, the best way to represent a material being able to not be cut in two when connecting to a lightsabers blade is to say they retain their DR against a lightsaber. those metals would probably have more DR and Hp than most (IIRC Mandalorian Iron is one of the strongest substances presented in the SECR).
But if one is going to take this kind of ruling to the next level you need to better be able to tell when a missed lightsaber attack is actually *parried* as opposed to *dodged*. Currently, the only way to damage an object is to attack it directly, the rules doesnÂ´t cover damage from the small parries that are part of reflex defense, just as they donÂ´t cover weapons being damaged when the Block talent is used against them.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-22 13:38:23)

So unless you try to sunder the sword it would hold up. The DR and hit points would only apply if this happened?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 13:47:27)

thatÂ´s how I read the rules

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 13:51:11)

one thing you could do though, is houserule that you take a -1 oenalty to attack rolls and reflex defense when fighting in melee with lightsaber wielder (due to the fact that you cant fight as you normally would). You could then choose to ignore the penalties but then you suffer a chance to have your weapon damaged everytime you misses your opponent or he misses you (to account for the probability that you/he parried that attack). If you had a weapon that can withstand a lightsabers blade (another saber, or something made of Phrik, Cortoisis or Mando Iron for example), you would not suffer the penalties, and if your opponent attacks your weapon directly, it retains DR.
only problem is that this adds another die roll (to determine if your weapon was damaged), and unnecessary complexity.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-22 16:08:49)

The SR would work quite well, however a lightsaber isn't just a sword. It's a steady beam of focused energy. Every time the "blade" touches something it damages it. So ever time Maul or his opponent block strikes its damaging the sword. Since their isn't a DR roll it wouldn't damage the sword, which isn't what is described in the Maul duel.
If charges are used 50 is good, as long as the ay to charge it is difficult. I was assuming there is no power cell, etc. You'd have to charge it with force points or hp or something else. It is a dark sword after all...That expense would make those 50 points seem very precious, and keep someone from hacking away at every maintenance guy they meet on the death star.
I think both the charge and the SR have merit and should somehow be combined as already wisely suggested.

The penalty is interesting, and I can see the merits of it. However, isn't the fact the PC is dueling a Jedi who is already strong as hell enough punishment? What about the penalty of having the lightsaber go through their blocking sword and head like butter because they didn't spring for cortosis? I think it only adds more to the already steep penalties. I mean they can't block a single attack!
Don't be so mean... :

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 16:14:18)

I wasnÂ´t saying it was a fair way of doing it, just that it was a way :

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 16:53:21)

but how about this? anytime a melee attack misses by 5 or less, itÂ´s considered to be "parried", and the attacker automatically makes an attack against the defenders weapon.
In the case of saber vs saber, this wouldnÂ´t be an issue, as the sabers canÂ´t destroy each other. In the case of saber vs any other weapon, the saber would simply ignore DR for the other weapon (except for the already mentioned materials). In the case of other weapon vs other weapon, I think it could be even.
I donÂ´t think there needs to be rules for it, but I agree that an advantage for saber vs non-saber in melee is realistic for star wars

LOL, that is DarthAnthrax new quote.
The SR idea was just off the top of my head, but let me get down to the Saga book and an example of this Darksword you are describing.
First we have to realize that not everything in the comics, books, and movies and be translated to game mechanics. Also, I have not read the actual battle and can not interpret the combat motions and translate them to Saga game mechanics.
Consider the Electrostaff, and advance melee weapon. The staff is made of a resilient phrik alloy that gives it DR 20; this damage reduction applies even against lightsabers.
We all saw the movies, no Jedi ever sundered an electrostaff. They are charged by ordinary energy cells, nothing fancy.
So, maybe Maul did sunder the weapon with a couple of power attacks which destroyed the darksword. For simplicity I would use the electrostaff as your guide line.
Heres and idea:
If the Darksword is an artifact like I heard someone mention, then have the sword use a lightsaber cyrstal or special material that can be charged with a Force Point. As long as a force user wields the sword make a Use the Force check DC (whatever) to activate the charge.
Or you could just have this Darksword have the DR permanant in anyones hands. If I knew more about the history of the Darksword, origins and such I could come up with something better.
Bottom line, it should have DR, it can hold up to lightsabers, and can only be destroyed by being attacked overcoming the DR and hit points. It works, better than the SR because like DarthAntrax said , you can't know when the attack is actually being hit by the lightsaber.
Those are just my final thoughts.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-23 06:41:23)

well Maul certainly could have destroyed the weapon even with itÂ´s DR intact. It just seems so not Maul to use "advanced" moves like sundering :P , but he does use some disarming ealier in that comic.
guess weÂ´ll just leave it at that to avoid unnecesary complication

Remember a longsword is just that: pretty long. At least three feet (usually four) of steel. A short sword is a better *back-up* weapon.
But a weapon to look dashing with? Long (vibro) sword is the way to go.

Me, personally, I think the Jedi have a high enough advantage in melee combat without them getting the Sunder/super-disarm feat for free. Too much of this (auto-sunder melee weapons that aren't lightsabers) and it would be completely pointless to go melee with Jedi, instead of just a really, really bad idea. The game will devolve into a jedi, and a bunch of people shooting at him. Very boring. My opinion is to leave the (melee) combat (mostly) as is.
If I recall correctly, Samurai and the like never parried when they sword fought, that it was a purely western thing for a long time. And what little martail arts I took, there were plenty of examples of getting out of the way of the sharp pokey thing instead of trying to stop/parry it.

No, really, guys, you all said some interesting stuff. Not just **DarthAnthrax**. Honest. He is just, ah...well...today is his day for interesting stuff.
> not every melee weapon has to be a vibro weapon. There are several species in the galaxy who has unique melee weapons (Wookies, Zabraks, Cereans&#8230;) that arenÂ´t vibro.

First, I agree here. I love cool melee weapons that aren't just lightsabers. But to keep up with damage, one needs to add a little something extra. A 1d6 club is kinda silly in the face of a 2d10 vibro-axe. So, the cannon way of making things 'better' is to slap that vibro prefix on it.
> On a sidenote though, is there any stats for powered melee weapons in Saga yet? I know vibro weapons uses energy cells, but I was thinking more of weapons like [this](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darksword "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darksword").

For the Dark Sword, I would be inclined to treat it as a normal longsword in anoyone hands that isn't force sensitive, and a vibro-sword in the hands of some one who is. It should keep it's DR vs. lightsabers, and not worry about the degrading effects; since a club is not instantly sheared by a lightsaber, neither should this.
Personally, I think when the lady broke her dark sword, it was because she rolled two natural ones in a row, and the GM was pissed at the player.

well if you quote me a lot, itÂ´s just because I tend to ramble out a lot ofd things when I get worked up, so thereÂ´s a lot to quote :P
But I agree with you, this was just a thought on how it could be done, but personally IÂ´ll just leave melee the way it is. And while I agree that getting out of a sword way is the preferrable thing to do, thereÂ´s a lot of techniques that are based on parrying your opponents blade and then work with it

Tangent: Yeah, Samurai rarely parried. That was largely due to their fighting style, in which the first strike was usually the last one. If the first strike didn't finish the fight and a Samurai had to parry they couldn't use the edge of their blade, which was too soft, and had to turn the sword to parry with the hardened back side. If they could, it was easier for them to evade the attack instead.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-10-28 00:00:18)

My point was that Samurai were well known for their fighting prowess, especially with their (mystical) swords. So are Jedi. Thus, my stance that just because you have a lightsaber in a sword fight, you don't auto-sunder the other guys weapon.
Though, I will admit, I am not the expert on Samurai, sword fighting, or even Star Wars.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-29 07:39:04)

As I said, I donÂ´t think that auto-sunder would be a fair ruling.
On the other hand, when you have a weapon that can most likely cut through another ones weapon, I think you begins to *seek* more options to parry rather than avoid hit attacks

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-30 08:16:04)

On the wizards boards the whole lightsaber vs normal melee weapons came up.
It was hard for a lot of people to accept a normal weapon being used against a lightsaber, and not being destroyed.
Most posts said that parrying was not going on as much as dodging and avoiding blows. Think about it, If I didn't have my normal weapon drawn my defense doesn't change.If I am using Martial Arts my arms and legs aren't getting severed every attack. So why are people thinking the weapon being wielded against a lightsaber is the target of all the attacks.
Then people countered, but if you did parry why isn't the weapon destroyed or damaged.
We have already discussed this, and its simple. You can't know when the weapons clash in battle. This is done for simplicity. We don't want to describe every combat maneuver we are trying pull off every second.
Materials have DR's, and a few have DR's that stand up to lightsabers, but when a lightsaber hits something (and we see it in the movies) it doesn't always destroy it and break it in two pieces. Granted most of the time it does. Sometimes we just see sparks fly. If we stretch our thinking a little, it is possible to accept that a normal weapon can hold up fine in a battle. We can't try to make everything we read translate into Game mechanics, we just work with what is available.
Basically what I'm trying to say in a nutshell is.
You have to target the weapon, item, object or what ever to do damage. Otherwise you are not trying to overcome its DR and hit points Because if your saying that lightsabers should automatcally damage any weapon that can't stand resist, then every melee battle is a problem. Now all melee weapons would be taking damage from battles, and who's to say that my power attack wasn't parried that round, I could have very well destroyed your weapon with sheer damage and strength.
BTW I'm not targeting any comments, these are just my final thoughts on the subject.

> On the wizards boards the whole lightsaber vs normal melee weapons came up.
> It was hard for a lot of people to accept a normal weapon being used against a lightsaber, and not being destroyed.
> Most posts said that parrying was not going on as much as dodging and avoiding blows. Think about it, If I didn&#39;t have my normal weapon drawn my defense doesn&#39;t change.If I am using Martial Arts my arms and legs aren&#39;t getting severed every attack. So why are people thinking the weapon being wielded against a lightsaber is the target of all the attacks.
> Then people countered, but if you did parry why isn&#39;t the weapon destroyed or damaged.
> We have already discussed this, and its simple. You can&#39;t know when the weapons clash in battle. This is done for simplicity. We don&#39;t want to describe every combat maneuver we are trying pull off every second.
> Materials have DR&#39;s, and a few have DR&#39;s that stand up to lightsabers, but when a lightsaber hits something (and we see it in the movies) it doesn&#39;t always destroy it and break it in two pieces. Granted most of the time it does. Sometimes we just see sparks fly. If we stretch our thinking a little, it is possible to accept that a normal weapon can hold up fine in a battle. We can&#39;t try to make everything we read translate into Game mechanics, we just work with what is available.

Well said, this is actually my own thoughts on the matter as well. What I have been doing in this thread though, is to try and come up with viable solutions (viable, not fair : ) for those who wants some more ruling on this area. The thing that prevents any such ruling from being easy is exactly the fact that we donÂ´t know when weapons clash in melee combat.
If I may, I would like to add some comments based on real-life martial arts training: It may seem that any wodden weapon is bound to get shattered by the edge of a katana in combat, but a lot of our sword-vs-staff training is based on using the staff to parry in such a way that the sword just slides of and not damages the staff.

Here is a thought: Skilled users of a weapon will keep said weapon from being struck in such a way it will be broken. Unskilled users then to just toss their weapon in the way of a strike and hope that stops the incoming strike. Using this idea, you could rule that against a lightsaber wielder, some one not proficient in the weapon they are using suffers an attack on his weapon with each missed strike. Low level thugs would lose their weapons quick, but your dual vibro-axe wielding chop-chop bad boy is free and clear.
Personally, though, I like the way it's listed in the book. I don't like all the book, but I do like most parts of it, and this part is one of them.

Okay DarthAnthrax I have an idea for you then <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
**New Talent:**
***Sundering Strike:*** When you deal damage with a lightsaber that would over come your target opponents weapons hit points, after DR is applied (if applicable, ie weapons like the electrostaff) that he/she is wielding in combat, you may choose to use this talent. Instead of dealing damage to your opponent you target his/her weapon dealing half damage to the weapon.
Its a twist of Severing Strike, but applied to weapons. You give up dealing damage to your opponent and attack the weapon, this works good for intimidating opponents and not bringing any bodily harm. Maybe its expensive as a talent because you can sunder for free, but attacking a held object is much harder. Reflex Defense 10 + the object's size modifier + the Reflex Defense of the holder (not counting armor bonus or natural armor bonus, if any), This talent would knock off the Reflex Defense + 10, and make sundering weapons easier in combat for lightsaber wielders.
You can even take this a step further, and just add Sundering Strike as an option to Severing Strike, that way you don't waste a talent and it seems fitting.

Interesting Idea there. I never had any idea that this would generate this much stuff I started out wanting to know what people thought then everyone just went crazy and there has been some interesting ideas come out of it. I like the parry talent idea and the the sundering strike talent idea. Keep it up.
I think that if you are using a regualar Vibrosword it will be destroyed by a lightsaber with in the frist hit. Now some the ideas like the, Dark blade, Mando Iron, some of the Wookie blades that I have seen in storys and games should be able to stand up to a saber with no problem. I am not trying to lessen the lightsaber in any way, I think there should be a weapon that a soldier, scoundrel or any other class can wheld that can stand up to it. Just my opionion is all.
