# For all the number crunchers out there

I have a question for all you number crunching folks out there. Does Saga have a basic formula to balance its game mechanic's? In other words how do they make sure balance is maintained during character advancement (I know some will say Jedi are OPed.......Breeder I'm looking at you!), or with weapons or the various skill ups you can obtain?
Honestly has anyone figured it out?

Darn good question. I just compared a few numbers and got nothing... yet. But, summer vacation's here next week. Time to let my brain grow weeds and use the power for Star Wars and such. ;D

I don't think they used a formula, but one could be built. Craft some of x+y-z, and you end up with something cardboard and stiff. Role playing games need more free form, methinks.
They way they (tried) to balance the game, methinks, is give a series of steady increases in several areas, and allowed each class access to only a few areas. Take the attack bonus; everyone gets one, and you'd have to work hard to get a useless one. Most areas of the game increase at a set rate: Hit points, defense, skills, feats, and talents. Even multi-classing doesn't provide a greater benefit or penalty. With this mix-and-match style, there are breaks in the system, but that kind of thing will happen no matter what.
The only glaring unbalance (shut it, Rowan. You knew this was coming) is the Force powers. Outside of a few, you can pick up any of these powers at any level. The potency isn't controlled, just the number of uses. A good comparison is taking two equal level soldiers and giving one a three shot rocket launcher, and then saying "it's okay. It only has three shots in it".
But, to the original point, I don't see a formula. I do see a few places bench marks could be set for each level, such as skills and attacks, but no straight number crunching.
Again, me, my thoughts, and the evilness of the wielders of the glowy sticks of death.

I donÂ´t think they had any kind of formula, nor do I think any such formula can be made, at least not one that is in any way good. If youÂ´ve seen *Numbers* on TV, you might understand why.
As for the Force, I donÂ´t think they broke it completely, but it is quite overpowered at lower levels, as Skill Focus(Use the Force) gives such a high skill modifier, The best examples are Block/Delflect and Force Grip combined with Skill Focus(Use the Force) at 1st level.
