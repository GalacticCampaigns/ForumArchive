# Ship Combat - Discussion #2

### **Rowen** (2007-10-13 13:58:40)

What do you think of ship-to-ship combat? Have you tried it out? Is it to powerful? or do you think its engaging enough?
Perhaps some of the rules arn't clear. What ever the reason you do (or don't) like it, list them here.
I would like to hear everyones thoughts on this aspect of the Saga edition rules.

I confess to not having used this part of the rules properly yet, except in one very short scene. From what I understand, it's relatively simple and easily an improvement over RCR rules. There are some holes, however - a lack of ability to engage in a trench run on larger ships/stations, for example. If you need this rule for your game, check out my solution on R2D20 (search for "Trench Run").
Since capital ships are now "terrain" in the Starships of the Galaxy book, they may present an official solution. I'm curious to see how mine compares.

I have played it, and while I find the rules excellent for starfighter/transport combat, I'm looking for a bit more complexity with capital ships. The new Ships of the Galaxy book is said to resolve these issues, so we'll see. Starship battle and creation/modifying is one of my most favorite aspects of Star Wars gaming.

Wow only two replies. There has to be others that have tried this part of the game out and can add some input. So come on! Don't be shy, tell us what you think.

Quick and Dangerous! Almost too dangerous.
The last space to space combat I ran was kinda boring. All the players are on the same transport ship. If your not a pilot or proficient in Mechanics or Heavy Weapons you are twiddling your thumbs. They can take the role of system's operator, co-pilot (boring), Gunner if you have them and taking huge penalties usually, Engineer (boring), or your aiding or a passenger. Basically, your stuck on this ship you have a role you either do it or not. If I run another space to space battle I'm going to have the players in more ships to get them more into the battle.
I wanted to see how the space combat would pan out and it seemed very anti-climatic. The whole chase scene turned out to be me playing all the roles of crew and my players non-proficient in any starship skills sat and watched as the petty non-heroic crew members fired the laser cannons.
On the ground, with a blaster or lightsaber in hand your almost equal with your enemies. In the sky or space, you pray your shields and DR hold up for a few rounds to survive a trip to hyperspace.

Well yeah, but it's better than RCR. At least there ARE other roles you can fill.

To be honest, I don't think you've judged it very fairly. The problem is specific to your group, not to the system. If the players don't have skills for starship combat, then of course starship combat won't be any fun for them because they can't get involved. If they didn't take the skills, chances are they didn't *want* to be involved. If I were GMing for your group I'd just narrate any space combat scenes as a colourful way of getting them from planet A to planet B, rather than force them to sit through an actual encounter.

The way I have taken the rules, and this is just my take mind you. Its more for if you wanted to do a rogue squadron sorta thing. Everyone would be a pilot and have proficiencies in said skill.
Now if you were to play them this way I believe the rules would flourish. I believe the book for ships will expand on this idea a little more to accommodate each style weather you on a mostly ground or mostly space setting.

Yeah I agree.
Its true simplyscribed I am judging it hash, and I should think of it more as a tool for more grand space combat for a campaign geared toward ship combat. Right now, ships are used for transports not fighting. It just they way the PC's have chosen there skills.
You have to agree though, on the ground everyone is the pilot. Everyone gets to choose an action to attack, run use a skill or action. On a ship, you are limited, and I guess what I am saying is it is a different style of play. If all my players were pilots in there own ships, it would be different.
