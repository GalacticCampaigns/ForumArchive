# The Force, Sense Surroundings - Discussion #1

### **Rowen** (2007-09-30 18:53:37)

Lets start a little discussion. Use the force - the Sense Surroundings skill.
How would you handle this in your games. When they use this ability and hostiles are in the area would they know how many there are? If they are even hostile? The direction from the group our how far?
Its a gray area at times. So lets here your thoughts.

This wouldn't happen to be because Jace just used it? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
But yes, the point of Sense Surroundings is to allow the detection of people - though it's impossible to tell who is friendly and who is hostile - so you should be able to determine numbers. It ignores cover and concealment, which heavily implies you should know where the detected creatures are in relation to yourself. The only limit other than an inability to determine anything about a target is the ability's range - Since the effect is to ignore "cover and concealment when making Perception checks to detect or observe targets" the implication is that it is otherwise treated as normal perception (ie. sight and hearing, maybe smell), so it should only work out to the usual perceived range.

How about someone with a strong emotional bond. A spouse, brother or sister. Do you think the connection would be strong enough to allow more to be told threw the use of this ability?
((Yes, I was a bit stumped about what this ability would allow what to glean information wise. So, guilty as charged : ))

I would say that those familar to the individual could be picked out, maybe not intent except when obvious. On a nat roll of 20 as a GM I would try to add more into it, though it has not come up yet.

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-30 19:14:24)

Since you can determine whether a relative, companion, or close friend is in mortal danger or great pain if they're within 10,000 light years using Sense Force, I don't think it would be unreasonable for you to recognise people you've met before (and remember!) using Sense Surroundings. Everyone probably has a slightly unique "signature" in their shape within the Force.

### **master_Tru** (2007-09-30 19:19:14)

I remember reading books like "the last command" where Luke could tell if a clone was a "different" clone.

> Everyone probably has a slightly unique &quot;signature&quot; in their shape within the Force.

This is something I pondered on. How would one look when searching the force. Thats a pretty good description there. Also there was a book I once read by Melanie Rawn, it was the "Dragon Prince" trilogy. They had people they called sunrunners that could communicate using the rays of the sun. Everything gave off a distinct signature of colors and reverberations.
Your description reminds me heavily of that. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Yeah, Scribe is right on. Sense surroundings is highly accurate in terms of distance and direction. How else could Luke practice with the blast shield down? And the cannon provides countless instances of force-users with close bonds (twins) being able to sense each other regardless of range. I'd think they'd know it was them even if they were disguised.
The force has always been described more of a feeling than actual sight in my opinion. It has always struck me more as if they are feeling the vibrations or energy than seeing auras, or weaves like in Wheel of Time. I'm sure different force traditions have different perspectives, but for the Jedi it's always associated with feeling more than sight. Like a familiar odor or sound, but a familiar vibration instead.

<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Mind you, I don&#39;t have my book close by, so I&#39;m just going to go of memory.</span>
> When they use this ability and hostiles are in the area would they know how many there are? If they are even hostile? The direction from the group our how far?

<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Distance and direction is okay, but I won&#39;t be exact in it. &quot;between ten and twenty people over in that direction, at the edge of your senses&quot; or &quot;two people on the other side of the door&quot;. And I have a serious have problem with Jedi using their powers on people and things they can&#39;t see(with out sense surroundings).
For siblings, parents, lovers, and such were a strong emotional bond exists, I would say more information exists. Like ***MandalorianSage*** said (quite aptly, I must say. Very good description of the Force), it&#39;s more of hunches and gut instincts. After a while, Force users should be able to tell each other&#39;s emotional states through the Force&#8230;though how this differs from anyone else who stayed around each other for long periods of time, I don&#39;t know.
I would require time together before such a bond would exist. You might be able to sense if two people are related (or if that whiny little brat is your kid) but nothing more. Unless of course, you have the appropriate talents and feats.
About the only thing I disagree on is ***MandalorianSage***&#39;s use of Luke and the training drone to describe Sense Surroundings. For the most part, one cannot use the Force to sense machinery (exceptions exist, but I&#39;m sticking with the general abilities). I see the Jedi&#39;s ability to deflect blaster bolts as letting your Force driven instinct guide the blaster in the way, *before* the shot is fired. A touch of farseeing, and a bit of enhanced movements. In this case, the Force User is sensing his or her own future, an not the droids.
But, I&#39;m a bit ticked off at the power level of Force Users anyhow, and that flavors everything.</span>

Ah, but if droids have force points why can't you sense them in the force? And if they don't couldn't you sense the space void of the force as with the Yuuzhan Vong?
Not that I don't agree with your Luke/droid explanation. Just stirring the pot so to speak.

<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Just because your blind grandfather can&#39;t see you doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t help you out when ever he can, especial if your the comedic relief of his show.

<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">First: I hate the Vong. Good idea done horribly.
Second: the Force flows through droids,like it does all things&#8230;except for the Vong. They wee absent in the force,empty of it. Nothing flowed through them. So&#8230;emptiness.</span>

I think they would get exactly the information they would gain via normal Perception checks. What could be arged though, is the use of a Perception checkÂ´rather than a Use the Force check (Whitout Force Perception that is), because this allows opponents to avoid your notice via a Stealth check. And even though the rules says nothing specific about it, I think that you could make out "familiar presceneses"among a group of others.

I'm going to treat this as sight through the force. Basically, you can see through the force. A good example of how I see this working is when Neo in Matrix Revolutions "sees" the machine city. You could see in all directions at once. I would say you could sense everything as if you could see it with complete detail in your Line of Sight.
"Seeing" this way as I describe would still allow you to sense beings behinds walls/cover. I would say you know how many, and can know if they are hostile, or uneasy because you are sensing emotions as well as perceiving images through the force. You might have a connection with one of the persons or objects sensed and in that special case I would allow the person to recognize the feeling immediately. Its always a GM call on how much information you want to reveal.
***I am correcting this statemetn** As far as sensing "seeing" Stealth opponents, I would use the Sense Surroundings check as the Perception Check.*
**This is what I meant-**
Sense Surroundings allows you to ignore cover and total cover if your roll is high enough, consequently if you roll high enough on your Use the Force to remove the cover being used by the Stealing character then he no longer is hidden. You need cover to use Steath.

This I think is what is meant to be the Force Perception talent. Sense Surroundings is simply meant to be a weaker version of that talent IMO.

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-15 03:17:21)

I'm not sure if that was the intention of Force Perception, but I see what your saying. This is my take on Force Perception.
The way I read Force Perception is that you can basically substitute Force Perception for a Perception checks to avoid surprise attacks, notice enemies, sense deception, or sense influence. It's like a limited perception skill, but if you are Skill Focused in Use The Force that makes you really good at those things. Furthermore, you do all those actions as reactions, not as a swift action as Sense Surrounding cost.
During the whole discussion I have been trying to rationalize the use of sense surroundings and also considering the Miraluka. For those that do not remember what the Miraluka are; they are a humanoid race in the old d20 system that are born without any eyes, being touched by the force allowing them to see their surroundings through force. For them it is different because it is always on and considered a free action. They are constantly sensing there surroundings being able to ignore cover and concealment as if they had Improved Sense Surroundings. It is possible that they may not be granted the ability to see targets in total cover, but only time will tell when a web enhancement or new saga alien anthology comes out. They may even have a different more limited power, who knows.
Considering this I was trying to see if they would have the same ability. If it turns out they all have Improved Sense Surroundings then it would be easy to say that the Sense Surrounding ability is basically seeing like normal sight, with the exceptions that you ignore cover and concealment, and you would see 360 degrees, and if you raise the DC by 5 you could see targets in total cover. Which means if you can see your target you can sense anything you could sense with Perception.
Distance is an issue, I think I would use the range penalties described in the Perception skill under Notice Targets. Bastically, a -5 penalty for every 10 squares between you and your target. This doesn't allow the ability to see your target(s) a mile away and track them across the planet I would give the same bonuses and penalties for the size of the target(s) as perception does to noticing targets. You should be able to "see" far an be aware of your surroundings, but not be able to pinpoint your targets from great distances.
*For example,*
A Jedi walks into a forest and senses his surroundings. Four enemies are hiding behind trees and ruins with his best friend as a hostage 12 squares away. Three of the enemies are in cover and the one with the hostage is in total concealment. The Jedi and his scout and two other companions followed the tracks that end here. The Jedi decides to use the Sense Surroundings.
If the enemies decide to attack then the Sense Surroundings will not be able to stop a surprise attack. The Jedi would have to use initiative, unless he had Force Perception. Then he could react to the surprise attack.
The enemies don't surprise attack, hoping the Jedi will keep going.
The Jedi senses his surroundings, His total Use the Force check is 21.
What would he sense using my rules or perception explained under Noticing Targets on page 70?
He would see all his companions who are not in any cover and the three enemies in cover, but not the enemy and hostage in total cover. He would know exactly where the three enemies were and that they have hostile intentions.
The enemies are more than 10 squares away causing a -5 penalty to see them, which increases the Jedi's DC by 5. A DC 15 normally to see targets in cover, plus the +5 DC penalty means he needs a 20 to see his targets in cover, and a 25 to see them in total cover.
**Here is an example of where we see Sense Surroundings in the Movies-**
When Obi-Wan and Anakin were chasing Zam in EpII and they were in the bar. At first, Obi-Wan calms his apprentice and he goes off sensing his surroundings. At the time, I think Zam was thinking do I run? or attack? Obi-Wan was most likely sensing his surroundings, and when Zam decided to try and sneak attack Anakin Obi-Wan knew it was her. So, even in a crowded bar this could be used. This is a great example because Zam was a shape shifter, so as Obi-Wan was trying to Sense Zam and find her he really didn't know what she looked like, so he depended on the hostile intentions to target her.
This is how I see the power working... I would really like to hear from anyone else. It is a great topic.

Thats my thinking of what Force Perception does as well. It allows you to substitute your regular senses for the Force. What Sense Surroundings does, IMO, is to make it easier to find someone using cover. This is still possible using only normal perception (or only the Force Perception talent), but you take a -5/-10 when the target has cover/total cover. With Sense Surroundings you ignore these penalties.

Personally, my first thought is that Miraluka should get the Force Perception talent for free instead, but thatÂ´s probably a balance issue. My reasoning fot this is that itÂ´s always been said that Miraluka sight works as normal sight, but is based of the Force.

I agree. all the penalties and bonuses for distance, size, etc applies just as for a normal Perception check. Why? because Sense Surroundings doesnÂ´t **substitute** a Perception check, but rather **enhances** it. The jedi in your example could with a good Perception roll notice all his targets. If he used Sense Surroundings (wich he should), he can ignore the cover bonus for the ones with cover with a DC 15 UtF check, and with a DC 20 UtF check, he also ignores that of the one with total cover. So (using Sense Surroundings, DC 20), the Percepion DCs to notice his targets are probably their Stealth checks.

That is a good example, but another one that I always associate witht his ability is the Trash Compactor in Ep IV. Luke can easily see Han, Leia and Chewie, but the monster is hidden underwater and in a lot of garbage, ie total cover according to me. Luke uses Sense Surroundings, and then the Perception DC to notice the monster isnÂ´t that high. But since itÂ´s not a familiar prescense to him, all he notices is "There somthing alive in here"
ThatÂ´s my feelings on the matter
