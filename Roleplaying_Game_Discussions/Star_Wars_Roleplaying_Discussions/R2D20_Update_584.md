# R2D20 Update

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-02 20:50:16)

I've updated [R2D20](http://saga.wetpaint.com/ "http://saga.wetpaint.com/") with my adventure, the Will of the World (Part I). The Part II is also up, but since I haven't written the adventure yet (see the Design Diary over in the Gm/Storyteller forum) it's blank.
Both have been additionally been added to the Indexes.
