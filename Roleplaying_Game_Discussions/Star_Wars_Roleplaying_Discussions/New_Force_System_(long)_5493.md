# New Force System (long)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-09 11:39:04)

First, IÂ´d like to say that this is not in any way an idea that IÂ´ve decided to implement,
itÂ´s just something that IÂ´ve been working on as an alternative to the current Force system.
It is a step back towards RCR, with more than one skill governing Force abilities.
It is also a complete revision of the system, but it serves, IMO, to fix some of the flaws I see
in the current system. Those issues are:
1: Too much "spell system", the Force isnÂ´t D&D magic.
2: The lure of the Dark Side, or the lack of it.
3: In some ways, specialization is quite limited.
Be warned, those of you who donÂ´t likes complexity. This system is more complex than the current.
My proposition is this: Remove Use the Force and the concept of Powers from the game.
Replace it with a number of Force Skills, and make the various uses of the Force applications of
those skills. To limit access to some abilities, make these abilities trained only uses of the skill,
and for even higher limitation, make them focused only. To limit how often you can use th Force,
Force-Sensitives are given a new stat: Force Power. This is a number that represents how much they can use the Force.
Every round in combat that they makes a check with a Force skill, their Force Power lowers by 1.
By spending one round without making a Force skill check, their Force Power rises by 1.
When their Force Power reaches 0, after every round in wich they made a Force skill check, they drop -1
on the CT. Also, several abilities will cost additional Force Power to be acivated.
The Force Training feat will be revised to work as follows:
Every time you select it, you will gain 1+Wis modifier Force Power.
Also, the Force Sensitivity and Strong in the Force feats gives you 1 Force Power.
Here are the Force skills I could see, and the abilities associated with them:
Battlemind(Using the Force to enhance your combat prowess)
Control(Using the Force to control your body and the Force in you)
Telepathy(Using the Force to connect, affect and speak to minds)
Telekinesis(Using the Force to move objects with telekinetic power in any way)
Dark Side(The Powers of the Dark Side)
Sense(Using the Force to sense you surroundings and enhance you senses)
Alter(Using the Force to effect and alter the environment and things around you)
And hereÂ´s a few examples of how one application of a skill could be, and how some talents could be altered:
**Battle Strike(Battlemind Skill)**
Make a Battlemind skill check as a Swift action. The result determines the benefit.
DC 10: +1d6 on next successfull attack
DC 15 (trained only): As DC 10, but +2d6 damage, and +1 to next attack roll
DC 20 (trained only): As DC 15, but +3d6 damage
DC 25 (trained only): As DC 20, but +4d6 damage
DC 30 (focused): As DC 25, but +2 to the attack roll
DC 35 (focused, costs 1 Force Power): As DC 30, but increase critical multiplier by 1
**Deflect(Battlemind skill)**
As a reaction to a ranged attack, you can make a Battlemid skill check. If you check result exceeds the attack roll of
the attack, the attack takes no effect on you. Everytime you uses this ability in the same round, your next attempt suffers
a -5 penalty to the check. This penalty stacks with the penalty from using the Block ability in the same round.
You can also use this ability to deflect some of the barrage from autofire. If you succeed in your check, you take half damage if
the autofire attack hits, and none if it misses.
Special: In order to use this ability, you need one of a few certain talents (see example below).
**Deflect(talent)**
You can use the Deflect application of the Battlemind skill as long as you have a lit lightsaber in your hand.
**Sense Surroundings(Sense Skill)**
As a swift action, make a Sense check. The result determines the benefit:
DC 10: Ignore penatly from cover and concealment to your next Perception check
DC 20 (trained only): As DC 15, but ignore total cover as well
DC 25 (focused, costs one Force Power): As DC 20, but ignore total concealment as well
**Force Speed(Control Skill)**
Make a Control skill check as a free action. The result determines the benefit:
DC 10 (trained only): You gain +2 squares to your speed
DC 20 (trained only): As DC 10, but you gain +4 squares
DC 30 (trained only): As DC 20, but you gain +6 squares
**Force Jump(Control Skill)**
Make a Control skill check as a free action. The result determines the benefit:
DC 10: You gain a +5 bonus to your next Jump check
DC 15 (trained only): As DC 10, but you gain a +10 bonus and may consider yourself to have a running start
DC 20 (trained only): As DC 15, but you gain a +20 bonus
DC 25 (focused): As DC 20, but you gain a +30 bonus
DC 30 (focused): As DC 25, but you gain +40 bonus
**Force Disarm(Telekinesis skill)**
Make a Telekinesis skill check as a standard action. Use that skill check result instead of an attack roll in a Disarm attack against one opponent within 6 squares. If you are trained in Telekinesis, you may ignore the +10 bonus to Reflex Defense of the opponent.
**Force Protection(Control Skill)**
Make a Control skill check as a full-round action. You gain DR according to the chart below. Every subsequent round, you may spend a swift action to maintain this DR. It costs 1 Force Power each round, you maintains it, and you may not recover Force Power by not making any Force skill checks during those rounds.
DC 15: You gain DR 5
DC 20 (trained only): As DC 15, but you gain DR 10
DC 30 (focused, costs 1 Force Power): As DC 20, but you gain DR 15
So, what do you guys think?

Seems unnecessarily complicated. I would suggest that instead of using this "Force Power" idea, that you simply keep the original OCR/RCR Skill System, but modify it a little for Saga:
IE: Give the Jedi class a few more skill choices, and roll some of the Force Skills into each other, then say the skills work as they do in Saga. Then, you go back to the old Attribute system, with each skill being governed by the appropriate attribute from RCR (most Alter skills were based on Int, for example.)
Some of the uses of the specific skills can be used "untrained" by someone who has Force Sensitivity but lacks the skill, and some cannot. If you want to limit the power a little further, just stipulate that no more than say.... half of your starting skills can be spent on Force Skills.
This way, it's possible to build a "powerful force user" but it's a little skill and feat intensive to do so.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-01-09 17:41:52)

This is...interesting. Pretty niffty concept.
Here are a few thoughts and observations, disregard at you leisure:[ul]
[*]**Force Skills:** Jedi only get 2 skill points per level, meaning these new Force Skills are going to be an expensive investment of feats. This gets worst when you start getting Skill Focus in individual Force skills. I actually **like** this, mind you. But it is worth thinking about. Giving the Jedi class more skills may not be the right answer, but such as it is, you will see a lot of Force Users starting as Scouts, Scoundrels, and Nobles, taking Force Sensitivity as their 1st level feat.  
[*]**Force Power:** Most combat is suppose to last one a few rounds, right? About four to six I think. With a +3 wisdom modifier, Force Sensitivity, and Force Training, you will have a Force Power of 5, which is a good amount, *especially* with the way it recharges. Pretty niffty. This means you can go all out for a while (and for a powerful Force Mage, a long while) but eventually, you will burn out, and you need to catch your breath).  
[*]**Dark Side:** What about a feat named "Power of the Darkside" or something, granting you a skill focus in the Dark Side skill, and also grants +2 (or more) Force Power. That would be some temptation, and you might even want to make some mechanic where if the hero uses those two Force Power, they get a darkside point for doing so, because the hero taps into the darkside to use them.  
[*]**Force Skills, Part Two:** You have replaced the need to multiple Force Training feats (to get more Force Powers) with the need for Force Skills (for more abilities). This, I like, and again, say it's niffty. Instead of spending one feat and one Trained skill to be a complete master at the Force, you have to spend a lot both. But you can easily get away with only one or two Force Training feats (the one increasing Force Power), so there is a trade off, even this method you have is much more feat intensive.  
[*]**Force Skills, Part Two:** You expect what force powers a character has to be used much more often. If you use two Force Skills in the same round, do you lose more Force Power? Like, if our Jedi activates Force Speed to sprint across the docking bay, does a Force Jump to get on the platform the bad guy is on, and then makes an attack using Battle Strike, does his Force Power drop by three? If so, then Force Training is even more important, and more of a burn on feats.  
[*]**Strong in the Force:** I think Strong in the Force should do more than just increase Force Power by one. Maybe give a flat +2 to all Force Skills, or increase the recharge rate while at rest (to, say, two per round), or something. Increasing Force Power is cool and all, but just minor increase is overshadowed by Force Training. Something cool, but not a duplicate of another feat.[/ul]  
Like I said, niffty. I like. I may just steal it. Good job on it.

@Bob:
ItÂ´s more complicated than Saga, but what isnÂ´t? I think that RCR had too many Force skills, but Saga might have too few. So IÂ´ve generalized it into a few general areas of Force "expertise". I though "untrained", "trained" and "focused" was nice and simple ways to decide your level of power. IÂ´ve been thinking about attributes for the skills, but I think IÂ´ll stick with Cha for them all, not to upset original Saga balance. And while it is more skill and feat intensive, you now have access to more abilities.
@Breeder:
**Force Skills**: IÂ´ve been thinking about that too. It strikes towards Jedi most with theit limited skills. Instead of have UtF as a "must" skill at 1st, noe they only get 1 Force skill. Since Jedi are supposed to be the base class you know has ben trained in the Force, I was thinking of adding a Skill Training(any Force skill) to their starting feats. But maybe that would make Jedi too much the dominant Force-users?
**Force Power**: I know you can get a lot of Force Power easily. But I thought it would be somewhat balanced since you had to spend more feats to train/focus in the skills. Also many abilities would cost extra Force Power to activate (see some of my examples, I changed them)
**Dark Side**: IÂ´ve mostly worked with the mechanics for this new system, not so much started with modifying talents, etc, but this could be a nice thing. Perhaps a mod for the "Power of the Darkside" talent.
**Force Skills, part 1 and 2**: see Force Power answer.
**Strong in the Force**: It would still have its original effects (roll d8). Otherwise, see Dark Side answer.
IÂ´ll try to get up an example of a few characters and more skill/talent erxamples if youÂ´d like.

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-11 09:11:43)

Its kinda funny that your discussing a skill based system, because before Saga came out I came real close to using the Mutants & Masterminds power system for Jedi. Where your powers never run out, but you have limitations on how much you can do with them. It was more cinematic, and with the system not using Hit Points it was very appealing.
But back to your idea, and I know you have been playing with this for awhile now, I've seen on WotC forums and you already brought up once on our forums before.
Breaking down "Use the Force". I like the idea, but then as I try to balance it out I start to hate it. It may be a good idea to still have "Use the Force" as a prerequisite skill because it comes with Force Sensitive. Let "Use the Force" be able to use all the untrained features of skills for each new Force Power Skill you have created, or use the current list of abilities that you can do with "Use the Force" already in Saga. It would sort of a Jedi's all around training or awaking in some cases. That would mean re-writing all the force powers with untrained, trained and focused which you have started in your example. This gives that old "Universal" force power feel.
I like your Force Power idea. I see that basically you want to be able to use your force power indefinitely in a long battle. A recharging effect, it seems cool, but I doubt most battles last that long anyway. Plus, you always have the 20 factor (roll a natural 20 on any force power get all your powers back), and you have force points to grab a power from your force power suite for an extra use. I am guessing you could use a force point to give you a +1 Force Power rating. I would let a player spend a Destiny Point to get all the force powers in a suite back, if it was climatic moment. So, this recharging effect sounds cool, but is it really necessary.
Your opening up a whole can of worms, which I'm sure you knew when you started this project, but hey that's what all this creative thinking is about, and I'm having fun responding.
First difficulty I see is you are eliminating talent tree's which are essential to the game, your turning some talents into powers into skills. For example, your Force Protection example is like Damage Reduction 10 for the Control Talent Tree. Also, talents into skills, another example, Deflect was in a talent that used a skill now it becomes a skill; now I use a feat to buy the Force Power skill, but what do I do with the talents that are accumulating, that I would have used to buy Deflect. There has to be a balance between Talents, Feats, and Skills. You are re-arranging the allocation and it would take some major tweaking and play testing to find a new balance. Now I can buy force powers with a Class-Bonus feats Skill Training or Character Level Bonus (Universal) Feat and am left with Talents tree that have been chopped to stubbles.
So now you have talents that you get to spend else where on a shorter list, while you are using all your character bonus feats and class bonus feats on Skill Training to pay for the Talents that are now skills.
When I read your idea I felt like you were trying to find something in-between RCR and Saga, but the problem is that Saga has destroyed skills and its really all about feats and talents now. I see where you were going, but it would take a termendous amount of balancing and playtesting to put the Jedi where you wanted them.
Maybe Version 4.0 Star Wars will be a new system that is somewhere in between, and we might see some of your ideas come to fruitation.
I don't know, maybe instead of letting the Jedi Class just choose from the Control, Alter, Sense, and Darkside Talent trees they instead need to buy the Talent Tree with a Feat. I think the new power suite system will prove itself over time. We need to see more Tradition Restrictions, more traditions, new uses for force powers, new force powers, new force talents, new force techniques, new force secrets. The more powers, techniques, and talents the harder it is to choose a path and we start to see diversification and specialization.
I think I like your original idea better, break down every power that uses the skill "Use the Force" into a new force power skill, control, alter, sense, dark side, light side. and add those 4 new skills to the game. hehe, simple. I know its a little one sided because of alter, but it sill serves the purpose of spending more feats on skill training.
On the subject of the lure of the dark side. I think by not having to buy a force power skill the lure of the dark side it makes the lure easier. Your idea goes the other way making it more difficult by having to spend additional feats to acquire. You want to always have that ability to fall, and give in, but its not as easy with your proposed idea.
Just my thoughts.
On a side note, I like your Force Protection version, because Damage Reduction 10 Talent feat right now is so over powered.

I agree that most battles arenÂ´t meant to last very long. But I thought to balance that by the number of feats you have to spend on buying skill training for Force skills, and also the fact that many abilities would cost additional power to use. But maybe it should be changed to recover at a rate of 1/minute or something like that, allowing FPs and DPs to recover more faster, as well as reworking talents to recover it.
> Your opening up a whole can of worms, which I&#39;m sure you knew when you started this project, but hey that&#39;s what all this creative thinking is about, and I&#39;m having fun responding.

I know that, and I like it <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> IÂ´m also having fun making this thing up.

IÂ´m not removing them, IÂ´m reworking most of them. Those that get turned into skills (like DR 10) IÂ´ll try to replace with other talents (IÂ´m thinking Force Endurance for example). Deflect still requires a talent to use, but now I can possibly add more talents to make it work not only with Lightsabers in the future. Of course itÂ´ll be a lot of work restoring balance to the Force, but hey, thatÂ´s what my spare time is for :
> So now you have talents that you get to spend else where on a shorter list, while you are using all your character bonus feats and class bonus feats on Skill Training to pay for the Talents that are now skills.

like I said, IÂ´m not planning to leave the talent trees crippled, but will try to fill them out.

Yes it would, but this is more of a fun idea than anything serious. If someone want to use it, please do. Maybe IÂ´ll try it in a game or so myself.

I donÂ´t have a huge problem with the current system, this is more a way to try and make it "my perfect way"

IÂ´m sorry, but I think yuou confuse me with someone else. This is my first posting of a new Force system. IÂ´ve commented on others though. And I made those 6 skills because those where the areas I could divide the Force into.

I think it is. My planning is to have many uses of the "Dark Side" skill be mostly untrained with low DCs. Then you can access them at all time, gaining power in a quick and easy way.
Thanks for your input. IÂ´ll try to get a few example characters up, and more converted talents and new skill uses to perhaps clarify things more.

The only real determining factor should be whether you're trained or not. Some uses of a particular skill can be used untrained, while others require training. Skill Focus should just represent a particularly skilled character, but all uses of a skill should be open to everyone. Now, the difficulty of some of those skill uses might be increased a little (thus making it harder for somebody who doesn't have SKill Focus) but you shouldn't restrict any uses beyond "Trained/Untrained."
I think you should remoe the "Force Power" concept entirely, and just make the whole thing work with the Condition Track....
You can use the force a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier before needing to check against your Endurance skill, or somesuch. Say your Wisdom is 16 (+3 Modifier). for every 3 times you use the force, you need to make a check using your Endurance skill, or you drop one step on the Condition Track.

Maybe "focused" isnÂ´t needed as a power level. You could just have those abilities be "trained only". I just have something for 3-step power levels <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> But I meant only for really "super"-abilities to be "focused", just to make sure that someone who is merely trained donÂ´t get there through some exploit of the rules, like using a NobleÂ´s help or Skilled Advisor Jedi. Those abilities should come from you, not someone else. That was my thought at least.
IÂ´d say your suggestion with having Endurance checks sounds more complicated than my Force Power idea, to me at least. What would be the DC for your proposed Endurance check? And doing so would remove a lot of the balancing feat requirements for Force-users.

And I think it's unfair to treat Force Skills as any different from other skills, simply because they are Force Skills. Unless you want to go and create a whole new list of "Focused" only applications of other skills as well, it's going to create arguments.

Those abilities are abilities, not "rules exploits." They were specifically designed to make it easier for people to do thier jobs. That is the Noble's entire function in a party. Limited combat abilities, and the only useful skills he has are the interaction skills and Treat Injury. If you don't want to allow party buffs, remove the Noble class, and disallow Skilled Advisor.

My idea is designed to make use of existing systems, and thus requires less bookeeping, and is thus less complicated.

DC 15, modified for your current postion on the Condition Track, of course.
> And doing so would remove a lot of the balancing feat requirements for Force-users.

Which is in turn re-balanced by the fact that you are needing to spend numerous class skills on aquiring the various Force Skills, or spend feats on Force Training.

One could argue that it already is, since it is the skill in the game with the far most uses, far more than any other, except maybe Pilot now when SotG is out. I personally have no problem with keeping the Force skills a little more special, because to me they should be.

Ok, calling that exploiting the rules was wrong. What I meant was that the abilities I limit like that are the pinnacle of acheivement in a specific ability, and such skill shall only be able to be gained from personal skill, not from someone else. They are meant to be the secrets of the Force that you have to discover yourself, not something Yoda can whisper in your ear.
> My idea is designed to make use of existing systems, and thus requires less bookeeping, and is thus less complicated.

It makes use of existing systems, yes. But less bookkeeping? maybe, but very minimal.
With my suggestion, youÂ´d have to keep track of a simple number, just like you do Hp and CT. YouÂ´d lower it by 1 when making a Force skill check in a round, and maybe more, if you uses an ability that says to do so.
With your suggestion, youÂ´d have to keep track of how often youÂ´d used any Force ability, even in previous rounds. And youÂ´d also get several more dice rolls added to your play.
> DC 15, modified for your current postion on the Condition Track, of course.

I canÂ´t see the "of course", since most Endurance checks starts at DC 10. And did you mean that the DC goes up by the same amount as you receive in penalty for falling on the CT? If so, then that might be a little harsh. If someone scores a -2 CT attack on you (could be a simple stun attack), youÂ´d face a DC 17 check with a -2 to your check. If it is a -3 CT hit (stun attack with Dastardly Strike, for example), it would be a DC 20 check with a -5 on your check.
> Which is in turn re-balanced by the fact that you are needing to spend numerous class skills on aquiring the various Force Skills, or spend feats on Force Training.

If I remove the concept of Force Power, then Force Training wouldnÂ´t do anything in my system, unless I make up another use for it. And one of the points of this system is that you donÂ´t necessarily have to be trained in all the Force skills to be a good Force-user. Many skills will have applications that can be used untrained at a relatively low DC. The examples I threw up are just something I wrote together to have an example to show, theyÂ´re probably not balanced for this system, and I try to modify them to better be so.

But what you are proposing to do is break Force Use down into individual skills, meaning that you must make an individual skill choice if you want to be able to use most of the abilities of that skill at all. Wanna move an object with your mind? Either you do it untrained or you must select the Telekenesis (or Move Object) skill. The current force systems handles this rather elegently to begin with the UtF/Force Power system, but your system just makes people not want to play Force Users. I know it does so for me.

Ok, calling that exploiting the rules was wrong. What I meant was that the abilities I limit like that are the pinnacle of acheivement in a specific ability, and such skill shall only be able to be gained from personal skill, not from someone else. They are meant to be the secrets of the Force that you have to discover yourself, not something Yoda can whisper in your ear.
Unless those special powers are so earth-shatteringly spectacular as to justify it (like being able to pull an ISD out of orbit) all it's going to do is cause contention. And if they ARE that earth-shatteringly spectacular, they'll break the game. So either way, it's a potentially lose-lose proposition, and unnescesary. Just set the DC's higher to make it more likely that only somebody who DOES HAVE Skill Focus will succeed.

It makes use of existing systems, yes. But less bookkeeping? maybe, but very minimal.
With my suggestion, youÂ´d have to keep track of a simple number, just like you do Hp and CT. YouÂ´d lower it by 1 when making a Force skill check in a round, and maybe more, if you uses an ability that says to do so.
With your suggestion, youÂ´d have to keep track of how often youÂ´d used any Force ability, even in previous rounds. And youÂ´d also get several more dice rolls added to your play.
All my system requires is three things:
1. Know your Wis modifier.
2. Keep a piece of scratch paper and a pencil handy.
3. Make a little tick on the piece of paper every time you use the force, and every time you make the Endurance check, put a stroke through it. When the encounter is over, you cross off all the ticks.
Much, much, much less bookeeping.

I canÂ´t see the "of course", since most Endurance checks starts at DC 10. And did you mean that the DC goes up by the same amount as you receive in penalty for falling on the CT? If so, then that might be a little harsh. If someone scores a -2 CT attack on you (could be a simple stun attack), youÂ´d face a DC 17 check with a -2 to your check. If it is a -3 CT hit (stun attack with Dastardly Strike, for example), it would be a DC 20 check with a -5 on your check.
That should have said "with the skill check modified for your current position on the condition track of course." Basically, you take penalties to your defenses, attack rolls and skill checks based on your position on the condition track.

If I remove the concept of Force Power, then Force Training wouldnÂ´t do anything in my system, unless I make up another use for it. And one of the points of this system is that you donÂ´t necessarily have to be trained in all the Force skills to be a good Force-user. Many skills will have applications that can be used untrained at a relatively low DC. The examples I threw up are just something I wrote together to have an example to show, theyÂ´re probably not balanced for this system, and I try to modify them to better be so.
Force Training should be the feat used to aquire Force Skills. Alternatively, it could be used to grant addition force uses without the Endurance check. As far as many Force Skills having untrained uses, I would say that only the most rudimentary of things should be achievable untrained because we ARE talking about Force Skills here. As far as the DC's go, the lower the DC, the more crap-tacular the effect should be, as it is with the current Force System. Very few useful things can be achieved untrained in the current system.

Sorry DarthAnthrax,
I thought it was you who mentioned the breaking down of Force Powers into Alter,Control, Sense, Dark Side Force Power skills.
Now I have a clear picture of your project. I would love to give you constructive help, but it would be too much work LOL. I mean you are re-working the whole system and adding new talents, its just too much work. hehe.
But I like your enthusiasm, and I can certainly appreciate where this is leading. More ways to use Deflect, Damage Reduction with tiers, and much more that will open up with the new talents.

> But what you are proposing to do is break Force Use down into individual skills, meaning that you must make an individual skill choice if you want to be able to use most of the abilities of that skill at all. Wanna move an object with your mind? Either you do it untrained or you must select the Telekenesis (or Move Object) skill. The current force systems handles this rather elegently to begin with the UtF/Force Power system, but your system just makes people not want to play Force Users. I know it does so for me.

If telekinesis is what you want to do, then you train in it. If not, then you just leave it untrained. You can still do several things with it, taking 10 in combination with attribute/level modifier can pretty easily be a DC 15 check, wich could be lifting a large object or something like that.

Maybe the "focused" level arenÂ´t needed, but IÂ´ll try to clarify my thoughts. The difference between "trained" and "focused" DCs perhaps only has to be 5, but the "focused" can still be an ability that perhaps would be unbalancing if it was allowed to someone with just training, but still is very easy to do for a focused character.

My system requires the following:
You need to keep track of your Force Power. This can be ridiculously easy, just use a d20 (since having more than 20 Force Power is overkill IMO). Whenever an ability says to lower your Force Power, do it. At the end of the round, if you made a Force skill check during the round, lower by 1. Otherwise, increase by 1.
I canÂ´t really see the great difference in bookeeping.
> That should have said &quot;with the skill check modified for your current position on the condition track of course.&quot; Basically, you take penalties to your defenses, attack rolls and skill checks based on your position on the condition track.

The problem I see with that is that it is very easy to become immune or mearly immune to any limit on Force-using at all. There are many ways to create a character that can have a modifier of more than +15 a low levels, and that would only have any real chance of failure if he was reduced to -5 or -10 CT.

I donÂ´t think it is fair to say that it *should* be Force Training that has to determine what abilities you have in the Force. One of the points of this is to give Force-Users a larger repertoire of abilities without having to spend a lot of Force Training feats to do so. Thus they can have *the potential* to do a lot of things at low levels, and instead Force Training can govern how *much* they can use those abilities.
As for DCs, I was thinking to have untrained ones in the range of 10-20, with DC 20 being for things that you should have the *potential* to pull of, but that arenÂ´t very easy to do.

Yesss. I'm not an idiot, and I do understand that. The point is that with the current system, somebody can have a wide range of force powers (albeit with few uses of those powers) with only a small investment (one skill, a few feats, and a decent Wis Modifier.)
With a Wis Modifier of + 3, 3 Force Training feats, and the Use the Force skill, you can have up to 12 force powers to use in each encounter, which could be 12 uses of Battle Strike, or 12 different powers. Each encounter.
Your proposed skill system would require the character to have 12 different trained skills to be able to pull off the same thing, with or without a few uses that can be used untrained. And then spend a bunch of feats to be able to use the force more often. To get up to the equivalent level you'd need 12 Force Skills +3 Feats in your system. Waaaaay too skill/feat intensive to be viable for anything but a "pure" force user, in which cas you're also looking at a "one trick pony."
And Taking 10? "Distractions, threats and danger make it impossible to take 10. You also cannot take 10 when using a skill untrained. The GM may make an exception for truely routine activities." Pg. 60, right hand side, under "Taking 10," second paragraph.
"Truely Routine Activities," in other words, things which you shouldn't even bother using the force for. Like turning on the coffee machine! :

Then it's a waste of time to even bother being focused. Your system is ALREADY extremely feat and skill intensive, and to make an ADDITIONAL level of skill that is required just to access the top level powers in a particular Force Skill is going to make your Force Users even MORE of the "One Trick Pony" variety, and it's also going to probably piss your players off. I'm sure you're an excellent GM, but I wouldn't want to play in a game using your system.
The Saga system as it stands now allows for the One Trick Pony variety of Force User. But it ALSO allows for a character who has numerous abilities at thier command, with limited uses of those abilities.

The difference in bookeeping comes in when you are trying to figure out how many feats/skills your character needs to have. Character Creation in your system is going to be a nightmare, unless you also give Force Users extra feats/skills. And then, you're going to have to do the same for other characters, to make it fair. Either that, or nobody is going t come to the table with a Force Using character.
Do you know why the current Saga Force System was created? To cut down on the number of Skills and Feats needed for Force Users to use the force. Under the RCR, players were having trouble building "well rounded" force characters, because to be able to use the force reasonably well while maintaining basic competency in other skills, Force Users needed more skill points than everyone else. This lead to problems with "One Trick Pony" characters.
> The problem I see with that is that it is very easy to become immune or mearly immune to any limit on Force-using at all.

True, but you're going to have to spend skills, and feats to do it. And if somebody does so, then they deserve to be immune, don't you think?

Thus they can have *the potential* to do a lot of things at low levels, and instead Force Training can govern how *much* they can use those abilities.

But your system is NOT going to give people a larger repertoire of force abilities. It's going to give them a SMALLER one! Or else, it's going to give them a much smaller repertoire of other abilities, because they've spent most of thier feats and skills on being able to use the force!
Under the Saga force system, a 9th level Human character with a +3 Wis Modifier can have.... up to 20 Force Powers. Under YOUR system, he'll need to spend **20!** skills to do so!
> As for DCs, I was thinking to have untrained ones in the range of 10-20, with DC 20 being for things that you should have the *potential* to pull of, but that arenÂ´t very easy to do.

The Untrained uses should have DC's based purely on how useful they are, irregardless of whether they can be used untrained. This will prevent "twinks" from using all the skills untrained, simply because they get a bucket full of moderately useful tricks without the investment of any skills or feats.

Sorry, I didnÂ´t mean to make you sound like an idiot. But it seems you have some numbers wrong here. If you look carefully at my first post, then I specificially named the **6** different Force skills that I came up with. Of those, 1 is very optional (Dark Side). That leaves 5 Force skills to train in. Yes it is more than current system, but then again I donÂ´t think you have to be trained in every single skill unless you want to be a true master of the Force (think Yoda or Palpatine). Here are some examples of what skills I could see canonical Force-users be trained in:
Anakin: Battlemind, Control, Dark Side (as Vader), Telekinesis (as Vader)
Obi-Wan: Control, Sense, Battlemind, Telepathy (taken late in his career, maybe gained by the Int mod from going middle-age)
Dooku: Alter, Telekinesis, Dark Side
Maul: Battlemind, Dark Side, Control (maybe)
These may not be entirely accurate (I may be forgetting EU sources and so on), but hopefully it makes my intention clear. It is a few skills more than you need to spend under current system, but you donÂ´t have to get them all at 1st level. Also, you probably need to spend 1 (maybe 2) feats less on Force Training. With the +3 Wis mod, and 3 Force Training feats, youÂ´d have a Force power of 13. Depending on character and campaign that may be too much or just about right.

I think I adressed this above.

I know the difference between Saga and RCR. I agree that RCR had a little too many Force skills. But IÂ´ve not reverted back to RCR, just taken a step in that direction, because I think that my personal ideal Force system lies somewhere between them.
> True, but you&#39;re going to have to spend skills, and feats to do it. And if somebody does so, then they deserve to be immune, don&#39;t you think?

They would have to spend one skill, and a very small number of feats or talents. And I donÂ´t think there should be ways to become completely immune. Even Yoda and Luke have shown great signs of weariness after using the Force a lot, and they are among the best Force-users ever. Also, this would force Force-users to take a skill that may not be a normal choice for them, unless they want to suffer heavily when using the Force. What about a jedi who gets fired at 2 times/round and wants to use Deflect on both those attacks? If Deflect is her only Force-useage, sheÂ´ll be forced to make (and probably fail) 1 check every 1 1/2 round, and when she fails, she drops on the CT. If she tries to use any other ability, the checks come even tighter and sheÂ´ll be hit even harder. Not at all fair, IMO.
> But your system is NOT going to give people a larger repertoire of force abilities. It&#39;s going to give them a SMALLER one!

How can they not get more abilities? First, there are several untrained abilities that they can use. Second, as a lot of abilities goes in as applications of a skill, training in one skill grants a whole bunch of new abilities. And IÂ´ll not comment that there arenÂ´t 20 Force skills :|
> The Untrained uses should have DC&#39;s based purely on how useful they are, irregardless of whether they can be used untrained. This will prevent &quot;twinks&quot; from using all the skills untrained, simply because they get a bucket full of moderately useful tricks without the investment of any skills or feats.

That was meant to be the fact that when you get lucky with the dice, you are suddenly able to perform some instant feat of heroics with a more cinematic feel. If you know that way up there is a DC that you cannot reach except for on a roll of 18+, you probably wonÂ´t atempt it too often. But I think it can give a very strong feeling of heroism if you attempt it when there seems to be no other exit, and succeed. And by keeping those specyacular DCs high, a "twink" would have to spend so much on being able to do everything untrained that he is better off training in the skill. And not all abilities have untrained uses, see Force Speed for instance.

Because being abrasive is always a great way to change somebody's mind.
Me, I want to hear more about it. What you have is nifty, but only a tease. So, I wanna focus on seeing if this idea can work. Make it manageable, usable.
I think that instantly being great at all force using powers is a little bit too much, anyway. You only had three level of Use the Force (untrained, trained, and Focused). That bites. Way to easy- and next to no reason not to- for any force user to get all three. It was like every single Jedi out there was a prodigy child. And hardly a "one trick pony". Force users always had a tendency to be versatile in their chosen field. "Hm. Do I want to be a guy who shoots blasters really well...or a guy who shoots blaster really well, *and* can lift a space ship with my mind!" *Nien* on the taxing of the brain pan.
Maybe...six skills may be too much. Maybe not. This needs some play testing. After all, Jedi only have a tiny amount of skills, and we don't want every Jedi starting off as a Scout or Noble. No fun.
I like the Force Power deal. The recharge is fast, so out of combat, your force user is still cool. Inside of combat...well, Luke, Vadar, and Yodi were cool for a reason, right?
Back to skills. Ever thought about combining them according to a theme? Like have a feat "Jedi Guardian/Weapon Master (it grants Battlemind and Control as trained skills), "Jedi Sentinel" (Telepathy and Sense as trained skills), and "Jedi Powerhouse" (Alter and Telekinesis). *Everyone* will use Darkside powers as if trained, hence the lure of the Darkside.
You could replace "Jedi" with "Force" or something for the non-Jedi Force Users.
Part of the bonus of the Jedi class would be getting one of the above feats (Force Warrior, Sentinel, Mental-Bench-Presser) at first level. How Focus in the individual
Focus could go is up in the air (either by pair or by single skill). I'm not sure yet. I do think that anyone taking skill focus (Force Skill) could pick up Skill Focus (Dark Side skills) as well, for free. Lure of the Dark Side.
A bonus for Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters could be Force Coolness. Force Coolness lets you either take one of the three feats (Warrior, Sentinel, Alter-man) that you don't have, or apply a focus to one you do have. This would make the already cool prestige classes cool to have. And would represent the greater understanding of the force.
Also things to consider, is the addressing of the Jedi Knight and Jedi Master (and all of the other Force Using prestige classes). Who are they going to interact with this? Do Knights and master get a better recharge rate for Force Power? Does some one with Strong in the Force also get a recharge bonus (I know you talked about this, but I'm just throwing it out there)?
Anyhow, them are my thoughts. Disregard at yer leisure.

Too bad you feel that way. You had good points, but I donÂ´t feel that IÂ´m "married" to my idea, I just donÂ´t agree with the issues you have with it.

I donÂ´t know. Those six were the general areas of the Force that I could see. I donÂ´t want to simply give Jedi more skills to start with, thatÂ´s a simple solution of the Dark Side. However, I do think it helps to illustrate the fact that not everyone are experts at all aspects of the Force at once (1st level).
> I like the Force Power deal. The recharge is fast, so out of combat, your force user is still cool. Inside of combat&#8230;well, Luke, Vadar, and Yodi were cool for a reason, right?

Thanks, you should see the many ideas of how to use it that pops up in my head :
> Back to skills. Ever thought about combining them according to a theme? Like have a feat &quot;Jedi Guardian/Weapon Master (it grants Battlemind and Control as trained skills), &quot;Jedi Sentinel&quot; (Telepathy and Sense as trained skills), and &quot;Jedi Powerhouse&quot; (Alter and Telekinesis). *Everyone* will use Darkside powers as if trained, hence the lure of the Darkside.

That is an interesting suggestion. However I am a little bit worried that it could remove some of the balance gained by having to spend multiple skills/feats to train in the skills. If the prereqs are set to allow it taken at 1st level, then someone could easy become trained in (nearly) all skills at 1st level at the cost of 1 feat and 1 skill maybe. And wouldnÂ´t that also put the Jedi class back as the way better choice of Force-users? But you could easily say that those feats does something to enhance the related skills or something similar. Or perhaps have the feat allow training in one skill, but have some additional effect on uses of that skill?
To represent the lure of the Dark Side, I was thinking this:
1. Have several Dark Side skills (Dark Rage best example) be very useful untrained. If Dark Rage can grant you a +2 to attack and damage rolls with a DC 10 check, and +4 with a DC 15, IÂ´d find it very tempting indeed to make that check. You could also say that you can gain a +2 bonus for favorable circumstances to the check if you are under the effect of strong emotions.
2. Have some **very** tempting talents/feats, and also some kind of basic Dark Side option avaible to all Force-users.
When you say that everyone uses Dark Side as trained, did you mean with a +5 to the skill check, or just that they can use the "trained only" applications? The former is a little off I think (training means that you have trained in something after all), but the latter seems very appropriate to me.
> A bonus for Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters could be Force Coolness. Force Coolness lets you either take one of the three feats (Warrior, Sentinel, Alter-man) that you don&#39;t have, or apply a focus to one you do have. This would make the already cool prestige classes cool to have. And would represent the greater understanding of the force.

Sounds like a good option to me, but it might have to be added to get a more "appropriate" name :
> Also things to consider, is the addressing of the Jedi Knight and Jedi Master (and all of the other Force Using prestige classes). Who are they going to interact with this? Do Knights and master get a better recharge rate for Force Power? Does some one with Strong in the Force also get a recharge bonus (I know you talked about this, but I&#39;m just throwing it out there)?

I hadnÂ´t really begun to plan that. Right now, IÂ´m trying to convert more abilities and talents, to get a basis (probably unbalanced, but a basis). But recharge bonuses could be one option. However, that might not be too spectacular, given that Force Power regenerates quite easy already.
If people got the impression that IÂ´m simply stubborn and donÂ´t want to change my idea, IÂ´m sorry, thatÂ´s not what it is. IÂ´m open to suggestions, but the whole point of this project was to create a Force system that I felt represented the Force as I see it. On that basis, is it wrong for me to say "good, but not really what I had in mind"?

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-16 07:22:21)

An idea that may work,
This is straight from *Muntants & Masterminds*, but you maybe able to utilize the system to incorporate a RCR skill system, let me explain.
You would use a system that would give you points, let's call them **Force Power Points**.
So you buy the feat, Force Training (Wis Bonus +1), or heck you can you use any formula, but let's use (Wis bonus + 1) for the example.
You have a 14 Wis, granting you +2 bonus, giving you 3 Power Points
Now with these 3 Power Points you can use 1 Power Point to buy a Force Power for your Suite, or you can use 1 Power Point to give you 5 skill points. Then you can use the skill system of RCR for power powers.
Now, I might not use all of your categories because that's a lot of skill points, but then again you may want a lot of categories to spread the diversity. I might group them up like **BreederofPuppets** was talking about, or you can keep them as they are. The beauty of my solution is that it doesn't matter because you can write the formula to give you more or less points accordingly. There are many possibilities, but the idea will work for any which way you might be thinking.
You could if you want, do a formula or chart which grants you Force Power Points by level. That way its not a stat thing, which I kinda of like because it demonstrates your understanding of the force directly from your force-using class level, but then again some may argue that you should be able to train in the force even though your not a force-using class, hence the feat Force Training (which ever it doesn't matter). So, if you took a non-force using class then you would not get Force Power Points. This would require a progressive chart, or you can say once you pick up the Force Training feat then from there it goes off of your force-user class levels. For example, A 1st level Jedi buy Force Training, that player would receive (5 Force Power Points + Level of Force User Class), Every Force User Class after first you receive 1 Force Power Point. Or you can re-work the Force Power Point formula and just have the Force Training feat.
These are purely examples, I am not looking at how many points you would have at 20 and if you could buy everything, blah blah blah..
This is just a way to introduce skill points into a system that doesn't like the old Skills system, you still need to balance the equation.
As you can see this works great if you can find the balance of Force Power Points granted, Force Powers to buy, and Force Skills to buy.
With this idea you can leave all the Force Powers alone, All the Talents alone and just tweak with the skills.
You are still dealing with the Force Power Suite, but I think its good to run out of powers, because the force points are used to re-use powers and force techniques that are already in place to aid in getting your force points back.
You could still use your Force Power recharging effect, or you can do something more subtle, like this...
If you did want the quicker recharging effect, then you can rule that Force Powers return after 10 rounds no matter if the encounter is still not over.
I really like your idea to use Force Powers when your out of Powers in your Force Power Suite. I think you should allow all Force -Users to use any power in there Suite even if it is exhausted, but the penalty is every time you do use a power that is exhausted from your suite you go down the condition chart (persistent) so you can abuse the recovery talents like equilibrium. This is pretty much what you said, but I'm not using your recharging effect rules, just normal Saga rules with this house rule.
Just some thoughts.

That sounds interesting. But one thing IÂ´m not clear about? Does we still have Force Powers? or Force Skills? or are the Powers like skills in themselves, and you can use skill points to increase your skill with a particaular Power?

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-17 08:54:44)

Yes, We still have Force Powers and we would still use a Force Power Suite to limit the use of Powers.
Every Force Power will have a Force Skill or Skills to activate the different effects of that the Force Power. So you are buying the Force Power for uses per encounter, and you are increasing your Force Skills to be able to activate that Force Power.
I hope you follow...
Here's how I would approach it...
Keep the Force Powers, and create the Force Skills for each Force Power as we discussed earlier.
For example, Let's say "Use the Force" is now Three Skills (for simplicity of the examples sake), Control, Alter, and Sense:
Surge (Control)
Mind Trick(Alter)
I know Move Light Object, Sense Surroundings, Search Your Feelings, Telepathy, Force Trance, Sense Force were part of "Use the Force" and could be used indifinitely. You could do the same thing saying that these are not Force Powers, they are Force Skills that can be used indifinitely. You would just use the appropriate Force Skill. Move Light Object (Alter), Sense Surroundings (Sense), Telepathy (Alter), Force Trance (Control), Sense Force (Sense).
The Actual Force Powers like Surge (Control), Mind Trick (Alter) would be in your Force Power Suite and they would be limited use just like a Force Power Suite is now.
I was also thinking, to activate Force Powers in the higher tiers or even the lower tiers you need to have minimum ranks in multiple Force Skills.
For example, To use Mind Trick you may have to have a minimum rank of Control 5, Alter 7 to use certain abilities listed in Mind Trick like suggestion. You are rolling your alter skill in some situations and your Control skill in others. This brings complexity, but also diversity to the Force Powers.
So you still have to tag each Force Power with a Force Skill or Skills.
I don't know I really think this could work.

I like it <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> . But it still has one of the issues that I was trying to work away. The fact that many Force-users will stand without ability to even try something unless they have specificially trained to do so.
A good example I just recently discovered is Leia. When running around saving the Galaxy with Han, every now and then in all possible situations Han says something like "canÂ´t you try and do that with the Force?". And Leia always tries, sometimes she fails, but sometimes she succeeds. I wouldnÂ´t count on that EU-Jedi Leia has too many Force Powers in her suite, and she still can attempt, and sometimes succeed in all possible uses of the Force.

Well, you can raise the DC by 5 or 10 if they don't meet the prerequisites, or adopt a rule that if you use a Force Point you are considered "trained". It's adaptable. You don't even need to use the prerequisite Force Skills for the Force Powers, that was just a suggestion.
Make it work for your style of play. I just wanted to introduce a way to bring in Force Skills.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-03-16 18:38:25)

Ok, so now IÂ´ve put some serious work down into this, and here is the result:
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The New Force System**</span>
We no longer have one, but six skills related to the Force. These are classed as Force skills and includes the following: Alter(Using the Force to affect the world around you), Control(Controlling the living Force in yourself and using it to strengthen you), Dark Side(Calling upon and using the powers of the Dark Side), Sense(Using the Force to enhance your natural senses, as well as feeling the currents of the Force), Telekinesis(using the Force to move objects with your mind) and Telepathy(Using the Force to communicate mentaly, or link or guide minds together). Each of these skills must be trained separately, and you can also select the Skill Focus feat for them individually. Since they have a very limited selction of skills, and are expected to be using the Force, Skill Training(Any Force skill) is added as a Jedi starting feat.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Force Strength**</span>
Force Strength is a new concept, and pretty much the core in this revision. Basically, it replaces the Force suite as a determinant of how often you can acess the Force. Whenever you us a Force skill in a round, you will need to reduce your Force Strength with one at the end of your turn. You only reduce it by one, regardless of the number of Force skill checks you did. In addition, many applications of Force skills (referred to as Force Powers) has a "cost" in order to use them. For example, if you use a Force Power that costs 2 Force Strength to use, you will pay 2 Force Strength when activating it, and 1 more at the end of your turn, for a total of 3. If you uses the same power twice in a round, the total would be 5. If you go an entire round without using a Force skill (you may still spend Force Points), your Force Strength recovers by 1 at the end of your turn. Your Force Strength recovers fully after 1 minute of rest. If you rolls a natural 20 when using a Force skill, you recovers 3 Force Strength, and if you used a Force Power that cost Force Strength, you does not need to pay for it. The Force is with you!. You may spend a Force Point as a reaction whenever you uses a Force Power in order to reduce its cost by 3 (minimum 0). This does not count against the number of Force Points you can use per round.
Force Strength is gained in a few different ways:
[ul]
[*]The Force Sensitivity and Strong in the Force grants +1 Force Strength each, in addition to their other effects.  
[*]The Force Training feat now gives you 1+Wis modifier Force Strength each time selected.  
[*]Certain talents, techniques and secrets may give you more Force Strength.  
[*]If you wish to use an ability that requires you to pay Force Strength, you may move a number of steps down the Condition Track rather than paying Force Strength at a 1-for-1 ratio. [/ul]  
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**The Force Skills**</span>
Below follows a list of all the Force skills, Force Powers and revisions to talents, techniques and secrets. Next to the names are listed wether they are trained only or not, the time requirement, range, target, Light/Dark Side/Neutral, and Force Strength cost. When a list of DCs are given and a certain DC says "Trained Only" or "Costs 2 Force Strength", then add those to the information in the title, and use until a subsequent DC changes it. If a Force Power says that you can maintain it, you can do so by spending the specified action type at the beginning of each turn you wish to maintain it. If you maintains a power, you will need to pay its cost at the same time as you spend the action, and you may not regain Force Strength by not using a Force skill that turn.
***Advanced Force Powers***
Some Force Powers are more uncommon than others, oftenly requiring a higher understanding of the Force. Examples of these are Force Absord and Force Destruction, powers normally only known by experienced Jedi Masters or Sith Lords. The GM may decide that some Force Powers are beyind the reach of a character, and require that the character either receives training from a more experienced master, or aquires a higher level of skill with the Force (Skill Focus, Higher Level) before he can use that specific Force Power. Otherwise, the GM might rule that some events in a characters past or personality, makes it easier for him to channel the Force in certain ways.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Alter**</span>
[hide]**Influence Mind(Trained Only, Standard Action, 6 squares, 1 creature, Neutral, 3 Force Strength)**
You can use the Force to influence someones mind, to make them more willing to follow your suggestions. Make a skill check and compare it to the Will Defense of your opponent. If your skill check equals or exceeds his Will Defense, then you can make a previously unreasonable suggestion seem perfectly reasonable to the target. The suggestion cannot threater the targets life in any obvious way, and you must have some way of successfully communicating with the target. After he has carried out your command, the target will not realize that what he did was unreasonable. As you are only influencing the targets mind, you can only give short instructions that donÂ´t span over greater time periods. If you spend a Force Point, you may influence the targets attitude towards you with a number of step equal to 1+1 for every 5 your skill check beat his Will Defense with.
**Blinding(Trained Only, Standard Action, n/a, 6 square-radius around you, Light Side, 2 Force Strength)**
You can use the Force to create a blinding flash of light that temporarily renders your opponents blinded. Make a skill check and compare it to the Will Defense of all opponents in a 6 square radius around you. All opponents whos Will Defense your check equaled or exceeded are considered blind until the beginning of your next round.
**Disable Droid/Veichle(Trained Only, Standard Action, 6 squares and LOS, 1 droid or veichle, Neutral, 1 Force Strength)**
You can use the Force to overload and shut down the electrical systems of droids. Make a skill check and compare it to the Damage Threshold of the droid. If your check equals or exceeds his Damage Threshold, then he moves 1 step down the Condition Track, and another for every 5 points you beat his Damage Treshold with. You can spend a Force Point to move him 1 additional step down the Condition Track.
**Force Distraction(Trained Only, Swift Action, 12 squares and LOS, see text, Neutral, optional cost of 1 Force Strength)**
You can create a distraction that gives you the necessary time to make a Stealth check, or that can serve as a lure to draw opponents away. Make a skill check and compare it to the Will Defense of the affected opponents. If your check equals or exceeds their Will Defense, then they become temporarily distracted. You may affect all opponents within a 2x2 square area or 3 opponents, wichever is the lowest. You may spend a Force Point to increase the area to 4x4 and the maximum number of opponents to 6. You can also use this power against a single opponent in order to receive the benefits of feinting in combat. This application costs 1 Force Strength.
**Force Healing(Standard Action, touch, 1 living creature, Light Side, 3 Force Strength)**
DC 15: Your target recovers Hp equal to your level.
DC 20 (Trained Only): As DC 15, but the target recovers Hp equal to twice your level.
DC 25 (Costs 4 Force Strength): As DC 20, but the target recovers Hp equal to three times your level, and also moves +1 step on the Condition Track.
DC 30 (Costs 5 Force Strength): As DC 25, but the target moves +3 steps up the Condition Track
A character may only be affected by this power once per hour from a specific individual. He may receive it from multiple Force users though.
**Force Light(Trained Only, Full-Round Action, 6 squares or present at site, 1 Dark Side spirit, object or site, Light Side, 20 Force Strength)**
You may attempt to drive away the prescense of the Dark Side in a location or object. Make a skill check. If it exceeds the Will Defense of the object or location, you can reduce the prescense of the Dark Side by one step. You may also use this against a Dark Side Spirit. If your check exceeds the Will Defense of the spirit, then he will take damage equal to your skill check result. Any number of Force Sensitives that is trained in Alter and has no Dark Side Score may attempt to aid you in using this power. For every person sucessfully using aid another on you, this power costs one less Force Strength to use.
**Force Stun(Trained Only, Standard Action, 6 squares and LOS, 1 creature, Neutral, 1 Force Strength)**
You can use the Force to overload the neural systems of a creaure to paralyze it. Make a skill check and compare it to the Damage Threshold of the creature. If your check equals or exceeds his Damage Threshold, then he moves 1 step down the Condition Track, and another for every 5 points you beat his Damage Treshold with. You can spend a Force Point to move him 1 additional step down the Condition Track.[/hide]
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Control**</span>
[hide]**Battle Strike(Swift Action, n/a, yourself, Neutral)**
DC 10: You gain a +1d6 Force Bonus to damage on your next attack.

DC 20: As DC 15, but you gain a +2d6 bonus to damage.
DC 25: As DC 20, but you gain a +3d6 bonus to damage.
DC 30 (Costs 5 Force Strength): As DC 25, but you gain score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
You may expend a Force Point to add an extra 2d6 damage to your next attack.
**Block(Reaction, n/a, any number of melee attacks directed at you, Neutral)**
You can use the Force to anticipate attacks, and intercept them. The exact details of the block is based upon what you uses to block. Whenever targeted by a melee attack made by a weapon of up to one size larger than you, you may make a skill check. If your skill check exceeds the attack roll of the attack, then you takes no damage. You can also use this power against melee area attacks. If you succeed, you take only half damage from the attack. For every time you uses this power, or the Deflect power, in the same round, you takes a -5 cumulative penalty to your next skill check to activate any of those powers again before the start of your next round. You may spend a Force Point to use this power to protect an adjacent ally. If you uses this power and the Deflect power a combined number of times that is 5 or more, then you must pay 1 Force Strength for every 5 times you uses them. In order to be able to use this power, you need some effect (the Jedi Block talent for example) that tells you the details of when you can use it.
**Breath Control(Standard Action, n/a, yourself, Neutral, 1 Force Strength)**
You can use the Force to sustain the air in your lungs, keeping you safe from inhaled toxins and keeping you alive underwater. If you suceed on a DC 15 check, you do not need to make an Endurance check to hold your breath for as long as you choose to maintain this power. You can maintain it as a move action. If you spend a Force Point on activation, you may maintain it as a swift action.
**Deflect(Reaction, n/a, any number of ranged attacks directed at you, Neutral)**
You can use the Force to anticipate attacks, and intercept them. The exact details of the deflection is based upon what you uses to deflect. Whenever targeted by a ranged attack made by an energy weapon of up to one size larger than you, you may make a skill check. If your skill check exceeds the attack roll of the attack, then you takes no damage. You can also use this power against ranged area attacks. If you succeed, you take only half damage from the attack. If you also have cover, you takes no damage on a successfull deflection. This power also works against the Force Lightning power. For every time you uses this power, or the Block power, in the same round, you takes a -5 cumulative penalty to your next skill check to activate any of those powers again before the start of your next round. You may spend a Force Point to use this power to protect an adjacent ally. If you uses this power and the Block power a combined number of times that is 5 or more, then you must pay 1 Force Strength for every 5 times you uses them. In order to be able to use this power, you need some effect (the Jedi Deflect talent for example) that tells you the details of when you can use it.
**Dissipate Energy(Trained Only, Reaction, n/a, one attack that deals energy damage to you, Neutral, 3 Force Strength)**
Whenever you are hit by an attack and would take energy damage, you may make an opposed checks. If your check equals or exceeds the damage you would have taken, then you negate the damage. If you spend a Force Point, you may heal an amount of Hp equal to the damage you would have taken, or up to your maximum Hp, wichever is lower.
**Force Absorb(Trained Only, Reaction, n/a, yourself, Light Side)**
When you successfully uses Force Defense (see below) and defeats your opponents roll by 5 or more, you may choose to regain 3 Force Strength instead of returning the power. If you spend a Force Point, you may regain 3 Force Strength and still return the power.
**Force Defense(Reaction, n/a, one Force Power or talent that affects you directly, Neutral)**
When an opponent uses the Force in a way that targets you directly, you may make an opposed roll. If you check equals or exceeds you opponents, then you successfully negates the effect. If your skill check beats his by 5 or more, you may use the same Force application against him, at the same power level as he did, and at half cost in Force Strength.

DC 25, As DC 20, but you gainsa +1 Force bonus to your Fortitude Defense.
If you spend a Force Point on activation, you may consider yourself to be of Adult age for the purposes of removing age penalties.
**Healing Trance(Trained Only, Full-Round Action, n/a, yourself, Neutral)**
You can enter a meditative trance in order to help yourself survive without food and water, and to accelerate the healing of your wounds. By a DC 10 skill check you may enter the trance. You remain fully aware of your surroundings while in this trance, and you may leave it as a free action. While in the trance, you are treated as helpless. While in trance, you can go 10 times as long without food and water as normal (then you have to start making Endurance checks), and you also recovers a number of Hp equal to your character level per hour, and every hour you stay in the trance counts as 2 hours of normal rest. By increasing the DC to 15, you may also recover from any persistent conditions after spending 8 consecutive hours in trance, although some conditions may not be affected by this, as decided by the GM.
**Redirect Shot(Trained Only, Reaction, LOS, ranged attack that you have deflected, Neutral, 1 Force Strength)**
You can use the Force to more efficiently deflect an attack, aiming it against another opponent. When sucessfully using the Deflect power, you may make a ranged attack roll against a target to wich you have line of sight. If you hit, the attack deals normal weapon damage to the target. If you had a penalty to your skill check to use the Deflect power, then that penalty applies to your attack roll as well. When determining distance penalties for the attack roll, count the distance to the target only, not the distance the bolt has traveled to reach you. However, the sum of the distance from the boltÂ´s origin, to you, and to the new target may not exceed the weapons maximum range. In order to be able to use this power, you need some effect (the Jedi Redirect Shot talent for example) that tells you the details of when you can use it.[/hide]
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Dark Side (Requires a Dark Side Score of 1 or more in in order to train in)**</span>
[hide]**Dark Healing(Standard Action, 6 squares, 1 creature, Dark Side, Increases Dark Side Score by 1 on useage, 5 Force Strength)**
You may use the Force to draw the life from another living being, and use it to heal your own body. Make a ranged attack roll, but use your skill modifier instead of your normal attack bonus. If the attack hits, your target takes 1d6 Force damage per your class level in Sith Apprectice/Lord, up to a maximum of 10d6, and you heals an equal amount. You must have the Dark Healing talent from the Sith tree in order to use this power.
**Dark Rage(Swift Action, n/a, yourself, Dark Side, Increases Dark Side Score by 1 on useage)**
DC 10: You gain a +1 Dark Side bonus to your attack and damage rolls for your next melee attack.
DC 15: As DC 10, but you gains a +2 bonus.
DC 20 (Trained Only): As DC 15, but you gains a +4 bonus.
DC 25: As DC 20, but you increases the damage dice of your weapon by 1 size for your next melee attack.

You can spend a Force Point to have the benefits of this power last for the remainder of the encounter. While this power is active, you cannot perform actions that requires concentration or patience. Wich these are is decided by the GM, but examples are Mechanics, Stealth and Treat Injury checks or using most Light Side powers.
**Dark Transfer(Standard Action, Touch, 1 creature, Dark Side, 2 Force Strength)**
**Drain Knowledge(Trained Only, Full-Round Action, 6 squares, 1 creature, Dark Side, Increases Dark Side Score by 1 on useage, 10 Force Strength)**
You can use the Force to rip out knowledge from the mind of another being, as well as erase the knowledge from their minds. Make a skill check and compare it to the Will Defense of your opponent. If your skill check equals or exceeds his Will Defense, you may learn any piece of information regarding a certain subject, or a specific memory from his mind. If the target would be willing to allow you to find the information, he gains a +5 bonus to his Will Defense, but if he would resist, he gains a +5 to his Will Defense. You can also use this ability to gain access to a Knowledge skill the target possesses. If your check beat his Will Defense by 5 or more, you gain the ability to make all skill checks in a Knowledge skill in wich the target is trained untrained, or to gain understanding of a language the target knows. You may spend a Force Point to make this newly gained effect permanent, or to erase the gained information from a subjects mind. If you do, the target will take a -10 Dark Side penalty to all skill checks relating that subject.
**Dun MÃ¶ch(Trained Only, Free Action, 6 squares, same as Fear, Dark Side, 1 Force Strength)**
When sucessfully using the Fear power, you may make a Persuasion check. If your check result equals or exceeds the characters (modified) Will Defense, he must increase his Dark Side score by 1 whenever he wishes to spend a Force Point or spends more than 5 Force Strength at once, and by 2 whenever he wishes to spend a Destiny point. This power requires the Temptation class feature of the Sith Lord class to be used.
**Force Destruction(Trained Only, Full-Round Action, 12 squares, 4 square burst radius, Dark Side, Increases Dark Side Score by 1 on useage, 5 Force Strength)**
You can call upon the Dark Side of the Force to unleash a powerful attack that explodes in a large area. Designate a center of effect no more than 12 squares away. Treat this power as an area attack that deals 6d6 Force Damage on a hit against anyone one within a 4-square burst radius. This power is very debilitating for the user, and evey time he uses it, he moves 1 step down on the condition track, and gains a persistent condition that can only be removed by restoring his Force Strength to full. If you spends a Force Point, you may have this power ignore the effects of the Evasion talent.
**Fear(Trained Only, Standard Action, 6 squares, 1 creature or all within a 12-square radius around you, Dark Side, Increases Dark Side Score by 1 on useage)**
You can instill fear and doubt into your opponents. Make a skill check and compare to the Will Defense of your opponent. If your skill check equals or exceeds his Will Defense, then he suffers a -1 penalty to all attack rolls, defenses and skill checks, and an additional -1 for every 10 you beat his Will Defense with. This penalty lasts for the remainder of the encounter, or until he has had a chance to rest outside of combat for 1 minute, wichever comes first. The affected creature may increase his Dark Side Score by 1 to negate this effect as a swift action. You may spend a Force Point to have this power affect all opponents within a 12-square radius around you.
**Force Grip(Standard Action, 6 squares and LOS, 1 creature, Dark Side)**
You can use the Force to mercilessly put a chokehold on an opponents vital organs or airways, inflicting great pain. Make a skill check and compare it to the Damage Treshold of your opponent. If your skill check equals or exceeds his Damage Treshold, he may only take a swift action for every round he remains under your hold. Even if your skill check did not overcome his Damage Treshold, he still takes 2d6 points of damage for as long as he remains under your hold. You can maintain your Force Grip as a standard action, but you will need to make a new skill check each round. If you takes damage while maintaining it, you must immediately make a new check, but you take a penalty to your check equal to the damage taken. You may spend a Force Point to increase the damage done to 4d6.
**Force Lightning(Trained Only, Standard Action, 6 squares and LOS, 1 creature, Dark Side, 2 Force Strength)**
Make a skill check and compare it to your opponents Reflex Defense. If your skill check equals or exceeds his Reflex Defense, he takes 4d6 points of Force Damage and moves -1 step down the Condition Track. By expending more Force Strength, you can make this power more potent. You may spend 1 Force Strength to increase the damage by 1 dice, up to a maximum of 10d6. You may also spend 3 Force Strength to move him one additional step down the Condition Track. By spending a Force Point, you increases the size of the damage dice of this power to d8s.
**Sith Alchemy(Trained Only, 1minute, n/a, 1 creature or object, Dark Side, Increases Dark Side Score by 1 on useage, see text)**
You can use the Force to manipulate matter and even living organisms. In order to perform Sith Alchemy, you need to pay the listed price for the modification you wishes to make, as well as clear the listed skill check. You must also spend a Force Point. Everytime you uses Sith Alchemy, you loses all Force Strength you have, and if you currently do not have enough to perform the specific Alchemy you wish, then you cannot perform it. You will also need special equipment, wich can be both hard to find and expensive. Each repeated use of Sith Alchemy on the same target increases the DC by 5. You need the Sith Alchemy talent to use this Force Power.

You may maintain this power as a Standard Action, but if you takes damage while doing so, you must suceed at a new check at DC Damage taken + 1/5 of the DC to lift the object.

IÂ´ll se with my players, and I might possibly even start a new, Force-heavy game just to test this.

> Damnit, I was so hoping &quot;*Force Coolness*&quot; would make it&#39;s way into this&#8230;

Well, IÂ´m going to need to change Serenity somehow, and maybe offer something for all the tier II Force using PrCs. So, please, suggestions are always welcome.

### **Frost** (2008-04-16 11:25:48)

Are all these new skills still based off your CHA stat or does each skill have diff stat?
Also do Jedi get more starting skills now since thier one main skill has been broken into six?
Also you don't have deflect/block listed under any of your force skills.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-04-16 15:54:54)

They are all based on Charisma. However, all mental stats are important to be really strong in the Force. Int to get more skills, Wis to get more Force Strength and Cha to get a higher skill mod.
Jedi will receive a free Skill Training(Any Force skill that they qualify for) as a starting feat. I feel this will be the most balanced solution.
Deflect/Block will be coming up soon, but they will work exactly the same as before, using the Control skill.

You know, this thread defies efforts to find it in the search function :P
Having come across your easier to read Scribd document I've become interested in this system. I'd like to ask: would talents, powers and class features - especially those in all the extra books be imported unchanged into your system?

That´s a work in progress. Of course all things that don´t concern the Force will remain unchanged, but those things that do I´ll look through manually. As a general rule of thumb, anything that does not affect a specific power, mentions the Use the Force skill or the Force suite, or allows you to regain lost powers will be unaffected. The rest will be looked over by me and converted as needed.
Currently I am working on the Knights of the Old Republic campaign guide (since it makes sense for my campaign) and after that I´ll get to work on the massive Jedi Academy Training Manual at the request of my players. It is however, proceeding at a slow pace due to RL.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-09-19 16:53:02)

I see, do you have a set system of conversion or is it based of your own judgement and study of the mechanics?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-09-19 16:54:47)

I do it manually on a case-to-case basis, that´s why it takes some time.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-09-19 17:28:56)

Kk then. I wish ye well in RL and look forward to your progress <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Thraken** (2009-11-08 08:34:09)

Impatience stikes!
I'm randomly coming up with an improvised conversion to something between the Saga system and your system rebuild. Specifically copying your Force Strength, Skills and Affinity system in Saga and tacking on broad stuff to work with current and possible future force powers.
Hows about
> Using a Force Power with a minimum DC of 15 or no DC and has single target consumes one Force Strength
> Using a Force Power with a minimum DC of 20 or no DC and the ability to affect more than one target consumes two Force Strength.
> Using a Force talent that requires a Force Point to activate expends two Force Strength and is considered using a Force Skill
> Using an ability that consumes a Destiny Point expends all your Force Strength.
> Powers with the [Lightsaber form] descriptor their expenditure reduced by one.
> Lightsaber related talents are not considered uses of a Force Skill unless the description explicitly requires a Force Skill check. e.g. Deflect, Lightsaber Throw.

If that works, then all that's needed is to tag Powers and some talents with the appropriate skill and adjust those talents that mess with force powers.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-11-09 01:24:17)

Actually, I had planned to drop the development of this thing. I feel that I´ve lost my initiative to keep working with it, and I also have a few other projects consuming my time.
But that seemed good.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-11-09 03:22:47)

Ah well, it happens.
There are good ideas in there, and should it look like there are enough unattached people around, an interest check may appear.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-11-20 09:43:46)

I do return.
In this partial deconstruction of the Force System I looked back at some of the old RCR stuff. Two or three points come to mind
First, I'm wondering whether I should adopt the RCR style ability relation to the Force skills - that is Wisdom for Sense and Telepathy, Intelligence for Alter and Telekinetics and Constitution for Control. It doesn't really serve any purpose other than slightly mixing up the force stats a bit more.
I'm also considering keeping Use the Force as an untrainable skill attributed to Charisma for the Force skills, powers and such which don't fall under any of the five above categories. This in addition to force affinity would serve as a gauge of their innate connection to the force rather than learned skill.
Second, under your draft and with the change from RCR to Saga skill system there's no limit to the number of force powers one can learn. Will probably tie ablity mods to the Force Sensitivity and Force Training feats.
