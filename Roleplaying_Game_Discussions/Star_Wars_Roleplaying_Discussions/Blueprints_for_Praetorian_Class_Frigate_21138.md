# Blueprints for Praetorian Class Frigate

Anyone know where they might have a blue print of the decks on this Capital Ship? I've been looking every where and just cannot seem to find anything.

Hmm, I donÂ´t know. How detailed do you have to be? Perhaps you could use the schematics for the Hammerhead ships, as those were the sucessors of the Praetorian.

I was thinking of using this in an upcoming game so I would have to have a general layout of the ship. The Hammer head deck plans would work are they listed on the web somewhere?

Not sure where to find full schematics, here are the layout of the *Harbinger*, the warship from KOTORII.

Thanks DA, after seeing the deck plan I might have to change things a little though.
