# Starships and Roles

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-01-04 20:32:51)

Something **They call me Bob** said in the "New Book" thread got me thinking about star ships (specifically combat vehicles, but otherwise as well) and the roles they should fill. It has been stated that the basics of space combat in Star Wars is based off WWII air and naval battles. It certainly fits with huge battle ships hammering away at each other while bomber aircraft soar between fighter plane duels, all the while silent u-boats slip unnoticed under the ocean's glassy surface.
I mean, how different is this from two Star Destroyers shredding the sky with their thundering turbo-lasers at each other while fighters and bomber slash and parry in a deadly melee of lasers and proton torpedoes, while cloaked missile tugs slink invisible through space, until they are in the prefect position to launch their deadly payload? Aside from the size, I mean.
And so the reason of my post is threefold:
[ul][*]First I am curious to see which style of ship represents what style of space ship.  
[*]Second, I would like to you if there are any direct reflections between WWII aircraft and Star Wars, i.e. the X-wing is the Rebel version of a Japanese Zero.  
[*]And finally, if I was to run a game to more closely mirror space combat and WWII naval and air warfare, what kind of advise would you give me?[/ul]

Well, my first bit of advice would be to LET ME PLAY IN IT. Seriously, starships have always been one of my major nerd factors about this series. I really hate how they didn't get the same emphasis in Episode III, especially after seeing the Battle over Coruscant.
I really like the Miniatures Starship Battles rule about fighter deployment. It really shows the dependant relationship the smaller craft have with carriers. This is different from the movies, where you can see Luke going off on his own tangent in an X-Wing and nearly all the Rebellion craft in the Battle of Endor are pre-launched.
Really think you hit the nail on the head there in pegging each type of craft down. I'd also suggest wings of fighters, to form tactical attacks and do things like protect other craft (like bombers).

I have been thinking about this topic again, and now have serious problems with the current space combat rules. No, I am *not* trying to make the Saga rules fit the movies.
Star Wars space battles, especially the original movies (*A New Hope, Empire Strike Back*, and *Return of the Jedi*), were inspired by World War II movies. The current rules do not look like anything in World War II.
First and foremost, airplaces, especially fighter-bombers, were feared by the big ships. Aircraft carriers were so dangerous because of the planes they carried. A few well placed bombs, and even a battleship was sinking. Toward the end of WWII, the naval battle tactics consisted of getting your aircraft within range of the enemy ship, and keeping enemy planes (fighters and bombers alike) away from your own carriers.
In Saga, fighters and bombers are no threat to capital ships, and even capital ships have a incredibly difficult time harming each other. For example, the Imperial I class Star Destroyers have 150 SR, where the proton torpedo deals only 9d10x2 (a range from 18 to 180 points of damage) With maximum damage on a non-critical hit, only 10 points of damage will pass the Star Destroyer's 20 DR. So, on a lucky hit (X-Wings require an 8 on a d20 to hit a Star Destroyer), a lucky damage roll (.0000001% chance, if I did my math right), it would deal 0.005% of the Star Destoyer's hit points, ant it carries only 6 torpedeos. Meanwhile, a Star Destroyer's point defense guns hit on a 5, deal 2d10x2 (which lower the SR with an average damage roll), and have unlimited shots.
No, am X-Wing, by itself, should not be able to kill a Star Destroyer. But it should be able to *hurt* it.
There are a lot of things that I think ought to be adjusted in order to bring the current Saga space combat rules more inline with WWII fighting. More of that on my next post.

well the only thing to consider are starship maneuvers, which in SotG all skilled or better crews get.
You could give a fighter pilot skim the surface, or shield hit, allowing you to bypass or weaken the shields.
Now if 6 x-wings became a fighter group, they would gain +10 atk, for a total of 17. Now if they used shield hit, they would on average exceed the SD's ref by 10, and reduce the SR by 15 + 5 if they exceeded SR. That's significant. The problem is you are thinking of a LONE starfighter taking on a capital ship, almost unheard of (a lvl 20 pilot could pull it off though). There's a reason starfighters attack in large groups, and maneuvers + fighter groups makes taking down that SD so much more possible.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-08-27 00:50:12)

Right. Okay, here we go:
Star Wars space combat is based off WWII naval battles. Battleships, fighters, bombers, aircraft carrirs, submarines, destoyers, etc, etc. Saga doesn't reflect this. There are several reasons, and I hope I address most of them here:
**Proton Torpedeos**
Oringinally, this nasty bits of destructive power were anti-capital ship weapons (meaning in the d6 Star Wars). Air-to-water torpedeos, for example. Or simply bombs. Either way, how they went from being ship killers to the Star Wars equivilant to sidewinder air-to-air missiles I blame on the Expanded Universe, and reality. Missiles are most commonly seen on modern jets, and jet movies. Jet movies don't show them using missiles to kill ship, but other jets. Hence, when novel writers wanted a shiny space fighter scene, you had to have shiny missiles (re: proton torpedeos) being fired at other space fighters. Fighters wre not used against capital ships, it seems.
But this begs to the question: if proton torpedeos are only effective against other fighters, why send fighters out there at all? Why not just ignore the fighters, and rip their capital ship a new one?
**Star Destoyers- Battleship or Carriers? Both of course**
I think Star Destroyers are closer to *dreadnoughts*/carriers than to battleship/carriers. What's the differnece? According to wikipedia, a battleship had a descent amount of big guns (the USS Iowa-class battleships have nine 16 inch guns) and some smaller ones (twenty 5 inch guns) and a host of anit-air assets (eighty 40mm anti-aircraft guns, and forty-nine 20mm anti-aircraft guns). A dreadnought (actually as sub-class of battleships) had lots of medium sized guns (ranging from ranging from 10 to 12 inch in size, and numbering up to 10 or more), plus a host of smaller guns (as the normal battleships, most of these were anti-aircraft weaponry). Dreadnoughts were designed for shorter ranged battles, were faster, more accurate lead slung across the cean was better than slower, not so accurate artillary.
Both were humbled by planes, but the way. And this was after they wre reeling from the knuckle sadwhich submarines gave them.
Look at the movies. Star Destroyers sent out lots and lots of fire as opposed to a few heavy shots every little while. So, to me, they are more like dreadnoughts with fighter bays than out-and-out battleships.
**Fighters make movies, bombers make *history***
I love X-wings. I loved them when I was a kid, and I love them now. I like TIE fighters. I even like A-wings. I really, really lke the way ARC-170 looks. Absolutely incredible. But fighters didn't win navy battles. Bombers did. At Coral Sea, two American carriers sent 54 dive bombers, 21 torpedo bombers, and 24 fighters to strike the Japanese fleet. That's 75 bombers with 1/3 that number as escorts.
But, as it is, bombers (at least those armed with proton torpedeos) aren't effective against (armed and sheilded) capital ships. So...why bother having them?
**Radar**
Radar play such an important role I just can't explain. See...the Allied Powers (Britian, I think, was first in the 'workable' department) got the radar first. This meant the Allied could find enemy craft when they couldn't see them. Everyone else had to send scouts out to look for them. Whole fleets could be missed on a cloudy day.
Radar is how the America forces dropped in on the Japanesse fleet while their planes were refueling and vulerable.
Everyone in Star Wars has a radar or other sensors. This...I don't know if it really matters or not, really, for what I am trying to do. It's late. Yeah, I'll blame that.

I think the book, while wonderful, was a band-aid on a amputation. I am looking for something more now.
> The problem is you are thinking of a LONE starfighter taking on a capital ship, almost unheard of (a lvl 20 pilot could pull it off though).

To this I say:

You are very right. A single craft should not be a threat to one of these super-carriers. But even group of six would be hard pressed to deal a good amount of damage before they are wiped out.
> You could give a fighter pilot skim the surface, or shield hit, allowing you to bypass or weaken the shields.

A skilled crew, they could really attempt *Skim the Surface* only once. And I do mean attempt (+7 manuever bonus on a DC 20 check, and a failed result has the whole wing smashing into the Star Destroyer). Anti-ship fire would rip the wing apart, if the TIE's didn't. And then you have all those turbo-lasers that can actually hit on a 20.
Now, the thing I am looking for is the WW II feel. Lots of planes (star fighters) biting the big one before a carrier (Star Destroyer) finally sinks is appropriate. That should be because the bombers get shredded before they reach their target, not because they are effectively dropping toilet paper on a tank.
"Starship maneuvers as the answer" really annoys me. Not because they're bad (they're really cool as far as I can tell), but because their optional. Their add-ons. And they aren't required in the base game. Take a level 15 soldier with the heavy weapons proficiency feat, +20 skill and he is a damn fine fighter pilot. But he can't do what you just described. He is still stuck banging away futility at the hull and shields of a Star Destroyer.

well, ships in WWII didn't have shields.
Another problem with your comparison is range in starwars is much longer, not only because they use different weapons, but also because they are just different.
ok, skim the surface is only recommended for high lvl pcs then. but shield hit is effective. And honestly, if WWII ships had shields, do you think the japanese could have simply rammed them to death with 1 fighter? And honestly, compared to SW ships, WWII ships would have horribly low hp.
Your example involves 1 fighter, what if he was in a fighter group? if even one of the people in that fighter group had squadron leader talents, it would be a very different game. I honestly would never expect anything less than a lvl 20 to take on a SD, maybe lower if they were a skilled pilot.
Now, in game mechanics, if you use a lot of fighters, you can defeat (possibly destroy) an SD.

> read my disagreement again.

I was writing the next post before I noticed you commented on the first one of the night. Hell, I didn't think anyone would be awake at this hour.
I also noted that the way I started my...uh...other post, sounded like I was responding to what you said. Whcih iwasn't, because I was already writing a post, and didn't see yours until I after I finsihed. Sorry about that.
And, on a funny note, I was going to clarify what I meant and when I meant it like so:
*"See, I didn't see your disagreement to my first post, because I was writing my second post at the time you wrote your disagreement. Only, I started this thread, and so my second post was really my thrid post, and my third post- that's the second one tonight- is really my fourth post. Now, I just got done responding to your first post which diagreed with my first post- the tonight first post, not all together first post (and I'm only counting this thread as far as posts are concerned)- and posted it, makeing that my fourth or fifth post. This is my sixth or seventh post, depending on when you started counting. Unless I missed a post or two in there, in which case I am really off. But anyway, I write slow, so I didn't get to your post- that's the disagreement post, which was your first post- until just a minute ago. Sorry about that. But I got my seventh or eigth post up…wait, no, my sixth or seventh post. Maybe."*
Needless to say, I went with something that confused me less...

Very true. But their size was smaller than WWII vessels, and their weapons were not as damaging, etc, etc. As far as I am concerned, everything was scaled up from WWII to Star Wars, and should have scaled up evenly. They didn't, per the rules.
> ok, skim the surface is only recommended for high lvl pcs then. but shield hit is effective. And honestly, if WWII ships had shields, do you think the japanese could have simply rammed them to death with 1 fighter? And honestly, compared to SW ships, WWII ships would have horribly low hp.

Why not? It happened in *Return of the Jedi*.
In WWII, some 2,800 aircraft attempted to ram Allied ships. Many hit. Few (the number ranges from 39 to 80) ships were disabled or sunk. Kamikaze was not an effective tactic back then, either. Like in Star Wars, you have to fly the fighter into the offending capital ship in the right spot.

Let me first say I don't mind the Saga space system. It works well for what is does. What my goal here is to adjust it to closer match the WWII style of battle, while keeping with the speed and fast action of Star Wars. I don't think Saga did this.
I agree with you in that, in a normal game, a Star Destroyer is a prop, and not a legetimate target for PC's. PC's no mess with these big baddie's without some McGruffin device or flaw presented (like, say, a small exhaust port that ran all the way down to the energy core).
What I am crafting isn't a normal Saga game. I want to adjust the whole Space Combat section to get it closer to WWII. Here, I do want Star Destroyers to be possible, defeatible targets, yet not turn them into cardboard targets.
And yeah, I want to make a game where the rebels launch their entire fleet to attack a Death Star. And I want the fighters to actually matter in that battle, without resulting to being used as a screen, or requiring a McGruffin.
> Now, in game mechanics, if you use a lot of fighters, you can defeat (possibly destroy) an SD.

"A thousand goblins will kill anything" is a phrase a freind of mine always used. I encourage the idea of a small group of fighters and fighter-bombers getting wiped out when attacking something they shouldn't. But when you literally need hundreds of thousands to kill, and thousands just to damage, a capital ship...well, it doesn't fit into what I am looking for.

The executor's shields were down, which means that it would've taken a ton of damage, and then the a-wing disabled it. In the mean time, the ship was caught in the death star's gravity and crashed.
Actually, a very small group of 30 x-wings would easily take down a SD. probably less, but I've never playtested it. They would group into 5 fighter groups, and pound the SD over an over, while the SD may kill a few (having to get 2 nat 20's against 1 target), overall the x-wings will win.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-08-27 20:59:16)

I was writing up a big ol' fight, usuing just average rolls (10 on a d20 for attacks), but realised that would be a waste. Here is a quick run down.
**This was not Fun:**
[hide]Round 1
Started out a 40 squares away, with the X-Wings going first. They closed the distance (16 squares, closing the range to 34), while the SD fired Promity salvos uselessly (couldn't make the DC 10 roll). I am assuming the +2 per gun in a battery does not apply to Promity Spread attacks, and ship mounted weapons aren't considered braced for auto-fire.
Round 2
X-Wings close again, even though they are within range with their torps (average attack roll would be less than the SD's Refelx Def). Range 8 squares. The SD did some nasty work with the Promity Spread, dishings out 35 points of damage per X-wing (about 60 points of damage per fighter, minus 15 for shields, and 10 for DR) and dropped their sheilds to SR 10. Oh, and the SD moved 3 squares away. Range 11, now.
Round 3
I quit here. The X-wings could have attacked with the torps (attack roll 20) but, scoring now extra hits, only would, on average, deal about 90 points of damage. This is not enough to break through the SD sheilds. All 30 would be ineffective with just average rolls. So, instead, they double in 8 squares making the range 3.
The SD would have a hayday, now. It moves in 3 squares, making range 0 (the SD pilot fails, but all the X-Wings easily avoid the collision). Another 60 point hit per fighter (attack roll 17, and dealing another 40 points per X-wing, bringing their damage up to 75 out of 120, SR is now 5). Ion cannons would miss, as would the tractor beams, but the PD batteries, with promity spread, would deal 20 points for 4 of the 5 groups (dropping the X-wing SR to 0), dealing 5 more points of damage to those four groups (so 1 wing has SR 5 and 75 damage, and the other four have SR 0, and 80 damage).
Round 4
The X-wings keep it at range 0 (the DC 15 check is easy for them) and another massive, largerely ineffective torp barrage (attack roll is 25, beating the def by 7, and scoring 2 more hits. That's 90 more points of damage for each group) yet this time dealing damage (180 total, minus 150 for sheilds, and another 20 for DR, means the first one deals 10, the second 15, third 20, fourth 25, and the fifth 30. Total damage is 90 points of damage). Biggest win? SR drops by 25 to SR 125.
The SD unleashes another layer of hell. It hits with it's Turbolasers (Promity Spread, deals half damage- which is still 60). This means 50 goes to four of the five groups making them into itty-bitty bits of space dust, and 45 gets to the others (they also lose the last of their SR, and onlu have 10 hp left). But hey, none move down the damage track (46 damage threshold!)
Any left over get hooked up by the ion cannon batteries which should waste all of them (75 avaerage ion damage, 35 of which sticks around).
The PD batteries have fun blasting away any floating peices.[/hide]
So...if we were to test this, than I think we need to make some actual rolls, lay down some rules (use this book, and that book, have this many heroes, this level of heroes, and start at this range), and play it out. I personally think one Star Destoyer would lay waste to as many as 60 (ten wings) of X-Wings, without TIE fighter support. Or at least, that battle would be close.

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-27 21:14:05)

my question, did you group them into fighter groups (increasing damage)? And did you use vehicular combat? (essentially would've kept them alive). And here's a weird loophole I found, it says when attakc you can designate a ship operated by a generic crew, meaning that even if you use area attacks you designate 1 target to take damage (max is x-wings hp)

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-08-27 23:10:14)

> my question, did you group them into fighter groups (increasing damage)?

Yes. It only inceases damage the same way a Narrow Salvo (that is, normal battery rules) does. In the quick example, they scored one hit over the target's defense, gaining two additional 'hits' per shot. That's the only way they exceeded the sheilds.
> And did you use vehicular combat? (essentially would&#39;ve kept them alive).

No, I did not. I only used Fighter Wings and the battery rules from Starships of the Galaxy.Vehicular Combat might have helped a little, at least at first (when the attack rolls on the X-Wings were 10 to 17), but as they only have a +7 in Pilot, anything that would have hit then dead on would have gotten around vechilar combat (average rolls, and all).
> And here&#39;s a weird loophole I found, it says when attakc you can designate a ship operated by a generic crew, meaning that even if you use area attacks you designate 1 target to take damage (max is x-wings hp)

Proximity Spread is an area effect attack that effects everyone in a single square. Being in a fighter wing requires entering and staying in a square. Hence, no designation required, and everyone gets blasted.

hmm, I see. I guess the only thing worth thinking about is putting lvl 5 heroics in the x-wings, and giving them evasion.
hmm, ok, well let's try a different (and maybe unfair) tactic. Have 30 fighters not group into fighter groups, and give them all shield hit. that's a likely win.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-08-28 00:27:04)

Er...not as sure are you think. Yes, once they get within 10 (for lasers) to 15 squares (for proton torps), they would all reduce the sheilds by 5. That would completely deplete the SD's sheilds in one round of firing. With a +5 bonus to hit, they can never get an even or better chance to hitting, unless half do Aid Another Actions while the other half do Attack Run Actions.
But, on average, with a bit luck, those 30 X-wings shoul win the battle. There would be heavy causalities (I would say at least 5 every round, once they are within easy striking range of ion cannons and Point defense guns.
With a wide range of dice rolls...I dunno. The SD has 94 guns. Provided the fighters stay in range, you are talking about 5one shoot kills per round, while the SD is flying defensively. Sure the fighters could do the same, but the SD is already looking for a 20 on some of the guns. The end result of that fight out be 30 guns vs 94, and everyone waiting for a critical.

hmm, maybe if they grouped as fighter batteries (and had evasion). that would work a tiny bit better.
then again, I still can use my lvl 15 pilot and fight a star destroyer. depending on the fighter, maybe I'll win, maybe I won't

I would like to see this rolled out. Both scenarios. I too have seen the transition from D6 to non be rather lacking in what was great about the portrayal of space combat and what I would like to have seen.
Comparing tech is a moot point. They have shields, sure. Could the Bismark have protected itself against an X-Wing (Saga not D6 since sheilds are totally different) or perhaps even an unsheilded craft? Would the x-wing bother with a torp (it's suposed anti capital weapon) or just laser strafe and scupt its metal hull into something pretty before it sank. The point is that technology advances.
What I don't get is the idea of carpet bombing space. It's a rather big ... area. Flak dirtside makes sense, concussive air and shrapnel etc for anti aircraft. Can't target the individual, whatever, target the area around it (or what it's in: depth charges for another example) but autofire strafing space... well chalk it up to techno wizardry and move on I guess. (auto optics? but wouldn't that help target the individual within the area?)
I watched Macross zero again recently and really enjoyed all the combats but especially the fighter run on a destroyer with anti-ship missles. Very. Pretty.

I am willing to do this, but on a different thread. I started this with the idea of adjusting the current Star Wars space combat to be closer to WWII naval battles, and all this speculation of Starfighters vs Star Destoyer is, while fun, not my goal here.
> Comparing tech is a moot point.

Correct. As long as everything scales at the saqme rate, it doesn't really matter.
> What I don&#39;t get is the idea of carpet bombing space. It&#39;s a rather big &#8230; area. Flak dirtside makes sense, concussive air and shrapnel etc for anti aircraft.

Carpet bombing was mostly used against cities and such, destroying the infrastucture of the country you were fighting. Destroy the factories, and the enemy can't build tanks. Blow up the food stores, and the enemy can't feed it's troops. This, unfortunatley, was the way wars were fought up until recently.
Carpet bombing was also to make up for the lack of precise, pin-point targeting. The advance of technology has made it possible for a bomber to blow up *that* building, and not the others around it. Laser guide weapons, bombs guided by GPS, etc make destoying a single building easy. Back then, if you wanted to destroy a tank factory, you sent a flight of heavybombers that would blanket an area, and hope one of those 600 pound bombs landed on the target. This is easy now. But in the near future, I won't be surprised if their are devices that disable GPS, and thwart laser guidence systems. Then we will be back to dive bombing and carpet bombing.
> I watched Macross zero again recently and really enjoyed all the combats but especially the fighter run on a destroyer with anti-ship missles. Very. Pretty.

Ah, Macross. Love that show. And yes, we need to see more bombing runs.
Whoops,forgot a part:
> What I don&#39;t get is the idea of carpet bombing space. It&#39;s a rather big &#8230; area.

Everything scales. Got a large area to saturate with bombs or lasers? Some one will help you fill that area with their newset piece of people vaporizing machinery. Look, we went from fire arms that fired once every couple of minutes to those that can kick out hundreds of thousands of rounds a minute. Bombs went from fuse lit grenades to hydrogen bombs. Things get bigger.

I think that the exploration of that would help with the work you're trying to do here. See what plays out where and adjust accordingly. Just increasing the damage of antiship weapons I don't think would produce the desired result but I wouldn't really know that without seeing it actually rolled out for testing. If you wanted to run the simulation elsewhere that would just mean cross posting for a spell, no big deal.

This is what I said about, specifically, point defense and ATA (Fighter) combat. Laser weapons as flak doesn't translate for me. I wasn't talking about orbital bombardment.

you know, after being involved in a topic at the wizards forums, I've changed my mind, and I now agree with breederofpuppets.
There's 2 main problems with capital ships versus fighters
capital ships either spam proximity fire
or seperate all its' weapons
so those are the places that we should try to fix

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-30 15:13:29)

one thing, does proximity spread take the -20 penalty against smaller than colossal?
if so then swarming with fighters is quite a bit more possible.

I'm of the impression that the problem remains that in Saga fighters cannot threaten Capital ships in any meaningful way. I may be incorrect in this of course. The roll out already posted seems to suggest this.

---

### **Rebaav** (2008-09-08 14:12:01)

I recently joined a SWD6 game and so revisited the D6 materials I have and noted the stats for the Capital Ships of the line all the way down to the corvettes and true destroyer classes have little if any dedicated point defense/anti starfighter weapons. In most case none at all (STD, MC80, Correlian Corvette etc).
In D6 ships of the line were hurt or destroyed if some proportional volume of anti-capital ordinance struck them (A corvette could be destroyed by what would only modestly damage an STD) So there was a need for anti starfighter defenses and there were ships that did that. There were dedicated platforms such as the Lancer which was murder to starfighters but target practice to its peers (no anti-capital batteries at all). There were also pickets such as Neb-Bs or Carrack Cruisers or the monster called the Correllian Gunship (nothing sane wanted to mess with a squadron of those or even a solitary).
This seemed odd to me since I don't think I've seen any modern naval vessel of, any size, that didn't have *some* anti-air capacity but with the inclusion of the dedicated ships and since ships are always part of a grouping when deployed it didn't seem like that big of a problem.
My question is how the point defense of the STD, for example, compares to the Lancer or the Correllian Gunship?

Pretty much my thoughts on the subject. If fighters were a threat to capital ships, then you get more of WWII feel. Other things are needed as well, but that's a biggie.

WWII bomber and fighter/bomber planes made anti-aircraft weapons very important. Literally dozens of anti-aircraft guns were mounted on battle ships, destroyers, and just about anything else they could put between the enemy planes and allied aircraft carriers. These were 18 inch guns, but most like .50 machine guns.

An ISD, mark II, even without point D weapons, is a fighter killer, which makes no sense.

Yeah, saw a special last night on History about the Enterprise Yorktown class Carrier. Neat. I was refering to the D6 builds of the SW ships.

Yep.

Really!? I don't have access to the stats but from D6 both had only anti capital batteries. The ISD I had batteries with crazy amount of fire control assistance so they could be organized and coordiated to anti-fighter barrages with rather devastating results (the're anti capital guns! FC4D DP5D). The ISDII had guns built in entirely the opposite direction. It farts in the general direction of a MC80 and it splits in half, but good luck hitting agile fighters with those guns (FC0D DP10D).
So, in Saga the ISDII is now better at ant-fighter than even the dedicated anti-fighter platforms?
... now that fighters are of little if any of a concern to capital ships?
I'm trying very hard to find a metaphorical reference for this level of total lack of intelligence or understanding of basic rudimentary... argh. <!-- s:? -->![:?](https://i.ibb.co/KcdH3QwT/icon-e-confused.gif)<!-- s:? --> words fail...

Ah. While I have access to the d6 stuff, I haven't looked deeply at the space combat stuff. I am playing a giant snake solves-problems-on-a-personal-level-with-a-blaster-rifle kinda guy in the d6 game I am in.
> I posted it this way intentionally : , it&#39;s how it&#39;s coded from D6. Having some intentional fun here ;-)

There will be *no* having fun here! This is Star Wars, not some poorly researched science fiction space opera built strictly for your amusement!
> So, in Saga the ISDII is now better at ant-fighter than even the dedicated anti-fighter platforms?

It's mostly (partly?) due to the way the dice work. For example, in d20 based games, a 20 always hits. So, you always have a 5% chance of hitting something, even with tremendous penalties. In the d6 system, you have an open ended difficulties (heroic difficulties start at 30) and a dice pool that can increase dramatically. Plus, the wild die.
But no, a dedicated anti-fighter platform would preform better in shredding fighters than a ISD. But an ISD preforms very well in all the roles any capital ship can/should do. Meaning they have few if any weaknesses.
> &#8230; now that fighters are of little if any of a concern to capital ships?

Pretty much. Like **SacredPhoenix** showed with his squadron of starship maneuver having X-Wings, they can be a threat. Every ship pilot having the same maneuver is asking a lot, I think, but not completely implausible. Individually, however...no, an single fighter would hardly have any chance in damaging a capital ship, at all, under normal circumstances.
Part of it comes from the treatment of the proton torpedo. In d6, it was treated as an anti-big ship weapon, if I recall correctly. In the d20 (and all the stupid novels, as well), it was suddenly a fighter to fighter weapon.
Here is a thought: perhaps if we put together what should threaten a capital ship- so flights of these fighters, so many flights of those fighters, etc- and do some comparing that way, and see what the numbers look like. Maybe not an ISD, as they are the absolute best capital ship out there. Maybe more than one test, against several ships, including a ISD, so we get a better feel of how grand scale space combat works.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-09 13:19:32)

Here is another set of ideas:
Fighter weapons: We have, in general, blaster/laser cannons, concussion missiles, proton torpedoes, and a few assorted weapons (ion cannons, mines, etc).
In WWII, the break down was machine guns for anti-fighter combat (.50s were popular), big bombs for ships and buildings, smaller bombs and rockets for vehicles and small buildings/ship, and assorted other stuff.
Capital ships: In Star Wars, Capital ships often have turbolasers (other capital ships and planet side bombardment), point defense weapons (anti-fighter and other close in work), and assorted fun stuff (ion cannons, tractor beams).
In WWII, we had the big, big guns (for other ships and shore side bombardment), anti-aircraft guns out the kazoo, depth charges, and torpedoes, plus assorted goodies.
Here is what I am talking about the ISD does not treat the turbo lasers as 12 inch guns. No reload time, the can track moving targets, they don't do splash damage, etc. In the movies, they never acted like battle ships, either. So...my conclusion is that the turbolaser isn't the answer to the big guns on a battle ship.
There aren't any anti-capital ship missiles/bombs on a fighter. Unless we change how torpedeos and/or missiles work.
Anti-fighter weapons are...weak at best. Can they even be properly represneted in Saga? I picture a fighter weaving between incoming fire, dodging back and forth as he dives toward the big ship, until, at the last moment, he lets loose his payload, yanking at the stick, and pulls away in a fire dodging spiral as his munitions explode behind him. A system where you have static defenses, where your piloting skill does not reflect you ability to dodge fire, doesn't really show the above. Sure, you could get Vehicluar combat, but that's only good against one shot a round. Other than that, it's either the ship size, it's armor, and the characters very static defense score that matters. Very...blah.
But...what if we added/altered the weapons? Maybe that would have the lesser impact on the game, and still get where we wanna go? Maybe add a few options to the ship construction (anti-fighter arrays, some u-boat like ships, anti-ship torpedoes, some really big freakin' guns for capial ships, etc)?

AW!

The probabilities in the mid ranges are great. Higher dice become unmanagable in the RAW unfortunately.

You mean in Saga right? Things have changed in the different game systems that have serviced the Star Wars universe.

If it's a matter of survival of the fittest, pilots with that ... skill... would be the ones around but it seems more like there's something missing in the game system.

Wow. You recall correctly. I've played X-Wing+expansions and TIE fighter+expansions but not X-Wing vs TIE. There was just no way you were going to hit a fighter with torps. Once Rockets came in even the advanced torps were a waste of space. No Torps are very much anti-capital.
In D6, looking strictly at the average of the roll totals, a difference of 5D is a one shot kill. A 7D (the typical damage of a concussion missle which was portrayed as anti fighter) will typically smoke a TIE (2D hull) a 9D (torp) will slag an X-Wing (4D hull) should some poor X-Wing pilot happen to find himself needing to fly in the path of a torp to save a capital ship, 'cause it pretty much just wasn't going to happen outside of heroic efforts (Force points were NASTY!). X & Y Wings found themselves scrambling around picket ships and torps were NOT fired at the TIEs defending them!
> Here is a thought: perhaps if we put together what should threaten a capital ship- so flights of these fighters, so many flights of those fighters, etc- and do some comparing that way, and see what the numbers look like.

Sure! in D6 the capital buster fighter was the Scimitar Assault Gunship. 16 rack mounted missles (9D each) that could be deployed as a single salvo. Using the combined actions mechanic thats a single attack of 14D from a single fighter. ISD1s, should they ever get hit with that, would have only 13D to defend against that (7Dhull + 6D scale difference). The Supers would have 16D (10hull +6D scale difference). Good chance that ISD is getting damaged. Pretty much anything with Torps should be seen as a possible threat by a capital ship.
> Here is what I am talking about the ISD does not treat the turbo lasers as 12 inch guns.

So&#8230;my conclusion is that the turbolaser isn&#39;t the answer to the big guns on a battle ship.

Hrm right. I recall the howtizers on the Death Star not being able to track the Rebel fighters but I don't recall that being said for the weapons on the ISD1. There were restrictive fire rates in D6 but it really came down to skill in most cases. That made sense in D6 since the Fire Control on the ISD1s batteries often doubled the dice of the gunners!! (+4D Fire Control 5D damage) The guns on the ISD2, however, no. 50 gun emplacements with no fire control assistance and another 50 with minimal (0D 10D & 1D 7D). Monsters they were!
> There aren&#39;t any anti-capital ship missiles/bombs on a fighter. Unless we change how torpedeos and/or missiles work.

They did. It was changed. Let's change it back?

Maybe add a few options to the ship construction (anti-fighter arrays, some u-boat like ships, anti-ship torpedoes, some really big freakin&#39; guns for capial ships, etc)?

Based on the paragraph before it seems like something we need to address 1st is how (please do correct me if I'm misinterpretting) a level 1 pilot using a fighter vs a level 10 pilot in the same figher has the same DN to hit it? The fighters defense stats are not altered to reflect the different in pilot ability? That's awful! Once that's dealt with then we'd have a better idea of what the counter would need to look like.
The Lancer in D6 was a dedicated anti fighter platform with guns that were FC4D DP4D starfighter scale. They were accurate and they did ok damage. Usually they'd coordinate and then individual targets would just start getting picked off. A few of these would make short work of a group of fighters if the fighters didn't have means of dealing with them. In D6 that was fine but Saga... There were little in the way of Flak, though they did exist as proximity detonated cluster munitions.
The Space Galley in the Imperial Sourcebook was just mean spirited. A missle launcher/gun that had 5D fire control and 5D damage potential. So it's an anti capital weapon because of its size/scale but with FC like that it would be turned on fighters with a decent expecation of hitting for an anti capital missle! I mean gross.

### **Rebaav** (2008-09-09 15:12:59)

I recalled that years upon years ago I ran someone through a demonstration using average pilot stats vs Imperial pilots (yeah that was mean). 4 TIEs vs 1xwing & 1 ywing longprobe (no turret). IIRC the xwing took heavy damage and lost use of its lasers and the ywing was stripped of various systems and taken engine damage. Down to the last TIE that was circling the damaged ywing the xwing was taken to almost point blank and a single shot was taken with a torp, the only working weapon left. I wanted to say Yatzee. It hit! (The TIE piloting total was a little on the low side) I remember the damage total, without wild die assistance, to this day.
42
Try defending against that with 2 six sided dice. The TIE was less than vapor. I want to say that the TIE rolled a 1 on it's wild die but I think that's just me being mean. Very mean.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-10 23:55:27)

Instead of working, I got to thinking about Star Wars, WWII, and space combat.  Here are my thoughts:
It made sense that combatants were optimized to fight combatants of equal size (fighters and bomber throw a monkey wrench into this one, but we'll get to that).  So, size first.  I broke it down much like **DarthAnthrax** did: Fighters, Small Ships (small transports like the *Millennium Falcon*), Big Ships (Capital Ships) and Space Stations.  For the most part, I'll talk about the first four, because I think Space Stations are closer to plot devices and locations, not combatants.  For simplicity, they are sized by number:
Size    
1      Fighters
2      Small Ships
3      Big Ships
4      Space Stations/Buildings
Each size (generally) excels at taking out ships of it's own size.  Big Ships (battleships) hammer hard on other big ships, and fighter duels are well publicized.  So, the usual weapon system should match the size.  Again, I broke weapons down into groups: machine guns (anti-fighter weapons, mimicking the .50 machine gun), missiles/auto-cannons (bigger guns like 20mm revolver cannons, and rockets/missiles), artillery (12-inch main guns of battleships) and super weapons (equivalent to the Schwerer Gustav, an 800 mm cannon that fired 7 ton shells).  Again, the biggest are used as plot devices and not really meant for gameplay.  Also again, they were numbered:
Size
1      Light (machine guns & laser cannons)
2      Medium (auto-cannons/missiles & quad-laser cannons/torpedoes)
3      Heavy (12 inch guns & turbolasers)
4      Super Heavy (Schwerer Gustav and Death Star Lasers)
Neat how all the number match, huh?
As a default, each size craft would carry its sized weaponry.  It bears to reason that each ship can, with some difficulty, by equipped with the next size higher weapon; Fighter can be equipped with a quad laser cannon, and a Star Destroyer can have something like the Death Star Laser.  However, these ships are purpose built to carry said weapons, and far from the norm.  
Also, bigger ships can, and often do, have smaller weapons built on to them.  Battle ships were littered with machine guns to fend off fighters and dive bombers, and capital ships need Point Defense weapons to deal with fighters.
Weapon size would usually have a direct relation to rate of fire.  Fighter weapons fire very fast, soaking an area with main rounds, while capital ship guns take a bit to reload/recharge.
Expendable Weapons
In Star Wars, you don't really track ammo, and it no fun to pull out of a dog fight because you ran out of your 9 yards.  So, most weapons have unlimited ammo, or at least effectively unlimited (in case of railguns, where the usual ammo pellet could be weigh in single digit milligrams).  Weapons with limited ammo have to deal a bunch more damage to be cost effective.  Missiles, rockets and bombs deal significantly more damage than the size of the vehicle that carries them normally deals  This is common sense, and yawl know this already.
Expendable Weapons are broke down into two groups: guided and unguided. [hide]Let's face it, everyone ,loves sidewinder missiles.  Can't be helped, they are just so cool looking.  And having a pilot dip, duck, and weave while trying to evade a missile makes an awesome, if short, chase scene.  So let's keep guide missiles.[/hide]  Guided projectiles should usually deal damage equal to one size larger vessel: fighters shoot missiles that deal Small Ship damage, and Torpedo Boats (Small Ships.  Think of the Star Wars version of submarines) would hunt Capital ships.
All of this added together, and I propose that we use this- or a similar model- to construct our ships, their weapons, and space combat as a whole.  We have room for purpose built craft like Torpedo Boats, fighter-bombers, anti-fighter capital ships, and so on, an can keep with the normal, well loved ships like superiority fighters, gun tugs, and battle cruisers.
What do yawl think?

Which is why Renderlin, my (lousy) bounty hunter had a Strength of 4D with 2D of armor (and a mess load of scars). He will soon have a cyborg body made granting him a Strength of around 8D, plus 2D of armor. Mobile weapons/wall!

My feeling is that if this is the direction you want to take this, it needs to be reworked. The Correlian Corvette is 120m (iirc). The MC80 is 1200m. This does NOT mean its 10x the size it means it's 10x the length. This means, for volume and tonnage, it is significantly bigger than 10x. It's probably closer to 100x the size. To classify them as the same naval classification, let alone the same as a Super class with a length of 8000m, seems to me to be starting out creating a problem.

I think there is naval calssifications we can reference for this. Destroyers, Corvettes, Carriers, BattleCruisers etc. *Glances in the general direction of Google.*

This may be a place to start.
> Weapon size would usually have a direct relation to rate of fire. Fighter weapons fire very fast, soaking an area with main rounds, while capital ship guns take a bit to reload/recharge.

For this it would be more related to the size of what the weapon is mounted on. Bore size related to size of the mount. I see a weapon mounted on one ship of ship being able to shoot faster on another ship that is much larger. The weapon iteself would have more available to it, ammo feeds, recoil & other considerations, fire control etc. There would just me more available. The Zero is a good example of this. It had heavery guns with a slower rate of fire but those same guns fire faster when mounted on a Naval ship.
The tendency to mount weapons above the scale of the vessel has to do with the era. Huge guns firing a volley of massive shells because of the nature of naval warfare. With undulating seas it was a spray and pray approach, even 1 hit would secure a victory. With guided munitions now seen in modern warfare this is far less common and some of the CrazyBoomCannons are now delgated to coastal bombard not ship to ship engagment.
> All of this added together, and I propose that we use this- or a similar model- to construct our ships, their weapons, and space combat as a whole. We have room for purpose built craft like Torpedo Boats, fighter-bombers, anti-fighter capital ships, and so on, an can keep with the normal, well loved ships like superiority fighters, gun tugs, and battle cruisers.

Agreed.

> My feeling is that if this is the direction you want to take this, it needs to be reworked. The Correlian Corvette is 120m (iirc). The MC80 is 1200m. This does NOT mean its 10x the size it means it&#39;s 10x the length. This means, for volume and tonnage, it is significantly bigger than 10x. It&#39;s probably closer to 100x the size. To classify them as the same naval classification, let alone the same as a Super class with a length of 8000m, seems to me to be starting out creating a problem. I&#39;d like to see this dealt with now rather then before this evolves too far. Even D6 didn&#39;t cover this quite so well so I&#39;d love to contribute in a systems evolution if I can and welcome the chance!

I was thinking in broad strokes. A fighter is to a transport as a transport is to a capital ship. Too many classifications, and things get too complicated. I'm not saying we can't or even shouldn't break the size down more, only that I was going for simple yet smooth.
> I think there is naval classifications we can reference for this. Destroyers, Corvettes, Carriers, BattleCruisers etc. *Glances in the general direction of Google.*

I thought about doing that, but when I looked into it, the more convoluted those classifications were. Where did the dreadnought start and the battle ship end? Cruisers and corvettes were so similar to destroyers (I think those are the ships I am thinking of) you could tell unless you looked at the name on top of the blueprints. Sometimes ship classes were put into a category that didn't belong. Trying to itemize Star Wars ships is more confusing.
And, after that, I discovered what each category of ship did changed over the years. The best example are battleships. World War I, they were the heavy hitters of the fleet, the main combatant, and all the other ships were there to support/protect it, including air craft carriers (what few were there merely looked for enemy fleets). World War II, a battle ship became a bodyguard to air craft carriers, with the occasional shore bombardment duty.

I agree with you. Adjustments to rates of fire and such would change depending on ship size.A space station's artillery weapons would have more crew and droids, plus bigger generators, better targeting computers, and a very stable platform. They would be capable of using a capital ship weapon faster, with perhaps more damage, than a capital ship would.

I like CrazyBoomCannons.
Star Wars is a strange mix of modern and anceint, when it comes to weapons. Swords and laser guns. So we have to find the right mix. More on that when I get back from work.

I agree & I'm sorry I forgot a part to my post. I suggest we create our own classification based on size (displacement) for scale and another for task. The Scale would be used to hit it (120m vs 1200m lengths) and the second would decide it's use. A Correllian Gunship is the same scale as a Correllian Corvette but they are used for different tasks and so on. Just that. Destroyer, Frigate, Cruiser, Heavy Cruiser, Battleship, Dreadnaught may be the way to go. I think Saga has something like this worked in the defense ratings (Size). That whole armour part worked into a defense rating makes no sense to me. SciFi AC. Bah.
Keeping in mind that a Capital ship needs to meet the requirement in SW of having a massive powerplant. Some ships were classified as Capital just because of it's powerplant alone (Star Trek: Defiant). General guidelines start with length judgement calls would need to be made. The MC80 @ 1200m vs ISD @ 1600m is a good example. If you fold that long spearhead back onto the ship it ends up being almost the same size as the MC80 so same scale not the next one up.
Destroyer/Gunships could be anything up to 150m.
Frigate 150m - 300m
Cruiser 300m - 600m
Battleship/Heavy Cruiser 600m -1200m
Dreadnaught 1200m - 2400m
Super dreadnaught 2400m+
This scale system would also apply to weapons. A particular build of weapon built to one size would be one scale but similar build in a higher or lower scale/size would be a higher or lower scale. A torpedoe destroyer would be packing missles that can one-shot a vessel up to 2 scales higher and damage beyond that but that vessel could be of any scale as would the missles be 1 or 2 scales above that. A Battle Cruiser was a Cruiser built to threaten a Battleship with Battleships scale guns. The whole ISD1 vs ISD2 from D6 is probably a good example of upscaling weapons.

What about creating the size classes as above (Fighter, Small Ship, Big Ship, Station) and create universal levels in each? Like break them all into two or three groups (Light and Heavy, or Light, Medium and Heavy, respectively). This way you could have from 6 to 9 different "sizes" of ships, varied in minot things, but keeping the bigger things the same.
Or you could mix and match. Fighters coudl come in Light and Heavy, while everyone else has medium as well.
Like you said, real ships are classified by their purpose, and not their size. A dreadnought was a battleship with a nothing but big guns and a huge set of engines. Battle Cruisers were battleships that traded guns for speed, and Fast Battleships were just battleships that were really fast (well, fast for a 17,500 ton floating hunk of steel and cannons). And these are just kinds of battleships.
First, I think we should deal with size, and class them for purpose later. Most space craft will not be warships, even if they do have guns. Civilian verses military craft would vary in damage resistance, potency and number of armaments, shield strength, sensors (one might detect an asteroid, the other might detect stealth craft), and goodies (civilian has wet bars, massive cargo space, and fuzzy dice while military has inter-system communications, training decks, and hanger bays).

This seems more like purpose rather than scale.

For the purpose here coming up with a couple more sizes would help classify the ship sizes. 4 doesn't seem to provide enough to cover the wide range seen in SW.

I'm personally partial to the idea of using Naval Classifictions for starships.
Dreadnought: Larger than the Battleship, with bigger and more guns. Aka Super Star Destroyer.
Battleship: Huge, heavily armed and armored warships. Aka Star Destroyers.
Battlecruiser: Ships of similar size and armament to the Battleship, that trade off some armor for speed.
Frigate/Corvette: Small, light and fast warships used for patrol and merchant escort duties, or sector/planetary defense.
Carrier: Large warships, similarly sized to Battleships, used mainly for carrying large numbers of smaller short range craft.
Destroyer: Fast, maneuverable, long range vessel intended as an escort to larger warships.
Fast Attack: Small ships intended for system/planetary defense and "border patrol".

Back to the purpose versus size deal.
Perhaps...hm. We have to be careful on how big of a distinction we have between sizes. An A-wing and an X-wing are two very different ships yet only a few meters and tons different from each other. The Venator-class Star Destroyer and the Victory II-class are 300 meters different in size, yet were pretty similar.
Plus, we have to remember civilian ships of equal size. I don't was a billion ton grain hauler to be labeled as a "Dreadnought", for example. I'd rather keep the impressive sounding names to classes (re: purpose) of ships, instead of size.
How about this?
Swoop (ya know, swoops...)
Light Fighter (A-wing)
Heavy Fighter (X-wing, B-Wing)
Light Transport (YT-1300, VCX-820)
Heavy Transport (Recusant-class light destroyer)
Light Capital (Victory II-class Star Destroyer, Mediator-class battle cruiser)
Heavy Capital (Super Star Destroyers, Lucrehulk-class battleship)
Space Station (Death Star, etc)
Eight sizes, two of which aren't really useful. So six. Not enough, huh?

Ok.

This seems more a question of build/purpose rather than scale. I think that keeping fighters the same scale would simplify things a great deal anyway.
> The Venator-class Star Destroyer and the Victory II-class are 300 meters different in size, yet were pretty similar.

Wow really? That seems more like one is built better than the other. Significantly it would seem.

If the ship is the scale it is then it just is. To say that they are built the same would be a serious stretch. This gets back to the separation of scale vs purpose/build.

**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Random jumble of Thoughts</span>**
Starships of the Galaxy, the old d20 book, had nine sizes (3 fighter, 2 transport, and 4 capital) sizes. This was loosely based on the old D&D size groups of Fine, Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal, which was a bit weak. Still, it might work for us. Saga lists sizes based on the same kind of scale, but starts off at Huge, and adds three more sizes [Colossal (frigate), Colossal (Cruiser), and Colossal (station)]. Six vs nine, there. Something to wonder about.
I want to stress the need for more than one size category for fighters. After all, most players who want to pilot will be in starfighters.
**Purpose**
I was starting to list all the types Wookipedia had for ships, in hopes of giving us something new to work with, but stopped after it got annoying. I was hoping for something spelled out, nice and crystal clear, on what was what, but didn't find any. Cruisers, for example, are not called capital ships in the general description, but most if not all individual cruisers are capital ships. Carriers is another type, with some being capital ships, and some not. Frigate were also capital ships (usually, anyhow).
The easist/smallest designation for type I found was [here](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category"), and it has a lot to be desired. But, for the sake of doing something, here is the list:
[hide]Capital ship
Liner
Cargo container
Corvette
Cruiser
Dropship
Escape pod
Freighter classes
Frigate
Scout starship
Shuttle
Starfighter
Transport
Yacht[/hide]
Oddly enough, in the luxury liner entry, it says "The 100-meter minimum size for luxury liners is also the minimum size for all capital ships".
**New Republic Standard**
Michael P. Kube-McDowell, the author of The Black Fleet Crisis, listed the New Republic standard for their fleet I cut and pasted it here:
TYPE................... ROLE..............KEEL.......EXAMPLES
Agave-class............Picket.............190m......Kauri, Pran, Nagwa
Warrior-class..........Gunship...........190m......Marauder
Sacheen-class.........Light escort .....375m......Trenchant, Kettemoor, Stendaff
Hajen-class............Fleet tender......375m.......Ahazi
Majestic-class.........Heavy Cruiser....700m.......Resolve, Gallant, Illustrious, Indomitable, Liberty, Phalanx, Stalwart, Vigilant
Defender-class........Assault carrier....700m.......Repulse, Shield
Nebula-class...........Star destroyer.....1040m.....Brilliant
Endurance-class.......Fleet carrier.......1040m.....Endurance, Intrepid, Venture
And that's only for ships 190 meters long and longer. Smaller ships...oh boy.
**Purpose vs Size**
Wookiepeedia also separates between Role and Class (Role being what they are suppose to be doing, and Class having something to do with size and armament). Maybe we need to think on that?
Last thing, because my brain is hurting: purpose. Military craft tend to have less space available for cargo because they have hanger, much heavier armor, massive amounts of weapons, a whole slew of communications and sensor gear, and all that fun stuff. We could have a quality, like Military or Civilian, be required to assign to a craft, dicating the strength of the hull, etc. This way, there would be a definite difference between the Corellian bulk frieghter turned warship and the Star Destroyer.
...that sounded liek a good idea when I started. Now, not so much.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-22 00:23:37)

Another question: is the d20/Saga system right for this kind of project? At first, I would say no. d20 has always been a system where attack rolls and damage rolls are separate. Where, other than critical, how good the hit was matters none-at-all to the damage. Plus it is a class & level based system, where the higher level you you are, the better you are at combat (a 20th level wizard is a better fighter than a 5th level fighter). Attacking has never been considered a skill, but a class feature.
Maybe I should specify what I am looking for:
Skill based combat. Just because you're a 15th level soldier doesn't make you great pilot and/or gunner in a starship. Or, because your grandfather was a pilot, and your father was a pilot, you became a pilot, spending all your time trying to be like dear ol' papa and grand papa you missed out on some other things. But man, you sure can pilot!
*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">I dunno, I can&#39;t really see Saga not being a class based system, so that may not be the answer. But what about replacing your defense with your skill? Or making your attack bonus equal to your gunner skill? Adjustments must be made to Skill Focus and all that, but this might be worth pursuing&#8230;</span>*
Good attack rolls equal more damage. Not just the random 5% chance of a critical hit everyone gets, but something like "score over +5 on a hit, and you deal and extra 2 die damage".
Fighters, equipped with the right 'bombs' can hurt capital ships.
Stealth rules to make 'submarines' viable and deadly.
Missiles that function as tiny ramming starships. Those were more fun.
Definite shield rules. Can a shield stop physical objects? Can a shield stop ion damage? How far out does the shield extend from the ship? Etc, etc.
*A freaking classification system for ships that makes sense!*
That is all for now...

### **Rebaav** (2008-09-22 08:41:19)

I completely agree with all counts re a skill based system. The problem is that there is such a staggering amount of mechanics based around a system entirely apart from skills that you'd be left with reworking more than half the game book just to make it skill based. This convoluted system of Feats and Saves and etc just adds levels of extraneous complexity. I feel that a character being skilled at somethings represented one way in the system then skilled in something else being calculated through some totally different system that, *eventually*, does the same thing is wasteful.
Yet another reason I enjoy the SWD6 system. I do not enjoy the d6s themselves just the system they are housed in. House ruling the 5D base is needed badly (I roll *how many* if I spend a Force point!? : ). If we apply a few house rules adding the gameplay bits that the further evolved Saga system has that would be all that is needed to get what you are looking for though I'd want to rework SWD6 for going out of control & reason with the d6s (Really, it does get ridiculous fast!).
I really think that having a varied scale system with fighters is going too far with complexity. Looking at WWII, looking to modern fighters, looking at fighters as portrayed in SW they do have different scales, I agree completely. Creating a scale system for fighters introduces the Scale for Purpose angle that I think you were trying to avoid for the sake of simplicity and sanity. Keep in mind though please that I am agreeing with you.
Light Medium Heavy for fighters could be expressed by scale for purpose though purpose would keep Fighters as a single scale. That simplifies things a great deal. Just a thought.
