# Signature Item

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-06 17:25:46)

I was reading through this talent, since it seems like something I could use for a new character IÂ´m making, but it strikes me as being very odd.
You gain a +2 morale bonus on opposed checks. Okay, but do I gain it only on checks where I actually uses the item in question? In that case, it seems very limited. I can think of a few places where it could be useful, such as
[ul]
[*]Using Electrobinoculars or other sensory devices to find Stealth-using characters.  
[*]Dogfights  
[/ul]
However, if it works on **all** opposed checks, then I can easily make up a lot of examples where it seems very odd indeed that you should gain a bonus just from having an item, such as:
[ul]
[*]Perception/Stealth  
[*]The Outmaneuver talent  
[*]Dogfights (except if the object is the ship of course)  
[*]Use Computer to Issue Routine Commands  
[/ul]
So, am I getting this wrong, or is the talent quite limited in applications?

No thoughts?

I would say that the bonus applies any time the signature item is used as equipment in an opposed check. Period.
