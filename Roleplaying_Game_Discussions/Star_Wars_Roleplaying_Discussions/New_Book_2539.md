# New Book

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-10 16:13:58)

Starships of the Galaxy coming out in December. The cover looks pretty neat. Hopefully it will be worth the wait!

### **simplyscribed** (2007-11-10 23:17:27)

I'm pretty excited by what's already been revealed (in Gamer Radio Zero interviews and such).
And it'll be nice, when I have to come up with the latest NPC's transport on the fly, not to have the only things that I have stats on hand for be the YT-1300 and Firespray-31.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-11-10 23:55:13)

I just want rules that are the same across the board, something I create my own ship off of. I really don't like the Hero Trait* of what is currently available, nor things work this way on this ship, and that ship, and that ship over there, but not this one here.
The best game I ran for Star Wars was a Starfighter campaign, where the heroes were mercenaries in home-brew star fighters. They upgraded them all themselves, repaired them, gave them names, personalities, everything. One even role-played out finding the prefect droid for his ship. This book ought to help me achieve that again. I hope.
*Hero Trait *is the un-spoken trait of the space craft in Star Wars. Basically, if the ship was designed to be flown by the bad guys, it has no shields, weak weapons, and lousy handling. If ti was designed to be flown by the PC's, it had massive shields, strong weapons, proton torpedoes, and hyper-dirve built in, no matter how small the ship was.*

Really looking forward to this book also, I hope that personalization and customization are a big part of the book. I am praying that there will be more on vehicle combat as well.
Off topic: Anyone know when the galaxy tiles are coming? Does anyone have any screen shot by chance.. or links, please share.

Jan 15 is the release date. Haven't seen any pics though on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Galaxy-Tiles-Supplement/dp/0786947446/ref=pd_bbs_5/002-5891778-6208013?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194884513&sr=8-5 "http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Galaxy-Tiles-Supplement/dp/0786947446/ref=pd_bbs_5/002-5891778-6208013?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194884513&sr=8-5") they have the cover displayed

### **Rowen** (2007-11-22 08:25:08)

Wow they pushed the release date back? Not surprising with Wizards lol. Ill be glad to get this as well, just having the YT 1300 as a transport ship really cuts back on the creativity.

It's a great thread.
However, there is not consistency between one "conversion" and another. Just in the weapon department, you get twelve kinds of turbo lasers, and their range and damage codes don't make sense. Light turbo-lasers dealing more damage than heavy turbo-lasers, etc. I want one standard to play with, and then make exceptions when warranted (unique ships, spacial high end systems, etc.).
This is my only complaint about said thread.

I like that preview! Thanks for pointing us in the direction to it. I like the idea of being able to create or modify a starship. That could really come in handy. Not to mention making space travel a more prominent feature in some campaigns. Would add a whole different element to most peoples campaigns.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-16 23:10:47)

I saw a copy in the local BAM yesterday (thought it wasn't out on retail until the 18th?). I was incredibly tempted to get it, but I'm half-broke right now, so I couldn't. It did seem a bit thin for $35 dollars, though, so I hope I can find a better price on eBay in a few days.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-12-17 00:27:24)

Amazon told me it's on the way here. which is cool, cuz I got a long drive with my sister to do, and it will help the time I'm not behind the wheel

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 08:45:41)

Comes out Nov 18th, but I also see its at my local Border store. I'm going to go pick up a copy today <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 16:10:59)

I had it on Friday, and it's pretty sweet, actually. Lots of nice stuff in there. Some cool ships, an easy to use (once you understand it) customization system that actually helps to prevent people with lotsa credits from front-loading thier ships with all the best systems they can cram into it, and some new combat rules, talents and feats for those who want to be real good with starships. Most of the starships are actually illustrated (in full color!) with original artwork, instead of screenshots, and some even have deckplans.
My only complaint is that the book is a little light for the price, but overall, money well spent.

All good to hear. I'm afraid that that complaint is going to be consistent throughout this new Star Wars line. They're cutting costs wherever they can to try and ensure some profitability this time around.,

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-18 07:52:59)

Yeah, I figured as much. The rules light approach almost looks as though they're trying to lean toward the idea of using the miniatures in support of the RPG as well. It seems almost as though they're trying to force th issue.

---

### **Rowen** (2007-12-18 23:18:08)

I think its always about the money, its a business after all. As long as there are plenty of ships to keep me happy thats all I'm worried about. Next to the alien anthology (or what ever it will be called this go round), its one of the most wanted books for me. I have to travel out of town in the morning so i hope to pick it up. I really like hearing that they actually created artwork for the book this go round however.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-19 07:25:54)

I think some of the are is recycled from other sources, and some of it consists of screenshots from the movie, but a good portion of it appears original. To me, this at least goes part of the way toward making up for the page count to price ratio. The high quality of the art and writing do the rest.
Something I found funny though: Because of the way the Starship Modification System works, a Corellian Action IV transport could potentially mount more weapons than Super Star Destroyer. If you sacrifice all your cargo space, you wind up with 1800 extra Emplacement Points to mount weapons and such. Since it's Colossal (Frigate) sized, you can mount Turbolasers, Gravity Well Projectors and Heavy Concussion Missiles.
By giving up a measely 30000 tons of your total 90000 ton Cargo Capacity, you can build a space transport capable of going toe to toe with an Imperial I or II Star Destroyer.... (You'll have 605 extra EP's to mount weapons, shields, etc....)

Just imagine what you could do if you sacrificed all the Super Star Destroyer's cargo space....

Well I went to get it. Finally found the book and flipped threw it. I ended up putting it back on the shelf and will wait. 34.98 is a bit much for such a small book. I don't need it that badly. So for now Ill just hold out. Was a bit disappointed to tell you the truth.

Umm.... not much actually. You'd get a grand total of 50 extra Emplacement Points. Still significant, and enough to give the SSD a pretty big boost to it's weapons and/or fighter complement, but not as significant as for the Action VI.
It's like this: Each ship has to sacrifice a number of tons of cargo based on its size to get extra emplacement points. The Action VI has 90000 tons of cargo and has to sacrifice 50 tons to get an Emplacment Point. The SSD has 250000 tons of cargo, and has to sacrifice 5000 of them to get an extra EP.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-19 21:56:14)

Man, just hearing about these Emplacement Points makes me very excited about these new rules.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-20 05:34:36)

I'm going to wait after Christmas, I'm bound to get a Gift Card somewhere. $35 is a lot for a book. I know it's Lucas Arts, and its hard cover, so I'm grateful for that, but I can wait.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-20 07:08:29)

> Man, just hearing about these Emplacement Points makes me very excited about these new rules.

It is a cool system, and it accounts for certain things (like the ease of modifying Corellian Engineering Corporation starships) quite well by just giving them additional extra unspent emplacement points. It does however lead to a situation where players with a lot of credits laying around, or resourceful olayers, can seriously abuse the system to get a game breaking ship.
In my above noted example, you could sacrifice only 10000 tons of cargo, in exchange for the ability to mount 50 Point Defense Light Double Turbolasers. Or 20 Mediums. Or 10 Heavies. That is almost as much firepower as a Star Destroyer. Sacrifice all your cargo capacity to install 180 Heavy Turbolasers. Overall the system works, but it can lead to certain game wrecking situations.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-20 17:57:05)

Last night, in the chat, we were talking about the Ebon Hawk, and it was mentioned that it has no shields. Maybe it fits, game-wise, but this just seems off, canonically. What say you all?

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-20 18:16:05)

Ebon Hawk had shields in the game I think. The stock model that it comes from has a bunch of unused EP's, so you could mount a small (SR25) shield generator for only one so, I would say that it wouldn't be unreasonable to do so.

### **Anazider** (2007-12-23 18:53:07)

As thin as this book may be, I love it. Can't wait to make use of its various features.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2007-12-24 19:24:43)

Got my copy today (lovely early Christmas present) and the size of the book doesn't bother me. All of the content is useful and good quality, and I'll be making extensive use of it. I wish there had been room for some more deck plans, but otherwise I'm very happy with the purchase.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-12-31 00:26:02)

Alright, I got it, and I am annoyed (yeah, yeah, go figure).
All the customization is pretty niffty, the talents and feats are nice, and the example ships are pretty good. But where is my 'build a starship from scratch guide' like the last Starships of the galaxy had? I don't need a guide on how to tweak a ship, or how to limit what my players put in a stock model, I want a frame work to build me own ships. Basing new ships off already built ships only get so far, and I was hoping for more.
Like, I dunno, anything.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-31 00:51:41)

Look in the back of the customization guide. That gives you a rough idea of what a stock ship should be like, then you can modify the ship from there using the Customization Rules.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-12-31 01:44:25)

Still annoyed.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2007-12-31 02:47:26)

To elaborate on the above:
It gets really out of hand when adding certain parts to larger ships. Hyperdrive systems costing more I can see (a little. Hyperdrives are tough to install in starfighters, thus rank a higher cost. But installing a hyperdive in a Colossal [frigate] sized cost x10 the cost to shove on in a itty-bitty fighter craft?), and shields are a no-brain-er. But if I want to add a simple medium laser cannon to a capital ship, it's 500 times more expensive? That make no sense (I expect some mark up, but it's not like the cannon is throwing off the whole weight and balance issue, or requires that much more power than the ship already produces, and I seriously doubt the whole frame needs to be upgraded to handle the weight).
Emplacement Points: Good theory, and would normally work well...if you ignored the very bad difference between each size category. Okay,let's say I want to add the above laser cannon to a Corellian Action IV. You would have to give up 2 Emplacement points. Right. You're out of those, having spent them on that new fangled coffee maker. So you dump some cargo space for them, which equals out to 100 tons of cargo (not too bad. Weight of the cannon, plus generators, plus cable space, controls, and such). For a Star Destroyer to do that- keep in mind a Star Destroyer is a war ship, designed to handle weapons- it cost them a whopping 1,000 tons of cargo space, fo the same cannon. Why? The cannon doesn't shoot further, it doesn't do more damage, and the ray beam doesn't have a shanazy color.
Hyperdrives:
Aethersprite Interceptor, ARC-170, A-Wing, B-Wing, Chiss Clawcraft, Eta-2 Interceptor, E-Wing, Ginivex-class Starfighter, Lamba-class shuttle, Miy'til Fighter/bombers, Naboo Royal N-1, P-38 Starfighter, Predator-class starfighter, Scimitar assault bomber, Sith Infiltrator, Skipray blastboat, Sorosuub Patrol fighter, Starviper, TIE advance, TIE defender, V-19 Torrent Starfighter, V-WIng, X-83 Twintail, *ALL* X-wings, and the Y-wing all have hyperdrives.
Cloakshape Fighter, Coral Skipper, Droid Fighters (all of them, including the Mankvim-814 Light Interceptor), Geonosian Starfighter, Imperial Assault Shuttle, K-Wing, Sith Intercerptor, System Parol craft, every TIE not mentioned above, and the headhunter don't have hyperdirves.
out of 22 starfighters, only 9 don't have hyperdrives. Is this them showing how it's harder to put a hyperdrive starfighter? I sure as sugar don't think so.
There are a few more things, but I am tired. G'night all

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-01 07:49:48)

Couple of things:
First, from all appearances I have seen, the size of the ship does not affect the credit cost of weapons. Those systems that are affected by the size modifier have a cost that looks like "XXXX Credits Base." The weapons list has no items like that. The only cost multipliers are for adding weapon features, like Fire Links and Cannon Enhancements.
Secondly, I also noticed the issue with the emplacement points, including the fact that one could (very cheaply) build a fleet of rather potent warships out of Action IV Bulk Transports.... (By trading in all your cargo space you'd wind up with 1800 extra emplacement points....)
Several of the starfighters that you mention have *Attachable* hyperdrives. Notably the Aethersprite, the ETA 2, and possibly a few others. The Hyperdrives on these fighters aren't installed on the ship, but can be attached by way of a booster ring. A booster ring doesn't cost any EP, but you can't land your ship with it. It must be detached and left in orbit of the planet, which makes it vulnerable to thievery.
The ones that you do mention having hyperdrives are all larger fighters (Garguantual instead of Huge,) which means that they have a lot more space (they are about three times the size of Huge fighters in general) in which to cram stuff.
The Sith Infiltrator, Lambda Class, Skipray Blastboat, and Assault Shuttle don't even belong on that list, because they aren't fighters. Look at the stat blocks for these ships again: they are considered Colossal Transports.
The Assault Shuttle has no hyperdrive because it was intended for one very specific purpose: to land groups of troops and small vehicles on planets after deployment from capital ships. The are kinda like the Landing Transports used by the MArines on WWII.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-01-01 17:07:27)

First, I don't like some things about the book- it happens. Overall, I like the book (I don't think I like it for the price, but...meh). But it has issues, and I'm pointing a few out. This let's me complain, and allows others to note them for when it comes up with their games. At the very least, a story explaination can be prepared, if no rule adjustments are brought up.
I also read you emplacement point work up, and just took it further (or more detailed). Nothing more.
> First, from all appearances I have seen, the size of the ship does not affect the credit cost of weapons. Those systems that are affected by the size modifier have a cost that looks like &quot;XXXX Credits Base.&quot; The weapons list has no items like that. The only cost multipliers are for adding weapon features, like Fire Links and Cannon Enhancements.

I saw that, after I posted. But, I'll concede a "Good Point", nevertheless.
> Several of the starfighters that you mention have *Attachable* hyperdrives. Notably the Aethersprite, the ETA 2, and possibly a few others. The Hyperdrives on these fighters aren&#39;t installed on the ship, but can be attached by way of a booster ring. A booster ring doesn&#39;t cost any EP, but you can&#39;t land your ship with it. It must be detached and left in orbit of the planet, which makes it vulnerable to thievery.

Attachable hyperdrive sleds and such I have no issue with; I think that's a cool idea. And hyperdrive sled or rings are not considered 'non-standard', and therefore outside my complaint. However, I noted the problems with my list, and will fix it below.
> The ones that you do mention having hyperdrives are all larger fighters (Garguantual instead of Huge,) which means that they have a lot more space (they are about three times the size of Huge fighters in general) in which to cram stuff.

Here is the list again, this time added **color** to the Huge ones.
ARC-170, A-Wing, B-Wing, Chiss Clawcraft, E-Wing, Ginivex-class Starfighter, Miy'til Fighter/bombers, Miy'til Assault Bomber, Naboo Royal N-1, P-38 Starfighter, Predator-class starfighter, Scimitar assault bomber, Sorosuub Patrol fighter, Starviper, TIE advance, TIE defender, V-19 Torrent Starfighter, V-Wing, X-83 Twintail, ALL X-wings (3 of them), and the Y-wing.
That's now 23 hyperdrive (built in) capable starcraft, 7 of which are only Huge sized.
Aethersprite Interceptor, Cloakshape Fighter, Coral Skipper, Droid Fighters (all of them, including the Mankvim-814 Light Interceptor, so 3 of them as well), Eta-2 Interceptor, Geonosian Starfighter,, K-Wing, Sith Interceptor, TIE Fighter, TIE Bomber, TIE Interceptor, and the Headhunter don't have hyperdrives.
Now, that's 14 fighter craft that don't have a hyperdrive, 8 that are Huge sized.
You still have 2/3 "equipped with non-standard parts" fighter craft, with almost of third of them 'too small' to have hyperdrives. A 33% is way too common to be considered rare, or even unusual.
My complaint isn't "why do hyperdrives cost more on figther craft". Quite the contrary, I think more fighter craft should be without hyperdrives, with numerous reasons. I'm annoyed they added so many hyper-fighters to the book. I would have preferred a few Colossal sized transports, carrying a half dozen fighter craft to a ship the pilots are intended to sit in for a week at a time during hyperspace travel. That would work better with a mixed party than a fleet of PC piloted fighter craft.
All in all, though, not bad. I have to play with it more, but so far, not bad.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-01 17:50:50)

You need to keep in mind a couple things:
First, the fighters that don't have Hyperdrives were either designed to be short range fighters (Droid Fighters, Tie Variants) that are either based in one location or are carried aboard ships that have Hyperdrives. Or they are older fighters (Sith Interceptor, Cloakshape, Headhunter) and one could infer that they were designed at a time where it would be too costly or difficult to design and mount a hyperdrive.
Besides which, you can use a hyperdrive sled or a booster ring with any of them, as the rules do not specifically say you can't.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-01-01 21:52:22)

I really don't care what each individual starfighter was designed for, I'm looking at the majority. Old tech, new tech, in-system fighting, or out-of-system fighting, I'm annoyed with the fact most of the itty-bitty one-man craft have hyperspace drives and there is no sense behind it. Unless you go with 'Heroes have cool gizmos!' kind of logic.
For the record, I never said you could use a hyperdrive sled on any ship it wasn't designed for.
Are you arguing that fighters are suppose to hyperdrives as standard, or that TIE fighters are the norm?
If hyper fighters are the normal, that counters what's in Installation section of Chapter 3. Since it cost so much to outfit a single fighter with a hyperdrive- and no one has figured out how to chop the price down- it is hardly something that would be common.
If hyper fighters aren't the norm, it counters the ratios is listed in Chapter 4. In this case, where hyper drive equipped fighters are suppose to be rare, your standard starfighter should be found aboard a carrier, on a space station, or found on a planet.
The idea of a 'long range' fighter is pretty dumb, in my mind. Hyperspace travel is measured in *days*. Other than the odd Jedi (capable of hibernating during a hyperspace jump), you end up having the pilot stuffed in a closet sized space for one day to a week. And then expect him to pilot and fight without suffering any penalty. When compared to a carrier borne fighters, they get in their ships just before exiting hyperspace, fresh, rested, and good to go. The only thing you lose in the few moments it takes to launch those fighters. Sure you could have a squadron of hyper fighters to jump with you when your capital ship jumps, but other than that cannon fodder, a hyperspace capable fighter- or long range fighter- is not a good idea.
By appearances, so many fighter craft are hyperspace capable because "no hero would be *lashed* to a carrier. That's just not *cool*". Bunch of Mary Sue fighter jock's who don't want to depend on anyone, say me.

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-02 02:06:52)

I haven't purchased the book yet, but some points were brought up that confuse me. Firstly, the staggering amount of fighters with hyperdrives. If it's in the stat block it must be considered standard. Well in all the source material I've read hyperdrive systems are not standard on almost all fighters. The only reason they seem prevalent is because most media involve Jedi who can travel vast distances in such a confined space. Fighters are the equivalent of WW2 fighters in that they rested on carriers until battle when they launched. While most fighters can be fitted with a hyper drive it is by no means standard and very non-canon. Hopefully, I've misinterpreted the thread so far. Secondly, is the matter of size versus cost. To me it makes no sense to have a weapon or component that functions the same regardless of size cost more the larger it gets in either space or money. Credit-wise it always costs more to have a miniaturized version of anything. As long as a turbo laser does the same damage, range, etc. it should only cost more the smaller it gets. In terms of ship space, the only way a turbolaser (or anything else for that matter) would end up bigger on a bigger vehicle is if it did more damage, increased range, etc. Its ludicrous to assume that a turbolaser on the death star will take up more space than on a star destroyer. If it's the same turbolaser in every other way, it won't take up more space. And like I said, this applies to any component not just lasers. I really hope I'm incorrect in my interpretations because the mechanics seem flawed.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-01-02 02:55:38)

THe more I play with the book, they happier I am, actually. It's a good book. But it does have it's flaws (like every other game book. Nothing is prefect these days).
With the hyper drive thing, it's a setting thing, really. In all the comics, books, and even in the movies, the heroes flew hyper space capable fighter. Luke did it in the movies, so of course one's hero will also have one. The authors bow to the buyers, and the buyer want cool stuff for their heroes, and that means not having to hitch a ride on the local frigate to get to the next star system. hyperspace travel is glossed over, after all. Other than some character interaction, what's it good for?
The cost vs. size issue was actually me misreading something. For items that make sense to increase- such as shields, armor ratings, and computers- the cost increases with size. This makes sense; you need bigger and more shield generators to cover a Star Destroyer, you need more armor plating, etc. For individual items that don't depend on a space ship's size- idividual weapons, for example- the size doesn't affect the price.
Saga has a some what strange deal with it comes to weapons. Unlike D&D, you don't have weapons of different sizes. A Hutt with a blaster rifle deals the same damage as a jawa with one. The Hutt can carry a bigger weapon easier, however (so the Hutt can slither around with a E-Web repeating blaster mounted on his stomach and it's generator on it's back with the jawa is max'ed out with the afore mentioned blaster rifle).
This carries over in starships as well, using both a minimum size requirement and emplacement points. Bigger ships can fit bigger weapons on them (turbo-lasers, for example, are Colossal size or above only), and they have bookoo more emplacement points to spend on them. For example, a basic starfighter has 5 emplacement points, while a Frigate has 50. The starfighter also has no cargo space to dump for more points, while the frigate can blow any of it's 5,000 tons of space for more emplacement points (for 50 tons of space for each emplacement points, topping out at 100 more emplacement points).
The emplacement point cost is also set up to accommodate size sizes (this is a resent discovery, **They call me Bob**, bear with me). A quad laser cannon uses up 2 emplacement points. That's a nice weapon there, and gives you fighter a good punch even if it only leaves your fighter with 3 more points to spend on shields and such. But on your frigate, those two emplacement points get you sexy new light turbo-lasers, and you still have 48 points for more toys. Like more turbo-lasers. Or beefy shields. Or a tractor beam. Or a hanger bay (and you know how much chicks dig hanger bays).
So, put your worries aside. It's a good book, and the ship building/modifying section is alright. Just remember to be a GM, and step on folk intent on breaking they system.

> Are you arguing that fighters are suppose to hyperdrives as standard, or that TIE fighters are the norm?

No, but I would point out that most of the long range fighters fall into one of three catergories: Either they are fighters used by the Rebel Alliance during the original trilogy (A-Wing, B-Wing, X-Wing, Y-Wing) or else they are what I like to call "Expanded Universe Twinkage."
Now, Rebel starfighters having hyperdrives I can see primarily for the reason that the majority of the ships the rebels have are starfighters, and they have several models designed just for them. They are given superior systems to counter the numerical superiority of Imperial Tie's. The "Expanded Universe" stuff, I generally ignore it out of principle, so I don't even consider those ships worth looking at.
The third catergory is "Custom Built" fighters, which are generally one shot deals that are so expensive that the cost balances it out.
> If hyper fighters are the normal, that counters what&#39;s in Installation section of Chapter 3. Since it cost so much to outfit a single fighter with a hyperdrive- and no one has figured out how to chop the price down- it is hardly something that would be common.

I agree, but if you ignore the "EU Twinkage" there aren't really that many fighters that have hyperdrives.
Another factor to consider is that the developers of the game have basically stated that you aren't intended to be able to develop ships of the same power level as those in the book using the custom rules that are given, simply because many of the ships (in the EU particularly) are so powerful that to allow players to custom build equivalent ships would break the game.
Certain ships are also designated to have certain abilities simply because the source that they are drawn from says they have those abilities, but you could not build ships with those abilities because it might (again) break the game.
> If hyper fighters aren&#39;t the norm, it counters the ratios is listed in Chapter 4. In this case, where hyper drive equipped fighters are suppose to be rare, your standard starfighter should be found aboard a carrier, on a space station, or found on a planet.

In my games, the most commonly availible fighters for PC's to aquire are those that don't have hyperdrives.... Cloakshapes, Headhunters, etc. A used ship dealer might have a dozen of these lying around, but only one or two X-Wings. This also raises the price. My players pay more for hyperdrive capable fighters.
> The idea of a &#39;long range&#39; fighter is pretty dumb, in my mind. Hyperspace travel is measured in *days*. Other than the odd Jedi (capable of hibernating during a hyperspace jump), you end up having the pilot stuffed in a closet sized space for one day to a week. And then expect him to pilot and fight without suffering any penalty. When compared to a carrier borne fighters, they get in their ships just before exiting hyperspace, fresh, rested, and good to go. The only thing you lose in the few moments it takes to launch those fighters. Sure you could have a squadron of hyper fighters to jump with you when your capital ship jumps, but other than that cannon fodder, a hyperspace capable fighter- or long range fighter- is not a good idea.

The rationale behind many of the Rebel Alliance hyperdrive fighters is this: The fleet can make a jump to a location near a battle they are going to be fighting, then they can deploy thier fighters, and the entire fleet them makes a micro-jump to the location of the Imperial ships they are engaging. They drop out of a few-hour hyperspace jump ready to rock, with gives them a slight edge over the Imperials at the outset.... the Imperial fleet must deploy fighters. The minute or two that this gives them might allow them to achieve something.
It also serves as an emergency escape: If the battle goes poorly, the entire fleet can jump out to a pre-determined location, without pausing to retrieve fighters.
There is actually a precendent for "long-range" fighters in modern days: Fighters on patrol in "no-fly zones: etc. often spend 10-12 hours in the air before returning to base.
> By appearances, so many fighter craft are hyperspace capable because &quot;no hero would be *lashed* to a carrier. That&#39;s just not *cool*&quot;. Bunch of Mary Sue fighter jock&#39;s who don&#39;t want to depend on anyone, say me.

Another reason for it is to allow the players to be able to move around and go on missions *without* the extra resources granted to them by having a capital ship nearby. If they don't have emergency backup (or an emergency *deus ex machina….*) availible, it tends to make them more cautious, and cause them to play smarter. Hyperdrive equipped fighters mean that the players can go on missions farther away from thier base (and all the resources that go with it....)
> Secondly, is the matter of size versus cost. To me it makes no sense to have a weapon or component that functions the same regardless of size cost more the larger it gets in either space or money. Credit-wise it always costs more to have a miniaturized version of anything. As long as a turbo laser does the same damage, range, etc. it should only cost more the smaller it gets. In terms of ship space, the only way a turbolaser (or anything else for that matter) would end up bigger on a bigger vehicle is if it did more damage, increased range, etc. Its ludicrous to assume that a turbolaser on the death star will take up more space than on a star destroyer. If it&#39;s the same turbolaser in every other way, it won&#39;t take up more space

I believe I've already partially addressed this, but I'll address it again: Turbolasers (and any other weapon) do not cost more or less depending on the size of ship that you mount them on, unless you are trying to mount them on a ship that is too small for them, like a Starfighter. Nor do they take up any more or less "space," unless you are mounting them on a ship too small.
Most of those systems that do cost more make sense: Obviously, a Luxury Upgrade or a bunch of Maneuvering Thrusters is going to cost more on a larger ship, because there is a lot more space to be made luxurious, and the maneuvering thrusters need to cover a lot more mass and move a lot more bulk.
> So, put your worries aside. It&#39;s a good book, and the ship building/modifying section is alright. Just remember to be a GM, and step on folk intent on breaking they system.

I agree for the most part. My only issue with the modification system arises out of a problem that I noticed with the Cargo for Emplacement Points trade system, more specifically that Frigate sized Bulk Transports make out like bandits when trading in cargo space. 50 tons per EP seems like a lot when you've got 500 tons to work with, but much less so when you've got 90 000 tons to work with....
This is easily houseruled though, by simply saying that Bulk Transports can only trade in a percentage of thier cargo space....

### **Anazider** (2008-01-03 15:19:00)

One of the big issues I've come across with the SotG book is the use of hangar bay modification, which makes it almost impossible to make a viable carrier-style ship from scratch. There is also no house rule for the number of fighter craft that can launch from a vessel per turn. I've found an elegant house rule on the WotC boards that deals with both of these issues:
Hangar Bays
The initial cost for a Hangar bay is 8 Emplacement Points. This 8 Emplacement Points gives you the ability to hold (Cost Multiplier)/50 units of ships, and the ability to launch (Cost Multiplier)/10 units of Ships each round. A ship in the hangar bay takes up a number of units equal to its cost multiplier.
Each additional (Cost Multiplier)/50 units of ships held OR (Cost Multiplier)/10 units of ships launched per round costs 4 Emplacement points.
For a hangar that is only designed to hold one type of craft, such as TIEs, X-wings, etc. the total Emplacement Pont cost of the Hangar Bay is 1/2, while the cost in credits is double.
The initial base cost in credits is 500 credits. The base cost in credits for each additional (Cost Multiplier)/50 units of ships held OR (Cost Multiplier)/10 units of ships launched is 250 credits.

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-03 17:42:34)

It's possible with the larger ships, which is the realistic size for a carrier, it's a lot more possible. Bulk Tranports also make good carriers. Bulk Transports make good anything.... but I digress.
In real life, Aircraft Carriers are some of the largest ships on the seas, bar few. There are perhaps a few Supertankers, Battleships and Cargo Ships that are larger than an Aircraft Carrier, but in general, the Carrier is the largest.
Does it not make sense then that the largest cpital ships make the best carriers?

---

### **Anazider** (2008-01-03 18:30:43)

Oh, it most certainly makes sense but I wasn't speaking from a "realism" standpoint in the least bit. What I'm speaking of is game mechanics.
Lets take the Corellian Corvette, for instance. This ship is a Star Wars staple, and has several examples as serving as a "pocket carrier" for pirates, covert operations, etc. If we convert all of the CR90s cargo into EPs, that gives us 60 EPs plus the 5 from it being a CEC design, so 65 over all. Convert that into Hangar Bays, and you have 8 units worth of starfighters. That's either 8 huge starfighters or 1 Gargantuan, under the current rules.
By comparison the *Night Caller*, a modified CR-90 was written as being able to augment its cargo bays to carry the entire Rogue Squadron. The *Backstab*, another modified CR-90, apparently carried 5 squadrons of TIE Uglys, and was one of *27* such corvettes in the Invid pirate gang. With the RAW, this is impossible to create without GM Fiat. With the aforementioned house rule, its actually possible to create such starships, or modify Codex ships to be capable of such. Larger ships are still capable of carrying more starfighters and other craft, but this house rule makes it so that you don't have to go out and capture a Star Destroyer just so you can carry around a starfighter party of 6. <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->p

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-01-03 22:58:37)

In regards to hanger bays and such, I am already going to be modifying how I handle it. This is due to my old starfighter game, and how much fun it was.
In that game, to emphasize how rare and special X-wing level ships were- and the fact there were *many*, the players started in sub-par star craft (they had the good stuff by level five) that I made up. These fighters were sans hyper-drives, and in order to do deep space missions they rode aboard a hyperspace capable transport craft that had four hanger bays (in the old RCR rules, the carrier was one size larger than the *Falcon*, and could handle the weight).
Exactly how I'm gonna handle this...I dunno. But **Anazider**'s house rule looks like an excellent place to start.

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-22 00:43:41)

Hmm.. Might be a balancing issue. I had a Colossal (frigate) Space Transport at 20 DR before the book came out, guess I will have to drop it.
Unless I create a background for the ship, but it should cost some emplacement points.
Anyone have any ideas on how many emplacement points to grant +5 DR should cost. This is purely a special modification, so any ideas or thoughts would help.
Let's call it...
Ship Trait :Flawless Ship Chassis
Through the result of very rare circumstances, where the conditions of the ships engineers and master craftsmen took a special interest in making a near perfect build they crafted a superior chassis. The ships chassis is in perfect harmony and integrity granting more durability in resisting damage. Ships lucky enough to have this trait are just simply built better, because of the slow process of the build and the scrutinizing level of detail to perfection. Prototypes and ground up builds are the only way you can come across such a quality, any ship built in a production line ship yard doesn't take the time to perform the rigorous stress testing for each part used in building the chassis. If a ship that has the trait Flawless Ship Chassis ever becomes disabled through massive damage (not ion damage) triple all costs for repairing hull damage.

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-22 06:56:31)

I don't think that DR is one of those things you should be tweaking, except by the normal means provided by the book (I believe that the Advanced Ship template adds to DR....) simply because by allowing that to be tampered with you make the ship too hard to damage. I can see all sorts of game breaking exploits cropping up. Balancing your suggestion the way you have notwithstanding. I have played numerous games of Saga, and I have yet to have a ship be disabled on me because of damage.

Hey BreederofPuppets,
Make me a 2 in 1 ship. I want to have a Colossal (Frigate) Space Transport be able to haul cargo and when it gets hairy it can detach into a Colossal Space Transport leaving the cargo float in space. <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)
I was actually thinking this would be kinda cool for a plot in my story, but I don't think the current rules cover such a design.
I guess it could be two ships, one Colossal (Frigate) Space Transport and one Colossal Space Transport with some special clamp attachments.

Hm...I'll work at it, but here are some preliminary thoughts:
Colossal (frigate) transport ship that can drop it's attached cargo bay, and drop to Colossal size. The detaching part I'll call the '*Bulk*', and the much smaller part will be called the '*Engine*'. Speed of the Engine would increase (1 square?) due to dropping the Bulk, a massive amount of cargo space would be gone (10,000 tons to 5 tons?), you'd lose EP's (I'd take them from just the Bulk part, but it might be more appropriate to take it from both), any EP's spent on the Engine would have to be subtracted from the Colossal (frigate) as well. And...that's all for now. I gotta head to work.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-24 19:59:58)

I was thinking along the same lines, maybe even calling it a Super Cargo Pod and using the Cargo Pod detachable rules for escape pods.
I want the Colossal size (engine) space transport to be able to handle dogfights, so hopefully there will be some EP's left to buy Combat Thrusters.
On another note.
If a Colossal (Frigate) Space Transport, for examples sake, has a hangar bay that can hold 1 huge Vehicle but is not holding a vehicle.
How would you handle this for Cargo Space? I think an empty hangar bay can be used for storage, don't you?
Using Cargo Pod Rules you could have 4 heavy Cargo Pods, costing the same as 1 hangar bay. That would give you 2,000 tons of cargo space.
If you use a light or medium it would be less cargo space, but how would you decide?
Using straight Cargo Space conversion for EP's would give you 400 tons of cargo space [ ( 1 EP for size multiplier, x50 for Colossal (Frigate) and its 8 EP's for the hangar bay , I'm going with this one for right now since it isn't really a modification more of a conversion.
Any thoughts

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-01-25 01:53:19)

Check out my Svip'dag in the Star Ship and NPC forum. It's my thoughts on who one of this separating monsters should be made.
I managed to squeeze Combat thrusters in there, 80,000 tones of cargo, and a coffee maker. No, wait. Sorry, no coffee maker; I ran out of EP's. Plus, it's not an *uber* ship, which I think is a plus in this case. These are many reason it never showed up in the movies.
I forgot to post this in my ship notes, so I'll say it here:
It's got nothing but blaster cannons, and it's hyperdrives is less than stellar. I imagine this thing was built and designed before all of the movies, so any available after that just might have the junker template.

I would say straight EP for cargo space conversion at the same rate of conversion as the base ship. In this case, the ship is Colossal (Frigate) so 400 tons. I would also limit the types of cargo that could be carried in that space.

a massive amount of cargo space would be gone (10,000 tons to 5 tons?)
It occurs to me that no one in their right mind would want to drop that amount of cargo... For almost ANY reason. That's a prince's ransom of stuff right there.

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-25 22:37:46)

Actually, it makes a certain amount of sense. If the "base ship" has all the high tech bits like the hyperdrivve, and the smaller ship has perhaps some basic life support, cargo space and a slow hyperdrive and a "re-entry" system you can use such a ship as a massive "tractor trailer."
The ship goes to a star system, drops one load of cargo off in orbit which is either then unloaded, or enters the planetary atmosphere and drops to the planet. While this is going on, the ship can immediately pick up another load and jump to the next destination.
The trailer portion is then retrieved and unloaded at the leisure of the reciever, and re-used.

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-26 02:38:15)

@simplyscribed
Its supposed to be a cheap old way to move massive cargo loads and break off cargo quickly for fast transport. **The Call Me Bob** pretty much hit the nail on the coffin in his last post. Limited in weapons, It can take some hits, but moving all that cargo makes it slow. I suppose you can just put a Clamp to hold an exterior starship or two, but I was picturing a pusher ship or towing ship hauling large sectional cargo holds that can break away.
The smaller Colossal (space transport) would have most of the weaponry and if it had combat thrusters it could engage in dog fights to protect itself.
When I think of star ships in the universe, I use the thinking that not everyone builds ships the same. Not all ships are perfect, or the best. This type of ship is very vulerable, but can haul large loads of cargo. Its slow too, I expected the Hyperdrive to be x2 or worse. Its a budget haulers frigate, not everyone can afford those fast large frigate haulers. I was thinking of independent tramp frieghter captains that haul cargo for smaller businesses or planets.
That's kinda my thinking behind the concept-
**On another subject**
If I want to create a ship from scratch and use the Stock Values on page 53, Table 3-9, Can I use all converted EP's towards modifications?
Under **Emplacement Points** it says that points gained from worsening a stock ship's starting value in a category may be kept as spares or used to purchase additional cargo space, adding tons of cargo capacity equal to the starship's cost modifier for each emplacement point spent.
Can you worsen more than one category?
Can spares be used towards modifications? Was this the intention?
Does this mean that I can convert a stock Colossal (frigate) Heavy Frieghter's 100,000 tons by 50% into 2 or 3 EP's? Then use those EP's for Modifications?
If this is true, then why would you worsen the Cargo tonage for 2 or 3 EP when you can do a a straight conversion on pg.38 and gain 1,990 EP's and still have 500 tons of cargo space?
**Another Question:**
What is the Ships Int used for?
Does it add to the Mechanics and Use Computer Skills for the crew?
> Hangar Bays
> The initial cost for a Hangar bay is 8 Emplacement Points. This 8 Emplacement Points gives you the ability to hold (Cost Multiplier)/50 units of ships, and the ability to launch (Cost Multiplier)/10 units of Ships each round. A ship in the hangar bay takes up a number of units equal to its cost multiplier.

They definitely needed to elaborate on the Hangar Bays. Its going to take more work for GM's to balance this area. Under current rules a Colossal ship takes up 20 units of space, under your adopted example it only takes up 5 units of space. I think its a little low, but I see how the rule was trying to use existing tables. I was wondering can a Hangar Bay hold anything above Colossal size, it doesn't have rules for Colossal (frigate). Under your rule, its possible if you have enough unit space, which is cool, but maybe there should be a limit on size.
I am disappointed that they did not talk about Space Stations, like they hinted in the Web Enhancement.

### **Anazider** (2008-01-26 10:14:05)

Intelligence is added to the Attack Bonus of the crew when determining the attack bonus for each weapon. So lets say you have a Skilled pilot flying an X-wing. As per the crew table in the Core book, skilled crew have a +2 base attack bonus, an X-wing has 16 intelligence giving it a +3 modifier, for a +5 attack bonus. If the pilot has the vehicular combat feat, then this bonus moves to +7 for pilot-operated weapons. For mechanics, perception, and use computer checks you do not apply the ships intelligence. You use the crews base skill bonus, plus any special skill bonuses, like from a sensor enhancement package.
For hangars, I've used a different house rule which can be found in the GMs section of these boards.

Unique Starship Crews (Clarification)
**Skills:** Character's appropriate skill modifiers ( + vehicle size modifier + vehicle Dexterity modifier in the case of the Initiative and Pilot skill). If the ship's computer is friendly or helpful towards you, you also add the ship's Intelligence modifier as an equipment bonus to your Use Computer checks.
So, I guess you do add the Int bonus to Computer Use Checks, as long as your friendly to the ship, but do you put that in the stat block for the ship?

Thank you Anazider for suppling the links and being so helpful :

### **Anazider** (2008-01-27 10:35:57)

I don't see the Int bonus added to the Use Computer checks in any of the stat blocks.
With a skilled crew, or any of the crew listings in the core book, the attack bonus listed is treated as the base attack bonus, unless you have a character with heroic levels manning the guns. This is why ships with multiple weapon emplacements and the same number of gunners tend to have the same attack bonus listed in their stat block.
For weapon batteries, you have the primary gunner, then each additional gunner in the battery is treated as aiding the primary gunner, giving a +2 bonus to the attack roll. So, for instance a heavy turbolaser battery on an Imperial Star Destroyer has an attack bonus of +15. It gets +2 from having a skilled crew. There are five gunners in the battery, so the primary gunner has the +2 for being skilled, then the four other gunners apply a +2 bonus each to the primary gunner, bringing the attack bonus to +10. Then the ISDs Int is 20, giving a +5 modifier, which you then add to the attack bonus bringing it to the listed rating of +15.
Now, as listed in the core book, when firing a battery you add additional dice to the base damage for every 3 points your attack roll is above the targets reflex defense, up to the maximum number of gunners in the battery.
Lets say we have that same ISD, and lets call it the Devastator, firing on a Corellian Corvette. Just for the purposes of this example, we'll call it the Tantive IV, and its on a diplomatic mission. A CR90 corvette has a reflex defense of 16, and the Devastator has a attack bonus of +15, as previously mentioned. On a roll of 2 or higher, the Devastator does an automatic 11d10x5 damage to the Tantive IV. For every three points the Devastator's attack roll is higher than the Tantive IVs reflex defense, add +1d10 damage to the turbolasers damage before the damage is fully calculated, up to a max of +4d10. This is because there are 5 gunners in the battery, one is firing the primary gun for 11d10x5 damage, and the other four guns are helping, adding +1d10 damage per gunner. This means that the Devastator will have to roll a 13, bringing the final attack roll to 28, to fire every gun in the battery for a full 15d10x5 damage. Considering the Star Destroyer has 5 such batteries, and a host of other weapons, its no wonder these ships are so feared and respected across the galaxy. <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->P
