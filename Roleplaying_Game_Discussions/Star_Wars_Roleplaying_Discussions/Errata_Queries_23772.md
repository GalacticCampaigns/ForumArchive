I'm sure there was an errata related topic somewhere, but I can't seem to find it so....
Way back in ye olde SWSE book errata.
> p. 122-123 â€“ Table 8-3: Melee Weapons
> All damage entries in the â€œStunâ€ column of the table should be replaced with the word â€œYesâ€ except the stun baton, which should say â€œYes (2d6).â€

So... Bondar crystals are for training sabers only and my vibroblades can stun people?  :o

Well, in a sense, yes, Bondar crystals are only for training sabers, as they cannot kill anyone.
And no, your vibroblades cannot stun anyone, as they donÂ´t have a stun damage listed (or in later supplements, no "YES" under the stun entry)

But the errata apparently says every melee weapon in that table says YES for stun :P

It says all **damage entries** should be changed to say "YES". A "-" is not a damage entry, you only change it when it says an actual damage, like on Force Pikes or Stun Batons.

Hmm... so I see. Confuzzlement over. I leave this place for people to post questions if they have issues.
