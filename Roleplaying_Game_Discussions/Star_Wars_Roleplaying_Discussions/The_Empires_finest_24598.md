# The Empires finest

In my work with my stormtrooper game, I´ve done some research on how these soldiers are organized, equipped and trained. Inspired by wookiepedia articles, official stats and personal experiences(from games, movies, books) I have started to compile a document of stats for the various branches of stormtroopers.
I´ve chosen to sidestep the official stats for two reasons. The main one is that many of the stats are from rather early books (SECR and FU), and thus does not have access to newer feats and talents that might have been appropriate. The second is simply that I like statting my own NPCs. The only stat block that is from an official source is that of the basic trooper, which I gave a +1 Dexterity at level 4. Otherwise the types have been made using the standard stormtrooper array (12, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10) for abilities.
I thought to post it here for critique(constructive) and suggestions on how to improve it, and also for other people that might need stormtroopers for their games to look at. I´ve offered a few suggestions on how to advance each type in case you want to scale them up for higher level opposition, and as such have tried to make each type a bit unique, that you may want to advance them instead of replacing them. I will update as I add more types into it.

Maybe. However, they are issued to Field Troopers with lots of experience, and you have yet to complete your first assignment... <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

They're ok but I never liked how Stormtroopers are treated as mooks. They are after all the finest troops in the galaxy, I just think that at lower levels Pc's should be facing the imperial army or militias instead.

Finest in the Galaxy might be overdoing it, but finest in the Empire, no doubt.
I think the main reason we see stormtroopers everywhere is because that is one of their primary functions: To be a visible remainder of the power of the Empire. Secondly, since they are in fact the elite, you often find them sent in where the action is, while the regular troops (as I understands it) mainly is on garrison duty.
But yeah, I don´t think they should be treated as elite forces instead of mooks. Even though they may not be there to be the main opposition the PCs, they can at least try. For example, they got those Coordinated Attack feats for a reason, so a GM who constantly has all the troopers make individual attack rolls isn´t using their full potential, which of course makes them less useful.
