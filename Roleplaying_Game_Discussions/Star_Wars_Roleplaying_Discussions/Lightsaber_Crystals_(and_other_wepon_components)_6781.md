# Lightsaber Crystals (and other wepon components)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-02-15 07:40:25)

Ok, as you surely have noticed by now, I like creating RPG material <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I know it might not be fully necessary, but I thought IÂ´d stat out all the various crystals that can be used for lightsaber focuses across the Galaxy. Having these might provide adventures where players seeks a specific crystal out, or simply add more depth to the nature of the lightsaber. And IÂ´m not only focusing in the lightsaber, I am planning to make special components for other weapons as well (to be use with my new application of Tech Specialist). The power of such items is off course up to the GM to decide, since he decides how availible they are.
Anyway, these crystalsÂ´s bonuses replaces the old +1 attack for attuning your own lightsaber, but many still grants it. What do you think? I intentionally made tham more on the over- than underpowered side, because I think it is easier to reduce power than the other way around. Please give input, I especially want suggestions on how to balance the Mantle and the Heart, since I know they seem terribly unbalancing. But of course, they are unique, and known to be lost to the Galaxy...
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Lightsaber Components**</span>
[hide]**Adegan Crystals**: These are the most common crystals used for lighsaber focus by Jedi. They are found mostly in the Adegan system, primarily on the planet Ilum, but are also known to be found on the planet Halm. They are primarily blue and green in their colours, but they have been known to exist in other colors as well, if rarely. There are several types of Adegan crystals, who have different properties for focusing a lightsabers blade. The Mepthis crystal was the one typically used by Jedi. The rarer Pontite crystal had extraordinary focusing capabilities, and was superior to the Mephite. A lightsaber built with a Pontite crystal gains a +1 damage bonus. There were also the far more common Kathracite, Danite and Relacite. These crystals did not posses the same quality as Mephite, but were still adequate to channel a lightsaber blade, albeit a weaker one. A lightsaber with one of these crystals inside does one less dice of damage, making them perfect for training sabers. All Adegan crystals also grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
**Sigil Crystals**: These crystals are mined in the Sigil system, and when used in a lightsaber, they produces a yellow-brown blade. Inserting these into a lightsaber produces a searing blade, with capability of doing more damage. A lightsaber using a Sigil crystal gains a +2 damage bonus.
**Sapith Crystals**: These crystals are extremely rare, as they come as a waste product of the Volice worm, a creature from the Ssi-Ruuk homeworld of Lwhekk. It was extinct by the time of the Jedi Civil War, so no one knows if it any crystals remains. When used in a lightsaber, it produces a white-silver color, and also produces a blade that is more easy to handle than normal. A lightsaber using a Sapith crystal gets a +2 bonus to attack rolls, and a +2 bonus to damage rolls.
**Rubat Crystals**: Mined only on the planet Phemis, these crystals adds a yellow hue to a lightsaber blade. Like Adegan crystals, it has the properties required for focusing a lightsabers blade. A lightsaber using a Rubat crystal gets a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
**Opila Crystals**: These crystals were mined from an asteroid field in the Fyrth system. They produces a lightsaber blade with a blue hue. The blade generated by Opila crystals seems to be more intense than that of other crystals, and a lightsaber using an Opila crystal may consider the Damage Treshold of an opponent as being 2 points lower. If the crystal is refined and cleaned of impurities, then it becomes a variant called Jenruax, and provides a +1 attack bonus.
**Nextor Crystals**: These crystals produces a blue lightsaber blade that is more volatile than normal, but still controllable. They were mined in the mines of the planet MÂ´Haeli. A lightsaber that uses a Nextor crystal produces one additional dice of damage on a critical hit
**Quixoni Crystals**: Being an extreme rarity, the Quixoni crystals were formed in the supernova of an unknown planet. The gives a dark red hue to a lightsaber blade, and are also very close to the Dark Side of the Force. A person using a Quixoni crystal in a lightsaber may increase his Dark Side Score with one in order to produce the effect of spending a Force Point. This may be done once per encounter. Also, a lightsaber using a Quixoni crystal gets a +3 damage bonus.
**Ruusan Crystals**: Originating from the lost world of Ruusan, these crystals have absorbed some of the Force energy resting there, focused in the Valley of the Jedi. These crystals produces yellow and white colors on blades, and comes in variations, depending on their closeness to the Valley. They all grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls, and depeding on the quality, they grants a +1-5 bonus to all Use the Force checks made to directly use the lightsaber (Deflect, Block, Battle Strike, Lightsaber Throw...), and a +1 bonus in general to other Use the Force checks.
**Velmorite Crystals**: These crystals produces a yellow blade, and can be found on the planet Velmor. They produces a blade that is thinner than most, making it a weapon suitable for quick and precise strikes, as well as for defense. A lightsaber using a Velmorite crystal grants a +1 dodge bonus to Reflex Defense, and a +1 bonus to damage rolls if the wielder uses the Weapon Finesse feat.
**Damind Crystals**: These crystals are only know to be found on the planet Daminia. They produces a redish hue on a lightsaber blade, and also produces a more clearly defined blade, slightly longer than average. These crystals gives a +1 attack bonus when used in a lightsaber.
**Hurrikaine Crystals**: These rare and beautiful crystals from the planet Hurikaine produces lightsaber blades in the colors of violet and deep blue. When used in a lightsaber, the blade becomes more focused, capable of cutting nearly anything with great ease. A lightsaber with a Hurrikaine crystal may ignore all defense bonuses given by armor. They also provides a +1 attack and damage bonus.
**Bondar Crystals**: These crystals can only be found in a asteroid around Alderaan. After the Death Star attack, they have (understandingly) become much harder to find in the asteroid field. They have a orange-red color, and they are said to add stunning power to a lightsaber blade. If a lightsaber with a Bondar crystal makes enough damage to surpass the Damage Threshold of an opponent, then the opponent will also become dazed (taking a â€“1 penalty to attack rolls and skill checks during his next round).
**Eralam Crystals**: Made very rare as the Erai moon was bombarded by Sith forces, Eralam crystals are wellow to the color. They serve to produce a lightsaber blade of improved strength, giving a +1 attack and damage bonus to the lightsaber.
**Kasha Crystals**: Use by Cereans as meditation tools, Kasha crystals are clear and white, helping a person to clear his mind for meditation. It is unknown if anyone but Cereans can harness the special qualities of the crystals, but those who are able will be able to feel the Force a little more clearly. A person who uses a Kasha crystal (wether in a lightsaber or not) can use any Force Power not spent without removing it from his suite. This ability can be used once per encounter. As it helps focus the mind, a Kasha crystal also gives a +1 attack bonus.
**Stygium Crystals**: Mined on Aeten II and Maramere, Stygium crystals has been used primarily in cloaking devices. When used in a lightsaber, they produces a grey-matte-black blade that is partially transparent and casts lesser light than normally. Due to the elusive nature of the blade, a lightsaber with a Stygium crystal provides a +1 attack bonus.
**Solari Crystal**: A clearly orange-yellow crystal, the Solari crystal was a powerful artifact of the old Jedi order, and one of a kind. Utilized by Jedi Knight Shaela Nuur during the Great Hunt, the crystal was lost, but rumors claim that Revan found it during his quest for the Star Forge. The crystal resonates strongly in the Force, but is sensitive to the corruption of the Dark Side, and in order to bond with it, a person must be pure of heart and soul. A person who wishes to use this crystal in a lightsaber must have a Dark Side Score of 0, and should he ever increase it, he will loose acces to the crystals power, and must spend a new Force Point to bond with the crystal anew (in addition to reducing his Dark Side Score). When used in a lightsaber, this crystal grants a +1 attack and damage bonus, and if the opponent has a Dark Side Score and is Force Sensitive, these bonuses increases to +3.
**The Heart of the Guardian**: The Heart was a uniqe lightsaber crystal of unknown origin. It was found by the Rodian merchant Suvram Tan, and it is possible that he in turn sold it to the reformed Revan. The crystal has been lost ever since, and it is possible that Revan brought it with him on his journey into the Unknown Regions. When used in a lightsaber, the Heart produces a uniqe blade with a bronze hue and a white core. The Heart is belived to have belonged to a great Jedi warrior in the past, and to have absorbed som of his skill for channeling the Force in combat. It grants a +3 attack bonus, and adds an additional dice of damage to the lightsaber, as well as increases the damage die by one size. It also grants a wielder a +5 bonus to all uses of the Deflect and Block talents as well as removing the requirement to use a swift action to activate Lightsaber Defense.
**The Mantle of the Force**: Along with the Heart of the Guardian, the Mantle was found by Suvram Tan, and he may possibly have sold it to the reformed Revan. The Mantle is a ancient artifact, and one of the most Force-attuned crystals in the Galaxy. When insterted into a lightsaber, it produces a blade that has a silver-cyan glow. Unlike its counterpart, the Mantle does not favor a specific use of the Force, but rather enhances the Force abilities of anyone using it. It gives a +2 attack bonus, and a +3 bonus to all Use the Force checks, and it also grants the wielder the benefit of one instance of the Force Point Recovery technique.[/hide]
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Blaster Weapon Components**</span>
[hide]**Ion Power Cell**: By installing an Ion Power Cell, you can make a weapon fire ionized shots rather than superheated plasma, allowing for a more versatile weapon. Installing the Ion Cell gives the weapon a new firing mode in wich it deals Ion damage rather than energy.
**Beam Focus**: By installing a Beam Focus, you can have your weapon focus the power of its blast into a concentrated beam rather than a single blast. Installing a Beam Focus gives your weapon a new fire mode. When in the new mode, each shot does damage equal to the average number for the type of damage dice the weapon has x (the number of damage dice you would normally roll when using the weapon -1). This mode cannot be used in conjunction with the Rapid Shot feat, but the Deadeye feat may be used. If used against a stationary object in this mode, treat the object as having a DR that is 10 points lower than normal.[/hide]

I'm all for adding customization to a game, especially when it comes to weapons. I'm a combat junkie, when it comes to games.
I will throw this comment in, however: nearly all over these crystals add attack and damage to the lightsaber? Aren't Jedi not suppose to want to inflict more damage? Though the refer to a lightsaber as a "tool of peace", all the modification available- or at least all the popular ones- deal with inflicting more damage, better at cutting off limbs, and other wise dealing harm.
And minor nick pick:
> Quixoni Crystals: Being an extreme rarity, the Quixoni crystals were formed in the supernova of an unknown planet.

Planets don't super-nova; stars do. I am guessing they planet was caught in a supernova, and the resulting charred, melted slag that used to ba planet had some pretty cool crystals in it?
On to the positive stuff. How else can one customize a lightsaber, aside from the crystals? Double lightsabers are some what popular, as are "great saber" (longer than normal), short sabers, and my personal favorite: the pole arm saber (meter plus long hilt, looks like a spear with a meter long lightsaber blade at the end). Light whips aren't technically, lightsabers, so I won't talk about them. Tonfa sabers also exist.
A stun setting would be cool, like the training sabers. A crystal that added bonuses to healing, move object, or whatever. An ion setting- not particularly popular, giving the original saber's ability to 'disable' droids- would be interesting. How about something that widened the blade, and made it easy to use as a shield? A grappling hook could be added in, with the hook exiting near the blade end (need to cut the line real quick? Turn the blade on). Modifications to work under water, if they don't do that already. I hate the idea of a silenced saber- half the coolness is the sounds a light saber makes. Ancient sabers required a power pack that was hooked to your waist, and had a cord running to the hilt (THAT would get annoying).
I don't think increasing the critical threat range is a good idea as Improved Critical has been removed from the game. Increasing the multiplier to x3 (and to x4 with Triple Crit) might...*might* work. I think this should be something you could do without a special crystal, but that's just me. What about beefing up the construction of the hilt? Make the hilt tougher, weave some saber resistant material in there.
Ooo...here is a good idea for a crystal: one that let's you get away with being a darksider. It hides the taint of the Dark Side, even from the users. Commit an evil act, and you don't feel any worse than you were before. You might even feel better. No worries about you friends sensing you growing darkness, because you nifty saber eats the evil away. You can do those things that are necessary, that might just break the Jedi code, and you won't suffer any consequences for it. Because, after all, you're doing good, you are doing what needs to be done...(the crystal hides the presence of say, eight, Dark Side points from anyone looking, including the user. Go too far into the darkside, however, and all come crashing down. Welcome to an easy way to earning that 'Darth' title).
That was...kinda fun. I'll have to try out some more ideas, later. Take it easy

Yeah, I meant the star went nova, minor typo.
IÂ´ve just been working of the list of crystals found on Wookiepedia and the crystals from KOTOR. Most of the crystals do indeed give attack and damage bonuses. The attack bonuses is partly because this bonus from crystals would come instead of a +1 attack when building your own lightsaber and attuning it, and I didnÂ´t want to mess too much wich the RAW. And also, I canÂ´t really think of too many ways a crystal could alter a lightsabers blade other than making it more defined, thinner, more intense...I tried to translate the Wookiepedia descriptions of what the crystals so to the blade into game terms, and it resulted in mostly attack and damage bonuses. Some crystals can help you focus more in the Force, and some crystals (like Velmorite) have other uses.
You can still also use Tech Specialist on the lightsaber hilt of course, but I hadnÂ´t really thought of making any more mods to the saber (not going the whole KOTOR way), since I donÂ´t want to unbalance them, and IÂ´m having a hard time coming up with reasonable components for other weapons. But I was thinking of having certain crystals interact better in certain sabers (like Velmorite in *Shoto* and Damind for Dual-Phase sabers). And for training sabers you do have the weaker versions of Adegan crystals.
Oh, and I also added some of the things I come up with for Blaster Weapons.

At this stage, I don't think I'd allow any of these in my game. All of them are more powerful than the current RAW lightsaber. I think this is a mistake - in most cases, except the rarest and most difficult to get hold of, they should just be different, not better. Let's not forget that on the whole Saga emphasises flavour over intricate mechanical tinkering. And all it takes to make my players happy is giving them more than a couple of colour choices.
I'm particularly not a fan of the Sapith crystal. I realise you're not responsible for the fluff, so this isn't really a complaint directed at you, but how can one beam of light be more easily controlled than another beam of light? Gah, silliness.

Since the Ion Power Cell is designed to allow a weapon that usually doesn't have a stun mode have a stun mode, I'd consider applying a diminishing effect on its normal attack mode in return. Alternatively, I'd consider making this ability a function of the Tech Specialist feat. Or both - with the Tech Specialist ability giving a weapon a stun mode, and the power cell giving a weapon a stun mode but in exchange for one less die of regular damage.
Beam Focus seems rather powerful. Let's take a blaster rifle: 3d8x4= 12-96 damage in any one attack. And that's without factoring in a character's heroic bonus. Suddenly we have character scale weapons that can realistically taken on starfighters.

> > **Stygium Crystals**: Mined on Aeten II and Maramere, Stygium crystals has been used primarily in cloaking devices. When used in a lightsaber, they produces a grey-matte-black blade that is partially transparent and casts lesser light than normally. Due to the elusive nature of the blade, a lightsaber with a Stygium crystal provides a +1 attack bonus.
> > **Solari Crystal**: A clearly orange-yellow crystal, the Solari crystal was a powerful artifact of the old Jedi order, and one of a kind. Utilized by Jedi Knight Shaela Nuur during the Great Hunt, the crystal was lost, but rumors claim that Revan found it during his quest for the Star Forge. The crystal resonates strongly in the Force, but is sensitive to the corruption of the Dark Side, and in order to bond with it, a person must be pure of heart and soul. A person who wishes to use this crystal in a lightsaber must have a Dark Side Score of 0, and should he ever increase it, he will loose acces to the crystals power, and must spend a new Force Point to bond with the crystal anew (in addition to reducing his Dark Side Score). When used in a lightsaber, this crystal grants a +1 attack and damage bonus, and if the opponent has a Dark Side Score and is Force Sensitive, these bonuses increases to +3.
> > **The Heart of the Guardian**: The Heart was a uniqe lightsaber crystal of unknown origin. It was found by the Rodian merchant Suvram Tan, and it is possible that he in turn sold it to the reformed Revan. The crystal has been lost ever since, and it is possible that Revan brought it with him on his journey into the Unknown Regions. When used in a lightsaber, the Heart produces a uniqe blade with a bronze hue and a white core. The Heart is belived to have belonged to a great Jedi warrior in the past, and to have absorbed som of his skill for channeling the Force in combat. It grants a +3 attack bonus, and adds an additional dice of damage to the lightsaber, as well as increases the damage die by one size. It also grants a wielder a +5 bonus to all uses of the Deflect and Block talents as well as removing the requirement to use a swift action to activate Lightsaber Defense.
> > **The Mantle of the Force**: Along with the Heart of the Guardian, the Mantle was found by Suvram Tan, and he may possibly have sold it to the reformed Revan. The Mantle is a ancient artifact, and one of the most Force-attuned crystals in the Galaxy. When insterted into a lightsaber, it produces a blade that has a silver-cyan glow. Unlike its counterpart, the Mantle does not favor a specific use of the Force, but rather enhances the Force abilities of anyone using it. It gives a +2 attack bonus, and a +3 bonus to all Use the Force checks, and it also grants the wielder the benefit of one instance of the Force Point Recovery technique.[/hide]

At this stage, I don't think I'd allow any of these in my game. All of them are more powerful than the current RAW lightsaber. I think this is a mistake - in most cases, except the rarest and most difficult to get hold of, they should just be different, not better. Let's not forget that on the whole Saga emphasises flavour over intricate mechanical tinkering. And all it takes to make my players happy is giving them more than a couple of colour choices.
I'm particularly not a fan of the Sapith crystal. I realise you're not responsible for the fluff, so this isn't really a complaint directed at you, but how can one beam of light be more easily controlled than another beam of light? Gah, silliness.
Yeah, I agree that most of them are more powerful, but I wanted there to be some additional element of customization. And the Sapith crystal is strange, they say the blade is more intense and thus easier to control...but I donÂ´t know...itÂ´s really rare though, so I thought the bonus ok. What do you think about making this an option to the Tech Spec feat? You can do one or the other, but not both.

Since the Ion Power Cell is designed to allow a weapon that usually doesn't have a stun mode have a stun mode, I'd consider applying a diminishing effect on its normal attack mode in return. Alternatively, I'd consider making this ability a function of the Tech Specialist feat. Or both - with the Tech Specialist ability giving a weapon a stun mode, and the power cell giving a weapon a stun mode but in exchange for one less die of regular damage.
Beam Focus seems rather powerful. Let's take a blaster rifle: 3d8x4= 12-96 damage in any one attack. And that's without factoring in a character's heroic bonus. Suddenly we have character scale weapons that can realistically taken on starfighters.
Oh, that may not have been clear, but these were to be used with a new application of the Tech Spec feat: "Install Special Component" (see the Custom Content section in the forum for my game). So installing one of these components will count as using the Tech Spec feat on the weapon. And Ion isnÂ´t really stun...except for if you use it against Droids and Cybernethics. But those are more options to toy with...perhaps a more powerful Stun Cell, allowing for Stun at a longer range.
Beam focus is the *number* of dice x the average value, so for a Blaster Rifle that would be 4x4=16 dmg per shot. Or in other words, the exact average of the weapons damage. The idea was that it fires a choerent beam rather than blaster bolts, and the DR loweing would represent the effects of being similar to a cutting laser if held focused on a object. But maybe it should not be exactly the average, that could be too powerful. IÂ´m considering dropping the weapons number of dice by 1, so a Blaster Rifle in this mode would be 3x4=12 dmg. Maybe that could work?

> > > [hide]**Adegan Crystals**: These are the most common crystals used for lighsaber focus by Jedi. They are found mostly in the Adegan system, primarily on the planet Ilum, but are also known to be found on the planet Halm. They are primarily blue and green in their colours, but they have been known to exist in other colors as well, if rarely. There are several types of Adegan crystals, who have different properties for focusing a lightsabers blade. The Mepthis crystal was the one typically used by Jedi. The rarer Pontite crystal had extraordinary focusing capabilities, and was superior to the Mephite. A lightsaber built with a Pontite crystal gains a +1 damage bonus. There were also the far more common Kathracite, Danite and Relacite. These crystals did not posses the same quality as Mephite, but were still adequate to channel a lightsaber blade, albeit a weaker one. A lightsaber with one of these crystals inside does one less dice of damage, making them perfect for training sabers. All Adegan crystals also grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
> > > **Sigil Crystals**: These crystals are mined in the Sigil system, and when used in a lightsaber, they produces a yellow-brown blade. Inserting these into a lightsaber produces a searing blade, with capability of doing more damage. A lightsaber using a Sigil crystal gains a +2 damage bonus.
> > > **Sapith Crystals**: These crystals are extremely rare, as they come as a waste product of the Volice worm, a creature from the Ssi-Ruuk homeworld of Lwhekk. It was extinct by the time of the Jedi Civil War, so no one knows if it any crystals remains. When used in a lightsaber, it produces a white-silver color, and also produces a blade that is more easy to handle than normal. A lightsaber using a Sapith crystal gets a +2 bonus to attack rolls, and a +2 bonus to damage rolls.
> > > **Rubat Crystals**: Mined only on the planet Phemis, these crystals adds a yellow hue to a lightsaber blade. Like Adegan crystals, it has the properties required for focusing a lightsabers blade. A lightsaber using a Rubat crystal gets a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
> > > **Opila Crystals**: These crystals were mined from an asteroid field in the Fyrth system. They produces a lightsaber blade with a blue hue. The blade generated by Opila crystals seems to be more intense than that of other crystals, and a lightsaber using an Opila crystal may consider the Damage Treshold of an opponent as being 2 points lower. If the crystal is refined and cleaned of impurities, then it becomes a variant called Jenruax, and provides a +1 attack bonus.
> > > **Nextor Crystals**: These crystals produces a blue lightsaber blade that is more volatile than normal, but still controllable. They were mined in the mines of the planet MÂ´Haeli. A lightsaber that uses a Nextor crystal produces one additional dice of damage on a critical hit
> > > **Quixoni Crystals**: Being an extreme rarity, the Quixoni crystals were formed in the supernova of an unknown planet. The gives a dark red hue to a lightsaber blade, and are also very close to the Dark Side of the Force. A person using a Quixoni crystal in a lightsaber may increase his Dark Side Score with one in order to produce the effect of spending a Force Point. This may be done once per encounter. Also, a lightsaber using a Quixoni crystal gets a +3 damage bonus.
> > > **Ruusan Crystals**: Originating from the lost world of Ruusan, these crystals have absorbed some of the Force energy resting there, focused in the Valley of the Jedi. These crystals produces yellow and white colors on blades, and comes in variations, depending on their closeness to the Valley. They all grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls, and depeding on the quality, they grants a +1-5 bonus to all Use the Force checks made to directly use the lightsaber (Deflect, Block, Battle Strike, Lightsaber Throw&amp;amp;#8230;), and a +1 bonus in general to other Use the Force checks.
> > > **Velmorite Crystals**: These crystals produces a yellow blade, and can be found on the planet Velmor. They produces a blade that is thinner than most, making it a weapon suitable for quick and precise strikes, as well as for defense. A lightsaber using a Velmorite crystal grants a +1 dodge bonus to Reflex Defense, and a +1 bonus to damage rolls if the wielder uses the Weapon Finesse feat.
> > > **Damind Crystals**: These crystals are only know to be found on the planet Daminia. They produces a redish hue on a lightsaber blade, and also produces a more clearly defined blade, slightly longer than average. These crystals gives a +1 attack bonus when used in a lightsaber.
> > > **Hurrikaine Crystals**: These rare and beautiful crystals from the planet Hurikaine produces lightsaber blades in the colors of violet and deep blue. When used in a lightsaber, the blade becomes more focused, capable of cutting nearly anything with great ease. A lightsaber with a Hurrikaine crystal may ignore all defense bonuses given by armor. They also provides a +1 attack and damage bonus.
> > > **Bondar Crystals**: These crystals can only be found in a asteroid around Alderaan. After the Death Star attack, they have (understandingly) become much harder to find in the asteroid field. They have a orange-red color, and they are said to add stunning power to a lightsaber blade. If a lightsaber with a Bondar crystal makes enough damage to surpass the Damage Threshold of an opponent, then the opponent will also become dazed (taking a â€“1 penalty to attack rolls and skill checks during his next round).
> > > **Eralam Crystals**: Made very rare as the Erai moon was bombarded by Sith forces, Eralam crystals are wellow to the color. They serve to produce a lightsaber blade of improved strength, giving a +1 attack and damage bonus to the lightsaber.
> > > **Kasha Crystals**: Use by Cereans as meditation tools, Kasha crystals are clear and white, helping a person to clear his mind for meditation. It is unknown if anyone but Cereans can harness the special qualities of the crystals, but those who are able will be able to feel the Force a little more clearly. A person who uses a Kasha crystal (wether in a lightsaber or not) can use any Force Power not spent without removing it from his suite. This ability can be used once per encounter.

Hm, well - involving Tech Specialist might work, but how many Jedi are really going to end up with that feat? An alternative would be to increase the DC of building the lightsaber relative to the power of the crystal. Each additional +1 bonus (or equivalent) would increase the DC by 5, or somesuch.

Well done for calling me on the Ion/Stun thing. I jsut remembered the mechanics, which are identical in most respects.
As for the Beam Focus clarification - ah, that's a lot less dodgy then. You should think about rewording the description to make it clearer though. I think you may be right that exactly average is a bit too powerful, dropping one of the dice sounds right. My other concern would be that always doing the same damage is, well, boring. It's fine against an object, but it'd suck the fun out of a combat. Since combatants, as a rule, are moving or able to move, and the effect of a beam fired on a moving target would probably be about the same as the effect of a normal blaster bolt, I'd specify that the mode can only be used against objects.

Increasing the DC for crafting the lightsaber is not a bad idea at all. Will have to look that over though, not to get any impossible DCs. What I meant with Tech Spec was to make it mutually exclusive, so that you could not have the benefit of both a special crystal and using Tech Spec on the lightsaber.
IÂ´ve reworded the Beam Focus description to be more clear. IÂ´ve just read the *Republic Commando* books, and they had some kind of low-powered laser (not blaster) that was used as a stunning weapon. I was thinking that using Beam Focus mode would be something like that, it aÂ´ppears not to be too hard to aim with. And I certainly agree itÂ´s dull always doing the same damage, but I thought there might be people out there that would like to be certain that one shot will drop a mook. But I also considered it more of a cutting laser, so maybe this one should be for attacking objects only. IÂ´ll try to create stats for something similar to the commando laser.

### **Rowen** (2008-08-20 15:33:30)

That was a pretty interesting read. I like the idea of crystals augmenting lightsabers.
As for weapons of other types, you can create a "hair trigger" for many blaster type weapons. Giving, quite possibly a plus on the wielders initiative roll. Since the increased sensitivity of the trigger would cause one to fire off a shot faster.
Adding laser targeting to the same blasters could also improve ones 'to-hit' chances.
I don't know just suggestions. I would also say that there should be some chances that the modifications could cause trouble with the authorities, depending on the era of play. Not only would this make any substantial mods risky but difficult to obtain unless sought at the black market.

### **Thraken** (2008-10-18 20:39:06)

After having read the KOTOR guide, it gives us some idea what they consider balanced alternate lightsaber crystals. I also feel that whoever named the crystals lost the plot somewhat as some names appear to have been slapped on randomly.
The most glaring example being teh great Solari crystal - a powerful crystal whose power can only be harnessed by a true jedi of light. Is a lightsaber deflection crystal =|
Suffice it to say I've had a stab at creating needlessly complicated lightsaber conversions, rules, alternate crystals as well as a redistributed table of the "official" alternate lightsaber crystals.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-21 17:24:50)

Ok, hereÂ´s an update of my list of lightsaber crystals:
[hide]**Adegan Crystal** â€“ The most common crystal, the Adegan crystals comes in different variants: Kathracite, Danite, Relacite, Mephite and Pontite. The first three are the most common variations, however, they lack the necessary properties to form a fully perfected lightsaber blade. A lightsaber that uses one of these crystals has a damage dice of one size smaller than normal. The Mephite are the most commonly used crystals by the Jedi, and they does not alter the properties of the blade at all. Pontite crystals are rare, but they are a near-perfect focus for a lightsaber blade. A lightsaber built with a pontite crystal has a damage dice of one size larger than normal. A character who crafts his own lightsaber using any type of Adegan crystal gains a +1 crystal bonus when using the lightsaber.
**Where:** Primarily the Adega system and the planet Ilum **Colors:** Primarily blue and green
**Bondar Crystal** â€“ Bondar crystals alters the properties of a lightsabers blade, and creates a duller, not quite as focused energy blade as many other crystals. A lightsaber built with a bondar crystal deals stun damage to an opponent, instead of normal damage, and is thus perfect for training sabers.
**Where:** An asteroid in far orbit around Alderaan **Colors:** Primarily Yellow, Green and Blue
**Firkrann/Luxum Crystal** â€“ These two crystals gives the blade of a lightsaber an electrical charge, turning it into a energy beam of low threat to a normal living being, but instead it emitts a powerful ion charge that can be devastating to droids, cyborgs and veichles. I lightsaber built with a Firkrann or Luxum crystal deals ion damage, and the Firkrann crystal also grants a +2 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Firkrann crystals are mined on the desert planet of Rafa V, and Luxum crystals are constructed through extensive meditation in the dark energies of Lake Natth on the planet Ambria **Colors:** Pimarily White and Light Blue
**Opila** â€“ The Opila crystal provides an excellent focus for a lightsaber blade, generating a more focused and intense blade, increasing the weapons ability to cut through materials with ease. A lightsaber built with an Opila crystal deals an additional dice of damage on a critical hit (applied after the damage multiplier), and also adds +2 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Mined in the asteroid field in the Fyrth system **Colors:** Pimarily Dark Blue and Violet
**Jenraux** â€“ By refining the Opila crystal, cleaning it of any impurities, the Jenraux crystal is produced. This crystal can create a slightly wider energy blade, making it easier to intercept projectiles. A lightsaber built with a Jenraux crystal gives its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to all Use the Force/Control checks to use the Deflect talent, as well as a +1 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Created by refining Opila crystals **Colors:** Pimarily Blue, Orange or Yellow
**Phond** â€“ Phond crystals possesses highly rare structures and consistency, and can be used to create a more fiercely burning lighsaber blade, that is harder to stop. A lightsaber built with a Phond crystal may deal only slashing damage instead of energy/slashing on any attack.
**Where:** Created as a byproduct when making alloys, reasons and circumstances yet unknown **Colors:** Pimarily Red, Orange and Bronze
**Rubat** â€“ A Rubat crystal holds a lot of qualities making it suitable for useage in a lightsaber. It creates a more well-defined blade than other crystals, allowing the wielder to track its movements more easily, thus allowing for greater control of the blade. A lightsaber built with a Rubat crystal grants its wielder a +1 crystal bonus to all attack and damage rolls when using the weapon.
**Where:** The planet Phemis **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow, Orange
**Sigil** â€“ When inserted into a lightsaber, a Sigil crystal produces a searing effect on the blade, greatly increasing its damage output. A lightsaber built with a Sigil crystal increaes the size of its damage dice by 1 step, and also adds a +1 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Mined expensively in the Sigil system **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow, Bronze
**Solari** â€“ The Solari crystal is a unique lightsaber crystal, strongly attuned to the Light Side of the Force, and greatly increased the atuunement to the living Force of anyone who bonded used it. It requires a wielder to be pure of heart and soul, otherwise it will not allow a user to tap into its powers. A lightsaber built with the Solari crystal grants its wielder +3 crystal bonus to all attack and damage rolls when using the lightsaber, as well as a +5 crystal bonus when using the *Rebuke*/*Force Defense* Force Power against a Force Power with the [Dark Side] descriptor. If the wielder has a Dark Side Score greater than 0, he cannot tap into the power of the crystal, and looses all its bonuses until he reddems himself.
**Where:** Last found by Revan on Korriban, but no one knows where it is now **Colors:** Brilliantly shining light orange
**Upari** â€“ Upari crystal have been used by the wookies on Kashyyk as jewelry for a long time. The crystal is brittle, but some are capable enough to be used as focuses in lightsabers. Through various ways of cutting the crystal, and the Force, Jedi Masters have been known to utilize these crystals to create a variety of effects. A lightsaber built with a Upari crystal produces one of the following effects (permanently chosen at time of construction): +1 to all attack rolls, +2 crystal bonus to all damage rolls, +2 crystal bonus to Use the Force/Control checks to use the Deflect talent, +2 crystal bonus to Use the Force/Control checks to use the Block talent or a +1 dodge bonus to Reflex Defense when using the Lightsaber Defense talent.
**Where:** Orbit around forest worlds like Kashyyk **Colors:** Pimarily Light Blue, Turquoise
**Eralam** â€“ Eralam crystals are built in a way that fulfills nearly all the wishes for a lightsaber crystal, and can produce a clear and stable blade. A lightsabr built using a Eralam crystal adds +1 crystal bonus to all attack rolls and a +2 to all damage rolls made using the lightsaber.
**Where:** Third moon of Erai, but were made scarce when the Sith bombarded the planet **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow, Orange
**Sapith** â€“ Sapith crystals generates a very focused lightsaber blade, and one that is very easy to handle, even for an unskilled user. A lightsaber built with a Sapith crystal grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to all attack rolls using the lightsaber.
**Where:** Excrement from the now-extinct Volice worm, living on Lwhekk **Colors:** Pimarily White, Green
**Damind** â€“ Damind crystal can alter the length of a lightsaber blade, making it slightly longer than the average blade, thus making it easier to reach an opponent in battle. The blade would also widen slightly, allowing a wielder better protection against incoming projectiles. A lightsaber built with a Damind crystal grants its wielder a +1 crystal bonus to all attack rolls when using the lightsaber, as well as a +1 crystal bonus to all Use the Force/Control checks to use the Deflect talent.
**Where:** The planet of Daminia **Colors:** Pimarily Purple, Violet, Red
**Nextor** â€“ Whe inserted into a lightsaber, Nextor crystal generates a highly volatile blade, but still manages to keep it stable. This leads to a weapon that can inflict terrible amounts of damage, but that is somewhat unstable in its effects. A lightsaber built with a Nextor crystal increases its threat range by 1 (a natural 19 is not an automatic hit though), but a user takes a -2 penalty to all attack rolls made using the weapon.
**Where:** The mountains of MÂ´haeli **Colors:** Pimarily Blue, White
**Dragite** â€“ Dragite crystals are perhaps not meant to be used in a lightsaber, but the properties they creates are most interesting indeed. Upon contact, these crystals created a loud resonance, something that can sear an opponent, but also allowed a Jedi to use it against the normally undeflectable sonic weapons. A lightsaber built with a Dragite crystal adds +1 sonic damage to all attack rolls (will be inflicted even if the attack is stopped using the Block talent), and also allows the wielder to use the Deflect (not Redirect Shot) talent against weapons that deals sonic damage, but they takes a -10 penalty to their Use the Force/Control checks when doing so.
**Where:** The mountains of MÂ´haeli**Colors:** Pimarily Violet
**Kasha** â€“ Kasha crystals have traditionally been used as meditation tools by Cereans, inscribing patterns on each face of the crystal, using them to clear ones mind for meditation. When inserted into a lightsaber, it has no specific effect on the blades properties, but for one attuned to the crystal, its meditative and soothing abilities can be felt even in the heat of battle. A lightsaber built with a Kasha crystal grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to his Will Defense, and allows him to reroll one of the bonus dice gained from spending a Force Point when using it on an attack roll, and take the better result.
**Where:** Crafted by the Cerans **Colors:** Pimarily White
**Qixoni** â€“ Qixoni crystals are extreemly rare, and they have been heavily exposed to the Dark Side of the Force, making them a most useful tool to channel the power of ones anger and hate through. A lightsaber built with a Qixoni crystal grants its wielder a crystal bonus to all damage rolls equal to half his Dark Side Score.
**Where:** Only a few exists, they were formed in a supernova of an unknown star **Colors:** Dark Red
**Lorrdian Gemstone** â€“ Lorrdian Gemstones has been imbued with some degree of kinetic communication, allowing a wielder to better predict the actions of others. A lightsaber built using a Lorrdian Gemstone grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to Use the Force/Control check to use the Deflect and Block talents.
**Where:** Created during the Kanz disorders, no one knows where (or if) any remains **Colors:** Pimarily Violet, Purple
**Velmorite** â€“ Velmorite crystals are typically used to craft fine energy swords, and such properties seems to translate well into a lightsaber blade. Such a lightsabers blade tends to be slimmer and finer than others, creating a blade that can be wielded with grace and skill. A lightsaber built with a Velmorite crystal adds +1 to the dodge bonus given by the Lightsaber Defense talent, and also adds a +1 crystal bonus to attack rolls if the lightsaber is used with the Weapon Finesse feat.
**Where:** The planet Velmor **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow
**Barab Ore Ignot** â€“ Barab Ore has been exposed to high levels of radiation, and when used in a lightsaber, it creates a fiercly burning blade, almost impossible to control. A lightsaber built with a Barab Ore Ignot adds fire to its damage type, in addition to energy and slashing.
**Where:** Mined on the surface of Barab I **Colors:** Pimarily Gray, Black
**Ruusan** â€“ Ruusan crystals are extremely attuned to the Force, probabl due to the prescense of the Valley of the Jedi on the planet where they can be found. They do not alter the properties of a lightsabers blade to any high degree, but a character using such a crystal can always feel the Force clearer and easier than others. A lightsaber built with a Ruusan crystal grants its wielder a +1 crystal bonus to all Use the Force/Force Skill checks.
**Where:** The lost world of Ruusan, all crystals were supposedly lost at the time of the Ruusan Reformation **Colors:** Pimarily White, Yellow
**The Heart of the Guardian** â€“ A one of a kind crystal, The Heart is one of a pair of legendary lightsaber crystals that grants their wielders remarkable powers. Typically, they have the ability to enhance the effects of other lightsaber crystals, and are thus of most use in multi-phased lightsabers. The Heart tends to increase a wielders ability to call upon the Force in combat, and to use it to enhance his own battle prowess. A lightsaber built with the Heart of the Guardian grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to all attack and damage rolls made using the lightsaber, as well as grant a wielder a +5 crystal bonus to all Use the Force/Control checks to use the Deflect and Block talents. Any character also using the *Battle Strike* Force Power is treated as having spent a Force Point to increase its effect at every use. If the lightsaber contains multiple crystals, any crystal bonus granted to attack rolls or damage rolls are doubled, and are also allowed to stack.
**Where:** Last known to be in posession of Revan, but no one knows where it is. Jedi prophecies claims that it will appear in the time of greatest turmoil to bring salvation to the Galaxy **Colors:** Bright Red-Orange
**The Mantle of the Force** â€“ A one of a kind crystal, The Mantle is one of a pair of legendary lightsaber crystals that grants their wielders remarkable powers. Typically, they have the ability to enhance the effects of other lightsaber crystals, and are thus of most use in multi-phased lightsabers. The Mantle enhances a wielders connection to the Force, and resonates strongly with other Force Sensitive crystals. A lightsaber built with the Mantle of the Force grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to all Use the Force/Force Skill checks, and allows a character to increase the DC of any Force Power he uses by 10 in order to simulate spending a Force Point to increase its effect. If the lightsaber contains multiple crystals, any crystal bonus granted by the other crystals is increased by 1, and are also allowed to stack. **Where:** Last known to be in posession of Revan, but no one knows where it is **Colors:** Bright Silver-Cyan
There exists other types of crystals as well, but they lacks any property that makes them stand out, except for that some of them are the only known ways to create a lightsaber blade of a certain color. However, all such crystals provides a +1 crystal bonus to attack rolls when used in a lightsaber. Such crystals includes
[ul]
[*]**Druindfire** â€“ A rare crystal found on Tatooine. Adds a silver glance to a lightsabers blade.  
[*]**Viridian** â€“ Rare crystals, often used by Jedi and Sith as a symbol of honor and rank. Produces a silvery-green (viridian) lightsaber blade. [/ul][/hide]

Hmm, some nice ideas you have in there. Overall our differences come from different design philosophy I think.
I've tried to suppress the KOTOR game bonuses as much as possible to be as usable and minimally unbalancing as possible. By the looks of your crystals they range from being slightly less powerful than my versions to being much more powerful, the main difference being multiple benefits from a single crystal.

IÂ´ve used a combination of the KOTORI & II stats, the KOTOR sourcebook stats, and the wookiepedia descriptions of the crystals to try and form my own opinion of what kind of bonus they should give.
I donÂ´t think that the main difference is multiple benefits, since a lot of your crystals has that as well. But more the fact that I donÂ´t think 1/encounter abilities are appropriate for crystals, while a lot of yours has those.

### **Thraken** (2008-10-22 13:05:17)

> A crystal listed as having more than one effect may only impart one effect to the lightsaber, chosen when spending an FP to attune the lightsaber.

:P While there are almost certainly holes in my stuff they are somewhat comprehensive.
The once per encounter thing is something from the campaign guide. I chose to accept it as a somewhat random but only slightly advantageous way of depicting the extra dies of damage seen in the game crystals. When applied to force powers and skills, that's a way I used to adjust the strength of the power appropriate to the crystal.
After looking at your stuff I may decide upon changing how some of my damage types work. And on another note - your Quixoni is rather powerful o_O I mean a WIS 14 dark sider gets +7 damage.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-22 13:22:51)

Ah, youÂ´re right, so your crystals only uses one effect.
I did away with 1/encounter effects since I think that something that will be in your possesion all the time should give a little more than that. Also, I mean to put a lot of emphasis on that these crystals are rare. Even if you know where they are found, it isnÂ´t certain youÂ´ll find one suitable for a lightsaber right away. The only ones that are somewhat common are the Adegan crystals of course, if you go to Ilum youÂ´ll probably find one suitable right away, question is whatkind of crystal it will be. I like the rules from the Jedi Counceling and the ones you made, IÂ´ll probably have similar things for the other crystals as well.
And yes, the Qixoni crystals can be very powerful, but thatÂ´s the point. They are also super rare (I think only a handful ever existed), so they should be wothwhile searching for if one desperately wants one. But finding the Solari crystal is equally powerful (if not more) for a lightsaber. But I could for example say that Palpatine had a Qixoni crystal in his saber, and then the whole Ep III duel becomes easier to explain.

Or maybe Yoda was rolling nothing higher then 7 when he attacked or the times he does land a hit Palpatine used block and prevented it from happening.

Actually I meant the earlier duel, where Palpatine slices through 3 Jedi Masters in very rapid succession. Having +10 damage would really help with that wouldnÂ´t you say?

### **Akisa** (2008-10-23 02:13:25)

Or destiny spamage to the point he only has 4 before the fight with Yoda.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-23 04:25:21)

> Or destiny spamage to the point he only has 4 before the fight with Yoda.

Yup, he used quite a lot of destiny points there as well, but having a +10 to damage wouldnÂ´t really be inappropriate to reflect what we see him do with his saber on-screen, is it?

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-23 09:59:09)

Or the all holy ultimate GM (a bloke called george) wrote that they had to die :P
The novelisation apparently makes an attempt to stretch things out and fluff it out a bit, but it's hard to equate these RPG systems with the movies anyway. Blasters and lightsabers aren't often one hit kills in here :P

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-23 10:12:39)

ThatÂ´s true, but a +10 helps a long way towards that :
Anyway, I think those crystals are ok, and IÂ´m working on some rules to build the lightsaber right now.

---

### **Thraken** (2008-10-23 11:55:11)

determined to compete with complete sets of rules then... <!-- s:evil: -->![:icon_evil:](https://i.ibb.co/C5wQfzF6/icon-evil.gif)<!-- s:evil: -->
Heh, eh well. One note which may be another difference between out design philosophies is that, while different crystals are *very very* rare, I don't want them to be so rare that the rules are never used. Taking into account that these are GM created adventures and the players are 'the player characters', depending on the campaign they should get some to play with without overly unbalancing things.
Then again I'm a noob so I know nothing <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-23 12:14:25)

Well, not competing, I just like to do things myself :P
And of course the rules should be used. Most crystals arenÂ´t overpowered as I see it, and only a few really produces very extreme effects. But getting a special crystal for your lightsaber should be a project of its own, IMO , and might require a short (or long) adventure of its own. Tracking down the Heart or the Mantle would be nearly impossible, and probably take a lot of time, but given their powers, it would be woth it.

Well with the heroes it's not one shot either, when Leia was hit with a blaster shot she went down because of a critical hit. Two possibilities they haven't updated to Saga and using the Revised Core Edition or if they did update to Saga she just simple went down two condition track (she was still conscious).

Ok, finally done, this should contain all you need to craft various types of lightsabers. The only thing I can think of to extend it with is various hilt, emitter, power cell or lense types, ala KOTOR, but I think thatÂ´s too much options for the RPG.
***<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Expanded Lightsaber Content</span>***
[hide]**Lightsaber Construction**
Construcing a lightsaber is treated as a â€Moderateâ€ item for the purpose of using the Mechanics skill. This check can be used untrained by anyone with at least 7 heroic levels, as well as the Force Sensitivity and Weapon Proficiency(Lightsabers) feats. The parts needed to create a lightsaber is an activation stud plate, an emitter matrix, a handgrip, a lens assembly, a power cell, a power conduit, a recharge socket, a safety switch, and 1-3 focusing crystals. They are typically also designed with an adjuster for the blade emission, as well as a practical belt ring, although some jedi typically uses magnetical clips to attatch the weapon to their belts. All these (except the crystals) are pretty common things, but as they are rarely found together, a character who uses the Scavenger feat to search for parts when constructing a lightsaber takes a -5 penalty to his Perception check to use the feat.
A lightsaber may be constucted with anywhere between 1 and 3 focusing crystals, but crafting a lightsaber with more than one crystal is a very complex task. A specific case of this is the multi-phase lightsaber, designed to be able to shift between different focuses in the saber, in order to vary the length of the blade to confuse and suprise an opponent. When shifting a phase, a different crystal will be used as the primary focus of the saber, switching the blade length. A blade can possess up to three different lengths (1 per each crystal it contains), and switching between them is a Swift action that grants a +5 circumstance bonus to feinting in combat. This ability can only be used once for every new phase used against any single opponent. Switching phase also changes the primary focus of the lightsaber, and thus any bonus gained from a specific lightsaber crystal is changed. Constructing a multi-phase saber increases the DC by 5 for every additional crystal used.
A lightsaber can also be crafted to use multiple crystal as focuses at the same time. This allows a characte to take advantage of the bonuses from up to three lightsaber crystals at the same time, but involves a very complex construction. Constructing a saber woth multiple focuses increases the DC by 10 for every additional crystal used.
In any type of lightsaber, you can replace the crystals in the saber, but you will need to break down the saber and rebuild it again. However, when doing this, you can automatically consider yourself to have both â€detailed knowledge of specific itemâ€ and â€detailed schematics availableâ€. You will need to spend new Force Points to attune the saber to you again though. Also, a lightsaber designed to house three crystals at once, will reqire more space in order to do so, and will be treated as a Large-sized item for all purposes (typically known as a Great Lightsaber or â€Lightclubâ€), and can be designed to have a blade length of up to 3 meters, and can thus possibly grant the wielder of the saber reach (1 square). Most common lightsabers contains one or two crystals though.
After all the parts are assembled, the character may begin construction of his lightsaber. If he wishes, he may enter a meditative state before he begins the construction. This is done by suceeding on a DC 25 Use the Force/Force Skill check, and if sucessfull grants him a +10 bonus to his Mechanics checks to complete the lightsaber as long as he remains in that state. If any one Mechanics check in the crafting process should fail by 5 or more, the lightsaber will have a flaw in it, and will short out and become unusable whenever a character rolls a natural 1 on any d20 check made to use the lightsaber (Attack rolls, Block/Deflect rolls, etc). Should 2 or more checks fail by 5 or more, the flaw will be critical, and the weapon will malfunction the first time it is lit.
**Lightsaber Crystals**
The focusing crystal is the most important and complex part of the lightsaber. While all the other components are quite common electronical devices, the crystals cannot just be any kind of crystalline object. Ultimately, they should be something that reflects back on the person crafting the saber, and have some special, individual meaning for him.
While some types of crystals tend to more commonly have abilities suited towards using them in a lightsaber, far from all such crystals holds those abilities. In order to find a crystal that is useable, a character must spend time searching for it, and most oftenly it will be the Force who guides him to the crystal. Off course, if he finds a crystal that has been proven useful (one that is already in a lightsaber, or one of the well-known unique crystals, or something similar), he can always use that. Or, in the spirit of the Sith, he may also craft his own synthetic crystal.
Finding a useful crystal requires that you first finds a suitable spot where available crystals can be found. Some such sites are well-known, such as the caves on Ilum, or a similar cave on Dantooine during the days of the Old Republic. Others are more unknown of, even though some crystals are known for other uses, like Stygium or Upari crystals. To find a suitable place, you must make a Knowledge(Galactic Lore) check. If you succeeds, you will learn of places that are suitable for finding lightsaber crystals in. If you succeeds at a DC 15 check, you will learn about a place where suitable crystals can be found, most likely Ilum or Dantooine (Gms discretion). If you succeds at a DC 20 check, you will gain more extensive information about where to find crystals, and you will gain a +5 bonus to checks made in the next step of your search. If you succeeds at a DC 30 check, you will have found out about all there is to know about where to find crystals, and you gains a +10 bonus to checks made in the next step of your search. The following are examples of circumstances that could modify the DC:
[ul]
[*]Lower the DC by 5 if you spends a day studying the Jedi Archives (or equal database). If you do, you also gain a +10 to checks made in the next step, if you travel to Ilum.  
[*]Increase the DC by 10 during the era of Palpatines reign, as he actively tried to supress all information regarding Jedi, lightsaber, and relatd things.  
[*]Increase the DC by 5 during the New Jedi Order era and forward, as much knowledge has been lost. [/ul]  
Of course, the GM can just skip the check if special circumstances are in play, such as a padawan being taken to Ilum by his master to construct his lightsaber. Once a suitable place has been found, proceed to the next step.
Once you have reached the location, you may begin your search. This is done by making a Use the Force/Sense check to Sense Force. The base DC for the check is 20, but the GM should feel free to add +5 or +10 to the DC if he feels the crystal is very rare (steps of 20, 25 and 30 are very suitable for the different kinds of Adegan crystals for example). Each check represents one day of searching. A character trained in Knowledge(Physical Sciences) is considered to have favorable circumstances on his checks, due to his deeper knowledge of the crystalline structure required. Some crystals are beyond the reach of these methods of finding though, such as the legendary Mantle of the Force and the Heart of the Guardian.
As a last option, a character may choose to create a synthetic crystal. Doing so is considered to be crafting a Moderate item for the purpose of using the Mechanics skill, although some rare crystals whose origins are a mystery (Phond, Sapith or Lorridian Gemstones for example) are treated as Complex items. Some special crystals cannot be synthesized, for example the rare Quixoni crystals (well, unless you manages to synthesize the supernova that created them as well), or any crystal that is known to be unique. Also, a synthetic crystal will never fully be as good in a lightsaber as a naturally formed one, and any lightsaber using a synthesized crystal takes a -1 penalty to damage rolls. The average cost for a crystals materials should be somewhere around 500 credits, and the crystal is treated as having 50 Hp for the purpose of crafting.
Below follows a list of known lightsaber crystals, their effects, where they can typically be found, and their natural coloring:
**Adegan Crystal** â€“ The most common crystal, the Adegan crystals comes in different variants: Kathracite, Danite, Relacite, Mephite and Pontite. The first three are the most common variations, however, they lack the necessary properties to form a fully perfected lightsaber blade. A lightsaber that uses one of these crystals has a damage dice of one size smaller than normal. The Mephite are the most commonly used crystals by the Jedi, and they does not alter the properties of the blade at all. Pontite crystals are rare, but they are a near-perfect focus for a lightsaber blade. A lightsaber built with a pontite crystal has a damage dice of one size larger than normal. A character who crafts his own lightsaber using any type of Adegan crystal gains a +1 crystal bonus when using the lightsaber.
**Where:** Primarily the Adega system and the planet Ilum **Colors:** Primarily blue and green
**Bondar Crystal** â€“ Bondar crystals alters the properties of a lightsabers blade, and creates a duller, not quite as focused energy blade as many other crystals. A lightsaber built with a bondar crystal deals stun damage to an opponent, instead of normal damage, and is thus perfect for training sabers.
**Where:** An asteroid in far orbit around Alderaan **Colors:** Primarily Yellow, Green and Blue
**Firkrann/Luxum Crystal** â€“ These two crystals gives the blade of a lightsaber an electrical charge, turning it into a energy beam of low threat to a normal living being, but instead it emitts a powerful ion charge that can be devastating to droids, cyborgs and veichles. I lightsaber built with a Firkrann or Luxum crystal deals ion damage, and the Firkrann crystal also grants a +2 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Firkrann crystals are mined on the desert planet of Rafa V, and Luxum crystals are constructed through extensive meditation in the dark energies of Lake Natth on the planet Ambria **Colors:** Pimarily White and Light Blue
**Opila** â€“ The Opila crystal provides an excellent focus for a lightsaber blade, generating a more focused and intense blade, increasing the weapons ability to cut through materials with ease. A lightsaber built with an Opila crystal deals an additional dice of damage on a critical hit (applied after the damage multiplier), and also adds +2 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Mined in the asteroid field in the Fyrth system **Colors:** Pimarily Dark Blue and Violet
**Jenraux** â€“ By refining the Opila crystal, cleaning it of any impurities, the Jenraux crystal is produced. This crystal can create a slightly wider energy blade, making it easier to intercept projectiles. A lightsaber built with a Jenraux crystal gives its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to all Use the Force/Control checks to use the Deflect talent, as well as a +1 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Created by refining Opila crystals **Colors:** Pimarily Blue, Orange or Yellow
**Phond** â€“ Phond crystals possesses highly rare structures and consistency, and can be used to create a more fiercely burning lighsaber blade, that is harder to stop. A lightsaber built with a Phond crystal may deal only slashing damage instead of energy/slashing on any attack.
**Where:** Created as a byproduct when making alloys, reasons and circumstances yet unknown **Colors:** Pimarily Red, Orange and Bronze
**Rubat** â€“ A Rubat crystal holds a lot of qualities making it suitable for useage in a lightsaber. It creates a more well-defined blade than other crystals, allowing the wielder to track its movements more easily, thus allowing for greater control of the blade. A lightsaber built with a Rubat crystal grants its wielder a +1 crystal bonus to all attack and damage rolls when using the weapon.
**Where:** The planet Phemis **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow, Orange
**Sigil** â€“ When inserted into a lightsaber, a Sigil crystal produces a searing effect on the blade, greatly increasing its damage output. A lightsaber built with a Sigil crystal increaes the size of its damage dice by 1 step, and also adds a +1 crystal bonus to all damage rolls.
**Where:** Mined expensively in the Sigil system **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow, Bronze
**Solari** â€“ The Solari crystal is a unique lightsaber crystal, strongly attuned to the Light Side of the Force, and greatly increased the atuunement to the living Force of anyone who bonded used it. It requires a wielder to be pure of heart and soul, otherwise it will not allow a user to tap into its powers. A lightsaber built with the Solari crystal grants its wielder +3 crystal bonus to all attack and damage rolls when using the lightsaber, as well as a +5 crystal bonus when using the *Rebuke*/*Force Defense* Force Power against a Force Power with the [Dark Side] descriptor. If the wielder has a Dark Side Score greater than 0, he cannot tap into the power of the crystal, and looses all its bonuses until he reddems himself.
**Where:** Last found by Revan on Korriban, but no one knows where it is now **Colors:** Brilliantly shining light orange
**Upari** â€“ Upari crystal have been used by the wookies on Kashyyk as jewelry for a long time. The crystal is brittle, but some are capable enough to be used as focuses in lightsabers. Through various ways of cutting the crystal, and the Force, Jedi Masters have been known to utilize these crystals to create a variety of effects. A lightsaber built with a Upari crystal produces one of the following effects (permanently chosen at time of construction): +1 to all attack rolls, +2 crystal bonus to all damage rolls, +2 crystal bonus to Use the Force/Control checks to use the Deflect talent, +2 crystal bonus to Use the Force/Control checks to use the Block talent or a +1 dodge bonus to Reflex Defense when using the Lightsaber Defense talent.
**Where:** Orbit around forest worlds like Kashyyk **Colors:** Pimarily Light Blue, Turquoise
**Eralam** â€“ Eralam crystals are built in a way that fulfills nearly all the wishes for a lightsaber crystal, and can produce a clear and stable blade. A lightsabr built using a Eralam crystal adds +1 crystal bonus to all attack rolls and a +2 to all damage rolls made using the lightsaber.
**Where:** Third moon of Erai, but were made scarce when the Sith bombarded the planet **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow, Orange
**Sapith** â€“ Sapith crystals generates a very focused lightsaber blade, and one that is very easy to handle, even for an unskilled user. A lightsaber built with a Sapith crystal grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to all attack rolls using the lightsaber.
**Where:** Excrement from the now-extinct Volice worm, living on Lwhekk **Colors:** Pimarily White, Green
**Damind** â€“ Damind crystal can alter the length of a lightsaber blade, making it slightly longer than the average blade, thus making it easier to reach an opponent in battle. The blade would also widen slightly, allowing a wielder better protection against incoming projectiles. A lightsaber built with a Damind crystal grants its wielder a +1 crystal bonus to all attack rolls when using the lightsaber, as well as a +1 crystal bonus to all Use the Force/Control checks to use the Deflect talent.
**Where:** The planet of Daminia **Colors:** Pimarily Purple, Violet, Red
**Nextor** â€“ Whe inserted into a lightsaber, Nextor crystal generates a highly volatile blade, but still manages to keep it stable. This leads to a weapon that can inflict terrible amounts of damage, but that is somewhat unstable in its effects. A lightsaber built with a Nextor crystal increases its threat range by 1 (a natural 19 is not an automatic hit though), but a user takes a -2 penalty to all attack rolls made using the weapon.
**Where:** The mountains of MÂ´haeli **Colors:** Pimarily Blue, White
**Dragite** â€“ Dragite crystals are perhaps not meant to be used in a lightsaber, but the properties they creates are most interesting indeed. Upon contact, these crystals created a loud resonance, something that can sear an opponent, but also allowed a Jedi to use it against the normally undeflectable sonic weapons. A lightsaber built with a Dragite crystal adds +1 sonic damage to all attack rolls (will be inflicted even if the attack is stopped using the Block talent), and also allows the wielder to use the Deflect (not Redirect Shot) talent against weapons that deals sonic damage, but they takes a -10 penalty to their Use the Force/Control checks when doing so.
**Where:** The mountains of MÂ´haeli**Colors:** Pimarily Violet
**Kasha** â€“ Kasha crystals have traditionally been used as meditation tools by Cereans, inscribing patterns on each face of the crystal, using them to clear ones mind for meditation. When inserted into a lightsaber, it has no specific effect on the blades properties, but for one attuned to the crystal, its meditative and soothing abilities can be felt even in the heat of battle. A lightsaber built with a Kasha crystal grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to his Will Defense, and allows him to reroll one of the bonus dice gained from spending a Force Point when using it on an attack roll, and take the better result.
**Where:** Crafted by the Cerans **Colors:** Pimarily White
**Qixoni** â€“ Qixoni crystals are extreemly rare, and they have been heavily exposed to the Dark Side of the Force, making them a most useful tool to channel the power of ones anger and hate through. A lightsaber built with a Qixoni crystal grants its wielder a crystal bonus to all damage rolls equal to half his Dark Side Score.
**Where:** Only a few exists, they were formed in a supernova of an unknown star **Colors:** Dark Red
**Lorrdian Gemstone** â€“ Lorrdian Gemstones has been imbued with some degree of kinetic communication, allowing a wielder to better predict the actions of others. A lightsaber built using a Lorrdian Gemstone grants its wielder a +2 crystal bonus to Use the Force/Control check to use the Deflect and Block talents.
**Where:** Created during the Kanz disorders, no one knows where (or if) any remains **Colors:** Pimarily Violet, Purple
**Velmorite** â€“ Velmorite crystals are typically used to craft fine energy swords, and such properties seems to translate well into a lightsaber blade. Such a lightsabers blade tends to be slimmer and finer than others, creating a blade that can be wielded with grace and skill. A lightsaber built with a Velmorite crystal adds +1 to the dodge bonus given by the Lightsaber Defense talent, and also adds a +1 crystal bonus to attack rolls if the lightsaber is used with the Weapon Finesse feat.
**Where:** The planet Velmor **Colors:** Pimarily Yellow
**Barab Ore Ignot** â€“ Barab Ore has been exposed to high levels of radiation, and when used in a lightsaber, it creates a fiercly burning blade, almost impossible to control. A lightsaber built with a Barab Ore Ignot adds fire to its damage type, in addition to energy and slashing.
**Where:** Mined on the surface of Barab I **Colors:** Pimarily Gray, Black
**Stygium** â€“ The Stygium mineral is widely known for its use in advanced stealth field generators, especially in starships. However, these crystals also possesses the necessary characteristics to function as the focus in a lightsaber.
