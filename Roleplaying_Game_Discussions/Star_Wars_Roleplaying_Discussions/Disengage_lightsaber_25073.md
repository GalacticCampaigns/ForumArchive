# Disengage lightsaber

### **jaybee3** (2011-07-22 17:54:15)

Having just watched the latest series of Clone Wars, I was interested by the force users on Mortis. One of them disengages the lightsabers of Ani, Obi and Asohka. I was wondering what this would translate to in the rpg world?

Having not watched the latest Clone Wars stuff (still have to will myself to look at that awful graphic style), IÂ´m not sure exactly what you mean by "disengage", so if you could be a bit more specific, that would help.

Disengage as in turns them off?

Haven't seen the episode but maybe it could have been the drain energy power on the lightsabers energy cell.

A powerful force user holds his hand up and it puts out/turns off the lightsabers of the guys trying to attack him in an instant. I'll try and find a vid of it. Perhaps telekinesis to disrupt/destroy the inner workings of the weapon or (de-)activate the deadman switch? If it is telekinesis, how easy/difficult is it to resist on something you're holding?

Given that description I would second Yogis suggestion that it is Drain Energy, found in the *Jedi Academy Training Manual*.
If you are looking for some telekinetic solution, I would say Force Grip sounds closest.
