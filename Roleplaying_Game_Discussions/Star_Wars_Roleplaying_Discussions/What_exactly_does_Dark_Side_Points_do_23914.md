# What exactly does Dark Side Points do?

In d6 Star Wars, when you got a Dark Side point, it allowed you to add an additional d6 to whatever Force you were making. If you took this offered bonus, the GM was encouraged to screw with you, tempting you further into the Dark Side, until you went to Team Evil.
Once you get your jersey, (I think) you lose this bonus. Since the recruitment phase is done, the Dark Side isn't all that interested in giving you that boost.
Gaining a Dark Side points in RCR just showed how evil you are. It looks about the same in Saga.
All editions allow certain powers based on whether or not you have Dark Side points (Dark Side Powers, Light Side Powers) or if you have so many (can't use this power is you have over five Dark Side points.
My question is if you are already a Dark Sider, does again yet another Dark Side point matter? Do you need to keep doing Bad Things (tm) to keep you Evil Club Card? Are their levels of being a Bad Dude? Or is it that once you crossed the line, you're just evil?

Well. Re-reading the section.
You can have a max number of dark side points equal to your wisdom.
If your dark side score equals your wisdom, your considered a Darksider and your character becomes an NPC (unless the GM decides otherwise)

To further clarify, even if you have a Dark Side Score equal to your Wisdom score, you can still use abilities and take actions that would gain you more Dark Side Score, but at this point itÂ´s not worth keeping track of anymore.
