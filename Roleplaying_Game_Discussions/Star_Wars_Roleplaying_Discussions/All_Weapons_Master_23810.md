# All Weapons Master???

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-03-04 17:47:06)

I was laying out plans for my Republic Commando character, and I realized something that is pretty nice. Using the Stripping Weapons option from S&V, an Elite Trooper with the Exotic Weapons Master talent can in fact make himself proficient with any weapon, even Heavy Weapons, Lightsabers and Advanced Melee weapons (which are the groups he might most often lack proficiency in) simply by using the option to strip the weapon and make it an exotic weapon. And, he also gains a free upgrade slot as part of the deal.
Thoughts??

I think that would work nicely. It still requires some work on the character's part, so you can't just pick up a lightsaber from a dead Jedi and automatically be able to use it. It makes the Exotic Weapons Master talent so much more useful than it already was.

Wow. That's very interesting. It assumes that you have the Mechanics to strip the weapon yourself, and that requires time and tools, but still I don't see a flaw in your logic.

Yeah someone was talking about this on the Wizards' forums the other day. If you really want to optimize using any weapon the Gladiator's Exotic Weapons Master talent lets you treat all exotic weapons as one weapon group. That way you can take Weapon Focus(Exotic) or Multiattack(Exotic) and the like.

ThatÂ´s nice, I hadnÂ´t even thought of using the Gladiator that way. I was looking over taking this talent to make use of all kinds of strange exotic weapons we might pick up during the game, and just noticed it had other uses as well.
At first, I thought it made little sense flavor-wise, but after thinking some more about it, it makes good sense.

I kill the first one with my blaster.
I kill the second one with my laser sword.
The next one I kill with the corpse of the first one I killed.
The fourth one I kill using this refresher sink...

Love it!
Also, Darth Anthrax, this is a beautiful method! I'd wondered how a soldier could become the weapons master. And here it is!

"Tea cup."
"What?"
"I said I was going to kill you with my tea cup."

That is awesome. Combine this with a soldier talent from Scum and Villainy(can't remeber the name) that lets you use improvised weapons at no penalty, and you've definitly got someone who could kill you with just about *anything*.
