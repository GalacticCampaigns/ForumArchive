# Star Wars in Fate Core & Fate Accelerated

### **Sketchpad** (2013-05-29 15:25:01)

So I caved and supported the Fate Kickstarter that was going on a few months back, and got my main books for Fate Core and Fate Accelerated. As some of you may know, I've been playing around with running Star Wars using Fate rather than the systems that have typically been linked to the license for a while now (since I was looking at Starblazer Adventures). I know a few others were intrigued when I talked about in the chat room and had even gone as far as making a model for the boards.
With that said, the current version of the game is AMAZING! The system is generic and can emulate most genres, but isn't bogged down with a horde of rules which tend to slow RPing. Instead it's a bit more cinematic and puts a bit more storytelling within the players' hands and allows for those crazy stunts that Star Wars has been known for. Fate Core is the main book and weighs in at over 300 pages. It contains most of what you need, including how to make effects that emulate powers, magic, vehicles, etc. (there is also an Toolkit coming out to expand on those). Fate Accelerated, on the other hand, takes the rules and crushes them down to a 48 page book that's very basic and kind of fun to play. I ran a Cyberpunk game using it a few weeks back and it seemed well received. Both use a contribution "pay what you want" model that can be located at [The Fate Main Page](http://www.faterpg.com/ "http://www.faterpg.com/"). I've included a Fate Accelerated Edition (or FAE) of Luke Skywalker that someone posted below (with a link to the page embedded in the name). Seriously considering using this over the FFG game. Any thoughts?

Luke Skywalker from Star Wars
Using Luke as an example to illustrate character advancement in Fate Accelerated.
Let's assume that the group has roughed in the setting --- evil Empire, old Republic, Jedi Knights --- and Luke player has come up with the idea that he's a potential Jedi. Luke starts off something like this, leaving two aspects and one stunt to be decided upon in play:
High Concept: "Young Jedi in Training"
Trouble: "Inexperienced"
Other Aspects: "Grew up on a farm, eager to see the galaxy", plus two more aspects to be decided on in play
Approaches: Careful+0, Clever+1, Flashy+1, Forceful+2, Quick+3, Sneaky+2
Stunt: Because I Have Quick Reflexes, I get a +2 when I quickly overcome an obstacle while driving my landspeeder.
Stunt: Because I Don't Look Dangerous, I get a +2 when I sneakily overcome an obstacle by avoiding authority figures.
Stunt: Decide on one more stunt in play
Refresh: 3
1st session --- Star Wars
Over the course of the first session, Luke's player fills in his missing aspects and stunts:
High Concept: "Young Jedi in Training"
Trouble: "Inexperienced"
Other Aspects: "Grew up on a farm, eager to see the galaxy"; "Old Ben won't steer me wrong"; "The Empire killed my aunt and uncle"
Approaches: Careful+0, Clever+1, Flashy+1, Forceful+2, Quick+3, Sneaky+2
Stunt: Because I Have Quick Reflexes, I get a +2 when I quickly overcome an obstacle while driving my landspeeder.
Stunt: Because I Don't Look Dangerous, I get a +2 when I sneakily overcome an obstacle by avoiding authority figures.
Stunt: Because I Have a Lightsaber, I get a +2 when I forcefully attack in hand-to-hand combat.
Refresh: 3
The first session covers everyone meeting, a few quick combat scenes to get everyone used to the mechanics, and getting off Tatooine. That's a minor milestone. Luke's player realizes he isn't going to get any more use out of that landspeeder stunt, and swaps it for something more useful in space combat:
Stunt: Because I Used to Bull's-Eye Womp Rats in My T-16, I get a +2 when I quickly attack using a vehicle's guns.
2nd session
The second session covers rescuing Leia from the Death Star. Luke uses his "Don't Look Dangerous" stunt when sneaking around --- he avoids talking to higher-ups when disguised as a stormtrooper. The end of the session brings a minor milestone, and Luke's player decides he wants to avoid getting shot at more than avoiding getting noticed, so he changes "Don't Look Dangerous" for:
Stunt: Because The Force Guides My Movements, I get a +2 when I quickly defend by dodging distance attacks.
3rd session
That new stunt comes in handy for dodging TIE-fighter blasts during the third session, which features the assault on the Death Star. That ends the first movie, a significant milestone.
Luke's player bumps Luke's forceful bonus to +3. He also changes "Grew up on a farm, eager to see the galaxy" to "Eager to master the Force". (He keeps "Old Ben won't steer me wrong" around for Ben's force ghost.)
4th session --- The Empire Strikes Back
Luke now looks like this:
High Concept: "Young Jedi in Training"
Trouble: "Inexperienced"
Other Aspects: "Old Ben won't steer me wrong"; "Eager to master the Force"; "The Empire killed my aunt and uncle"
Approaches: Careful+0, Clever+1, Flashy+1, Forceful+3, Quick+3, Sneaky+2
Stunt: Because I Used to Bull's-Eye Womp Rats in My T-16, I get a +2 when I quickly attack using a vehicle's guns.
Stunt: Because The Force Guides My Movements, I get a +2 when I quickly defend by dodging distance attacks.
Stunt: Because I Have a Lightsaber, I get a +2 when I forcefully attack in hand-to-hand combat.
Refresh: 3
The GM takes Luke's new aspect as a hint to invent a new teacher character, so the first session has Luke training with Yoda. At the end of that session (minor milestone), Luke's learned a bit of caution, so he swaps the bonuses for flashy and careful:
Approaches: Careful+1, Clever+1, Flashy+0, Forceful+3, Quick+3, Sneaky+2
5th session
Luke's training continues. The session ends with him leaving for Bespin. Minor milestone, so he swaps out "Used to Bull's-Eye Womp Rats in My T-16" to take a stunt for Force telekinesis:
Because I have Telekinesis, I get a +2 when I forcefully create an advantage by moving things with my will.
6th session
The fight with Vader on Bespin. Luke takes a severe consequence ("Hand cut off"), but negotiates a concession out of the GM that keeps Vader from capturing him. The PCs escape (except for Solo), and that's the end of the movie, and another significant milestone.
Luke's player bumps careful up one, to +2. And he changes another aspect, dropping the one about Ben in favor of "Darth Vader is my father". And the GM allows him to change his "Hand cut off" consequence for "Bionic hand". It's still hanging around as a consequence, though, because he hasn't had it for two sessions.
7th session --- Return of the Jedi
Here's Luke at the opening of Jedi. He doesn't have stunts to represent the Jedi Mind Trick; he can just do that, based on his aspects. You'll notice that the Jedi Mind Trick doesn't work on Jabba the Hutt; maybe it would have if Luke's player had bought a stunt for it!
High Concept: "Young Jedi in Training"
Trouble: "Inexperienced"
Other Aspects: "Darth Vader is my father"; "Eager to master the Force"; "The Empire killed my aunt and uncle"
Consequences: "Bionic hand" (severe)
Approaches: Careful+2, Clever+1, Flashy+0, Forceful+3, Quick+3, Sneaky+2
Because I have Telekinesis, I get a +2 when I forcefully create an advantage by moving things with my will.
Stunt: Because The Force Guides My Movements, I get a +2 when I quickly defend by dodging distance attacks.
Stunt: Because I Have a Lightsaber, I get a +2 when I forcefully attack in hand-to-hand combat.
Refresh: 3
Rescuing Han Solo from Jabba is the seventh session; that's another minor milestone. Luke changes "Eager to master the Force" to "I am worthy of the title of Jedi", but he can't change his High Concept yet. (Also, that thing about worthiness seems nicely compellable, don't you think?)
8th session
The eighth session is meeting up with the Ewoks. Everyone hates this session. Still, finishing it is a minor milestone. Luke's player is already planning to take the fight to Vader, so he spends a point of refresh on a new stunt:
Stunt: Because The Force Runs Strong in My Family, I get a +2 when I forcefully defend myself from relatives.
Refresh: 2
9th session
Luke's given himself +2 bonuses on three of the four actions taken with the forceful approach. Pretty handy, but it won't help him against Palpatine's force lightning! He also needs to accept a compel early on to compensate for his lowered refresh.
The end of Jedi is a major milestone. Luke changes his Trouble and one of his other aspects, clears his severe consequence, raises his forceful to +4, gets a point of refresh, and changes his High Concept, becoming a real Jedi at last:
High Concept: "First of a new line of Jedi Knights"
Trouble: "New responsibilities"
Other Aspects: "Darth Vader is my father"; "I am worthy of the title of Jedi"; "My friends are a source of strength"
Approaches: Careful+2, Clever+1, Flashy+0, Forceful+4, Quick+3, Sneaky+2
Because I have Telekinesis, I get a +2 when I forcefully create an advantage by moving things with my will.
Stunt: Because The Force Guides My Movements, I get a +2 when I quickly defend by dodging distance attacks.
Stunt: Because I Have a Lightsaber, I get a +2 when I forcefully attack in hand-to-hand combat.
Stunt: Because The Force Runs Strong in My Family, I get a +2 when I forcefully defend myself from relatives.
Refresh: 3
