# Expanded Lightsaber Content

### **Thraken** (2008-10-21 08:22:13)

Since there's no objection on the other thread (hopefully not because no one reads this section anymore) I hereby submit the stuff I have come up with and converted for you all to rip to shreds <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> .
<strong>(Corrected) Alternate Lightsaber Crystals</strong>
Given that there appears to be no logic or reason behind the random assigning of lightsaber crystals names or effects, I have rearranged their some of their effects as well as adding different effects that sources have shown. For all new content I have tried to keep in line with the level of effects seen throughout SWSE. Fluff text can be found in wookieepedia, [GB Kotor 2](http://www.gamebanshee.com/cgi-bin/search/banshee_search.pl?_layout=KotOR2_Items&_cgifunction=search&KotOR_Items.game=KOTOR2&KotOR_Items.category=Lightsaber+Upgrade&KotOR_Items.type=Power+Crystal "http://www.gamebanshee.com/cgi-bin/search/banshee_search.pl?_layout=KotOR2_Items&_cgifunction=search&KotOR_Items.game=KOTOR2&KotOR_Items.category=Lightsaber+Upgrade&KotOR_Items.type=Power+Crystal"), [GB Kotor](http://www.gamebanshee.com/cgi-bin/search/banshee_search.pl?_layout=KotOR1_Items&_cgifunction=search&KotOR_Items.game=KOTOR1&KotOR_Items.category=Lightsaber+Upgrade&KotOR_Items.type=Power+Crystal "http://www.gamebanshee.com/cgi-bin/search/banshee_search.pl?_layout=KotOR1_Items&_cgifunction=search&KotOR_Items.game=KOTOR1&KotOR_Items.category=Lightsaber+Upgrade&KotOR_Items.type=Power+Crystal") and KOTOR Campaign guide.
If you only wish to 'canonically' apply the kinds of crystals named in the KOTOR campaign guide you need only read this post. Afterwards are my conversions and own ideas.
A crystal listed as having more than one effect may only impart one effect to the lightsaber, chosen when spending an FP to attune the lightsaber. Bonuses to attack stack with the +1 personal attack bonus.
> **Bondar** Found on an asteroid in the Alderaan system. The crystal is clear with a reddish impurities.
> As KOTORCG
> **Firkrann** Collected by natives on on Rafa V (primitive world). The crystal is dense and a silvery-white colour
> Ion Damage only
> Deals an extra die of damage against SR
> Personal Bonus to attack +1
> **Luxum** Can be produced from Lake Natth on Ambria after long meditation (primitive world). The crystal is clear with pale blue tinge
> Ion Damage only
> Deals an extra die of damage against SR
> **Opila**  Found in asteroid fields in Fyrth System. The crystal is a dark blue or violet colour.
> Add an extra die of damage to total damage rolled from a critical hit

> **Upari**  Found in orbit of forest worlds. The crystal is a sky blue or turquoise colour.
> Once per encounter you may reroll damage and take the better result
> Personal attack bonus +1 and stacks with modifications
> **Phond** Alloy making byproduct. Formation is by random and unknown process. The clear crystals have reddish impurities.
> Once per encounter you may reroll damage and take the better result
> **Sigil**  Mined in Sigil system. The clear crystals can have orange impurities
> Once per encounter you may reroll damage and take the better result
> Retains personal attack bonus and stacks with modifications
> **Eralam** Mined on Third moon of Erai. The crystals possess a pale yellow-orange colour
> Bonus to damage +2
> Personal Bonus to attack +1
> **Sapith** Excretion of extinct creature from Lwhekk. The crystal is a silvery-white colour
> Bonus to damage +2 and can stack with equipment bonus from personalised modifications and/or tech specialist
> Personal Bonus to attack +1
> **Rubat**  Mined on Phemis. The Crystals possess a pale yellow-orange colour
> Allows damage bonuses from modifications to stack
> Retains personal attack bonus and can stack with modifications
> **Solari**  Rarely seen on Sacorria. The Crystal is clear and orange in colour
> Bonus to damage +2
> Deals an extra die of damage against creatures with DS score of 1 or higher (saga-edition.com)
> Personal attack bonus +1 and stacks with modifications
> Special: If the DS Score of the wielder increases over 0, the lightsaber shuts down and canâ€™t be reignited, unless the wielder atones or replaces the crystal. (saga-edition.com)
> **Jenruax** Refined Opila. The crystal has an unusual appearance and may be pale blue or orange.
> Bonus to deflect +2
> Bonus to damage +2
> **Damind** Found in the deserts of Daminia. The Crystal is clear and possesses an amethyst like purple colour.
> Personal bonus to attack +1 and stacks with modifications
> **Nextor** Found in the mountains of M&#39;haeli. It is a silvery blue or violet colour
> Once per encounter you may extend the threat range of your attack by one as a free action. This stacks with other abilities that extend threat range, however only 20 is regarded as an automatic hit.
> Retains personal attack bonus and can stack with modifications

Note that all are rare and often only discovered in a single place in the galaxy, whereas normal lightsaber crystals can be found at various places throughout the galaxy
Beyond this point are my ideas for covering a large number of the lightsaber arrangements seen in various sources.

<strong>Conversion: WotC Lightsaber Quest</strong> ([Jedi Counseling 69](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=swminis/article/jedicounseling69 "http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=swminis/article/jedicounseling69") [&amp; 75)](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=swminis/article/jedicounseling75 "http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=swminis/article/jedicounseling75"))
These are pretty much straight conversions from the old SWRCR jedi counseling materials. DCs have been broadly increased by 5 due to the new skill system. Damage comes from the official conversion rules.
> **Adegan Crystals wrote:**
>
> Kathracite and Relacite crystals are most common but produce a diffuse lightsaber blade (1 step lower damage die). These are often used as secondary focusing crystals.
> Mephite crystals are widely regarded as ideal for lightsaber construction. Danite crystals also produce good blades but are not as efficient as Mephite
> Pontite crystals are very rare but produce very intense lightsaber blades (1 step higher damage die). These are so rare that those who search for such crystals are equally as rare. Those who do come across them accept it as a gift from the force.
> Note that other sufficiently high quality crystals have also been used as lightsaber blades. They should be as high quality as Danite or Mephite. Presumably the Jedi Order has favored Adegan Crystals due to their force sensitivity and difficulty in getting them

> **Synthetic Adegan Crystals wrote:**
>
> Synthetic crystals have typically been used by the sith, though Jedi after the defeat of the Emperor have taken up the practice due to the difficulty in finding lightsaber crystals.
> Synthetically growing a lightsaber crystal requires a Mechanics check and raw materials given as credit price. This check may be made untrained if a character trained in mechanics assists you, but other characters may not use aid another on you.
> Synthetic kathracite, relacite and danite crystals are all of lower quality and thus produce lightsabers with one step lower damage die than normal. Synthetic Mephite and Pontite however are suitable for standard lightsabers.
> You may gain a +5 bonus to the check if you spend a day studying lightsaber crystals and construction from a suitable source
> Subtract -10 from the DC for a tiny lightsaber crystal.
> Subtract â€“5 from the DC for a short lightsaber&#39;s crystal. These require smaller crystals
> Add +5 to the DC for a great lightsaber&#39;s crystal (or the second crystal for a dual-phase lightsaber or a continual focus crystal). It&#39;s harder to make crystals for focusing a longer blade.
> Add +10 to the DC for a &quot;heavy lightsaber&quot; crystal (Large, 2d10 damage, 1.8 kg, otherwise the same as a normal lightsaber). These are much larger and difficult produce in sufficient quality.
> kathracite (DC 15, 100 credits)
> relacite (DC 20, 200 credits)
> danite (DC 25, 300 credits)
> mephite (DC 30, 400 credits)
> pontite (DC 35, 500 credits)

> **Searching for Adegan crystals wrote:**
>
> The PC should make a Knowledge (Galactic lore) check to see if he knows of a good place to conduct his search. He may take 10 but can&#39;t take 20, and can&#39;t retry until you gain at least one more level. Optionally, you may skip this step if the PC&#39;s Jedi master takes him to a specific location, such as the sanctuary on Ilum (an &quot;exceptional&quot; site prior to its destruction during the Clone Wars).
> Add a +5 equipment bonus to your Knowledge (Galactic lore) check if you spend one day studying the archives of the Jedi Temple immediately before you make the check. (This does not stack with the bonus from a datapad, if applicable.)
> Add +10 to the DC during the reign of the Empire. Palpatine actively suppressed information related to the Jedi order.
> Add +5 to the DC during the New Republic era. Although the Empire could no longer actively suppress this information, Luke Skywalker and the earliest members of the New Jedi Order had only just begun to reconstruct the lost knowledge.
> Result Effect
> 14 or less No suitable site found.
> 15-19 Marginal site found: Add +10 to See Force check DC
> 20-24 Acceptable site found: Add +5 to See Force check DC
> 24 or more Exceptional site found: Use listed See Force check DC
> Next, the PC has to travel to the appropriate world (Ilum, Ossus in the Adegan system, and so on) and then conduct the actual search itself. Given the fact that the best lightsaber crystals are those that naturally resonate in the Force, this search is resolved with a Use the Force check. Each check represents about one day of searching. You can take 10 on this check, but you can&#39;t take 20. However, you may retry as many times as you wish.
> Result Effect
> 14 or less   None
> 15-19 Kathracite
> 19-24 Relacite
> 25-29 Danite
> 30-34 Mephite
> 35 or more   Pontite
> Modifiers:
> Subtract -10 from the DC for a tiny lightsaber crystal.
> Subtract â€“5 from the DC for a short lightsaber&#39;s crystal. These require smaller crystals that are somewhat easier to find.
> Add +5 to the DC for a great lightsaber&#39;s crystal (or the second crystal for a dual-phase lightsaber or a continual focus crystal). It&#39;s slightly harder to find crystals that are ideal for focusing the longer blade.
> Add +10 to the DC for a &quot;heavy lightsaber&quot; crystal (Large, 2d10 damage, 1.8 kg, otherwise the same as a normal lightsaber). These are much larger and extremely rare.

<strong>Lightsaber construction</strong>
These are based off the item construction rules within the Force Unleashed. The way I have set it up, it is basically an extended and expanded version of the DC20 UtF from SWSE that may be a better fit if used within a campaign.
> Lightsaber construction is often a unique experience. One Jedi may find all the parts he needs on his travels. Another may embark on a quest solely to find and build a lightsaber. Construction itself also differs from Jedi to Jedi. Often they are simply assembled. Others may embark on a force driven quest and have no distinct memory of building their lightsaber.
> **Parts**
> Generic lightsaber parts have a credit value equal to the final cost of building the lightsaber (1500 for any single blade and 3000 for a double blade).
> If scavenging parts, the perception check DC is modified by the size and quality of the site.
> Above Average Site -0
> Average Site -5
> Below Average -10
> A graveyard of hundreds of derelict starships might be an above average site, a junk yard an average site, and the debris left after a space battle would be a below average site, if the GM allows it at all. Due to the random nature of locating parts while scavenging, construction cannot begin until the full credit value has been gathered. The GM is also free to limit the number of times you can search a site. A below average site might only allow one or two check while a starship graveyard might allow for virtually unlimited scrounging.
> During a quest the character may find, steal or be rewarded with an object suitable for use as a lightsaber part. The GM should specify it&#39;s value that goes toward the construction of a lightsaber.
> **Construction**
> Constructing a Lightsaber is a &#39;Moderate Item&#39; type for construction and may be made untrained by a character with at least seven heroic levels, Lightsaber proficiency and force sensitivity. As you possess lightsaber proficiency you may apply the &quot;Based on well known&quot; item circumstance bonus. If your character also possesses two of tech specialist, lightsaber talents or lightsaber feats you may instead apply the &quot;Detailed knowledge of item&quot; circumstance bonus
> If the character is deemed to lack lightsaber knowledge he may not apply any circumstance bonus.
> If you fail a check by 5 more it will have a flaw and will stop working if you roll a Natural 1 when using the item. You can get the item working again with a repair check.
> If you fail the check by 10 or more, it has a critical flaw. Either it will automatically fail when powered up, explode first time used etc.
> You may substitute the mechanics check with a Use the Force Check.
> Once the lightsaber is constructed you must spend a force point to attune it (Full round action)

> **Crystal Mechanics wrote:**
>
> The primary crystal may be removed or returned to the lightsaber with a DC 15 Mechanics or use the force check, with the appropriate circumstance bonuses.
> This is a method of disabling a lightsaber employed by the New (and perhaps old) Jedi Order.
> If any crystals are replaced with a different crystal then perform the above check for each and once complete you may spend a force point as a full round action to attune the lightsaber and gain the benefits of the crystal.
> If one or more crystals are to be added then the modified check must be used to &#39;rebuild&#39; the lightsaber. The modified saber need only reach half HP for the additions and a Force point may be spent as a full round action to attune the lightsaber to gain its benefits.
> **Size limit**
> Due to physical size limits in a lightsaber, there are also limits on the number of crystals that may be added.
> A Standard sized lightsaber requires it&#39;s main crystal and can fit a maximum of 2 more crystals.
> A Short lightsaber requires its main crystal and can fit an extra crystal
> A Tiny lightsaber can only contain a single crystal and it&#39;s tiny size increases construction DC by 5.
> Any double bladed saber requires two sets of crystals according to the above saber classes to use.

> **Water wrote:**
>
> An active lightsaber shorts out if the emitter and blade is submerged in water. A repair check is required before the lightsaber may be used again.
> An extra lightsaber crystal must be added in compound configuration in order to allow underwater function. This is any standard lightsaber crystal and adds +5 to the construction DC as normal.

> **Non force user lightsabers wrote:**
>
> On extremely rare occasions non force sensitives have created working lightsabers. This is a trained use of the mechanics skill and requires Tech specialist. If he does not possess Lightsaber proficiency, add +5 to the DC for lightsaber construction related checks.
> A non-attuned lightsaber does not gain any special effect from its crystal, picks up a critical flaw on a roll failed by 5 or more and is considered flawed unless a natural 20 is rolled in its construction (this may be negated by any one critical flaw result) or a destiny point is spent in its construction.

<strong>Additional Crystals</strong>
While the vast majority of lightsabers throughout the ages have been single crystal models, some have created lightsabers that possess up to three crystals.  Using an alternate crystal in either configuration loses the personal attack bonus as normal unless stated or the crystal provides an attack bonus.
> **Multiphase wrote:**
>
> A simple method of using several crystals is to include mechanisms that switch out the crystal with another entirely. Thus the user may spend a swift action to switch to an alternate crystal used in its construction. This arrangement is most commonly seen in Dual-phase lightsabers. This can only be done with crystals that can generate a lightsaber blade (Alternate and standard crystals)
> **Alternate Phase Crystals**
> May be any lightsaber crystal that does not have a special effect or follows the lightsaber crystal rules. Adjusts the size class of activated lightsaber to a different size class. Available size classes are Large (2d8, reach.), medium (2d8), small (2d6) and tiny (2d4). Only one phase can be achieved per crystal and phase shift may be made as a swift action. When switching phases, each phase may be used once per encounter to provide a +5 circumstance bonus to a deception check to feint in combat. This only applies once per opponent and if he has never seen or heard it attempted before.

> **Compound focus wrote:**
>
> Possibly the most complicated arrangement ever achieved by Jedi in their lightsabers is the focusing of energy through one or more extra crystals. Here one or more secondary crystals impart an effect to the lightsaber blade at all times, however the unusual energy path does not grant a personal bonus to attack. Note that the main crystal must be a normal lightsaber crystal with no special effect.
> **Continual Focus Crystals**
> Some lightsabers have blades that can be adjusted to a variety of lengths which requires a specialised focusing crystal. The user must take a full round action to adjust the length of the blade and is considered distracted as the lightsaber cannot be used properly whilst being adjusted. A second crystal allows the same to be done as a move action and retains the personal attack bonus. This is the most common form of the three crystal lightsaber.
> Each additional crystal and associated modifications add +5 to the construction DC. If extra crystals are added to an existing standard lightsaber, it must be dismantled and rebuilt.

> **Crystals in compound configuration wrote:**
>
> **Bondar**  An asteroid in Alderaan system
> Treats a living target&#39;s damage threshold as 5 less. If brought to the end of its condition track with this weapon is considered unconscious
> **Firkrann** Found on Rafa V (primitive world)
> Half damage is considered ion damage
> Retains personal attack bonus and stacks with modifications
> **Luxum** Lake Natth, Ambria (primitive)
> Half damage is considered ion damage

> **Damind** Found on Daminia deserts
> Retains personal attack bonus and stacks with modifications
> Personal Bonus to attack +1 and stacks with modifications
> **Nextor**  Mountains of M&#39;haeli
> Once per day you may extend the threat range of your attack by one as a free action. This stacks with other abilities that extend threat range, however only 20 is regarded as an automatic hit.
> Retains personal attack bonus
> **Adegan** Any source of Adegan crystals
> Bonus to damage +2
> **Barab Ore Ingot**  Surface of barab I (Highly radioactive)
> Half is treated as fire damage, the lit lightsaber is considered a source of heat and drains power cell continuously when in active (GM discretion).
> **Dragite** D&#39;olop Mountain range, M&#39;haeli
> If damage from this weapon exceeds the target&#39;s Fortitude Defense its perception is reduced by 2 until the start of its next turn.
> **Kaiburr** From single known force artefact (The only known stash is owned by Luke Skywalker from the Rebellion the New Republic Era, By the time of NJO this is either expended or hidden away)
> Bonus to Use the Force +2 checks
> Once per encounter can regain use of a force power as a swift action
> **Kasha** Traditional Cerean Artefact
> Once per encounter can take 10 for any UtF check even when distracted
> Retains personal attack bonus
> **Violet Pontite** Most rare form of Adegan
> Half damage is considered cold damage
> Bonus +2 to persuasion checks for Adept Negotiator or Change Attitude
> **Qixoni** Planet of system destroyed in supernova
> Bonus to damage +2 and can stack with equipment bonus from personalised modifications and/or tech specialist
> Once per Encounter may regain use of a Dark Side force power as a swift action
> Special: If the DS Score of the wielder is 0, the lightsaber loses any special benefit from the crystal, unless the wielder gains more DS points
> **Ruusan** Ruusan
> Bonus to Use the Force +2 for uses listed under the skill (p77 SWSE)
> **Stygium** Stygium Crystal (mineral alone is extremely rare and expensive)
> Negates equipment bonuses to perception against the user and grants concealment vs. sensors.
> Retains personal attack bonus
> **Ultima-Pearl** Mon Cal
> Bonus to damage +2
> Personal Bonus to attack +1 and stacks with modifications
> Add an extra die of damage to total damage rolled from a critical hit
> Special: +2 to construction DC
> **Krayt Dragon pearl** Krayt Dragons, Tatooine
> Personal Bonus to attack +1 and stacks with modifications
> Half damage is considered ion damage
> **Velmorite** Velmor
> Once per day you may extend the threat range of your attack by one as a free action. This stacks with other abilities that extend threat range, however only 20 is regarded as an automatic hit.
> **Lorrdian Gemstone** Rare force imbued stone (by Lorrdian)
> Bonus to Block +2
> Bonus to deflect checks +2
> Bonus to Lightsaber Defense +1
> **Hurrikaine**  Hurikane
> Once per day you may reroll damage and take the better result. This single attack can penetrate any DR (i.e. even those listed as having resistance to lightsabers)
> (This crystal can be used as a primary lightsaber crystal, It&#39;s effect is upgraded to once per encounter and the crystals themselves are blue or violet)

> **Other wrote:**
>
> **Ankarres Sapphire**
> Once per character (including non heroic) per encounter he or she make catch a second wind as a swift action even if it is above half HP. This does not count towards a character&#39;s daily second wind limit. The sapphire must be within your square to take effect (on your person in some manner or &#39;applied&#39; by the holder). An Ankarres sapphire may be used to generate a lightsaber blade but adds no special effect.
> **Extra Crystal Chamber**
> Adds a space for an additional compound focus crystal, adding and removing a crystal from the chamber is considered replacement action.
> In a trend started by the Revanchist faction they constructed their lightsabers with extra focal positions for crystals in advance.
> With the relatively large variety of of crystals found during their roving campaigns, they were able to adapt to the many different battlefields across the galaxy
> This practice reached its peak during the Mandalorian Wars and since Malachor the method of construction was gradually lost. This current method is less efficient and much more difficult to build. The Jedi Exile was believed to be a master of this type of lightsaber construction, adding technological modifications to the lightsabers as well.

### **Thraken** (2008-10-21 08:29:26)

**Optional Rule: Saber Lock**
Lightsabers unlike almost all melee weapons in the Galaxy have a rather odd tendency to 'stick' to each other. Resisting attempts to slide the blade up or down another. This results in a relatively high frequency of saber locks in combat.
When making a standard action attack two handed, you may choose to attempt a saber lock as a swift action.
If a lightsaber attack is blocked or misses by 5 or less the saber lock begins. The opponent may choose to make an opposed Grapple roll to resist.
If the opposed roll fails, the attacker may apply any Grapple related effect or deal damage with a lightsaber.
If the opposed roll equals or exceeds the attackers roll, the lock is stalemated until their next turn and both lose their dexterity bonus to defense.
If an opposed roll exceeds the attackers roll by 5 or more then the lock is broken and the opponent may apply any Grapple related effect or deal damage with a lightsaber.
If stalemated, in the next turn of either character he may choose to ready an action to withdraw, move out of the threatened range (making you vulnerable to an attack of opportunity), use an appropriate talent, skill or force power at a -10 penalty as appropriate or take a saber lock action to attempt to overpower the opponent.
A withdrawal is only successful if the other character also chooses to withdraw in its next turn.
Special: Bonuses from lightsaber or melee defense, fighting defensively or in total defense can reduce or negate the range in which an attacker may perform a saber lock. e.g. taking a -5 atk penalty for +5 defense covers the entire 'miss by 5 or less' range. Your opponent cannot force a saber lock unless you allow it.
Riposte also allows you to choose whether or not you allow the saber lock as a result of block.
> **Optional Rule: Too big/small to handle wrote:**
>
> If the lightsaber you are using is one size category larger or two smaller than you, take a -2 penalty to block, deflect and attack rolls with it. This becomes -5 if the saber is two size categories larger than you.

> **Optional Rule: Lightsaber Mastery wrote:**
>
> [Jedi Counseling 89](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20060518jc89 "http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20060518jc89")
> The only conversions I think are needed are as follows
> &quot;For each 2 points that you sacrifice from your Heroic damage bonus, you gain one of the following benefits (your choice)&quot;
>    * &quot;Flurry: Gain one additional lightsaber attack at your highest attack bonus, but take a â€“5 penalty to all attacks made this round. (You can choose this benefit only when using the full attack action and may stack with double or triple attack.)&quot;
> The rules found here could easily be applied to other melee duels. Perhaps a requirement of an appropriate weapon related feat or talent should be used to apply for this?
