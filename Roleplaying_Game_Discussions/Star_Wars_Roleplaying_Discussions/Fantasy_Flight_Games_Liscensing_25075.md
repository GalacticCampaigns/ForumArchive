No released schedule for the RPG but I must say I'm excited. I've heard great things about their games.

Suddenly my ideas for a 4e Star Wars conversion are fading......

The first Beta was released at GenCon, reading the description and their plans for the future, I have to say that I'm a little disappointed. However, the artwork looks top-notch.

$30 for the beta version of the book! Then it's $5 for the iOS version of their dice app..... I'm already a bit disappointed. I wish they'd give a chapter or two as a demo so you can see it.
Might just end up waiting for the actual book. IDK.

I read a few pieces of info on the Wizards forums, and among the more noteworthy things it seems that the system will now be a "dice pool" system, and for some frickin reason it seems like there will be special dice made just for this game. Might make it a bit hard to take to this place in case someone wanted to try it in the future, though I suppose a custom dice roller could be coded (I could help with that).
Other than that I couldn´t make out a lot of interesting info

From what I can tell, the FFG SW game is similar to their WH/WH40K rules. Basic idea is that you choose a starting career and, as you gain experience, you move into another career (not unlike Prestige Classes). Each career allows you to specialize your character a bit more. So, for example, you might play a Scoundrel and then cross into Smuggler. The alternative dice are a bit of a pain, but there is a free sticker sheet template available on the FFG site, as well as a character sheet (which, in my honest design opinion, looks pretty clean). I've been contemplating the playtest book and may bring it up during my next game session to see if people want in. We'll see...
On that note... [waves hand] *I was never here*

Has anyone seen this: [Star Wars Edge of the Empire Beginner Game](http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=224&enmi=Star%20Wars:%20Edge%20of%20the%20Empire%20Beginner%20Game "http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=224&enmi=Star%20Wars:%20Edge%20of%20the%20Empire%20Beginner%20Game")? If it's half as good as the Pathfinderr Beginner Box, it'll be a great intro to the game.

Bought the Beta (two copies, since the old Pathfinder Beta is worn to hell and back) and have to say, this is what I was expecting and waiting for. You don't have to worry about Mr. Storm Trooper, who was a threat in Session 1 can still be a threat in Session 20.
Not too thrilled about the wounds/strain, but I'll give it a shot.
Dice pools is interesting, though I'm not a big fan of the custom dice they want people to use. Luckily, they did put in a nice chart that can be referenced. Depending on the dice in question, high is good for some and low is good for others.
Overall, I'm intrigued by it. Hopefully it'll be better when everything is said and done.

Thanks for the review! I'll probably wait till the book proper comes out.
If you get the opportunity could you do a review of some of the major differences?

### **Saronian** (2012-10-04 16:58:46)

Only real similarities between the New Star Wars and the old is that you still have different dice, Experience Points, skills, "talents" that Saga introduced, and there are still "classes". I have heard it looks alot like the D6 Star Wars from West End Games.
One thing on the classes: It goes by careers now, with 3 specializations in each career. Also, Force Users is a seperate career altogether. Initially, a force user character would be very weak in the Force but could grow more powerful. Just don't expect to be able to to Force Choke stormtroopers or throw a lightsaber around. Especially since you can't start off with one.
Everything else you can forget, since it's practically a whole new game. It is very narrative, with the GM and Players interpretting the results. Not a game that caneasily be transferred to the Play By Post that we are accutomed to. It also has a bit darker feel.
It can quickly become a Shadowrun type game where you and the group spend half the session planning for the mission. Character creation is also interesting as well.
I'll cover a bit more over the next few weeks. Is there any questions, post it right here. I'll check back in a few days.

Have to say the more I hear the more intrigued I get. I just don't think I want to shell out $30 for the unfinished product.
As for implementing it on the site there are ways where there is will and the right people.
The dice could probably be just associated with the number on the dice much like how Fudge dice are with the d6. What side dice are the 'special' dice?

I found the book at CharCon and couldn't resist buying it. For some reason actually seeing it made me feel better in buying it.
So far I've just glanced through it, but I am seeing possibilities in introducing it on the forum for play. There's actually a table for using regular dice and I was correct in thinking that the numbers on the sides can represent the ones on the special dice. It would just take some getting used to and some referencing I think.
All types of dice are used aside from the d20s and d4s as far as I've read, but I stopped reading when they went into explaining the dice pools. My tired head wouldn't have processed that information very well anyways. I'd probably have to end up making a chart to remember it regardless. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Could you post a sample character if you have time? I've been curious of how a character looks beyond the character sheet that FFG posted and have yet to see one on their forum.

Here you go:

### **Sketchpad** (2012-10-23 17:32:53)

Huh. Interesting. I'll be snagging the beginner's box when it comes out and, if the group digs, the main book when it's released next year.

### **Sketchpad** (2013-01-06 01:18:10)

Okay, so I got the Beginner Box for the new SWRPG and I have to say I'm digging it. IMHO, the game feels like a fusion between d6 and Saga, but bit more story driven. I'm almost tempted to try running a sample game on a G+ Hangout or something.

Let me know if you do. I've also been having good luck with [Roll20](http://roll20.net "http://roll20.net")which has hangout integration.

G+, Hangout. What are these things you speak of?

### **Sketchpad** (2013-01-08 13:49:43)

Will do, Alicia. If I decide to go that route, I might look at doing it on a Sunday. I'll keep you informed.

Geez, Yogi. Get with the times, Old Man*! <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
G+ = Google+, a social network like Facebook. Hangouts are video chats within G+ that many people use to game long distances.
