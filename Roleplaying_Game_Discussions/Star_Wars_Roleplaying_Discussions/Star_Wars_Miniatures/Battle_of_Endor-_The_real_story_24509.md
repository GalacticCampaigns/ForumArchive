# Battle of Endor- The real story

### **Anonymous** (2009-12-21 20:42:31)

Every one heard of what happened at Endor.
Everyone knows that the Rebels, upon learning of the second Death Star, launched an attack on it with the intent to destroy it and killing Emperor Palpatine.
Everyone knows that a rebel strike team was dispatched to destroy the shield generator.
What they don't know, is that shortly before they arrived, a beverage company is questionable morals, was given the ok to test a beverage that was made from the urine from clones of Mandalore the Indomitable and Mandalore the Ultimate on the local Ewoks.
The Ewoks broke free with several hundred gallons of the substance and proceeded to spread it around the area.
This resulted in the Imperials being defeated. Fortunately, the substance is very short lived and, after the battle, all the Ewoks that had partaken of the substance were lethargic for the next three months.
