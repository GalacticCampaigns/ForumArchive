# Legacy of the Force pulls...

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-30 20:12:59)

Did anyone pick up the new Legacy of the Force boosters??
I got two cases..and I have to admit that the paint job leaves a lil to be desired..but the sculpts are really getting good. -^-
The Human Scoundrel and the Elite Rebel Commando are awesome.

Ya I got a few packs. Some of the stuff looks awesome some not so good. Would have liked to have pulled Cade but Got Talon instead so all in all good pulls so far.
