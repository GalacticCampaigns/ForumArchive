# Star Wars Miniature Managers

If your as fanatic about the Star Wars miniature game as me then you must have a manager to keep inventory and to help build your squads.
There are two that I know of, and the first one is an online free service. Only problem is I can't seem to register. It has something to do with e-mail filters, but maybe you will have more luck.

This is one my favorite, its a stand alone program that a Star Wars miniature fan built. Its free, but I donated to him because it has been invaluable to my Star Wars miniature experience. Its called Star Wars Miniature Manager and you can download here for free, made by Chuck. He is active on the Wizards forums, so if you have request or just want to say thanks go visit.
