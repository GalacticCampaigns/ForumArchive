*Lorsic uses move light object to grab the rare mini in the middle of the arena!*
**Lorsic**, "HA!, all mine, my preshhhhhhious"
*Lorsic cradles the mini in his hands and protects it by crouching down.*

*Force Grips Lorsic into submission*
Although you know, this sort of contest is really beneath me as a rule.

*Walks in and stands next to zerah holding a thermal detonator with a fail-deadly trigger*

*Quickly ducks barely being missed by the first swing of the lightsaber from the attack*
"You certainly maybe thelastfool as this is a fail-deadly trigger if I let go the thermal detonator will go off, cease your attack. I do not want to harm the woman I only want the mini's!"
> ~uses mind trick on SQuigley~ &quot;You do not want to blow up anyone for minis.&quot;

"Yes I do-a. What? You think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Plasticcrackdarian, mind tricks don't work on me. Only mini's. No mini's, no deal, I use the detonator!"
