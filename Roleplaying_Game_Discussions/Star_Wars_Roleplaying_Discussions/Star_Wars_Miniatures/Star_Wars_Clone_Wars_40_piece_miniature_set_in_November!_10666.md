Knights of the Old Republic is coming out in august and we will finally be immersed into the old republic with pieces like Darth Malak and a New Mandalore which will be another 60 piece set.
In November a 40 piece set using characters and vehicles from the upcoming Star Wars Clone Wars series is coming out, but I'm not sure if it will be a Huge set, but it sounds interesting.
