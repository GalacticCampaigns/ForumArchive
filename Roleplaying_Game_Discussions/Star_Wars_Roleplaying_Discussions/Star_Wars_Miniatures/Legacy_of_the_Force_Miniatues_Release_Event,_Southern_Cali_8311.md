# Legacy of the Force Miniatues Release Event, Southern Cali

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-16 06:37:01)

For those of you that live in Southern California and are close to Studio City you may be interested attending a Legacy of the Force Miniatures Release Event.
The new Star Wars miniature set : Legacy of the Force is coming out, and on March 28th, 6:30pm in Studio City @ Knight Ware store there will be a release event. I thought I would invite any one who was interested in playing or wanted to learn. It's a sealed box event, all levels of play are welcome. You must purchase two boxes of miniatures which is about $30, and you keep the miniatures of course, plus you get a free promotion piece usually.
I will be there hopefully <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->) I plan on going.
Starts at 6:30pm till it ends which I think is around 9:30pm
