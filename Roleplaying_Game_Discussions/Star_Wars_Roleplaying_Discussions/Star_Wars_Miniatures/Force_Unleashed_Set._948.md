Force 2.
Force Sense - Force 1: usable only on this character's turn. Enemy characters lose Stealth for the rest of the round.
Princess Leia of Cloud City Strategy Tips
This new Princess Leia fig lets you add a bit of "Peekaboo, where are you?..." to your squad so sneaky Yuuzhan Vong and other characters can't pull any weird tricks. She's a bit weak, but can blast small minions reliably and doesn't need to be out in the open to use her powers. Have her hang back, then user her power when you have a great chance to blast a ton of your opponent's figs apart!
Star Wars Miniatures - K-3PO

Commander Effect:

K-3P0 Strategy Tips
Ok, he's a wuss. But he helps your squad kick butt! Switching two figs lets one fig make a full attack then get swapped for another fig, then that fig gets a full attack too. This is awesome. It kinda blows that he's a Rebel because they don't have many strong characters, but he'll still make your Gonk droids as fast as lightning!
Star Wars Miniatures - Upcoming Previews!
We're just getting started with previews for Star Wars Miniatures: The Force Unleashed! Come back next week for a look at a fancy noble with purple eye feathers and a big bad dude with a secret apprentice and some force powers to unleash.
These are some of the new minis thaqt are in the FU set coming out on Nov 18th. enjoy. Ganthet.

> Force Powers Known (Use the Force +17): **corruption**, Force grip, Force lightning, Force slam, Force thrust, mind trick, move object, **repulse**, and surge

some things are a little strange though, as he appears to have more powers than he should have

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-12 03:55:20)

Maybe they are talents or feats that act as force powers... or just another misprint.. hehe

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-12 05:50:54)

: wizards misprint no never I won`t believe you, next you will tell me that mass prints of their product would go out to the people with misprints. Never man it couldn`t happen ...... ok I will shut up now. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-30 19:22:33)

The **Diplomat** special ability looks great for gambit players.
The Caamasi Noble, Fringe, Cost 5, HP 10, Def 12, Atk +0, Dmg 0
**Diplomat** (This character is not a legal target, and does not count as the nearest enemy, if an enemy without **Diplomat** is in line of sight. These restrictions apply even to adjacent attackers.)
That means if your opponent does not have a character with Diplomat, you can sit you Diplomat in gambit, heck if you had enough diplomats you could fill all the gambit spots. LOL
I wonder since its not a legal target if it provides cover, or if you can move through the square the diplomats in.
If you can't your going to see diplomat walls. LOL

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-31 11:14:00)

What do you guys think of the Rebel Vanguard fig. I think he is going to force change in how people play and map choices. Cheap Missles 30 on the Mustfar map that would be huge. Starting off destroying almost all your oppenets squad in 2 moves. Not a good thing. This will make Rebel army big.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-31 18:07:25)

Ya, Mustafar. :
I was a huge fan of the 150pt squads, but I'm leaning towards 200 now, jut to get away from map abuse.
Also, at 200 you have much more combinations and options making the games more dynamic and exciting
If you were on Mustafar on the bad side and lost initiative to a swarm of cheap missiles your toast, but then again if your on the bad side of Mustafar your usually toast anyway.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-11-01 17:43:32)

Here is the newest perview from wizards. Not alot of meat here but cool non the less.

Hope you like. =]--

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-10 15:06:53)

I dont think Mustafar is unplayable...just diffuicult
At GenCon there was a great many number of Mustafar maps in play....I think the new set will change the way some armies are played...seeing how there are now 2 characters that have disruptive in the Rebel faction.

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-12 04:25:10)

There was a French site that had pics of the new miniatures but they got shut down. If someone else knows or has links to another mirror site please share. If I find anything I will post. I saw about 3 new miniatures, I will try and get them from my friend and post before the 16th.

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-17 08:26:36)

Looks like The Force Unleashed is already in Chucks SWminimanager program.

### **ganthet** (2007-11-28 01:15:25)

Got it thanks Lorsic. Hey what did you pull? Did you guys get your sets made?

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-11-29 07:53:59)

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-01 06:17:22)

I want to trade The Force Unleashed for The Force Unleashed to make a full set.
Go buy some more boxes Ganthet! heheh.
Let me know Master Tru, I will search the Wizards GTL for you list.
I would love to get a darn Rancor, that would make my day.
My list was bumped off, and I haven't started a new one yet, but I think I am going to put one up again.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-12-01 15:26:28)

I am working on it. I need the pieces to I just thought if anyone wanted the older stuff I would post it. I am willing to work with people on this. Basically what i posted is what i don't have so far. I will let you know if I pull any extra of the new set.

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-12-01 18:49:51)

Question how much are the hoth packs going for?

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-02 00:19:25)

$59.99 + tax Last Time I visited Target near my house they still had one.
There was a little problem with product when it first came out. There was a misprint on the product # and some people got them for $9.99.
BTW, Boba Fett, Mercenary was traded today so I don't have him anymore.
Which The Force Unleashed minis do you have Tru?

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-12-02 06:47:57)

I have a few I would be willing to part with, more on the way:
Han Solo of Hoth (bagged)
Luke Skywalker and Yoda (bagged)
Felucian Warrior on Rancor
Wookiee Hunter AT-ST
Of course I have others from other sets, so far I have only opened one case of FU (sounds like I am telling you all off <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> lol ) anyway I am mostly looking for the Hoth pack (being up in Canada eh they have decided not to ship up here <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> ) . Has anyone found, or knows of a good site that shows mini values? 59.99 for the Hoth packs sounds standard to me, though 9.99 would be better.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-03 01:26:28)

I have these for trade. I would really like to grab a Felucian Warrior on Rancor, Wookiee Hunter AT-ST and Han Solo of Hoth in that order.
All bagged (if that matters)
Proxy x2 ($6)
Luke Skywalker and Yoda ($25)
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Unleashed ($12)
Kazadan Paratus ($8)
Maris Brood ($20)
Since you already have LUke Skywalker and Yoda I offer
Proxy
Obi-Want Kenobi, Unleashed
Kazadan Paratus
Maris Brood
46
For your
Felucian Warrior on Rancor
Wookiee Hunter AT-ST
If you would like Tru, I can go and see if they have another one at the Target nearby, buy it, and ship it to you. Its a big box, I'm guess shipping will be around 15 bucks. It also comes with a box of bounty hunters. Let me know.
As far as mini values I use <!-- m -->[http://www.miniaturemarket.com](http://www.miniaturemarket.com "http://www.miniaturemarket.com")<!-- m -->, but they don't have all the miniatures. This is another good site <!-- m -->[http://store.strikezoneonline.com/Single/SWM/TFU_S.html](http://store.strikezoneonline.com/Single/SWM/TFU_S.html "http://store.strikezoneonline.com/Single/SWM/TFU_S.html")<!-- m -->
Rancor goes for $35
Wookiee Hunter AT-ST $12
Han Solo of Hoth $10

Luck dog. I got Bib Fortuna. BTW Tru I forgot I have an extra Bib Fortuna if you want it.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-12-06 01:28:52)

Well I have the extra Vader for trade if anyone wants it. I got some more stuf from the new set. I got Wedge, 2-1B, Shaak Ti, Vader's Appentice Redeemed. I haven't pulled alot of doubles this time around. Hey maybe we should start talking squad building on her to. What you guys think?

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-06 01:34:58)

Of course. Hey Tru do you think you could start a new thread for Squads.
I got a pending trade going, or I would offer my Luke/Yoda for Shaak Ti. I really wanted to get a Vader's Apprentice for my Luke/Yoda, but I can't seem to find anyone with an extra Vader's Apprentice.
I am interested in your Shaak though, if you don't trade her away then I will try to make an offer soon. After I finish dealing with this guy.

### **ganthet** (2007-12-06 01:50:55)

Those are al one ofs if I get extra i will let you know.

### **ganthet** (2007-12-07 13:34:30)

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-08 06:34:10)

I go sooo many of those carts, I think I have 4.
I just traded for Vader Unleashed, and I just traded away my Brood.

Hehe. I just need a Chewbacca of Hoth and Shaak Ti, Jedi Master to complete the set.
If anyone has them and wants to trade let me know.
