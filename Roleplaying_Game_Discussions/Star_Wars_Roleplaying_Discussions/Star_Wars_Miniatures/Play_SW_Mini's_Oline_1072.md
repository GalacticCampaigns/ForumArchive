# Play SW Mini's Oline

Thats right. There is a program called Vassal that will allow you to play mini's with friends over the internet. Cool thing is its free, the basic pack doesn't come with the module for Star Wars mini's but they have the module on the site (its free as well). So check it out!
Heres the linkage: <!-- m -->[http://www.vassalengine.org/community/index.php](http://www.vassalengine.org/community/index.php "http://www.vassalengine.org/community/index.php")<!-- m -->

I download Vassal and all the mod for SW, but I don't have anyone to play with <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->(.
I don't know my way around the program that well, but if anyone wants to give it shot I willing to figure it out to get some game time in.

Well if you want to give it try I am willing.
I get off work at 3am Pacific Standard Time.
Sometimes that works out for people, I know its a messed up schedule, but I work nights.
I do have an occasional day off, and could try to play late at night starting around 10:00pm PST.
If anyone is game I want to play.
I'm a big star wars miniature player, and probably one of the few on the west coast. I even traveled to GenCon Indy this year to play for 3 days. It was heaven. If you love gaming, everyone must make at least one trip to GenCon Indy, its the Mecca of gaming.
