I was kind of meaning the idea of the squad. Like on wizards where you post a squad and then someone tells you what they think.

Ya, but this is a good thread too. We can leave the Miniature thread for general questions and such.

Need Vader's Apprentice, PM if you have one to trade.
Oh BTW Ganthet I dropped out of that trade with my Luke/Yoda.
So if you want to trade your Shaak Ti for my Luke/Yoda, let me know
