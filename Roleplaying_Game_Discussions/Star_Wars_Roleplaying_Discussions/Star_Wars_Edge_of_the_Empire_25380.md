# Star Wars: Edge of the Empire

So I broke down and bought a copy of SW: Edge of the Empire after finding it for a decent price. I've only briefly looked through the book, but have had a chance to play around with character generation. Overall, I like the game. Much as I was reluctant to try it, the FFG Forums convinced me to grab a copy and I'm happy to eat my words about it. The book takes its time explaining the die codes and how to interpret them, plus it gives a chart for using normal dice with the game.
The Good
• It's pretty simple to play. Everything has a difficulty which is rated in dice. Combat is pretty straightforward and the basic mechanics remind me a bit of the old d6 game.
• It's pretty. The book is gorgeous. Weighing in at over 300 pages, the design quality is great and the artwork is some of the best I've seen for the game. The layout is player friendly, with the Talents for each Occupation pieced together in a logical manner.
• It emulates the genre. Playing in the pre-OT era can be a strange and deadly place, and the game deals you what you should expect.
• Obligation. I love how it works and can't wait to do something with it in my next game.
• The GM Screen. Get it. It's a nice, sturdy screen that has a TON of info on it.
The Bad
• No cannon characters are in the book. While some may not mind this, I would've liked seeing Vader and Han in it.
• Mediocre selection of ships. I'm really hoping we'll see a ship book soon.
• Limited on the aliens. I know why they limited it to a little over a handful of species, but I would've liked to see official write-ups for a few more. Rumor has it the explorer book might have Chiss in it.
I'll be using EotE for my games for the time being. The first adventure has already been announced (with The Wheel in it!) and the first splatbook for Explorers has also been announced. Looking forward to the rest of the line. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll need some mustard for these words I'm about to eat. Let me know if anyone has Qs and I'll try and answer them.
