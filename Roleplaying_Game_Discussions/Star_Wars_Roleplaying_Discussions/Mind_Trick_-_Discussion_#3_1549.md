# Mind Trick - Discussion #3

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-26 03:54:55)

I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, I thought I could continue the great Discussion threads, and I think Mind Trick deserves some time.
Is Mind Trick destroying your game, plot, or encounter? When do we say no as a GM to Mind Trick and when do we let the players shine?
It has already happened in my campaign, a player before a climatic combat avoids it altogether after the villain starts his monologue on how he is going to kill him and his companions. The Jedi convinces him that it is best to leave and be on his way. He rolls a natural 20, and I can't find any reason to stop the action since the man being tricked is the leader and no other sub commanders or high ranking officers were available to use perception to see what was happening.

The best way to handle this is to flat out tell your players this will run like a cinematic, or like the movies. Saga is more about story than fighting in most cases so the GM should fudge rolls, or just flat fake the result. Or just not let them do it at all. If there mature, they should understand.
Thats how I would handle it. Let the player roll, roll behind the screen.......nope, sorry doesn't work. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

This is a toughie, I'll give you that. What's keeping Jedi from just mind trick the bad guys from walking themselves into a jail cell? Or mind tricking the spy to give away all the secrets? I'd go with Rowen in this one: talk it over with the player. See if you can find a nice middle ground where the power is still very effective, and the story isn't de-railed...more than it already is with the players being invovled.
Then again, if you allow Mind Trick to be all that and a bag of tricks, then you have the makings of a great anti-Jedi game.
"Citizens! I call for your support in the destruction of the Jedi! They take our free will! They neuter our minds, strip us of our humanity, and force us to fall in line with their way of thinking! Fight back now! Take up arms! Listen not to their sorceries, and strike them down before they can warp your very thoughts!"

> This is a toughie, I&#39;ll give you that. What&#39;s keeping Jedi from just mind trick the bad guys from walking themselves into a jail cell?

when I read this I thought of Jolee Bindo from KOTOR I, and the exceptionally comic scene where he escapes a holding cell...
But another suggestion, isnÂ´t there something in Mind TrickÂ´s description (donÂ´t have my book with me) that says something like "it canÂ´t be a completely unreasonable suggestion"?. You could argue that the mentioned suggestion is unreasonable, since the BBEG has planned for a long time what to do with the PCs, and to *him*, just giving them up is unreasonable.

This hasn't yet come up in my games, as I only have one Jedi and they haven't picked Mind Trick.
DarthAnthrax, the power reads "you make an otherwise unpalatable suggestion seem completely reasonable." Unfortunately, I can see this being read to support *or* counter your argument.
An unpalatable idea is one that leaves a bad taste in the victim's mouth, but it isn't one that they'd never consider (support). This is how I as a GM would interpret the words. However, it could be just as valid to say that the degree of "unpalatable" isn't defined (counter).
The advice to discuss the power with the player seems to have merit. I'd definitely want to discuss what we both think the above sentence actually *means* and come up with a compromise we both accept (or, if needs be, declare my interpretation the valid one for the purposes of my game).

This is hard. In the movies they do it to ecape from unessary combat. Obwan and Luke in the speeder with StromTroopers standing around them looking for the Driods. Mind Tricks cool but I don't see it able to stop someone who has spent along time preparing to fight the Jedi they are going to know about there powers and would make defences against it.
I also agree the Rowen and I would fudge the roll alittle for story effect. Why not you spent a great deal of time building the bad guy to have him stopped in 2 seconds.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em;">A friend of mine put it this way: Imgaine if, one that rainy landing pad on the cloner&#39;s planet, if Obi-wan just walked up to Jango Fett, waved his hand, and said &quot;Let&#39;s go inside, and talk. You don&#39;t need your weapons.&quot; (might require two hand waves). Man, that would have been a boring scene.
Why didn&#39;t Darth Vadar just wave his hand and say &quot;Luke, it&#39;s not what you think. Here, let me teach you. You can trust me; I&#39;m your father.&quot;
Why did Obi Wan bother bargaining with Han Solo if he could have just mind tricked him?
Pretty much, I would definitely lean toward the story vs. the die roll here.  </span>

The hardest part as a GM is making a fair judgment quickly to keep the game going.
Its the calm before the combat that can cause problems, when the talking doesn't seem to be working and combat is soon approaching. The character realizes things are going bad (sometimes metagaming, but if that was the case and I noticed it he would fail automatically) and he/she tries to avoid the conflict using Mind Trick. I know Mind Trick should be used in the "Roleplaying" Chapters of play, but sometimes the "Roleplaying" scene flows into the "Combat" scene, which is what happened in my scenario. Maybe it was my fault, and I should have compensated for such a tactics, but just looking at the overall picture, the Mind Trick was perfectly legal, and ruined my encounter. I guess I should not have let it happen, because the enemies did have there weapons out, and were ready for combat. I must say though, it was pretty funny when my player rolled a natural 20 and enemy walked out of the room. Everyone was laughing at the table, so all in all we were still having fun and that's what its all about.
It just goes to show, as portrayed in the movie "The Incredibles"; Monologuing can get you killed. hehe, or in my cause, ruin my encounter.

There is something to be said for the ability to use mind trick to get out of combat. I would think that if you have two people who are mad aat one another and there is going to be blaster drawn could you use mind trick and it still be efective or would the setuation make it not work and then it hits the fan.
In the group I play in here the Jedi does not really use mind trick to get out of combat. He really doesn't use it at all. We mostly try talking our way out of the situation before it becomes combat time. Or the GM has a NPC start the whole thing and we have to finish it. I think with carateive thinking you could get around it and still have the combat or incounter you want.
