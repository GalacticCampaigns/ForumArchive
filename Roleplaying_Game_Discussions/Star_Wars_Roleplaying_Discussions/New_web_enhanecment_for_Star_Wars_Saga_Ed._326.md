I had hoped for a little more (1 species is a little weak), but it is always good when they release new content

I just hope that if and when they release an alien species guide book it isn't named, *The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life*. A little wordy and fluff-heavy for my taste.

As long as they do it right, I guess I can wait.
One species at a time is like dangling bait in front of us.
I think they are using the web enhancement at proving and testing grounds. When they finally see that its popular enough they can run a hard copy. I am seeing this a lot in other industries as well. Many companies find hard copies to expensive so they are starting to use e-mail as the forum of getting there magazines out.
I can not wait for a comprehensive encyclopedia of aliens.
