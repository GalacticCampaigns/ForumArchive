I was wondering if anyone here has picked up the new Knight of the Old Republic Campaign Guide. i have it and i know a few others do but I was wondering what you guys thought of it so far.
I like it, it has alot of good stuff in it and i can see where it will be vvery useful for players and GMs alike. I like the new Scoundrel Talents and The gunslinger Feat. Also it is nice to see the characers of the game and comic stated out for you.
