Very interesting idea, but I can't say I'm too keen on the implementation in practice.

The idea, and a few of the details are excellent, I think. I don't like how he is handling the races, for example. But over all, I like the image it presents.
Plus, the *reason* he's doing it...I think that's an awesome.
