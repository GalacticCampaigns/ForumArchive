# Discussion 5-21-2009 (Jedi Over Poweredness)

### **Rowen** (2009-05-21 07:17:29)

*I had attempted to do this once before and thought it might be fun to get the discussion threads going again. Please PM me with any thoughts and idea's concerning making this a regular occurrence.* 
We have all seen it, the discussion's on the Wizard Boards or even right here at GC. A lot of people believe Jedi are over powered, especially at the lower levels. As a Game Master this can pose some campaign imbalance's or ruin that perfect (or less than perfect because of that darn Jedi) encounter.
How do you, or people you game with keep Jedi in check? .....House rules? .....Harder Encounters?
Lets hear your thoughts!

As I said in some other thread, I think Jedi in particular (thanks to Block/Deflect mainly) and Force users in general are overpowered at lower levels.
The only game I am GMing is here at the site, and there we uses the new Force system I made up, and IÂ´ve tried to work away these early level imbalances from the Force by separating the Force into five different skills instead of one. So far I think theyÂ´ve been quite challenged >:D
As for playing using SAGA core system IÂ´ve always said that if you only uses good strategy, you can beat anything, even if it is overpowered at low levels. Area attacks, Aid Another and multiple attacks can all help to overcome a Jedi with Deflect. Numbers also help well. Force the Jedi to actually think, and not allow him to simply wade in, believing Deflect will protect him against everything. And if he does, make him pay for it.
However, I think you shouldnÂ´t be overly zeal in your quest to take down the Jedi. he is supposed to cut down mooks pretty easily, if he does it correctly, and thereÂ´s a reason people often hire professionals to take down Jedi. With the CW guide, we also got a new, great feat for Jedi Hunters: Overwhelming Attack. Create a small commando group of specially trained Jedi killers, give them this feat, and your Jedi should be really challenged.

One of the main problems with Jedi is...Skill Focus UtF. When it's taken at 1st level it's grossly unbalancing. A 3rd level Jedi with a UtF of 15 with block and deflect is a pain in the ass plain and simple.
It isn't till about 8 -10th level that the imbalance from SF:UtF is balancing out. There are several work arounds on the boards. Make SF be a +1 per every two levels. If taken at level 1 the bonus is only +1. At 3rd +2, 5th +3 and so on. Or restrict the taking of SF:UtF till later on in levels with the assumption that the character will come into his/her full Force potential with a certain level of training.
Also like DA said strategy against a jedi is also key. if the jedi is 50m from the enemy and they are loaded up with nade launchers and autofire weapons or an ambush is set up is key.

(bows to Rowan) I have arrived, sir.
The vast majority of the reason I dislike Jedi- force users in general, and Jedi in particular- is the novels. In the first three movies, everyone was a hero, including Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Liea, R2-D2, and even Lando Calrissian. Read the books now, and all you can see if Jedi this and Jedi that. If you ain't got the force, you ain't nuttin'. Han Solo has been regulated to being cool only in his ship. Deadly assassins require the Force, or they're only so much wasted power cells. And it goes one and on. The only major threat to the galaxy not solved by the application of Jedi was Thrawn. And I think his use of the Force (meaning, by his excellent control over the dark sider) was put in strictly because you need the Force to have a Star Wars novel.
I got more about the novels, but that's not the focus here.
Rule wise, in Saga, the power levels are much closer than they have ever been (Jedi to mundane). As far as I can tell, the biggest advantage Force powers give is more options. At the cost of two feats, you have a wide selection of powers that greatly expand what you can do in a given situation. And you still have all the advantages of everyone else. For example, if a Jedi and a Soldier were in a gun fight, the soldier could shoot the Jedi, throw a grenade, or a half dozen other things. The Jedi could do the exact same things the Soldier can, or choose from his force powers. It would one thing is those powers consisted of changing the color of his shoes on command, but they don't. The Soldier can be yanked from behind his cover, have his mind messed with, etc, etc. Oh, and he can be chopped in half with the glowy stick of dismemberment.
Seriously, though, every time I hear words akin to "You are no match for me, for I am Jedi!" I want to that over powered munchkin with a stick.
