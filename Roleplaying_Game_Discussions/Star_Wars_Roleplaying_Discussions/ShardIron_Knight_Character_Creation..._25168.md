# Shard/Iron Knight Character Creation...

### **BWS2K** (2012-01-28 15:21:39)

As many of you have figured out by now, I am a droid fanatic. I typically shun Force powers or cool weapons for neato droid systems like internal grappling guns or jump servos. I have some tentative House Rules regarding droids in my blog but I also have a bigger question for anyone up to the task:<div style="text-align: center;">
*How exactly does one go about creating a Shard character?*
</div>

These are listed under the **Iron Knights** section in the *Jedi Academy Training Manual*. At first glance it seems fairly straightforward. Let's say I'm making a twenty-five point character though - do I use those for the Shard or for the droid chassis? The Shard has modifiers... but so do chassis. Would you just stack them - essentially creating a droid character but then instead of a processor they have a Shard "installed" which further modifies overall attributes? It lists a medium size for them... should that just be disregarded? I have a similar challenge when dealing with droid brains from *Scavenger's Guide to Droids*. Any thoughts are appreciated!

Well, first of all, the Shard box says that the stats assumes that they inhabit a humanoid droid body, which would be the source of stuff like the size.
For modifiers, I´d say replace whatever modifiers you normally get from chassis/degree and use the Shard modifiers instead. Droid attribute modifiers don´t have to be purely based on hardware, but could be software instead, and in this case you are replacing whatever is normally specified from a certain chassis/degree with what the Shard can do. Essentially, I would treat the Shard character as the droid processor. Still, for point buy I´d treat the character as a droid (with -4 points), since essentially he won´t be able to use his Con score, so why would he ever put points there?
If you read through the material for the *Eclipse Phase* game I sent you a long time ago, you can probably get a pretty good understanding of how I would think of Shards.

Ah yes...*Eclipse Phase*. Your suggestions make sense - I never thought about the hardware/software part either. Interesting. Thanks! <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
