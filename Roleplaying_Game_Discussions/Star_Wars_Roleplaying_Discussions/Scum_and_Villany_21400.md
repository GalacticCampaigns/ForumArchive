Well I ordered it yesterday and should have it on the 20th. Who else is getting it?

From Amazon Zoe? I did and they sat the 20th.

Nope, from my local books, dvds, and cds store.
They use everyone except amazon, and nearly always get my RPG books on the day of release. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Ordered mine a few days ago, after reading the description on the WOTC site. I can't wait for the 20th.

Same here. There's a thread on the WotC site about it also. Someone got it last week from Amazon Japan.

Inquiry: How is this different from *Threats of the Galaxy*?
I was at the bookstore, and saw this and *The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide*. I opted for the latter, since I have yet to run a serious Saga game and already have *Threats*, which has gone unused.
I'll pick it up eventually, since I having a copy of all the Saga books, but the KotOR book and the upcoming Clone Wars book looks so much more interesting to me...

Basically? *Threats* was kinda a Saga version of the DnD Monster Manual. Not a whole lot of stuff in there for players. A bit, but not much. *Scum and Villainy* on the other hand is basically all about the players. Fabulous new character options (Races, Feats, Talents, Skill Uses....) gear customization rules (which are awesome in and of themselves)
Basically, if your group plays anything but Jedi, it's good to have.

Ah, I didn't realize it was a non-Jedi supplement. Sounds good, since I'm sure Jedi got a bump with KotOR and TFU.

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-31 07:10:51)

It's not so much a non-jedi supplement, as Jedi can use a lot of the stuff that's in it. But it's mostly aimed at other classes.... seemingly, most specifically the Scoundrel, and to a lesser extent Scouts and Nobles.
