# Heroes behind the wheel

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-26 22:27:23)

I have a question about Starships (and vehicles in general) and heroes.
I know the vehicle stats in the book are set up in such a way a GM can pretty much go by what the stat block says and it covers all the pilots skills and whatnot.
Letâ€™s say I wanted a GM controlled B-Wing to fly in and harass my PCs, I could use the stats right out of the book.
But what if one of my heroes wanted to hop into that B-wing? Aside from Attack Rolls and Reflex Defense, what else is altered by the presence of a PC in the cockpit?
Also, for Attack and Defense, you have to subtract the skill level of the crew given in the book and then add the PCs bonuses.. is that right?
Forgive me if this is a novice question but Iâ€™ve poured over the Saga Rule book and Starships of the Galaxy looking for some clarification and havenâ€™t found anythingâ€¦ well, that and Iâ€™m a Star Wars D6 kinda guy <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->P
(I also like B-Wings)

YouÂ´d only have to subtract the crews attack bonus and then add your own, since generic crews donÂ´t add anything to defense.
Otherwise I think what youÂ´d need to modify is skill modifiers. A generic crew modifies only attack rolls and skill checks, so that should be the only thing youÂ´d have to change.

Keep an eye an armor if your PC is high leveled. If your character level bonus to defense is higher than armour you use that instead. This afaik is considered flat footed defense, not reflex defense. This is also why Jedi like to fly the tiniest fighters I guess <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Also remember the half heroic level bonus to damage - this is added on before the multiplier.

OK, just so I have this right...
I subtract the attack bonus of the crew and add the attack bonus of the PC.
I subtract the armor value from the ref defense and add the PC heroic level.
And add half heroic level to damage.
Everything else on the stat block stays the same?
I assume you use the initiative (or Pilot) of the PC for initiative instead of the initiative on the stat block.
Thanks for the help <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

You only replace the armor bonus if your heroic level is higher than the armor bonus.
And you replaces the skill modifier of the crew with the skill modifier of the person actually making the checks. In the case of Pilot and Initiative and Perception this is most likely the pilot, but Use Computer and Mechanics are typically done by other crew memebers or an astromech droid.
