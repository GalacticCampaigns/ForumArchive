This is a thread where I'll place any houserules I come up with. First off, Starships:
**Concealed Systems:** Any system can be built in such a way that it is hidden from detection. This concealment works against both visual and sensor inspection, and works whether someone is inspecting the ship at a glance from the exterior, or carefully examining it from the interior. The system can only be detected with a DC 35 Perception or Use Computer check, depending on the method of inspection used.
This improvement costs 1 Emplacement Point over and above what a given system will cost, and doubles the credit cost of the system. This modification may not be added to any system that is not the approprite size for the ship its installed on, such as Turbolasers on a Colossal ship. This modification may be added to a pre-existing system.
Note that this modification renders a system invisible to detection. Each round the system is used in an encounter, any observers may make a new Perception or Use Computer test to detect it with a cumulative +5 bonus. The GM may rule that the system is automatically detected, if it makes sense in the situation, such as a ship with all of its weapons hidden suddenly opening fire.
**Disguised Systems:** These systems are specially disguised to look like something else. Often, the "something else" is a lower powered version of the same system, disguising a Turbolaser to look like a normal Laser Cannon, for example, or a Class x0.5 Hyperdrive to look like a Class x3 hyperdrive. As with the Concealed System modification listed above, it costs 1 Emplacement Point and doubles the credit cost of the system, and may be added to an existing system. It requires a DC 35 Perception or Use Computer check to detect the disguise.
This system works best when one system is disguised as a system of similar type, a Turbolaser disguised as a Laser Cannon for example. Each round the system is used in a given encounter, observers are entitled to a Perception or Use Computer check to notice the disguise. If the system is disguised as something completely different, a Turbolaser disguised as an Escape Pod, for example, this check is made with a cumulative +5 Bonus each use, and the GM may rule that the disguise is automatically detected if the situation warrants.

**System Size Restrictions:** A ship may mount systems designed for vessels one size catergory larger or smaller than itself, mounting a Sublight Acceleration Motor or Turbolaser on a Colossal ship for example, but the Emplacement Point and Credit cost of the system is tripled. Also, if the vessel is ever reduced 3 or more spots on the condition track, the system is disabled until the ships condition track is completely restored. If the ship is ever disabled as a result of condition track hits from a single encounter (reduced to -5 on the Condition Track) the system is destroyed outright and must be replaced.

**Jedi Knight:** The BAB +7 requirement of the Jedi Knight PrC is instead changed to Minimum 7 heroic levels, to accomodate Jedi Knight builds that are not optimized for combat, or for Jedi who have taken thier first character level in another class to start with different class skills.

**Double Weapons** When fighting with a double weapon that is appropriately sized for you, you are considered to be fighting with two light weapons. Any talent, feat, or other ability that may be used with two light weapons may also be used with a double weapon, and the double weapon may also be used with Weapon Finesse. This rule also applies to double bladed lightsabers. You must be proficient with the weapon used to gain these benefits.
