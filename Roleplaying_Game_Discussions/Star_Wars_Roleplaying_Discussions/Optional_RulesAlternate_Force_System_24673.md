# Optional Rules/Alternate Force System

### **Thraken** (2010-05-28 18:08:04)

Here I be, having another stab at it again. My on and off Saga projects are Mass Effect and Star Trek, but as I'm playing the Sith Lords restored content mod, my old KOTOR3 campaign ideas are brewing again.
These are some hastily thought out mods to the Force System to be generally more versatile than the current - it only works if you follow the script - system. Originally I was thinking of simplifying DarthAnthrax's force system, but the issue there was that I had no way of limiting the number of force powers known - the Intelligence based bit is something I just put in. I also reverted Force Strength down to the standard numbers from raw Saga. Being simple enough to put into two optional rules boxes and being usable on the fly is a big plus of these I think.
**The following optional rules may be used alone or together**
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Force Strength**</span>
> Force Training, instead of granting force powers grants 1+Wis mod (minimum 1) of Force Strength and 1+Int Mod (minimum 1) Force powers. You need only choose a Force Power once, and use of a Force Power instead consumes one Force Strength rather than removing it from your Force Suite.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Force Power Group**</span>
> Similar Force Powers are grouped together, with rare Force Powers remaining alone. If a character knows at least one power in the group they may use any of the other powers in the group with a penalty to their Use the Force Skill check. In general, larger groups (such as telekinetic powers) should have a larger penalty than small groups consisting of only a few powers. If a character knows more than half the powers in a group their skill check penalty is reduced by one step. Powers with the [Dark Side] Descriptor are exempt from skill check penalties.

Thoughts? Opinions? Flaming? <span style="font-size: 0.50em;">please be gentle</span>

In honesty I do not really like any of those two rules presented.
First off Force Power gives a force user even more flexibility and versatility, when they are already amongst the most versatile characters out there. Also it doesn't state if you lose the power if you use a related power from the group.
As for Force Strength, then I feel that it just makes the Jedi more MAD (multiple attribute dependent). With Force Strength the Jedi do not have any stats that it can allow to be low, since all are needed. On the other hand the force user focusing on mental attributes will be so supremely flexible, easily having 8-12 powers that they can spend as they wish. So if he is fighting lots of crappy opponents he has 8 force slam, if he's against a force user he has 8 Sever Force, if he's fighting someone awesome he has 8 enlighten or 8 battle strike.

You know I like the Force Strength idea <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: --> Limiting it to having a few powers instead of having a few skills to draw from as I did could work, though I am a bit worried that you´ll be encouraged to spam the same power over and over again, since you are now more limited in your choice. Having a set cost of 1 FS for each power is interesting, and something I´ve toyed around with. I think it loses out on some balance though, which was why I had powers increase in cost at higher DCs.
Your second idea I´m not too sure about. Mainly because it seems you would get very many groups, or very broad groups. I mean the devs saw fit to give us a few descriptors, but most powers does not have a descriptor. Which means that creating good groups for the rest of the powers could be difficult. It´s an interesting idea though.

wheee~ 0 to 50% approval rating...
I'm thinking on changing Force Strength. Having both Powers and Strength Depending on the one feat seems a little heavy for me. But separating it out into two feats doesn't work due to the scarcity of feats. hmm...
/me goes to plagiarise DA's rules moar
> First off Force Power gives a force user even more flexibility and versatility, when they are already amongst the most versatile characters out there. Also it doesn&#39;t state if you lose the power if you use a related power from the group.

Versatility depends greatly on build, especially so at lower levels. I think low level Jedi are are rather inflexible. And yes. If "Force Power Groups" are used alone then using a group would remove it from the suite like normal.
> As for Force Strength, then I feel that it just makes the Jedi more MAD (multiple attribute dependent).

Is that a bad thing? I think in RCR they were encouraged to be good in all stats.
> On the other hand the force user focusing on mental attributes will be so supremely flexible, easily having 8-12 powers that they can spend as they wish

That just means they want to be a 'caster' type. If they wanna be that and lose out on other abilities why not?
> So if he is fighting lots of crappy opponents he has 8 force slam, if he&#39;s against a force user he has 8 Sever Force, if he&#39;s fighting someone awesome he has 8 enlighten or 8 battle strike.

Or if a Sith Lord decided to smack his kid around with Move Object half a dozen times.

Heh, I just thought it'd be the simplest choice working with Saga. Don't have to build an entire system like you did.
Spamming the same thing could be an issue, but that's what I created "Force Power Groups" for really. Either that or you have an uncreative or a one trick pony of a force user.
Indeed I see the balance issue with Force Powers. However feats aren't equal to other feats, talents aren't equal to other talents and force powers aren't equal to other force powers. So I decided on 1 per force power for simplicity. I don't have to tag every damn force power with an energy efficiency grade like you with your system :P
> Your second idea I´m not too sure about. Mainly because it seems you would get very many groups, or very broad groups.

I think we all have varying views on how specific Force Powers work, hence the dependance on GM decision. I'll post my own set of proposed groups to help illustrate the idea later.
Back on Force Strength. How about under the Force Sensitive Feat:
> &quot;You gain half character level + Wis Mod Force Strength. Using a Force Power consumes a point of Force Strength instead of removing it from your Force Power Suite (Taking the same Force Power multiple times is unnecessary). Force Strength is consumed and regained in the same manner as Force Powers in normal rules.
> Special: Force Feats such as Force Boon and Strong in the Force each provide an extra point of Force Strength.

Feels like it doesn't introduce enough variation. Makes Force users a little too homogenous and similar in power?
Hmm.... the only other thing I can think of to tie it to is Force Points, but that's not much different...

Haven't got an example list for the Force Group thingy yet, but after browsing the d20SRD, got another idea for Force Strength.
I realised the DCs in the force powers themselves serve as a measure of "how hard" it is to use. I'm also intrigued by the vitalising idea.
> A Force Sensitive Character possesses Force Strength equal to their character level&#39;s Force Point total plus constitution modifier. Divide this number by 4, subtract three times and round down to determine Force Strength Levels.
> A force power consumes a point of force strength plus one for every DC step above your Use the Force Skill modifier.
> You may choose a lesser DC value, reducing the force power&#39;s effect for a corresponding decrease in cost.
> If your Use the Force Skill skill modifier is 5 or more greater than the DC of the effect you expend no force strength using the effect. The result of your use the force check however remains the same to be compared against a target&#39;s defense.
> If the Force Power is one compared against a target&#39;s defense with no DC levels then the highest affected defense sets the DC level. If the Force user voluntarily decreases the effect of this type of force power they can reduce the DC for the purposes of Force strength consumption by one step.
> Instead of regaining full use of the Force when taking a short rest for about a minute, you restore Force Strength up to the next Force Strength level. Otherwise methods of regaining Force Powers remain the same.
> If a Force User reduces his Force Strength to half (the second Force Strength Level) they move to to the 2nd step of the condition track until their Force Strength is increased. If a Force User Reduces his Force Strength to a quarter (third Force Strength Level) they move to the 4th step on the condition track until their Force strength is increased. Depletion of Force Strength moves a character 5 steps down the condition track and must roll to survive unconsciousness as normal.
> Similarly if a Force user is moved down the condition track by any other effect, at the 2nd step their maximum Force Strength is reduced to the first level (3/4). At the 4th step it is reduced to the second level (half)
> A Force User can spend more Force Strength than they have, moving themselves to the end of their condition track, but increase the Constitution DC to regain consciousness by the points of Force Strength they do not have.

Quite a lot more complicated - This creates a very steep gradient for Force Users depending on level.
For Padawan level Jedi it will be difficult to use the Force more than sparingly unless they have Skill Focus (pretty much all onscreen padawans we've seen I think). If they use force powers to their greatest extent they can with their skill they will condition track themselves, but will be able to use powers here and there if they're smart about it.
It ramps up very strongly with powerful higher levelled Jedi being inevitably "stronger and faster". At UtF 15+ a Jedi can basically have the lowest level of Surge active whenever they want to spare the reaction for it. At UtF 20+ a Jedi can spam DC15 effects indefinitely.
This is only a first draft so I do welcome brutal dissection. The thing least I'm least sure on is where to set the conditions as a result of force depletion. Maybe -1 step, -3 then -5 would be better.

I think this looks very interesting, though like you say it has a few bugs in it.

### **Thraken** (2010-07-02 11:54:16)

The only 'bug's I acknowledged were at what points to peg the condition tracking :P
The powerful nature of higher levelled Jedi was intentional. At ~15+ UtF I would expect powerful knights to Masters to have high powered duels with a good sprinkling of force power use (e.g. the RotS duel). At ~20+ it would easily accommodate Yoda's casual smacking of the two guards and the kind of Force Battle we saw between Yoda and Sidious.

Forgive me for delurking only to drop a rant.
My quest for a different force system isn't due to any desire for Jedi to be even more uber than they often can be (usually when players try to be <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> ). It is simply because I don't believe the system is fit for the purpose of a Star Wars RPG. I don't even mean the the horrors of Skill Focus (UtF) and Force sensitives in general. It just simply fails to be what it is in Star Wars.
It's just barely fit for the 'Saga'. Assuming the GM heavily scripts the adventure to maximise chances to use the powers the Characters possess - it barely fits the movies. However, any taste of the EU - or the Clone Wars - and the whole thing is out the window. The only way any character in Saga Edition rules can fit all that they do in the EU is to totally rebuild the character between every adventure. There's also miscellaneous poor design choices throughout in any case. Saga Edition isn't terribly consistent :
I guess I want characters to be as adaptable as they are as the now massive cast of 'main characters' that populate the Star Wars Universe. Here's my new and different idea, developed from things I'm pretty sure I picked up from the WotC forums but can't identify the originator or the thread themselves. I hope this one's a winnar.
**Under 'Force Points'**
> As a free action, any character can spend a Force Point to add any one Starship Maneuver to their Force power suite that can be used as normal. When used (or at the end of the encounter) it disappears and cannot be returned by any means.
> As a free action, any character who has the Force Sensitivity feat can spend a Force Point to add any one power to their Force power suite that can be used as normal. When used (or at the end of the encounter) it disappears and cannot be returned by any means.
> Any character can spend a Force Point as a free action to temporarily gain the use of a talent that is not currently in their Character sheet. A character must meet all the prerequisites for the talent (including appropriate character class) to be able to use it and the character can spend more than 1 Force Point over the course of an encounter to gain multiple talents. Talents gained in this manner temporarily count toward the prerequisites of other talents and the effects of these talents last for the remainder of the encounter.

**Under 'Dark Side'**
> If a Force Point is spent to gain the use of a Force Power with the [Dark Side] descriptor, but is not used - this is a minor transgression subject to GM judgement.
> If a character spends Force Points to gain the use of a Sith, Dark Side or other &#39;dark&#39; talents, at the end of the encounter the character increases in Dark Side Score equal to the number of Dark Force Talents gained.

This of course totally supplants the suggested rules written under "Temptation of the Dark Side". So now to make the dark side more tempting.
> As a free action, any character who has the Force Sensitivity feat can add a Force Point to their Force Point total at a cost of a Dark Side Point. If this Force Point is not used a character may choose to atone for their brush with the dark side, reducing their Dark Side score by one for losing the Force Point they gained. When used it disappears and cannot be returned by any means.
