Does Rapid Strike work with unarmed attacks? I'm thinking yes.

I see no reason why not.

I don't see why not. Any melee attack. I wonder....
If a Wookie rips off some dude's arm, and is swinging it like a club, does rapid strike work then? It *is* after all an un-armed strike <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

High enough that only a Wookie would be crazy enough to try it? :

I remember a thread on that very subject. I think it's just a use of the official optional rule maim though

I think the arm would be treated as an improvised weapon.

This whole discussion reminds me of something....
The ol Werewolf the Apocalypse card game. There were two cards in particular: Disarm, which removes your opponents weapon, and dis-arm, which featured a picture of a Werewolf holding the severed arm of another Werewolf in his hands and swinging it like a club.... he had this rather amusing smile on his face.

Heard about something in the old Ad&D game. Some one with a belt of ohmygod giant's strength was being attacked by werewolves. Since he didn't have any magic weapons, he couldn't damage the werewolves (one of the rules stated "can only be hurt by magic weapons, etc in the monster write up). Well, our hero smacked the wolves around for a bit, until he happened upon and interesting idea.
"Can werewolves hurt each other?" The GM, shrugged, bemused.
"Sure. Why not? Makes sense that they can."
Our hero then grabs two werewolves and starts swinging them around like nunchuks, bashing any than came within reach.
Wolf-chucks!

Crap we need improvise weapon master talents or something :PYes... A jackie-chanesque talent tree would be good for some characters...
perhaps for scoundrel class?

I think there was a feat back in the days of the RCR that let you treat improvised weapons as a weapon class. I think that could still work, if Improvised Weaponss wa a new category under Weapon Proficiency.
Then, if someone wants to write up a talent tree for it, that feat could be a prerequisite for the whole tree.
