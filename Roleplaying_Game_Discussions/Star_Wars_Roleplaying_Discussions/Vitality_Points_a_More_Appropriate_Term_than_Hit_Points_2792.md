**Warning: Long-winded essay written in Very High Galactic.** 8)
This post is the result of my academic interest in the following discussion: [http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=82](http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=82 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=82")
**Vitality Points: a More Appropriate Term than Hit Points**
Hit Points
Hit points (HP), as the Saga Edition rulebook states, represents two things. The first is that it is â€œthe ability to take punishmentâ€, while the second is â€œthe ability to turn a punishing blow into a near-miss.â€ (SWSE, p. 146) The main problem with this definition is intuitiveness. The first definition, that of punishment, is intuitive. A hit does, after all, mean actual, physical contact. However, the second, that of near-misses, is counter-intuitive. By definition, a near miss is â€œan accidental collision that is narrowly avoidedâ€ (Princetonâ€™s WordNet Online) and, by virtue of the word â€˜avoidâ€™, an antonym of hit, means that it is not a hit.
So, how does one reconcile the second definition to that of the first? Since each definition uses an antonym of the other, such reconciliation is not possible. Therefore, we must accept that the term Hit Points does not adequately represent the concept being conveyed by the designers of the system. To address this inadequacy, a methodology that takes each definition separately for analysis must be undertaken.
Hit Points: Analysis and Deconstruction
First, the issue of â€œtaking punishmentâ€ is addressed. At first glance, a discrete unit of measurement does help quantify a normally subjective concept. In this regard, we have the concepts of Constitution and itâ€™s derivatives, such as Fortitude Defense, as prime examples of this helpful quantification. Further on, there is Damage Threshold, which is a derivative of Fortitude Defense, and this quantity defines how much of a punishment a character can take before such punishment â€œreduce(s) (their) combat effectiveness, or in some cases, kill (them).â€ (SWSE, p.146) However, this quantification refers to the definition being analyzed â€“ the ability to take punishment. As such is the case, it is then redundant to give this definition another name; Damage Threshold covers the concept well enough as an umbrella term.
In addressing the second definition, â€œnear-missesâ€ and â€œavoidanceâ€, Reflex Defense must be considered. This term quantifies the characterâ€™s skill, talent or luck in dodging attacks. However, this term is defined as â€œhow hard (the character is) to hit in combat.â€ (SWSE, p. 145) This means that Reflex Defense completely forgoes near misses: any attack that does not beat the characterâ€™s Reflex Defense can be thought of as â€˜not hitsâ€™ (but not â€˜complete missesâ€™, as cinematic license allows characters to block/deflect on-screen attacks that were actually not mechanical dangers to them).
Now, despite part of this second definition coinciding with Reflex Defense by virtue of the term â€˜not hits,â€™ we are still left with the rest of the definition â€“ that is, the ability of the character to avoid attacks that beat their Reflex Defense. Seeing as there is no other previously established term in the Sage Edition rulebook to cover this leftover but critical concept, we must accept that it requires a term of its own. Fortunately, history provides us with one already: Vitality Points (VP).
Vitality Points
Vitality Points, which first appeared in the Star Wars Revised Core Rulebook but eventually saw inclusion in the broader d20 System via the System Reference Document (as a variant), is defined as â€œa measure of a characterâ€™s ability to turn a direct hit into a graze or a glancing blow with no serious consequences.â€ (d20srd.org) Deconstructing this definition shows us that this term satisfies the requirements we are looking for, which are the following: it is a measure, it refers to an avoidance ability, and the term â€˜direct hitâ€™ refers to an attack that beats Reflex Defense. The fact that the phrase â€˜with no serious consequencesâ€™ indirectly refers to the mechanic behind the Condition Track (despite the latter being the more recent concept) is an academic bonus. Whereas Hit Points refers to physical damage, Vitality Points refer to physical exertion, and this is the critical difference. Physical exertion takes a toll not on a characterâ€™s health (at least not directly), but on the characterâ€™s store of energy. Considering that energy is readily quantifiable (ex. joules, calories) while health is not (ex. feeling fine, feeling tired), we must then contend that between Hit Points and Vitality Points, the latter is more appropriate in a mechanical as well as cinematic sense. In fact, some concepts in the rulebook provide support to this contention.
Vitality Points: Evidentiary Support
The most telling evidence would be the Second Wind swift action. This swift action allows a character that has lost half or more of their total Hit Points to recover an amount of HP equal to either their Constitution or a quarter of their total, whichever is greater. (SWSE, p. 146) Using the official definition of Hit Points, this means that the character is, in effect, recovering from actual, physical hits within a round length of less than 6 seconds. This mechanic is impossible in a realistic sense; therefore it is impossible in a cinematic sense as well (outside of the Force, at least). However, if we apply the definition of Vitality Points to this action, this action means that such a character is, in effect, recovering energy used for previous physical exertion. Considering that a lexical definition of â€˜second windâ€™ itself refers to energy (Princetonâ€™s WordNet Online), this means that such a modified mechanic has support in both a realistic and cinematic sense.
Further supporting evidence lies in the section about Hit Points itself. The last sentence on the left column of p. 146 states that, â€œAs long as you have 1 Hit Point, (the character) can act normally on (their) turn.â€ (SWSE) Given the printed definition, if a character with a maximum of 1 HP still has 1 HP, then it is granted that s/he is healthy and can act normally. On the other hand, if a character with a maximum of 100 HP has 1 HP remaining (meaning, by definition, s/he has taken 99 HP worth of punishment) then it must be granted that s/he is very unhealthy and should not be able to act normally, even cinematically. (Note that it is entirely possible for a character to take 99 HP of damage without ever having their Damage Threshold beat.) In contrast, given the definition of Vitality Points, if these two characters both have 1 VP remaining, regardless of their maximums, then cinematically they can both act normally, despite the second character having spent 99 VP worth of energy turning attacks that beat their Reflex Defense into attacks of no serious consequence, as their actual health is not â€˜spentâ€™.
Conclusion
Thus, after taking into account the concepts behind the system, as well as its mechanical interaction with other concepts, we must conclude that Vitality Points is indeed a more appropriate term for use in Saga Edition. Although primarily a cosmetic change, this will result in role-playing that is both mechanical and cinematically sound, with the added benefit that it requires no re-introduction for GMs and players that have already experienced its use in the preceding edition.

yup I agree, and in far smaller terms :
Vitality Points and Hit points are essentially the same thing, but having "hit" in the name implies an actual physical hit.

Which is why simplyscribed and I will be using the term for our future games. In fact, he's already adopted it for Elder Legacy.

I can't believe you actually wrote the essay!
Very well put, though. You should post it on R2D20.

Semantics. Intuitive? Man your deep, but whatever gets your blood pumping.
Hit Points is just a generalize term familiar to most rpg players. If they called it Vitality Points, Collateral Damage, Resilience or Durability its all the same to me as long as I know what it does in game mechanics.
Vitality Points - Hit Points (tomato - tomato)
I guess if you were in a debate trying to win over the term to be used in the book you would have made a strong argument worthy of consideration. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
