# KOTOR Campaign Guide

### **Rowen** (2008-08-18 18:11:22)

Got my KOTOR guide today, how many others have theirs? Its a pretty nice book, a lot thinker than the last two released by Wizards. I have not not had a chance to really sit down and inspect it closer so I might do that here shortly. If anyone has questions about the book or would like to discuss the book in general, post away. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Did anyone else get the book? If so what do you think about it.

Just like the other books I think the book was shipped to soon before it was correctly proof read. I was talking to GreenDice about it last night and it just saddens me to see that they will just use players instead of editors to fix the product prior to me buying it.
Most of the feats and talents are decnet but the once per encounter deal is lame. I under stand that few of the feats should be that way but not most of them. Example is the Accelerated stirke can only be used once per encounter. Which I can understand due to its a feat but the jedi knight talent that allows you to attack with both ends of a double weapon or twin baldes that can also be used once per encounter makes me wonder whats the point? I mean should I waste a feat and a talent to get the once per encounter of just get dual weild and take my full attack and call it good. Simple things that drive me nuts I guess.
NPC's I like how they built most of them giving stats that don't exisit or giving them talents/powers/Force Tecniques they havn't listed in the book or that the NPC shouldn't have.
Equipment I like how they gave a weapon that jedi can finally fear the Sonic pistol/rifle :04 . Other then that ScaredPhoenix and I had been oging back and forth over the Neo Crusader armor due to its weight with the jet pack making soldiers encumbered heavily.
So now after getting all excited about the book I look forward to the errata :

Im sure there will be an errata in a couple of months. While the book has its flaws I was still more excited over it than either of the last two books. The Force Unleashed source book is a wanted addition as well.

Yes the Unleashed should have some interesting feats/powers/ etc in it. Heard they were coming out with a Clone wars Source book. Now if that comes out and is crap I think i'll hang up my Gm title and burn the books :

Ya waiting for Vol. IV to come out after reading the last one

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 21:00:03)

But like I said I think i'll wait until they release the revised books due to how much they messed up for better choice of words :|

going to go out and buy it soon. They ran out at GenCon go figure ... The run out of the book but barely even support the game. *sigh*.
The once per encounter doesn't surprise me. I would gather that we will be seeing more and more of these type of powers. I wouldn't doubt if we start to see Daily and At Wills soon. Seems like WotC doesn't know what to do with Saga. Its having a hard time deciding the direction of the new books.
I haven't looked at the new campaign book, but its my favorite Era so I will soon, I just kinda ran out of Cash going to GenCon <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)

Hey least you got to goto Gen Con, that would have been awesome to goto.
I like the KOTOR Campaign Guide, flaws included....of course once I start using it more they may stand out a bit more to me but right now its only minor.

For the longest time after I got mine I just looked at the cover. The artist they used for the cover deserves a raise!
I've just poked through the book since I got it on Tues, lots of new goodies to assimilate and place in perspective of the core book. I like what I've seen so far except for the lightsaber crystals. A few of them are what I had expected them to works as but the "once per encounter" rule annoys me to no end. (Iin general as well. Not just for lightsabers.) I guess I will have to see that in play.

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-03 17:46:55)

I found that a bit irritating too, especially with some of the talents.... (Riposte, 'm lookin' at YOU!)
I also found the Alternate Lightsaber Crystals rules a little irritating. If you have an alternate lightsaber crystal, you don't get the +1 Attack Bonus for spending a Force Point. So I guess that means I don't need to spend the Force Point....

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-03 19:59:20)

I'm with you on that one Bob I mean thats a load of crap in my point of view. Talking about both Riposte and its so called improvement and how many editting errors are in the book alone make me want to return it <!-- s:evil: -->![:icon_evil:](https://i.ibb.co/C5wQfzF6/icon-evil.gif)<!-- s:evil: -->

### **Alicia** (2008-09-04 10:10:17)

I'm thinking in regards to riposte that the got the paragraphs confused a little bit where Riposte can be used once per turn and Improved Riposte once per encounter.
If that's not the way WOTC intended well I think I will just ignore them until they do better.

I've heard they weren't but thats only word of mouth from other players on the wizard boards nothing concret. <!-- s:? -->![:?](https://i.ibb.co/KcdH3QwT/icon-e-confused.gif)<!-- s:? -->
