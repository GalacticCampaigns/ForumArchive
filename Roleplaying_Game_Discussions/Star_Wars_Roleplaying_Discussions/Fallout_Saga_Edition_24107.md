# Fallout Saga Edition

### **Tempeste** (2009-05-16 10:34:33)

Hey, I've been interested in running a Fallout saga edition game for a while. So I spent today rounding up some fanmade rules and adding my own to try and get enough together to run a campaign. It could do with being looked at by others though, as I'm sure some things arne't terribly balanced.

**Armour**
![armour-1.jpg](http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q152/colonel-tempest/armour-1.jpg)
(thanks to NClanceman, who also statted did alot of the original weapon stats though I've reworked most of them myself to be more balanced)

### **Tempeste** (2009-05-17 12:21:06)

Also, if anyone is interested in playing in this game. Please post as there seems to be little interest in Dark Heresy, maybe this'll be a more popular premise. There's probably alot of things I need to change but I think if I just sort out the primary things, the rest can be dealt with as they come up. I decided to redo all of the weapons and simplify them alot, shouldn't be too much now. I'm going to post up some armours too.
Other
The weapon Proficiency groups have now been changed. They are now Small arms, Energy, Heavy, Unarmed and Melee. Other feats/Talents related to weapon groups are also affected. Exotic weapons are treated the same.
The Jedi class no longer exists, and the standard species clearly arenâ€™t used, the same applies to standard saga weapons. Alternatives have been created.

Love Fallout. Was just about to start playing it after making a few posts on here. I'd be intrested, but would like to know some more info about how things will work (or provide input <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> )

### **Tempeste** (2009-05-17 13:33:27)

Well I'm trying to make it work with changing as little as possible, and without having overwhelming item lists (which is why I just redid the weapons and ditched the crafting rules). Talent/Feat wise the starship related choices won't apply anymore, though there are still vehicles around, they aren't common. Prestige classes should be ok mostly. There will be new races too I've decided on Vault Dweller, Wastelander, Tribal, Ghoul and Supermutant (non PC for obvious reasons).
<strong>Races</strong>
**Vault Dweller**
Stats: As Human
Born in the safe confines of a vault, deep underground and protected from the horrors of the wasteland. Your early life may have been boring and uninspiring but you were safe, which is a lot more than can be said for the childhood of most others. You were never destined to stay inside indefinitely though, and you left for the surface.
**Wastelander**
Stats: +1 to all defences, +5 on tests to resist Radiation
The wasteland is a harsh place and your life has been full of dangers and the harsh reality that you may not make it through each night. This has hardened your spirit though, and left you with sharp reflexes.
**Tribal**
Stats: +2 Dex/Str , -2 Int, Primitive Trait (Whatever class you start with, you gain only unarmed weapon proficiency)
Wasteland Predator: You may reroll stealth checks made to sneak, taking the better result.
You've lived a simpler life, amongst a small tribe of other humans, renouncing technology and creating your own food instead of relying on the scraps of the past.
**Ghoul**
Stats: +2 Dex, -2 Wis, -2 Cha.
Radiation?: Ghouls are immune to radiation.
You may be one of the oldest beings left on the planet, but it hasn't been a happy existence. Your body has been horribly mutated due to radiation and you're now badly disfigured. There are certain advantages to ghoulification, even if smoothskins look down at you with disgust.
<strong>
Classes</strong>
**Jed**i: No longer exists
**Noble**: Starting feats are now Weapon Prof (Small guns), Weapon Prof (Unarmed), Skill focus.
**Scoundrel**: Starting feats are now, Point Blank Shot, Weapon Prof (Small guns), Weapon Prof (Unarmed).
**Scout**: Starting feats are now Shake it off, Weapon Prof (Small guns), Weapon Prof (Unarmed), Weapon Prof (Energy)
**Soldier**: Starting feats are now Armour Prof (Light and Medium), Weapon Prof (Small guns), Weapon Prof (Unarmed), Weapon Prof (Energy)

As I said before, I'm in if we end up going through with this.
What were you thinking for starting character levels and wealth?

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-05-19 04:53:25)

Wealth is one of the things I'm not sure on yet. But character will be level 1, 28 point buys. Ok, I think I'll let character start with $2000 each. If it turns out characters are starting out with too little, or too much, I may change this. I think that's just about everything needed to get a campaign started, so I'll open a casting call in the next few weeks. For the purpose of character building, the weapon comes with enough ammo to start with.

Stimpack (medpack): See core Rulebook
