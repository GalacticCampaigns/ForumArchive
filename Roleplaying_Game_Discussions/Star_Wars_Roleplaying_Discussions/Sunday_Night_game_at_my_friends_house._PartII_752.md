The game i would be posting about has been put on hold. Another friend of mine will be running something else. Still Star Wars don't worry.
The game so far ( that I would be poasting about ) is about 5 adventurers who because of some reason are together. The character I play is Talon Rann CorSec Serucity Officer assigned to protect the Cerean Noble in the group. His father pulled a few strings and got it done.
There is a Wookie Scout who is kind of the Cereans companion she is some what good at what she does but the player hasn't deside what route she wants to take.
There is a Jedi in the group. He is a good fighter but alittle conficted about which side of the Force he is on. He has been kind of back and fort, but i guess it makes the character interesting. He has made most of his powers around lightsaber combat. The character did something interesting he gave my character a shoto or short lightsaber.
The Noble of the group the Cerean is a good Doctor and is agood soruce of money he is smart and specks about a hundred differnt Langueges but isn't good for much else. The guy that made him took all of the wealth and educated talents but non of the leadership stuff. Oh well.
There is a new character in the group a Zabrak Tech. She is interesting. I don't know to much about the character. Other than she dosen't like to see other people opressed.
That is about it for the characters. I will post some stuff about our adventures when I can. I will probaly post some about the new game to.

Well actually we are doing some stuff with the Dark Styder box set. I play Dack"Doc"Talon a young talented and very cocky X-wing pilot. I will try to put up some of his misadventures in here. He has a driod, an R2 unit named DeCoy. Funny I know but there is areason for it. He is a Lutinate in the New Republic Army. He is teamed with a Tech, A mechcanic that is a Yusim who is also is bunk mate, and there is a Captain that is also part of the group when the person shows up.
So far we have saved a planet from being destroyed by a plague, lost our commanding officer to the Imperials, had my X-wing shot up deffending the planet and provided aid for them and been stuck in the middle of a gang war. Hopefully with the new SotG book out now the space battles will be more interesting. My friend is running it the one that owns the house we play at. So far it is alot of fun. So if we play this Sunday I will let you know what happens. Later.
