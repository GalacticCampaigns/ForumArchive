# Droid Creation RAW...?

### **BWS2K** (2012-05-29 11:31:20)

So every time I build a droid with the core book I always have this question but forget to ask: **The book says that a medium droid comes with a heuristic processor, two legs, and two *arm* appendages. Does this mean two *hand* appendages or do you have to purchase probes/claws/hands/etc?** I sort of assumed it meant hands the first time I made a droid but maybe that's not a safe assumption. Thoughts?

I read something about this on the Wizards forum some time ago, and if you are to read it literally, a person would have to buy whatever appendage he wants to add to the end of his arms (hands, claws, tools, etc).
Personally though, I usually allow for 2 hand appendages for free. Assuming that most custom droids follow some kind of humanoid design baseline. Also, if I think about it the other way, and want to add say a third hand, what do I do about getting an arm to put it on? I just assume this all goes as part of the appendage deal.
The droid rules could have been more well explained, and unfortunately the Scavengers Guide mainly added good optional features rather than fix the old hazy ones, so we´ll have to live with things not always making sense to 100%.

Sounds good. I did have the thought "*Well maybe you can just buy extra arms…*" but you've still got the same problem - prices listed for hands, not whole arm appendages. Perhaps it's worded that way to allow the player to choose whatever hand appendages are wanted, but if a third hand/arm is needed you have to pay the listed price. It's also kind of weird to me that things like **magnetic feet** are based off of the cost of leg motivators when you get those for free... so you still have to price them out just to know what the magnets cost. Odd. I realize I had similar problems with Shards (the thread below this actually) and I guess they just didn't invest the time into completing droid build rules. Maybe most people don't use them, I'm just not most people. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

No, you do have an unusual fetish for all things mechanical...
Speaking of Shard, I´ve been having a PM discussion with a player of mine who wants to play a Shard, and I found that if I just skip the whole droid creation rules completely and build them like any other character, and just pretty much treat them as cyborgs, things got a lot easier.

Ouch. I think I creeped myself out there. What interests me the most is not just the fact that you're playing a machine, it's that you can explore the definition of "life". In the Star Wars universe you have the Force which allows for an intriguing opportunity to roleplay, in my opinion. You can Force Push droids... why? They aren't alive, and you can't Mind Trick them for that reason - so why can you push them around? Yoda says the Force exists because of life (disregarding the midichlorian business for a moment) and "*between… the tree, the rock… even between the land and your ship.*" So does he manipulate the air particles *around* the X-Wing to pull it out of the water? That's why Force Push works on droids? But then why wouldn't Mind Trick (for example) just re-write the physical circuitry or something? Sure, the SAGA rules have a power that allows specific manipulation/retrieval of droid memories or something, but I think that's just fluff to increase the total array of Force Powers because it sort of directly defies the whole concept of the Force as laid out in the CRB. The species section for a Shard, if I recall, says that they manipulate their droid bodies telekinetically - so there isn't an actual connection, Force-wise, between them and the shell anyway. Even their entire existence as Force Sensitives seems to fly in the face of basic teaching on the Force - how are they "alive" at all (and what's their midichlorian count...)? If crystals can be Force Sensitive, why can't computers? When my computer runs defrag or diagnostics - does that count as self-awareness? And so it goes, on and on...
Then I look at movies like Terminator, with Skynet, or Transformers and it makes me wonder how far mankind will get before it all ends. The entire concept of Cybertron alone is really neat.
Yeah, you're right about Shards. Part of the complication comes from the whole droids-don't-have-a-Con-score I believe, because theoretically Shards do. You could rule that they don't and just build whatever kind of droid you want and then overlay the Shard species modifiers after all that to represent being installed in an already existing droid shell. I think you'd just ignore the Con stuff if it ever got hit - it's just a crystal so maybe use a DR/HP if ever required.

Don´t take me too literal...we all like different things <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
To me, the notion of why you can Force Push but not Mind Trick droids is not complicated at all. Force Push is an application of telekinesis, and as such is used to move physical matter. Droids are physical matter, hence they can be moved. Droids however does not have a mind that functions like our own, and thus is extremely difficult to affect. Note however that there exists some canon examples of people who have managed to master this skill, it is known as [Mechu-Deru](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mechu-deru "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mechu-deru"). And you also have the Subelectronic Converter implant from the *Jedi Academy Training Manual*, which makes this ability easier. And as you´ve also noted, the Technometry power touches on the surface of these powers.
As to the Shard, I wouldn´t draw to many paralells between them and droids, clearly, the Shard are an organic lifeform whereas a droid is in fact just a basic assembly of electronic circuits and metal. This should also answer the question about why they can be Force Sensitive while computers can´t. And no, your computer isn´t self-aware when running defrag or diagnostics - it has been programmed to do so. But the concept of artificial intelligence is a tricky one, but based on what I have studied we are still quite a way from creating a "true" AI.
What´s the complication with them having Con scores? Like I said, stop thinking of the droid creation rules when creating a Shard character, and just create one as a regular character and it all falls into place. It took me a while to realize this, but I think that was how they always intended people to do it.

Agreed. The more I think about it, the more this just makes sense. Well done sir! <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
And thanks for those notes on Mechu-Deru, I'm sure I'll find a use for them somewhere... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
