# Dawn of Defiance

### **Avarna** (2009-06-29 22:26:42)

I know we already have two games that are following the Dawn of Defiance campaign on the site, Along with the one that Alicia is running on ORPG.
So my question is: Do we have players who aren't already in one of the other games, and if so how many are interested in playing it?

As you know, I'm already in one. But I'm interested enough to try a different sort of character, with a different GM. That is, if your taking people already in a different game.

This would be good for some of our newest players, Ava. Maybe you could extend them a hand of gamer-ship?

### **Avarna** (2009-06-30 10:22:23)

Yes, I'd be willing to run it, if I have enough interest. So hopefully the new players will post here if they're interested

Would you be starting at the start or at a later part?
Would probably be beneficial for me to participate in a game

I would put it up to a vote: DoD rules do allow for skipping the first mod and starting with the second.
Of course you'd be welcome to play Thraken.

Kk, I don't mind either really <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Count me in.

Hey, I'm always interested, honestly.
And I'm trying to recruit some more folks to the website.
But count just me for now.

A good (or even reasonable) campaign never has a limit. There *is* interest here, certainly.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-07-05 01:06:58)

Yes, and the casting call is still open, if your interested.

I'm very new to the site (in fact, this is my first post), but I'd love to join a game following this campaign.

---

### **Avarna** (2009-07-12 17:20:44)

When games are recruiting they open a Casting Call.
I'm afraid I'm not looking for players at the moment.

OK, thanks for the information.
