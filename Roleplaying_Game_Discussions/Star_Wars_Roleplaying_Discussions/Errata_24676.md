# Errata?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-06-02 08:03:48)

I just noticed something. Wizards have taken down their Star Wars site. Which means that all the errata and Jedi Counsellings are seemingly unavailable. I noticed that Alicia had some resources on her page, but IÂ´m still missing most of the errata.
Anyone know anything about where it could be find?

I didn't get the errata combined into one, though I have them on the pdf copies of the books. Supposedly they will be re-released on the wizards forum. We just have to wait for them. Till then I can attempt to take them out of the books and combine them into the SE Errata pdf I started.
In case anyone is interested. I do have pdf versions of all the Web Enhancements in my file repository: <!-- m -->[http://swrpgrc.com/files](http://swrpgrc.com/files "http://swrpgrc.com/files")<!-- m -->
DA, I had an updated version of Jedi Counseling I didn't have up. All of the JC up to 115 is now up on there.
