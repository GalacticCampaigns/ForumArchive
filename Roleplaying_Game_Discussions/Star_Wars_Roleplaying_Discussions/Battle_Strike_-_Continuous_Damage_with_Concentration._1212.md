# Battle Strike - Continuous Damage with Concentration.

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-16 18:41:43)

I'm allowing my players to use a standard action to concentrate on battle strike to do continuous increased damage, what do you think?
The reasoning behind,
Qui Gon using his lightsaber to damage the blast door on the Trade Federation Control Ship.
It an action basically used to damage stationary objects.

hmmm could you still be able to attack with this ruling?

There seems to be nothing built into the rule to prevent that (and it's a mistake to rely on roleplayer's common sense!)
Note that it shouldn't be applicable in combat, because Battle Strike isn't an attack, it just increases the power of your *next* attack. Since multiple instances of the same type of effect never stack, continuously using Battle Strike then unleashing it all in an attack would only have the effect of the original Battle Strike. Wasteful, no?
However, the original design choice behind it is actually intriguing. It *is* a good way to model that scene with Qui-Gon cutting through the door. It basically counts as a single albeit extended attack, so I see no reason not to let Battle Strike's effects extend to the whole attack. Just make sure to prepare for the inevitable moment someone tries to abuse this.

Maybe the lightsaber going through DR is enough. I just figure if you can concentrate on move object and force grip that maybe you should be able to concentrate on battle strike.
In combat against opponents you couldn't use it, but in stationary objects you could.
When you say could you still attack I'm not sure if your saying could you attack while concentrating. The answer is no, because it take a standard action to attack. Your attack is on the object you are concentrating on, you wouldn't need to roll to hit and you would just deal damage.
Maybe it should be a Full-Round Action instead of a standard action, but you get the idea.
How it would work is you use the battle strike as normal, then the following round you would normally loose battle strike, but with my modified rule you could continue to damage a stationary object using a standard action. So, the only thing you could do is damage the object.

this was what I meant. I wasnÂ´t sure if you meant that you should be able to attack while concentrating

I should go on to say, while you are doing this you can not use block or deflect, but if we adopted [Project Projectile](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=111 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=111") as discussed in the previous topic you would be able to do that.

Of course there is another way to model Qui-gon cutting through that set of doors. No roll to hit, it's large and stationary. Just apply the lightsaber's damage (up to you wether to roll or just take maximum damage) per round bypassing it's DR after the first round of damage. Nothing more really required there except to make sure to mention that Qui-gon is 'helpless' for as long as he continues the cutting.

Totally agree. QG doesn't need battle strike to cut through a door with essentially a fancy cutting torch. I wouldn't even rule cutting through the door an attack so much as a full round action that ties up his weapon and concentration.
Can battle strike can be used on immovable objects? Sure. A jedi should be able to do extra damage in an attack, especially against non-moving targets like cannons, stationary vehicles, etc.
I'd rule that battle strike shouldn't be carried over to new rounds. Beyond the opportunity for major abuse by players, I'd say it doesn't really reflect the nature of the power. If you do allow it, it should cost. Say, a force point per round. That should prevent abuse and still allow it for dire circumstances.

Okay thanks guys, I was just looking to see if the base powers could be creatively used. The bypass DR of the lightsaber I think could easily replicate the effect also.
After considering your posts I have decided not to use my idea.
