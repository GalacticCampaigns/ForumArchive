# So how many Jedi screamed at once?

The new [Errata](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/sagaederrata "http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/sagaederrata") has came out yesterday :P.
In particular
Force Point Recovery can only be taken once
Fools Luck is now a competence bonus so doesn't stack with skill focus
Serenity makes you helpless and unable to tack actions now when used in combat :P
Recovering your force powers on a UTF check of 20 now only apply to activating power not any UTF check.

I didn't like the Force Point Recovery errata... The others are necessary in my opinion.

To add to the above Acrobatic Strike went from a +5 Unnamed Bonus to +2 Competence Bonus.

All the changes seems fair to me, except that I think the limit on FPR waas unnecessary, especially now since there has been added so many other Force Techniques worth taking.

I have to agree on that. I may have to institute a House Rule to ignore that rule if and when my players decided to take multiple uses of it.
I had never really had any problems with what was changed but I can see why it was.

Over all i think the eratta was well done.

Previously what made Acrobatic Strike broken was that it can be combined with Powerful Charge, and Power Attack for brokenness.
Tumble back 3 squares for 5 bonus to hit, charge with powerful charge for additional +4 to hit. So someone now can power attack for 9 and with a two handed weapon you'll basically be able to do a 18 dmg + 1/2 dmg per level + 1/2 dmg per level for just -2 Ref.
With Errata charge and acrobatic strike is a competence bonus so they no longer stack. But you can still withdraw and charge every round, but now you're only getting +8 dmg +1/2 Dmg per level +1/2 dmg per level for -2 Ref.

What? I never used that brokenness ask Alicia, Tanya never combined acrobatic strike with either powerful charge or power attack.
