# Legacy Campaign Guide

Anyone got it yet? One or two have got it over on the Wizards boards.
I want to get it but I might not be able to for some time. I'll have to start searching for the special file again.

### **master_Tru** (2009-03-12 07:37:14)

Not yet but I was going to order it soon.

### **Sketchpad** (2009-03-13 08:31:03)

Haven't seen it yet myself ... I went up to Borders (who are notorious for getting it SWSE books early), but they haven't received it here yet either. I think this may be one book I may hold off a bit on, as I'm not sure how much I'd use it. In the long run, I'd like to snag it, but between looking at 4th ed D&D, playing M&M, True20 & SWSE, may have to slow down a bit <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

M&M now there is a game system I would like to try. I have had no luck getting the legacy book yet, off to another store.

I may be tempted to start up a M&M PbP in the near future ... Pretty sure I may do it on the Atomic Think Tank, but I'm open to suggestions ...

I...think I'm done buying Saga books. It's not what I'm looking for, I guess. At least, not enough to spend money on. But, I might just pick up Legacy for the source material. I loved what I saw in the comic.
M&M is a good game. I've played it, but haven't gotten anywhere running a game. I can't get my head to accept the power limits.

What's an Atomic Think Tank? Sounds like a Brain-in-the-Jar with one hell of a shelf/half life.

Atomic Think Tank is simply the bomb! Its a forum site used to support the M&M gaming system and wow is it ever supported. There is a lot of information on that site just scanning through it takes some time and I have seen some really good stuff.
Oh and Sketchpad this site can be used to run non star wars games for those interested we tried 4th edition DnD it just never took off on this site but its possible another system/setting could find ground here.

It's the Mutants & Masterminds community that can be found [here](http://www.atomicthinktank.com/ "http://www.atomicthinktank.com/").

I am actually thinking about regressing a little, and heading back to d6 system. I played that recently, and I liked it. And they came out with a "new" d6 system that's a little cleaner than the last one.

Would you be hosting that here? I'd be interested.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-03-16 23:25:58)

...not...as...yet. I'm deployed, so life is restricted, and that would slow posting...
But, I haven't gamed for months. Bored...maybe. I have to think on plots, and see where that goes.

Well it's ordered. Should have it mid to late next week.

### **Sketchpad** (2009-03-24 23:32:42)

So I got a look at the Legacy book ... man is it sweet! I never was a big fan of the Vong Invasion stuff and only read a few issues of Legacy here and there ... but there are some fun rules in it! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Anonymous** (2009-03-25 16:14:57)

It finally arrived at my bookstore, so I could take a look at it. While it's got some useful stuff, I'm not going to be playing in the Legacy era anytime soon, so I'm gonna have to pass. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> This way I'll have no problem when the Rebellion era book comes out. Money is just too tight to get something I really am not going to use much.

### **Yogi** (2009-03-25 16:46:41)

It arrived a day early. My wife will probably hold it for ransom.

~snicker~ Question is ... what will she want for it, Yogi? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

That is the million dollar question.

What's in the book, rules-wise? I'm not really interested in Legacy, at least the fluff.
