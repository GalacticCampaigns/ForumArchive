My mind drifts once again - I'm wondering if anyone has come across a d20 modern conversion of Saga edition?

No I haven't. but it should be easy enough to do. Most of the rules for D20 are easily applied to Saga, One of the biggest things is to convert the skills over to the more simplified version used with Saga.
