From the video of the Old Republic, the female Jedi (forgot her name lol) blocks Malgus' lightsaber with just her hands...what feat/talent/skill would this fall under to use in the RP?

Negate energy came to mind. Bit of descriptive text and she's blocking with her hands.

I agree with Alicia that Negate Energy would be my first choice for an ability.
Other abilities I might consider using are DR 10 (Talent, Core), Force Shield (Force Power, TFU), Energy Resistance (Force Power, KOTOR). There might be more out there, but Negate Energy is th one I´d go with.
Her name is Satele Shan, btw.

Force Shield I always attributes to more telekinetic ability than anything. From a mechanics point of view most of the abilities you mentioned have to be set up in advanced and don't have the reaction aspect exhibited in the trailer.

As the books stand today I would have to agree that Negate energy is the most likely in this case. Though with new fan swag coming out like the Star Wars MMO game then there is a possibility for new source book(s) to hit store shelves as well, with new talents/skills/feats within.

Like I said, I absolutely agree with you that Negate Energy would be my first choice. Basically I was just stretching my mind to try and find some alternatives to choose from.
I find Force Shield plausible, as there is no absolute description of exactly how the "bubble" around you is shaped, or even if it´s visible. If Satele has DR 10, I could easily see her activating it before going head-to-head with Malgus. Same thing with Energy Resistance, which can be maintained as a Swift action.

Primitive Block + Empowered Combat Gloves. Or a cortosis gauntlet, reworked flavor-wise to not be cortosis. Or the Martial Artist's version of Block, forget what its called, but the rules say nothing about 'doesn't work against lightsabers'. really just depends on the character in question.
any of the above are a whole lotta work for one not often used ability, so negate energy is the best bet though. martial artist's is next best if playing a non-force sensitive and getting to close to Forcies.
