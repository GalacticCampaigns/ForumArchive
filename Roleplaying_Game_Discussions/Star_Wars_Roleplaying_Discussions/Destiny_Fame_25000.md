# Destiny: Fame?

### **BWS2K** (2011-03-15 17:28:33)

Is there such a thing as a **Fame** Destiny? I've looked at the OmegaDex and it doesn't look promising. Maybe something like **Champion**ish? I'm making a character for potential use in the *Arena*, but I'll probably be using him in my Unleashed campaign anyway. Suggestions?
Thanks!

A destiny to become famous? Not that I can think of.
Personally, I´d say attaining fame doesn´t really qualify among the other things that you have to do to fulfill your destiny. Saving the Galaxy and training the guy who does it is one thing, but given how easy fame can be to obtain (seriously, some of the most famous people, have they ever done something valuable? Or even done something?) I don´t see it as qualifying. Besides, you´re quite likely to gain some fame by accomplishing another destiny anyway.

Well said. After thinking about it for awhile I came to the same conclusions - you become famous for something you did or are planning on doing. I'm trying to make a recurring lower-level character bent on "being the best" at all costs. A **Corruption** Destiny will actually work out alright, as the character becomes more and more single-minded and corrupt himself. Maybe even have him helping the PCs at first, then later he can totally lose it and go postal.
Thanks!
