It seems nice, but is it anyone else who wants to throw up at the thought of a lightsaber crystal that makes you better at persuasion?

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-08 06:13:02)

Nope. Just you, Anthrax. The rest of us are fine with universal law breaking fun!

I'd say blame the guy at Bioware who decided that pontites gave a CHA bonus and wrote a description saying it soothed tempers or something. Because of its inclusion in KOTOR it makes it the most commonly known description of pontites.
It also gives them an escape route from creating yet another more powerful lightsaber crystal.

IÂ´m not opposed to fun, just to stuff that donÂ´t make any sense <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Bah on making sense! Since when does sense matter? Screw the laws of physics! Screw common sense! GIVE ME SITH LORDS WHO BLOW UP STAR SYSTEMS FOR KICKS AND ARE UNDEAD!

Good to see there'll be ten new force traditions.

Intimidate is a kind of persuasion...

Intimidate is a kind of persuasion...
I agree, but I donÂ´t find the below a representation of using a lightsaber to intimidate.

I strongly agree that a lightsaber can be very intimidating (see my custom Form 0 talent), but this is not it. And just on a side note, IÂ´ve never heard that Pontite crystals should have an effect like this. IIRC there is one crystal that has some kind of sonic properties though.

Okay, I was wrong before. Blame the *Obsidian* guy that thought making pontites into an endothermic moodstone was a good idea.

IÂ´ve got the book now, and I have to say I really like it. Not unexpected, a lot of the "crunch" doesnÂ´t fit well with me (like a lot of the lightsaber crystals or some Force Powers), but that crap IÂ´ll just houserule.
My biggest joy from this book probably has to be the Lightsaber Form powers, they are just great. Several of the new talents and Force Traditions look great as well, as well as the Force Regimens. I canÂ´t wait to get into a game where I can try it out.

### **Thraken** (2009-05-31 08:26:32)

Oi, when some of the games finish my campaign will be spamming this book real good :P

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-31 09:41:19)

Can't wait for the next one. When is it suppose to come out?

---

### **Thraken** (2009-05-31 10:05:00)

June or July (can't remember) there's a Rebellion campaign guide.
After that it seems to be more class based books. i.e. Soldier Noble and Scout based books. Similar to Scum and Villainy for scoundrels and Jedi Academy for jedi.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-05-31 12:02:34)

The next one IÂ´m looking really forward to is the droid book.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-05-31 12:37:59)

Huh, forgot about that. Not that high a priority - but I suppose actual droid creation rules will be good.
What about rules for ground vehicles however? <!-- s:/ -->![:/](https://i.ibb.co/1fht9Fjq/icon-mad.gif)<!-- s:/ -->
