After a lengthy evaluation, Wizards of the Coast has decided not to renew the Star Wars license with Lucasfilm. We’ve had a long and fantastic run, but with the economic downturn, we have made the tough decision to discontinue our Star Wars lines.

This week, we released The Dark Times minis and Galaxy of Intrigue RPG. We’ll have more coming with Masters of the Force minis in April, which will have some of your most favorite characters along with rare creatures from the Dejarik Holochess game that have never appeared in our game. We’ll also release The Unknown Regions RPG in April, which includes entirely new planets and mini-adventures for each world.
> We are finishing the line with a bang so look for special programs at your local game store to stock up on favorite sets before they go into the vault. We will continue to support our Star Wars forums on the Wizards Community site so you can reach out and chat with us and other fans.
> While I know the news is disappointing, we wanted to make this announcement as soon as possible and thank you for being such great fans. It’s been a fantastic ride with the Star Wars community and working with Lucasfilm. We hope you enjoy the next several months of great products. You never know when we may circle back again!

Not surprised that Saga is out of the running, but didn't expect them not to renew their license with Lucas completely.

Well, we figured this was going to happen. Now I just have to find as many of the old minis as possible before they wind up on E-BAY. Oy. <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

If they're going blame the economic downturn, then it makes sense to cancel saga. Since the Licensing rights are probably the biggest expense when it comes to producing Saga.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-01-29 11:27:58)

Ah well, not at all surprised. I expect this is more of a disappointment to Minis players.

### **Anonymous** (2010-01-31 10:15:10)

I'm so glad I've kept up with the books and don't need minis. Digital maps and all. Althought, I should admit that when I'd heard this on Order 66, I almost thought I'd want to go ahead and buy minis, but I don't have the storage space for that. :P
Bummer, but I'm kind of glad to not have too many more books to buy.

Easy for you guys to say. I've still only got five books and no money to buy more with. -_-' Ah well, they'll probably still be available on Amazon and such at least for a little while.

More than me, mate. I wouldn't worry about it, they're quite likely to do another printing before the license runs out and the demand can't be so high they'll all be snapped up.

When some people started freaking out about this on the WOTC board months ago when the "upcoming releases" list stopped growing, I told them that there were two plans we would need to implement, depending on what WOTC did:
If they published more books, we keep playing Saga.
If they don't publish more books, we keep playing Saga.
Lather, rinse, repeat.

That pretty much covers it. We just keep playing.

Hear hear!
It'll be interesting to see if homebrew stuff goes on the rise as part of the aftermath.

Well, there's always the Star Wars Adventure Writer's Guild. On top of that I'm sure we can play test some player made stuff here. Isn't that part of the fun of a huge network? Someone comes up with something, and play tests it. I mean, when I was trying to write my Teepo Paladin Tree, Darth Anthrax gave me a lot of good advice. I just haven't tried it out yet.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-02-02 17:38:42)

I´m a bit preoccupied with another project at the moment (namely adapting the Saga rules for use in a fantasy setting), but I´m sure I´ll at least have lots of ideas for new stuff that I might make something more of.

Wow! I'm not surprised really. I was out of the loop and just found out about this. Kinda sad to see the support end but I also understand why they did it. I would imagine we will see an influx of homebrew material however.
I do think they have pretty much made every book they could. I don't have every book but at least now I might be able to catch up, lol.

Good luck in catching up. Many of them have been out of print for a year or so.

Gah! I hope I have the ones that are out of print. I think I'm only missing the last 3? Gotta check to make sure lol.

### **Anonymous** (2010-03-26 20:16:06)

You'd better hurry up there on catching up. I'm glad that I managed to keep up this time. Fortunately, my FLGS has me on a call list for all Star Wars material. I'll get a call the minute it comes in and go pick up the last book and have the complete set.
YAY!

Thats pretty awesome. I wish there was something like that near me. Closest gaming store to me is ruffly 1-2 hours away. I just usually get the books at the closest Books-a-Million, and thats a 45 minute drive in its self.
