# Balosar Stats?

### **Valheru** (2008-12-03 04:57:39)

I haven't gotten my copy of Scum and Villainy yet (I decided to wait for Christmas <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->) but I've heard it contains stats for Balosar. Does anyone mind posting them for me?

I don't have it, but I'll give you fair warning that posting anything official *could be* a violation of copyrights. Considering how much Rowan has put into this little site, I would hazard to say he's not interested in getting it yanked from him.
As far as I know, everything on this site is a bunch of homebrew, including a fair bit of alteration of the "official" stuff.
Then again, I might be out in left field.

Yes, unfortunately posting the stats is against the copywrite. You can make general comments about the stats but post a full stat block would indeed be a no-no.
I've tried looking for a conversion for you on the web with no luck. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->

Ah, sorry, wasn't trying to get anybody in trouble. :
Thanks for looking Rowen, I've had no luck either.

The Balosar has been converted! I converted it using GM Sarli's conversion guide. You can find in on the main page of this site. Just click the 'Saga Conversions' link on the top menu bar and follow the links from there. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Hey, cool!  I like how you listed all the species in one place, along with their books and page numbers.  That's awesome.  It'll be nice to not have to flip through all my books, thinking, "Where was that species listed, again?"
Oh, and about the Balosar stats.  There are no Fortitude saves in Saga.  It's Fortitude Defense now.  And (you know how I can be picky about these things) Saga uses a progression of +1, +2, +5, +10 for modifiers (not the even numbers from the RCR), so the bonuses should be a +5, methinks.  All in all, though, not bad.

Damnit I messed up again. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->  Sorry guys.....Ill fix it then.  <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Okay in looking at the conversion guide again I didn't see where they say anything about adjusting the modifiers. Just curious where you got your intel from, I'm a stickler for the rules at times lol.

It doesn't actually say that in the conversion guide, or anywhere else that I can find.  But almost everywhere they list modifiers in the books (with the notable exception of ability mods) they go 1, 2, 5, 10 (and every five after that).  Just look at the condition track penalties (p. 149) and the feats (which always hand out bonuses and penalties with those numbers).
So, it's really more of an assumption, but that's how they seem to do things.

### **Rowen** (2009-01-09 11:29:38)

Okay, I've made the corrections. Look over it and see if it looks right this time.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-09 16:20:33)

Looks good.  I don't know if the Fortitude bonus should be a +5 or not. It probably should be, judging by how they handle everything else, but I could be wrong about that.

### **Rowen** (2009-01-11 13:50:19)

I didn't realize it but the Balosar stats are in the Scum and Villainy book, page 154. So I've updated that entry to reflect that.

### **Anonymous** (2009-01-11 15:36:31)

Yeah, Valheru said that in the opening post, but I thought you were doing a conversion so he could have the stats since he didn't have the book.  Anyway, he said he was waiting for Christmas to get the book, so he should have it now and the point is kinda moot.
