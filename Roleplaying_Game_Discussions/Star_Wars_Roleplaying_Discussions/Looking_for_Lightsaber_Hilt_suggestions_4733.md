# Looking for Lightsaber Hilt suggestions?

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 05:30:14)

I can PM you a link to a site that has some images of cool saber hilts, but I wont post the link here as it's a commercial site that makes prop hilts for sale. PM me if you're interested. I use the hilt images for some of my characters.

Ya PM me the link, It can't hurt to take a look. Some times images are cool for players to look at in game. Kinda like equipment cards <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

PMed!

I'd like it too, though I'm not understanding why you just don't post the link? If it's a commercial site, maybe the guy would at least like the thought of potential customers? URLs aren't private information, after all...

PMed!
Forum rules specifically request that people don't market/sell products here. I had originally posted the link, but I thought better of it when I remembered the forum rules. Until a moderator comes into this thread and tells me it's okay, I'll distribute the link this way.

Hm, ok. I think Rowen, Tru, and/or Scribed will be ok with it, but you gotta be on the safe side, I guess.

It's not so much a "safe side" thing as a respect thing. Until such time as I'm expressly told that it's okay, it seems only respectful not to post something that might violate the rules, even if I don't intend to violate the rules. It also helps me to buildup a little goodwill, so that I'll be believed that I've made an honest error if I do happen to make an error in the future.

I don't see a problem with it. You're not trying to sell a product, just provide a reference. Also, it's honestly ok to provide a link to a product on the strength that you like that product, provided your post is an honest review by a pleased customer/fan rather than a marketing strategy.
Of course, Rowen is the ultimate power at this forum and his opinion may differ from mine, but you should be safe to post the link until such a time as he says otherwise (Now I've ok'd it I'm the one who'll get reprimanded, not you).

Okay then, thank you. Here's the link:
<!-- m -->[http://www.randomsabers.com/](http://www.randomsabers.com/ "http://www.randomsabers.com/")<!-- m -->
Note that I'm not trying to sell you anything. I provide the link purely to help you (the player) add a little more depth to your Jedi character by being able to provide a link to the image of his/her/it's lightsaber hilt.

### **Rowen** (2007-12-18 23:31:06)

Nah, Im cool with the link. Like Simply said, your not selling/marketing stuff, just providing a reference. This is okay. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Its an interesting site as well.

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-19 02:14:08)

Interesting site, but it's almost too much of a choice. It's like almost the ultimate dilemma <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Some of the sites I frequent have a much less liberal policy concerning to links to commercial sites, so I thought I'd be sure.

Well whaddaya know, I was right.
TCMB: We're a small enough community right now that it's really easy to police that kind of thing. If we ever grew large enough where the admin staff couldn't handle the volume of posts, then we might have to be stricter. Probably won't happen though, because if if it gets to that point I imagine we'd promote a few members to mod status.

I know how it is. One IRC chat I frequented autobanned anyone who posted a link PERIOD, even if it was a link from the hosting site.

I still figured that it would only be polite to err on the side of caution. I did post the link after you told me it's be okay.

None of the sites I go to are THAT bad, thank the Internet Gods. But they do take a dim view.
