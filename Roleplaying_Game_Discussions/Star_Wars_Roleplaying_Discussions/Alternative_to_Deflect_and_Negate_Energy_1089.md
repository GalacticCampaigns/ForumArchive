# Alternative to Deflect and Negate Energy?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-13 17:23:34)

I came up with an idea for using the Force that I though I might share with the rest of the forums.
What if a Force-user tried to block an incoming shot with another object, sending it to intercept the shot with the Force? I canÂ´t recall anywhere IÂ´ve seen or read this being done, but I thought directly of a scene in *X-Men III* where Magneto uses cars to stop bullets shot at him.
If you even think this should be able to do, how would you then go about doing it mechanically? This is just a very quick, raw solution I came up with: Make a UtF check to activate one of the avaible method for telekinetically moving objects (*Move Light Object* and *Move Object*), and compare it to the attack roll of the incoming attack. If you beat the atack roll, you sucessfully intercept the shot with the object, and if the object can take at least half the damage of the attack before being destroyed, it will stop the attack. Otherwise nothing happends. For slugthrowers and simple/primitive weapons it must only be able to absorb one quarter of the damage.
Thoughts? I think this could be at least reasonably balanced, given the limits on its use, and the need to actually have an object ready

Good Topic.
I see magneto using his abilities to give everyone total cover causing the attacks to hit the DR of the cars and just ping off.
What you are describing is extremely powerful. You have to realize that you can potentially block an attack that targets anyone near you; not just yourself. It let's you block an attack against an ally from far away. Block and Deflect can at most defend an adjacent ally only after spending a force point with an ignited lightsaber in hand.
Using the force to move an object to intercept an attack.
Mechanically you would need Quicken Power (Move Object) and you would have to spend a destiny point. This will allow you to use Move Object as reaction.
You could use the rules on pg 151 for Attacking an Object, but the rules don't seem to work well, because when your deflecting/Blocking using your lightsaber you don't add the size modifier of the projectile to your DC. It would be impossible to do.
Since your being attacked, I would just use the normal deflect/block rules to complete this action. You might even give a -5 penalty for using a an awkward weapon to deflect/block the attack.
If you didn't have all those fancy powers. I would allow a player accomplish the same feat with a readied action.
If you ready your action to move light object or move object against an attack, at you or an ally, I would allow it.
Spend a force point, and resolve it as a normal deflect/block. If the player spent a destiny point instead you might consider letting them pick up multiple objects or one bigger object one size category to use against the attack granting a greater DR and better chance at taking no damage.
If the object takes damage and it does not destroy the object it would be deflected. By chance the object is destroyed any remaining damage would be dealt to its original target.
I'm just going by the book and utilizing the rules to make it happen. Of course you can create a for talent to allow such an ability. You might think that spending a force point is too much and consider to let them resolve the action without spending a force point.
This is just how I would address it in my campaign.
I had a player that wanted to react to a grenade being tossed at him, but he didn't ready his action. It kinda has the same problem, should we let our players use Move Light Object or Move Object as a reaction. I say you have to ready, unless you have Qucken Move Object and spend a destiny point.
Here's one I would like to talk about but I running out of time...
Using the force to block an incoming non-energy attack with no object.
I would like someone do this one. We see it in the clone wars cartoons when Obi-Wan blocks the incoming slugs.
If you think about it he is using the force to block as a reaction. There must be some sort of penalty or maybe a talent or feat.

I didnÂ´t write anything on that, but obviosly a penalty should be in place for using it to shield someone else, -10 for an adjacent ally, and maybe -5 for every meter over that? makes it neraly useless to protect someone other than yourself or a person near you.

Ah yes, it should definitly require readying an action or using Quicken Power.

Agreed, such actions should always have to be readied, unless you have a legitimate way of getting them to be a reaction. And by applying cumulative penalties (like Block/Deflect), it would most likely be a very sparsely used ability.

ThatÂ´s actually something interesting. I donÂ´t have any good answers for this, except possibly a cool visual representation of DR 10 talent, where all the slug failed to bypass it <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->
Or maybe a Move Object using a Force Point could be made to move a lot of smaller ones, relative to the size difference (1 Large = hundreds of diminuitve)

The Zeison Sha are capable of doing this. In my force tradition write-up, I basically altered Deflect for flavour and said it used objects from the vicinity rather than a lightsaber. Which, basically, is all it is.
**Intercept Projectileâ€”**As a reaction, you can intercept ranged attacks with loose objects available in the immediate area. Make a Use the Force check to negate the attack. The DC is equal to the attack roll, and you take a -5 cumulative penalty for every time you have already used Intercept Projectile since the beginning of your last turn. You can intercept some of the barrage of shots from autofire weapons. If you succeed on your check, you take half damage if the attack hits and no damage if it misses. This talent has no effect on other area attacks (such as grenades, missiles, and flamethrowers). There must be loose objects of some kind in the area for you to use this talent. There are loose objects in the area if the GM says there are, or if you make a compelling case for why there should be ("I'm at the bottom of a canyon, right? There must be some rocks around."; "Well I'm in an office, so why can't I pull out desk drawers and use them to intercept the attacks?")

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-15 10:43:22)

thatÂ´s a good representation. But I was thinking of maybe having a rule that said wether a object was useable in this way or not. For instance in your example, I donÂ´t see desk drawers offering much protection against a blaster rifle

The blaster bolt hits them, deflecting off or vaporising them but not passing through, or whatever. Bear in mind that in Star Wars desks are undoubtedly made of metal or some other resistant material rather than wood. The power also doesn't rule out the use of more than one obstacle, so you could put several rocks/drawers/etc between you and the oncoming fire if you didn't think a single target would withstand it. It's all down to cinematic description.
As for a rule about what can and can't be used to deflect - A little over-involved and complex for Saga, don't you think? This is the system that simplified cover, after all.

yeah I know desk drawers arenÂ´t made of wood, but I just figured Blaster Rifles were a little more powerful than that. The way I suggested it may be a little overly complex, but I was actually thinking it could be useful against larger weapons as well. like ripping away a to deflect a tank blast or so...would make for a good epic feel

The Magneto Effect (hehe)
Using an object as cover could work well, without having to create a new force talent. If you readied an action, or had the quicken power to use it in time. If the object is big enough and can provide total cover it would protect you. The attack would have to destroy the object being used as the shield. If the object is destroyed any remaining damage would hit its original target.
The key in this tactic is being able to move an object large enough and in time, and the object has to be big enough to provide total cover.
If perhaps you moved an object not large enough to provide total cover you could say it provides cover +5 to Ref Defense ( as long as you are not receiving cover already, or maybe improved cover granting a +5 even when you have cover), and that might be the edge you needed to avoid the attack.
As long as you or your ally is within 6 squares which is the range of Move Object, then you should not give any penalties, but maybe if you want to allow this power to be used at greater ranges, allow the Jedi to spend a force point and take range penalties. -5 for each additional range increment of 6.

Well, then see the bit where I said you could use multiple objects to block a single attack. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I wouldn't allow that in my games. The bigger the object (and the harder it is to lift/pull away from the surface) = the more exerting to move it with the force. It may well be possible to move, but not in the very short space of time between your enemy pulling the trigger and the blaster bolt hitting you.

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-15 18:15:29)

I don't see anything wrong with ripping off an object as long as you can roll the DC for the size. Size matters not. If I was running I would not let them use this at a range more than 6 squares, and it would be as I said above. You would use the object as a shield providing cover, improved cover, or total cover depending on the size of the object Also, it would have to be a readied action, unless the Jedi had quicken power (move object).

Size does matter, no matter what Yoda said. Yes the Force has power that far exceeds the limitations of his own body, but lifting an X-Wing is still harder than lifting a pebble. The bigger the object, the more concentration is required. The more concentration that is required, the longer it takes to centre yourself. The longer it takes to centre yourself, the longer it takes to move your object. This is especially true of any object that is attached to a surface and requires "ripping away". More resistance requires the application of more force (Or, in this case, "Force"). Note how long it took Yoda to get the X-Wing out of the swamp (and remember that a combat round is 6 seconds). That pretty much rules out big objects for defensive purposes, in my mind.
Well sure, you can do it per the rules if you use Move Object - But you need to ready an action, which makes Move Object a sub par choice in the defensive repertoire because it's often difficult to predict attacks and many players wouldn't want to throw away a standard action. If the ability to use items defensively is to be a part of the game that will actually get used frequently, I think it needs to have its own mechanic which allows it to be used as a reaction, such as the talent I designed or an alternative force power. Since that mechanic, whatever it may be, is usable as a reaction, which requires split-second timing, I wouldn't allow it to lift large, heavy items.

Ah, thereÂ´s something of what I imagined. This of course should not be a primary method of defense, but rather a last defense option, either requiring a readied action or the use of Quicken Power. It could be useful if you need to buy a few precious moments to recover or to cover an escape or for a jedi thatÂ´s lost his lightsaber

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-16 05:53:44)

I agree that the big objects for this action is a bit much.
I have an idea..
I'm all for making new talents and feats, and I'm not knocking your talent. I think its great, but If I were to adopt it in my campaign I would modify it a little bit. It seems that if you can deflect incoming attacks against you and your companions 12 squares away with a any hard loose light object in your environment or maybe even something you carry on you is a bit much for one talent.
I'm not sure if your Intercept Projectile ability is a talent or force technique. Again if I adopted your idea I would make it a force technique since it puts it more par with Quicken Power and its so specific that it makes sense. Quicken Power could be for anything, so they had to put the limitations on spending a destiny to make it a reaction.
Force Technique:
**Intercept Projectile:** Reaction, Make a Use the Force check, if you beat your opponents attack roll you intercept the attack with a nearby loose light object. Take a -5 penalty to your Use the Force check for each time you have used Intercept Projectile, Block, or Deflect since the beginning of your last turn. If you make a successful Use the Force check against an area attack, such as auto fire, take 1/2 damage. You can deflect attacks targeting you or your allies within 6 squares of the object being used to deflect the attack. The object can not be more then 6 squares from you and you can not move the object more than 6 squares to deflect the attack.
I didn't mean to butcher your idea, but I like it and I would use it like this.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-16 06:43:58)

okay, maybe itÂ´s just me, but I like the idea of being able to use larger objects as well. Of course, in proportion to ones power. Think of Palplatine in the Senate, he didnÂ´t seem to have any trouble at all flinging those pods around. Of course he is a level 20 character, but would it really be unreasonable for a character at say level 14-15 to be able to simply pull an object of similar size in front of him to intercept a blast from a battle tank or something?
To clarify my thinking of how this could be used IÂ´ll try to make an example:
You and your friend have infiltrated an imperial base and is discovered. Running, you are blocked by a locked door that now stands between you and your ship. Your friend, who is a skilled at this kind of thing, gets to work on the door when suddenly an AT-ST appears behind you. Your friend fails his check, and will need another round to try again. Next to you an object of some sort, say a generator is located.
What I proposes is that you (given you acts before the AT-ST in the coming round), can ready an action to use move object when the walker fires. When the walker fires, you makes your check to activate move object. given that you suceed on the check and is actually able to move an object of the appropriate size, your UtF check will now be compared to the attack roll of the AT-ST. If your roll is lower, you fail to intercept the attack and everything resolves normally. If your roll is higher though, the attack hits the object instead and damages the object. If the object is able to absorb more than half the attacks damage before being destroyed, you are shielded from the attack completely, otherwise, you take half damage. If the object is destoyed, it is destroyed. If it survives the attack, you could use another instance of move object (or maybe a Force Point) to keep it in place for the next round as well.
most objects would probably not be able to be used like this for long, and the cost for doing so is not something you would like to extend for long either. maybe its a little too complex for Saga, but I kind of like rules that are open-ended, so that you theoretically could scale them very high. but there should probably be a penalty to the UtF check in there somwhere as well.

Actually, I hadn't considered using it to defend others. Whoops, good eye. Personally I like the idea, and don't think it's too unbalanced because if you use your reaction to defend someone else you're probably getting hit yourself. I would consider leaving it as an option, but raising the penalty imposed for having used the ability before (this makes sense, as throwing an item at an incoming projectile is more involved than adjusting the position of your lightsaber). I will also need to put a range limit on it.
> I&#39;m not sure if your Intercept Projectile ability is a talent or force technique.

Quicken Power could be for anything, so they had to put the limitations on spending a destiny to make it a reaction.

It's a talent specific to the Zeison Sha talent tree, but if it were to become a regular use of force powers in my game I'd probably turn it into a Force Talent under the Alter Talent Tree.

This is a pretty good solution to the range issue. Looking at the other Force Techniques it does look like it should belong there... Zeison Sha could have access to it (or trimmed down version of it) early via their talent tree, while other force users need to take a prestige class to learn the ability.

This works, and I don't see what harm it would be to introduce the rule to your game. But for me as a GM, I don't think such a rule is strictly necessary - if a player wanted to do something like this I wouldn't be referencing rules anyway. This is a "heat of the moment" kind of scenario and action where you don't want to be flipping through books for the solution. I'd be likely to make a judgement call on how to resolve it then and there. It might not be as elegant as your solution but it would keep the game going and the excitement high.
A final thought: If you like rules to be open-ended, attempting to add more complexity to them is actually the opposite of what you want. They can already cover any situation you want them to, you just need to be receptive to cool ideas and willing to work with them. Further development only makes them more confining.

thanks for all the great input. I too would like to be without the need to look through books, thatÂ´s the reason I was trying to figure out how to handle it beforehand.
and by "open-ended", maybe I should have said "easy-to-continue-scaling". example: the battlemind skill from RCR. only statted to a certain DC, but with the given progression of bonus/DC, easy to scale to infinity if you would like to :
