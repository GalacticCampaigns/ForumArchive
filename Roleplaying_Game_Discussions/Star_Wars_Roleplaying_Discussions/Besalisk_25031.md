Gimme some opinions on this. This is not the Basilisk species mentioned along with the Mandalorians.
EDIT: Extra Reserves, Bonus Feat.

This needs to be a bit more specified, mainly if it means Con score or modifier. If it is modifier, then I guess it could be ok, though it seems odd that they can last without water and food equal times. If it is score, then it is extremely OP.

Not at all seeing the logic behind this, as Weapon Proficiency means knowing how to use the weapon, not being able to lift them. This is also especially true with Heavy Weapons, as they are often vehicle-mounted or requires tripods or other assistance to be used.
A suggestion would be to give the same bonus feat as Codru-Ji (Dual Weapon Mastery), though with their Dex penalty this might not be fitting. A more unique suggestion would be to say that due to their muscular build, they can wield a weapon up to two sizes larger than themselves if using all four arms at once.

Here I´d stick with the same as Codru-Ji: A +5 to Grab attacks. Actually much more useful.

If you look at the rule, its con score. Listed under Endurance. The other option here was Conditional Bonus Feat Skill Focus Endurance, which doesn't really make sense since its a natural thing, not generally being good at everything SF:E entails. I don't see the OP, cause there are so many species out there all ready who have better abilities, IE: Gen'Dai. I adapted this from the stat block I saw on a another site, where it was more realistic and seemed overly complicated. The food requirement was more like 4xCon.

You've got a point, I considered Pin for this, but Dual Weapon makes no sense at all. With the penalty its punishing the player. I also thought about a choice between Pin/Trip or Mighty Swing or maybe even Power Attack (though I changed my mind on Power Attack cause that could be broken easily). The only point I'll disagree with on the WP:H is the vehicle mount and tripod: their entire purpose is to support the weight. Could make it a Conditional, as in they can take WP:H if they have WP:R.

When ya think about it, no it isn't. The +5 to grab attacks is very limiting and only applies to the Grab Attack, not Grapple Attacks (unless there's a rule clarification I haven't seen) or opposed Grapple Checks.

RAW, its CON modifier days for food, and 3xCON score hours for water. I agree that SF:E don´t fit the bill, but I also wouldn´t count Gen'Dai as any indicator of what´s fair and balanced...that species was designed broken, so they had to make its stats broken to accurately represent it.
The Wookie entry for Besalisks says they can hold food and water for "many days", which is not a very accurate term. Still, if the above rule uses 2xCON score, then that´s 20 days minimum they can go without food an water. In most reasonable cases we´re probably looking at 24-28 days though (for scores of 12-14). It all depends on your pow of course, but "many" I´d say is at least a one-digit number. It may be a reasonable number for food (if want it to be very powerful), but going for ~1 month without water? Especially since they also have a boost to their Endurance skill.

I don´t think you should enter WPs into the equation at all. Multiple Limbs/Muscular Strength does nothing to give you new knowledge of how to use weapons. The ability to use two two-handed weapons at once is already great. With their Dex penalty it isn´t really fitting, but I fail to see how getting DWM for free is punishing the player, as DWM in itself gives you a very powerful option in combat, and is a prereq for some other nice abilities.
The other things you suggested might be decent, but they all hint that Besalisk are all adept wrestlers/close combatants. One thing that came to mind to me was the Multi-Grab feat, though that´s also Dex-based.

What I meant was that it is an ability that anyone can use, while only a small amount of characters gets any benefit from Grapple bonuses. Also (according to [the official FAQ compilation thread on WotC forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75862/19437134/Official_FAQ_Compilation_Thread "http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75862/19437134/Official_FAQ_Compilation_Thread")), the +5 would apply to the initial attack to start the grapple, though not to opposed Grapple checks.

On the food/water how bout i tweak it to read twice as long as other characters? That seems a bit better and sticks with the concept.
On the feat: the DW is punishing cause they take a penalty to dex. its saying hey, you can have this nifty feat after you waste lots of ability points and with the neg 2 they'll almost never qualify for DW III. I was looking for something else. Trip/Pin would be enough there though, so I'm gonna make it a choice between Trip/Pin because that represents the advantage of extra arms and have their own trees to work off of later, similar to DW.
That FAQ was one that I hadn't seen, but I didn't find anything in it to suggest that that +5 would go to grapple attacks. Either way, hitting with the grapple isn't as difficult as maintaining it and I wanted this species to be different from the Codru-Ji. i know its leaning towards them being some kinda wrestler species lol, but you've seen the movie. Dexter looked like he could put a hurting on a fella pretty easy if he got up close and personal.

I was actually going to suggest to simplify it to just two times the normal length, or three times, depending on how powerful you want it to be. That would allow even the weaker Besalisk to go without food and water for at least a couple of days, which is more than you can say about pretty much any species.
I see what you mean by punishing now, and I agree with you, even though I think DWM is generally a better representation of having multiple limbs. If you´re settled to go with either of those feats, I´d recommend you go with Pin. I don´t necessarily see multiple limbs helping with trip attacks, as opposed to pinning and opponent, and if you take it to the next level, it makes more sense with Crush than Throw.
If you do a search for "Grab" or "Grapple", you´ll reach a section where they explains pretty in detail how grappling actually works, and among other things they clarify that the initial attack for a grapple is a Grab attack. However, I can see the grapple check bonus working as well, though I just prefer to give out bonuses that all characters can use, not just a few.

this was why i stuck WP:H in there originally, as it is it's limiting the species to grapple builds. I'd rather give a choice between a grapple feat and something else, but nothing else seems to fit. Mighty Swing doesn't give the opportunities for continuance, and Power Attack for a species who can wield two large melee weapons simultaneously can get broken quickly. Most species only grant Core book feats, I may go through the other source books and look for something a little more flexible.
As for the Trip, knocking people down is all about leverage and center of gravity in my experience, and throws about that and a bit of brute strength. Seems like it would be much easier with an extra set of arms to me lol
