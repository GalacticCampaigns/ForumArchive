# Wealth vs Credits

### **chiech22** (2011-12-21 23:04:57)

Ok, so I came across this to determine a character's wealth at a given level:
Rodney Thompson posted:
As a very loose guideline, your wealth at any given level should be something like this: (level x [level -1]) x 2,000 credits*
* Double this for a noble with the Wealth talent.
This basically assumes that roughly 60% of your total income is spent on upkeep, paying rent, buying food, paying taxes, repairing equipment, getting medical care, etc. (This is a much higher rate than in D&D, where you'd only be expected to "burn" about 10% -- but D&D doesn't have an Imperial Revenue Service.)
For example, at 16th level, it should be somewhere around half a million credits.
The reason I say this is a very loose guideline, though, is that at least half of this wealth would tend to be in a non-liquid form (e.g. property, intangibles such as favors and allies, etc.). As a very rough guideline, having someone owe you a favor (i.e. one-time intervention on your behalf, not to exceed one encounter) is worth about 2,000 x CL; having a long-term ally (i.e. someone who will help you out any time they are available) is worth about 40,000 x CL x (% chance that they're available).
But that is wealth. How do you determine credits?

It depends on what the GM says. I've only been in a handful of games, but usually the GM will state in the *Casting Call* something that helps. My guess has always been you just do the same thing as for level one, but all of my characters had specifically instructed guidelines so it didn't matter. If you're asking about jaybee3's game, you can ask him. He writes in his CC for **Holocron Hunters**:
"*Take full credits each level for your class.*"
I understand that to mean if my first level is Jedi I take 1200c. If my second level was Scoundrel I'd take 3000c, for a total so far of 4200c. So on and so forth. The example you have from Rodney is, in my opinion, no more of a guideline than anything else - it depends on what your GM allows.
For **HH**: Since *Wealth* gives (5000c x Noble Level) x character level, it's best taken early on. If your first two levels are Noble and you have that talent, that means a whopping:
5000+10000+10000+10000+10000+10000+10000+10000=75000c
...even if you don't take any more levels in Noble - and that *doesn't* include the other class's credit totals. More than enough for some awesome tech and nice ship.
I could be wrong about any or all of that stuff though since I'm still relatively new to the SAGA system. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
