# 4e Eberron Interest

### **Sketchpad** (2009-09-01 20:53:57)

Heya Gang!
I'm looking at starting an Eberron campaign using 4e. I know there hasn't been an incredible track record here for 4e, but I'd like to give it a shot. Anyone interested? Should I post a Casting Call?

Hmm...don´t know the first thing about Eberron, but it would be nice to have at least one D&D running here. I´ll be in.

I am interested in a DnD style campaign. I just don't have any of the books or sources. If the campaign does get up and running I will see what I can do. I do have a bit of 3.5
