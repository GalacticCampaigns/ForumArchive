# M&M Interest Check

### **Sketchpad** (2009-09-01 20:56:09)

I'm also looking at starting a Mutants & Masterminds (2e) campaign in my own campaign universe. I know a few have been interested, but I'm trying to get an idea of a head count. The game uses your own heroes and is 4-color, non-camp in tone. Anyone interested?

I did not know we could do this here. I thought it was Star wars Only. Hmmm.....
I ran a Mutants and Masterminds PbP Game "Gotham Nights" on another board for a year, set in the Batman Animated Universe. I was just going through my old game folder and looking at all the old mapts, etc... Id love to get that started up again. Here is one of my old images.
