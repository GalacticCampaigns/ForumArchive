# Fantasy Interest Check

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-09 13:53:04)

As some of you might know, IÂ´ve been working on a Fantasy RPG system based upon and inspired by SAGA (and other sources as well), and IÂ´ve been planning to put some extra effort into it in a little while. Thus, IÂ´d like to check with people what they are interested in playing.
ThisÂ´ll hopefully give ideas on talents and feats to implement, PrCs, races, spells, weapons, and much more. You want a mount, animal companion or follower? Let me know. You want to lead great armies into war on large scale? IÂ´ll work on it.
Basically, just tell me what kind of character youÂ´d like to play in a Fantasy RPG. Use examples from books, movies, games or whatever, and express yourself in RPG terms (preferably then from SAGA) if you want to, IÂ´d like to get inspiration from all over.

**Artificer** - The technoGeek/Slave of the Fantasy realm. Gizmos & gadgets of all things etherial.
**Elementalist** with a side order of **summoner** - See Avatar the last airbender without the reliance on the elements actually being present ('cause I makes em!)
**TK** empowered **martial arts master** - yep
A **Ghost** - Hells yeah.
**A sentient weapon** - yep & I'll argue with ya too! (**WarForged**)
A shadow melding/controling **assasin** - C'mere Peter Pan, got something for ya. (See Naruto for some examples)

OK, let´s see what I can respond to this...
**Artificer** - Sure, I´ve decided to bring Gnomes into the world, so there should be room for a lot of that.
**Elementalist/Summoner** - Elemental magic will be its own skill, so I guess this can be worked on a lot.
**TK Powered Martial Artist** - Hmm, can´t exactly figure out what you mean, but psionics will be included, and martial arts as well.
**Ghost** - Hmm, I´ve been considering having some sort of undead playable. But I´m feeling more for having an actual flesh-and-bone character (like a vampire)...at least for starters
**Sentient Weapon** - Don´t know...never been fond of species that are "sentient objects". Golems are one thing, but this is something else...
**Shadow Melding/Controlling Assassin** - I´ve got to say that I´ve never really liked the little I´ve seen of Naruto...probably because I´ve studied ninjutsu for a few years now. There will definitely be an Shinobi-style PrC, but it probably won´t be very supernatural.
Thanks for the input ;D Although, I have to say I had expected something a little less extreme.

Just wanted to see what you thought of some things.

Just that in what I've seen of Fantasy settings dedcation to ones martial arts form(s) seem to be a way for mental faculties to be honed so that TK can be used. Discipline etc.

For me I had a lot of love for some of the npcs I've seen in different series. The Dog from Batman Beyond. Familiars etc. They usually are secondary to some other character but they are so full of character themeselves I thought, why not that for a playable character? Something to explore anyway.

It was the only example I could think of *shrug*. The bending of reality awareness would perhaps be more representative in Ninja Scrolls or Inuyasha I haven't pain much attention to it. I just liked the idea of a martial arts assasin bending the shadows themselves to her will.

Where's the fun in that? >:D Really though if you can take care of the extremes then the more mundane should be easier. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I'd love to play a fantasy Saga game.

Good to hear, people rarely respond to these threads...I think they are too far down the main page :P
Anyway, I´ve put some extra effort in trying to get the thing into at least playable shape, and my plan was to have a casting call open sometime later this year...perhaps in November-December or so.
Right now, I´m working on a new mechanic I´ve considered implementing...something like a mix of the Destiny mechanic and the Legacy destiny...perhaps I´ll put it up here soon for input.

Sounds like fun. I've been wanting to play in a fantasy campaign for sometime. The few that get started are too few and fill up fairly quick. As far as my imput on the type of fantasy game. I'd be interested in playing a traditional Fantasy type game. Fighters, Dungeons,wizards and Dragons sorta stuff. I am up for anything though. Have you ever though of making a Western campaign?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-09-08 05:17:05)

Fantasy roleplaying is my absolute favorite, closely followed by the Star Wars setting.
I´ve never been a big fan of Western, tried it once or twice, but I think it is too "normal" for me.

The best kind of Western, to me, is the combo Westerns. Fantasy+Western, SteamPunk+Western, SciFi+Westurn, Horror+Western(Looking @ you SuperNatural) Etc.

### **Anonymous** (2009-09-08 19:32:44)

Ya, I've never met someone willing to play one. I think your right though, Westerns are probably too mundane. I do like the Steam Punk idea. I have never played, but I like the concept.

Now rereading my own post, I have a question.
How is Star Wars *not* Fantasy? ;D

It has enough SciFi elements to set it apart IMO.

It has enough SciFi elements to set it apart IMO.So does DnD so I'm not too clear on your point <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

OK, let´s rephrase it. Star Wars includes many fantasy elements, but in my book it has enough other elements to set it apart from the Fantasy genre and become something else.
And maybe I´m simplifying, but when I say fantasy, I generally mean "medeival- D&D-LOTR-Shannara-Wheel of Time-David Eddings" fantasy, and when I say SciFi I mean "futuristic-Star Trek" stuff.
And just for the record, I gave up Voyager after about the first season or so...and have never been too impressed with Star Trek since.
