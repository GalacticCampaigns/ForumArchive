# My RPG's, anyone interested?

### **Rowen** (2008-11-13 08:34:40)

I have a slew of RPG's that I can make a game with, granted I've never run any of them so any game I do might be a bit slow in the beginning. Here's is the list.
**RPG LIST**
New World of Darkness
Vampire: The Requiem
Werewolf: The Forsaken
Mage: The Awakening
Promethean: The Created
Exalted 2nd Edition
Robotech
Ghostbusters
World of Warcraft
Those are about all. I would prefer to not to run anything based of the D20 game system. Let me know which you like best and I'll see what I can come up with. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Hmm, you suggested Exalted before didnÂ´t you? I read up on the rules a little back then, and it looks fun. Also, isnÂ´t World of Warcraft pretty much D&D 3rd with a few changes?

## Re:My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **Rowen** (2008-11-13 17:49:37)

Yeah its pretty much the same as D&D. I think I did mention something about Exalted before. Just trying to see what most people would like to play other than Saga.

## Re:My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-13 17:56:38)

I think Exalted sounds good, and IÂ´d be interested. While I like Star Wars a lot, my favorite setting has always been fantasy settings.
I may have said it before, but I am working on a system that uses SAGA rules in a fantasy setting. ItÂ´s getting closer to finish, but still some work left.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-13 19:24:32)

While I don't own any of Rowen's games, a fantasy setting with Saga rules is something I could really get into.
If you need any help, DA, I might be able to do something.

I never got to play VtM, although I hear alot of people still like it. The new one isn't bad from what I can tell and surfing the White Wolf forums, just a little more gory? not as romanticized.
I'm always on the look for other RPGs to, so this list may grow.

Robotech was one of my favorite shows and games. I had...still have most of the game material for the system.
Rowen have you seen the Robotech movie *The Shadow Chronicles*? Good movie. that would be an interesting timeline to run a game in. There's even a source book out for it.

Well well Rowen I see we have a lot of the same books in our collections. I've been an advid collecter of the Vtm books along with D&D 3.0-3.5 I returned the 4.0 books lol. A few of my friends and I get together weekly to run the new WoD books personally I think their crap Vtm era for the win! Let me know if you think to get anything moving ill put my hand in for help and to have a character go with ya

It's not d20. The main skill checks involve rolling 2d10's to give a percentage.

Cool, a non-D20 game system hehe.
I have so many I would like to run but so little time. I really would like to run a World of Darkness, that leads into Vampire or Werewolves, or both. I think it would be really cool.

I've played Robotech PBP games before. My problem is I usually play a combat tech, and the GMs don't know what to do with me when everyone else is a pilot. hehe. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> But I wouldn't mind playing in one again.
As for World of darkness. I did do a vampire larp at one time, and that experience has soured me to anything involving Vampire. But I'm willing to give it another try, in a different medium.

Vampire LARP could sour anyone to the game.  I haven't even been in one (but I have seen them) and I'll tell ya, I still have nightmares about those people.

## Re: My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **Avarna** (2009-01-18 10:18:22)

Well. I lucked out and no one in the group thought they were a real vampire. Its just the internal politics, and the fact that I didn't have any friends to hang out with while I was there made it pretty boring.

So, ah, when are we kicking this off?  I'm all for the fuzzy, wuzzy raging ball of frenzied death game.

### **Rowen** (2009-01-26 11:45:29)

Not sure honestly. Possibly when my current Saga game ends. As long as there is interest I'm up to running one. Just remember I've never run anything other than D20 so I might be a bit fuzzy rules and mechanics wise.

## Re: My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-22 06:44:45)

Ro, when you finally get a game off the ground I'd like to play.
> **Avarna wrote:**
>

No, most Vampire Larpers tend to be a bit smarter than your average bear and don't believe such silliness. The ones that do find themselves cut out of the group pretty quick.
The problem.... I think I can best sum it up with an anecdote:
So, I was at my local gaming store looking at RPG product. This particular store does carry a bit of stuff for the WOD LARPs, so it's not out of the ordinary to have a group of LARPers around. Or rather, it *is* out of the ordinary, but not so much so that the regulars (of which I am one) don't see it happen from time to time.
In wanders this group of Vampire LARPers, in full costume. Full costume. Victorian frilled shirts, powdered wigs, and all. One guy even had a little plastic fencing sword. They head over to the LGS's RPG area, and are looking at the WOD section. Not one of them picked up an actual book, but they were making these snide glances at all the other people who were looking at gaming product.
Seeing nothing any of them wanted to buy (there hasn't been a WOD LARP product in MONTHS at this point) they wander over to where the cash register is. One of them starts a conversation with one of the girls who works there, I think he knew her.
Now, in this party, there were about five people. Two guys, three girls. They all thought they were "Hawt Suff" because they were all dressed up the way they were. Now, I'm not one to judge people by appearance, but three of them looked like a bunch of fat, dumpy idiots dressed up in two layers too many on one of the hottest days of the year. I can only imagine what the clothes they were wearing must've smelled like when they went home.
They're all standing in front of the counter, the one guy is talking to (or rather hitting on) one of the girls at the counter (who obviously, by body language alone, doesn't like him but has to be polite....) and the other people in the group fan out around the cash area and commence a very loud and very pointed conversation about how "tabletop gamers are lame." Yet there they are, in a store that sells predominantly tabletop games.
It would have been bad enough, were they not impeding people from getting to the cash. But even when it was painfully obvious that someone wanted to get to the cash to pay for something, and the foursome were all actually looking right at the person who was trying to politely slip in an "excuse me" they blatantly refused to move.
They're throwing out all sorts of nasty comments about tabletop gamers and "CCGers" as they put it. The proprieter of the shop comes in, sees two people trying to get to the cash and the five idiots standing there and preventing them and on his way through to his office politely (under the circumstances, for him) asks them to move out of the way. Several seconds, and a few dirty looks later, they move.
As soon as the two people are cashed out, the LARPer's move back into thier original position. They've been continuing thier conversation, and have actually gotten louder and more obnoxious since the owner has "dared" to come in and tell them to stop interfering with his business.
The owner comes back in, and he's standing there beside me, just looking at them and shaking his head. I'm the kind of regular customer who's a friend of the owner and the staff. I go down there and help them load and offload trucks from conventions on occasion, and if I'm around when a shipment comes in I always help with boxes. I even help keep an eye on the store when I'm around.
So, the owner asks me how long they've been there. I tell him, about 20 minutes. He asks if they've been behaving obnoxiously the whole time, I tell him no, they've only been doing that about 15 minutes. He asks if they've bought anything, I say nothing that I've saw. So he asks me to go over with him because he's going to make them leave.
He walks over and tries to get thier attention. They talk louder. He tells them to leave more loudly. Finally, I put my hand on his shoulder and shake my head, then pull out my badge and hold it up and yell over them that if any of them are still standing there in 15 seconds they're going to get arrested and fined for tresspassing. More dirty looks, and they start clearing out. One girl, the last one to file toward the door, looks at the owner and says "We're never coming back to your shop again."
It made me laugh. It made both of us laugh. His store is the only one that sells Vampire LARP stuff in the city. I had occasion to go to one of thier events (in a professional capacity), and I found that these five people make up the core of a group of about 13. All of whom are more or less just like them. Not a popular sport in my neck of the woods.
Vampire LARP people are not idiots, but a lot of them think they're better than everyone else. It's a really great way to meet people and attract new members to your club, treat them like dirt and behave like you're some kind of elite fraternity.

On a side note, the Dreampd 9 Silhouette system is excellent for mecha games. A bit on the cruchy side, but a quick system and has lots of opportunities to upgrade every aspect of you machines. Combat can be deadly, so watch it. It's a class-less system, and gets Breeder Bonus points for that.
My current favorite is the new d6 system, but I haven't got to play it. Like the Dream Pod 9 Silhouette system, it's great for creating anything and everything you want. It's a class-less system, and tends toward high cinematic action, but can easily be played as dark and gritty.
Savage Worlds is the anti-d20, I think. Fast (oh, so incredibly fast). Blazing fast, which adds greatly to game play. Easy to understand, and you can do some awesome stuff with it. It's simple, and everything you need for your character fits on the front half of a sheet of paper. Class-less (Breeder Bonus approved). Lends toward pulp action style of play. Lots of settings have already been 'Savaged', including Star Wars.
Exalted is freakin' beautiful to look at, but the rules bog down, I think. Many, many points of awesome in the setting, and the flavor of the book. I have never thought about fantasy superheroes until I saw the book. After that, I can't help but to keep thinking about them. Class-less, yet with White Wolf typical categories.
World of Darkness sounds fun as hell to me, and I love the new system (old one was okay, but...it had it's faults). The setting is great, but I'm not as happy with the 'Big Books' as much as I would like. Not to say they're not good (they are quite good), just less than I was hoping for. I want some one to take Orpheus and make it into the nWoD.
For Super hero games- or just about anything else- Mutants and Master Minds is the book to get. Class-less, but still d20, it's a game you can do nearly anything with. I have issues running it (the power level limit bother mes to no end), but playing it is fun. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to run much of anything, especially 'beyond mere mortal' games, like super heroes and over the top fantasy games.
That's it for me. For now.

I like the Breeder stamp of approval, very fitting. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> However, I do own some of those systems.....doubt I will ever try to host a game. I haven't had much luck in the way of GMing, my games seem to start out strong and wind down to an almost screeching halt. I'm still trying to figure out why that is..... poor GMing skills, bad story telling? Still not sure.
I love the nWoD setting, mainly the nWoD, Vampire and Werewolf portions of the game setting. To play or GM one of those seems like it would be really cool.

## Re: Re:My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-27 15:48:37)

Breeder, I recently have joined a Savage Worlds game and am enjoying the system immensely. You can't do better for $10, methinks, and the setting books I have seen appear to be well-fleshed-out.
Rowen, that happens to me a lot too. I think it has a lot to do with players' and GMs' levels of endurance as far as games go. A single session that is boring for either side can really hurt a game, for me. I feel like that with my current IRL game I'm DM'ing. One of my players is like a career DM, who always thinks he can do better. It's hard to run a game, knowing that one of my players probably thinks everything I do is subpar. In the same game, I have two new players (new to roleplaying, not just the system), so it's hard to keep them into the game while keeping career-DM intrigued as well.
I take solace in the fact that at least one of my players freaking loves the story I've set up. While the rest of the party may just be in it for the social aspects, or the combat, I know that, at least through him, my campaign means something.

I've been real tempted to try Savage Worlds ... always looked interesting. How does it play in your opinion?

## Re: Re:My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-27 17:15:54)

Fairly easy to learn, and like Breeder said, super fast in the playing. Exploding dice are badass (if you roll a max result on a dice, you get to roll again): I haven't seen so many natural 6's come up on d6's until this game. I also really like the cards-for-initiative system. You keep a standard deck of playing cards. At the beginning of each round of combat, every combatant draws a card. The round goes in order, from Aces to Deuces, in reverse suit order (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs). Jokers are in, allow you to jump in whenever, and give you +2 to your rolls for that round.
It's also setting-free so you could theoretically use it to run anything. The game I'm playing in is [Northern Crown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Crown_(roleplaying_game) "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Crown_(roleplaying_game)"), as a Cherokee scout, and the book itself gives examples of steampunk, sci-fi, horror, wild west, and fantasy tropes.

I don't get to run games outside of this site. I was mainly meaning the games I run here. After Effects lasted 3 Chapters, but never finished due to lack of interest (I had an awesome ending in store for that game to and the players were so close!). The last only hitting to about page 10 before half the players quit posting.
I like to GM but it becomes a real hassle if it seems the players are not enjoying themselves. Perhaps I just need to step back and see where the game went wrong. Perhaps it was something I just over looked, I'm a fairly new GM having only GMed 2 games thus far. So its possible.
As for running another game, I'm having a hard time deciding which game to run honestly. Saga, D&D 4e, nWoD......the choices are there but I just can't decide.

## Re: Re:My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-28 00:08:51)

I really don't think it's you though. I know my own history with the site has more to do with me being lazy and noncommittal. I noticed the forum gets a lot of new members ready to jump into a Saga game, but they very rarely seem (at least to me, I don't want to push any assumptions) to be committed to playing long term, which is what GM's are looking for.
Having a game open for playing 24/7 on a forum is a big paradigm shift for me. Many of us are used to playing in a regular interval that's not daily. Having an online responsibility like this can be a stranger than having a weekly (or so) IRL social responsibility that's, at least in my experience, not so importan to begin with. I just had to cancel my IRL game tomorrow because half of my players are students and this is finals week. I sympathize with them, mind, but it's still frustrating to have them cop out.

You got some good points there Rev. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I may start up a D&D game again but it will be weeks down the road. It also depends on if there is any interest in such a game with one have just started up.
D&D was my first RPG experience so I'm sure it will always have a fond spot in my heart. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> So perhaps I can find the courage to give it another go. Wouldn't mind playing in a game at some point in time as well, could be loads of fun.

## Re: Re:My RPG\'s, anyone interested?

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-30 00:15:36)

Well, depending if my game seems to flow well as a pbp, I'd love to play in a game. I might also start up a "variant" game we play called Fight Monsters!! It originated in 3rd edition, with the random encounter and treasuretables in the DMG. The DM would roll up an encounter on these tables, the party would fight them and get the treasure. Rests and "town" visits (healing and shop) would be random as well. Asmor.com makes this viable for 4e, and my group has seen how easy it is to play. It's mindless arcade-y fun, with no roleplaying, but it's fun if you're in that kindof mood. It also lets you try out a lot of different builds.
I'm not sure how well that would work here, as not many people are familiar with the 4e rules, but we'll see as time goes on.

Okay, I'm leaning heavily toward running a Exalted 2nd edition game. If I have my choices I would say out off all the RPG's I have my top 3 to attempt to run would be.....
1. Exalted
2. World of Darkness
3. D&D 4e
I'll be reading up on Exalted and trying to figure a way to get those interested characters without needed to purchase the book. Let me know if any of you are up for this. I won't start anything until I have a full adventure fleshed out and ready to go.

Alright that's at least three players! Very cool. I started reading the rules and setting last night so I can put together something with at least some knowledge of the game. I wont give a time I expect to have it ready so I don't end up painting myself into a corner. One thing we could discuss is characters. I'm not sure if any of you have the core book (except for DA that is). There is a character generator that is free to download, I'm not sure at this point if it is automated and keeps track of what you can and cannot pick for skills, ect.

I'll give more details as I learn about the game a little more. Might even do a play test or two to figure out some of the finer rules, like the dreaded tick system lol.

Hehe, I havenÂ´t read up a lot on much more of the system than the character creation, as well as some basic deals on the other parts, and I donÂ´t have any experience playing. But just to be clear, which books do you have Rowen?

I have most of them, if not all. I want to stick with just the core rules to make this first time less complicated. If we really like the game we can start throwing in other material from the other books as we see fit.

OK, thatÂ´s fine. Guess IÂ´ll have to lay the plans of a Dragon-Blooded Exalted on ice for a while. IÂ´ll cook something up for you shortly.

Thanks DA <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Yeah from what I'm reading (and hopefully retaining) I believe the first group should be newly Exalted Solars. Once we have a firm grasp on the rules and game mechanics I won't mind changing the story or campaign to accommodate different Exalts.
I like the sound of the Lunars as well, shapeshifting coolness ftw! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

If you need a major protagonist, I could probably crack open that book about the Abyssals as well... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I have the 2nd edition books, if that's what we're playing. The .pdf's that were available for free on most of the major .pdf sites a month or so back. Haven't really touched them yet, but I'll read up.

Yep 2nd edition is what were gonna play Rev. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Glad you have some of the books already.
The program I listed a little further up in the posts will aid in making your character a LOT easier, it will also export to a PDF that you can just email me so I have a copy of your character.

I haven't forgotten about this everyone. Still reading the rules and taking it all in. I'm just worried about having enough people to play this once I decide to run it.
