Any here of these guys. One of my browsing jaunts found me stumbling over these guys. Have a look and see what you think.

I've heard of the system. Apparently, the system is good but extremely rules heavy. The main rulebook is close to a thousand pages. You need literally thousands of pages of stuff to run the game.

Wow that's nuts! I couldn't imagine a rule book that big lol.

I only say that because I've had the rulebook dropped on my head at one point. It looks heavy, but the main rulebook itself is (surprisingly) light for it's size. But it still hurts like a bugger when it comes down on the top of your skull.

From someone with experience with different rules systems in this genre (me!):
My advice is to skip all of the other Supers rulesets and go staright to Mutants and Masterminds 2nd Edition. It may not have a thousand page rulebook, or statblocks for all of your favorite Marvel characters, but for character building and ease of play it is Phenominal! I love it, I've played it, and its better than the other published systems out there. Give it a try, its cheap used on Amazon nowadays.

Isn't it D20 though or am I thinking of something else?

I don't think it's D20. I think that publishing company that produced it made a D20 supers game.

Ill look for it then. I've heard others mention this game and it cant hurt to have a look see lol.

Well not to dampen your enthusiasm (because it's the best supers system I've seen) but it is a d20 system. It requires a fair amount of DM supervision to prevent things from getting out of hand, but it's very easy to design the kind of hero you want.

I'm actually a mod over at Hero under the same name <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
The system is pretty detailed and fun, but it does have a bit of a learning curve depending on what you're used to. The game uses only d6s, and typically uses 3d6 for its reolution system. The game is point buy and can emulate anything within your imagination to build. Most people would know the Hero System from Champions (which up until the current edition was the flagship book). It scales decently between normals to heroic to superheroic, and has rules for vehicle and base construction. If interested, your best bet is to snag a copy of Sidekick, the Hero Lite book, to look over the rules. A vast online source for Hero characters is [Surbrook&#39;s Site](http://surbrook.devermore.net/index/archive.html "http://surbrook.devermore.net/index/archive.html"). There, you can peruse what Hero characters look like and what can be built <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
As far as M&M, it is d20, but not standard d20. It only uses a single d20 for all resolutions and is a point system not unlike the Hero System. I would dare say that M&M is Hero's distant relative in some ways. If you're familiar with d20 games, there's less of a learning curve and more flexibility than what you might be used to. Personally, when I run this, I have several house rules that I use to emulate the genre a bit more. But overall the system is fun.
I'm a bit biased on both games, so YMMV <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
