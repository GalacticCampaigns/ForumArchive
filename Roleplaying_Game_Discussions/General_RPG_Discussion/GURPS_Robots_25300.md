# GURPS: Robots

### **BWS2K** (2013-01-04 12:21:50)

I just noticed today that Steve Jackson Games released [GURPS Classic: Robots](http://e23.sjgames.com/item.html?id=SJG30-6511 "http://e23.sjgames.com/item.html?id=SJG30-6511") on e23! I'm wicked pumped about that, and just thought I'd share it the only place that anyone might care. I have the *Reign of Steel* setting, as well as *Space* and *Cyberpunk*, and have been waiting for **years** for this to be released on pdf as well. What I want to do is get and run a campaign on here... but we all know that usually doesn't work out so well. So I'll settle for plugging the book a bit. <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->
