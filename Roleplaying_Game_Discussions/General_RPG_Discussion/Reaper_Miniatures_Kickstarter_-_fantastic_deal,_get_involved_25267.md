# Reaper Miniatures Kickstarter - fantastic deal, get involved

### **simplyscribed** (2012-08-25 08:05:19)

Hey all, if you haven't already I strongly recommend you to check out the Reaper Miniatures kickstarter project and invest in the Vampire level. They've reached so many stretch goals now that the $100 you pledge will get you well exceeding 200 miniatures! The more people who pledge, the more miniatures get unlocked.
A little late notice, I came to the party late myself, but there's still about 10 hours on the clock if you want to get in on this deal.
