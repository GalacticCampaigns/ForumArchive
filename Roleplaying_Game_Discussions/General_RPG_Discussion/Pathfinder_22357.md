We have all been introduced to D&D 4e and not everyone is pleased with it slimmed down, streamlined game play. Although some players and DM's do play this newest version its still not considered the same.
I'm not sure how many of you know about Pathfinder, but I think its worth mentioning here. From what I have been keeping up with, its D&D 3.5 but with a bunch of fixes to things that use to plague D&D3.5
I've downloaded the beta rule book for this and plan on checking it out. I just wanted to see who here was interested in this product. I can't say Ill make a game for it but its a possibility.
Anyway, let me hear your thoughts. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Rowen,
I played Pathfinder for the first time last weekend and really enjoyed it. My group just never cared for 4.0, to be honest. Pathfinder has a number of little tweaks that make it an improvement over 3.5 as well, IMHO. It just feels like D & D is supposed to, which 4.0 never did for me.
The Paizo adventure paths seem really well done as well, if you are looking for easy to port adventures.

I am currently running a Pathfinder game, if that says anything. Tabeltop.
Since it's based in Eberron, I've had to make some adjustments, like psionic classes and dragonmarks. Also, they are still tweaking it, so somethings aren't as smooth as they eventually will be. But its still got some cool tweaks, and I like it.

One thing you'll have to do is to tread carefully with the CR's. Every base race and class got a boost, thus will rip through an encounter faster than they did before. This will result in faster XP and level advancement, and less of a challenge. My fix is to beef up the encounter a CR or two, but keep the Xp at the lower amount.
Unless you like the fast. In which case, roll with it.
