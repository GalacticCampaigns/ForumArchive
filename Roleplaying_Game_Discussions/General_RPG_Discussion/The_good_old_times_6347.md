Just a place to talk about previous games you have played in or ran. Stratagies you have used blunders you may have made things like that, just for fun no bashing please.
I was in a 2nd ed. game playing a transmuter, we had just barely finished a mission within a drow city. We where low on spells and hit points running through tunnels to leave the area. Trying as hard as we could to avoid patrols from the hornuts nest we had just stired within the city our luck ran out and a drow patrol found us. Not in any shape to take them on we ran for it, there where several drow swords men a few drow lizard riders and of course a drow priestess i the middel of it all. Some of the players began to consider there next character options no not I, my mage stopped running long enough to cast one desperate spell.
Knowing full well the resistance of the drow and more so the priestess, having fought many already it was a gambel. Luck was on my side the DM failed all his rolls as I polymorphed the priestess into a whale within the tunnel pinning here escort. I was not done though, I cast enlarge the next round finishing the fight. I never knew if I got them all any behind the priestess probly survied but it ws fun it saved the party and we all lived through yet another encounter.
Lets here some of your stories fun times blunders whatever <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Moved to they General Discussion forum, since it's not specifically Star Wars.
As for my good old times... I've had so many it's hard to isolate one story. Hmm. I'll have a think about that.

I remember a blunder.
2nd Ed D&D,
Stop me if you heard this one,
So our wizard decides to Teleport the group.
Its been awhile, but I believe he said there was a very small chance of failure.
We all ended up under ground and died.
End of Campaign. What a crapy way to end a game. *sigh* Teleport sucks!

LOL it takes a while for many to learn a first level spell feather fall (teleport above your destination). <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Well, I donÂ´t have very much RPG history before I came here...hard to find groups etc...But I did play with a bunch of friends for a while. We played Call of Cthullu, and my pals arenÂ´t perhaos the most serious of players...and the DM has a slight sadistic tendency...
My first character (and the one that lasted the longest) was a engineer tech freak slash weapons freak. I would load up with all kinds of weapons <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> . My favorites were the Elephant Gun and a electic wire that i used as a melee weapon by carrying a battery on my back : . To that you may add various handguns and rifles...even alien tech at some time.
Anyway, one time we were seraching this old cave/tomb/dungeon and we entered a dark room. When we lit a torch, suddenly we saw that we were standing on top of cages filled with zombies. We were forced to roll a sanity check to stay sane (pretty much the point of CoC), and we all passed. But then this happends: My fellow players decides to burn all the zombies, using some of the gasolen we always carry around...so they pour the gasolen down over the zombies and lits the fire. Me and the DM are stunned...and then he forces ME to do a new sanity check, saying the other two donÂ´t have to, since they are the ones commiting the act. I fail utterly, and the DM determines that I develop a temporary necrophobia (fear of death/the dead) and I run screaming away and hides in our car, paranoid as hell with the Elephant Gun in hand. Later, when they are done, my friends comes to the car - in the pitch-black night - and bangs on the windshield...
Other things I recall is me getting jailed up for trashing a phone booth with my crowbar, us going in and out on mental wards, my pal getting blown up by the 60 molotov cocktails he was wearing...and my favourite (I donÂ´t know what I was thinking): We are hunting a target through a forest, and we need him alive. I decide to shoot his kneecaps with my Elephant Gun...
