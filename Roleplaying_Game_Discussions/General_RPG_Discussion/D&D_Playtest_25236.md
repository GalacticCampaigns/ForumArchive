# D&D Playtest

### **Rowen** (2012-05-25 05:51:49)

So, did anyone else get in the playtest for 5th edition? I signed up and funny enough got the invite. The first playtest packet is small, running at just over 5mb. I've only flipped though it so far. Has a small file for DM's and Players, premade characters and a monster file with a hand full of baddies. OH and a sample adventure that will take characters from level's 1-3.
It seems interesting but I havn't really given it the once over to see if much is changed from previous versions. I have a feeling it will take a step back from 4e and be closer to 3.0/3.5 (Pathfind anyone?).....but time will tell. Supposedly they are listening to the players this iteration.
Anyway, had a moment and wanted to post that bit of info. Hope everyone is doing well and having fun gaming. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I´ve been lurking around the D&D boards a bit and picking up on various discussions regarding the next edition, though I´ve mostly been following the fan discussions, and paying less attention to the official releases. Most likely I´ll just snatch up some good ideas I find and work them into my own homebrew system, but it´s interesting to follow some of the debates.
I have to say that one of the things that surprises me a bit is that they still haven´t attempted to use something like the Condition Track (which is probably my number one thing about new things that SAGA Edition did great) to complement the abstract Hit Point system. A quick look at some of the threads discussing Hit Points leads me to believe it would work wonders for a lot of people.

Oh yeah, a condition track would be a nice addition. Honestly if they used several features from Saga it would be for the better. Ill be interested in watching the development and being in the playtest is a neat way to preview what 'could' make it in the final product.

So far I'm not seeing a condition track. They do have a section about conditions but they releate to states such as being 'prone', 'paralysed', or 'Frightened". Nothing similar to Saga unfortunatly. Magic seems untouched as seems much like its presented in 4e, but I could be wrong. There are a few other things they have changed that are minor. I'm assuming they will add more to it over the next several months.

Yeah, I should expect that the "playtest" version won't bear a lot of resemblance to what they eventually produce, or at least I would hope so! I don't think they'll adopt any of Saga's best features though - Saga and 4e had parallel development but yet were nothing alike, I think they want to keep the two product lines as unique as possible. I'd love to be proved wrong though. I could stand to give D&D one more shot but it would have to be a very different system to 4e to pull me in.

Ill keep this thread updated as much as I can. Once the next playtest material comes though I may even run the sample adventure thats in it for anyone interested in seeing what its about.

I'd be up for running the sample adventure, currently playing an odnd game on a different board. The simplicity of it is wonderful <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
