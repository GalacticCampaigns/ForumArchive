Does anyone else remember a project that was running on the WotC Saga forum to create a Mass Effect RPG system using Saga as a base? If so, do you know if they ever finished it or would anyone be interested in trying something like that ourselves? If there is a Mass Effect roleplaying system, I'd be interested in playing a game. Not GMing though, that's not exactly my cup of tea. ^^'

I also love the Mass Effect universe - though not necessarily what they've done to the story in #2 <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
as I recall, it was only ever a minimal conversion. Race modifiers and such were assembled, the guns had unlimited ammo but overheated on a natural 1, and they more or less statted out the Normandy in SWSE style. I dunno if they're revisiting it given the sequel being released tho...
I am of the type that gets far too interested in breaking down a universe into a ruleset, but in this case since I don't have access to ME2 my nitpicking/completionist side is successfully preventing my OCD side from starting a Mass Effect Conversion right now :P

I remember one of them, and in my opinion it did a less than satisfactory job of recreating the universe. I could do better myself.. Actually I am about ready to srart focusing on a project like this. I am a Mass Effect fanatic so maybe we can get something together.

It seems like it would be an easy conversion, at least compared to some. The only real rules difference I can think of is the method of handling ammo in the first Mass Effect. And in the second, even that's pretty similar to Star Wars. If we do try to do something like this, I'd be happy to try converting some of the species and maybe some Biotic powers and such. I'd probably leave the ships and equipment to someone else, though. Again, not exactly my area of expertise. ^^'

Here are some species I whipped up real quick. Let me know what you think, how they can be improved, etc.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Human Species Traits**</span>
Humans share the following species traits:
**Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Humans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:** Human base speed is 6 squares.
**Bonus Trained Skill:** Humans are versatile and accomplished at many tasks. A Human character chooses one additional trained skill at 1st level. The skill must be chosen from the character's list of class skills.
**Bonus Feat:** Humans gain one bonus feat at 1st level.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Asari Species Traits**</span>
Asari share the following species traits:
**Medium Size:**As Medium creatures, Asari have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:** Asari base speed is 6 squares.
**Natural Biotics:** If an Asari character has Biotics as a trained skill, she gains Biotic Training as a bonus feat.
**Wisdom of Age:** Asari gain a +2 to their wisdom and charisma scores upon entering the Matron stage of their life cycle, and an additional +2 upon entering the Matriarch stage of their life cycle. This bonus stacks with the normal modifications for old age.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Quarian Species Traits**</span>
Quarian share the following species traits:
**Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Quarians have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
**Speed:** Quarian base speed is 6 squares.
**Enviro-suit:** Quarians must wear enviro-suits at all times due to their nearly non-existent immune system. While in her enviro-suit, a Quarian is immune to poison or disease. However, if the suit is compromised, she can contract poisons and diseases, which will be twice as effective as they would be for any other race. If a suit is damaged, rather than removed or destroyed, damaged portions are sealed automatically, stopping the spread of the infection(s) resulting from the breach. If the suit is unable to contain the infection, the poison or disease does not need to succeed in an attack role to persist.
**Expert Mechanic:** If a Quarian has Mechanics as a trained skill, she gains Skill Focus (Mechanics) as a bonus feat.
**Brilliant Tech:** Quarians can take 10 on any Mechanics, Security, or Use Computer checks even when distracted or threatened.

I think they're too complicated for what they need to be really.
Asari should just get a straight up +2 to charisma (as it's evident that all species, even salarians who reproduce via eggs, find them attractive. It also helps with the biotic thing) The free feat is fine.
For quarians I'm thinking they should just have a penalty to con, either -4 or just -2, to represent their succeptability to disease and contagions whilst outside of their suit. Each quarian would get a free suit (same deal as ubese). Quarians are known for being technologically capable however, and gain skill focus use computers as a bonus feat if they have the skill training. They also benefit from +2 to their INT score.

I assume Biotics work the same way as the Force? i.e. Requiring a biotic feat. If so, then as Asari are 'natural biotics' they should get that feat for free.
An interesting note is that it appears you are either born biotic or not. Thus it could only be taken at 1st level.
Don't forget that Asari seem to be able to mind meld. Let's say DC10 Endurance to form a two way telepathic link to a willing adjacent subject. You can make Charisma based skill checks through the link or aid another.

Hmmm...y'know what just occurred to me? There's a free-form roleplaying section on this forum now. Would anyone be interested in a free-form Mass Effect game?

### **Thraken** (2010-03-10 18:12:12)

Hrmm.. guess not? >.>
Do you think Talents and Powers would work better as Saga Talents or a 'Combat Maneuver' type system based off starship maneuvers/force powers?

For fans of the d6 System, there's been a few people working on a [d6 Mass Effect RPG](http://www.bozark.com/mass/x/downloads.html "http://www.bozark.com/mass/x/downloads.html") if you're interested ...

Asari live for thousands of years and they seem to be just as physically fit when they're Matriarchs as when they are Maidens. Also their ages seem fluent, they become Matrons after having their first child from what I've observed. It's more of a state of mind than something gained by old age. I do believe they should receive a +2 or perhaps even +4 charisma (they're considered to be the most beautiful race out there), but perhaps receive a penalty to strength (they rely more on their biotic powers than on their physical prowess). I agree they should receive free biotic feat.
Anyway, I love ME (in particular ME2 stole my heart completely) and could probably be convinced to join a freeform game without much persuasion. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
