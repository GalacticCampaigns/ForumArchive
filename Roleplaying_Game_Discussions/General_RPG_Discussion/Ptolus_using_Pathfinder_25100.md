# Ptolus using Pathfinder

### **simplyscribed** (2011-10-09 10:59:11)

Just wanted to let you guys know I'm starting up a campaign set in Monte Cook's Ptolus using the Pathfinder system over at <!-- m -->[http://www.rondaksportal.com](http://www.rondaksportal.com "http://www.rondaksportal.com")<!-- m -->.
If you're interested and can be bothered to sign up for a different website, you should feel free to apply.
It's still in approvals and hasn't gone live yet, but when it does you'll find it in Available Worlds under the Pathfinder system, titled **City by the Spire**.
In the mean time you can find a version of the game description and character creation guidelines here: <!-- m -->[http://rpresources.wikidot.com/pfspire](http://rpresources.wikidot.com/pfspire "http://rpresources.wikidot.com/pfspire")<!-- m -->.
