# Marvel Heroic RPG?

### **BWS2K** (2012-08-19 07:17:37)

Anyone tried out the [Marvel Heroic Roleplaying Basic Game](http://www.margaretweis.com/shop#ecwid=2262007&mode=category&offset=0&sort=normal "http://www.margaretweis.com/shop#ecwid=2262007&mode=category&offset=0&sort=normal") yet? I discovered it on Amazon yesterday and have been reading some reviews, as well as looking over a copy. It just came out a few months ago but they have a couple other titles available for pre-order. At a glance, it seems to be much more about justifying your actions, *whatever* they may be, with common sense (read: *is that something your character would do/try in any comic ever?*) and then rolling an appropriate dice pool from available abilities etc. - as opposed to something like "I have *this* feat/attribute/power, so I do that." In this way I think it makes a much better storytelling system than a get-as-much-XP-by-crushing-minions-so-you-can-crush-bigger-minions-tomorrow sort of thing, but like I said, I haven't actually played it yet.
Thoughts?
