# Progressive Damage

Ok, so I´ve been working a lot lately on my fantasy adaption of SAGA Edition, and something struck me that might work very well since I want to keep the low (single-dice) damage of simple medieval weapons. Or, it could just not work at all because I´m forgetting something, which is why I´m posting the idea here.
It is simple really, and was inspired by the Accurate Blow (Elite Trooper) talent. Basically, for every 5 points by which your attack roll beats the opponents Reflex Defense, you add one dice of damage (or two, depending on the weapons base damage). I like the idea, and for one thing it would allow people that likes to use low-damage weapons to spend a little more of their resources on things that don´t increase damage, since (to a certain degree) attack bonuses are synonymous with damage bonuses.
This could of course be applied to SAGA Edition as well, though I see a potential balance issue with allowing it for weapons with higher base damage. Though if anyone has good arguments why it would be ok I´m listening, since I was thinking about using this for damage spells as well.
Thoughts? Suggestions? Questions?

Neat idea. Isn't there a trait for weapons (Accurate?) that you could use as a prereq for that ability/rule? Along the same lines I see that going in the other direction (reducing damage) for those occasions where pulling punches is asked for (Really, that does come up, It does, honest...)

Wow, it only took 2 months before I got a response, yay <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
Well there is the Accurate weapon trait that reduces range penalties for Short range, but I was thinking more of introducing this all over the board, considering that his would be a setting where the common weapon has typically 1 one dice of damage base. Just to clarify, what I was thinking was to add a multiplier to the damage (normal hit is damage x1 naturally), and then there could be certain abilities that added in their damage before the multiplication. For example, an assassin with Sneak Attack could increase his weapons base damage by 1 dice against flat-footed opponents, and then if he struck a good attack roll, the damage would go up a lot (making the unarmed "silent takedown" easier to actually pull off).
On the other hand, you could have a feat like Rapid Strike, which automatically gives you another dice of base damage, but at the same time reduces your chances of getting a multiplier.

There's a blog out there that's titled iirc "Get used to being ignored". That certainly applies to these boards sometimes. <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
I was thinking that the ability you were thinking of could be balanced with the Accurate trait. You could do it with foils and daggers but not claymores and halberds (they've got other useful traits).

I don´t really see a problem with it being done over the board, from small daggers to massive claymores. It´s basically a representation of accuracy, which can be applied with weapons of all sizes.
Not to mention it is simpler <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: -->
