# Fantasy SAGA

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-14 18:00:26)

OK, since it was removed along with the D&D section, IÂ´ll repost this here.
I am working on a system that uses SAGA rules as a baseline, but in a fantasy setting instead. This means some things changes fundamentally (approach to armor and melee combat, and the use of magic for instance), but much of the SAGA base are kept. Since itÂ´s so good <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Anyway, what IÂ´ll probably constantly be needing help with is filling the lists of feats, spells, martial techniques (special effects that enhances specific combat methods, I can provide an example if someone wish), and such things.
IÂ´m also probably going to post some things that IÂ´d like people to evaluate and critique. If you have any questions r wants to know more, just ask.

I'd love to help. Post away (and the examples would help).

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-16 14:15:48)

Feats and talents are gained in the same ways as SAGA. My thinking was also that prestige classes would have multiple class features. In addition to the even-level-increase one, theyÂ´d get one at the beginning, middle and end of their progression (levels 1, 5 and 10 for a 10th level PrC). Another thing is that I intend to use a Weapon Specialization system (if anyone has played BaldurÂ´s Gate youÂ´ll know what I mean), where a character can specialize in a single weapon and become far more skilled with it than other characters. Characters inreases their specialization by gaining levels, and the frequence of gaining specialization points in dependent on classes, with the top fighting class (Warrior) gains 1 every 2 levels.
Also, hereÂ´s an example of a spell and a martial technique:
***Twin Strike [Offensive] â€“ Basic Melee Techniques***
**Requirements**: Two-Weapon Fighting, Rapid Strike
**Activation Condition**: An opponent must successfully use the Parry skill against one of your attacks performed while taking a Full Attack action fighting with two weapons and using Rapid Strike (or any feat that has it as a prerequisite).
**Visual Description**: As the opponents weapon intercepts yours, you angles your weapon as to smash away his defense, opening him up for your next strike.
On first technique level, the opponent takes an additional -2 penalty to his Parry check against your next attack.
On second technique level, the additional penalty increases to -5.
On third technique level, the opponent takes an additional -2 penalty to all his Parry checks before the beginning of his next round.
***Arcane Armor [Protective] â€“ Arcane Magic***
**Mana Cost**: 2 **Range/Target/AoE**: Personal
**Casting Time**: Move Action **Maintainable**: Yes, as a Swift Action costing 1 Mana Point
**Visual Description**: The caster becomes surrounded by a faint, thin magical barrier, shimmering in gold.
**Improvement**: Bonus extends to +1 to Fortitude Defense, +1/10 points you beat the DC with.
If you succeeds at a DC 15 skill check, you gain a +1 armor bonus to your Reflex Defense. For every 5 points you beat the DC with, the bonus increases by +1. If you hit a DC of 35 or higher, increase the Mana Costs of this spell by 1 for each additional point of bonus.

I guess baldur's gate must have a pretty different system then if Elite trooper and soldier talents don't cover weapon specialisation...
Seems interesting - have you thought about ideas used in the Final Fantasy Saga conversion that Saga-edition.com links to?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-16 17:47:31)

HadnÂ´t looked at that site, there are some interesting things there, but not exactly like I had things in mind. A little too simple <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
The difference in the specialization system IÂ´m going to use from the one already in SAGA is that it is more specialized. In BaldurÂ´s Gate (which is AD&D 2nd I think) it worked like this: At certain levels you gained a proficiency point that you could place out on any weapon (a specific weapon) that your class could use. This would take you from 1st level (no penalties) to 5th (Where you had accumulated something like +2 to hit, +4 damage and increased attack speed with the weapon). Characters gained these points at different rates depending on what class they were in, and only Combat-focused classes could advance beyond level 2.
If you combine this with general proficiency feats that lets you use an entire weapon group without penalties, you can for example get a fighter who can use any kind of blade weapon with ease, but who has trained extensively with the katana blade, and thus is far more dealy when using it.

When does a character get a martial technique? They sound cool, but that part's a little unclear.

ItÂ´s like with Force Powers, you have to take a feat to gain 1+Wis mod techniques. Selecting a technique multiple times allows you to activate it at a higher technique level. Also, they can be used as often as possible, but have specific activation requirements.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-17 11:10:03)

Okay, that makes sense. So you want more martial techniques, then? I can do that, but what do you already have finished?
Also, there's a Parry skill, now? What other similar attack and defense skills are there?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-17 11:48:42)

Just one skill, Parry. It follows similar mechanics as the Block/Deflect talents. And each of the magic types has a separate skill.
IÂ´ve come to realize that making up stuff like feats, spells and similar things is quite time-consuming, and eventually, your creativity starts to run dry. So, yeah, if you comes up with cool ideas, please tell me. You donÂ´t have to specify a specific technique, spell, feat or talent if you want, but if you comes to think of some cool maneuver someone did in a movie, game or something, describe it, and I can probably work something out.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-17 12:11:23)

For examples of techniques I have though of I can mention Shield Tackle, Defensive Stance, Called Shot, Close Parry, Hilt Strike, Thrust.
Stances are special techniques that remains active until switched out, so they should be without penalties as much as possible, and also not have activation requirements, but rather more feat/talent requirements.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-19 15:07:40)

For those who are interested, hereÂ´s the current ruling for the Parry skill. It is of course subject to changes, as is everything else.
**<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">Parry(Dex)</span>**
With this skill, you can use your weapon more effectively to parry in combat. While basic parrying is incorporated into your Reflex Defense, this skill represents a higher level of training.
**Fighting Defensively(DC 15, Move Action, Trained Only):** When you uses the Fight Defensive action, you can make a skill check. If successful, you will gain a +1 bonus to your Reflex Defense, and an additional +1 for every 5 points you beat the DC with. This bonus stacks with the normal bonus for fighting defensively. If you chose to make no attacks in the round, you gains a +5 bonus to this check.
**Parry(DC Attack, Reaction):** When you are attacked by a melee attack, you may attempt to parry it and deflect it harmlessly away from you. When on opponent attacks you, make a skill check. If your skill check equals or exceeds the opponents attack roll, then you have managed to parry that attack and takes no damage. You may use this ability against any melee attack directed at you, but for every consecutive use in the same round, you takes a -5 penalty to your next check. If you manage to beat the opponents attack roll by 10 or more, you may immediately make an attack of opportunity against him, applying the same penalty to the attack roll as to your Parry check. You may use this application of the skill against ranged attack spells, but you takes a -5 on your skill check, and the object you used to parry will be considered to be targeted by the spell as well.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-19 22:24:49)

I like what you've done with the parry skill (though the wording could use work, to make it clearer)
but it's interested me enough to want to play it when you are done (it makes me dream of a swordsman deflecting arrows)

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-19 23:05:18)

Okay, here's my first stab at creating a martial technique. Feel free to rip it to shreds.
***Head Butt [Offensive] â€“ Basic Melee Techniques***
**Requirements**: Martial Arts I, Strength 13+
**Activation Condition**: You make a successful unarmed attack against an opponent you're grappling.
**Visual Description**: You draw close to your opponent and smack him with your forehead.
On first technique level, your opponent takes half damage and loses his next swift action as he recovers
On second technique level, as first level, except he loses his next move action.
On third technique level, as first level, except that he loses his next standard action.

Which parts of the wordings do you think is unclear? I may have skipped over it a little, since I expect to play this only with people who knows the SAGA system, which includes the Block/Deflect talents, which this skills is pretty much copied from.
I havenÂ´t really included any options for using this skill against arrows yet (except a Deflect Arrows talent for Monks), but I could see it possible as an ability somewhere.

I like it, but it seems a little too "spammable" by only requiring a successfull attack. CanÂ´t come up with some good alternative now though, perhaps too tired.

The "Visual Description" implies a successful grapple check is needed and would then mean this is part of that action. Is that the case? Just trying to understand it.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-20 12:35:58)

I thought about ot during the day, and though about the same thing. I think changing the actvation requirement to require a sucessfull unarmed attack while grappling would work. Any thoughts?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-20 13:00:34)

That would actually work. I thought the activation requirement was too simple, but I couldn't think of anything to add to it. Grapple seems to work fine, though I think it should be a grab attack, not grapple.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-20 13:13:21)

I was thinking about an unarmed attack against a foe you are grappling. That would mean you have gotten in close to him already.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-20 13:21:42)

Oh.
I was thinking you use the grab attack to grab your foe and smack your head into him. Both work, but it is your system, so I'll change it.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-28 15:15:50)

Nice, but would you mind explaining the differences in the magic types? Knowing the exact differences between them would help. If they're based on DnD, well, um, I've never played DnD.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-28 15:31:30)

Oh, and here's another martial technique:
***Full Retreat [Defensive] â€“ Basic Melee Techniques***
**Requirements**: Dodge, trained in Acrobatics
**Activation Condition**: You take the withdraw action while fighting defensively.
**Visual Description**: You retreat, backing away from your opponent.
On first technique level, you may move up to your speed when withdrawing, though you may not make any attacks in the round.
On second technique level, you may move up to your speed when withdrawing, and you may may an attack in that round.
On third technique level, as a full round action you may run when withdrawing.

I like it, and itÂ´s always nice to get things that makes the Dodge feat more useful (I have a few feats for that as well). I have some questions about how you meant it to work though.
To me, Full Defense means using the fighting defensively action and not taking any attacks in a round (gaining +5 or +10 RD bonus). This would mean the restriction on the first level is not necessary. On second level, you would be able to make one attack of opportunity only. And the third level would be impossible to perform, since you cannot take a Full-Round action while using Full Defense (Standard Action) and Withdraw (Move Action).
If your intention was that on third level youÂ´d be able to spend a Full-Round action to do all those three things, then it makes more sense, but then I think it is way too powerful.

Sure, you can actually make two different distinctions. The first is **Magic Types**, and the three available types are Arcane, Divine and Sylvan. Divine and Sylvan Magic is represented by a single skill, while Arcane Magic is separated into five different skills.
Arcane Magic consists of the Arcane Magic, Elemental Magic, Dark Magic, Mind Magic and Runic Magic skills.
The **Arcane Magic** skill covers all your basic Wizard-type abilities: Scrying and Divination, Illusionism, Minor Utility spells, Protection, Enchanting and Disenchanting and just mainly a general command over magic energies that flows though the world.
The **Elemental Magic** skill represents skill and training in the manipulation of the basic elements of the world (Fire, Earth, Wind and Water) and forces derived from those elements (Lightning, Cold, etc). This is probably the main skill for offensive spellcasting, due to the extreme raw power of these elements, and the vast repertoire of destructive spells (Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, Earthquakes, and many more).
The **Dark Magic** skill is the command over the darker arts, such as necromancy, demonicism or just plain corrupt magic. Think "Dark Side" and you should have a good idea where to start.
The **Mind Magic** skill represents abilities normally also called psionics: Telekinesis, Telepathy, Using your mind as a weapon, shield or as a tool to strengthen or enhance your physical abilities or affect the mind or body of another being.
The **Runic Magic** skill represents the training in the art of using powerful magic symbols to create magic effects of great power. A very rare art, as knowledge of the runes are scarce, and most runes are signs from ancient or extinct languages. They are extremely useful in the crafting of magical items however.
The **Divine Magic** is quite a bit different from the others. What abilities you gain is pretty much dependent on what god you serves. Typically, you will be able to use this skill to cast various spells from other skills, all dependent on what favors your deity grants you.
The **Sylvan Magic** represents the powers of nature, and the wild things living in it. The ability to speak with animals, or to assume some of their characteristics are abilities associated with this type of magic, as well as the ability to affect nature or to become a part of it. The kind of magic practiced by druids and other servants of nature.
Hope that helps somewhat, just ask if you have more questions.

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-28 19:48:11)

Um, yeah, I did mean fighting defensively, not full defense. Sorry.
I intended for it to work like this:
Withdrawing only allows you to move half speed as a move action. This ability would allow you to move your full speed, but you can't make an attack. Second level would allow you to make attacks of opportunity. Third, then, had to be more, and running was all I could think of. The intention was to be able to run in addition to all that. Yes, it's powerful, but it does require that the technique be taken three times first.
Oh, and thanks for the descriptions. It does help.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-29 05:02:41)

I think being able to run while using the withdraw action is a little pushing it. From my understanding, one of the balancing factors of the withdraw action is that you could get out of reach from someone safely, but not get so far away as to be out of their reach. I like the technique in general, and the two first levels seems fine.
I wrote something i was very happy with before that expanded on the Withdraw action, as a Leadership talent for the Warrior IÂ´m not at home right now so I canÂ´t look it up in detail, but it changed the action so that you had to clear all threatened squares in 2 squares of movement, rather than the normal 1, as well as allowing you to move your full speed while withdrawing. Perhaps that could be something?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-29 15:08:16)

Hmm . . . you mean like moving your full speed and not provoking any attacks of opportunity, regardless of how many threatened squares you move through?

---

**MoDaVader wrote:**

Not exactly, but I am at home now, and I found it.
**Fall Back** â€“ Once per encounter, you can call all allies within 12 squares of you to fall back and regroup. Any affected ally gains the ability to move up to his full speed when using the withdraw action. When using the withdraw action, he must also clear all threatened ares in 2 squares of movement, rather than the normal 1.
This was intended to be used in the heat of thick battles, where it would be impossible for characters to clear all squares threatened by enemies in 1 square of movement, which is required in order to use Withdraw.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-29 15:57:37)

That could work, but do you want it to have the same effects as the talent? I like the talent, but I don't think the two should be the same.
There is one thing about the talent though. How long does the effect last? I think it should probably only last until the Warrior's next turn, though I could see it only working if withdrawing is his allies' next action.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-29 16:08:14)

Hmm, IÂ´m not really sure if I want them to have the same effect. But then, there are some differences between them. But I donÂ´t know.
I seem to have left it out of the text, but the talent was meant to last only until the Warriors next turn, so that his allies could get out of trouble. IÂ´m thinking of changing it to all allies in Line of Sight though.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-12-13 16:44:41)

OK, time for an update on the progress of work again. This time with some races. I am thinking of making any "reroll" effect being keep the better result only, and was also thinking of maybe allowing racial abilities that copies the effect of a talent or feat act as a prerequistite (For example, all elves would be able to use Heightened Awareness instead of Acute Senses to qualify for Awareness talents). Thoughts?
**Humans**
Humans are the youngest race to walk the face of the world, but nevertheless the most numerous. The largest kingdoms of the world are ruled by men, and they also provides most of the grand happenings in the world. Ever expansive and hungry for power, humans have spread to all corners of the world, exploring and making wonderful discoveries. Humans are curious by nature, and they have an aptitude for learning. They can be found following any path or career, and one should never be surprised to find a human around.
**Size** Medium **Speed** 6 squares **Languages** Common **Ability Modi**fiers +2 to any one attribute
**Skilled** Humans gain one extra trained skill at 1st level
**Gifted** Humans gain one extra feat at 1st level
**Elves**
The elves is among the oldest species in the world, having existed almost since the beginning of time itself. They prefer to live in the wild, rather than in large cities of stone like humans or dwarves, and have a very close bond with nature. They are known to be skilled both with magic and the blade, as well as for their astonishing beauty and heightened senses. All elf kin tends to be slim built, with long, flowing hair in a variety of colors. Their most distinguishing physical feature is their pointy ears, and the fact that no matter their age, they all seem to look alike, as if time has no effect on an elf's appearance. There are three distinct different elven races: The Wood Elves, the Moon Elves and the Dark Elves.
**Size** Medium **Speed** 6 squares **Languages** Common and Elven **Ability Modifiers** +2 Charisma
**Low-Light Vision** Elves can ignore concealment (but not total concealment) granted by darkness
**Heightened Awareness** Elves can reroll any Perception check, and may keep the better result
**Wood Elves**
The wood elves are the most numerous and commonly seen elven race, living in great forest cities scattered across the world. They are quite adventurous and often travel outside their woodland homes to seek thrill and excitement. They are mostly blond or red-haired, and tend to be tanned. They have extremely keen senses, superior even to their own kinsfolk, and they are also known for a great skill with the bow.
**Ability Modifiers** +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution
**Keen Senses** Wood elves may make active Perception checks to notice targets as a Move action instead of a Standard action
**Weapon Proficiency** Wood elves are always proficient with the Longbow
**Moon Elves**
The moon elves are a small group of elves that have been blessed by the goddess of nature, Dina, and granted powers beyond other elves. Unlike their wooden cousins, they prefer to stay within their own societies, and only rarely do they venture out into the wider world. Those who do though, does it almost exclusively to search out ancient mysteries and lore of magic. The magic of the world runs stronger in them than in most beings, and they all tend to posses more or less innate magical gifts.
**Ability Modifiers** +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution
**Touch of Magic** Moon elves always have Arcane Magic as a class skill
**Lorekeepers** Moon elves may reroll any failed Knowledge(Arcana) check, and may keep the better result
**Dark Elves**
The dark elves were once elves just like the rest of their kin, but their reckless and intense studies of the dark arts changed them. Their evil ways caused the other elves to exile them, cast them out. This sparked an everlasting hatred for the wood and moon elves among the dark elves, and ever since, tensions have been high between the dark elves and the rest of the elves, and a state of open war is constantly in place. The dark elves have fled the forests of then kin, and instead chosen to reside in the dark swamps and bogs in the south, as well as the complexes of hills, tunnels and caverns that lies there. The dark elves have been forced by nature to become harder and more resilient than the other elves, and they have also practiced intensively in arts both magical and martial, to be able to extract their revenge on their traitorous cousins.
**Ability Modifiers** +2 Constitution
**Shadow** Dark elves may reroll any Stealth check and keep the better result, as long as they have concealment (or total concealment) granted by darkness
**Darkvision** Dark elves can ignore even total concealment granted by darkness
**Resilience** Dark elves gains a +1 racial bonus to all their defenses

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-18 22:49:11)

Okay guys, I would like your input again. One thing IÂ´m really looking for in this rpg is to have the choice of weapon and tactics to play a role in combat. For example, while superior in unarmored combat, a Greataxe might be inferior to a dagger against a heavily armored opponent. And if parrying an axe or hammer with your shield, the shield suffers a risk of being splintered.
Being a huge fan of the Fire Emblem video game series (hopefully someone recognizes it), I also like the idea that characters using different weapons may have an advantage against other weapons. Bows are naturally lethal to flying creatures as it can pierce their wings and have them crash to the ground. A character wielding a heavy axe might find himself outmaneuvered by the nimble swordmaster, but against a foe armed with a spear he has the advantage. When he gets inside the spears reach that is.
Here are some example keywords for weapons that I have come up with, give input on what you think, and suggest new ones. After each section, I give some example weapons that might have the keyword.
**Armor Piercing** â€“ Either through sheer â€punchâ€ power, or by being very easy to slip into the openings that exists in every armor, these weapons can ignore all bonus to a characters Fortitude Defense granted by a suit of armor, and only half the armors normal armor bonus to Reflex Defense (round down) will apply against these weapons. *Daggers, Heavy Crossbows, ?Rapiers?*
**Chained**  â€“ These weapons have a loose attack head attatched to their handle by a chain or strap of leather, and may more easily bend around opponents shields or parrying weapons. These weapons imposes a -5 penalty to all Parry checks made against them. *Flails, Chains(duh!)*
**Cleaving**  â€“ These weapons are very useful for breaking objects, and reduces DR on attacked objects by 10. On a critical hit, these weapons are also treated as successfully attacking any shield the opponent is wielding. *Axes, ?Hammers?*
**Crushing**  â€“ These weapons have been designed to strike hard with heavy impact, and renders even the heaviest armor all but useless against their strikes. These weapons may ignore a number of Fortitude Defense granted by a suit of armor up to the wielders Strength Modifier. *Hammers, Maces*
**Deadly**  â€“ These weapons increases their critical hit multiplier by 1 (from x2 to x3 in most cases)
**High Crit** â€“ These weapons scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, but only the 20 is an automatic hit.
**Leverage**  â€“ These weapons provides an excellent area to parry attacks with, and may be used with ease to come out of a parry in an attack. When using these weapons, a character gains a +2 equipment bonus to attack rolls made as counterattacks using the Parry skill. *Swords*
**Reach**  â€“ These weapons grants a character the ability to attack beyond his normal range. An opponent using a reach weapon grants reach as specified by the weapon. Unlike creatures who has reach because of size, the character can only attack an opponent at the edge of his reach, and he only threatens those squares, and the weapon may not be used to make Parry checks. An opponent hit by an attack of opportunity must end his movement immediately, and if readied against an opponent using the Charge action, the wielder gains a +2 equipment bonus to attack and damage rolls against that opponent. *Polearms*

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-01-19 00:11:18)

OK, hereÂ´s an add-on to the previous post that I came up with. You could of course toy with more differences in how the damage type works, but I think this could be something.
**Piercing**  â€“ Weapons that deal piercing damage typically uses a sharp point to penetrate the flesh of the opponent. Spears, arrows, crossbow bolts, daggers and thin blades all deal piercing damage. As they requires mostly agility and presicion to strike home, the base attack bonus for these weapons is determined by Dexterity. 
**Bludgeoning**  â€“ Weapons that deal bludgeoning damage typically have a massive head that can deal a massive impact capable of even shattering bones. Warhammer, maces, flails and clubs are good examples of bludgeoning weapons. Brute force is the key in using these weapons, and their base attack bonus is based on Strength.
**Slashing**  â€“ Weapons that deals slashing damage uses a sharp edge to slice through flesh and cloth to severly injure an opponent. All forms of swords and axes deal slashing damage, and pretty much any weapon that has a sharp edge does. Since they can be used very flexibly, their base attack bonus uses the higher of the wielders Strength and Dexterity.
It is possible to use a weapon to deal a type of damage that it doesnÂ´t have listed. If you would like to use a longsword to deal bludgeoning damage for instance, you can use the hilt to strike at your opponent. Using a weapon in this way causes it to deal damage dice of one size smaller than normal, and you must also adjust to the dominant attribute used by the new damage type. In certain cases though, a weapon may not be used to deal a specific type of damage. A warhammer, for instance, can never be used to deal piercing or slashing damage, as it lacks sharp edges or points.
*Example: A character wants to use a longsword (1d8 Slashing) to deal bludgeoning damage. He has a Strength score of 11 and a Dexterity of 16. When using the sword as a bludgeoning weapon, he must use his Strength modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier, thus losing 3 points on his attack roll. The sword also only deals 1d6 damage.* 
It is not flawless, for instance I imagine that Axe weapons should be Strength based, and that small, light weapons should not benefit a lot from a high strength as far as attack bonus goes. Suggestions?

Okay, first post first.  Overall, I think its very good.  I think it could really work, and, honestly, I've been looking for a system that would work like this. 
I do think the cleaving bonus is a bit high, though.  Ignoring 10 points of DR is too much.  Think if a character was attacking a door.  A cleaving weapon should smash through a wooden door easily, but should have trouble with iron doors (but less trouble than non-cleaving weapons would have).  I think that ignoring 5 points of DR would be enough.
For the second post, I like that too.  I have no problem adding those rules to weapons, but is it too complicated?  Do those rules make the weapon system *too* complex?
Small, light weapons could benefit purely from Dexterity.  You could say that all Tiny or smaller weapons automatically are based on Dexterity, despite being Bludgeoning or Slashing.  As for axes, I don't think it's a big deal.  You *could* attack with some finesse, but most characters we see wielding axes are very strong, so they use Strength, not Dexterity.

Maybe you are right, 10 was just a number I took out of the air. But now that I look I see that in Saga, 10 is the highest DR for any substance except for *beskar* and similar things. I thought something like a blast door would have more than 10, but it makes up for it in Hp instead. 5 would seem enough then yes.

I donÂ´t think it would be too much complexity. You could just remove the "Base Attack" clause from the character sheet and replace it with 3 separate entries for Slashing, Piercing and Bludgeoning weapons. Not too heavy IMO.
You are right on the aspect of weapons. Heavier weapons like a Warhammer would still favor Strength, especially with their Crushing ability.

Okay, new brainstorming. This time IÂ´m working on spells for the Dark Magic skill. To describe what it is, think Dark Side. Anything used to weaken, rotten, corrupt and torment an opponent. Certain abilities can probably be out into different skills, but thatÂ´ll be my problem. Give me your best shot. Some examples of what IÂ´ve got so far:
**Leech** - Steals life from the opponent
**Dark Power** - Through deals with dark and infernal powers, caster have gained great physical strength.
**Summon Demon** - Contact and summon a demon from hell
**Word of Death** - Speaks a word in a forbidden language, instantly killing an opponent
