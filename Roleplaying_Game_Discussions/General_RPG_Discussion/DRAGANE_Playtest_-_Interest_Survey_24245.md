# DRAGANE Playtest - Interest Survey

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-28 09:16:03)

A few of those people who frequent chat will have heard a little bit about my homebrew system DRAGANE lately, as I've been attempting to convert it from a d6 to a d% mechanic.
Well, I think the conversion may be coming together, but really who knows? Something that seems like it's working on paper might turn out to be a horribly flawed nightmare. It has occured to me that my design choices would benefit a lot from actual play data. So that's the reason for this post - if I were to run a fantasy game with my system for playtest purposes, who if anyone would be interested in playing?
A few important setting details that may affect your interest:
Cora is a broken world, the result of magickal wars that led to the Sundering - continents are separated from each other by Great Rifts, and one even floats in the sky.
Cora is a dark world, with a great deal of uncivilised territory and much to fear from monsters and otherworldy influences.
Cora is a magickal world, but has only just remembered how to be. The connection to the Dream was cut off at the time of the Sundering, and only recently opened anew. Mages are quite rare, and greatly distrusted. Also of concern are the rising number of Evolved, a new type of magick user - seemingly normal people who manifest innate power. Some of these Evolved abuse their power for villainous ends, though a portion see it as their duty to help the world despite the thanklessness of the task.

I'm interested.
...but why change it from d6? I like d6, especially the New d6. And % acts like an artificial maximum (getting better than a 100% in anything just feels weird, yet if yer an expect in something, failing 30% of the time is annoying). But, I am interested in your game, not matte the rules.

You know I'm down.

"New d6"?
And I changed it for precisely the opposite reason - d6 seemed too limiting. And I was having to use some quite quirky mechanics to get the system doing the things I wanted to do. I'm hoping d% will free things up a bit, once I've worked out how to make the changes to suit the new mechanic.
It might not work, and I might go back to d6. All depends on the playtest. You should be aware of that going in, I guess - might involve a lot of change-ups, mid-game even.
If/once enough interest is expressed, I'll post an official casting call.

Oh why not. I like rules and I like fantasy so you've got at least three now.

3 is good, but we can do better. Come on folks, roll up roll up! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Heads up - I am about 75% finished converting what I have of DRAGANE to the new mechanics. So far I really like how it's turned out, though it remains to be seen whether it's as good in play as it seems on paper. Anyways, I'll soon be ready to put up an official casting call.
While I have your attention, which would you guys rather of these three options?

1. A selection of pre-gen characters.
2. Making your own characters using the draft document.
3. The choice of either of the above.

### **Anazider** (2009-07-06 12:49:49)

Lets go with a choice of either one. I know that personally, one of the more enjoyable portions of gaming is the creation of a new character and it also helps to familiarize one with various rules and mechanics out of necessity. But I also know that for the sake of stress testing the system being able to just dive right in and shake things out is also rather desirable.
So yeah, either or suits me.

### **Valheru** (2009-07-06 17:19:35)

Option number 3 sounds good. That way people who want to make their own have example characters to help them understand the rules.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2009-07-06 19:09:14)

Seems sound. I'll also offer advice on where to look first to make your concepts work for those who don't want to trawl through everything.
I finished converting the powers (and added a couple more) just now. I'm almost certain some or even most are unbalanced (note to self - make the Toughness powers more costly), but that's what playtesting is for. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
That just leaves Equipment and Magick. Both of which are currently short sections. It's feasible that I'll have a working version of the document ready and a casting call posted by this time on the morrow.
Don't hold me to it though. Especially if I have to make pregen characters.

Hey, count the space-case in. And I am for option 3, btw.
