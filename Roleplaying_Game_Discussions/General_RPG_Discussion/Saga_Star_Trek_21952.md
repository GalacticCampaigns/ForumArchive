# Saga Star Trek

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-27 22:52:42)

Well, I had a little extra free time today, so I thought I'd go ahead and post some.
The first thing is a skill list. Star Trek is very heavily skill-based, as opposed to Star Wars, so I added in a few more. So far, I have:
[*]Acrobatics  
[*]Athletics (combining Climb, Jump, and Swim)  
[*]Business (for trade and service related skills)  
[*]Deception  
[*]Endurance  
[*]Engineer (replacing most aspects of the Mechanics skill)  
[*]Gather Info  
[*]Indoctrinate (for brain-washing, hypnotism, etc.)  
[*]Initiative  
[*]Knowledge (Bureaucracy, Culture, Galactic Lore, History, Law, Politics, Religion)  
[*]Perception  
[*]Persuasion  
[*]Pilot  
[*]Ride  
[*]Science (Life, Physical, Planetary, Social, Space)  
[*]Stealth  
[*]Survival  
[*]Tactics (replacing Knowledge [tactics])  
[*]Treat Injury  
[*]Use Computer  
[*]Psionic (for the telepathic powers, which I'll get to later)

The next rule dealt with Courage Points, a parallel easily comparable to Force Points. So, for the sake of that, I just changed the name to Courage Points and left it at that.
A Dark Side Score, though really has no place in Star Trek. However, in place of it, I have Honor. A character can have either positive Honor (if they perform honorable actions) or negative Honor (if they are dishonorable). I haven't figured out how to work it, yet, because I want to keep it simple, in the vein of the Saga rules.

I guess the next thing is the species. I stuck with their provided list for the most part, though I added Denobulan and Android, just because I could. I also removed a few I didn't like so much, like Ocampa and Regulan. I also expanded the species options, which you'll see when I get to it.
For the sake of space, I'll only list the racial traits here. Also, all the species, I think, are Medium-sized and have a 6-square speed, so I'll leave them out.
You should also know, I wasn't going for balance, just trying to convert the stats to Saga-like rules. Klingons, especially, seem to benefit from this.

### **Thraken** (2008-11-28 09:30:06)

Whoasness.
<strong>Skills</strong>
I wasn't going to add new skills as I thought it'd add more complications.
**Athletics** I can appreciate - slimming down on those skills
**Business** I was going to shove under Knowledge (bureaucracy) as Saga conversion rules seem to indicate.
**Indoctrinate** I haven't a clue as it seems to be a Decipher thing
**Science** I can understand the diversification. I was going to keep them Saga standard (life and physical sciences and technology iirc) in order to simplify things and avoid high detail scienceness. If I were to add a category I think I'd add Knowledge (weapons) for the Tactical officers and people who like to do wierd things with energy weapons.
Engineer, Tactics and Psionic are just renames so I guess I have no contention points there <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> .
<strong>DS and FPs</strong>
Aye, just a rename is good for FPs, but again for simplicity I was going to keep the DS score - but probably renamed.
It's probably something like insanity or temptation or some other word I can't think of. The idea being that if a person does bad things it weighs on them until they turn completely and become a villian - we've seen numerous officers, captains and admirals succumb to the 'dark side' in the various series for the best reasons - or simply because they went insane.
I can't remember off the top of my head, but don't characters get bonus FPs for doing something particularly heroic or something?
<strong>Races</strong>
I never liked designing races <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Decipher seems to offer some interesting details on the races, but again I was thinking of keeping the D20 based standard - e.g. the good old human with extra skill and feat.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-28 13:24:06)

I agree with Thraken. Actually, you havenÂ´t added very many skills, just renamed a few of them and split some knowledge areas up. Since you combined the athletic skills into one, you actually have less skills than SAGA. The only new one is Indoctrinate, which I think could do well as a subuse of the Persuasion and/or Deception skills.

I originally had it there too, but decided to make it its own skill, as it would include some non-bureaucratic things, like knowing how to outsell your rivals or to know how to appraise an item's value. Also, I decided that since so much of Ferengi cultutre was based around it (all of it, actually), that it at least warranted its own skill.
**Thraken wrote:**

There was some version of this skill in all the versions of the Star Trek rpg I've owned, but no really applicable Saga skill. It didn't quite fit as a type of persuasion, as it involves wholly different techniques.

That's not a bad idea. However, all the crazy things they did were all modifications to the tech, weren't they? That would be an aspect of the Engineer skill, then.

True. However -- and I probably should have said this before -- the Honor Score is not just a representation of the Dark Side Score, but the Renown Score from Decipher. Their darker tendencies could also be represented by a negative Honor Score. Just my thoughts, anyway.

I don't think so, not in Saga anyway.

I was thinking that, too, but I was just converting the Decipher rules, which had all those abilities. We just have to find a way to modify the other species, or the Humans will be significantly more underpowered than all the rest of the species.

**<span style="font-size: 0.05em;">Species Options</span>**
Currently, there are two options you may choos for your character: Mixed Species and Former Borg.
**<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">Mixed Species</span>**
Choose two species as your parents, one dominant and one subsidiary. Choose the ability modifiers and all but one species trait from the dominant species, and then only one species trait from the subsidiary species. You cannot have two abilities that have similar effects (such as Honor and Vesala).
Multi-species Betazoids are never as powerful as full Betazoids. They may substitute Empathy for Telepathy in the Telepathic species ability. Also, no multi-species can have the Ferengi Four-lobed Brain trait and the Psionic trait.
As always, these choices must be approved by the GM.
**<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">Former Borg</span>**
Apply each of the following traits to any species.
**Ability Modifiers:** +2 Strength, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma
**Bonus Feat:** Time in the Collective has improved the body functions of a former Borg. She may choose any feat as an automatic bonus feat, provided she meets the prerequisites.
**Implants:** Cybernetic implants from her time as a Borg remain in her body and can improve her senses. During character creation, choose one sense. With a DC 15 Engineer check, you can enhance that sense temporarily (like seeing into subspace or hearing ultra-high frequencies). However, the implants weren't designed to improve a sense in more than one way at a time, or to do so permanently. For every hour that the sense in enhanced, make an attack against her Fortitude Defense (1d20+5+1 for every previous hour). On a success, the former Borg moves -1 persistent step down the condition track. This condition may only be removed by resetting the sense to normal (DC 15 Engineer check) and resting for eight hours. Anytime a former Borg takes damage from a critical hit, an implant is damaged. The implants are difficult to repair requiring a DC 20 Engineer check.
**Nanoprobes:** As long as a former Borg retains her implants, her body will continue to manufacture Borg nanoprobes, which have a variety of functions.
**Regenerate:**Instead of sleeping, the Borg must regenerate in a Borg alcove, but for a six-hour cycle. In she does not do so every eighteen hours, her implants begin to fail. Make an attack (1d20+10) against her Fortitude Defense every ten minutes past the eighteen hours. On a success, she takes 3d6 damage. On a failure, she takes 1d6 damage.

### **Thraken** (2008-11-30 10:42:51)

After some light skimming of the saga book, I've gotten to the vehicles section.
It seems to me that there a many adjustment that needs to be made to the standards of the system rather than just making straight vehicle conversions.
[*]DEX, armor and INT may need to be adjusted. Generally if a ship is still it's a sitting duck and will get a pounding. As soon as it starts to move the attacker starts missing hits. Applying to all ships on screen it seems like most ships have good INT and DEX compared to Star Wars  
[*]Condition Track. Yes its a simple system, but it means it needs work since in Star Trek they like to aim at certain ship systems.  
[*]Related to the above - Damage thresholds have gotta come way down if we're gonna have any "oh no something's offline" moments  
The rest I have some vague ideas about. :

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-30 14:17:18)

INT definitely need a big boost, but the other two . . . I don't know. Armor may be fine. DEX really depends on the size of the ships. I was always under the impression that Star Trek ships were much smaller then Star Wars ones, since smaller ships have a higher DEX.
When comparing a Galaxy-class ship to a Star Destroyer, I always thought the Galaxy-class was half the size. Of course, I don't have the faintest idea how big a Galaxy-class really is, so maybe I'm mistaken.

---

### **Thraken** (2008-11-30 16:24:00)

Fortunately for you - and probably unfortunately for me - I'm a geek >_>
Galaxy is 600m ish so is half the length and a fraction of the volume or tonnage.
I agree that size should be a factor in defining DEX, but Star Trek 'capital' ships seem to consistently be more maneuverable than those seen in Star Wars. Even a Galaxy class pulls turns in a few seconds while the all the ships in RotJ were a lot slower. Even in combat ships prefer to stay in motion and can perform successful evasive maneuvers to dodge fire, whereas the Star Wars thing appears to be ye old battleship style moving in formation and slugging at each other.
The top end appears to be the Defiant - it can dodge fire and perform stunts - Star Wars corvettes and similar sized ships don't do that.
Fighters and shuttles in Star Trek are sluggish and slow compared to starships though.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-30 21:15:33)

Yes, I was right!
Maybe all Star Trek capital ships are built with Maneuvering Jets, which can add up to +6 to it's Dexterity, and maybe combat thrusters for some of the smaller ones.
Anyway, I have my Decipher book here in front of me. Assuming it's right, the Defiant is about the same size as a Corellian Corvette. It would definitely have to have the maneuvering jets to do what it does on screen. I think it should have combat thrusters, too. By the rules it wouldn't do any good, so we have to do something about that. The Defiant also has ablative armor, which will give its Reflex Defense a nice boost, but it wouldn't be enough.

### **Rebaav** (2008-12-01 07:52:54)

Something else to consider is an episode of ST:TNG where Worf reported on a ship taking aggressive posture to them:
"They've targetted us with... LASERS!" in the tone, if he wasn't looking at a sensor display he rather trusted, would have been "you're kidding right" but tilted in the direction of "they can't possibly be serious." Riker then commented that the most mundane of their mobility systems, their navigation deflector IIRC, could handle that just through standard operation. (ie: the Enterprise is operational: they don't even notice)
Voyager then introduced Photon Weapons and ... <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: -->

### **Thraken** (2008-12-01 08:53:27)

Hmm... dunno if +3 to ref def gives it enough. Not that experienced with the hard numbers. The INT and DEX adjustments I was thinking of increasing the base stats on stock ships rather than just using the starship rules. The rules were designed for Star Wars not Star Trek after all so we'd probably have to tweak the numbers to fit in.
As for the Ablative armour I was thinking of having it as a third form of damage reduction and having it operate similar to base SAGA shields. This is because it reduces damage from being hit but can eventually be penetrated. Probably can't be repaired till reaching a space station.
@Rebaav
Voyager? Photon weapons? You mean the silly thing that the Doctor dreamed up that doesn't actually exist?

I agree. Star Trek shields seem huge compared to Star Wars but work the same way, basically, as Saga shields. As they are depleted the offer less protection & seem to be the primary ship defense. The ships still lurch as if they've been hit whether the sheilds are there or not. To emulate that I would expect enormous DR and Threshold since after a fight they seem usually ok, though when things go bad those ships take crazy punishment (HPs). Example I can point to is Enterprise when the Zindy were wailin on it. They were picking that ship to death bit by bit.
For Star Trek the ability to bypass armour plating and target systems seems to be the advanced sensors and targetting systems. I expect that would manifest as a reduction of threshold (there's a prestige class gunner that does that in Saga I think). From there some additional mechanic would need to be introduced to disable the specified system itself, I'd think.

Sounds like a great way to portray the Defiant and the mystical anti-borg armour from the future (sounds awsome doesn't it? <!-- s:roll: -->![:roll:](https://i.ibb.co/79WrFM7/icon-rolleyes.gif)<!-- s:roll: --> ).
I'm still confused why armour wasn't done exactly this way in DnD4e, seemed like a great way to do it. *shrug*. Seemed like a wasted opportunity to me.
> Voyager? Photon weapons? You mean the silly thing that the Doctor dreamed up that doesn&#39;t actually exist?

Yeah, that was funny. Daydreams and the Dreaded. Photonic. Cannon. Nice take on hacking gone awry. I also enjoyed the hacking vs AIs portrayals in Andromeda.
No, I'm refering to the other examples. One in particular where this arms dealer was falsly accused of something and was on the run. His Little ship had a capacitated photon cannon that really knocked Voyager around and a photon burst that scrambled their sensors. He overcharged and blew himself up. Another is photon grenades designed to wipe out holographic stuff. Photon tech and creatures seemed to be a staple of the show and the universe. FPS games. Cannonical fiction. FanFic. Throughout all this I would think "Aren't they just laser tech?" *shrug*.

### **Thraken** (2008-12-03 14:43:28)

Hard to say on endurance. Single torpedoes or disruptor blasts have destroyed ships in one hit on several occasions.
I think Armor as DR was an RCR thing. I have no idea why everything is still working as armour bonus though.
Photon Weapons - meh, Voyager has more technobabble than all other series -_-
Anyway, I had drafted a Starfleet Officer class to replace the Jedi class in the conversion. As starfleet are the wonderboys of Star Trek much like the Jedi are in star wars <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

A 1st-level Starfleet Officer starts play with 3d4Ã—250 credits.
The following I'm not so sure about. Talents and the precise contents of the starfleet training feat are up in the air and were one of the main things I wanted a crack at the Decipher books for.
Starfleet training feat is simply basic training. Generic crewman we can just tape the feat to some nonheroic levels and we're set.
**Feat: Starfleet Training**
Gain two Skill focus, training or proficiency related to vocation
Command Knowledge: Bureaucracy, Pilot
Engineering: Mechanics, Use Computer, Knowledge: Technology
Security: Weapon Proficiency: Rifles, Heavy Weapons, Knowledge: Tactics, Persuasion, Perception
Medical: Treat Injury, Knowledge: Life Sciences, Knowledge: Social Sciences
Science (requires Starfleet officer levels): Linguist, Use Computer, Knowledge (any)
The following are mostly unsorted. As well as a Starfleet training tree there should probably be a tree for each of the departments. Talents would also be a good opportunity to take up Decipher functions that Saga doesn't have.
**Starfleet Training Talent Tree** 
Academy Extension Courses
Choose 1+INT class skills.
If the skill is knowledge or requires training to use, you may use it untrained. If the skill has no trained requirement or only has some trained uses you gain a +5 bonus to untrained uses.
You may take this talent multiple times
Academy Training
Gain the benefits of the starfleet training feat again. In addition an officer's choices are not limited by department and have more options as listed
Command: Knowledge (any)
Engineering: Knowledge (physical sciences)
Security: Endurance, Gather Information, Stealth
Medical: Cybernetic Surgery, Surgical Expertise
All: Knowledge (Bureaucracy)
This may only be taken once
Security Training
Deception becomes a class skill. You may choose to become trained in Deception, Stealth or Gather Information
Flight Control Training
Starship tactics become available as a bonus feat. Gain a starship tactics feat
Starship Combat
Once per encounter you may direct other pilots that can hear and understand you as a standard action to give them the bonuses of one of your Expert pilot talents.
Effect lasts until end of encounter
Starship Maneuvers
Once per encounter when you use a maneuver you may direct other pilots that can hear and understand you the ability to use the same maneuver once on their next turn. They must make pilot checks or attack rolls as needed.

> Hard to say on endurance. Single torpedoes or disruptor blasts have destroyed ships in one hit on several occasions.

Coupe de gras I think that is called right?
If you've got someones shield freq and you've fully targetting them and they are sitting still for you, you get dead Enterprise from the movie Generations. (One example)

### **Anonymous** (2008-12-03 17:18:54)

I have the Decipher books, so I can post some of the abilities and their effects. There was a Starship Officer class, which had what was effectively a talent tree for every position (Commander, Flight Control Officer, Engineer, Counselor, yada, yada, yada).
And there are a few things about your class:
1) Starfleet officers are supposed to be amazingly skilled. I think they should get more than 3+Int trained skills.
2) The Starfleet Training feat and Academy Training talent confuse me. Can you clarify them a bit?
3) Are we using my skill list? If so, your list should be slightly different. If not, yours seems right.

---

### **Thraken** (2008-12-03 18:16:37)

I suppose - just need to mod coup de gras so it works on vehicles and objects :P
But what defines helpless then? I mean DS9 happily blows up klingon warships with single torpedoes.
Academy Training and Starfleet Training feat are just as they say on the tin.
Basically they allow you to gain two feats to go towards whatever department you sign up for in star fleet. Having the feat represents basic training, hence npcs with the feat are standard crewmen. It also allows first level officers to get potentially two skill focuses or relevant skills or feats etc. Which could also apply if someone enters starfleet 'late' in their adventuring career and this gets them training for their job.
Academy training is an unrestricted upgrade which represents whatever the person majored in at the academy.
I was unsure about the starting number of skills as the above potentially gives up to 4 skills.
As for the skills, it's just naming really - My notes used normal saga skill list.
Edit 1:
Finally I'm actually having some troubles with SR. Star Trek shields do not gradually drain off but lose chunks of shield integrity depending on how bad a hit they recieve.
Another conflict with SR is the fact that as long as they have shields the ship generally has a fighting chance. It's when they lose shields that they start waving their arms around screaming and panicking. The SR model afaik allows for ships to take heavy damage or be destroyed when SR is at lower levels.
Any thoughts on adjusting the system to fit this?
Edit 2: Here's a drafty idea.
Any damage that has been reduced by SR is halved before affecting other damage reduction, damage threshold and HP.
For every ten points of damage you exceed the SR, you deplete the shields by an additional 5 SR.
Conformal shielding:
Once per encounter - when you raise shields for the first time in an encounter you may use a move action to raise conformal shields.
Against this configuration shields are depleted by an addition 5 SR per twenty points of damage that exceeds SR.
This does not halve any damage that leaks through shields.

### **Thraken** (2009-05-12 16:02:34)

Because of a certain Abrams I went and had a look at this again.
For SAGA Star Trek, I decided to throw all the complicated crap I had previously done and do this.
> <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Starfleet Academy Training**</span>
> **Benefit:** All skills except Use the Force become class skills. In addition, choose any talent tree. You are always able to choose talents from this
> talent tree regardless of what class you are taking a level in. Starfleet Talents also become available.
> **Normal:** Skills and talents are limited to those available to the class whose level you are taking
> **Special:** You can take this feat multiple times; each time you take the feat you gain access to a different talent tree. Of Prestige Class talent trees only the following are available: Naval Officer, Military Tactics, Expert Pilot, Gunner, Gunslinger, Carbineer, Protection, Enforcement, Infiltration, Military Engineer, Advanced Medicine

Starfleet Talents is a placeholder because goddamn there are so many talents around already! If Starfleet talents are ever made they probably deal with obscure abilities seen in any incarnation of Star Trek that aren't covered in SAGA.

There any interest in Star Trek or am I just suppressing my ADHD mind? <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
> **Vulcan**
> **Ability Modifiers:** STR +2, CON +2, WIS +2, CHA -4. Vulcans originate from an arid desert world with many predators leading to the evolution of superior physical attributes. Their millenia old cultural adherence to logic and discipline however makes it difficult for them to empathise with most races in the Galaxy.
> **Quick Reflexes:** +1 species bonus to reflex defense
> **Special Powers:** Use the Force is a class skill and Vulcans may make use of the Use the Force Skill as follows.
> *Activate Force Power (Trained Only):* May take force training feat once and can select mind affecting powers, however range is limited to 4 squares and time to Full round action.
> *Sense Force (Untrained):* This applies only to very close friends, relatives and companions or a great disturbance of a large number of Vulcans. Last paragraph of this use does not apply.

> **Antennae:** An andorian may make a DC15 endurance check as a full round action in order to ignore cover and concealment for perception checks to detect or observe targets. Increase DC by 5 if used against targets with total cover.
> **Blood Surge:** Once per day an Andorian can fly into a rage as a swift action, while raging the Andorian temporarily gains a +2 rage bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls but cannot use skills that require patience and concentration such as Mechanics, Stealth or Use the Force. Alternatively this may be used to give a +5 competence bonus to all wisdom based skills. Feats that apply to Rage are applicable to this trait.

> **Orion**
> *Male*
> **Ability Modifiers:** STR +2, CON +2, WIS -2, CHA -2. Male orions tend to towards brutish behaviour and are selfishly pragmatic.
> **Deceptive:** May reroll deception check but must take the second result even if worse

The Attack modifier is equal to character level plus charisma modifier. If the attack equals or beats the target&#39;s will defense, that target moves -1 step down the condition track. When the target is reduced to -5 on the condition track, instead of falling unconscious the target&#39;s attitude improves to friendly. Female creatures can only be moved one step down on the condition track by such an effect.
> **Competition:** Female humanoid creatures gain a +5 gender bonus to resisting Orion pheramones.

> **Great Fortitude:** While not on the level of natural armor, their tough build results in greater pain tolerance. +2 species bonus to Fortitude Defense.
> **Eidetic Memory:** Cardassians as a race possess eidetic memory. They may roll any knowledge check twice and take the better roll.

> **Ferengi**
> **Ability Modifiers:** STR +2, CON -2, INT +2, CHA -2. While cunning and strong for their size, they possess a smaller frame than most species and tend towards cowardliness or self preservation.

<strong>Melee Weapons</strong>
*Tiny*
**D'k tahg**, 1d4, 1kg, Slashing or Piercing, +2 equipment bonus to grapple checks. As a knife it is sufficiently balanced for throwing.
*Small*
**Ahn-woon**, special, 1kg, Bludgeoning or Crushing.
Allows to initiate a grab or grapple at range. You can use the Pin and Trip feats as with a net. If performing a melee grapple or grab you may choose to deal unarmed damage if successful. Performing at range always deals unarmed damage. In conjunction with Crush or Throw (melee range only), when dealing unarmed damage you may increase the damage die by one step.
<strong>Ranged Weapons</strong>
Ranged weapons in Star Trek are largely homogeneous with similar effects and fire-power. Thus all weapons should possess similar characteristics to their Saga edition analogues. Modern energy weapons - phasers in particular - are capable of acting as tools. GMs should allow uses that involve cutting, heating, melting, excavation and the the like depending on how advanced the weapon is.
*Tiny*
**Concussion Grenade**, 4d6, Stun, 0.5kg, Energy, Military
**Photon Grenade**, 8d6, 0.75kg, Energy, Military
**Pressure Grenade**, 4d6, 0.5kg, Bludgeoning, Military
*Medium*
**Dominion Plasma Rifle,** 3d8, S A, 3kg, Energy, Rare Military, Inaccurate
If a Dominion plasma weapon deals damage that exceeds the target creature's damage threshold, it cannot naturally recover HP and takes a 1d20+5 attack against its fortitude defence every round. On a successful roll it takes 1d4 damage and moves -1 down the condition track. If unsuccessful the creature only takes half damage and does not move down the condition track. This can be treated with a medical kit or suitable medicine and a DC 15 Treat Injury check.
<strong>Energy Weapon Types</strong>
**Advanced:** Typically possess four settings and also allow a Use Computer check instead of a mechanics in order to modify it or perform special functions.
**Antiquated:** Either due to age or simple operation these possess no advantages compared to base Saga edition blaster weapons. Particularly old weapons may even deal reduced damage (by one die or step)
**Plasma:** See Antiquated Energy Weapons, however some high density weapons also inflict great pain due to plasma burns. A target moved down the condition track by this type of weapon can only spend 2 swift actions per turn to recover. This effect lasts until recovered to normal state.
**Phasers:** Tend toward more effective stun settings. Increase stun damage (either by one die or one step).
**Disruptors:** Tend toward being more effective at destroying targets. Target damage threshold is considered 5 less than normal.
**Tetryon:** If a burst or area attack, any technological equipment including carried items and cybernetic devices within the area are subject to ion damage
<strong>Fire modes</strong>
**Autofire:** Many energy weapons capable of 'autofire' can fire beams instead of blasts.
**Beam:** Beams may make a 1x4 square area attack. As a full round action this may also be used on a single target with a -5 attack penalty in order to gain penetration 5 against shields and damage reduction. This use consumes 10 shots (or 5 with burst fire feat)
**Disruption:** This setting treats its target's damage threshold as 5 lower than it actually is. If this damage is lethal and kills or destroys a target it discorporates. This use consumes 20 shots.
**Stun:** Stun weapons in Star Trek are more prevalent and effective than in Star Wars. The effective range of weapons with a stun setting is up to short range, or point blank for inaccurate weapons. Stun settings consume much less power and shot use is reduced by two saga scale steps. (i.e. 20, 10, 5, 2)
**Wide Beam:** This setting allows the phaser to deliver its effect as a 6 square cone area attack. This use consumes 20 shots (or 10 with Spray Shot feat)

### **Rebaav** (2009-06-02 10:43:55)

I recall a speech that Kira gave (DS9) comparing a federation rifle to a Cardassian model that had only stun and kill settings, nothing else. Her praising the simplicity of a weapon from a people she didn't like so much vs the federation which had much more that could go wrong with it and so on. It was a neat moment!

### **Thraken** (2009-06-02 12:16:23)

GM dependant :P
But yeah, I think it's the typical high tech vs. simplicity argument. Starfleet is consistently given the best toys after all.
And it was a good moment. "Their guns are good. We stole em and had much fun shooting them up."
Stolen starfleet goods could probably be deactivated at range unless the weapon was stripped or something <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Communicator**
Personal communicators have an unimpeded line of sight range of thousands of kilometers, though planetary conditions tend to cut this down by a factor of five or more. Communicators of this size are tiny devices and may be carried in some manner or worn on the person. These devices tend to have some limited controls for performing communications related Use Computer checks. It is standard for these communications devices to have a locator function for the purpose of assisting site to pad transport locks.
**Com Badge**
A fine object, typically equipped with no controls beyond an activation switch. As well as the standard locator function they are typically equipped with a DC10 Universal Translator (verbal real time function) and due to lack of controls cannot be used to perform Use Computer checks alone. Starfleet models have a range of 500 kilometers and by a DC10 mechanics check or if damaged continually broadcast a distress beacon.
**Subspace Communicator**
A medium sized communications tablet capable of transmitting and recieving video at faster than light speeds for several light years. Such items are used are also used as highly portable beacons on escape pods and in field kits.
**Subspace transmitter**
Small sized (character scale) transmitter that may be removed from a small craft's systems and operated independantly. Such devices possess a much longer range due to much higher speed communications, thus the use of these are preferred in emergencies
**PADD**
PADDs are far more advanced than their Datapad analogues in Star Wars. They are essentially computers in a pad design and are available in sizes ranging from a palm sized unit to a large easel sized panel. These may be computer devices with Intelligence scores of up to 14 whose programs are limited only by the input/output space on the PADD. Various models may possess a variety of extra functions such as internal communicators for interfacing with computer services, a voice recorder or video recorder.
Portable desktop computer terminals are also available and may have Intelligence scores of as high as 16.
**Palm beacon** (See glowrod)
In addition to handheld palm beacons (small or tiny in size), there are models that may be worn on the body for handsfree use. These are known as Sims Beacons (small in size).
**Tricorder**
A Tricorder allows the user to see and find properties of the environment and entities that otherwise would not be seen by the naked eye. Simple or civilian scanners do not require a use computer check to use and give a +2 equipment bonus to Knowledge (Physical Sciences) and Knowledge (Technology). With a standard action DC15 Use Computer check the +2 equipment bonus also applies to perception. More advanced models may instead provide a +5 equipment bonus if used properly. Many models of tricorder also possess computer function and communications equipment in order to transmit and recieve data with a larger computer system. Tricorders are standard equipment on Starfleet away missions, even if their only function is to record mission logs and recall information from databases. Some organisations have similar devices, but for medical purposes instead. These Tricorders range from small to medium in size.
**Medical Scanner**
A tiny diagnostic device that produces a summary of vital signs (See MDS-50 Medisensor). Swift action on adjacent creature or character, shows current HP, its condition track and the presence of diseases, poison or radiation exposure. When used in conjunction with a Tricorder, the doctor may use it's equipment bonus on Knowledge (Life Science) checks to diagnose the problem.
**Federation Tricorder**
Modern federation tricorders are highly advanced and versatile systems far beyond other models.
An early model has similar properties to the older tricorders but also possessed a hand scanner that may be used to increase the equipment bonus to +5.
The next model possesses a +5 equipment bonus as standard, thus doing away with hand scanners. This vastly upgraded unit possesses expanded computer functions on a level similar to a high spec PADD (though limited by a small screen), a holographic projector and a DC10 Universal translator (verbal and written). Among the functions it could perform, it is possible to perform passive scanning to minimise interference with the target (reduces equipment bonus to 2) and lock to continually scan even while closed and stowed. (Take 10 Use Computer Check with a +2 equipment bonus for the duration of the scan).
These tricorder may be used to perform limited medical scans (reduce equipment bonus by one step), however Medical Tricorders can always apply it's equipment bonus to Knowledge (Life Science) and its hand scanner also functions as a medical scanner.
The most advanced tricorder fielded is essentially a fully equipped PADD equipped with a sensor suite. It can performs all the functions of a standard and a medical tricorder without need of a hand scanner.
**Medkit**
A small or medium case filled with basic medical equipment, typically carried by a medical practitioner on a mission. Older kits possess a field hypospray, a Medical Scanner, Simple tools (such as tweezers, cutters etc.) and a Spray Applicator (Equivalent to a medpac).
A more modern kit contains a medical tricorder instead of a medical scanner and a dermal regenerator (Two medpac uses, powered by two energy cells) instead of a spray applicator.
**Field Hypospray**
The standard hypospray is a jet injector for drugs that may be loaded with vials of various drugs. The field or emergency version is a preloaded with a variety of general purpose drugs that include: a one use stimulant for Revivify use (trained only), Several doses in order to gain a +5 drug bonus to resist disease, poison, radiation or to endurance for 8 hours and several doses of Knock out drops and paralytic poison.
**Field Medical Kit**
A medium-large case carried via a sling. This is effectively a Medical Kit minus the repulsorlift stretcher and with a medical tricorder, field hypospray, field hypospray refills and the equivalent of three medpac uses. These are usually placed in strategic locations by well equipped organisations for emergency use.
**Tactical Forcefield Generator**
A relatively uncommon forcefield generator possessed by galactic military forces. These forcefield generators are dimunutive items that generate a two square wide or one diagonal adjacent physical barrier. Their performance ranges from SR 5 for low power models to SR 15 for the best models. If a forcefield generator takes double its normal shield rating in damage it overloads with the shield failing and the generator disabled (at 0 HP)
**Forcefield Generator**
These forcefield generators are small items that may be freestanding or mounted on a surface. They can generate up to twelve squares or six diagonals of physical barrier within a 6 square radius. These range from SR5 at the most basic level up to SR25 for battlefield models. If a forcefield generator takes double its normal shield rating in damage it overloads with the shield failing and the generator disabled (at 0 HP)

Neat. I really like how the SR system works as an ablative system and I find so many systems need and lack that.
I think, based on how this reads, I can intuit which devices I've seen in the shows are what are presented here but is there a structure/timeline here? Is it the order? Evolution of the communicator to the comm badge for example? Have you considered or implimented an Era timeline?

---

### **Thraken** (2009-06-18 10:31:43)

Indeed, the SR system of Saga is good. Of course with Star Trek's tendency to provide total blocking shields this is tweaked a little.
A guide as to which era uses what I guess I haven't considered. Will want to put out the rest of the material first before writing up the "Era's of Play" material. Star Trek kinda depends on its ships. (Though the computer games did spam that aspect far too much)
One issue I'm having trouble with atm is Damage Thresholds for starships. Star Trek has a lot of fun with knocking out one system or another, but I don't know how easy it is to move starships down the condition track in Saga. I'm also wondering whether to include a guide for attacking specific systems or leave the GM to wing it.

I've seen the opposite in the series. The ships seem to thrash around and stuff breaks all over long before the shields are down to zero from what I've seen. As soon as I read how Saga SR worked it occured to me that any ablative protection would be emulated great that way including STrek shields.

Ok, that makes sense. I have an easier time reading tech when I can place it in an evolutionary timeline.

DS9 introduced ablative armour: a physical SR. I think we talked about this before where it seems the ships abilities work the same as comic books in that it's "up to the authors moods" about what happens. The seem to have an unexhaustable pool of HPs. Given the, suposed, triple redundancy of the control systems on star fleet ships they'd have to endure collasal punishment before systems start dropping off but they do that, seemingly, with writer fiat ease. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I've spotted both actually. While at times there may be dramatic and edgy console sparking, shields can be pretty good. There are many instances of getting hit with shields losing large chunks of power at once but with no real damage or trouble till the shields are completely out.
I guess I'll leave the systems part. maybe the GM can randomly disable a system if there's condition track movement. But again, how hard is it to move ships down condition tracks when their damage thresholds are in the region of 150 to 250+?

I've seen many situations where that's not the case. It's crazy amounts of punishment but sytems still get effected. WHen the shields go down though, indeed, it seems that systems are barely taped to the targets.

There are some talents that seem to be present in STrek, the ones that increase HP damage and threshold damage, emulated by technology (targeting computers that allow â€œcalled shot warp coreâ€ etc). That would probably be a good place to start. Shields are huge, yes, I agree but the ships themselves donâ€™t seem to have any more in the way of Threshold or Damage Reduction than SW Saga ships do. When the shields are down itâ€™s a dramatically bad moment every time but by then the ship has already been pounded into submission by what the sheilds leak anyway and that happens a LOT. It's those weapons that cut through or take away shields that mess them up everytime. That individual systems seem to be affected, I think, is more storytelling then anything else. I've seen in other systems where effects are targetted to specific parts of a person/vechicle. An attack against the INT of a SW Saga ship would be damage to their targetting systems, for example.

Some draft vehicle rules then
**Characters in Vehicles**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**First Officer:** A first officer can perform all the same actions as the commander, though only if the commander hasn't performed that same action since the end of the First Officer's last turn. A ship can only have one first officer at a time.
**Tactical Officer:** A tactical officer controls the weapons and defenses of the starship. He may also apply special gunner attacks. A ship can only have one tactical officer at a time. A Tactical Officer is considered a gunner if manually controlling weapons and thus able to use his own base attack bonus.

</details>

**Vehicle Combat Actions**
**Standard Action**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

**Attack with vehicle weapon**
A Tactical officer's command to attack typically involves instructing the ships computer to make the attack, thus the Computer's Base Attack Bonus is used for these attacks.
A Tactical officer's attack action applies to weapons he has queued and may apply special attacks from feats, talents or gunner maneuvers.

</details>

**Move Action**
**Queue Weapons**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tactical Officer Only
A tactical officer may designate targets for up to an entire battery of weapons as a move action. Narrow Salvo, Proximity Spread and Focus fire may be used as normal.
If targeting multiple ships only up to the starship's INT mod number of targets may be designated. Computer operated targets use the starship computer's base attack bonus instead of the officer's.
Each queue weapons action requires a DC15 Use Computer check. This action is not permitted if the Tactical Officer is utilising manual fire.

</details>

**Swift Action**
**Concentrate Fire**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Tactical Officer Only
If attacking a single target in a round, may firelink another weapon system or weapons of a single type as a swift action.
This may be used for example to fire torpedoes and phasers in the same attack action, using the same attack die roll and applying the appropriate modifiers for the second weapon system.
This may be also be used during manual fire to link additional weapons of one type to an attack.

</details>

**Shields**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Older starships use shield configurations similar to Star Wars Saga edition. This is known as conformal shielding.
Modern starships generally prefer to use a bubble type configuration. These shields halve the damage that passes to the hull while in operation, however their strength is reduced by 5 for every 10 points of damage that exceeds the SR in addition to the normal depletion.
Modern starships may change the shield geometry between the two with a DC20 Use Computer check. Performing this when the shields are down allows a +5 circumstance bonus to the check.
Shields in Star Trek tend to be more complete than shielding in Star Wars, only in certain circumstances do effects ignore SR.
Examples include actions related to shield frequencies in order to improve repulsion or reduce its effect or exotic universal phenomena.

</details>

**Structural Integrity Fields**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Rather than thick and dense armor, most races in Star Trek use an energy field to help maintain hull integrity. When moved down the condition track, the penalties also apply to DR.

</details>

**Warp speed travel**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The command to enter warp speed is a move action and the jump occurs at the beginning of the pilot's next round. The course may be plotted before or after entering warp and generally destinations are retrieved from the ship's computer or another computer service. If no data is available then determining the course may require use computer and knowledge checks to calculate - perhaps requiring a minor encounter in itself.
Quantifying warp speeds is a difficult proposition as increasing warp factors actually mean a vast increase in speed conforming to a complicated equation. For the purposes of this a simplified system will be used.
One sector is roughly 20 light years across. It takes (Die roll) weeks to cross that distance at a certain warp speed. For shorter distances reduce the number as desired or multiply for longer distances.
**Warp Factor** Die
**1.x** d100
**2.x** d20
**3.x** d12
**4.x** d10
**5.x** d8
**6.x** d6
**7.x** d4
**8.x** d3
**9.x** d2
**10** -

</details>

**Asteroids and Damaging Environments**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

All warp capable ships are equipped with navigational deflectors to protect ships from space hazards. These provide a +5 equipment bonus for the pilot when dealing with Asteroids, Debris, Other objects and Dust Clouds. Some ships (typically starfleet) possess dedicated navigational deflectors that provide a +10 equipment bonus.

Nice. I look forward to gameplay examples!
