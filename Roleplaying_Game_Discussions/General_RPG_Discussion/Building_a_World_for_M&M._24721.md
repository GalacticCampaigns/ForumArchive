# Building a World for M&M.

I was wondering if you where going to build a world for Mutants and Masterminds. Would you use stuff from Comic Book which is where most Supers ideas come from. Would make something completely your own? What would you do? The reason I am asking this is cause I am going to be running a supers game in a few weeks and I have been thinking about switching to M&M 3rd ed. when it hits this year. And I also want to make a world where Marvel and DC's heroes are there.
Now should use all of the heroes in both Universes, or pick and choose? Use all events or just the ones that fit? I know this has been done on the Forums on the Atomic Think Tank. But I want to do this for here sense we are branching out into other games. Your thoughts please.
