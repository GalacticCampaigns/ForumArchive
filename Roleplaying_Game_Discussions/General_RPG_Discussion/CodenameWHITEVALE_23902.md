# Codename:WHITEVALE

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-12 19:05:07)

<span style="font-size: 0.50em;">(I feel really bad about spamming, but here goes&#8230;)</span>
I still have slots open for my 4e pbp game (now "Codename:WHITEVALE"). I had several people express interest at first, but once I started casting, no one replied. There are still 2 or 3 slots ready to be filled (character creation guidelines in the thread).
Once again, sorry for advertising, but I feel that people have forgotten about the never-used subforum.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-04-13 09:05:12)

If- and I don't remember if I did- express interest, I was wrong to do so. If I didn't...well, my current job doesn't allow the time, internet access and routine schedule to allow me to play. Sorry.

Smack.
Right, sorry, still understanding the rules for D&D 4.0. Got the book, just don't really understand it yet. Still working on it. Probably a cleric for boosting the other party members.

God, this looks fun. Would that I had the book. Sadly, I'll be doing good to get all the Sage Edition books I'm missing. But, hopefully I'll get a bit more money coming in soon, so maybe if you're still casting by then I could join. Doesn't look likely, though. -_-

Background info buried in the Casting Calls thread. Link: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic. &#8230; 500#p26500](http://galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic.php?p=26500#p26500 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic.php?p=26500#p26500")<!-- m -->
Sketchpad, those ideas look neat. Note that Korihor is place a cleric, and Anthrax is already playing a Fighter(multi-Warlock), so we already have the leader and defender covered. The rogue is probably the best, to round out the party, but you can play whatever you want.
Also, dragonborn are pretty rare in Whitevale, so if you do go with the dragonborn, I'm going to go ahead and take that option off for future characters.

Heya Rev ... I'm good with the Rogue if that's what you need <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> If you'd like me to play something else, just let me know <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-26 08:06:05)

Hey, here's a quick question. If I am able to join in (which is looking much more likely thanks to the wonders of free downloads <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->) what do you guys still need? I was originally thinking ranger, but if sketchpad's playing a rouge would something like wizard be more useful?

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-26 08:51:48)

Depends on the rolls to be filled. So far, as I've seen it, we have;
Defender - Anthrax
Striker - Sketchpad
Leader - Korihor ::)
So, we *could* use a controller to take out large swaths of enemies and the such. But, what do you **want** to play? That is the question. Right next to, what does the **DM** want you to play? ;D

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-26 08:55:34)

Well, after reading through the Wizard's options, I'd definitely have to say Wizard, which is handy since that happens to be the one you need. ^^

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-26 15:58:42)

**Backstory** Gasarmis is an unusual Eladrin. He has a minimal, nearly nonexistent knowledge of his race, due to a trauma he suffered as a young child. This unknown event caused his amnesia and almost completely removed his connection to the Feywild. He ended up in the village of Whitevale, where he was taken in by a family of Elves, who assumed he was also an Elf.
As he got older, he gained access to and began studying the vast library of Whitevale's School. He began his training in his chosen profession, Wizard. As he studied the ancient texts, however, he began to have suspicions about his true race. He read about the Eladrin's ability to slip in and out of the Feywild nearly at will, and on a whim, tried it himself. He found he was able to achieve the teleportation like effect of the technique called the â€œFey Step.â€ However, when he tried to slip away from the real world for a more extended period, he found he was unable to, as if something was anchoring him to the real world. Determined to find out what, he set out on an adventure to discover the truth about himself, and what happened to him all those years ago.
**Appearance** Gasarmis has white hair, with a slightly blueish tint, that is abnormally short for his race at only slightly more than shoulder length. His eyes are viridian, and always on the move, never looking at one thing for more than a few seconds unless he finds it interesting. He is thin, even by his races standards, but what bulk he has is all muscles.

### **Sketchpad** (2009-04-26 22:15:50)

**Name:** Boone
Boone's always been a bit of a city rat. At a young age, he was abandoned to an orphanage, but even that couldn't keep him long. For years, he spent time learning what he could from one person or another. In the darkest alleys, he learned there were alternatives to honest work. While working a nearby carnival, he found that his speed was better suited for acrobatics, rather than just running. And when pursed by the occasional watch guard, he discovered that he wasn't bad with his hands ... or with a sword for that matter. While others spoke of life and duty, Boone dreamed of adventure and riches.
Eventually, the day came where he realized that there was more to life than making a quick gold piece here and there. As he sat in a tavern, he'd overheard some people talk about their latest adventure and how they'd made good money from it. This sparked an idea in Boone. If he could work as an adventurer-for-hire, he might make some extra coin. Determined, he's now set out to make a life as an adventurer ... with maybe making some extra gold on the side.
**PHYSICAL TRAITS**
**Ht:** 5'9"
**Wt:** 172 lbs.
**Hair:** Black
**Eyes:** Gray
**Physical Description:** Dressed in black and dark-brown leather armor, Boone is a handsome man with a sly smile and mischievous eyes. Standing around average for a human, he tends to keep the point of his ears hidden under his shaggy hair and likes to keep a healthy tan color to his skin. More often than not, he has some scruff trying to grow on his chin ... though it never grows more than that.

Ok, added my backstory. Could be better, yes, but I'm tired and am working on pseudo-writer's block. Still, plenty of areas left open for a creative DM to make some interesting stories out of. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> Also, I'd really like you guys to confirm that I got everything right with my character, since this is my first time making a D&D character. Although the rules and such seemed a lot more similar to Saga than I was expecting. Don't ask me why. Also, ignore my rambling. I get like this when I'm tired. And on that note, to bed with me! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-27 16:06:44)

The math looks ok, just skimming over it. I throw all the characters in the character builder just to make sure.
The only issue I have with these character is slight. Keep in mind that Whitevale is completely shut off from the rest of the world. There are no other cities you know of or anything. Life, honestly, is fairly bland. If you aren't a farmer, you probably work for the city, and that probably means guard duty at some point. zenkatarn, the elven community in Whitevale is tight-knit and is actually comprised of both eladrin and elves (they're really the same race--think of the difference between high elves and wood elves from other settings). You've probably had a few other people teach you how to *fey step*. However, as you graduated from the School, training to be a wizard, your parents decided it was time to tell you that you're practically adopted; they found you in the wilderness as young child and, naturally unable to leave you to be eaten by monsters, took you in.
Sketchpad, yours sounds ok, but keep in mind the only real source of adventure and riches is to work for the city militia. There are few organized bands which do some deep exploration in the wilderness that are fairly profitable. The protector-general of the town (the head of the militia, and as close as Whitevale has to a central leader) will pardon you for the petty crimes you committed in your youth if you want to sign up. Free room and board, good pay, with only some boring guard duties and chores.
Alright, we have a full party, so I'm going to start writing up the basic intro threads tonight or tomorrow (hopefully).

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-27 16:39:09)

IÂ´m not very familiar with the math behind D&D4th so IÂ´ll not look into that, but I think I have a few points on zenÂ´s character. I might be missing things though and think stuff are wrong that isnÂ´t.
@Zen

* You should have 2 AP
* ShouldnÂ´t you only have 5 trained skills? Arcana+Eladring skill+3 more
* Fey Step is an At-Will power
* Where do you list what spells you have prepared? As I understands wizards, you canÂ´t have all your spells prepared at once.
* I think you have two Daily spells too much. I think itÂ´s meant to only allow you to add Utility spells on level 2.

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-27 16:46:31)

1) How do I have 2 AP? You start with 1 AP after rest, and only gain more for milestones. Do you get 2 at level 2 or something?
2) I listed History to note my race bonus to it. It's not trained.
3) Yes, it is. Which is how I've listed it. ...What's the problem?
4) I was assuming I was supposed to say what spells I prepared at the start of each day or something. You know, like in character. Am I wrong?
5) The way I read it, Wizards get two daily spells every time other classes normally get one. The third is from the Expanded Spellbook feat. Am I wrong on that?
Sorry, my understanding of D&D is minimal. Can has help please? ^^'

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-27 16:54:19)

1) Like I said, I probably donÂ´t know more about D&D 4th than you, but I was under the impression that you got 1 each level at least. But it seems you donÂ´t so donÂ´t mind that.
2) OK
3) Sorry, my bad. I meant to say that itÂ´s an *Encounter* power.
4) No, I guess I just figured it might be something that was nice to have on the sheet, but never mind.
5) I think you gain only 1 at 1st level, at least the examples on pg 157 only has one. But yeah, now IÂ´ve looked up what the feat does as well.

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-04-27 17:01:50)

3) Ah, ok. Sorry, misread that.
4) Well, whichever. Having never played D&D before, I'm not clear on how some stuff works, so... ^^'
5) Excerpt from the section on ritual books: "You begin knowing two daily spells, one of which you can use on any given day. Each time you gain a level that lets you select a daily spell or a utility spell, choose two different daily spells or utility spells of that level to add to your book. After an extended rest, you can prepare a number of daily and utility spells according to what you can cast per day for your level. You canâ€™t prepare the same spell twice." That's what I read that made me think two. Clarifications, anyone? ^^'

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-27 17:19:39)

Yeah, Wizards are cool like that. Most classes just get 1 daily spell, but wizards get to choose two (in their spellbook), and pick which one they actually keep for the day. Just like preparing spells in 3.5. I think Expanded Spellbook lets you get to add another daily spell in your book too.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-27 17:42:33)

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-27 18:56:14)

Samm joined the priesthood on the day he was considered an adult. He had no real talent for fighting and so his father pushed him towards the church instead. During his training in Whitevale, he received notice that his family's town had been wiped out by a necromancer and his army of the undead. This spurred Samm to study more and more, especially abilities that dealt with defeating the undead. He intended to one day find that necromancer, and send him to Pelor for his crimes, and in the process end the reign of terror of undead armies roaming the land.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-27 21:11:56)

Seems cool, but once again, there is no other village but Whitevale you know of, so there really isn't your "family's town."
Instead how about this: Samm's dad was a veteran in the militia and has seen a lot of action in his time. He doesn't want the same dogged lifestyle for his son, so he pushes Samm to join the Church, which is sort of a temple that reveres all of the good gods. Samm obeys and takes Pelor as his patron. Right when Samm was due to graduate to true priesthood, his father was sent on a mission, telling his son it was to take down a strange necromancy cult that had arisen in the south. Soon afterward, Samm hears about his father's death and vows to devote his life to destroying undead, even if it means joining the militia his father was so jaded against.
