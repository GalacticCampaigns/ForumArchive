# Fighting defensivly and skill training

### **Frost** (2008-05-29 11:27:54)

wanted to know what you guys thought of how fighting defensivly works in saga edition.
according to Rodney at WoTC it works like this
1) You use Fight Defensively as a standard action. You are now considered to be fighting defensively. This consumes your entire standard action.
2) If you choose to go "total defense" you get a bigger bonus but can make NO attacks, under any circumstances, until your next turn.
3) If you choose to just take the normal Fight Defensively action, you take the attack penalty on any attacks you make, including attacks of opportunity or attacks granted to you not on your turn (such as the result of the Impel Ally II crime lord talent). Also, don't forget that Trust (the noble talent) can give you an extra standard action, and if you are already fighting defensively it would apply to attacks made with that extra standard action.
My next question for my fellow GMs is should skill training feat only be allowed for class skills or should players be allowed to take any skill since they are using a feat to get it

I think thatÂ´s a good way to use FD. And Melee Defense takes care of giving you higher defense while still being on the offensive.
I think Skill Training should only work with class skills, since thereÂ´s absolutely nothing wrong with multiclassing to get a new skill on your list.

Ditto. I don't think there's anything wrong with the way either currently work.

I don't think one should be forced to multiclass just to get a skill.
Since, you can get Skill Training and Skill Focus for all classes, I think, that feat should be limited to class skills. Also, the class for a particular level should still limit the skills availiable for Skill Training, even if multiclassed. For example, a soldier1/scout1 achieves 3rd level and going to take Skill Training, as his bonus feat. If he takes second level in soldier, the Skill Training feat should apply only to soldier class skills. It he takes second level in scout, the feat only applies to scout class skills.
But, there should be another feat to gain Class skills outside of any of your classes. By making it a separate feat. Since, this feat is not on any class list, you would need to take it at 1st, 3rd, 6th, etc.
**External Skill Training** feat - same as skill training, but, non-class skills can be picked.

While I see and agree with your point, I canÂ´t really see peoples problem with multiclassing. The system is made to be multiclass friendly, it encourages it (while all the iconic jedi donÂ´t uses this is beyond my understanding). In most cases, even if its just a skill that you want that fits your character concept, you can easily get things to even more emphasize the concept.
Example: You have a character with only levels in Soldier. You feel he is more of a commando guy, and thinks Stealth would be a nice skill. I see nothing wrong at all with adding a level of Scoundrel/Scout (although Scout is more appropriate to me). If you do this, not only do you gain Stealth as a class skill, you also gains a bonus feat, as well as a talent. In this example, Improved Stealth or Dastardly Strike would probably fit nice in, depending on concept.

Skill Training
Benefit: You gain training in one skill. The skill
need not be on your class skill list.
Special: You can take this feat more than once.
Each time you select this feat, choose a skill in which
you are not trained.
This is how 4E is working skill training but the do not get bonus feats like saga characters. You do get a feat every even level though

As well as the issue of feats, there's also this:
While Saga is extremely multiclass friendly, 4e is extremely multiclass *restrictive*. More than that, actually: Whatever wizards might say about the matter, the truth is that you actually can't multiclass anymore. Once you've picked your class you're stuck in it for the whole career, because spending feat slots to take a few ability dips into the ability lists of one (and *only* one - though you do get similar options from paragon paths and epic destinies) other class is *not* the same thing.
At this point, please note I'm not casting a judgment on the new D&D approach, merely making a commentary. Personally, I think it'll probably end up being a good thing because I never did like the clunky prestige class method of power accrual.
What it does mean, though, is there's no mechanical way of getting a skill not on your original list unless they allow it with the Skill Training feat. In Saga, on the other hand, you can pick up multiple new class skills at once when multiclassing, and usually significant other mechanical benefits besides.
Making (in my opinion) the proposed change to Skill Training unnecessary at a practical level. Will it break the game? Probably not, if you take Saracia's advice and only allow the extra flexibility on the level-based feat slots. Probably and emphatically yes if you allow it any time Skill Training could otherwise be taken.

Don't know if it's listed in the book, but generally, bonuses from the same action/power/maneuver do not stack. Ya know, like two walls don't grant double cover.
But that's just my take.
> *&#8230;bunch of stuff talking about multi-classing and D&amp;D 4th&#8230;*

*<span style="font-size: 0.85em;">I was going to directly quote, but&#8230;it&#39;s not like I gotta point out where I disagree&#8230;</span>*
I agree with Scribe here. D&D 4th is closer to Ad&D in the area of multiclassing- meaning it won't happen often. The characters are more defined by their class than ever before. Before, you had a concept, and fiddled with the classes until it worked. Now, you take the class and try craft a concept off of it. Not as...free as 3.5.
It looks fast, however. Quick to start, easy to run.

I think fighting defensively, and total defense works fine.
On the topic of Skill Training
There is another option to gain a skill that is not normally in your class, well its more of tailoring the adventure that influences skills granted to players.
RPGA has some rewards for points in there sanctioned games, one of them was a background card called Clone Wars Veteran. It basically granted some abilities to the character that had this background. One of the granted abilities was that Stealth was now a class skill.
I don't think its unbalancing to give a character access to a skill that would not normally be in his class along as there is a good reason for it, and the GM is granting the skill.
In game I may have a mentor/teacher train someone in a skill that is out of class.
This would be the only way I would give characters a non-class skill. Skills really help define the classes. I think a lot of people would like to take Treat Injury, but hey.. You can't have it all <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->)
