# Move Object an Area Attack

### **Anonymous** (2007-09-29 17:12:04)

What do you guys think about letting players and npcs alike use the Move Object to attack an area as long as the object or objects being lifted make the DC for Large or greater. I would say a large object would damage an area 2 x 2. I suppose as long as you can lift the object it could damage the same area that would be its fighting space.
Also, if a player or npc uses the Move Object to pick up multiple medium objects weighing as much as a large object would you say that it deals large object damage or medium object damage.
I have come to realize that taking a 10 is very common, and it get tricky when the skill Use the Force is being used by taking a 10.
As a GM do you let your players take a 10 on Mind Trick Suggestions?
Also in this scenario,
The players and Npcs have rolled initiative and are engaged in combat. Its a melee vs melee combat, no long ranged weapons except a force powers. Not technically threated as the term is used in game mechanics. One of my players decides to force slam his incoming opponents and asks to take a 10.
Initially I am thinking to myself he is threatened and in combat, Initiative has already been rolled so he would be consider distracted or threatened. For the sake of keeping everything moving I let him Use the Force by take a 10 for Force Slam.
But how would you as a GM handle this, and for that matter taking a 10 in combat, but not technically threatened as described in game terms.
Thanks in advanced for any input

<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">For the Area Attack idea:
I generally play a little loose with the rules when it comes to&quot;magic&quot; and the Force, so this isn&#39;t a bad idea for me. However, because it&#39;s an area attack, half damage to everyone attacked might seem a bit stiff- especially at lower levels, where the Use Force check can be much higher than any attack bonus. So, in this case, I would assign a -5 to the skill check. Call it a circumstance penalty due to the cumbersome weapon the Force User is swinging.
This is the same penalty that auto-fire rules use, so it should work well enough.
Mass vs Size:
The way I figure it, the exact weight and size does matter when you use object. What ever TK strength you don&#39;t use to lift the object you use to make said object go faster. Half the speed and double the weight, or double the speed, and half the weight, it&#39;s still going to hurt about the same (the math way off, but you get the point).
Taking !0 for Mind Trick
Hell no.
I&#39;ll elaborate: Your Force User is screwing with some one&#39;s brain. He is, in effect, playing mind games with the subject. Any one who has been dating knows that these can backfire, or go the wrong way. Hence, some one needs to roll some dice.
Taking 10 for other Use the Force stuff
Per the rules, you can&#39;t take ten in a stressful situation. Combat is always stressful. Sure, that particular second, he was free from ranged combat, but he had folks charging him. I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but if you have four brutes running full tilt at me, I&#39;m not thinking I could take a nap.
But, I don&#39;t fault you for keeping the game going.</span>

for taking 10 on Use the Force: ThatÂ´s what the Force Technique "Force Power Mastery" is for. You still canÂ´t do it with the basic skill applications though (Sense Surroundings, MLO, etc)

Under Use the Force it says you can take a 10 for this skill if you are not distracted or threatened.
I was unclear when this taking of a 10 should be allowed. You can't be distracted, or in combat to take a 10, or threatened in any way.
I wasn't sure if he would be considered distracted, in combat, or threatened at the time. Now I realize, once initiative was rolled it was combat and the distraction of combat should have prevented him from taking a 10.
Yes you are right though, if he wanted to take a 10 in combat he would have needed Force Power Mastery (Force Slam).
