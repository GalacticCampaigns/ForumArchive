# House Rule Depository

### **Anazider** (2008-01-22 14:36:36)

Figured this would be a nice place to put any house rules anyone comes up with, in case other GMs would like ideas. Here's one I use for dealing with hangars when designing/modifying ships using the rules in SotG:
â€¢ Hangers now cost 5 EP, and concealed hangers cost 20 EP.
â€¢ Ships take up a number of units worth of hanger space equal to their cost modifier.
â€¢ Ships can hold a number of units worth of ships in their hanger equal to their cost modifier/10.
â€¢ Ships can release a number of units worth of ships per round equal to their cost modifier/25.
â€¢ Ships can increase the number of ships they can release per round by a number equal to their cost modifier/25 for 5 EP, or 20 EP from a concealed hanger.

Speaking of House rules I was thinking about deflecting an adjacent attacking enemy.
The rule was to tone down Jedi deflect. I'm not saying it needs to be, but here is my idea.
A character can not use the talent Deflect against an adjacent attacking enemy with a ranged weapon.
Or maybe Deflecting a ranged attack against an adjacent enemy would cause a -5 penalty to your Use The Force check.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Talents</span>
[ul][*]**Noble:**  
[ul][*]***Ignite Fervor:*** Replace the final sentence with the followingâ€”"Once their fervour has been ignited, the affected ally doesnâ€™t need to remain in line of sight of you. If their next attack misses, or if the encounter ends before they attempt an attack, they lose the bonus to damage granted by this talent."  
[*]***Adept Negotiator:*** Add the following before the final paragraphâ€”"If the target is attacked by you or one of your allies, it moves +1 step along the condition track on its next turn and can attack you or your allies again if it had been prevented from doing so. It continues to move +1 step along the condition track on all subsequent turns until it is recovered, although it can only recover condition loss from Adept Negotiator and other mind-affecting abilities in this manner. You (or an ally with the Adept Negotiator talent) can attempt to use Adept Negotiator on the target again; succeeding halts this recovery process as well as affecting the target normally.  
You can attempt to use Adept Negotiator to help a target who is already under the effect of Adept Negotiator (or another similar mind-affecting effect) recover. You must equal or exceed their Will Defense, and take a penalty to your Persuasion roll equal to their current condition track penalty. They also gains a +5 bonus to their Will Defense if they are higher level than you. If you succeed, the target moves +1 step along the condition track. You can only help an ally recover condition loss from Adept Negotiator and other mind-affecting abilities in this manner."
[*]***Master Negotiator:*** Add the following before the final paragraphâ€”"If you successfully use the Adept Negotiator talent to help a target recover, they move an additional +1 step along the condition track (+2 steps total), although they cannot recover condition loss from anything other than Adept Negotiator and other mind-affecting abilities in this manner."[/ul]  
**Jedi:**
[ul][*]***Block/Deflect:*** No change, but see *Reactions*. Now all reactions that require a skill check take the cumulative -5 penalties for using other reactions since your last turn. Block and Deflect, while still useful, are no longer such an obvious and powerful means of defense, since using them prevents you from using other reactions so well.  
[*]***Redirect Shot:*** Replace the last sentence of the final paragraph with the followingâ€”"Barrages from autofire weapons and other types of projectiles canâ€™t **normally** be redirected." Add the following after the final paragraphâ€”"You may opt to redirect a single blaster bolt out of an autofire barrage you have deflected, but in order to do so you willingly put yourself in the path of fire, and as such you automatically take full damage from the autofire attack provided the attack roll is higher than 10. If you have the Evasion talent, you only take half damage unless the attack also beats your Reflex Defense. Additionally, you take a -5 penalty to your attack roll when redirecting the shot."  
[*]***Lightsaber Defense:*** Replace the text with the followingâ€”"As a swift action, you can use your lightsaber to parry your opponent's attacks, gaining a +2 deflection bonus to your Reflex Defense until the start of your next turn. You must have a lightsaber drawn and ignited to use this talent, and you don't gain the deflection bonus if you are flat-footed or otherwise unaware of the incoming attack.  
You can take this talent a second time; the deflection bonus increases by +2. You can also increase the deflection bonus by +1 by taking the Makashi or Soresu Lightsaber Form talents, to a maximum of +6."[/ul]
**Jedi Knight:**
[ul][*]***Makashi:*** Replace the text with the followingâ€”"The deflection bonus you gain from the Lightsaber Defense talent increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6). Additionally, you may reroll a failed Deception check to feint in combat, but you must take the result even if it is worse."  
[*]***Soresu:*** Replace the text with the followingâ€”"The deflection bonus you gain from the Lightsaber Defense talent increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6). Additionally, you may reroll a failed Use the Force check when using the Block or Deflect talents, but you must take the result even if it is worse. [/ul][/ul]  
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Skills</span>
[ul][*]**Initiative:**[ul]  
[*]***Limited Evasion:*** Once per round as a reaction, you can make an Initiative check against a DC equal to the result of an area attack made against you (including force powers - see below). If you succeed, you gain a limited evasion against that attack. The damage dealt by the attack is halved (so if it beat your Reflex defense it now deals half damage, and if it failed to beat your Reflex defense it now deals one-quarter damage). You take a cumulative -5 penalty on your Initiative check for every time you have used another reaction such as Block or Deflect since the beginning of your last turn. Likewise, using Limited Evasion incurs a -5 penalty on your checks to use other reactions.[/ul][/ul]  
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Feats</span>
[ul][*]**Dodge:** Now functions like *Vehicular Combat*. Replace the prerequisites with "Trained in the Initiative skill". Replace the benefit with "Once per round (as a reaction) when you are on foot, you may negate an attack by making a successful Initiative check. The DC of the skill check is equal to the result of the attack roll you wish to negate. You take a cumulative -5 penalty on your Initiative check for every time you have used another reaction such as Block or Deflect since the beginning of your last turn. Likewise, using Dodge incurs a -5 penalty on your checks to use other reactions."  
[*]**Vehicular Combat:** Add the following to the benefit: "You take a cumulative -5 penalty on your Pilot check for every time you have used another reaction such as Block or Deflect since the beginning of your last turn. Likewise, using Vehicular Combat incurs a -5 penalty on your checks to use other reactions."[/ul]  
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Force Powers</span>
[ul][*]*Sever Force* is banned. No way are you allowed to take away my main villain's force points and leave him crippled. It sucks the challenge and fun right out of the campaign's supposedly epic finale. If this power is to be used in my games at all, it will serve the story, not derail it.  
[*]The following force powers are now considered area attacks: *Force Lightning*, *Force Slam*, *Move Object* (When used to attack with large or bigger objects). Therefore, if the check result when using these powers is less than 10, the force power deals no damage at all; also, the Evasion talent applies against them.  
[*]*Mind Trick* does not cause a target to flee for a minute unconditionally. 10 combat rounds is a really long time to take a PC (or, for that matter, a villain) out of the combat, particularly if it also moves them 10 rounds AWAY from the combat (effectively requiring another 10 rounds to get back). The target now flees for two rounds. Each subsequent round, reduce the Use the Force check result by five and compare it to the target's Will defense again to see if they continue fleeing.[/ul]  
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Types of Actions</span>
[ul][*]**Reactions:** All reactions that require a skill check take the cumulative -5 penalties for using other reactions since your last turn. See *Block*, *Deflect*, *Dodge*, *Vehicular Combat*, and *Initiative [Limited Evasion]* for examples.[/ul]  
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Vehicles</span>
[ul][*]**Squadrons:** See viewtopic.php?f=6&t=246.[/ul]

[ul]
[*]Block/Deflect can be used against a critical to take normal damge. The Use the Force check must meet or beat the total attack roll.  
[*]When using Force powers which requires a standard action or full-round action in combat; allies of the target, if adjacent, may make an Attack of Opportunity against the Force user if one has not been take already by the ally that round. The target, however, may not make an Attack of Oppurtunity against the Force user.  
Example: If Jedi Knight Juda Lurn attemted to use Force Grip on a Captain of the Guard (who is 4 squares away) while Juda was flanked by two of the guards, both guards would get an AoO on the Jedi. However, if Juda attempted to Force Grip one of the two guards, the other guard would get an AoO, but the victim of the Force Grip would not.
[*]Force Points may be used to Atone, however the character must have taken steps in the game to atone for the action which caused the Dark Side Point.  
[*]Character's who gain Dark Side points equal to 1/2 their wisdom score instantly become the property of the GM. (When playing a lightside/ heroes campaign)[/ul]

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-02-08 14:50:32)

[ul]
[*]Power of the Darkside is no longer a talent, but an option allowed for all Force-users  
[*]Combat Gloves is not a weapon, just a piece of equipment that adds to you unarmed damage. All specific feats are taken for unarmed attacks, wich is treated as a light weapon that can be dual-wielded, even if you are holding a double weapon, wich will then allow for one attack with the weapon and one unarmed attack.  
[*]If an unarmed attack bets the targets DT, the attacker may choose to apply the effects of the Bantha Rush feat instead of pushing him down the CT.  
[*]The "fear" aspect of *Mind Trick* donÂ´t cause the target to flee in terror. It rather fills him with fear and doubt, causing him to take a -1 penalty to attack rolls and skill checks, -1 more for every 5 points you beats his Will Defense with. This lasts for one minute, but can be negated by increaseing your DSS by 1. A Force Point can be spent to double the duration. [/ul]  
This list will probably increase, and will be used in conjunction with [**my custom material**](http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=78 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=78")

Lightsaber duels have been adjusted a bit to match the movies. Damage done by a lightsaber does not "physically" hurt until an attack reduces you to 0 hp. Once you hit 0 hp, the person attacking has the option for a "Finishing blow". A finishing blow represents that you are too tired to defend yourself anymore against a lightsaber attack, the winning duelist can then select which body part they are attacking, and either dismember you or kill you. I like this rule because it allows for the true power of a lightsaber and makes duels more suspenseful.
An example of my rule would be Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon had taken damage in hp although he wasn't getting struck, he was getting slowed down and was getting less and less effective against Maul's repeated strikes. Qui-Gon was reduced to 0 hp the moment Darth Maul pushed his lightsaber handle into Qui-Gon to parry. Maul then has a free action to strike him anywhere he likes, and he chose to kill him.

All you've really done there is give everyone with a lightsaber the Jedi Knight talent *Severing Strike*.

### **Dreamwalker** (2008-03-04 17:32:08)

Yes, but only if they are proficient with lightsabers. Severing Strike is as easy at swinging at someone's limb when they are unable to defend themselves, it shouldn't be a talent. Simply because you are skilled enough to kill them it should be no different as to swinging at his hand.

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-06 07:15:56)

**Skill Training:** When taking the Skill Training feat, you may select any skill to become trained in, even those that are not on your class skills list for any of your classes. You may not select the Use the Force skill unless you also have the Force Sensitivity feat.
**Multiclassing:** When adding your first level of a new class, you may elect to give up your selection of a bonus feat from that class' starting feats list. If you do so, you instead become trained in one of the class skills for that class. You may not select the Use the Force skill unless you also have the Force Sensitivity feat.

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-07 07:10:07)

**Force Sensitivity:** I was talking with a guy that plays the game last night as well, and he suggests that it might be a good idea to have Force Sensitivity give you training in Use the Force as well, since the feat does nothing (really) other than allow you to take Skill Training in Use the Force.

It allows you to select Force talents. It also allows you to use Use the Force untrained (which includes Search Your Feelings, Sense Surroundings, and Telepathy). I fail to see how this is "nothing".
Also, I'm not one to claim force users are broken, but they *are* quite powerful enough without giving them another feat to play with. That Skill Training they no longer have to buy could, for example, allow them to purchase them an additional Force Training feat.

Many of the force talents require you to have UtF, or are otherwise nearly useless without it. Some even require you to have specific powers. "Visions" requires you to have Farseeing, and the talents in the Alter tree are all but useless without UtF and at least one of the telekinetic powers. The powers that come with Force Sensitivity are also nearly useless without UtF.
I'm not saying this variant is right or anything, I'm just putting the idea out there. But it seems to me that spending 1 feat to aquire Force Sensitivity, then needing to spend yet another feat to be able to use a few skeevy little powers decently, then spending yet ANOTHER feat (or two, or three....) to aquire a few tricks that can only be used once per encounter under most circumstances makes force users a very harsh thing to play.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-03-08 15:19:46)

Guess what? Breeder no likes it. Considering Move Object and Force Choke are considered "I Win" buttons anyhow, I say any character who wants one *needs* to take two feats before they get them.
Outside of my prejudice against the super heroes of the Star Wars universe, I agree with
**simplyscribed** that Search Your Feelings, Sense Surroundings, and Telepathy are cool powers, all by themselves. I'd use a feat for those. Hell, look at *Dodge*. Force Sensitive (and every other feat, really) is better than Dodge. Being able to 'see' in total darkness is better than Weapon Focus.
That's how I think of it, anyhow.

Right on the money. Granted, if you look at the mechanics of it the feat doesn't seem to offer much. But if you look instead at the options the feat opens up for you - character-wise, action-wise, roleplay-wise - it's a motherlode of potential.

True enough I s'pose. Not a houserule I would use tho, and I was only defending it because I was the one who proposed it, and I had to mount at least a token defense to say I did try to defend it. =]--

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Retraining:**</span>
Sometimes you make decisions when you create or advance your character that you later regret. Perhaps a talent you chose isn't working with your character concept, or a feat never comes into play the way you anticipated.
Every time you gain a level, you can retrain your character: change one feat, talent, or skill selection you made previously. You can make only one change at each level.
**Feat:**You can replace a feat with another feat. You must meet the prerequisites of the new feat. You canâ€™t replace a feat if itâ€™s a prerequisite for any other attribute you have. If you choose to replace a feat you gained as a class bonus, you must replace it with a feat from the bonus feat list for that class.
**Talent:** You can replace a talent with another talent from the same class. You must meet any prerequisites for that talent and you can't replace the talent of it is a prerequisite for another attribute.
**Skill:** You can replace a trained skill with another trained skill from your class list. You canâ€™t replace a skill if itâ€™s required for any other attribute you have.
I also added that characters needed to be level 3 or higher to retrain. Reason being, I wanted players to have a feel for how their characters work with the others and have a goal in mind for what they would like their character's to do.

### **Anonymous** (2008-06-10 08:58:22)

That's interesting Alica, I usually let player re-arrange there character til 4th level. Then they can't change anything unless a new book comes out. Sort of the reverse of what you do, but it works too.
