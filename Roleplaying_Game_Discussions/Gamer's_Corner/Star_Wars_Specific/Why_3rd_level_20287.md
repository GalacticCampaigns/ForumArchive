# Why 3rd level

### **galenbd** (2008-10-28 17:00:08)

Hello,
I been looking at the games being run and they all seem to be starting at 3rd level not 1st. With triple hitpoints, SAGA is much easier on 1st level characters than, say, D&D 3.5. Why not start at 1st level?

I think the answer is very simple: You have more ability to customize your character, use stats to flesh out a character concept, and just generally...more.

I don't like starting at 1st level because it's just so limiting to me. that and how long play by post games take, getting from 1st to 10th level can take years.

I would like to think that the starting level of players in a game is dictated by the story involved. It is true a few levels gives one more options, but more importantly it gives characters a little more story as well. What was that character doing from 1st to 3rd level, this is above and beyond the normal background that anyone can make for a 1st level character. Well that's my two cents for now, there are always more reasons I am sure others will have more to say.

Starting at 1st level isn't only limiting to the player, its limiting to the GM. Remember starting at first lvl in DnD? 'Let's see, hmm *flips through MM* I can do two Orcs, of four Goblins, or hey look at this! Eight Rats! My players are gonna sweat that one!
The higher the leel, the more that they can mechanically handle.

I once heard the description of a first level AD&D II party describe as this:
The fighter makes his way through the dungeon. He comes to a door he can't knock down, so he pulls out his lockpick set- the thief- and holds it close to the door. After the door is unlocked, he stuffs the rogue back into his pocket. He goes through the door, and encounters some orcs. After dispatching them, he pulls out his 1/day med kit- the cleric- and applies the healing. After that, the cleric gets put away, and fighter continues on. After a short while, he stumbles into a group of goblins. Then the fighter unslings his 1/day magic wand- the wizard- fires off a sleep spell, and then kills unconscious goblins. The wizard, having served his purpose that day, gets stuffed back into the fighter's backpack.

I love it, so true.
The direction 4thEdD&D has taken shows this idea built-in. 1st level characters there are the equivalent of, what, 4th level of another previous gen system? even 3.5? A level 1 3.5 anything vs level 1 anything 4th is dead practically before the fight starts. : *splat*

And this is why most GM's start games at 3rd lvl instead of 1st: It's a holdover from previous versions of the game.

I remember playing in a RCR game that started us out at 12th. Was basically a Wraith Squadron type game. Great game a long time ago.

I remeber looking at 3.0 D&D when it came out looking at the MM. The Orc staright out of the box could pretty much kill a frist level anything with pretty much one blow. They put them in there with a great axe and like a 18 or 17 str. This could do alot of damage right off the bat. I like playing at frist level it makes character development easier because they are brand new there frist adventure. But I under the need for the character to be higher level to make the GMs job easier and it is nice to have the extra hit points and the higherr defence and Attack.

With many already placing a voice on why 3rd level I felt it custom to put my vote in the hat as well. I generally choose the start players out with a little edge of the game. If you think about playing that first level you just sneeze through it and now take time to level up your characters taking time away from the game to do so. With allowing my players to hit 3rd off the bat I ask for a decent back story and also it allows them to start seeing where they wish to take their character creation wise. PLanning ahead saves time espically in a pbp system.

One reason I like to start characters higher then level one, is then its easier to see where a character will go in the long run. Especially in 3.5, by level three its clear what prestige class a player is intending to take, so you can plot more effectively, and include elements that will challenge said character.
Another reason, is players get bored if every time you start a game, they always start with a level one character, that they may or may not see reach their full potential. For that reason alone, one of the people I played with will run a one-shot that starts us at Level 20.

I usually start at Level 1 in my SW games. But I also ask for how the player got to that level, as I feel a 1st level character w/ a heroic class is just taking the first steps on becoming a hero <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> Personally, I'd like to see WotC bring out Backgrounds for characters much like they've done for 4th ed D&D (and that Paizo's been doing for a while now).
