# Jedi Gunslinger

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-11 15:03:17)

I posted this question on d20 radio's forums, but would like more input.
Hey there, folks. I am need of some help. Years ago, I came across an old WEG d6 Star Wars game supplement called the Jedi Handbook. You can find it at this website still. [http://www.rpg-domain.de/JHV13/index2.htm](http://www.rpg-domain.de/JHV13/index2.htm "http://www.rpg-domain.de/JHV13/index2.htm")
Point is, I have a friend who heard me mentioning some of the Jedi there-in and became interested (the man practically drooled) in the Teepo Paladins. He wanted me to build a way for him to play the blaster wielding Jedi in my on home-brew game, and I was interested in seeing this bad dude in action. So, I built a talent tree for it. However, given that I don't want to unbalance the game, I come before you, the great ones of Star Wars knowledge, to ask for you opinions. Here is the tree, let me know if it works or not. Does it need less goodies? More penalties? Let me know, thanks. If this tree build is successful, I plan on building the Monks of Shimura next. I just love the idea of Jedi Kung Fu goodness!
> **Teepo Paladin**
> A relatively new sect within the Jedi Order, the Paladins were founded by a Twiâ€™lek Jedi Master named Nars Teepo. Nars Teepo had an odd view on Jedi life for a Jedi Master. He believed in change. Teepo felt that the Jedi should keep up with change. Just as the Jedi had left behind their bare hands for steel sabers, and those for lightsabers, so too should they leave the lightsaber behind for the blaster pistol. He began to study the way of the pistol and to apply his knowledge of the Force to his pistol use.
> Nars Teepo was shunned by the other masters of the Order for his views and even considered by his old friends to have fallen to the Dark Side. This rejection hit him hard and he took on the life of a hermit. The Order sent several masters and sentinels to help bring Teepo back, but they each found no trace of the Dark Side in him. Many even became his disciples. Thus began the small Order of the Paladins. They have also been called the Teepo Paladins, in honor of their founder. One other name they are called is the Quick Draw Jedi.
> Paladins lead a solitary life, drifting from place to place, helping out where they are needed. Whenever a paladin finds a force sensitive being who is willing, he takes them on as his apprentice and teaches them the way of the pistol. Paladins have a slightly stronger view on the Dark Side than the knights do. While it is true that knights shun the Dark Side and its temptations, paladins have been known to allow themselves to be killed without moving a muscle, for fear that they might kill in anger. This view of the Dark Side has prevented any paladins from falling to the Dark Side. And, should a paladin fall to the Dark Side, other paladins would be summoned on a crusade to hunt that paladin down and either bring him back or kill him (hint to GMs).
> Like knights, paladins do not wear any armor, with the exception of a blast helmet. When wearing their blast helmet, paladins keep the shield down. This is to show their faith in the Force in guiding them in combat. Paladins have actually developed a technique that gives them the ability to see clearly in the Force, even when blinded by their blast helmets, or caught in the dark. This ability has helped them greatly in many fights. This ability is also seen only in the true masters of the Way of the Pistol.
> The Teepo Paladins have additional tenets to the code they follow:
> 1. Never draw without being drawn upon first.
> 2. Aggression leads to the Dark Side. Never consort with it for any reason. Be at constant piece at all times. (GMs who allow this talent tree should award DSPs for even little acts of aggression. Paladins make no exceptions and follow a very strict path.)
> 3. Never use a lightsaber. Nars Teepo made this a tenet after being shunned by the Order.
> 4. Never use a heavy blaster pistol or anything larger. Such weapons are only meant for aggressive beings. Never hide your pistol. It is a sign of who you are. Additionally, it is dishonorable to hide a weapon, as that is only done to catch someone unawares with a sneak attack. A paladin would never do this.
> **Teepo Paladin Talent Tree**
> Â· **Force Sight** â€“ Same as the Miralukan Species Trait. Teepo Paladins train themselves to see through the Force by wearing blindfolds or blast helmets with the shield down. They can â€œseeâ€ by using the Force. They can ignore the effect of darkness as if they had darkvision. However, this does not allow Teepo Paladins to detect creatures that are invisible to the Force, such as Yuzzhan Vong or ysalmari through the Force. Additionally, the Teepo Paladins ignore all penalties to Perception checks from cover and concealment (but not total cover or total concealment.) As a swift action, make a DC 20 Use the Force check to activate this talent. This talent may be maintained as a free action each round by continuing to make the Use the Force check DC 20. *Prerequisite:* Trained and Focused in Use the Force, Force Perception Talent
> Â· **Way of the Pistol 1** â€“ A blaster pistol is a dangerous weapon, more so in the hands of a Teepo Paladin. A Paladin has trained himself in the way of the pistol to such an extent that they can cause more damage with it. A blaster pistol used by a Paladin with this talent increases itâ€™s damage die by one die step; d4 to d6, d6 to d8, etc. Also since the Paladins are unable to block lightsaber strikes or deflect blaster bolts, their training in the way of the pistol makes them very difficult to hit. A Paladin with this talent also receives a +1 bonus to his Reflex Defense. *Prerequisites:* Weapon Focus (pistols), Weapon Specialization (pistols)
> o **Way of the Pistol 2** â€“ Same as Way of the Pistol 1, but with another die step of damage die and another +1 bonus to Reflex Defense that stacks with the first. *Prerequisites:* Weapon Focus (pistols), Weapon Specialization (pistols), Way of the Pistol 1
> Â§ **Way of the Pistol 3** â€“ Same as Way of the Pistol 1 &amp; 2, but with again another step of damage die and another +1 bonus to Reflex Defense that stacks with the first and second. *Prerequisites:* Weapon Focus (pistols), Weapon Specialization (pistols), Way of the Pistol 1, Way of the Pistol 2
> Â· **Summon Pistols** â€“ A Teepo Paladin can summon his pistols to his hands much the same way a Jedi can his lightsaber, even if the pistol is not a light object. However, a Paladin who dual wields pistols can summon both in the same move action. The DC for one pistol is 10. For both pistols at the same time, the DC is 20.
> Â· **Dual Pistol Mastery** â€“ A Paladin using this talent can spend a Force point to make a full attack with pistols as a standard action. This only works while the paladin wields pistols. No other weapon works with this.

Hmm, hard to say really. While I have no particular feelings on the subject of an all-blaster using Force Tradition, I do think most of the talents are either quite broken or quite useless.
**Force Sight** - I think this talent has way too much prerequistites to make it useful, and accidentially I think its prerequistites makes it worthless. It works as a species trait for Miraluka and is cool for them, but if I already have Skill Focus(Use the Force) and Force Perception, why would I ever want to use this talent? I can already make very high Perception checks, and shouldnÂ´t be too worried about failing any Sense Surroundings checks, even if I raise it to 20 to ignore total cover.
**Way of the Pistol I-III** - Basically Martial Arts, but for pistols. Difference is, pistols already has a good base damage. Very overpowered, especially for a "fallen" Paladin, who donÂ´t care about restricting himself to "non-Heavy" pistols. BlasTech DT-12 + WotP III = 4d12+2 damage. Quite broken for a pistol if you ask me. Also, I canÂ´t see any reason the defense bonus should be there, not in the same way I can see it for Martial Arts.
**Summon Pistols** - Only useful if you uses two pistols, as the majority of pistols (I havenÂ´t checked thoroughly, but I havenÂ´t found any that donÂ´t) weighs less than 5 kgs. Also lacks a range limit, you could technically summon a pistol from another planet into your hand.
**Dual Pistol Mastery** - Quite overpowered, as most other effects that allows you to make Full Attacks faster is either 1/encounter or costs a DP, or has a lot of prerequistites.
Sorry if it seems harsh, but thatÂ´s just my initial thoughts.

Don't worry about being harsh, Anthrax. I'm looking to make it a working talent tree.
I added the Ref Def bonus to help the Paladins out since they can't block or deflect with a blaster.
As to the WOTP talents, they do have a limit, being the Dark Side Points for characters. That's why I suggest GMs only allow it if they're willing to really put the DSPs on a person. I was worried about that pistol stuff, though. Also, If one started with a heavy blaster pistol, it would go 3d8-3d10-3d12-3d20 by the end of WOTP 3. Chimaera earlier made a suggestion of putting this tree in a Prestige Class. Would that make it better?
Summon pistols was intended to be cool for dual wielders, true. It's limit, which I apparently forgot to add, was the same as move light object, 6 squares.
As to Force Sight, I didn't think that Force Perception checks were quite as good as Force sight. That's why I made it with the bonuses of swift action to activate and free to maintain.
Hmmmmmm. I might have to keep working. That's why I'm asking for help.

I understand why you added the defense bonus from WotP, but I canÂ´t see a sensible reason as to why it should be there. For regular Martial Arts, it is quite natural, but what about training with a pistol naturally makes you better at defending yourself? Also, you say you add this as a compensation for them not being able to block or deflect. WhatÂ´s to say that they have to be as good in defending themselves as Jedi? Naturally, since they chose away the lightsaber, they wonÂ´t be able to use it like the Jedi do, as an excellent defensive tool.
And yeah, starting from a Heavy Blaster Pistol, you could get up to 3d20 damage, thatÂ´s the other extreme example. Its about 10 points higher average damage than a Blaster Cannon. Slap Rapid Shot on that and you deal 4d20+2+1/2 level damage with only a -1 to attack modifier if you have WotP III. As for Dark Side Points being a good restrict, I donÂ´t think so. Most people who will abuse this talent probably donÂ´t care about their Dark Side Score anyway, and you just end up limiting those who want to play a good guy from this tradition.
I suspected that Summon Pistols had a limit of 6 squares, but like I said, the only ones who have any use of it is dual wielders, and since they wonÂ´t be able to fire both pistols in the same round (unless they use your overpowered Dual Pistol Mastery) theyÂ´d be better off summoning one pistol and shooting.
The advantage I can see to using Force Sight over Force Perception + Sense Surroundings is that you donÂ´t need to make a check to ignore normal cover or concealment and that you save a Swift action. You also donÂ´t increase the DC for ignoring total cover. Could be nice of course, but I donÂ´t think I ever would find myself interested in doing it. Unless I am in a real hurry, I could just take Imp Sense Surroundings, and have close to the exact same effect.

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-11 17:49:56)

As to WOTP, what about instead of the die increases, make a bonus to attacking with the pistol? That might prevent some abuse. Again, what about putting the whole tree in a prestige class (not sure which)? That might make it harder to get a hold of and raise the levels needed first. Again, I just like this idea.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-11 18:05:38)

Well, you already have the Gunslinger PrC. If you really feel the need, add in a new talent tree, but the PrC already has good options to replace Dual Pistol Mastery. Summon Pistols donÂ´t seem quite worth it as a talent to me, and Force Sight seems like it should belong in the Luka Sense tradition or simply under the Sense talent tree as it donÂ´t have anything that related especially to this tradition.
WotP would probably do itself better as a line that donÂ´t have identical effect, something like the Blaster and Blade line for the Master Privateer. Maybe something like this:
I - Use Charisma instead of Dexterity for attack rolls with pistols
II - Add your Charisma modifier as a bonus to pistol damage rolls, gain double if aiming first
III - By spending a Force Point, you can increase the critical range of all pistol attacks before then end of your next turn by 1

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-11 18:47:22)

I like those options for WOTP. I wasnt' necessarily married to the Force Sight thing, it's just part of the Teepo tradition. Summon Pistols **did** work better for Dual Wielders. What if Dual Pistol Mastery was simply another chance for a full round attack as a standard action? Like another Accelerated Attack? Kinda like Extra Second Wind and Tough As Nails? Maybe make it so that you can take it again and again?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-04-11 19:40:42)

How come you think Force Sight should be a part of this tradition as opposed to just being a general Sense talent? Like I said, if it should belong to any tradition it should IMO be the Luka Sene. I just donÂ´t see that it has any specific tie to a sect of Force-using gunslingers except for the fact that they like to use blast helmets to blind themselves.
Summon Pistol might have had some cred for Dual Wielders, but I say it just makes more sense to have them take Imp Move light Object. Otherwise youÂ´d have to answer the question why they can only use it on pistols.
What you could have for Dual Pistol Mastery is to spend a Force Point to gain the benefit of aiming on all attacks during a Full Attack using only pistols. Could make a hell of a difference depending on your build.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-04-12 01:28:58)

Perhaps...I think it would be simpler & more accurate to the books to merely make a feat that allows the user to use lightsaber feats with pistols. The paladin in question really doesn't do anything special- outside of blocking blaster bolts- with her pistols. You can block any ranged weapon you are aware of (Force Sense and a high perception helps with that) and disallow re-directing the attacks. Maybe grant a small attack bonus (and the same bonus to shooting incoming shots), if you think the feats need some omph.
I wouldn't allow the user to block shots at nearby people unless the lightsaber feat allows it. If yer a paladin and want to keep some one from being shot, stand in front of them.
And yes, I read the stupid books. I do read Star Wars books, and I even read stupid Jedi Star Wars books. Hence, my annoyance at Swiss-army-knife Jedi. The paladin and the reporter were the most interesting characters in all three books.
Stupid Jedi.

### **Avarna** (2009-04-13 09:51:21)

Just to comment on the books.
I agree with you Breeder.
I've read enough of Michael Reeves (The author of the books in question) and I'm totally unimpressed. Every book he's written has a connection to the Medstar novels. What makes it more stupid in my mind, is he's continuing a PLOT he started in those novels though the Darth Maul book he wrote, and finally finishes it in the Courasant Night series.
I find it hard to get into his books, and any truly interesting characters are shoved to the sideline by the sterotypical cookie cutter characters.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-04-13 14:46:42)

[Wookiepedia](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Teepo_Paladins "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Teepo_Paladins") has an entry on these guys, but I did find where you got what you have.
I dunno. According to the books- or at least what I remember of them- the Grey Paladins didn't refuse to use lightsabers, merely figured the Jedi Order should have progressed with the times (ya know, like adding a *stun* setting...). But the books never went into detail, really. The character who was a Grey Paladin was a very minor character, and only around to be a romantic interest (that's why she's a twi'lik). The internal angst of main character and his ability to accept droids as people consumed way too much of the first book to allow room anyone else to have a personality.
Whoops. Did I say that out loud?

### **Anonymous** (2009-04-13 16:59:16)

Well, remember that I'm trying to build the Teepo Paladins, not the Grey Paladins. Granted, most people have a point in that maybe I should leave it to the Gunslinger PrC. However, I'm a glutton for punishment. O0 I need to remake the talents, taking Anthrax's suggestions into consideration.

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-20 20:42:58)

For now, I'm putting the Paladin tree aside. I'll pick it back up later, most likely. However, in the mean time I thought maybe building a Teepo using stuff already there.
Scoundrel, force sensitive, dual weapons 1-3, weapon focus (pistols), force training (battle strike), gunslinger tree, etc. I like the look so far.
