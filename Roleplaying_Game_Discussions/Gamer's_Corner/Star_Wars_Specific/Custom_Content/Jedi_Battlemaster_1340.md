# Jedi Battlemaster

### **Anazider** (2007-10-21 11:02:02)

Here is my idea for a Jedi Battlemaster prestige class, some of you may have seen it on the WotC boards. I'm still in the process of refining it, but would like any constructive thoughts or criticisms on it.
Jedi Battlemaster
Minimum Heroic Level: 12th level
Skills: Use the Force
Feats: Force Sensitvity, Weapon Proficiency (Lightsabers), Weapon Focus (Lightsabers)
Talents: At least two from Lightsaber Forms, Block, Deflect, and one from either the Jedi Guardian or Duelist trees.
Special: A Jedi Battlemaster must be selected and approved by the Jedi Council, or acknowledged by a previous Battlemaster. Generally, there is only one Battlemaster per academy or temple, but more can be commissioned depending upon need.
Game Rule Information
Jedi Battlemasters have the following game statistics.
Hit Points
At each level, Jedi Battlemasters gain 1d10 hit points + their Constitution modifier.
Force Points
Jedi Battlemasters gain a number of Force Points equal to 6 + one-half their character level, rounded down, every time they gain a new level in this class.
Class Features
The following are the class features of the Jedi Battlemaster prestige class.
Defense Bonuses
At 1st level, you gain a +4 class bonus to your Reflex Defense and a +2 class bonus to your Fortitude Defense.
Fearless
You are immune to fear effects
Oneness: The Jedi Battlemaster gains a spiritual attunement with his personally crafted lightsaber. When wielding his personal lightsaber, the Battlemaster gains an additional +1 die of damage.
Talents
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th), you select a talent. The talent may be selected from the Jedi Battlemaster talent tree (presented below), the Lightsaber Combat talent tree, the Duelist talent tree (Saga Edition Core Rulebook, page 53), the Military Tactics tree, and the Lightsaber Form talent tree. No talent can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.
Jedi Battlemaster Talent Tree
Battle Meld: A Jedi Battlemaster can link the minds of other Jedi and Force Sensitives, allowing them to gain strength from each other in times of conflict. As a full-round action, you can spend a force point to give you and all force-sensitive allies within 10 squares of you an insight bonus to attack and will defense rolls equal to one-fourth your character level until the end of the encounter. This bonus does not extend to allies outside the range of the effect, even if they move within 10 squares of you later on. Allies who benefit from the Battle Meld must remain within 10 squares of you to attain the insight bonus, and they lose it if you are knocked unconscious or killed. This is a mind-affecting effect. Expending a Destiny point extends this bonus to all force-sensitive allies within the star system. Prerequisite: Greater Battle Meditation.
Falling Leaf: This technique involves spinning 360 degrees in order to build momentum for a powerful blow. The Jedi Battlemaster using this technique draws an Attack of Opportunity from any opponents that threaten him. As long as no attack against him is successful and his own attack roll succeeds, he adds double his normal class bonus to damage as if he had twice the levels that he actually possesses. Prerequisite: Power Attack and Wisdom 13.
Flowing Water: If the Jedi Battlemaster successfully uses the block talent to negate a melee attack, the Jedi Battlemaster can immediately take an Attack of Opportunity on his opponent, which counts towards the maximum number of Attacks of Opportunity he is normally allowed. Prerequisite: Soresu
Greater Battle Meditation: As a full-round action, you can spend a Force Point to give you and all allies within 8 squares of you a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and a +1 to reflex defense until the end of the encounter. This bonus does not extend to allies outside the range of the effect, even if they move within 8 squares of you later on. Allies who benefit from the Greater Battle Meditation must remain within 8 squares of you to attain the insight bonus, and they lose it if you are knocked unconscious or killed. This is a mind-affecting effect. Expending a Destiny point extends this bonus to all allies within the star system. Prerequisite: Battle Meditation.
Saber Barrier: The Jedi Battlemaster turns his entire focus to defense, using his lightsaber and telekinetic ability through the force to create a whirling barrier of light. When Fighting Defensively without attacking, the Battlemaster and anyone in a 2-square-by-2-square area adjacent to him gains a bonus to their Reflex Defense equal to his Battlemaster level.
Level BAB Special
1st +1 Defense Bonuses, Fearless, Talent
2nd +2 Oneness +1
3rd +3 Talent
4th +4 Oneness +2
5th +5 Talent

Personally I always thought that to create a Jedi Battlemaster, you just took a lot of levels in Jedi Knight and finished with a few in master. I mean, the JK PrC is already as combat-focused as it can get.
That aside though, I like it. There are a few things that strikes me as odd though:
The requirements pretty much ties up all but a few of your talents up until level 12. Perhaps drop one talent as a requirement, and instead add another skill. For instance I think it would not be unreasonable to have Initiative as a prereq
While I kind of like the idea of Oneness, wasnÂ´t one of the reasons jedi were unbalanced in RCR the massive damage they could do with their lightsabers? While he needs to be level 16 to do it, a Jedi Battlemaster could have his saber do 5d8 damage if he uses Rapid Strike or Mighty Swing, and more if he adds Power Attack to it. It may not be unbalancing, but worth to think of.
I like the fact that the Falling Leaf and Flowing Water techniques are used, but wouldnÂ´t it make more sense with Djem So as a prereq than Soresu? Djem So is the form that focuses on counterattacks and creating its own openings after all.
IÂ´m not sure about the Saber Barrier talent. Am I right in assuming that the Battlemaster uses his saber telekinetically to twirl around him and protect him and others? If so it probably should say so, otherwise people might try to use Deflect at a shot that gets past the barrier, even though theyÂ´re not really holding a saber anymore.
Nice work though <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

First off, let me say good work and nice creative thinking. You have a lot of great ideas that if refined could work nicely.
I'm looking at this PrC and things wow I would want that and that oh and that's cool too. That's usually means that's it too powerful.
Skills look fine, I do like DarthAntrax's idea about adding Initiative though. I would consider that.
The Feat prerequisites look good.
The Talents: I would suggest any 3 talents from lightsaber forms, Lightsaber Combat, or Duelist Trees
Hit Points are fine
Force Points are fine.
Defenses are fine.
Oneness is too powerful. I like the idea, but its just too much. That is why there is battlestrike.
I would suggest this,
Oneness: A Jedi Battlemaster with this ability is able to recovery battlestrike 1/day at 1st level and 2/day at 3rd, and 3/day at 5th level.
This allows that extra damage you want, but limits the usage and abuse. I also think you should make this part of your talent tree not a free ability.
Talent gains are fine, but I have some suggestions for your new blademaster tree.
**Battle Meld:** I don't think of this ability when I think of a blademaster. It seems a bit off course of the idea of "Oneness" and knowing ones blade and being the best with a blade is more that I envision. I would personally think of something else to get here, and leave this ability to the Noble class. I do see this ability if you envision a leader, general, or warlord that lead Jedi into battle.
Don't get me wrong I think its a great idea. Make sure insight bonuses stack, because I'm not sure if all insight bonuses stack... If they do then your good, but if not then change the bonus so that it stacks with your other ability Greater Battle Meditation.
**Falling Leaf:** A good idea, but can you use this with whirlwind attack? Attack every target? It's like a wild swing drawing attacks of opportunity. This seems more dark side than like side, but maybe that was your intention. I would suggest to change the name to Momentum Attack and grant this same bonus on a charge attack.
**Flowing Water:** This is a repoiste attack, and very dangerous to put a free attack in the game. Its a free attack at no cost! That's powerful. Djem-So Lightsaber Form is a lesser form of the talent you are creating, and it costs a force point and you have to take a melee hit and only once per round. Your proposing to block the melee hit and still get an immediate attack. I would utilize the existing lightsaber form talent and make flowing water an advanced feature changing it to make it more balanced.
***Here are some suggestions:***
#1 Make Djem So a prerequisite
and
#2 Once per round, when an you successfully use the Block ability, you may spend a force point as a reaction to make an immediate attack against your opponent. You might use your idea of making the attack an attack of opportunity, which counts to toward the maximum number of attacks of opportunity allowed.
or
#3 Once per round, when you successfully use the Block ability you may make an immediate attack against your opponent taking a - 5 penalty for each time you used the Block or Deflect ability since the beginning of your last turn. If you have Shi-Cho it would reduce these penalties accordingly. This allows you to do it without spending a force point, but with penalties. Still I think this is too powerful for 1 vs 1 combat.
#4 You may use the Djem So ability with out the force point cost. (You still take damage from the hit, but you can immediately attack back at no cost; the cost is being hit.)
I can think of other variants, but I will be typing all night. I just think you should rethink this ability a little bit. As you can see I am a proponent of using existing powers and abilities so that you don't go too overboard. I think your idea is sound, but the costs need to balance the ability granted. A free attack at no cost is too powerful.
**Greater Battle Meditation:** Here's how I see this ability. As a full round action, you may spend a Force point to give you and all allies withing 12 squares (you do not need line of sight for this power to work, meaning anyone behind walls, in cover, concealment or total concealment) a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and a + 1 to reflex defense until the end of the encounter. Once this power has been used any ally that not affected that comes within the range of effect does not gain the bonus, and any ally which leaves the range of effect, falls unconscious or is killed, looses the bonus. This is a mind-affecting effect. Expending a destiny points extends the bonus to all allies within the star system. Prerequisite: Battle Meditation.
**Saber Barrier:**  So if you were trained in Acrobatics and were a 5th level blade master you would grant yourself a +15 reflex bonus and allies would get a +5 reflex bonus, you could not attack, but your allies could. Honestly, I think your better off using block and deflect to create this effect. Deflect allows you to stop an attack on an adjacent target by spending a force point, and you can block/deflect anytime against yourself. Essentially, your granting the blademaster and allies within a 2 x 2 square a reflex bonus. But if your using your battle meditation you are granting them a reflex bonus. So its kind of redundant, other than the fact that you can do this power without spending a force point.
I'm not sure what you intended with Saber Barrier, but it has a cool name. I could suggest that Saber Barrier allows you to block an adjacent ally without spending a force point. At least that could be the start of what it could offer.
Good Stuff, I enjoyed replying to your post.

Since there already is an attack bonus for having a personally crafted lightsaber, maybe Oneness could build on to that? perhaps make it +1 to attack/class level, unless you think that unbalanced.

Agreed. IIRC, the battlemaster is the premiere lightsaber instructor of the jedi temple. That being, he should probably have talents that gives him an edge on lightsaber combat (talents that builds on forms, etc) and talents that helps him to instruct others. Battlemeld and Greater Battle Meditation would probably work better with some sort of Jedi Commander talent tree. How about a talent that could grant others a temporary use of one of the forms he knows? something like the officers share talent ability

The Falling Leaf technique isnÂ´t meant to be a whirlwind attack. It is simply a move that executes a 360-degree spin to build momentum for a more powerful attack. I think itÂ´s nicely done

I think #1 is good. This really is the signature move of any good Djem So practitioner. #4 is probably what I would do, but remember using Djem So doesnÂ´t mean youÂ´re hit, You can still use Block. I think the talent is good as written (except the prereqs), but maybe set a 1/round limit on it, otherwise it could be nasty when combined with Combat Reflexes and High Dex

I actually made a version of this when trying to stat Bastila Shan. I made it so that it allowed her to make a Telepathy UtF check and then use the result of that check to determine Line of Sight for any Inspiration or Leadership talents she had, as well as the Battle Meditation talent. cost a full round to maintain. I put it as a SQ for her though, it could probably be made a technique or a secret that requires Destiny or Force points to use

Removing the Force Point cost to Delfect an adjacent ally would seem reasonable. I think youÂ´d be hard pressed to use Block like this, maybe allow it for one attack, but then have your saber sent flying. Extending your lightsaber defense bonus to all within reach could also work. however I think it should be stated wether you actually hold your lightsaber or not.

Maybe a bit too much, that would mean that you would have double the attack bonus then any other class. I think increasing a permanant damage of a lightsaber should come from a special crystal and may cost more than one force point to attune. Maybe just a +1 attack to your lightsaber on top of the personal lightsaber bonus, and maybe I would go as far as +1 damage.

Good point. Heck maybe come up with a new lightsaber form.

I don't know I think power attack is enough. This is on the verge of Rage.

I like your idea alot DarthAnthrax, that's a great way to grant light of sight, and I agree it should be a full-round action, but I think he was looking for something more like activate and use immediately. But like we said earlier, I think this should be taken out and put something in here that works on lightsaber skill.

Extending your lightsaber defense bonus to all within reach could also work. however I think it should be stated wether you actually hold your lightsaber or not.
I personally think you should have to have your lightsaber ignited at the ready.

yeah, +1/level is probably too much, but maybe have it as it is written (bonus at level 2 and 4) but have it +1 attack rather than a damage die?

I wasnÂ´t sure how powerful it was meant to be, but since it had an option for extending to a full system, I just thought it was supposed to be something like BastilaÂ´s power.
