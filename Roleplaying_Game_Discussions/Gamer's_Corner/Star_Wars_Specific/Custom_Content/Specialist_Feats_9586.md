# Specialist Feats

### **simplyscribed** (2008-04-03 09:54:11)

I hit on the idea of feats that granted a skill check bonus with only a specialised portion of a skill, as well as an additional perk to make them an attractive choice. This would help characters branch out into less generic skill specialties.
Note that the bonus granted by a Specialist Feat would be a competence bonus, so it would overlap rather than stack with the bonus granted by Skill Focus. These aren't necessarily a powergamer's wet dream, therefore.
Here are some examples I threw together: No idea of the balance of these feats really, but both seem useful without being too useful.
> <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Oh God, it hurts!</span>
> You are especially adept at fooling an opponent in combat.
> **Prerequisites:** Trained in Deception.
> **Benefit:** You gain a +5 competence bonus on Deception checks to feint in combat and when attacking an opponentâ€™s Will with the â€œPlay Deadâ€ special action (see below).
> Additionally, you gain the ***Play Dead*** special action. You are skilled at looking weaker and more defeated than you actually are, perhaps even playing dead.
> As a standard action you can make yourself look weakened. Make a Deception check with a -5 penalty. Success grants you the benefits of a feint, and the following: add a +10 bonus, then compare this new result against the targetâ€™s Will Defense. If it equals the defense, the target no longer sees you as such a threat and takes a -2 penalty on his attack rolls and defenses against you until you act in a way that belies your deception.
> As a full-round action and by deliberately falling prone you can play dead. Make a Deception check with a -10 penalty. The benefits are as noted above, with the following exceptions: If you equal the targetâ€™s Will he believes you are dead and will not attack you. He is also considered flat-footed against you until you act in a way that belies your deception.
> **Special:** The skill check bonuses from this feat and the Skill Focus feat are of the same type, so do not stack.
> <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Plane-shifter</span>
> You have a knack for moving between the horizontal and vertical planes.
> **Prerequisites:** Trained in Acrobatics.
> **Benefit:** You gain a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to fall prone or stand up from prone.
> Additionally, if you choose to fall prone or stand up from prone as their normal actions, you may take 10 while doing so. This is in addition to the +5 bonus. In ordinary circumstances, and even some extraordinary circumstances, you automatically succeed.
> Finally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any skill check in a situation where the ability to fall down or stand up quickly could be of use. Deception or Stealth checks, for example. Situations where this benefit applies are left to GM discretion.
> **Special:** The skill check bonuses from this feat and the Skill Focus feat are of the same type, so do not stack.

I have no immediate plans to populate the internet with such feats for every skill use myself, so if you come up with any of your own by all means share them in this topic.

This is an easy one, but one that should be useful no matter what.
> Deep Studies
> You have a few areas of expertise.
> Prerequisites: Trained in at least one Knowledge skill.
> Benefit: You gain a +5 competence bonus to one Knowledge skill in wich you are trained.
> Also, every time you selects this feat, choose 1+Int modifier of specialized fields in a Knowledge skill in wich you are trained. Whenever making a check related to that area, you may reroll and take the better result.
> Special: The skill check bonuses from this feat and the Skill Focus feat are of the same type, so do not stack.

After looking at the proposed specialist feats, I propose this one. I prefer to have a more general rule. This helps prevent a plethora of feats with different names, but, essentially the same mechanics wise. Such as, the various +2 to two skills feats in DND, all with different names.
**IN YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE/ABILITY**
**Benefit:** You get a +5 bonus to a specific area or ability of a skill. This bonus stacks with Skill Training and Skill Focus. But, as you gain these feats, you have to narrow the area or ability.
**Special:** The GM is the final arbiter on whether it is significantly narrow area, based on whether you have Skill Focus and/or Skill Training in the area.
This feat can be used as knowing a specific area/ability and applying it to other areas (without the +5) to simulate training.
**The feat in practice**
***Applied to Knowledge (Bureaucracy).***
Untrained: In your area of expertise (Imperial Bureaucracy). You can make checks, as though trained in knowledge(bureaucracy)(+5). But, only, when dealing with imperial bureaucracies.
W/Skill Training(Bureacracy) â€“ You are considered as having Skill Focus feat(+10), but, only, when dealing with imperial bureaucracies.
W/Skill Focus(Bureacracy) There is not much you do not know about a specific area of Imperial Bureacracy. Areas can be: Legal, business, organizational structures, or even more narrowly defines like Imperial Navy. This area needs final GM approval for narrowness. You do get (+15) against this narrow area.

Have another look at my example feats, and the one presented by DarthAnthrax. Not one of them is "essentially the same mechanics wise". Aside from the +5 competence bonus they each offer a unique benefit relating to the skill specialty.

I had considered this solution, and while it has the appearance of elegance I chose to go a different route. Why? Quite simply this: The game is not designed to support a skill modifier of +15, or such a specialist feat would no doubt already exist.
*Example, RAW:* A jedi with 18 in charisma takes training in Use the Force. As his first level feat he takes Skill Focus (Use the Force). 1st level character, +14 modifier. This is possible by the rules as written, and **already** has the potential to be plain silly.
*Example, Houserule Applied:* Now, what happens if the character is human? They have another feat to spend on specialisation and suddenly they have a +19 modifier in, say, mind-affecting force uses. A minimum result of 20, at 1st level?
*Example, RAW:* By increasing the character's charisma by +1 every time you have an ability adjustment, you can net a further +2 modifier by 20th level. Add another 10 from the 1/2 level modifier. Your final modifier becomes +26
*Example, Houserule Applied:* Your final modifier in the specialist field becomes +31.
Use the Force is as always the most extreme example, but I invite you to think about a character with Acrobatics who specialises in tumbling, or a character with Deception specialised in feinting. The simple fact of the matter is that the way the system is already built, you end up with some ridiculous modifiers (and nowhere is this more true than in the Force subsystem) and there's no good reason to exarcebate the problem.
My solution solves this by not having the specialist feat and Skill Focus stack. That in turn necessitates that the feat offers some other perk so that it doesn't become useless if you choose to take Skill Focus too. The end result of having that perk is that while the solution creates the possibility of several feats for every skill to represent each skill use, each of those feats has a unique benefit that justifies its existence. Not necessarily elegant, but I would argue a solid design solution.

These are all great points. Mechanically, it is overpowering. I was trying for a more of a roleplaying aspect of expertise.
Lets face it, most *trained* people are going to be equal or have very slight difference against another *trained* person in the same skill. The same is true for *focused* vs *focused*. I was trying to come up with a feat, that would be useful at all levels of training and differentiate between two at the same level of training (*Skill Training, Skill Focus*).
It was supposed to be somewhat like a middle ground. An untrained person is going to look at a trained person, as an expert or much better than him. A trained person would acknowledge a focused person, as an expert or much better than him. There is no way for a focused person to acknowledge another, as an expert or much better than him. This is what, I wanted to simulate.
So, I have changed it to come up with this.

```
ACKNOWLEDGED EXPERT/MASTER
Benefit:  You get a +5 circumstantial bonus applied to the skill roll, only, when faced by an opposed roll of equal training or greater training (untrained, trained, focus).  People of equal level of training consider you to be/approaching the level of the next level of training.  And, those of one greater level of training, consider you to be an up-and-comer in the field or an equal.

Special:  The bonus from this feat can stack with Skill Training and/or Skill Focus, if you are opposing a roll, that was made by someone with equal or greater training level, than yourself.  The bonus does not stack with the feats against fixed DCs or people with a lesser training level.  

Against fixed DCs, this bonus is only applied to determine performing the action/task quicker, than another.  The bonus does not help you with making the DC.

The feat in practice:
A player untrained in the skill gets the circumstantial bonus always.
A player trained in the skill gets the circumstantial bonus against opposed trained or focused rolls.
A player focused  in the skill gets the circumstantial bonus only against opposed focused rolls.
```

Is that better balanced and playable?

Hm, I'd say yes. You already know my preferred solution but I think yours should be an equally good alternative for your game. I would suggest not allowing untrained characters to take it though - by definition, an untrained person cannot be an expert or master, acknowledged or otherwise.

Here I put together two more feats
**Saboteur** â€“ When using the Mechanics skill to Handle Explosives or Disable Devices, you must fail by 10 or more to receive any negative consecquenses. *Prerequistites: Trained in Mechanics*
**Programmer** â€“ You may use your Use Computer skill to improve the performance of targetting systems, sensor equipment or other gear that relies on data algorithms to function. You may modify systems in the following ways:
[ul]
[*]**Improved Targeting Algorithm** â€“ You may grant a +1 equipment bonus (or increase an already existing one) of an weapon that uses computerized systems to track targets (typically on veichles or possibly heavy weaporny).  
[*]**Advanced Mapping System** â€“ You may grant a +1 equipment bonus (or increase an already existing one) of a device or system that uses computerized systems for surveillence (typically on sensors, binoculars and helmet packages).  
[*]**Advanced Encryption Algorithm** â€“ You can make it harder for others to acess your data, by increaseing their DC to access information by 5, and making the encrypted device have an attitude of 1 category lower than normal against them.  
[*]**Improved Memory Processing** â€“ Improves the Intelligence core of any device that posseses one by 2 points. [/ul]  
Using this feat costs nothing, but a substantial amount of time and effort will be required. The amount of time required to use this feat depends on the nature of the device you are working with. For basic systems (normal computer systems, including systems found on veichles) you must spend 10 hours of work, and succeed at at DC 20 Use Computer check. For smaller systems on hand-held devices (datapads, sensor packs), you must spend a full days work and succeed at a DC 25 Use Computer check. A droid may apply this feat to himself, but the DC increases by 10 if he does. A single system may benefit from any number of upgrades from this feat (though no more then three times from any single benefit), but the time requirement doubles with each subsequent use of this feat, and the DC increases by 5. *Prerequistites: Trained in Use Computer, Int 15+*
What do you think? Please come up with some more things to use *Programmer* with <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I likes it very much. its actually a better fit for my character than Tech specialist as he's a computer person - not really an engineer
