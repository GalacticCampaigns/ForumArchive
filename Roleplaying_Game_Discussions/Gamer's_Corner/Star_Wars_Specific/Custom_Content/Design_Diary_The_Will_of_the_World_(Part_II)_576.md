# Design Diary: The Will of the World (Part II)

Where there is a first Part, there must be a second. This thread will serve much the same purpose as the last.

By my calculations, my PCs should get 1,410 experience from Part I, plus a little extra as roleplaying rewards and maybe a bit more if both Hobben guides die before the second fight is concluded. Since they currently have 6,200 experience, that's not nearly enough for them to level, so Part II still needs to be geared towards level 4 characters. That's good to know.
I won't necessarily do so, but it may be worth designing Part II to get the PCs to 5th level. That would require awarding about 2,300 experience. Also good to know.
So, Part I left on a bit of a cliffhanger. What has actually happened?
Reba and Eric were out beyond the mountains, training with Hunter-Shamans from the Inlu'la village. They were attacked by Hobben from another nearby village, whose Shamans had learned of Reba and Eric's presence on the planet. Jealous of the Inlu'la's exposure to Quixis Kolle, who taught the Inlu'la Shamans Jedi techniques, they felt it profoundly unfair that the Inlu'la should also have these new offworlders and resolved to take them by force. Reba and Eric are now prisoners of the Aeng'la village.
This adventure will therefore focus on finding and rescuing Reba and Eric, a difficult task for non-Hobben strangers still weary from a hard journey.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Adventure Summary (Incomplete)</span>
**Disaster:** The party have found the Hunter-Shaman camp, only to find the Hobben dead and Eric and Reba gone. It's clear that Hobben from a rival village are behind the attack.
*Skill Check:* DC 10 Perception checks can uncover the trail back to the Aeng'la village.
**Journey to the Aeng'la:** The journey to the Aeng'la village takes several days. If the PCs choose to return to the Inlu'la village instead, it requires about the same time. Either way, they may be subject to random attacks from the Beasts and Hazards in the appendices of this adventure and The Will of the World (Part 1), or any suitable challenges you find in other sources.

Lots of new notes I made this morning, which I'll organise into coherency and flesh out later:
[ul][*]Village is surrounded by cliff on one side and a river on the other. Only a thin strip of land between the two on the south-west side of the village allows crossing. This is further reduced by a tall wooden fence built out from the cliff edge, leaving only two metres of space between the fence and the river. The river is fordable, but is a major inconvenience to anyone wanting to sneak into or attack the village (sorry, PCs).  
[*]Approach by stealth is the way forward but it cannot realistically be attempted during the day. Even if one or more of the PCs are Zabrak or even Hobben they are still strangers in the small, close-knit community.  
[*]Night approach requires avoiding the attention of the lookouts. There is always a guard in a tower in the village's centre (he can see over all the buildings to the river), one by the fence, and one atop the cliff.  
[*]The Jedi are not being held prisoner in the village. The only possible location is within the cliff… perhaps if they follow the river where it exits the cliff face…  
[*]I have notes for the cavern too but it's in map form so I can't really type that up.  
[*]New Beast: Catcher Croc - Like a crocodile with elongated legs and a prehensile neck. Has a long sticky tongue rolled up inside it that it lashes out at reach to snare prey. Trained by the Hobben to guard the caves, they live in the river.  
[*]New Beast: Blood Bat - A nest of these has taken up residence in the caves, much to the aggravation of the Shamans. Blood Bats are dangerous pests. Much larger than a regular bat (Small), it has an elongated face that tapers into a large needle-like appendage rather than a mouth. It has no legs, instead having a long thin tail that ends in two vicious looking hooks. Similar, smaller hooks are found atop its wings. Like a mosquito, Blood Bats suck the blood from their victims. Unlike a mosquito, which injects a painkiller, Blood Bats cause incredible amounts of pain. First they latch onto the victim with their hooks, then insert their "mouth", then inject the prey with an agent that waters down their blood making it easier to drink. This latter part of the process, of course, makes the blood loss caused by wounds (such as those made by the Blood Bat's hooks) more severe, a very unwelcome fact given the Blood Bat is already feeding on the poor victim's blood. The victim quickly becomes light-headed and may even (mercifully perhaps) black out before dying. Also like a mosquito, Blood Bats can carry disease from victim to victim. Unsurprisingly, the Shamans are avoiding the area of the caves the bats have taken over, and are trying to get rid of them by way of fresh, bloody meat - poisoned, of course. [/ul]
