# Houserule: Open Class System

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-06 21:00:15)

Those who know me from before "The Absence" know me to be a chronic tinkerer. Those who don't must surely have found out by now given my posts today.
Anyhoo, here's the result of a discussion about making a more transparent system for character creation and levelling I had with Anazider in chat just now. These are the ideas I proposed there, simply formalised into a document.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">OPEN CLASS SYSTEM</span>
This variant alters the way in which the class system works with the aim of opening up character options and removing barriers to creative character design. It is a mistake to think OCS is a classless system as it retains certain class-based features, however, excepting specific points, class has very little impact on character progression.
At a glance, the Open Class System does the following:
â€¢ Retains class selection at 1st level. A generic classless system where everybody receives an identical starting package would have little flavour, and it occurs that requiring a player to prioritise hit points, skills, and class features according to their concept is more interesting than providing open access at onceâ€”creativity best flourishes upon freedom from a period of constraint, after all.
â€¢ Effectively treats all characters as multiclassing into a generic class upon reaching level 2. From then on, they do gain all the same mechanical benefitsâ€”at this point, the OCS does become for all intents and purposes classless.
â€¢ Keeps the essence of prestige classes, by converting them into Heroic Careers. Heroic Careers retain prerequisites, as well as their unique benefits, but the talent trees attached to them are moved to the open domain.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">THE 1ST LEVEL CHARACTER</span>
When creating a 1st level character for use with the Open Class System, bear in mind the following:
â€¢ Your species benefits remain identical, with the following exceptionâ€”If your species provides a benefit that improves your use of a skill, you may treat that skill as though it were on your class list for the purpose of skill selection. In the case of a Human character, you may select any single skill not already on your class list and treat is as though it were. Naturally, you are not required to select that skill.
â€¢ You must select a starting class as stated by the SECR. The benefits of the starting class, including hit points, initial feats, base attack, and skill selection are all identical.
â€¢ You may select your 1st level talent from any talent tree accessible by a base class.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">EVEN LEVELS</span>
At second level, and every even level thereafter your character receives the followingâ€”
â€¢ d8 + Constitution modifier hit points.
â€¢ +1 to base attack.
â€¢ Any feat for which he qualifies, with the exception of feats that can only be selected for slots made available by merit of heroic level. At eighth level and every even level thereafter, you may take either a feat, or gain the use of a unique feature belonging to one of your heroic careers.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">ODD LEVELS</span>
At third level, and every odd level thereafter your character receives the followingâ€”
â€¢ d8 + Constitution modifier hit points.
â€¢ +1 to base attack.
â€¢ Any talent for which he qualifies from any talent tree accessible by a base class (or from any talent tree associated with a heroic career, once he meets its level prerequisite).
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">DEFENSE BOOSTS</span>
At 2nd level, you may improve the class bonus of one of your defenses by +1 (no defense bonus may be raised higher than +2 in this manner). You may improve a defense by +1 again at 5th level.
*(These are intended to offset defense bonuses that would otherwise have been gained through multiclassing).*
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">&quot;MULTI-SKILL&quot; FEATS</span>
At fifth, tenth, and fifteenth levels, you may select a single feat you do not currently possess from the initial list of any base class.
*(These are intended to offset feats that would otherwise have been gained through multiclassing).*
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">LEVEL-DEPENDENT BENEFITS</span>
Remain the same.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">HEROIC CAREERS</span>
Using the OCS, Prestige Classes become Heroic Careers. A Heroic Career effects the game in the following ways:
â€¢ The Heroic Career retains the prerequisites it had as a Prestige Class. These must be matched before entry, and a character can only claim to have entered a Heroic Career the level after they met all of its prerequisites.
â€¢ The Heroic Career provides its existing Defense bonuses.
â€¢ The Heroic Career retains all the unique features it provides at even levels. For those derived from prestige classes in the SECR, these are:
> o **Ace Pilot:** Vehicle Dodge
> o **Bounty Hunter:** Familiar Foe
> o **Crime Lord:** Bonus Talent (note - this talent must be from a tree belonging to the Crime Lord list).
> o **Elite Trooper:** Damage Reduction
> o **Force Adept, Jedi Knight, Sith Apprentice:** Force Technique
> o **Force Disciple, Jedi Master, Sith Lord:** Force Secret
> o **Gunslinger:** Trusty Sidearm
> o **Officer:** Share Talent

â€¢ The Heroic Career also retains any once-off benefits, such as Command Cover, Delay Damage, Fearless, Serenity, and Temptation.
â€¢ The talent trees associated with Heroic Careers are open domain, meaning that any character can take them, even if they do not belong to the associated Heroic Career. However, all such talents have a minimum level prerequisite equal to the minimum level required to enter the associated Heroic Career.
â€¢ It is recommended to keep track of the amount of levels you've belonged to each Heroic Career. However, since Heroic Careers no longer count as full classes, I would suggest treating them as subclasses and therefore changing the format to something like the following: "Jedi 14 (Jedi Knight 5, Jedi Master 2)".
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">GOING WITHOUT</span>
If you haven't gained entry to a first tier Heroic Career by level 8 (and thereby gained the defense bonuses associated with that Heroic Career), your class bonuses for Fortitude, Reflex, and Willpower become +2. If you haven't gained entry to a second tier Heroic Career by level 13, your class bonuses for Fortitude, Reflex, and Willpower become +3.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">OPEN ACCESS AND THE FORCE</span>
Though all characters are allowed access to all talents, they must still meet the prerequisites of those talents. In many cases, particularly with talents associated with Force-using classes, there are implicit prerequisites that have not been spelled out in the text. For clarity, then, it is noted that a character without access to the Force cannot take a talent that obviously relies on access to the Force in order to function.
<span style="font-size: 1.75em;">THE BENEFITS TABLE, AND THE OPTIONAL &quot;THREE-TIER&quot; VERSION</span>
[http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=r67_Gxk-oiOt7XwUvyWE-8Q&amp;hl=en](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=r67_Gxk-oiOt7XwUvyWE-8Q&amp;hl=en "http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=r67_Gxk-oiOt7XwUvyWE-8Q&amp;hl=en")
The above link leads to a table expressing the benefits provided by OCS, level by level. That should help you to grasp how it works.
A common complaint has been that the progression of OCS doesn't grant equivalent class features to a similarly-leveled character built using the original system. Truthfully, that doesn't matter too much since OCS assumes all characters are built using its own progression.
However, I have designed a variant progression from levels 8 onward that should rectify the issue for those that have it - use whichever version is better for yourself and your group. Find this progression below the main table. This version assumes that with the original system you would muticlass into a prestige class at 8th level then a second-tier prestige class at 13th level.
The benefits of this method are as follows:

* Improved balance between characters created using either system. This may help GMs in a rush if they need to use NPC statblocks and don't have time to convert them to OCS.
* Easier conversion of higher level characters to OCS.#
* This model creates a distinction between three tiers of play, rather like D&D 4e does. It's not really a benefit, but its a nice accidental feature. The three tiers are levels 0-7, 8-13, and 14-20. Each tier is distinguished by a "reset" of the level benefits progression so that at the start of each tier the character earns a talent.

I *really* like this concept. Personally I've always thought lower hit points and BAB were a pretty steep price for access to certain talents. I have a couple questions though.
1) Do you gain a feat every other level after declaring a Heroic Career? That would give you a lot more feats than normal but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
2) Do you still "take levels" in Heroic Careers separately? Otherwise keeping track of different HC unique features would seem difficult. For example a Jedi master would look like Jedi 7/Jedi Knight 5/Jedi Master 2, not Jedi Master 14, correct?

Oho, well spotted. I'll have to think about that one, as any solution could overcomplicate things.
I would be tempted, though, to allow players the choice each time they would normally gain the unique feature to instead take an additional feat and by doing so maintain the flexible nature of the system.

Yes, it would be recommended to keep track of the amount of levels you've belonged to each Heroic Career. However, since Heroic Careers no longer count as full classes, I would suggest treating them as subclasses and therefore changing the format to something like the following:
"Jedi 14 (Jedi Knight 5, Jedi Master 2)".

Hmm, maybe. That would be a much easier choice for some Heroic Careers than others though. For example, I'd take an extra feat over the Gunslinger's Trusty Sidearm feature anytime, but the Bounty Hunter's Familiar Foe would be much harder to pass up. Maybe that's OK though.

Looks good to me.

What about the additional points in defenses possible from multiclassing? Maybe along with the feat every five levels one defense may be raised by one point?

Not a bad idea, Alicia.

I'm not sure that's really necessary. You still get the defense bonuses from Heroic Careers so you just have to wait a little longer than you would by multiclassing. In fact you'd actually be increasing defenses higher than the class-based system once you've gotten some of those Heroic Careers under your belt.

### **Anazider** (2009-06-08 22:40:32)

Hmm... if I'm doing this correctly, doing a 10 level build with a human, with a breakdown of Jedi 7 / Soldier 1 / Jedi Knight 2, and the Open class system of Jedi 10 (Jedi Knight 2), I end getting three less feats and one less talent. Is this purposeful?

---

### **Valheru** (2009-06-09 00:37:07)

Well lets see...
Standard System
1 Jedi 1 Jedi Starting Feats(3), Jedi Talent, Feat
2 Jedi 2 Jedi Bonus Feat
3 Jedi 3 Feat, Jedi Talent
4 Jedi 4 Jedi Bonus Feat
5 Jedi 5 Jedi Talent
6 Jedi 6 Feat, Jedi Bonus Feat
7 Jedi 7 Jedi Talent
8 Soldier 1 Soldier Starting Feat, Soldier Talent
9 Knight 1 Feat, Knight Talent
10 Knight 2 Force Technique
Feats: 11, Talents: 6, Techniques: 1
Open Class System
1 Jedi 1 Jedi Starting Feats(3), Talent, Feat
2 Jedi 2 Feat
3 Jedi 3 Feat, Talent
4 Jedi 4 Feat
5 Jedi 5 Talent, Starting Feat
6 Jedi 6 Feat, Feat
7 Jedi 7 Talent
8 Jedi 8 Feat
9 Knight 1 Feat, Talent
10 Knight 2 Force Technique or Feat, Starting Feat
Feats: 13 or 14, Talents: 5, Techniques : 1 or 0
So the OCS gave 2 more feats (or 3 at the cost of a Technique but who's gonna pick a feat over Force Point Recovery) but 1 less talent. That's a fair trade in my mind, especially considering the freedom you have to pick those talents and feats. Did you leave out the "normal" feats gained at 1, 3, 6, 9? Simplyscribed didn't specifically mention them but I'm pretty sure those still apply (along with the stat bumps every 4 levels). Also why do Jedi 10 (Jedi Knight 2) as opposed to Jedi 10 (Jedi Knight 3)?

This is what I have, as I've built a character with both systems, trying to encompass the same build. I do not count starting feats within the mix because both systems offer the same. The character is a human.
Standard
1 Jedi 2 Feats - 1 Talent
2 Jedi 1 Feat
3 Jedi 1 Feat - 1 Talent
4 Jedi 1 Feat
5 Jedi 1 Talent
6 Jedi 2 Feat
7 Jedi 1 Talent
8 Soldier 1 Feat (multiclass starter feat) - 1 Talent
9 Jedi Knight 1 Feat - 1 Talent
10 Jedi Knight 1 Force Technique
Feats: 9, Talents: 6, Force Techniques: 1
OCS
1 Jedi 2 Feats - 1 Talent
2 Jedi 1 Feat
3 Jedi 1 Talent
4 Jedi 1 Feat
5 Jedi 1 Feat (multiclass starter) - 1 Talent
6 Jedi 1 Feat
7 Jedi 1 Talent
8 Jedi Knight 1 Feat
9 Jedi Knight 1 Talent
10 Jedi Knight 1 Force Technique
Feats: 7, Talents: 5 Force Techniques: 1
And from there on I have to decide if I want the Prestige Class-based benefit, or a feat. While appearing to offer more options to define a build, the system in its current incarnation, does not. It is explicitly stated that you gain feats at even levels and talents at odd, so then you do not gain feats at levels that are multiples of 3.
The point of the system is not to make a "trade off" but to provide something that is identical in output but different in structure. As it currently stands, the system is drastically different in both output and structure.

See SECR Table 3-1 on page 37 for level-based benefts, which includes, *drumroll*, feats every 3 levels! So yeah, I did in fact cover this.
With regard to the talent, you're naturally going to lose a talent slot or two if you convert a character that was multiclassed. This is a direct consequence of eliminating multiclassing - c'est la vie. Just reemember that everyone is in the same boat an that you have a much wider choice of talents with which to fill those slots you have.

> Remain the same.

The Core Rulebook calls them "Level-Dependent Benefits" but I assumed he was referring to the feats gained at levels which are multiples of 3 and the ability increases gained every 4th level. If he meant something else then I suppose you are correct, but I don't see the point of removing these features.
The point of the OCS is, as he expressly stated, to open up character options. I don't think output *needs* to be the exact same, just roughly equivalent. In fact if we eliminate multiclassing it'll be very difficult to exactly match all the possible outcomes in the normal system. For example, you could take one level of each base class to really load up on talents in a short amount of time. Of course each of those talents would be from a different class (with the exception of Force Talents), you'd have a weak BAB, and your selection of "non level-dependent" feats would be limited to the starting feats of each class; a pretty hefty price to pay for all those talents. How could the OCS replicate this? Well I don't think it needs to. The output is roughly the same unless you multiclass to the extreme.
EDIT: Doh, you beat me to it scribed :P

Heh. This is a consequence of creating the OCS without reference to the book, but from memory. Still, it's semantics - "based on"/"dependant on"... I figure it's pretty clear what I was referring to, but it's a small section so could have been missed.
Anyhoo, I will edit it to say dependent, so that in future no one has an excuse.

Dude, I reread this thing three or four times and had a couple of other folks in the chat run into the same issue, and I did not see this!
Anyhoo, I still have my druthers about the system, but I think that may be more from not seeing a necessity for the system rather than on the merits of OCS itself. At an outside glance it still feels as though I'm losing something here, and I hope that it translates well into the greater framework of Saga, since SE is so predicated on multi-classing. With this system, I could fit the entire feat structure of a 20 level build within the first ten levels, and that eh... Just doesn't feel overly right, even going in knowing that the whole structure is alien. There's also the somewhat cooke-cutter feel of everyone having the same hit die from level 2 up to 20.
Its past 4 AM and I haven't been to sleep yet, so I think I might be rambling.

Saga does this with other things, though - level-based skill modifiers, damage bonuses, defense bonuses... And yet arbitrarily decides to keep other things different. The choice I've made for OCS to add hit points to the arbitrary cookie-cutter list doesn't really make things so different.
I'm in the habit of giving my players maximum possible hit points anyway, as I hate the potentially imbalancing effects of randomising it, so in my games at least OCS won't represent a huge change - my players are used to having very similar hit points to each other.

### **Alicia** (2009-06-09 07:25:24)

I feel in the end I'm being jipped out of a talent. When multiclassing (generally at 8th level) you get access to a talent. In some builds the feat instead would be nice but I know with the build I'm making for your game I'd rather have that talent than the feat.

I second this, and also I was thinking how do you handle if I want to take class features from multiple heroic careers? LetÂ´s say I want to be primarily a force using pilot, so IÂ´ll settle for Ace Pilot, but I also want a single specific Force Technique, how would I go about that?

It would be possible to "reset" the talent/feat progression each time characters hit one of the heroic career tiers, which would address that specific issue. I can't help but feel that it would be an overcomplication though. You're only truly being gipped out of a talent if it's only you - since everyone else in the same boat, I guess I just didn't see it being such a big issue. :P

As long as you meet the prerequisites for Force Adept, Jedi Knight, or Sith Apprentice, you can be considered a member of that heroic career. When you get to choose a unique class feature, it could be from either of your heroic careers.

How bout this solution at 8th level you can choose between a talent, feat or the Career ability? ;D

I've been thinking that myself, Thraken. And a complication like a talent/feat order reset when you get a heroic career wouldn't look nearly so complicated when spelled out as part of a table...

Eh... I don't think I am representing myself well, so let me try it this way:
Prince Anazider has lived in the lap of luxury his entire life. He's wanted for nothing, and while he's had some martial training from some of the best marksmen and martial artists the galaxy over, he's never been in anything remotely resembling an armed conflict. Using the standard system at level 10, we'll give Anazider Noble 7 / Crime Lord 3 and with max hitpoints and constitution 10, he ends up with 78 hit points. His toughness is in his mental accumen and ruthlessness, not necessarily ability to take a punch.
Yvanus Targo is a hard-bitten Mandalorian Mercenary, who has known battle his whole life and has fought across countless star systems. Every scar, scrape, and ounce of experience has been learned in the midst of war. Using the standard system at level 10, we'll give Yvanus Soldier 7 / Elite Trooper 3, and for the sake of the experiment a constitution of 10 and max hitpoints. He ends up with 126. He's a Mandalorian juggernaut that'll win the day through broken bones and indomitable spirit.
Using OCS and ET Anazider ends up with 5 ET (90 hit points) and Yvanus with 6 ET (102 hit points). The battle tested Mandalorian can take exactly one more hit then the pampered noble, and as I've shown in the chat, with average damage you are guaranteed to drop someone, or be dropped, along the ET with every hit. Using average damage from a blaster rifle (3d8), in the standard system Anazider is able to take 5 shots, and Yvanus 9. That also doesn't account for random extrema, which will either pro-long or shorten the encounter for either character, but Yvanus generally wins out.
I'm posting my character in addition to this, and am more than willing to test this stuff, but conceptually these are some of my concerns.

This is more a critique of ET than it is one of OCS. How the two variant systems interact is a reasonable concern for Ripples in the Deep, in which I hope to use both, but it isn't fair to do so in an analysis which should only be about OCS.
I will respond to it, though - I think this is a slightly flawed comparison, myself, because using the standard system damage will hardly ever be average. And maybe I just play with lucky people, but it usually winds up being higher than average. It's not really right therefore to assume a fair comparison can be made using the average value between a system where that value rarely comes up and a system where it's guaranteed to. I'm not saying your concern isn't a legitimate one, merely that whether you are right or wrong in the end - the situation is probably not as cut and dry as your analysis suggests.

Please note also, while we're still off-topic, that I have already commited myself to reviewing and hopefully improving the ET houserule.

The above link leads to a table expressing the benefits provided by OCS, level by level. That should help you to grasp how it works.
If you scroll down below the table, there's a hypothetical structure for levels 8-20 that more closely emulates the benefits progression of the standard system assuming you multiclassed into the first one prestige class and then a higher tier prestige class. This would be my preferred solution to the issue people have with losing a talent. As a minor side benefit, it clearly breaks up a character's career into three units, a bit like D&D 4e's heroic, paragon, and epic tiers. Let me know your thoughts.
