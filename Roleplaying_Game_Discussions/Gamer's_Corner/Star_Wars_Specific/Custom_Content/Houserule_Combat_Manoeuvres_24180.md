# Houserule: Combat Manoeuvres

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-06 12:24:34)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Combat Manoeuvres</span>
This variant rule was created a few months ago, and seeks to help even out the power discrepancy between Force users and other characters. Please bear in mind it has had little to no playtesting, so design balance is currently based on theoretical comparisons to existing systems alone.
Constructive critique and commentary are welcome, as are suggestions/designs for further manouevres!
Combat Manoeuvres are mechanically similar to Force powers (and Starship Manouevres), but rather than being tied to a single skill, they can be tied to a number of different skills, or attack rolls, according to the nature of the manoeuvre.
You may find that some manoeuvres have similar benefits to existing mechanical features. In these cases, it is usually best to limit players from taking the existing mechanic in favour of the manoeuvre, in order to avoid redundancies and potential problems. Some recommended changes are noted in the manoeuvre descriptions.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">New Feat: Combat Manoeuvres</span>
**Benefit:** You add to your Manoeuvre suite a number of Manoeuvres equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can add the same power more than once.
**Special:** You can take this feat more than once. Each time you take this feat, you add to your Manoeuvre suite a number of new Manoeuvres equal to your Wisdom modifier.
If your Wisdom modifier permanently increases, you immediately gain a number of Manoeuvres equal to the number of Learn Manoeuvres feats you have taken.
<span style="font-size: 1.75em;">Manoeuvre List</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Acrobatic Attack</span>
In a series of unpredictable leaps and rolls, you pass an opponent and strike them. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** One target up to 6 squares away from you.
**Make an Acrobatics check and move up to 6 squares.** Compare the result to the Reflex Defense of one target that is within your reach at any point during the movement. If the check result equals or exceeds the targetâ€™s Reflex Defense, you deal damage according to the weapon used.
*DC 15â€”*you can move as though tumbling (see the Acrobatics skill).
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to tumble through occupied and threatened squares without paying double movement.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Aggressive Stance</span>
You aim blow after blow on the enemy, never letting up. **Time:** Swift action. **Target:** Yourself.
**Make a melee attack roll.** The result of the check determines the effects of this manoeuvre, if any:
*DC 15â€”*Gain a +1 bonus to any attack rolls you make before your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to Reflex Defense for the same duration.
*DC 20â€”*Gain a +2 bonus to any attack rolls you make before your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to Reflex Defense for the same duration.
*DC 25â€”*Gain a +3 bonus to any attack rolls you make before your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to Reflex Defense for the same duration.
**Special:** You can sustain aggressive stance by spending a swift action each round to do so. Alternatively, you may spend a Destiny point to extend the benefits of aggressive stance for the duration of the encounter, without the Reflex penalty or the need to maintain with swift actions.
When in aggressive stance, you can spend a Force Point to deal +1d6 damage to a target of your melee attack.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Assassinâ€™s Rush </span>
You strike without warning, bearing down on your target before they have time to react. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** One target up to 6 squares away from you, who is considered flat-footed.
**Make a Deception check and move up to 6 squares in a line.** Compare the result to the Reflex Defense of the target. If the check result equals or exceeds the targetâ€™s Reflex Defense, you deal damage according to the weapon used and can apply any effect that targetâ€™s flat-footed enemies.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to deal +1d6 damage and move the target one step along the condition track.
If the target is not aware of you at the time you use this manoeuvre, you can substitute a Stealth check for the Deception check, and receive a +5 bonus to your roll.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Combined Fire</span>
You coordinate your fire with one or more allies. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** One or more targets fired on by an ally.
**Hold your action until an ally makes a ranged attack, then make a ranged attack roll.** Compare the result to the Reflex Defense of the target (or targets) of your allyâ€™s attack. If their Reflex is equalled or exceeded they take an additional die of damage from the opponentâ€™s attack.
*DC 15â€”*you are also treated as using the aid another action for your ally, whether or not you successfully beat the targetâ€™s Reflex.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to improve your allyâ€™s damage bonus by an additional die.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Crushing Charge</span>
You charge forward with such force you push your opponents with you. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** special.
**Make a melee attack roll and move up to 6 squares (minimum 2) in a line.** As part of the movement you can move through squares occupied by opponents, though you cannot end your movement in an occupied square. The result of the check is compared to the Reflex Defense of all opponents occupying squares in and adjacent to the line. Each target whose Reflex is equalled or exceeded takes damage according to the weapon used and is knocked prone. If the result is less than a targetâ€™s Reflex Defense, it takes half damage and is not knocked prone. Additionally, a missed target can make an opportunity attack against you. This is an area effect.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to gain a +5 bonus to Reflex against attacks of opportunity provoked by your charge.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Dodging Defense</span>
***(This manoeuvre replaces the Dodge feat).***
With all the lithe grace of a dancer, you slip past your enemyâ€™s attack. **Time:** Reaction. **Target:** one attack made against you.
**Make an Acrobatics check.** Compare the result to the attack roll of the creature that attacked you. If it equals or exceeds the attack roll, their attack misses.
**Special:** You must be aware of the attack (and not flat-footed) to sue this manouevre.
When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to immediately withdraw up to 2 squares as part of the reaction. If you spend a destiny point, you may apply your Acrobatics roll as a defense against all further weapon or unarmed attacks made against you this round. You decide to spend the destiny point after finding out your check result.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Evasive Manoeuvring</span>
***(This manoeuvre replaces the Vehicular Combat feat; it can also be bought as a Starship Manoeuvre).***
You know how to jink and juke to avoid enemy fire. Time: Reaction. Target: one attack made against you or the vehicle you are piloting.
**Make a Pilot check.** Compare the result to the attack roll of the creature or vehicle that attacked you. If it equals or exceeds the attack roll, their attack misses.
**Special:** You must be aware of the attack (and not flat-footed) to sue this manouevre.
When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to immediately withdraw your vehicle up to 2 squares as part of the reaction. If you spend a destiny point, you may apply your Pilot roll as a defense against all further weapon or unarmed attacks made against you or your vehicle this round. You decide to spend the destiny point after finding out your check result.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Lightning Strike</span>
Before your target knows whatâ€™s happening, your weapon is drawn and you have made a potentially fatal attack. **Time:** Swift action. **Target:** one enemy within reach or in range.
**Make a Deception check.** Compare the result to the Willpower Defense of the target. If it equals or exceeds their defense, deal damage according to the weapon used.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to treat the target as flat-footed if they werenâ€™t already.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Master Grenadier</span>
You can place explosives in such a way to maximise the destruction caused. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** All opponents in the explosiveâ€™s burst area.
Make a Demolitions check. Compare the result to the Reflex Defense of the targets. If it equals or exceeds their defenses, deal damage according to the weapon used plus an additional die.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to deal a second additional die of damage to targets in the area.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Ready Stance</span>
You go on the defensive, aware of your opponentsâ€™ moves and able to react swiftly in the face of attack. **Time:** Swift action. **Target:** Yourself.
**Make a Perception check.** The result of the check determines the effects of this manoeuvre, if any:
*DC 15â€”*Gain a +1 bonus to all defenses against melee or ranged weapon attacks made against you until the end of your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to your own attacks for the same duration.
*DC 20â€”*Gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against melee or ranged weapon attacks made against you until the end of your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to your own attacks for the same duration.
*DC 25â€”*Gain a +3 bonus to all defenses against melee or ranged weapon attacks made against you until the end of your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to your own attacks for the same duration.
**Special:** You can sustain ready stance by spending a swift action each round to do so. Alternatively, you may spend a Destiny point to extend the benefits of ready stance for the duration of the encounter, without the attack penalty or the need to maintain with swift actions.
When in ready stance, you can spend a Force Point to deal improve your Damage Threshold by 5 against one attack. You may do so after discovering the effects of that attack.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Reflexive Defense</span>
Your instincts are finely honed, causing your body to react to danger before your conscious is even aware there was a threat. **Time:** Reaction. **Target:** One attack made against you.
**Make an Initiative check.** Compare the result to the attack roll of the creature that attacked you. If it equals or exceeds the attack roll, their attack misses.
**Special:** You must be aware of the attack (and not flat-footed) to sue this manouevre.
When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to immediately withdraw up to 2 squares as part of the reaction. If you spend a destiny point, you may apply your Acrobatics roll as a defense against all further weapon or unarmed attacks made against you this round. You decide to spend the destiny point after finding out your check result.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Roll With The Blow</span>
You know how to minimise the damage dealt by enemy attacks. **Time:** Reaction. **Target:** one attack made against you that deals weapon damage (including unarmed attacks).
**Make an Endurance check.** Compare the result to the damage of an attack that hit you. If it equals or exceeds the damage, the attack's damage is halved. Condition Track penalties are also reduced by one.
**Special:** You must be aware of the attack (and not flat-footed) to sue this manouevre.
When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to gain a +10 bonus to your Endurance roll. If you spend a destiny point, you may apply your Endurance roll as a defense against all further weapon or unarmed attacks made against you this round. You decide to spend the destiny point after finding out your check result.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Skirmisherâ€™s Withdrawal</span>
You back away from your enemies, taking the opportunity to strike at one of them as you go. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** one enemy within reach at any point during your movement.
**Make a melee attack roll and move up to 6 squares.** You do not provoke opportunity attacks as part of this movement. Compare the result of the check to the Reflex Defense of any legal target you pass during the movement. If it equals or exceeds their defense, deal damage according to the weapon used.

**Make a ranged attack roll with an autofire weapon.** The area of the attack is extended to 3Ã—3.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to extend the attackâ€™s area to 4Ã—4.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Surgical Precision</span>
Your intimate knowledge of anatomy makes your attacks especially deadly. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** one enemy within range.
**Make a Treat Injury check.** Compare the result to the Fortitude Defense of the target. If it equals or exceeds their defense, deal damage according to the weapon used.

This is the only one of your posts that I will comment on, since I noticed that the reason I didnÂ´t get very interested in the others is because they simply wasnÂ´t for me, as they changes things I already think is good with the system. They were really good ideas though, for those who wants to use them.
This however, I will check more into, much since IÂ´ve been doing something very similar to my fantasy adaption of Saga.
**Acrobatic Attack** - I think itÂ´s a little too powerful to allow a skill check to automatically deal damage. Especially at low levels, since the Skills vs Defenses balance is quite off them. Just look at Use the Force.
**AssassinÂ´s Rush** - See Acrobatic Attack.
**Lightning Strike** - See Acrobatic Attack.
**Master Grenadier** - See Acrobatic Attack.
**Roll with the Blow** - Does it really negate the attack? If so, it seems too powerful, as that would affect anything that doesnÂ´t rely on the amount of dealt damage, such as HunterÂ´s Mark or Debilitating Shot. But given the name, it might not be meant to be used against ranged attacks?
**Surgical Precision** - See Acrobatic Attack.
As you can see, most of my concerns regards the same thing. Just because Use the Force is quite unbalanced at the lower levels, that doesnÂ´t mean other skills has to be as well. Also, if you havenÂ´t checked it out, you should throw a glance at the Jedi Academy Training Guide and its new Lightsaber Form powers. You might be able to find ideas there.
Finally, I thought it was spelled *Maneuvers* ;)

Fair enough.

Umm, I invite you to look at Force Lightning. Use the Force (a skill) versus Reflex, allows you to deal 8d6 damage and automatically move the target down the condition track. Force Slam targets Fortitude, deals 4d6 damage to all targets within a 6 square cone and knocks them prone.
I believe it's perfectly acceptable for a skill check to result in damage dealt, as this is meant to be a system that rebalances non-Forcies with Forcies. That can't happen if I gimp it to be less effective than Force Powers. By the by, at least with Manouevres not all of them are tied to a *single* skill.

I have reworked this power. It works against all weapon attacks, and halves the damage dealt as well as reducing any Condition Track damage by 1. This should bring it roughly in line with the power Negate Energy.

I disagree. Your suggestion to deliberately gimp other skills prevent this system from achieving its goal - which is to reduce, as much as possible, the power difference between Forcies and non-Forcies. There are two fair ways to attempt this - give non-Forcies access to equally powerful options (which I have done), or give them access to less powerful options and at the same time reduce the utility of existing Force Powers. That would take a great deal more work, and would be a great deal less popular.

Only if you're a lazy American. Remember, I'm English - I spell differently, but no less (and arguably, among elitists, *more*) correctly. If you end up using these you're welcome to change the spelling.

Exactly, thatÂ´s pretty seriously powerful. Use the Force vs Defenses at low levels is not very balanced, I agree completely. But that was my point. They already used a skill in the way you proposes, and as we know how that turned out, why do it again?

I understand your point, but would suggest working the other way around. Bring Force Powers into check, rather than raising other skills to their level.

I think that makes it more powerful than Negate Energy, as that power can do nothing against powers like the aforementioned talents of (just for example), HunterÂ´s Mark and Debilitating Shot, unless it manages to negate all the damage done. If I understand you correctly, it also work against all kinds of weapons and damage types, and that should be enough advantage over NE I think.
As a suggestion also, IÂ´d make Initiative and not Endurance the skill to use, or else rename the maneuver. In my experience of training martial arts, "rolling with the blow" is not at all about being able to endure getting the hit, but rather reacting at the precise moment to shift your body along with the attack. And I donÂ´t think it is appropriate against high-speed weapons (meaning pretty much any ranged weapon), as you canÂ´t possibly react that fast.

Like I said before, I am far more in favor of your last suggestion. Not perhaps reduce the power and utility of Force powers, but change how they works. And yes, it *was* a lot of work. But it seems to work out fine.

That comment was mostly for fun, but since I donÂ´t have English as my native language (although I consider myself pretty good at it), I became curious if there were multiple ways to spell it.

All kinds of weapons, yes. All types of damage, no. It could do nothing against damage caused by a Force power, for example.
Also, Negate Energy is liked to be min-maxed more effectively. Because all Force powers work off one skill, that skill is commonly going to be maximised with Skill Focus. Only this one manouevre is based off Endurance, so there is little for a player ot gain by taking Skill Focus. In a majority of cases, therefore, it's less likely to work. I'd also suggest that just because the power is mathematically half as good as Negate Energy, that in terms of real play there is a clear advantage to a full negation over taking half and still being at risk of the attack beating your damage threshold (in the case of crits, etc.).

While it is true it probably needs to be renamed, there is no way I would switch the key skill. There is already a defensive manouevre based off Initiative. Also I want to make as many skills as possible useful in the system.

But then, if you've already created a solution that achieves what you want, why would you be so keen on me making a carbon copy of it? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Better, no, to have two solutions - one for those who want to raise the power of non-Forcies, and one for those who want to lower the power of Forcies.
Plus, I'm not too keen on the idea of going through all the Force powers in the game and rebalancing them. Far too many of the damned things.

I guess what I wanted to say was "all kinds of damage that weapons can deal out", which includes pretty much all except for Force damage. That was my point, that a Force-user can only fend off energy damage with NE, it does nothing against slugthrowers, most melee weapons, grenades, missile launchers, etc. Combined with reducing CT damage by 1, I think it is way more powerful than NE.

If thatÂ´s the case, then yes, you are right that it is less likely to be abused the same way Skill Focus/Force Powers are. I was under the impression that you were looking to expand this to have a lot of maneuvers for the various skills. I still think that lowering CT damage by 1 is too much though. If nothing else, it really makes taking certain talents seem much less useful, like Devastating Attack, Stunning Strike, Set for Stun, etc...

Yeah, IÂ´d rename it. I think it is a good power, but "rolling with the blow" and Endurance are two separate things, at least in my book. For a new name "Suck it Up" comes to mind.

I guess what I wanted to get across was that I had made something that worked fairly well to emulate one of your two solutions, if you wanted to try it, or possibly look for ideas. But no, it seems like a waste that you should go ahead and do the same thing.
But what I would like to point out is the many, in lack of a better word, strange things that will happen if you raise other skills to similar levels as UtF like youÂ´ve done in some maneuvers here.
**Surgical Presicion** - Need to take down a target from 200 squares distance? DonÂ´t let your professional sniper do it. HeÂ´ll get range penalties and needs to make an attack roll against the targets Reflex Defense. Give the rifle to the doctor instead. He donÂ´t take range penalties (or even nonproficiency penalties), and he needs to make a Treat Injury check (which he naturally has Skill Focus for) against the targets Fortitude Defense.
In the above scenario, the snipers advantage is that the target might lose a few points of his Reflex Defense for being flat-footed, plus that he can deal more damage. However, if they are using say a poison-tipped weapon, damage matters much less than being able to hit, at which the doctor would be fairly superior.
These are things that might be worth considering.

A reasonable point. I might modify the target to "one enemy within point blank range".
And with regard to not taking non-proficiency penalties, though I failed to explicitly call it out anywhere, in my mind you would still suffer those with any weapon attack, regardless of the modifier being applied.

A reasonable point. I might modify the target to "one enemy within point blank range".

I know I said it already, but I think you could find some ideas in the Jedi Academy Training Manual and the Lightsaber Form Powers. Rewritten using their typical format, hereÂ´s how your Roll with the Blow and Surgical Precision maneuvers could look.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Roll with the Blow (Suck it Up)**</span>
Even if you are hit, you can lessen the effects of it. **Time** Reaction (to being damaged by a weapon attack) **Target** You.
**Make an Endurance check**: If your check result equals or exceeds the damage you would have taken, you instead takes only half the damage you would normally have taken, and you reduce the number of steps the attack moves you down the Condition Track by 1.
**Talent(Tough as Nails)**: If you have the Tough as Nails talent, you can take your Second Wind as an immediate reaction.
**Special**: You can spend a Force Point to gain a +10 bonus to your Endurance check.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Surgical Precision**</span>
You know where to hitÂ´em to make it hurt. **Time** Standard **Target** One enemy within range.
**Make a Treat Injury check**: The result of the check determines the effect, if any.
DC 15: You make a single melee or ranged attack against the target. If your attack deals damage to the target, you may treat the targets Damage Threshold as being 1 point lower against this attack.
DC 20: As DC 15, but you may treat the targets Damage Threshold as being 2 points lower.
DC 25: As DC 20, but you may treat the targets Damage Threshold as being 5 points lower.
DC 30: As DC 25, but you may treat the targets Damage Threshold as being 10 points lower.
**Talent(Dastardly Strike)**: If you have the Dastardly Strike talent, you move the target an extra step down the Condition Track if the damage of your attack equals or exceeds the targets Damage Threshold.
**Special**: You can spend a Force Point to make two skill checks to activate this power, making a Knowledge(Life Sciences) check in addition to your Treat Injury check, using the highest as the final result.

Interesting. I'll look into it.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-06-09 12:30:49)

I am still reading, but something crossed my mind and I thought I would ask:
How do these stack with Force Powers? Because they are skill based (with a feat), Jedi have access to them as well. What happens when a Force User takes them, and adds them to his/her collection of powers? While the anti-Jedi in me wants t o restrict them from Force Users, I understand the swiss army knife Jedi image is a prefect fit for these abilities.
So far, by the way, they look cool. I especially like 'Suck It Up." I need to convince my GM to let me have this.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-09 12:38:45)

Since they don't require Force abilities to use, literally anyone can take them. That does include Jedi. In terms of sheer power, though, it probably doesn't help them as it means they can't just focus everything into Use the Force. And with the new lightsaber forms and so on in JATM, there's even less of a reason for them to look elsewhere for features now.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-09 16:48:42)

New versions of the manouevres that function more like the Lightsaber Form powers in JATM:
<span style="font-size: 1.75em;">Manoeuvre List</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Acrobatic Attack</span>
In a series of unpredictable leaps and rolls, you pass an opponent and strike them. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** One target up to 6 squares away from you.
**Make an Acrobatics check and move up to 6 squares.** The result of the check determines the effects of this manoeuvre, if any:
*DC 15â€”*you can move up to 6 squares as though tumbling (see the Acrobatics skill) and may attack a target at the end of your movement. you receive a +1 bonus to your attack roll.
*DC 20â€”*As DC 15, except you receive a +2 bonus to your attack roll.
*DC 15â€”*As DC 15, except you receive a +3 bonus to your attack roll.
**Talent (Lucky Shot):** If you have the Lucky Shot talent, you can spend a Force point to deny your target their dexterity bonus against your attack (though they are not considered flat-footed).
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to tumble through occupied and threatened squares without paying double movement.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Aggressive Stance</span>
You aim blow after blow on the enemy, never letting up. **Time:** Swift action. **Target:** Yourself.
**Make a melee attack roll.** The result of the check determines the effects of this manoeuvre, if any:
*DC 15â€”*Gain a +1 bonus to any attack rolls you make before your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to Reflex Defense for the same duration.
*DC 20â€”*Gain a +2 bonus to any attack rolls you make before your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to Reflex Defense for the same duration.
*DC 25â€”*Gain a +3 bonus to any attack rolls you make before your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to Reflex Defense for the same duration.
**Talent (Draw Fire):** If you have the Draw Fire talent, you may use it as a Free action for as long as you are in Aggressive Stance.
**Special:** You can sustain aggressive stance by spending a swift action each round to do so. Alternatively, you may spend a Destiny point to extend the benefits of aggressive stance for the duration of the encounter, without the Reflex penalty or the need to maintain with swift actions.
When in aggressive stance, you can spend a Force Point to deal +1d6 damage to a target of your melee attack.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Assassinâ€™s Rush </span>
You strike without warning, bearing down on your target before they have time to react. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** One target up to 6 squares away from you.
**Make a Deception check and move up to 6 squares in a line.** The result of the check determines the effects of this manoeuvre, if any:
*DC 25â€”*The target is considered flat-footed, and you may make an attack against them, dealing damage according to the weapon used and benefitting from any features that work against flat-footed foes.
**Talent (Sneak Attack):** If you have the Sneak Attack talent and you fail to meet the Deception DC, you may still deal 1d6 additional damage with your attack.
**Talent (Hidden Movement):** If you have the Hidden Movement talent, you can substitute a Stealth check for the Deception check.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to lower the Deception DC by 5.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Combined Fire</span>
You coordinate your fire with one or more allies. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** One or more targets fired on by an ally.
**Hold your action until an ally makes a ranged attack, then make a ranged attack roll.** The result of the check determines the effects of this manoeuvre, if any:
*DC 15â€”* You are also treated as using the aid another action for your ally, whether or not you successfully beat the targetâ€™s Reflex. Additionally, if your ally's attack hits, they deal 1d6 additional damage.
*You beat the opponent's Reflexâ€”*As DC 15, except the aid another bonus granted by you improves to +4 and your ally deals 2d6 additional damage if they succeed in hitting the opponent.
**Talent (Coordinate):** If you or the ally you are aiding have the Coordinate talent, either of you may use it as an immediate Reaction.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to improve your allyâ€™s damage bonus by an additional die.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Crushing Charge</span>
You charge forward with such force you push your opponents with you. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** special.
**Make a melee attack roll and move up to 6 squares (minimum 2) in a line.** As part of the movement you can move through squares occupied by opponents, though you cannot end your movement in an occupied square. The result of the check is compared to the Reflex Defense of all opponents occupying squares in and adjacent to the line. Each target whose Reflex is equalled or exceeded takes damage according to the weapon used and is knocked prone. If the result is less than a targetâ€™s Reflex Defense, it takes half damage and is not knocked prone. Additionally, a missed target can make an opportunity attack against you. This is an area effect.
**Talent (Melee Smash):** If you have the Melee Smash talent, you double the bonus granted to +2 against targets of your Crushing Charge.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to gain a +5 bonus to Reflex against attacks of opportunity provoked by your charge.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Dodging Defense</span>
***(This manoeuvre replaces the Dodge feat).***
With all the lithe grace of a dancer, you slip past your enemyâ€™s attack. **Time:** Reaction. **Target:** one attack made against you.
**Make an Acrobatics check.** Compare the result to the attack roll of the creature that attacked you. If it equals or exceeds the attack roll, their attack misses.

**Special:** You must be aware of the attack (and not flat-footed) to use this manouevre.
If you spend a Force point, you may apply your Acrobatics roll as a defense against all further weapon or unarmed attacks made against you this round.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Evasive Manoeuvring</span>
***(This manoeuvre replaces the Vehicular Combat feat; it can also be bought as a Starship Manoeuvre).***
While piloting a vehicle, you know how to jink and juke to avoid enemy fire. Time: Reaction. Target: one attack made against you or the vehicle you are piloting.

**Special:** You must be piloting a vehicle and aware of the attack (and not flat-footed) to use this manouevre.
If you spend a Force point, you may apply your Pilot roll as a defense against all further weapon or unarmed attacks made against you or your vehicle this round.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Lightning Strike</span>
Before your target knows whatâ€™s happening, your weapon is drawn and you have made a potentially fatal attack. **Time:** Swift action. **Target:** one enemy within reach or in range.
**Make a Deception check.** The result of the check determines the effect, if any.
*DC 15â€”*You make a single melee or ranged attack against the target. You suffer a -5 penalty to your attack roll, but they are considered flat-footed against you.
*DC 20â€”*As DC 15, but you only suffer a -2 penalty to your attack roll.
*DC 25â€”*As DC 20, but you only suffer a -1 penalty to your attack roll.
*DC 30â€”*As DC 25, but you suffer no penalty to your attack roll.
**Talent (Sneak Attack):** If you have the Sneak Attack talent, you deal an additional 1d6 sneak attack damage when you successfully hit.
**Special:** When you use this manouevre, you may spend a Force point to draw a number of additional weapons equal to the amount of spare hands you possess. You may make no additional attacks as part of this action, however.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Master Grenadier</span>
You can place explosives in such a way to maximise the destruction caused. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** All opponents in the burst area of an explosive thrown by you.
**Make a Demolitions check.** Compare the result to the Reflex Defense of the targets. The result of the check determines the effects of this manoeuvre, if any:
*DC 15â€”*You make a ranged attack against the target or targets using a grenade. You receive a +1 bonus to your attack roll.
*DC 20â€”*As DC 15, but you also deal an additional 1d6 damage.

*DC 20â€”*Gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against melee or ranged weapon attacks made against you until the end of your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to your own attacks for the same duration.
*DC 25â€”*Gain a +3 bonus to all defenses against melee or ranged weapon attacks made against you until the end of your next turn, but take a -1 penalty to your own attacks for the same duration.
**Talent (Acute Senses):** If you the have Acute Senses talent, you may choose to reroll your Perception check on any turn you maintain Ready Stance, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if worse.
**Special:** You can sustain ready stance by spending a swift action each round to do so. Alternatively, you may spend a Destiny point to extend the benefits of ready stance for the duration of the encounter, without the attack penalty or the need to maintain with swift actions.
When in ready stance, you can spend a Force Point to improve your Damage Threshold by 5 against one attack. You may do so after discovering the effects of that attack.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Reflexive Defense</span>
Your instincts are finely honed, causing your body to react to danger before your consciousness is even aware there was a threat. **Time:** Reaction. **Target:** One attack made against you.
**Make an Initiative check.** Compare the result to the attack roll of the creature that attacked you. If it equals or exceeds the attack roll, their attack misses.
**Talent (Uncanny Dodge I):** If you have either Uncanny Dodge talent, you can immediately withdraw up to 2 squares as part of the reaction.
**Special:** You must be aware of the attack (and not flat-footed) to use this manouevre.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Skirmisherâ€™s Withdrawal</span>
You back away from your enemies, taking the opportunity to strike at one of them as you go. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** one enemy within reach at any point during your movement.

**Talent (Improved Initiative):** If you have the Improved Initiative talent, you can use this manouevre as a reaction to being attacked by an opponent. The opponent that attacked you must be the target of your own attack.
**Special:** When you use this manoeuvre, you can spend a Force Point to treat the target as flat-footed if they werenâ€™t already.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Sniperâ€™s Shot</span>
You are a master of precision fire. **Time:** Standard action. **Target:** one enemy within range.
**Make a ranged attack roll.** Reduce the range penalty applied to your attack by one category, or if at point blank range apply a +1 bonus to hit. Compare the result of your check to the Reflex Defense of the target. If the result equals or exceeds their Reflex, deal damage according to your weapon.
**Talent (Sneak Attack):** If you have the Sneak Attack talent, you deal an additional 1d6 damage (whether or not the target qualfiies for your usual Sneak Attack damage).

Sweet work. For those of you looking for advantages of these maneuvers over say Lightsaber Form powers, these maneuvers all grow better by using talents that can be accessed by base classes.

### **Valheru** (2009-06-09 19:05:30)

I especially like the rewrites. However, I have one major concern.
> **Evasive Manoeuvring**

If you spend a destiny point, you may apply your Pilot roll as a defense against all further weapon or unarmed attacks made against you or your vehicle this round. You decide to spend the destiny point after finding out your check result.

I like regular old Vehicular Combat better. Granted you get multiple maneuvers with one feat (assuming you have a Wisdom bonus), but Vehicular Combat can be used once per *round* while this is only usable once per *combat* (unless it gets refreshed, are you using the established rules were you get all your maneuvers back if you roll a 20 while activating one?). The free movement is OK, but not the reason someone would take this maneuver. In fact, why is the movement only usable in a vehicle? In my experience tactical movement is much more important in character combat. Also the Starship Maneuver Snap Roll already lasts for a whole round, while Evasive Maneuver takes a Destiny point to do the same thing. Allowing pilots to use their focused skill to protect themselves outside the cockpit is nice I guess (though perhaps a little odd), but you're actually weakening the pilot when he's in the air. Finally, removing Vehicular Combat as a feat creates some problems. First it's normally a prereq for Starship Tactics, does a pilot have to take this maneuver to get Starship maneuvers? Secondly a pilot will have to take Weapon Pro(Heavy) now, that's not a huge deal but something to consider.
Also, isn't Dodge a prereq for several feats?

All good concerns, and ones that I'm too tired to address right now. The simple answer (which doesn't address the problems, but does at least explain why) is that I dislike Vehicular Combat as written. A lot. It's too good, and can be used too often. If you don't have it in vehicle combat, and go up against someone who does, you are in real trouble. Which means every trained pilot in the combat is going to have it and if you're the one hero who turns up with just half level in pilot, you're in the bantha poodoo. Kind of puts the lie to the "everyone can take part in Saga" line.
As for the tactical movement bit, if you look through the manouevres you'll see at least two that do much the same thing as Evasive Manouevring for characters on foot.
And Dodge just royally sucks.
I'll look at this again tomorrow some time, and suggest some ways to fix the issues that come up when feats are replaced by this system. Right now bed beckons.

You can regain these Combat Manoeuvres in the same ways that Force powers and Starship Manoeuvres get recharged:

* When combat is over and you have a chance to rest for 1 minute, you regain all your combat manoeuvres.

It's a bonus for characters that have Hyperdriven. The movement is only useable in a vehicle because its a manoeuvre that requires you to be piloting a vehicle. For equivalent manoeuvres useable on foot, see Dodging Defense and Reflexive Defense. Also note that the extra movement is intended for vehicles used at character scale, not starship scale, so does have some tactical consequences.

These are actually somewhat different. Let's analyse:

* Snap Roll replaces your Reflex Defense with your Pilot check until the start of your next turn.
* Evasive Manoeuvring negates one attack against you if your Pilot check exceeds the attack roll.

Against the first attack then, they basically do the same thing. However, there is a key difference:

* Snap Roll requires you to activate it before the attack is resolved.
* You activate Evasive Manoeuvring after the attack is resolved, since it depends on you knowing the attack roll.

Tactically, this is quite significant and would make this manoeuvre at least soemwhat attactive even to people who already possess Snap Roll. An additional resource seems a reasonable price to pay to extend the benefits across a round, though I will reduce the cost for this and the other similar manoeuvres to a Force point.

Well, I know I didn't spell it out... But I assumed it was fairly implicit that you had to be on a vehicle to use this manoeuvre?

If you include this manoeuvre (which you don't have to, you could adopt each and every other and ignore this one) change the prerequisites of Starship Tactics to the following:

* Trained in the Pilot Skill, possesses any Spacer talent or the Evasive Manoeuvring combat manoeuvre.

I think it's reasonable. Like I said, Vehicular Combat gives far too much. They also have the option of taking Spacehound (and its a rare pilot who hasn't at least looked at taking some Spacer talents in the first place).

Change the prerequisite for Mobility to:

* Dex 13, trained in Acrobatics or possesses the Acrobatic Attack combat manoeuvre.

Change the prerequisite of Improved Charge to:

* Dex 13, Mobility, trained in Acrobatics or possesses the the Acrobatic Attack combat manoeuvre.

OK that's what I figured, just checking.

Yes I put this quote out of order but it's perhaps the most important. When I first read this maneuver I assumed it was only usable in a vehicle but the line "Target: one attack made against you or the vehicle you are piloting." made me think otherwise. Now, I suppose you must have meant the maneuver can be used to negate an attack that specifically targets you instead of your vehicle *while piloting a vehicle*. This changes quite a lot, I assumed being able to use it in or out of a vehicle was the trade off for being weaker overall.

That's fine, my only problem with the movement stemmed from the fact that I thought this maneuver was usable on foot.

Very true, it's great to be able to use the maneuver after the attack roll is known, it's just that Vehicular Combat already did that. Dropping the "whole round" benefit to a Force point certainly makes it more attractive though.

Well I think the Spacer talents are a waste, but without Vehicular Combat you're gonna want to pick up Evasive Maneuvering so this is not so bad. In fact taking Combat Maneuvers then Starship Tactics puts the pilot ahead a little bit, albeit only outside the cockpit (unless some of your other maneuvers are usable inside a vehicle?).

Yeah not really a problem, just thought I'd mention it. In fact the Spacer talents become more attractive using your alternate rules (particularly OCS) but it's not a bad idea for a pilot to pick up Heavy Weapons anyways.

Looks good, I was just wondering what your intentions were when replacing a feat with a maneuver.
Alright, knowing now that you *want* to weaken Vehicular Combat (even if I don't entirely agree with your reasons), I can see the merits of your replacement. Good work, now I just need to make an app for Ripples in the Deep so I can test some of this stuff out!

None of the others are. However, there's plenty of room to expand the available manoeuvres (though I'd like to playtest as is before I add to it) so some more vehicle-specific ones could be introduced.
