# Design Diary: The Will of the World (Part I)

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-26 19:02:37)

I need to write the next adventure for my tabletop campaign, but am having trouble driving myself to do so. And so I'm posting this here and now, to be updated as an ongoing process. Hopefully the commitment this thread represents and the desire not to look lazy in front of my peers will help me get the job done.
While I'm writing this for my campaign and there are a particular set of circumstances that need to be dealt with, I will endeavour to make the adventure as general as possible. If that fails I'll add notes on how to adapt the adventure to other campaigns. All just in the hope you can get some use out of the material.
You are of course welcome to make comments and suggestions or ask questions during the design process.
As and when sections of the adventure are complete, I will post them to R2D20 - which will make a more suitable article than several posts spread over the entirety of a thread.
**Things I need to take into account:**
[ul][*]The party are 4th level.  
[*]The party Jedi-in-training, the Zabrak Reba, has been absent recently. He went off with NPC Jedi-in-training Eric to the planet Solsis VII, mentioned in the diaries of Eric's mother. The native Hobben (a Zabrak subspecies) have a primitive force tradition, the teachings of which are surprisingly similar to those of the Jedi order in substance. They are there in the hopes of advancing their Jedi training.  
[*]At the end of last session the rest of the party, after just surviving the Battle of Hoth, were on their way to Solsis VII to update the two Jedi on the Rebellion's change in fortunes.  
[*]However, due to being deported for overstaying on his visa (yikes) Reba's player is still unable to be present, so I need to engineer things so that despite arriving on Solsis VII, the two groups don't immediately meet.[/ul]

there are so many things that could happen here, but I think the most likely would be that Reba and the NPC would have had to move on. The empire was relentless in its hunt for jedi, they could have picked up a hunter or they simply went to a secluded area for training.

> they simply went to a secluded area for training.

This was my first thought. The area where Reba and Eric first landed could be nowhere near their present location, and since the planet is heavily forested it maybe impossible to find them any way but on foot.

That and if Reba was is deep meditation he would have no reason to look for the other players right away, though he would sence if they where in trouble.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">The Hobben</span>
Clearly descended from the Zabrak, Hobben manifest many of the same characteristics. They have long since evolved to best manage on their heavily forested world however.
> <span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Hobben Species Traits</span>
> Hobben share the following species traits:
> **Ability Modifiers:** +2 Dexterity. Hobben are agile and quick, easily a match for their world - well, most of them.
> **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Hobben have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
> **Speed:** Hobben base speed is 6 squares.
> **Resistant:** Hobben are resistant and stubborn, and gain a +1 species bonus to their Fortitude and Will saves.
> **Light Sensitivity:** Hobbens prefer the shade and gloom of their undercanopy world. In bright sunlight, they suffer a -1 penalty to all attack rolls and Perception checks.

Hobben organise themselves into tribal groups. In the past, these warred all the time, but the last century or so has been relatively peaceful, and the world has begun to prosper as for the first time travel and trade have become a possibility. Still, the world has its fair share of dangerous predators, and a warrior may find a great deal of work protecting his village, travellers, or going out to slay beasts for valuable meat, skins, and bones.
Each tribe has its own group of shamans, all of whom believe in the concept they call the Ali'La.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Ali&#39;La - The Will of the World</span>
This is the revered shamanistic Force tradition of the Hobben. They believe that the Force is the manifest power of the natural world, and that the Dark Side is a corruption. The beliefs and practices of their shamans are thus near identical to those of the Jedi, though far less refined and with a focus on nature.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">First Contact</span>
The Aliâ€™La was of great interest to Quixis Kolle, the Jedi who discovered it, as she believed its practitioners could easily be re-educated in the ways of the Jedi. Though a far younger tradition, the Aliâ€™La had already evolved into something resembling the practices of the Jedi, and Quixis had few concerns that the Force users of Solsis VII were particularly dangerous to themselves or others, but she hoped to correct the fundamental errors in their beliefs and saw them as a great asset to be incorporated into the Jedi Order. To this end she taught them Jedi lessons, and in turn learned some of their lore.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Rediscovery</span>
When the Jedi Order went to war with the Republic against Separatists, Quixis hoped to convince the Hobben to join the cause, or at least convince them not to join the Separatists if the enemy should discover their presence on Solsis VII. By necessity her arguments became less subtle. The shamans, resistant to change, quickly grew tired of the perceived blasphemies Quixis was speaking against their traditions. She finally outwore her welcome and was asked politely but firmly to leave. This coincided with the timing of Order 66, and she had not yet returned to the Jedi Temple when Obi-Wan and Yoda sent out their warning. She was able to go into hiding in the Outer Rim. After her death, the journals she left behind led her son Eric Nahl to rediscover the Hobben and learn to wield the Force with their shamans along with his companion Reba.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Aliâ€™La Philosophy</span>
To exist is to be one with nature;
Oneâ€™s existence must therefore be the will of nature.
Without will one cannot exist;
Oneâ€™s will must therefore be the will of nature.
Your will is the will of the world;
Your will is therefore always right.
You are but an infinitesimal part of the world;
What is right for you may not be right for the rest of the world.
It is your choice to heal or harm but know you act for the world;
When you act for the world, you must be accountable.
Learn to identify what is will and what is ego;
The greatest sin is to claim oneâ€™s ego as the worldâ€™s will.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Force Tradition</span>
Only a small number of Hobben are Force-sensitive, and those that are are immediately inducted into their tribe's shamancy where they begin the training that will make them invaluable assets - and one day leaders - of their community.
New shamans are tested in the first months of their training, and their personality type is determined.
Force-sensitives who are strong-willed and physically adept are trained in the Hunterâ€™s Will. Hunter-Shamans serve as the warrior-elite of their tribe, leading them in battle and deciding on strategies. Hunter-Shamans train with a signature weapon, a thin short blade known as a "thinblade". This weapon doubles as a badge of office - it has a red and green patterned grip unique to the shamans. Hunter-Shamans undergo minimal training in the ways of the Healerâ€™s Will too, but never become as adept as a Healer-Shaman.
Those who are inclined to caring and thoughtful dispositions are trained in the Healerâ€™s Will. Healer-Shamans serve the tribe as advisors, teachers, and healers. All Healer-Shamans carry a simple (though typically high quality) wooden stave. It is entwined in the middle with blue and green cord, and thus serves as a badge of office. Healer-Shamans undergo minimal training in the ways of the Hunter's Will too, but never become as adept as a Hunter-Shaman.
The most senior of shamans from both groups join the ranks of the Elder Shamans, who form the governing council of the tribe. They have final word on everything from the running of day-to-day life to the acceptance of a potential shaman into training. Elder Shamans abandon the previous patterning of their weapons in favour of black and white.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Force Powers</span>
Shamans can use the Force in many of the ways the Jedi do. Hunter-Shamans excel at physical uses of the Force from making incredible leaps and tumbles to dashing rapidly away and withstanding enormous amounts of pain. Healer-Shamans focus in other fields such as farseeing, force healing, empathy and affecting minds.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Aliâ€™La Talents</span>
*(These are just tentative ideas, and haven't been playtested for balance).* 
**Healerâ€™s Will:** You can reroll Use the Force checks to use Vital Transfer. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.
**Healerâ€™s Stave:** Once per day, you can force an opponent to reroll a successful attack if you are wielding your stave. They suffer a -2 penalty to the roll. You must accept the result of the second roll, even if it is worse for you. You can take this talent multiple times.
**Hunterâ€™s Will:** You can reroll Use the Force checks to use Battle Strike. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.
**Hunterâ€™s Blade:** Once per day, you can reroll a failed attack with your thinblade. You gain a +2 bonus on the roll. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. You can take this talent multiple times.[ul][/ul]

**Design Notes: Working Solsis VII and the Hobben into the campaign.**
As you can see from the First Contact and Rediscovery sections of the Ali'La's profile, I have a strong idea of how this tradition fits into my campaign. The tradition can be very easily divorced of these "facts" and incorporated into your own campaign regardless of era or circumstance. If you run a Rebellion era campaign, a variation on my own method works well - you could even use Eric Nahl and his mother's diaries if you wish (at some point I'll post stats for him over at R2D20).

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Adventure Summary</span>
**Arrival:** The party arrive at Solsis VII and land using the coordinates given to them by Reba and Eric - who first found them in the journals of Quixis Kolle. This lands them on a plateau surrounding by veritable seas of woodland, and not too far from a range of inhospitable looking mountains to the West. The *Screaming Siren* is also atop the plateau, proving that Reba and Eric are here... somewhere.
**Contact:** There are no further clues as to the two jedi's location, but they're certainly not here. Whether the group stays where they are or decides to go searching, they will eventually be intercepted by a group of Hobben from the nearby village. Most speak a variation of Zabrak, but their leader, a venerable Elder Shaman, has learned rudimentary basic from Quixis Kolle.
**Proof:** The heroes will somehow have to prove they are friends of Reba and Eric to get any help from the Hobben. If they do, they are told that the two jedi are away for training with the Hunter-Shamans, beyond the mountains to the West. They are invited to the Hobben's village.
*Skill Check:* Climb, to descend the sometimes treacherous plateau.
**Welcome:** The heroes are treated as curiosities by the villagers. A feast is held in their honour. If they didn't convince the Elder Shaman well enough of their good intentions, they will be drugged (Perception check to notice) and made prisoner at this time. Otherwise, they are treated as befits honoured guests. The rest of this summary assumes the latter - I'll add a second detailing changes made if the former occurs.
**Expedition:** In the morning a pair of Hobben guides (One a Hunter-Shaman, the other a Healer-Shaman) are assigned to escort the group to their friends. Their able guidance might not be enough to save the PCs from the many dangers of the forest, however...
*Skill Check:* Survival to avoid some of the natural hazards, such as boggy ground and strangling vines. The Hobbens set a hard pace, and Endurance checks may also be in order.
**Sun in Shade:** The group are attacked by Sun Bugs, large predatory insects that fly above the canopy collecting ambient light in their carapace, only to swoop down on prey below - the light helping to dazzle creatures used to the shade.
**Camp:** At the base of the mountains, night falls and the group sets up camp. Watches are set to protect against night predators.
*Skill Check:* Perception checks while the group are sleeping - if they succeed at a DC 20 check, they wake up to the sounds of one of their Hobben guides being dragged off by a night predator.
**Pass:** In the morning, the remaining guide (assuming he didn't die during the adventures of yesterday) does not want to continue.
*Skill Check:* A Persuasion check opposed to his Will Defense convinces him, otherwise he returns to the village even if the PCs continue to climb the mountain pass.
*Skill Check:* Climb checks may be needed at times, and possibly even Jump checks (depending on how cruel I feel).
**Zombies:** On the other side of the pass, the PCs stumble upon a blackpowder plant and blackpowder zombies - Mostly Hobbens, and one . If their guide is still with them, he recognises the zombies as members of the group of Hunters who escorted Eric and Reba.
*Skill Check:* A DC 10 Survival check finds a trail that leads to the Hunter-Shaman camp.
**Tragedy:** The camp is in ruins, butchered corpses lying where they fell. Reba and Eric are not among them.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Beast: Sun Bug</span> (CL 4)
The average Sun Bug is 3.6 metres long and is about 1.8 metres high, and resembles closely a beetle from the *Coccinellidae* family (such as a ladybird). Its carapace is a pearlescent beige in its natural state. These voracious predators fly above the canopies of Solsis VII soaking up ambient sunlight into their wing covers, then dive down on potential prey from above, releasing the energy in dazzling flares from their carapace.
A Sun Bug is quite capable of killing a human or like-sized creature, and have occasionally been known to carry smaller creatures into the air still struggling.
Sun Bugs occasionally hunt alone, but are most often found in groups of three or more. They always hunt during the daytime, and will not be encountered at nighttime unless their nest is disturbed.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Hazard: Strangling Vine</span> (CL 3)
Though not sentient or mobile enough to be called creatures and make use of the Beast class, some of the plantlife on Solsis VII can be somewhat... fiesty. Chief among these is the strangling vine, a large cord-like climbing plant that senses by vibrations the approach of prey and drops on them from above. It then tightens until they stop struggling, injecting them with poisons to assist the process by means of thousands of tiny thorns, then sucks them dry for sustenance. A single strangling vine is very long, and can attack whole parties at the same time until killed. Occasionally, in areas with large amounts of prey such as near water, multiple strangling vines grow together, and these are particularly lethal.
A strangling vine has the following trained skills: Initiative +7, Perception +5, and is considered to have the following feats: Pin, Trip, and Crush. It is equipped with darkvision (page 257 of the SECR core rulebook) and makes one attack per round against the closest target (they don't need to be within its line of sight). Make an grapple roll (1d20+5) against the target's Reflex defense. If the attack succeeds, the target takes 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage (from Crush), and the vine injects the target with a poison with an equivalent effect to Knockout Drops (see page 255 of the SECR core rulebook). The vine has a Reflex defense of 9, a DR of 5, a Damage Threshold of 20, and 8 hit points.

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-29 21:07:37)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Hazard: Darkpowder Plant</span> (CL 4)
Like the Strangling Vine, the Darkpowder Plant is a deadly predator that feeds on the creatures of Solsis VII. However, it does not feed on the living, instead deriving sustenance from decomposing corpses. In order to bring its food to it, the darkpowder plant creates zombie-like servitors using the black, hypnotically suggestive pollen that gives it its name.
A darkpowder plant has the following trained skills: Initiative +5, Perception +7. It is equipped with darkvision (page 257 of the SECR core rulebook) and makes a single action per round. It may either feed on a corpse, or release its pollen as an attack (1d20+5) that targets all creatures within a 15 metre radius area. If the target's Fortitude Defense is exceeded, it moves -1 step along the condition track. An affected creature is subject to further attacks each round until it either successfully resists or reaches the end of its condition track; if the end of the track is reached the target does not fall unconscious, but instead becomes trapped in its mind by severe hallucinations that make it the mindless servitor of the darkpowder plant. The darkpowder plant has a DR of 5, 10 hit points, and a Damage Threshold of 20.
Recovery from the madness of the darkpowder plant's pollen requires a DC 20 Treat Injury [Treat Poison] check. The DC can be reduced to 15 with the aid of an infusion created from a variety of Solsis VII plants; this fact is known only to the Hobben. Killing the darkpowder plant does not cure the madness; without the commands of the plant, the victim remains deadly still until death or a cure frees them.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Darkpowder Zombie</span>
A darkpowder zombie is a living creature that has fallen victim to the pollen of a darkpowder plant. It is used to defend the plant, but may also roam where the plant and its pollen cannot reach, traveling far afield to hunt and kill other creatures then bring their corpse back for the darkpowder plant to feed on.
The darkpowder zombie retains all of its previous stats, but becomes an NPC until cured. It is capable of using all of its abilities in the service of its master, the darkpowder plant.

I do now. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> This write-up assumes that Solsis VII is undiscovered and therefore not incorporated into galactic society. Among other things, that means there are no Knowledge [Galactic Lore] or Knowledge [Social Sciences] checks.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Solsis VII</span>
**Region:** Outer Rim
**Climate:** Temperate
**Gravity:** Standard
**Moons:** 3
**Length of Day:** 25 standard hours
**Length of Year:** 326 local days
**Sapient Species:** 100% Hobben (native)
**Government:** Shaman councils
**Capital:** None
**Major Exports:** None
**Major Imports:** None
Solsis VII is a heavily forested world, inhabited only by the Hobben (descended from early Zabrak settlers) and a rich array of wildlife and plantlife, much of which is deadly. Its Hobben natives are extremely primitive by Galactic standards (presumably, the technologies of the Zabrak settlers have been lost), living off the land as hunters and farmers, and forging tools of iron in smithies.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Session 8: The Will of the World (Part I)</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Arrival on Solsis VII</span>
> The *Queen Quixis* drops out of hyperspace in the Solsis System, between the 7th planet and one of its three moons.
> &#39;This is it.&#39; Captain Andren Nahl says, gesturing at the view. &#39;The astrogation coordinates my son gave you lead to this planet.&#39;
> He takes the ship into Solsis VII&#39;s atmosphere, descending to the heavily canopied surface. As the transport gets lower a high plateau becomes visible rising above the treeline. The *Screaming Siren* can be seen atop it. To the west of the plateau, a range of inhospitable looking mountains sprouts tower above the green carpet.
> Captain Andren reduces the *Queen&#39;s* speed, circling the plateau and bringing the transport in to land nearby to the *Siren*.

Eric and Reba are not on the *Screaming Siren*, though all of the group's equipment (such as their swoops) is still onboard.
If the group stays on the plateau, they are found by a Hobben welcoming party after a few standard hours. If they climb down, they must succeed at DC 15 Climb checks to descend the often treacherous plateau. There is no trail to follow at the bottom, and if the PCs go wandering they may encounter a predator or natural hazard (see the appendix at the end of this adventure for potential opponents and hazards, or use statistics from another source). After an hour or so, the Hobben welcoming party manages to track them down.
*Make a secret Perception check against a DC of 16 for every PC to avoid being surprised.*
> From all around, Zabrak appear. They are unusual for their race, having a chalky blue skin colour and noticeably dilated irises. They are equipped primitively, with bows, spears, and leather armour. Most notable among them is an aged male with a long silver mane. Unlike the others he carries only a thin shortblade with a black and white patterned grip thrust through the belt at his waist.
> He speaks, haltingly and imperfectly, in the basic tongue.
> &#39;Who are be, offworlders?&#39;

The leader of the party is Galaa Ayah of the Inlu'la Tribe, a member of the tribe's Elder Council. He is suspicious of the PCs and their motives for being on Solsis VII - if they mention Reba and Eric he doesn't automatically assume that they are friends, but instead requires convincing of that fact.
The three possible resolutions to this encounter are as follows:
[ul][*]**The PCs don't mention Reba and Eric:** They are taken to the Inlu'la village as guests.  
[*]**The PCs mention Reba and Eric and fail to convince Galaa Ayah they are friends:** They are taken to the Inlu'la village as prisoners. If they resist, the Hobbens will attempt to subdue them.  
[*]  
[*]**The PCs mention Reba and Eric and convince Galaa Ayah they are friends:** They are taken to the Inlu'la village as honoured guests.[/ul]It should be noted that the line between "guest" and "prisoner" is a thin one though the distinction is important: the honour of the Hobben demands that they treat any stranger in their village well, even a prisoner. By the other token, even a potential friend isn't unduly trusted and will be kept under watch.  
When the PCs are taken to the nearby village (they and their Hobben escort must make DC 15 Climb checks if they are descending the plateau), it requires a walk of several hours through the verdant forest and gives the PCs a taste of the massive variety of natural life on the planet.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Session 8: The Will of the World (Part I)</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Inlu&#39;la Village</span>
> The village of the Inlu&#39;la tribe emphasises the primitive nature of the culture on Solsis VII. Most of the houses are constructed of wood - an overly abundant resource on this planet - with only a few even incorporating stone. It is certainly a far cry from the metal and permacrete constructions found in more civilised parts of the Galaxy. In the centre of the village are the businesses, where workers go about their business in workshops open to the street outside their houses - You pass a carpenter planing a wheel intended for a small cart, and a blacksmith hammering iron into the shape of a pan. The native Hobben, particularly the children who have little to entertain them, watch you pass with undisguised curiousity. The adults expressions are mingled in many cases with open distrust and even fear, while the children behave with obvious excitement, attempting to follow the group through the village and get closer to you until they are shooed away by your escort at Galaa Ayah&#39;s orders.

Galaa Ayah takes the PCs to a large building in the very middle of the village, where they are led into the single room within and see the three other Hobben sitting inside. Like Galaa Ayah, they are all past their prime, but comport themselves with the pride and dignity of those used to control. All of their weapons bear the black and white pattern previously seen on Galaa Ayah's thinblade - A woman bears a similar blade, while the two men present sit with staves across their knees.
The PCs have been brought to see the Elder Council, where they have a chance to restate their purpose on Solsis VII (and therefore a chance to convince the Hobbens of their good intentions if they previously failed). All but one of the Healer-Shamans understand Basic: while they talk, Galaa Ayah will continually translate. If the PCs try to be too eloquent for the Hobbens' limited vocabulary to keep up, this may result in some mis-communications.
If the PCs still fail to convince, they are taken to an empty house and kept under guard. They will have to think of a way to persuade the Hobbens, or alternatively to escape. *The adventure continues under the assumption that they were successful in their persuasion attempts.*
Once they are determined to be friends, it is explained to the PCs that Eric and Reba went with a group of Hunter-Shamans beyond the Western mountains to train. They will be guided there in the morning, but for now the PCs are guests of honour at a feast held in the village square. The dishes on offer are delicious, provided one doesn't ask where they came from or think about their shape and colour too much. The drink, some kind of fermented berry juice, is sweet and refreshing, and makes you feel increasingly light-headed.
> After a night of revelry, you wake up surprisingly well-rested. Whatever drink the Hobben were giving you, it delivered dizzying highs without any apparent morning side-effects.

At this point you should make an attack against each PC's Fortitude Defense (1d20+5). If any fail, read the following:
> It is only as you stand that you feel anything wrong. It feels like having a lead weight in your stomach, around which a snake is squirming. You dash for the latrine in a desperate race to purge the rumbling mess from your bowels before it escapes of its own accord. You have never felt more uncomfortable or panicked in your life.
> When you leave the house, finally settled but looking notably white and drawn, the Hobben waiting for you outside laugh in recognition of your plight.
> &#39;It is like that if used to it not.&#39; The woman says, beaming toothily, while her male companion guffaws.

Inyu Yaana (the woman, a Healer-Shaman) and Eiran Boreh (the man, a Hunter-Shaman) are here to be the PC's escort. Only Inyu speaks Basic. When the PCs are ready, they lead them out of the village and along a worn trail through the forest. Soon enough, the trail disappears altogether.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Session 8: The Will of the World (Part I)</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Braving the Forest</span>
> Your Hobben guides lead you through the forest with a confidence that could only come from being a native. Determining direction is hard enough, as breaks in the canopy through which to observe the position of the suns and the mountains you travel towards are few and far between, but they also recognise signs of dangerous hazards and predators unique to the planet that you would likely have missed.
> Several hours into the journey, the ground underneath your feet becomes increasingly boggy. Eiran Boreh walks at the fore of your group, testing cautiously for footings. Your speed is dramatically reduced accordingly, and when you stop for a meal around midday you have yet to regain solid ground. You sit on a patch of raised earth eating cold leftovers from the last night&#39;s feast. The food is somewhat less appetising in the light of day, but is at least filling.
> Part-way through the meal, a low buzzing becomes audible. Inyu Yaana and Eiran Boreh freeze, fear evident in their expression, then drop their food and grab their weapons.
> &#39;Be still.&#39; Inyu urges, looking upwards towards the canopy in trepidation.

**Combat Encounter: Sun Bugs in the Bog**
The buzzing noise is being generated by a pack of four Sun Bugs flying overhead. Inyu's urging has come too late as they have sensed the presence of potential prey.
Throughout the encounter, the PCs, NPCs, and any Sun Bug who lands will have to deal with the conditions of the bog.
> The buzzing gets louder, then the creatures generating it crash through the branches overhead. Large beetles with pearlescent beige carapaces, they descend on you with frightening speed. As you watch their carapaces suddenly flare with energy, bathing them in a dazzling corona of light that makes you see spots.

With the fight over, and the group recovered as best as it can, the Hobben guide the PCs further, out of the bog and through the forest to the base of the mountains just in time for night fall. A camp is set and watches organised - the Hobben, used to such duties, take the middle watches so the PCs can get uninterrupted sleep.
*Make secret Perception checks (DC 20). If any of the group pass, they are woken during the night.*
> You start awake, sure you heard a muffled cry. Your bleariness falls away to be replaced with cold dread when you suddenly hear the start of a scream that is just as suddenly cut off. It is followed by a thud and then the sound of something being dragged off into the forest.

One of their guides has been killed and dragged off by a night predator - if both are still with them, it is Eiran; if either was previously killed during the encounter with the Sun Bugs, it is the remaining one.
The remaining guide (if any) falls victim to fear at this point, and tries to convince the PCs (verbally or non-verbally, depending on whether they can communicate) to turn back with them. *A persuasion check opposed by the Hobben's Will defense convinces them to carry on, otherwise they return with or without the PCs.*

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-02 11:46:28)

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Hazard: Boggy Ground</span> (CL 3)
The ground is uneven, soft, and water-logged. Movement in the area is halved, and any movement-based skill check attempted in the bog has its DC increased by 5.
If a character spends even a single round on boggy ground without moving, make an attack roll (1d20+5) against its Reflex defense (unmodified by any armor). If its defense is beaten, the creature begins to sink and gets stuck. If the creature's defense is unbeaten it is safe this round, but for each subsequent round it fails to move the attack roll is increased by +5.
Further attacks are made against the sinking creature each round. Each attack that successfully beats the creature's Reflex defense moves it one step along the condition track. If they are knocked to the bottom of the track they are fully swallowed by the bog. A full-round action and a strength check against a DC of 15 are required to break free.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Session 8: The Will of the World (Part I)</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Mountain Pass</span>
> This close, the jagged mountains are even more imposing. The earth below your feet has given way to dark rock, on which a trail - little more than a groove - has been worn winding up the mountainside.
> The further up the mountain you get, the steeper the path, and the trees of the forest become gradually sparser until finally you are exposed to the elements, sunlight beating down upon your backs. Up here is the easiest pass through the mountains, though it is difficult to believe that considering the challenge of the climb you can see ahead of you.

*Climb checks are in order here - as many as is entertaining against a DC of 15. If you feel particularly cruel, you can require Jump checks to cross certain places where the path has fallen away. If the PCs still have a guide with them, that guide has brought rope and climbing gear. Otherwise they are wholly reliant on themselves and their own equipment if they have any.*
The group will have to camp in the mountains. Provided they don't draw undue attention to themselves, they are safe from predators during the night.
In the morning, they reach the top and start down the other side, a somewhat easier journey. *Climb checks may again be required, but against a DC of 10.*
> As the incline of the mountainside begins to level underneath you, you find yourself moving back into the forest and under the protection of the canopy. Here you see the first signs of the Hunter-Shamans you&#39;re looking for - a fire pit, lined with stones. Nearby a spring bubbles up from the ground, and you stop briefly to quench your thirst. The water is icy and extremely refreshing, and it is easy in this beautiful, shaded place to appreciate the beauty of Solsis VII regardless of the planet&#39;s dangers.

*Make secret Perception checks (DC 15) on behalf of the PCs. If any pass, read the following:*
> It dawns on you that despite being within the forest for almost half an hour now, you haven&#39;t heard or seen any signs of wildlife.

**Combat Encounter:** The wildlife have avoided this area ever since a Blackpowder plant grew here. When the PCs move further into the forest, they stumble across it and the zombies guarding it - three Hobben Hunter-Shamans.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Session 8: The Will of the World (Part I)</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Destination Disaster</span>
> The camp is finally found in a large clearing, open to the skies, but isn&#39;t the active and lively place expected. Instead, it is deadly still and you quickly observe the signs: several of the tents are collapsed, and the ground is churned as though by frenzied activity. Your roving eyes pass over a small mound of earth under the shadow of a tent, from which protrudes the bladed portion of a broken spear. As it draws your attention and details become focused, it turns out not to be a mound at all, but a body.
> The corpse is that of a Hobben, and it isn&#39;t the only one. There has been a bloody battle here, and there are no survivors in sight.

Closer inspection of the camp reveals only the bodies of Hobben - some dressed in the manner favoured by those of the Inlu'la village, in shades of brown and red. Others wear blackened armour, clearly from another village. Most importantly, Reba and Eric are not in the camp - alive or dead.
They have been captured, and taken to the village of the Aeng'la...

And the complete adventure is now [posted at R2D20](http://saga.wetpaint.com/page/simplyscribed+%7C+Saga+%7C+The+Will+of+the+World+%28Part+I%29 "http://saga.wetpaint.com/page/simplyscribed+%7C+Saga+%7C+The+Will+of+the+World+%28Part+I%29").
Actually, I recommend reading it over there - it's all in the correct order, minus any commentary, and has had some minor but important edits I made while inputting each section.
Feedback is still welcome - even more so, in fact. Now it's done I'll run it soon, so critique now will prevent problems in play.

A few thoughts on what I have read:
Quixis Kolle
-who is this, would like to see a right up on this character could be interesting.
son Eric Nahl
-who is he, same deal.
New shamans are tested in the first months
-a test for new shamans could be a boda style test objects are placed in front of the tested one object is tainted with the force. Just a thought.
-you may want to consider putting your adventure on PDF it would be a great resource for this site and R2D20

I plan to write up Eric for R2D20. I hadn't the same plans for his mother since I wouldn't benefit from the exercise - by the time of my campaign, she is dead. Her story will be touched upon in Eric's background however.

Interesting thought.

> &lt;!&ndash; s:D &ndash;&gt;![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s:D &ndash;&gt;

I will do so at some point in the near future.

with Quixis Kolle
I was mostly interested in how she survied order 66, and for how long. I can wait for her sons backstory <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

She survived because at the time she was on Solsis VII trying to convert the Ali'la Shamans to the ways of the Jedi. The Hobben finally got tired of her preaching seeing it as a slur against their own faith, and finally asked her politely but firmly to leave. She was on her way back to Coruscant when Obi-Wan and Yoda's signal went out, and she was able to go into hiding. She got involved with a trader, Andren Nahl, because moving around constantly helped her evade any who might hunt her. They eventually married, and Eric was born 15 years BBY, though in a (deliberate) parallel to the birth of the Skywalker twins, Quixis died in childbirth.
I have a lot of Eric's future mapped out in general terms and he is intended in some ways to be Luke's opposite. He never joins Luke's academy (an easy way of avoiding that question of "So where was he?", too) because he disagrees with a great deal of Luke's choices.
I'm still waiting on a game where I will be allowed to play Eric and follow his story arc... In the meantime, NPC appearances are about the best I've managed. In this case, including him in the game gave the PC jedi an equal to train with, and the discovery of the Hobben in Eric's mother's diaries was a convenient way of getting Reba out of the campaign while his player was (is) back in Mexico.
