A Houserule for dealing with *those people* who pick no destiny <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
> **Always in Motion**
> If a player does not decide upon or possess a particular Destiny, they may retain limited use of their Destiny Points. Spending a Destiny Point in this manner does not take an action and grants one of the following benefits:
> Automatically cause an attack that deals fatal damage against you to miss.
> Take damage that would otherwise be fatal to another character within your reach.
> Immediately gain 3 Force Points in a hopeless situation (GM approval).
> The character may not use Destiny points to activate any ability that requires a Destiny Point to use or improve the effect of any ability.
> A character whose Destiny is Always in Motion is eligible for Noble Sacrifice or Vengeance under Death and Destiny.
> When the Character gains a Destiny the player should be informed that their Destiny is unlocked and Always in Motion is exchanged for the given Destiny.

Any thoughts on this?

So then this "Always in Motion." is the default state a character is in? For those that pick a Destiny they would then have that Destiny, otherwise they have this until they pick?
Seems interesting though it would seem that this would simply prolong the choice, possibly without end, if the current alternative is no benifits whatsoever until they chose a Destiny.

Hm. Pretty much, though I wasn't thinking about it from the Player's view.
more like the GM at some stage of a campaign thinking *Oh hey, here's a part that could use a player. I'll give this sucker the nasty responsibility* - "Hey you! you has a destiny now. Enjoy!"

I think it is a little too restrictive for the cases when players don´t choose destinies, or for that matter, when the GM don´t want to use destiny rules (but still uses DPs). It is especially debilitating for Force users in such campaigns, as it renders Unleashed powers useless, and cripples many Force Secrets.

Should I insert "optional" somewhere in there?
This is directed at situations where destinies are being used in a game, but not everyone has destinies or says 'any' and/or the GM doesn't have a particular one for them right off the bat.
