# Jedi Investigator PrC

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-18 11:23:14)

This is something I have been missing from the rules. It is basically a jedi class focusing not so much on combat as infiltration and perception. A "detective" jedi of sorts, a bit like Kenobi or Katarn. At first, I just made up the talent tree, but I couldnÂ´t really decide where to put it. So even though Saga does not seem to favor a large number of PrCs, I give you this:
**Jedi Investigator Prestige Class** 
The title of Jedi Investigator is associated with Jedi who were experienced at acting independently to investigate and uncover hidden threats and follwing mysterious clues to their source. They where oftenly assigned these missions by the Jedi Council, and only members of the council would know the nature of their missions. Obi-Wan Kenobis mission to track down Jango Fett is an good example of the kind of missions an investigator would be assigned. While not being a formal assignment within the order, some jedi proved themselves more adept at this kind of work, such as mercenary Kyle Katarn or former EmperorÂ´s Hand Mara Jade Skywalker. There also existed a small number of investigators that devoted themselves to focus their attention on threats that revolved around the dark side, known as Jedi Shadows.
Examples of Jedi Investigators in Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Kyle Katarn, Mara Jade Skywalker, Jaden Korr
Examples of Jedi Shadows in Star Wars: Dace Diath, Maw
**Requirements**
Base Attack Bonus: +7
Trained Skills: Use the Force, Gather Information

I'm always bad when I try to created a new talent tree or PrC.
I like the idea, and although you can make an investigative Jedi with out this class I like the fact that you have made a specialized talent tree.
Balanced talents, feats, force techniques, force powers, and force secrets are about the hardest thing to create.
The prerequisites, hit points, force points, defense bonuses all seem to be good.
I would add one trained skill prerequisite: Gather Information.
That would cover the investigative and perception areas.
You might think of offering **Stealth** as a class skill, in case someone wants to pick it up. Investigators do a lot of sneaking around. Also the fact that you allow access the the Scouts Camouflage Tree you need the skill.
The Jedi Investigator Talent Tree
Force Camouflage - It says you gain concealment. You should describe this concealment and how it can be penetrated. Can someone use a perception check to see you, or hear you. Can you be noticed with sense surroundings and other methods of detection such as scent or tremor sense. I get what your trying to do here, and it looks good.
Danger Sense - Every time I read this it tangles my mind. It sounds like you can use your UtF check to re roll any failed surprise round encounter. Which works nicely.
Force Tracking - Good. Might change the name to Force Intuition or something. I thought it was going to be like the Track feat.
I think you should give a little more access with the Talents. You didn't list any Jedi Talent Tree's like the lightsaber combat talent tree or maybe the Jedi consular talent tree. Training to be an investigator shouldn't prevent you from these trees. That's my opinion, they both compliment the concept.
Overall, nicely put together.

thanks for the input. some of the things you mentioned were things I thought about but decided against.
Gather Information as a skill was something I considered but dropped. It is very appropriate, and it was something I probably dropped simply beacuse Obi-Wan didnÂ´t have it in his stats... :P ...but then of course heÂ´d need a rewrite anyway with this class introduced, so IÂ´ll put it in there
I though about the Stealth skill as well. It is something very useful to an investigator, but not one of their focuses. And since nothing in the camouflage tree actually requires you to be trained in Stealth, I figured just having some of those talens + their untrained skill modifier + Force Camouflage would suffice. Also Saga PrCs doesnÂ´t seem to generally give acess to new skills. Still when I add Gather Info to the requirement list, anyone that can acess this class likely has acess to Stealth anyway
As for the talents, I didnÂ´t write a flavor text for any of them, but the kind of effect Force Camouflage has is something like "Using the Force to subtly manipulate others perceptions", to quote from a near-identic talent from [here](http://www.saga-edition.com/prestige-class/jedi-watchman.php "http://www.saga-edition.com/prestige-class/jedi-watchman.php")
As for Danger Sense I tried to give a little uniqeness as opposed to SagaÂ´s general "reroll" talents. It can be really useful for a character that has a far greater UtF modifier than in the other skills, that arenÂ´t trained in either of the other skill, etc
Force Intuition is taken :P but that was my first choice too. How about Force Guidance?
Saga Prestige classes in general seems to favor three talent trees, that was the reason Lightsaber Combat didnÂ´t make it in.

Force Guidance, sounds good. Force Vestige, that's a synonym of track.
Regarding Danger Sense, what about this:
Danger Sense, you can roll your sense surroundings as a reaction to a surprise. Make a UtF check DC 15, to sense hostile targets in cover, DC 20 to sense targets in total cover. You could even adopt the star wars miniature name, Force Anticipation.
The Jedi knight has 4 talent trees, so it wouldn't be unreasonable.

This is a good one, but I think IÂ´ll stick with the version I originally came up with because it gives you the option to react to the situation as well as being aware of it. If you get to act first in a started combat, youÂ´ll likely make a Sense Surroundings check if needed as the first thing you do anyway.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-19 01:56:35)

I meant to put that if you succeed that you are not surprise, that was what I was implying. It would be really hard to fail this which makes it very useful and dependable.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-19 09:39:38)

I agree with that, and the mechanic you are suggesting is actually the way IÂ´d preferred the Force Technique Imp. Sense Surroundings worked.
But the reason IÂ´m sticking with my version is that it allows you to actually respond to the situation, not just be aware of it. By allowing you to use the UtF result to substitue either your Perception or Initiative result, it acts as a safeguard against poor rolls (you have one more chance to get a good roll), aids if you arenÂ´t trained in one or both of the skills, and also gived you a chance to meet a new threat with a ready Force Suite (given the chance to roll a nat 20 UtF check).
Say you roll a 2 and 5 on Perception and Initiative respectively, but a 19 on Use the Force. Now you have a choice:
will you use the good UtF roll to help you be aware of the situation (as in using it to aid Perception to avoid suprise, could be be worthwhile if you suspect there are baddies trying to jump you with Dastardly Strike, Sneak Attack, etc)
or will you use it to help you react to the situation once it presents itself (as in using it to boost your position in the initiative chain, could be useful if you suspect there will be a long fight, or if you feel thereÂ´s no immediate danger in being surprised).
and if only one of the rolls comes up a bad one, then the use is obvious

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-20 05:23:28)

I get what your saying, that's cool.
I guess to make it more like what you want, you would have to add another sentence to my version.
add "If your UtF check for sense surroundings succeeds your initiative is a natural 20."
Or maybe if you want them to go first then just say that the initiative equals the highest initiative and always reacts before the highest initiate at the beginning of the round that sense surroundings was used.
Anyways, I like your version. I was just trying to take a different angle with less dice rolling.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-20 06:18:49)

I know Saga is about as few dice rolls as possible, but I figured one roll wouldnÂ´t hurt, especially as itÂ´s done simultaneuosly with Per/Init at the beginning of combat.
that being said, I really liked that last suggestion you made <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I have been thinking about it, and given the requirements, most Investigators will likely be using this talent for Initiative anyway, as theyÂ´ll be trained in Perception or have Force Perception. So IÂ´m changing it now to the ideas you have suggested, with the option to spend a Force Point to always go first. Also I will say rather than a "natural 20", that you "takes 20", or something, otherwise, youÂ´d actually get all Force Powers back at the beginning of every combat (small issue as youÂ´ll likely have them all anyway)

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-21 05:27:31)

Oh ya I forgot about that little detail, better reword it or every Jedi will go Investigator.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-21 05:52:12)

well it would only apply to those who have Force Intuition, but still. Now everyone actually have to roll for the nat 20 UtF check

---

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-26 10:51:36)

Okay, I'm slow here...
But, you know... since I was just evaluating Kalaria in the 'Legacy' game, looking at this class is somewhat appealing.
Sure, she is a tech investigator, but if she can roll Use Computers for Gather Info checks... and this class would allow the swap-out, you could have some really interesting fun in this in a completely different direction.
After all, the Jedi did not shun technology, they used it as much as everyone else. And there HAD to be some Jedi with knacks for it in their ranks...
Just a faintly different variant that I find appealing! Sorry.
Just putting in some random comments, I suppose.

thatÂ´s a good thought, but I donÂ´t think I would allow swap of Gather Information and Use Computer in the prereqs. It has more to do with the flavor aspects of this class, but I think itÂ´s important. Still you could just simply take training in GI but no more and then focus fully on computers.

---

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-29 12:19:08)

It wasn't a swap of the Prereqs.
The 'Trace' talent in the Slicer Talent Tree, allows a character to use their Use Computers skill in place of Gather Information.
I was talking about how that could possibly interact with the 'Force Guidance' from the class talent tree.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-29 15:01:04)

ah, my bad

THere are also some talent trees on the SAGAconversions website, google iot if you haven't found it yet, they have some good stuff..

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-17 15:50:55)

IÂ´ve checked it out. Liked some of it, like the aliens and the veichles/equipment conversions. Liked some of it less, like most of the PrCs.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 16:21:58)

I would like to direct you all here:
<!-- m -->[http://sagaconversions.mattylee.com/](http://sagaconversions.mattylee.com/ "http://sagaconversions.mattylee.com/")<!-- m -->
There are some nice (Noooice!) things for Saga, including conversions of the races from the RCR Era aliens book, and some prestige classes. Including a Jedi Watchman PrC which might do what you're wanting yours to do.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-17 16:45:40)

That class was one of the things I liked the least about that site. It does not do what I want the Investigator to do, and IMO it isnÂ´t a very good representation of what a Watchman is. That class describes more what a Jedi Shadow is to me. And a Jedi Shadow can be represented by using this class in combination with a few Jedi Sentinel talents.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-12-17 18:32:29)

Fair enough. But some of the other stuff is still good.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-12-18 00:00:34)

yeah. Like I said, I really likes all the alien conversions, and the veichles and the equipment as well.
