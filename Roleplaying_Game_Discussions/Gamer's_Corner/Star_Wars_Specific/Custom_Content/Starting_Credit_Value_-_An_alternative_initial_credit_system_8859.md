# Starting Credit Value - An alternative initial credit system

### **simplyscribed** (2008-03-24 12:06:33)

This is the Starting Credit Value (or SCV) system I created for use in my game ***Fell Legacy***, expanded to all twenty levels. Yeah, it works just as well for 1st level characters as it does for higher level PCs. I present it in the hope you will find it worth using or adapting for your own games.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Determining SCV</span>
For every heroic level your character has in one of the following classes, you receive one instance of the credit value attached to that class *for that heroic level*. So, if you were creating a 20th level character, six of your credit values would come from the 1st-6th level category, five from the 7th-11th level category, four from the 12th-15th level category, three from the 16th-18th level category, and two from the 19th-20th level category.
[ul]
[*]1st-6th Level[ul]  
[*]**Jedi:** 1,200  
[*]**Noble:** 4,800  
[*]**Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier:** 3,000[/ul]  
[*]7th-11th Level[ul]  
[*]**Jedi:** 2,400  
[*]**Noble:** 9,600  
[*]**Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier:** 6,000[/ul]  
[*]12th-15th Level[ul]  
[*]**Jedi:** 4,800  
[*]**Noble:** 19,200  
[*]**Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier:** 12,000[/ul]  
[*]16th-18th Level[ul]  
[*]**Jedi:** 9,600  
[*]**Noble:** 38,400  
[*]**Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier:** 24,000[/ul]  
[*]19th-20th Level[ul]  
[*]**Jedi:** 19,200  
[*]**Noble:** 76,800  
[*]**Scoundrel/Scout/Soldier:** 48,000[/ul][/ul]  
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Examples</span>**
A **Jedi 6** has an SCV of 7,200 (1,200Ã—6).
A **Soldier 3/Noble 3** has an SCV of 23,400 ([3,000Ã—3] + [4,800Ã—3]).
A **Noble 20** has an SCV of 422,400 ([4,800Ã—6] + [9,600Ã—5]  + [19,200Ã—4]  + [38,400Ã—3]  + [76,800Ã—2]).
A **Noble 6/Jedi 5/Scoundrel 9** has an SCV of 256,800 ([4,800Ã—6] + [2,400Ã—5] + [12,000Ã—4] + [24,000Ã—3] + [48,000Ã—2]), assuming all the Noble levels were taken in order, then all the Jedi levels, then all the Scoundrel levels.
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Multiclassing Considerations</span>**
The player of a multiclass character needs to work out which class they take at each level of their heroic career to establish the correct amount of credits for that level.
Prestige classes grant the same value as the closest base class. Jedi Knight, Jedi Master, Sith Apprentice, Sith Lord, and Force Adept and Force Disciple all grant the value associated with the Jedi class. Officer and Crime Lord grant the value associated with the Noble class. All others in the SECR grant the value associated with Scoundrels, Scouts, and Soldiers.
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Assets</span>**
Additionally to your starting credits, you are assumed to have a number of credits equal to your SCV tied up in assets which can become available if liquidated. An Imperial might be selling their home on Bastion, while a fringe character might be selling off their shares in a smuggling operation. Players should have good in-character justifications for liquidating these assets, presumably due to a perceived need of emergency funding, not just metagame reasons such as "I'll never go home when I'm off adventuring anyway".
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Loans</span>**
A character can take out a loan of up to four times their SCV at character creation in order to help pay for expensive things like starships. The GM gets to determine the nature of the loan as well as the conditions of repayment and rate of interest based on the character, their personality, and their history (a Noble might receive one from a legitimate creditor, while a Scoundrel might have foolishly borrowed money from a Hutt).
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">The Wealth Talent</span>**
If a character with Noble levels takes the Wealth talent, the credits granted by that talent are in addition to the character's SCV - they do *not* become a part of the SCV and therefore doesn't count towards determining the characters Assets or the value they can take out on Loan. Please note that the talent continues to work as written - the value granted at any given level is not multiplied in the same manner as the credits granted by the SCV system.
*A 20th level Noble with Wealth as their 1st level talent would receive 1,050,000 credits from the talent plus 422,400 credits from the SCV system (totalling 1,472,400 credits). Their Assets would also be worth 422,400 credits and they could take out a Loan of up to 1,689,600 credits.*

I like it. And it makes sense that a higher level character would have more starting credits to work with.
Nicely done. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
