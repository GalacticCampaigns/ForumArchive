I feel that the desperado type of character fits quite well in Star Wars, though I can't really say if any of the established characters would fit this profile. In any case, here's my attempt to translate the desperado (as portrayed in the movie of the same name - I hope) into a Prestige Class for Saga.

The split-second timing required in martial arts makes unarmed combat potent indeed, but the study all but eschews the use of ranged weaponry. On the other hand, firearms provide excellent stopping power, but those who rely on distance often lack the ability to adequately defend themselves in melee combat. Whether by training, experience or sheer instinct, a desperado learns to fight using techniques that bridge the gap between these two distinct combat styles. When in motion, these techniques make the desperado seem to attack as if firearm and body were one and the same, and all who witness a desperado in action tend to remember their movements being as fluid as they are purposeful.
**Requirements**
To qualify to become a Desperado, a character must fulfill the following criteria:
**Base Attack Bonus:** +7
**Feats:** Combat Reflexes, Martial Arts I, Point Blank Shot
**Trained Skills:** Acrobatics
**Game Rule Information**
Desperados have the following game statistics:
**Base Attack Bonus**
Desperados gain +1 base attack bonus per class level.
**Hit Points**
At each level, desperados gain 1d8 hit points + their Constitution modifier.
**Force Points**
Desperados gain a number of Force Points equal to 6 + one-half their character level, rounded down, every time they gain a new level in this class.
**Class Features**
The following are features of the desperado prestige class.
**Defense Bonuses**
At 1st level, you gain a +3 class bonus to your Reflex Defense and a +3 class bonus to your Fortitude Defense.
**Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), you select a talent. The talent may be selected from the Desperado talent tree (presented below), the Misfortune talent tree (see Scoundrel) or the Brawler talent tree (see Soldier).
**DESPERADO TALENT TREE**
Die Hard: When fighting an opponent or multiple opponents in melee, you may spend a swift action to make a DC 20 Acrobatics check. If you succeed, you gain Damage Reduction (DR) equal to twice the number of opponents adjacent to you until the beginning of your next turn. While in effect, this DR automatically changes if the number of opponents in melee with you changes at any time. *Prerequisite:* Elusive Target
Elusive Target: Same as the Jedi talent.
Opportune Moment: Withdrawing no longer prevents your opponents from avoiding an attack of opportunity for leaving your threatened area. If you take an attack of opportunity this way, you may move to the square previously occupied by your opponent. You do not avoid attacks of opportunity, if any, for this movement.
Outnumbered: When making an attack using Wild Arms on your turn, you may target one additional opponent within your reach. You make the attack roll against the highest Reflex Defense among your targets. If you hit, you must distribute the total damage you deal among all targets, to a minimum of 1 per target.
You may select this talent multiple times. Each time you select it, you may target one additional opponent within your reach. *Prerequisite:* Wild Arms
Superior Mobility: The Mobility feat now grants it's Defense bonus to all attacks of opportunity made against you. *Prerequisite:* Mobility feat
Superior Reflexes: You may now use Combat Reflexes to take two attacks of opportunity against any single target instead of the normal one. Each attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round.
**Wild Arms**
Starting at 2nd level, when wielding a ranged weapon that can be used to take attacks of opportunity and isn't set to autofire, you may make a single attack that is considered both an unarmed melee attack and a ranged weapon attack, against one opponent in your reach. This attack is made at either your base melee or ranged attack bonus, whichever is lower. The damage you deal from this attack is equal to the sum of the damage you would normally deal from a ranged attack with your weapon and from an unarmed attack. This attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round, and requires a standard action if used during your turn.
At every even-numbered level afterwards (4th, 6th, 8th and 10th), you gain a +1 damage bonus for this attack. At 10th level, this attack is made at either your base melee or ranged attack bonus, whichever is higher.
