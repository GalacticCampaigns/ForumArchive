# Houserule: Evasion Track - Version 2 developer's discussion

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-06 12:38:58)

***EDIT: Based on discussion of this houserule ongoing in my Legacy era casting call, I have decided to rebuild this variant system from the ground up with an eye to better balance, improved simplicity, and more interesting mechanical effect. You are welcome to stick your oar in, particularly if you plan on applying to that game since whatever we hash out will directly affect you if you're accepted as a player!***
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Evasion Track </span>
This variant rule is a theoretical structure (it hasn't yet had the luxury of being tested in play) that replaces hit points with a second track that works in conjunction with the condition track to determine whether an attack hits and what effects it has. Please note that adopting this rule has widespread ramifications, some of which may not have been adequately (or at all) considered in the rules present below. If you encounter such an issue, please let the author know (along with any suggested solutions you might have).
Constructive criticism, commentary, and suggested additions are welcome.
The conversion required is quite simple. Just divide the hit points of the character or vehicle by 16 and round down. The character has 16 steps on the Evasion Track, each worth the value you just arrived at. If there are between 12 and 15 hit points left over before rounding, the character gains Evasion Resistance 1.
**Example 1 - Level 1 Soldier with Con 14 (32 hp)**
Evasion Threshold: 2
**Example 2 - AT-AT (300 hp)**
Evasion Threshold: 18, ER 1
<span style="font-size: 1.75em;">Taking Damage</span>
The damage system works as normal, and the numerical result of a damage roll (after detracting SR and DR) determines how many steps, if any, the target is knocked down the Evasion Track. If an attack deals multiple times the threshold value in damage, that is the amount of steps the target is knocked down the track.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">To Roll or Not to Roll</span>
In most instances damage dice are not rolled when using the Evasion Track house rule. Instead, the average result possible with a set of damage dice is compared to the targetâ€™s Evasion Threshold. If this value is enough to knock the target down one or more steps, that occurs automatically. A player can always choose to roll instead, and there are two instances in which that decision could be profitable:
â€¢ If an attackâ€™s average damage does not exceed the targetâ€™s Evasion Threshold (or if it normally would but is reduced to less than needed by resistances) but the threshold may be exceeded by rolling, there is nothing to lose by doing so.
â€¢ Rolling may result in a damage value high enough to knock a target additional steps down the Evasion Track. However, this will always be a gamble as a low roll could cause the attack to fail.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Evasion Resistance (ER) </span>
A form of resistance unique to this system, ER is deducted directly from an attackâ€™s damage value after SR and DR are applied.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Running out of Evasion</span>
If a character has no more steps on the Evasion Track and is hit by any attack they are knocked unconscious. If the attack would normally cause them to shift one or more steps along the track, they are considered dying and must begin making Constitution checks on the next round, rather than waiting 1 minute (though they still wait at least 1 minute before recovering if they succeed). In either case they are immediately reduced to the bottom step of the Condition Track.
A character who recovers moves a single step up the Evasion Track.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Recovering</span>
Evasion is recovered in any of the ways possible using the hit point system. The following changes are necessary:
**First Aid**
If you succeed on a DC 15 Treat Injury check, the creature moves a number of steps up the Evasion Track equal to 1 +1 for every ten points by which your check result exceeds the DC.
**Heal Damage**
You can make a DC 20 Treat Injury check to perform surgery on a wounded creature, moving them a number of steps up the Evasion Track equal to their level.
**Long-Term Care**
If you tend a creature for 8 hours, that creature moves a number of steps up the Evasion Track equal to 1 in addition to those recovered from natural healing.
**Natural Healing**
A living creature that gets eight consecutive, uninterrupted hours of rest moves one step up the Evasion Track. A Wookiee (or any other character with Extraordinary Recuperation or an equivalent ability) instead moves two steps up the track.
**Repair Droid/Object**
You can spend 1 hour and make a DC 20 Mechanics check to repair a damaged or disabled droid, object, or vehicle, moving it one step up the Evasion Track and removing any persistent conditions currently affecting it.
**Vital Transfer**
*DC 15:* The target moves one step up the Evasion Track and gain ER 2 for the duration of the encounter. You move one step down the track.
*DC 20:* The target moves one step up the Evasion Track and gains ER 4 for the duration of the encounter. You move one step down the track, and your Evasion Threshold is considered two less for the duration of the encounter.
*DC 25:* The target moves two steps up the Evasion Track and gains ER 6 for the duration of the encounter. You move two steps down the track, and your Evasion Threshold is considered three less for the duration of the encounter.

Interesting, but some examples would really help illustrate the system.
For example, if an attack doesn't do enough damage to exceed a character's Evasion Threshold then does it do no damage to the character? The paragraph about rolling damage seemed to imply this but I don't think it was expressly stated (unless I just missed it).
Would Second Wind move a character 4 steps up the ET?

That is indeed the intention. An attack that fails to meet the character's Evasion Threshold has effectively missed them. Weapon damage therefore becomes an expression of accuracy as well as lethality.

How typical of me to forget something so fundamental! Yes, under this system Second Wind would move you 4 steps up the Evasion track, which would effectively be a quarter of the character's hit points.

Okay, so let's start thinking about a way to turn this idea around.
The most common complaint, mechanical considerations aside, seems to be that the current ET is not significantly different from hit points to make the added complication worthwhile. So what can be done to change that?
The three ideas that come immediately to my mind are :

* Tie Evasion Track to the Condition Track, so that enough damage on one knocks you down the second.
* Introduce a mechanic where loss of Evasion induces fatigue in the character.
* Introduce both negative (such as the above mentioned fatigue) **and** positive effects (such as "last stand" bonuses) that are tied to the Evasion Track, similar to 4e's Bloodied system.

Thoughts? Other ideas?

IÂ´ve been thinking about this a bit, and IÂ´ve finally begun to come to terms with it, and I see the differences to Hp better now. My biggest issue now is the unbalance caused by the division by 16, like I mentioned in the example of a two characters with 32 and 43 Hp being equally tough.
For other ideas, you could possibly tie the Condition Track to this in such a way that your Condition Track penalty also removes a number of steps from your Evasion Track. So someone at -2 CT would only have 12 steps on his Evasion Track. This would make the Condition Track even more powerful in affecting your character. But it could also allow the Condition Track to restore some Evasion to a character. A character moving from -5 CT to -2 CT would regain 3 steps on his Evasion Track, being able to return to the fight again.
Not sure how to interact this in a good way with the -CT abilities that donÂ´t involve harming someone, but itÂ´s an idea.

Hoorah! Someone gets it! Heh.
Yes, I agree that it would be better to reduce that effect and will go onto that issue next.

This, I rather like.

Hmm, I havenÂ´t done any mathematical calculations at all on this, but hereÂ´s another idea.
After dividing by 16, if you have more than 8 Hp remaining, you add the Hit Points that exceeds 8 as Evasion Resistance. But your Evasion Resistance only applies against damage for checking against the first Evasion Track step. This way, characters with higher Con and higher Hp (in the case where you roll, and the differences from starting classes) still gets an edge from it. Also, seeing as the Hit Dice is a d8, it takes exactly two levels to increase your Evasion Threshold by 1, getting max Hp, but characters with high Con gets a benefit from gaining Evasion Resistance.
Examples
Soldier 1, Con 14
32 Hp, ET 2, ER 0 = Can take up to 2x16 Hp worth of damage in total
Noble 1, Con 14
20 Hp, ET 1, ER 0 = Can take up to 1x16 Hp worth of damage in total
Noble 2, Con 10
26 Hp, ET 1, ER 2 = Can take up to 1x16+2 Hp worth of damage in total, but must take 3 damage to lose his first ET step
Noble 3, Con 10
34 Hp, ET 2, ER 0 = Can take up to 2x16 Hp worth of damage in total
Noble 2, Con 14
30 Hp, ET 1, ER 6 = Can take up to 1x16+6 Hp worth of damage in total, but must take 7 damage to lose his first ET step
This still creates some difference in "worth" between ET and Hp, but it allows Con to be more effective in "toughening up" characters.

### **Anazider** (2009-06-11 21:12:31)

I just thought of something else here simply: This system tends to really break down against anything with a combination of high hitpoints and Damage reduction.
For instance, lets take T'iallo and take his build all the way to level 20, and then put him up against a CL 16 Krayt Dragon.
The krayt dragon has 399 hit points, giving it a ET of 24 and 1 ER, and it also has a DR of 15. T'iallo at level 20 would be doing an average damage of 2d10+18, or 27 damage, not enough to take the creature down the ET. Rolling for maximum damage he would still only net 38 damage, or just 1 shy of taking the creature down the ET, so it would never be reduced. Even for a character/characters above level fighting the creature it makes it near impossible to actually harm it, aside from a critical.
This persists mostly with characters fighting vehicles as well, or anything with damage reduction greater than 5.
