# Squadrons - A variant rule to make starship battles easier.

### **simplyscribed** (2008-02-01 14:17:43)

This is a placeholder for my actual post, which I should get around to tonight. I have a few tweaks to make based on a discussion in chat (thanks Anazider, Tru) before I let it "go live".
**Squadron** is a template you apply to a starfighter or airspeeder's statblock in order to turn it into a unit of multiple fighters that function as one "vehicle". It is similar to the rules for **Fighter Groups** (see page 31 of *SotG*) and essentially absorbs those and replaces them.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">SQUADRON TEMPLATE</span>
You can simulate pairs, flights, or squadrons of starfighters or airspeeders with only one statblock using this template. They must be vehicles of the same type: If a vehicle of another type does fly as part of the squadron it is treated independently, though it can benefit from the squadronâ€™s combined attack bonus if its members all fire independently and aid another.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">MODIFICATIONS</span>
**Type:** Changes from â€œstarfighterâ€ to â€œstarfighter squadronâ€ or â€œairspeederâ€ to â€œairspeeder squadronâ€.
**CL:** The CL of the squadron is based on that of the Group Leader. For every additional vehicle added to the squadron, increase its CL by 1.
**Init:** The squadron uses its Group Leaderâ€™s Initiative modifier. However, should a vehicle join the squadron it acts on that vehicleâ€™s initiative score from then onward.
**Defenses:** The squadron uses the worst defenses in the group.
**hp:** Multiply by the number of vehicles in the squadron. If the squadron includes vehicles with less than maximum hit points, average the values of all the ships then multiply that number.
**SR:** SR remains the same as the base vehicle. Even when the squadronâ€™s SR value is exceeded, it does not decrease. If the squadron includes vehicles with less than maximum SR, average the values of all the ships (rounded down to the nearest 5). The entire squadron can take the *Recharge Shields* action to increase its SR, up to its normal maximum.
**Ranged Attacks:** The concentrated fire of a vehicle unit works similarly to that of a weapon battery. For every additional vehicle in the unit beyond the first, increase the squadronâ€™s bonuses to attacks by +2. Additionally, the squadron can make a narrow salvo or proximity spread attack (see Weapon Batteries, SotG page 31).
**Damage:** The squadron uses the worst damage for each weapon type in the group.
**Base Attack:** The squadron uses the attack bonus of its Group Leader.
**Fighting Space:** In personal scale, multiply fighting space by the number of vehicles in the squadron. In starship scale, fighting space remains 1 square.
**Skills:** The squadron uses the skill modifiers of its Group Leader. If the squadron (or part of the squadron) act together, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus per additional vehicle involved after the first on the followingâ€”opposed Pilot checks for dogfighting, Use Computer checks to operate sensors, or Perception checks.
**Crew, Passengers, Cargo, Carried Craft, Payload, and Cost:** Multiply by the number of vehicles in the squadron.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">SPECIAL RULES</span>
**Joining and Leaving:** Joining a squadron is as simple as communicating this intent in character-scale combat or moving into the squadron's square in space combat. A pilot can leave the squadron by communicating that intent in character-scale combat or moving out of the squadron's square in space combat (see Act Independantly).
**Group Leader:** One pilot in the squadron must be designated Group Leader. If the squadron breaks down (see below), each resulting squadron must designate its own Group Leader.
**Act Independantly:** A squadron, while still retaining all other benefits of being a squadron, can choose to have some or all of its vehicles act independently of others. In this way, a squadron of 12 could work in flights of 4 to make 3 attacks (with each flightâ€™s base attack bonus decreasing accordingly), all 12 fighters could fire independently at their normal attack bonus, or some fighters could fire while others performed other actions such as reroute power. A vehicle that leaves its squadronâ€™s square in starship scale can no longer act as part of that squadron until such a time as it re-enters the squadronâ€™s square; in this scenario the squadron itself has its modified stats, including its hit points, reduced accordingly (see Vehicle Loss, below).
**Break Down:** A squadron can always choose to break down into smaller parts, typically pairs or flights (up to six vehicles). In doing so, each pair or flight acts as a new squadron. Divide the original squadronâ€™s hit points and alter the stats for each new squadron accordingly. When broken down, a squadronâ€™s parts can act separately and even move away from each other, though they must return to the same square if they wish to reform the squadron.
**Vehicle Loss:** Divide the squadronâ€™s hit points by the number of vehicles in the squadron: every time the squadron loses this many hit points, its attack bonus decreases by -2 and all multiplied stats are decreased by the statâ€™s original value. If a squadron is ever brought to hit points equalling or less than a single vehicle of the squadronâ€™s type, it is no longer a squadron and follows all rules for a single vehicle of its type.
**Manoeuvres:** Compare the manoeuvres of the squadron's pilots. For every manoeuvre possessed by at least half of the squadron, the squadron adds one use of that manoeuvre to its suite. This suite is seperate from those of the squadron's pilots, and when the squadron performs a manouever it spends from its own suite.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">RUNNING A SQUADRON</span>
The squadron template can vastly simplify large battles between vehicles, particularly in space combat. Even if you choose to have vehicles in the squadron act independantly, time will still be saved by the pooling of hit points, the lack of complexity of SR, and the fact that all the vehicles must fly together to remain in the squadron.
There are a few things a GM can do to streamline the process of running a squadron:
[ul][*]When you create the squadron's statblock, also include Flight (a common Flight size is 4 vehicles) and Pair stats for when it breaks down or has some of its vehicles act independently. See the example A-Wing Squadron; please note this example statblock only includes broken down stats significant during combat. Keep the statblock for a single vehicle of the squadron's type handy too.  
[*]Where possible, use NPC pilots of the same skill level and give them the same manouevers.  
[*]List a few common tactics used by the squadron that require some or all of its pilots to act independently, giving action types and page references. This can grossly simplify that process.  
[*]If possible, don't have all the squadron's vehicles act independently - if you can achieve what you want while splitting the squadron into less than four groups, it's wise to do so.  
[*]Only make use of Act Independently if there isn't an equally attractive but simpler option available.  
[*]Know the squadron's capabilities before you use it. Crunching the numbers of a few tactics you might want the squadron to use can help you understand when to use them and when not to. It should also make breaking the squadron down and having its vehicles act independently a little more intuitive.[/ul]

Please note that the template will account for maneuvers - I just haven't perfected how I want to deal with them. More coming.

Added a proposed solution for manouevers to the template.

Running a Squadron advice section added, as well as modifications to the statblock.
Barring the influence of peer analysis, I think the template is pretty solid at this point. I will be getting the opportunity to playtest it soon, in the adventure I designed it for. If you'll excuse the expression, here's hoping it flies. 8)

I've now had the chance to use squadrons in play, and I'll be honest, the experience was hellish. However, that was more to do with the mathematical and multi-tasking realities of having so many ships in play than it was to do with the template. Such as it is then, the template does simplify things and I would *hate* to be running a combat without it. As it was, I merely struggled.
I'll have to have a think and see if there aren't ways the process can be streamlined even more. I do know that I isolated some areas where additional prep would have helped me in play, and I can add that advice to the Running a Squadron section.
