# Legacy Era Tabletop Campaign - Design Diary

### **simplyscribed** (2008-02-11 04:49:28)

So, my Rebellion Era campaign came to an end (one of these days I'll update the timeline in its thread) and I'm looking to replace it with one in the Legacy Era. As I come to decisions about what I want to accomplish with this new campaign, I'll post them here. You're welcome to throw ideas at me and see if they stick, if you feel like it.
Some decisions I've already made:
[ul][*]The campaign will start with characters at 6th level. This is where the last campaign ended, and it seems like a good idea to let my players continue experiencing Saga at different levels of play. Also, it will allow their characters to be fairly settled in their builds, as well as fairly major players in the struggles of the universe - neither bad things at all.  
[*]Both the Imperial Remnant and Alliance Remnant factions are available for play. The factions are both in such straits that teamwork between members of both is not out of the realm of possibilty, and the bad blood between them can create good roleplaying opportunities. It also helps avoid a "us versus the world" attitude, my players will have to pick their enemies carefully.  
[*]Sith and/or other darksiders will be used as enemies, as I fully expect force-using PCs (They may even be in the majority or comprise the entire party this time round, based on my initial sounding of the players' desires). They won't be the be-all-and-end-all of villainy, though.  
[*]I want to work in strong themes of trust and betrayal (Ought to be fun, if I end up with a split-faction party). Enemies might as easily come from within their faction as without, but I'm not going to go as far as having every friendly turn on them - indeed, for the theme of trust to be brought in the majority of alliances made will be fruitful.  
[*]I want to tie my story in to the main story of Legacy. Not change it in any way, however. My Rebellion era heroes met Luke, Han, Chewie, and Leia at Echo Base and took part in the Battle of Hoth. None of that changes the facts as they've already been presented, but it does help work the heroes into the Star Wars world, make the players feel they have a place in the grander story. Their interactions with the story will only help support it, rather than trample on it.  
[*]I also plan to tie-in the experience of this new campaign with that of the previous campaign. Not necessarily in terms of plot, but just by using references or repeat appearances. Red might make a cameo (or play a larger part), the party might visit Legacy Era's Solsis VII (a much changed place), etc. Their own characters will probably be mentioned. I will be allowing my players to see the campaign as a continuation of what has come before, rather than a whole new vision, and continuing to build on the collected materials that make up my own interpretation of the *Star Wars* universe.[/ul]

Sounds fun <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Feel free to use Jace Starz if you wish. Realizing no matter how good he is he would still be dead by this time you still could use his force spirit and or even holocrons built by him. If you need a jedi who did not make it to the novels or comics Jace is your man.
It would be interesting to have your players fill roles from all the current alliances out there fighting the sith, including one sith. It would add role play opportunities as you have said, every player would have their own goals so even simply missions would have multiple angles.

I would say that you could use my player characters but where mine is play by post and yours is table top your group will advance far more quickly. You could still have them in the back ground maybe names on a list of wanted bounties or profile pics of known rebels. If you could keep us up on your players they may find there way into my game.
The other thing I wanted to talk about, others may want in on this, is what of some of the known star wars worlds. One hundred years later government changes wars etc.... what would have come of Endor, Hoth, Bespin and the others. We know that the Hutts lost there home world and settled on Tatooine for a time, we know that Corusant changed hands durning the vong war for a time but what of the other worlds. Many GM`s tend to leave this topic alone afraid to mess with cannon that may or may not ever be released, I say there is no harm in theorizing.
Endor:After the fall of the old empire the new republic found many usefull resources on the forest moon. Princess Leia herself petitioned not to interrupt the natural evolution of the ewok race (that does not mean that many ewoks did not set off on their own). Cloud cities where brought in to manage the mining of resources while disturbing the ewoks as little as possible. The planet spent years as a reserve of sorts until the sith empire took over, ravaging the lands they are stripping the world of all natural resources to aid in their war. Being a hardy race the ewoks have taken to the challenge forming resistance cells which do little more then annoy their sith captors. Being a cuddly race the ewoks have allies who aid them from time to time, Endor is a conflicted world.
Hoth: The new republic setup an outpost on the frozen planet and as the years went on its importance diminished until it was all but a skeleton crew during the new sith war. Easily taken the outpost was to remote to serve as a military outpost, the sith empire did see promise in the planet. The orbit was littered with automatic weapons platforms the surface with roaming hunter droids Hoth had become an ice prison to house those who would stand against the new sith empire. In keeping with the sith way Hoth serves a dual purpose as both prison and medical research facility, the screams of test subjects can be heard through out the frozen corridors.
Bespin: (I had read somewhere that luke had established a jedi temple on cloud city) Housing one of the jedi temples Cloud City was one of the first to fall to the sith-empire invasion. The city took heavy damage during the invasion and has since not been fully repaired. Currently Cloud City floats a smoking ruin, sith hunt the streets for survivors and from frequently captured peoples from other worlds are brought in as part of the hunt. The hunt has become a right of passage for many who wish to prove their worth to the sith in hopes of joining their ranks. Bands of wanna be sith roam the streets taken trophies at times even clashing with the sith who have become bored with hunting refugees. Cloud City has become a city of chaos.
Well thats a few ideas for these worlds I would like to read other ideas for these worlds or other worlds. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Yeah. I'll have to be very careful with that if I do it. I'll certainly keep you abreast of all the goings-on in my game, too. No reason why they couldn't tie in.

I'm one of those GM's that would be weary of it, honestly. There are enough sites already mentioned in the Legacy comics, enough planets that wouldn't have changed too drastically, and plenty of potential for making up my own. Making an interpretation that might clash with canon seems a little unnecessary, all those considered.
> Endor:After the fall of the old empire the new republic found many usefull resources on the forest moon. Princess Leia herself petitioned not to interrupt the natural evolution of the ewok race (that does not mean that many ewoks did not set off on their own). Cloud cities where brought in to manage the mining of resources while disturbing the ewoks as little as possible.

Hm... Endor being a moon, and with nothing important going on there, it's a little hard to imagine why the Sith Empire would even turn its attention that way. Not when they have better things to do, like exercise control over dissenting planets and chase after two rebellious factions. In fact, I would rather see it used as a base for the Alliance Remnant. To them, Endor is of great historical importance, a symbol of their roots and victory over evil and oppression.
> Hoth: The new republic setup an outpost on the frozen planet and as the years went on its importance diminished until it was all but a skeleton crew during the new sith war. Easily taken the outpost was to remote to serve as a military outpost, the sith empire did see promise in the planet. The orbit was littered with automatic weapons platforms the surface with roaming hunter droids Hoth had become an ice prison to house those who would stand against the new sith empire. In keeping with the sith way Hoth serves a dual purpose as both prison and medical research facility, the screams of test subjects can be heard through out the frozen corridors.

Well, I don't really buy into the New Republic outpost bit (unless that's actually part of canon?), because there's just nothing important on Hoth to require one. However, the Sith Empire using it as a prison is a cool idea irrespective of what it was used for before.
> Bespin: (I had read somewhere that luke had established a jedi temple on cloud city) Housing one of the jedi temples Cloud City was one of the first to fall to the sith-empire invasion. The city took heavy damage during the invasion and has since not been fully repaired. Currently Cloud City floats a smoking ruin, sith hunt the streets for survivors and from frequently captured peoples from other worlds are brought in as part of the hunt. The hunt has become a right of passage for many who wish to prove their worth to the sith in hopes of joining their ranks. Bands of wanna be sith roam the streets taken trophies at times even clashing with the sith who have become bored with hunting refugees. Cloud City has become a city of chaos.

I see no mention of the temple in Cloud City's entry on wookiepedia. There is support for the idea in Jedi Academy, which has a multiplayer temple map on Bespin. I'd consider that dubiously canon, but there's no real reason why there couldn't be one there, so let's roll with it. However, the hunt idea doesn't sit with me. 1) The Sith aren't that numerous and 2) Neither they or their underlings are likely qualified to run a Tibanna gas mining colony. To me this suggests one of two things - either the Sith completely destroyed the colony in the attack, sending it plunging down into Bespin's core, or they are using the Tibanna mining facilities to turn a profit. If it's the latter, they would need the survivors of their attack, and wouldn't be hunting them like dogs through the streets.
Not that the hunt idea is necessarily a bad one, but I'd implement it in another way, and probably elsewhere in the Galaxy. In fact, I'd be inclined to combine it with my idea for The Game - wannabe Sith are pitched against each other as well as slaves and captured rebels in the arena. If they survive, they are considered for apprenticeship. It probably wouldn't be the main way of arranging apprenticeships, but the way I see it the Sith are a chaotic enough organisation that different members would go about things in different ways. This sadistic challenge might be the twisted brainchild of the Sith villain for my game, in fact.

Good points simply. As for the temple on Cloud City I did read that on a ep 7 spoff that was released so its not cannon (I could not remeber where I read it till just now). Hoth having a base I could see a small outpost if only to keep pirates out.
When do you think you will get your game going? I would like to keep up on it, crossing it over would be cool what timne line have you chosen to use?

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Villains of the Piece</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Garenn Veldari</span>
**Human Jedi/Noble**
A distant descendant of Anyl Veldari, the dark apprentice of Vader fought by Quo T'wal and his comrades back in the Rebellion Era. Garenn was a Jedi until the destruction of the temple on Ossus. In the intervening seven years, he has grown jaded and become a "grey Jedi". Disappearing into obscurity, he used his "Jedi mind-tricks" to take over Angarr Arms, a Corellian manufacturer of arms and munitions, pretending to be the wealthy heir of the Angarr fortune come to claim his inheritance. He now lives the sweet life under the pseudonym of "Evan Angarr", though he is constantly on the watch for the threat of Sith or reprisals from his erstwhile Jedi allies.
*I forget where and with whom the idea for a "corporate Jedi" originated. I think someone posted it over on the WotC boards. Either way, it's a cool idea and I'm appropriating it for my campaign.*
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Sith Triumvirate</span>
*Not many details on this lot yet, other than that they are a group of closely linked Sith that will be the PC's main antagonists. I want at least two of them to be non-Human, because I have a habit of making my important NPCs Human that I need to break. I'm not sure of level/class breakdowns yet.*
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Kendel Jerrth</span>
**Gotal Noble/Scoundrel/Crime Lord**
Powerful and villainous leader of the Rabid Meek crime cartel. He will be the campaign's primary "non-Forcie" antagonist. He has a smuggling arrangement with Garenn Veldari.
*Again, I'm striving for Non-Human NPCs. Gotal strike me as interesting because of their empathic abilities. That seemed a perfect aid for a crime lord.*
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">EV-2X9</span>
**EV-series supervisor droid**
Like EV-9D9 before her, EV-2X9 is abnormally sadomasochistic. 2X9 has arose to a position of influence in the Droid Federation, a loose alliance of free-willed droids (typically, the droids arrange themselves into factions of like-programmed individuals who then crew ships or - in the case of the largest groups - fleets) who were pushing for rights in the Galactic community at the time the Galactic Alliance fell. In this time of political upheaval, the Droid Federation has largely remained neutral, but many, 2X9 included, are happy to court the current power. She will happily work with the Sith, and has ties to Kendel Jerrth as well (the faction of the Droid Federation she leads is little concerned with legalities, and acquires much, including Angarr Arms weapons, from the Rabid Meeks' smuggling ring).
*I wanted a droid villain. I also wanted to do something with the "droids as a free and political entity" idea that Anazider, Tru, and I were hashing out in chat. Note that a large part of the Droid Federation is "good", or as good as droids can be, and respectful of the legal systems they wish to gain rights in. Other factions, such as that led by 2X9, simply want power and have little respect for anything other than their own desires. Thinking about a villainous droid immediately led me to think about the torture supervisor in* Return of the Jedi*. I looked her up and bingo, I had a concept.*

Why would they need to keep pirates out? There's nothing there to worry about. If they simply want to stop pirates using it as a base, then they'd need to put outposts on all uninhabited planets, moons, and even in asteroid fields. That's a practical impossibility. I don't really see why an exception would be made in Hoth's case.
> When do you think you will get your game going? I would like to keep up on it, crossing it over would be cool what timne line have you chosen to use?

Probably next week. If I'm going to run this at all I need to get it started as soon as possible before the end of the academic year. As for timeline, I'm thinking of having the events of my campaign start roughly around the same time as the events of the comics (and therefore your game), though I may start it a year or two earlier. That'll give your game a little time to get further before mine catches up, if nothing else.

> <span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Villains of the Piece</span>

Since the campaign is starting at 6th level, and is highly unlikely to get beyond 15th (and even that is a bit doubtful), it's possible to make a rough plan of when each villain should be dealt with.
The party will probably get tangled up in the machinations of all the antagonists before they can deal with any of them conclusively, but here's the order in which they'll likely be faced.
**Levels 6-7:** Introductory adventures to immerse the players in the setting and get the ball rolling with the plot. Probably all the villains, or their minions, should make appearances of some sort during this period.
**Levels 8-10:** EV-2X9 and her droid forces will be the first challenge to tackle. During this story arc, Red is likely to make his first appearance as a loosely affiliated member of the Droid Federation. He will be a potential ally. EV-2X9's ties with the *Rabid Meeks* will lead the PCs to...
**Levels 11-13:** Kendel Jerrth, and through his Angarr Arms smuggling connection to Garenn Veldari. The two will represent equivalent threats in terms of personal power. However, they are two very different challenges. Jerrth has the might of a criminal cartel behind him, while Veldari can hide behind his false persona and use his Corellian connections to get the PCs on the wrong side of politicians or even CorSec. The PCs can choose to deal with the two in whichever order they prefer.
**Levels 14-15:** Finally, the Sith Triumvirate represent the capstone villains of this campaign. However they're involved with the entangled plot (which they will be, to a greater or lesser extent), the mere presence of Force-users in the party will be enough for them to be harrying the PCs with their minions throughout the campaign. Lower level lackeys may well ally themselves with any of the other villains to improve their chances of capturing Force-using PCs. Since there are three of the Sith, it seems to me that they should represent three different "bosses" for three different adventures, each being a different challenge than the last. Alternatively, an *en masse* battle might be necessary, since I believe a majority of my PCs will be Force-users. Of course, they'll all have lower level Sith minions...
Obviously these numbers are guesswork, and my campaign might not reach that level or might go beyond it. But it should help me come up with some base builds for the lot of them.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">The Sith</span>
This is a general proposal for the Sith's names and their functions within the group. Their races and class makeups are up in the air as of the time of posting, but it's apparent that certain builds will suggest themselves. Darth Morde should no doubt have Scoundrel levels, Darth Odyl Noble Levels, and Darth Ferahl Soldier levels, for example.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Darth Morde</span>
A deadly and efficient killer, Darth Morde is under consideration to become a Hand. She desires much more. Though loyal to the Sith Order, she has no respect for superiors - beyond a grudging allowance of their power. They are merely blocks on her personal path to power, to be removed for her good and the good of the Sith. The de facto leader of the trio, Darth Morde has brought together her allies in the hopes of a bid for power. Darth Odyl will be her voice and Darth Ferahl, who she alone can exert any measure of control over, will be a bludgeon to smite her enemies - and if the bludgeon breaks itself in the force of its attack, so be it. She herself plans to be the precise instrument of destruction when it comes time to displace the Sith's current hierarchy.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Darth Odyl</span>
Darth Odyl's weapon of choice is her body. Exuding grace, charm, and raw sex appeal, she is a paragon of manipulation. With a word, a smile, or even just a shift of her hips, she can capture your attention and begin twisting you to her will. Her affinity for the subtler variations of Force use is her ally in this. Though deferring to Darth Morde thanks to her power and apparent influence over the normally bone-headed Darth Ferahl, Darth Odyl would not live up to her reputation if she were not harbouring plans of her own. True to her nature, she takes every opportunity she can to shift the balance of power between them.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Darth Ferahl</span>
Even by the standards of the Sith, Darth Ferahl is a beast. He presents himself with only the barest modicum of civility and delights in nothing more than slaughter, requiring of himself no justification for his indiscriminate cruelty and killing, and sometimes forgoing the use of both his saber and the Force to experience the tactile pleasure of murdering with his bare hands. He is tolerated by the other Sith only because of the sheer power he brings to the alliance and the ease at which he can be manipulated. However, single-minded and simple to please as he is, he is not stupid. Within him lies a cunning mind, and he may not be so easily taken in by their machinations as they believe.

As I stated in the Introduce Myself thread I love the Legacy era and am planning a campaign myself.
I want to tie in some other EU sources as well, like having the PC's come across a new Master to learn from going by the name the Exile and also come across a beaten up Ebon Hawk for the KOTOR games tying into Kreia's prophesy that the Ebon Hawk and the Exile's crew will rebuild the Jedi Order with possibly using a new Chu'unthor as a headquarters and Academy.
Also thinking of using a variant of an idea for a Droid Federation you came up with simplyscribed as I think it would make for a nice addition to say the Outer Rim bordering the Unknown Regions as my PC's leave known space to search for clues as to the Sith's reemergence and attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Villainous Politics</span>
**Darth Ferahl is…** a Sith, high-ranking in the Order's hierarchy, whose simple pleasures in life are cruelty and killing.
**Darth Ferahl will ally with…**
[ul][*]Darth Morde: For some reason, Darth Ferahl has a great respect for Darth Morde. Though far from obedient, he will take orders from her even at risk to himself.[/ul]  
**Darth Morde is…** a Sith, high-ranking in the Order's hierarchy, who is an efficient investigator and killer. She is under consideration to be a Hand, but has other, grander plans for herself.
**Darth Morde will ally with…**
[ul][*]Anyone who furthers her aims, but only if the deal is heavily biased in her favour or she can cut out of it later with acceptable loss.[/ul]  
**Darth Odyl is…** a Sith, high-ranking in the Order's hierarchy, who is a paramount manipulator and an effective spy.
**Darth Odyl will ally with…**
[ul][*]Anyone who can help her overturn the current power relationship between herself and Darth Morde. Rather like her rival in many ways, Darth Odyl will arrange for the deal to be all take and little give, and will stab a partner in the back as soon as they become a burden.[/ul]  
**EV-2X9 is…** leader of a militant, semi anti-organic faction of the Droid Federation.
**EV-2X9 will ally with…**
[ul][*]Kendel Jerrth: EV-2X9 and her factions receive arms and other inventory cheaply through Jerrth's smuggling activities.  
[*]Garenn Veldari: If approached on behalf of Veldari by Jerrth, EV-2X9 would be willing to work with him.  
[*]The Sith (any): Entirely mercenary in nature, able to see where the power in the Galaxy currently lies and hope to take advantage, EV-2X9 would happily ally herself with agents of the Sith.[/ul]  
**Kendel Jerrth is…** a crime lord in control of the Rabid Meeks.
**Kendel Jerrth will ally with…**
[ul][*]EV-2X9: EV-2X9 and her faction are some of Jerrth's best customers in the smuggling market. He won't do them any favours, but he'd be willing to aid them.  
[*]Garenn Veldari: The smuggling deal he has arranged with Evan Angarr has been very profitable for the Rabid Meeks and Jerrth personally. To protect that source of income he would do much.  
[*]Darth Morde: Although there's no way he'd like her, Jerrth could be intimidated into compliance by Morde. Their personalities are just similar enough that they might even find the relationship mutually rewarding.  
[*]Darth Odyl: Let's face it, with Odyl he might not even have a choice.[/ul]  
**Garenn Veldari is…** a grey Jedi posing as Evan Angarr, fabulously wealthy young owner of Angarr Arms.
**Garenn Veldari will ally with…**
[ul][*]EV-2X9: Veldari would consider the droids of the Droid Federation as expendable pawns in his game.  
[*]Kendel Jerrth: The smuggling deal the two have arranged could be damaging to Veldari's lifestyle and bring him into much unwanted public attention if it goes sour. Veldari will work to avoid that.  
[*]Darth Odyl: Let's face it, with Odyl he might not even have a choice. Odyl is also scheming enough that she might not kill Veldari should she discovery his Jedi nature.[/ul]

master_Tru or simplyscribed,
Do either of you or anyone for that matter know where I can find stats for ships from the Legacy era. I know the Paellon class Star Destroyer, Predator class Starfighter and the X-83 Twintail are in Starships of the Galaxy but are there any more? The Crossfire or Scythe class? I saw a YT-2400 in issue 20 or so, so I know older era shps can be used but just want to have as much at my fingertips as possible. Thanks.

SO far thats all I have seen out there (Paellon class Star Destroyer, Predator class Starfighter and the X-83 Twintail and the older ships) I am still looking though. You could always build them <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
