# Lightsaber Form Regimen (second draft - comments plz)

### **Thraken** (2009-06-14 12:29:43)

This here be a pretty bad first draft of lightsaber training regimen for a certain idea of mine. I need to take a look at the whole thing and change or balance things more, so could use some input.
<strong>Form I Velocities</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The simplest and first lightsaber form a Jedi learns. The basics of the form originate from the simple swings of a bladed weapon with its advanced tenets focusing on precise strikes and taking advantage of its wide sweeps.
**Time:** 1 hour. **Target:** You. **Requirements:** Training lightsabers and sparring partner or training remote
**Make a Use the Force check.** The result determines the benefits of the regimen.

</details>

<strong>Form II Velocities</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The lightsaber form developed to counter lightsaber wielders. It can be thought of as a highly specialised sword form for dealing with the lethal properties of a lightsaber blade and even those who do not use the classical form of Makashi may benefit from this drill.

**Special:** If you possess the Makashi Talent you may use your deflection bonus from lightsaber defense in place of the competence bonuses from this Regimen.

</details>

<strong>Form III Velocities</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The defensive form developed during the proliferation of energy weapons, relying on endurance and efficient movement in order to counter blaster attacks from all angles.

</details>

<strong>Form IV Velocities</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The fast form dependant on dexterity and the force to strike opponents

</details>

<strong>Form V Velocities</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A balanced form with emphasises counterattack along with defense. As Jedi are more often faced with critical missions and outnumbered by blaster users some choose to use this form in order to defend themselves while swiftly resolving the situation.

<strong>Form VI Velocities</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A balanced form taking lessons from all the previous forms.

Those dedicated to the study of this form may themselves become strong lightsaber duellists.

Force an opponent to reroll a Use the Force check against you and take the worse result.
**Special:** One may choose to take 10 on this force regimen. If you possess the Niman talent you may take 20 by increasing the time spent to one hour.

</details>

<strong>Form VII Velocities</strong>
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

A rarely taught form due to it's high demands. This form requires the user to put all of their effort into attack, leaving precious little to defend themselves from any form of attack including the lure of the dark side.
**Time:** One hour. **Target:** You. **Requirements:** Lightsaber (Or training lightsaber) and sparring partner. **Make a Use the Force check.** The result determines the benefits of the regimen.
**DC 26:** You gain the benefit of the Dodge Feat and you may reroll a natural one on an attack roll
**DC 32:** As DC 26 and you may gain a +1 Attack Bonus for every -1 penalty to all defenses. This may not exceed your Heroic Level.
**DC 38:** As DC 32 and you may gain the benefit of Vaapad when using the DC 32 effect.
Special: If you voluntarily gain a Dark Side point you may gain the benefit of the next DC grade. If you possess the Juyo Talent your will defense is not subject to penalties and you gain a temporary force point

</details>

I want to get the individual features of each regimen right before giving the whole thing a massive carving up for balance.

## Re: Lightsaber Form Regimen (draft - comments plz)

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-14 13:10:12)

Okay, IÂ´ll try to make some comments on each regimen here. If I somewhere refers to "what a form should be" then that will be according to my own opinion, based on my experience with games, books, wookiepedia and martial arts training. IÂ´ll try to offer some suggestions as well on how to change them. Be warned though, that I might be affected in my critique be my opinion that this is unnecessary, now that we have the existing Regimens, as well as the Form Powers.
**Form 1**
Seems weird to me. Getting Block/Deflect can of course be useful early on, but if you have any intention of getting the Shii-Cho or Sorese talents, you will soon have invalidated most use of this regimen, all youÂ´ll be left with is the flanking immunity and a possibility to get Weapon Focus. Not worth it IMO. I know, you still have use of it, since you gain a Force Power for each talent/feat you already have, but thatÂ´s just insanely overpowered (not just for this form, but for all forms), as the only regimen that adds a Force Power adds only one use, and the lightsaber form powers will likely see more use than Farseeing.
**Suggestion:** Let the regimen give a bonus to disarming attacks (one of Shii-ChoÂ´s traits) and grant access to the Severing Strike talent at the highest DC. Pretty much like VoÂ´renÂ´s First Cadence works. Also make it require a training saber to use, itÂ´s hard to practice disarming/maiming with a real saber.
**Form 2**
First of all, why involve Riposte? It canÂ´t even be used unless you have Block. The system has deemed Lightsaber Defense to be the thing to use to emulate Makashi (even though I think Block would be a better choice, given MakashiÂ´s weakness to blasterfire). Secondly, adding the bonus from Lightsaber Defense to all those things is just too much (+4-5 for the average Makashi user IÂ´d guess).
**Suggestion:** Have it improve attacks of opportunity, and maybe allow it to give you an extra copy of the Lightsaber Defense talent.
**Form 3**
First of all, the first DC benefit is a joke. DC 18 for getting a +1 to Reflex Defense and Deflect rolls? Second, once again, why make people have both Lightsaber Defense and the Block/Deflect combo? In this case, all other Soresu related abilities improved Block/Deflect, this regimen hardly mentions them. Third, this has the most broken progression of bonus Force Powers yet. Not that IÂ´d think any Soresu user would have Lightsaber Defense(x3), but with this regimen available, expect to see them increasing in numbers, and people might even start to use Dodge.
**Suggestion:** Here you could have those bonuses vs flanking from Form 1 (Soresu is useful against multiple opponents), and you could also have this regiman work as a combination of Training Remote/Sparring Practice, giving you pretty much the benefit of those two regimens.
ThatÂ´ll have to do it for now.

Ooh.. pain <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Also quite a significant repertoire :o
**Form I**
Form one is referred to as the first thing Jedi must learn to use a lightsaber. So yeah, I wanted it for the low levels and Jedi who don't specialise in lightsabering. I'll accept your comment on the form powers though.
The immunity to flanking and weapon focus is modeled off the Kotor II Shii-cho. I believe it contains some of the last remaining vestige of Lightsaber Form lore that hasn't been assimilated into Saga.
**Form II**
I may add Block back in then. it was there in the early scribbles.
As the expansion of LD - maybe just to damage initially, And later and with talent add to AoOs and riposte against lightsaber users only. (again modeled off the Kotor II Makashi)
**Form III**
I guess the wording is unclear there - The dodge bonus to Deflect actually refers to fighting defensively - the bonus to deflect comes from the fighting defensively or total defense. This is why considered trained in Acrobatics for Fighting defensively is included in Soresu benefits.
> why make people have both Lightsaber Defense and the Block/Deflect combo

because it's supposed to be the uber defense form.
As mentioned above I guess losing almost all the powers will be part of the next version.

**Form 1**
IMO, disarming and non-lethal combat is the traits of Shii-Cho, as well as some basic defensive improvement, especially against multiple opponents. So yes, something against flanking should probably be included, as well as something to boost disarms. You could very well leave Block/Deflect out of it, as I donÂ´t think that is part of "basic lightsaber training".
**Form II**
Using Lightsaber Defense for other things is a good idea, but consider that any character who has the Makashi talent has at least a +3 bonus. +3 to Opportunity Attacks, Riposte Attacks, Block checks and Damage rolls for 24 hours for DC 23 (easy at level 8) is a LOT.
**Form III**
What I meant was that Dodge is a very low-powered feat. And having both defensive options donÂ´t seem to be the ultimate defense IMO, as one counters the other out. If you take effort to improve your Reflex Defense, Block/Deflect becomes less necessary, and vice versa. At least thatÂ´s how I always looks at it.
Oh, and for lore about the forms, Wookiepedia is the best source as far as IÂ´m concerned, as long as you take the time to interpret the very descriptive texts.

**Form I**
Those younglings practising blaster bolt deflection in Attack of the Clones weep at your belittling of their training :P I guess it's the whole block or deflect or lightsaber defense argument that was in some article somewhere.
My interpretation is that it's simply about how to swing the lightsaber as a weapon. Not a lot different from swinging a claymore or a club or a sword like object. I got this from the wookieepedia, apparently Kit Fisto comments on how hard it is to hold back with Form I.
Then I add emphasis on precise strikes based on the disarming bit that the older d20 Star Wars added.
The defense from multiple opponents bit is from Kotor II. I imagine the emphasis on swinging slashes is employed to that effect.
**Form II**
might drop in the old force point, per day or per encounter then - and looking at all the other makashi stuff in JATM for reference.
**Form III**
improved dodge maybe?
And one rather powerful effect of block and deflect according to errata is the ability to negate critical hits.
I guess I could just go back to numerical bonuses to Block & Deflect. Or maybe add Lightsaber Defense to the checks >:D hmm... or maybe wholesale adding of defense bonuses (except for heroic or armor) to the checks :o

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-06-14 16:00:51)

**Form I**
Well, I guess then itÂ´s back to the whole "Does a Jedi need Deflect to block away blaster bolts with his lightsaber?" thing. And I think the answer to that question has been stated enough times already. "Basic lightsaber training" shouldnÂ´t require the character to know additional talents and feats, thus simple, plain bonuses to attack rolls and Reflex Defense should be fine.
The disarm bonuses really comes more form this being the core of Jedi lightsaber training, and their goal was to end battles without injury if possible.
**Form III**
Yeah, itÂ´s powerful to be able to negate critical hits, but I still think taking both Block/Deflect and Lightsaber Defense is overkill, and talents/feats/other abilities should affect one or the other, not both.
