# Custom Class: Assassin

### **zenkatarn** (2009-12-01 19:51:27)

This is a custom class I made for the game I'm about to start, based on Assassin's Creed. I thought I'd post it to get some feedback on it, help me balance it a little better, stuff like that.

<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Hit Points**</span>
Assassins begin play at 1st level with 24 + Con modifier hit points. At every subsequent level, Assassins gain 1d8 + Con modifier hit points.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Force Points**</span>
Assassins gain a number of Force Points equal to 5 + one-half their heroic level rounded down.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Defense Bonuses**</span>
+2 Reflex, +1 Fortitude
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Assassin&#39;s Blade and Robes**</span>
All Assassins start with a free Assassin's Blade and Robes. At 7th level, you will be expected to build your own Assassin's Blade, and may add modifications at that time.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Starting Feats**</span>
Armor Proficiency (light)
Conditioning
Weapon Proficiency (advanced melee)
Weapon Proficiency (simple)
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Talents**</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Assassination Talent Tree**</span>
Assassins are masters of stealth and disguise, and use their skill in stealth to its fullest potential. You belong to the stealthiest class in the game.
**Assassinate:** When a target is unaware of you, you may perform a Coup de Grace attack against it with your Assassin's Blade. When attempting this, your stealth checks to remain unnoticed take a -5 penalty. In addition, if the target is not helpless, you must beat the target's Reflex Defense (minus its bonus from Dex) in order to perform the Coup de Grace.
**Blend:** You may use your stealth modifier instead of your deception modifier to create a deceptive appearance.
**Gentle Push:** Large crowds are no longer considered difficult terrain.
**Pickpocketer:** When you attempt to pickpocket, your target does not get a +5 bonus to their perception check.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Free Running Talent Tree**</span>
Assassins are skilled at evading pursuit and performing death-defying leaps. You are able to outrun and outmaneuver any other class.
**Combat Dodge:** When using the Dodge feat, the bonus increases to +3.
*Prerequisites:* Dodge, Melee Defense feats
**Leap of Faith:** When using the jump down aspect of the jump skill, you may reduce the damage taken by 6 meters (4 squares) for every 5 points your roll exceeds the DC.
**Running Start:** Assuming you get a running start of at least 4 squares, you may long jump by beating a DC of only 2 times the distance and high jump by beating a DC of only 10 times the distance.
**Skilled Climber:** You may take 10 on all Climb checks, even when distracted or threatened. In addition, you may climb half your speed as a move action and your full speed as a full round action. Using the Accelerated Climbing aspect of the Climb skill lets you climb as one and a half times your speed.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Swordplay Talent Tree**</span>
Assassins must be skilled with the blade. Your mastery of the sword goes far beyond that of other classes.
**Block:** As Jedi Block talent, but usable only with advanced melee weapons and substitute Initiative check for Use the Force check. Also, this talent can only be used against physical weapons.
**Combo Attack:** Once per encounter, after successfully hitting an opponent with a melee attack using a small or larger melee weapon, you may make an immediate attack of opportunity against the same enemy or an adjacent one at a -5 penalty.
**Counter:** Once per turn, after successfully blocking an attack with the Block talent, you may make an immediate attack of opportunity against the opponent who attacked you.
*Prerequisite:* Block
**Improved Counter:** When making an attack of opportunity with the Counter talent, you may spend a Force Point to make your opponent flat-footed until the start of your next turn.
*Prerequisites:* Block, Counter
**Skilled Duelist:** You may apply the Weapon Finesse feat to medium or larger melee weapons.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Underhanded Tactics Talent Tree:**</span>
An Assassin must use tactics others would frown upon in order to survive. You are more devious and unpredictable than any other class.
**Bladed Surprise:** Once per encounter, after successfully hitting an opponent with a melee attack, you may make an immediate attack of opportunity with a tiny weapon. The enemy is considered flat-footed for the purpose of this attack of opportunity.
**Capture:** Opponents grabbed with the Pin feat grant you soft cover against enemies in front of you.
*Prerequisites:* Pin feat
**Execute:** After capturing an opponent with Pin, you may use this talent to make a Coup de Grace attack against the captured opponent as a full round action.
*Special:* If the Assassin's Blade is used for this attack, a successful attack will triple the damage or, with the Triple Crit feat, quadruple it.
*Prerequisites:* Bladed Surprise, Capture, Pin feat
**Unarmed Disarm:** Once per turn, when you are fighting defensively and your hands are free, you may attempt to disarm an opponent with an unarmed attack roll at a -5 penalty opposed to the attack roll of your opponent. You must be adjacent to your opponent to use this talent, and your opponent's attack must be a melee attack.
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Bonus Feats**</span>
At every even-numbered level, an Assassin may chose a bonus feat that he meets the prerequisites for from the following list:
Accelerated Strike, Acrobatic Strike, Armor Proficiency (medium), Bantha Rush, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Critical Strike, Crush, Dodge, Double Attack, Duel Weapon Mastery I, II, III, Echani Training, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Extra Second Wind, Flurry, Follow Through, Great Cleave, Improved Charge, Improved Disarm, Improved Rapid Strike, Increased Agility, Long Haft Strike, Martial Arts I, II, III, Melee Defense, Mighty Swing, Mobility, Pin, Poison Resistance, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Quick Skill, Rapid Strike, Relentless Attack, Running Attack, Skill Focus, Skill Training, Throw, Trip, Triple Attack, Triple Crit, Tumble Defense, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Proficiency, Whirlwind Attack, Withdrawal Strike, Unswerving Resolve
<span style="font-size: 1.20em;">**Starting Credits**</span>
Assassins start with 3d4 x 200 credits.
I've also made some custom equipment for the game:
**Assassin's Blade**
**Cost** 3000; **Damage** 2d4; **Size** Tiny; **Type** Simple
**Description** The Assassin's Blade is a small blade inside a metal sheath attached to the underside of the wielder's arm. The blade can be extended from the sheath with a slight, almost unnoticeable movement, and retracted just as easily. Extending and retracting the blade is a swift action or, with Quick Draw, a free action.
**Special** The blade is granted a +2 bonus to stealth checks to remain hidden and is given concealment when retracted. When extended, the blade loses concealment.
**Assassin's Robes**
**Class** Light; **Cost** 4000; **Defenses** Ref -, Fort +2; **Max Dex Bonus** -
**Description** Basic white robes designed to seem inconspicuous but also allow for easy access to hidden weapons. These robes are complete with leather chest guards, bracers, and shin guards, and a hood to help hide the wearer's face.
**Special** While wearing these robes, all stealth checks to hide small or smaller items and deception checks to avoid recognization are granted +2. In addition, the wearer need not give up his heroic level bonus to Reflex Defense to wear this armor.
**Throwing Knives**
**Cost** 20; **Damage** 1d4; **Size** Tiny; **Type** Simple
**Description** Tiny knives designed for throwing.
**Special** These knives are granted a +2 bonus to stealth checks to remain hidden.

OK, let´s see now. I don´t have my books with me now so I´ll just compare it against other things from memory.
First, the equipment. The special sword and the throwing knives seems unnecessary, since there exists nearly identic equipment already, and I just find the small +2 bonuses annoying.
Now, for the class itself. It seems to be getting an awful lot of things from start, with many powerful starting feats, and 7k credits worth of equipment. You might want to change Improved Agility to Conditioning, since the former actually has the latter as a prereq. An alternative is to say that you gain Imp Agility for free once you meet the prereqs, but that seems a little unfair. Generally I´d suggest doing either of the above, and remove Force Sensitivity as a starting feat, since the class in itself don´t seem to have much that uses the Force.
**Talents**
**Assassinate** - I´m not sure how this is meant to work. I think that generally when you try to stab someone in the back with a knife, you pretty much give up on him not noticing you. Or did the penalty affect Stealth checks against other targets? Anyway, I think there was some talent in GoW that allowed you to make CDGs easier. Might be worth checking out.
**Blend** - The condition for using it seems a little vauge. If you can gain a bonus toi avoiding notice, it seems like the crowd should have to be quite big.
**Gentle Push** - Seems complicated, and why the initial +5 bonus? Also, since Persuasion isn´t a class skill, perhaps another skill would be appropriate?
**Combat Dodge** - Exceptionally overpowered. I know very few abilities that gives a permanent +4 RD bonus. even though its a dodge bonus affecting only one target, I still think it is way over the line.
**Leap of faith** - I don´t remember the exact math in my head, but it seems like DC 35 might make it MORE difficult than usual to avoid damage from falling. Isn´t the normal DC 15 for reduceing damage by 4 squares, and then reduce by an additional 4 squares for every 5 you beat the DC with? Because that makes a DC 30 to negate damage from 18 squares, and DC 35 for 22 squares. Also, DC 20 to reduce any damage by half seems overpowered.
**Block** - Since I suggested removing Force Sensitivity as a starting feat, I´m going to suggest using Initiative for this.
**Counter** - Definitely needs a useage limit. I would suggest simply copying Riposte.
**Improved Counter** - If Counter is restricted, this might be ok, but I´d probably add in needing to spend a Force Point or so.
**Skill Duelist** - Seems overpowered, given that it basically affects pretty much all melee weapons.
**Capture** - Seems complicated, can´t you just say that opponents you´ve used the Pin feat on grants you soft cover, and put Pin as a prereq?
**Execute** - I´m going to refer to Pin once again. I´m not sure if it works this way already, but Pin makes an opponents helpless right?
**Unarmed Disarm** - Needs a useage limit, and also seems very overpowered, given the very difficult normal rules for disarming.
All in all, the class seems good, if somewhat overpowered. It seems a bit misplaced in the SW universe though. You may wish to consider things like what if someone uses Unarmed Disarm when someone tries to use their gun as a club?

### **zenkatarn** (2009-12-02 13:11:17)

Ok, I don't have much time right now, so I'll go through this real quick.
> First, the equipment. The special sword and the throwing knives seems unnecessary, since there exists nearly identic equipment already, and I just find the small +2 bonuses annoying.

Yeah, they might be a little unnecessary, but I like them. ^^ Unless you can think of some better way to represent them, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
> Now, for the class itself. It seems to be getting an awful lot of things from start, with many powerful starting feats, and 7k credits worth of equipment. You might want to change Improved Agility to Conditioning, since the former actually has the latter as a prereq.

Generally I´d suggest doing either of the above, and remove Force Sensitivity as a starting feat, since the class in itself don´t seem to have much that uses the Force.

I was actually going to houserule that Increased Agility didn't require Conditioning as a prereq, but now that I think about it, starting with Conditioning makes more sense. I'll change that and put Increase Agility on the Bonus Feat list. As to the Force, I was originally planning to make it a Force Tradition, but after finishing the class, all of one talent used the Force. ^^' So, I'll go ahead and drop Force Sensitivity. It's more fun to be a non-Force using Assassin anyway. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
> **Assassinate** - I´m not sure how this is meant to work. I think that generally when you try to stab someone in the back with a knife, you pretty much give up on him not noticing you. Or did the penalty affect Stealth checks against other targets? Anyway, I think there was some talent in GoW that allowed you to make CDGs easier. Might be worth checking out.

The penalty is to other people noticing what you're doing. And, unfortunately, I don't have GoW, or even know what it stands for. ^^'
> **Blend** - The condition for using it seems a little vauge. If you can gain a bonus toi avoiding notice, it seems like the crowd should have to be quite big.

Keep in mind, this class is inspired by the Assassin's Creed games, and in ACII, you can blend with a crowd of three or more people to avoid notice. The idea is that you make yourself look like just another member of the crowd, and therefor not worth investigating.
> **Gentle Push** - Seems complicated, and why the initial +5 bonus? Also, since Persuasion isn´t a class skill, perhaps another skill would be appropriate?

Again, being based off AC, I wanted to integrate the gentle push mechanic of the games and this was all I could think of to do it. The +5 bonus is because it's generally not too hard to gently push someone out of your way, unless they don't like you.
> **Combat Dodge** - Exceptionally overpowered. I know very few abilities that gives a permanent +4 RD bonus. even though its a dodge bonus affecting only one target, I still think it is way over the line.

I kind of thought the same thing when making it, but I like the number 5. ^^' Would it be less broken if it was +4 or +3?
> **Leap of faith** - I don´t remember the exact math in my head, but it seems like DC 35 might make it MORE difficult than usual to avoid damage from falling. Isn´t the normal DC 15 for reduceing damage by 4 squares, and then reduce by an additional 4 squares for every 5 you beat the DC with? Because that makes a DC 30 to negate damage from 18 squares, and DC 35 for 22 squares. Also, DC 20 to reduce any damage by half seems overpowered.

See, this is what I get for not doing the math. -_-* Maybe change the DC of halving the damage to 30 and drop the nullifying damage part?
> **Block** - Since I suggested removing Force Sensitivity as a starting feat, I´m going to suggest using Initiative for this.

Good idea.
> **Counter** - Definitely needs a useage limit. I would suggest simply copying Riposte.
> **Improved Counter** - If Counter is restricted, this might be ok, but I´d probably add in needing to spend a Force Point or so.

Once again, I point to the AC series as my guideline for making this talent. In AC, you can counter an opponent any time you block their attack. And in the game, it's usually an instant kill. Riposte puts a 1/encounter limit on it, which just doesn't work for me at all. Maybe 1/turn, though? Or, if you think it's still too unbalaced, maybe allow it to be taken multiple times, with each pick adding one use per encounter?
> **Skill Duelist** - Seems overpowered, given that it basically affects pretty much all melee weapons.

Maybe make it so it only works with medium or larger weapons?
> **Capture** - Seems complicated, can´t you just say that opponents you´ve used the Pin feat on grants you soft cover, and put Pin as a prereq?
> **Execute** - I´m going to refer to Pin once again. I´m not sure if it works this way already, but Pin makes an opponents helpless right?

Oh. Again, that's what I get for not doing the research. -_-' It says in the book that a pinned opponent cannot move or take any actions, but not that it's helpless, thought that seems pretty much the same thing, huh? What do you think on these two, how would you change them?
> **Unarmed Disarm** - Needs a useage limit, and also seems very overpowered, given the very difficult normal rules for disarming.

1/encounter? Also, I forgot to mention, this talent ONLY works if you are not holding anything in your hands.
> All in all, the class seems good, if somewhat overpowered. It seems a bit misplaced in the SW universe though. You may wish to consider things like what if someone uses Unarmed Disarm when someone tries to use their gun as a club?

Exactly. ^^ I'm really going for more of an Assassin's Creed feel than a Star Wars one, though obviously it still needs to be a Star Wars setting. As to the gun club thing, my answer would be, the idiot that tried to melee me with a gun loses his gun. ^^

### **Tempeste** (2009-12-02 14:23:11)

I honestly think having a full class is unessecary, maybe just afew talent trees would be a better idea. That said, there needs to be a good disarm talent for use when fighting defensively with no weapons? Perhaps with a secondary talent which makes the target flat footed to your next attack after you disarm then.
EG/ When fighting defensively and attacked by an opponent with a melee weapon, you may opt to make a disarm attempt. You must have both hands free and be aware of the attack to do this. You must make an opposed Initiative skill check with a -5 to your total, if you beat your opponent then you disarm them, and take their weapon. You may then use the weapon as normal on your next turn. (Could be attack rolls rather than initative.. And could also be a roll against their attack roll rather than an opposed skill check.)
Talent two/ If you succesfully disarm an opponent, they are classed as being flatfooted until the end of your next turn.

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-12-02 22:58:16)

I'd like to finish work on balancing the class as soon as we can, because once we're done with it, I'm ready to post a casting call. Tempeste, I'm not too clear on what you're saying. Could you maybe restate it somehow?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-12-03 03:08:32)

I´m getting that you´re basing this off the AC games, but I just wanted to point out that some things might be out of place in a SW setting. What I meant by the gun club example was that its effect differs a lot between the settings. In AC, the effect is pretty much that now you have a weapon, and they don´t. In SW, this could mean that now you have a ranged weapon, and that can make a huge difference. For example, you rush the soldier with a heavy repeater, he decides to bash you with it, and wham. Now you have a heavy repeater, not only very unsettling for him, but also for his allies some distance away.
For the equipment, I´d just say leave it as it is. It already gains a good bonus to hiding from being so small. And the ability to draw it faster is already in place with the Quick Draw template.
**Assasinate** - I meant Galaxy at War, one of the later books, that had a whole talent tree on ambushing. But now that I think of the whole talent, how about this: You can use the Snipe application of the Stealth skill with melee weapons.
**Blend/b] - I get what its doing, I just think its unclear when you can use it. What is "a crowd of unsuspecting people". Since it gives Stealth bonuses, I´d say the crowd has to be pretty big, otherwise it could just work like the Blend In talent(Force Unleashed). Actually, if the goal is to make you seem less suspicious, rather than vanishing completely, that talent would seem a better choice.
**Gentle Push** - I paid a quick visit to an AC FAQ, and it seems to me like the "Gentle Push" thing, is an actual physical push, which makes Persuasion seem quite irrelevant to me. One way to do it is to say that you don´t treat a crowded area as difficult terrain, which I think it normally is.
**Combat Dodge** - It would be less overpowered with a lower number, yes, but you should still compare it to other abilities. Most abilities that grants such a huge RD bonus requires high levels and PrCs to get, this one can be had at level 1.
**Leap of Faith** - I think having a set DC for halving falling damage is wrong way to go. I´d say that this talent could reduce the DC for the Jump check for Jumping Down by 5, or maybe increase the amount of squares subtracted for every 5 points you beat the DC.
**Counter** - Yeah, Riposte is a little restrictive, but I do think there´s some testing behind it. But I´ve also though of houseruling it to once per turn.
**Improved Counter** - I´m still not sure about this. Making a character flat-footed is quite a big deal if your character is built to fight that way, and doing it once per turn, without requiring a skill check or anyhing seems to be too good.
**Skilled Duelist** - Well, it depends on what you want out of it. I think "skilled dueslist" rhymes ill with a guy using a massive vibroaxe, but it might just be me. Also, IIRC, most abilities that does similar things are PrC only.
**Capture/Execute** - I´d say that Capture allows a character you have used the Pin feat on to provide you with soft cover, and that Execute can allow you to make a Coup the Grace on a Pinned character as a Full-Round action(as normal).
**Unarmed Disarm** - 1/encounter could work.**

---

### **Tempeste** (2009-12-03 08:03:37)

I think some of those talents could just be extensions of skills. Blend for example could go in the Stealth skill (Or maybe even deception) as a trained only option. Leap of faith could go into Jump (making the skill slightly more useful)
The second part of my last posts are examples of how I think the disarm talent should work.

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-12-03 09:22:33)

Hm. Ok, some interesting points. Temp, I like your version of the disarm talent, but I'm wondering what restrictions you would put on it? 1/per encounter? 1/turn? Anyway, I'll get to that in a minute.
> Assasinate - I meant Galaxy at War, one of the later books, that had a whole talent tree on ambushing. But now that I think of the whole talent, how about this: You can use the Snipe application of the Stealth skill with melee weapons.
> Blend/b] - I get what its doing, I just think its unclear when you can use it. What is &quot;a crowd of unsuspecting people&quot;. Since it gives Stealth bonuses, I´d say the crowd has to be pretty big, otherwise it could just work like the Blend In talent(Force Unleashed). Actually, if the goal is to make you seem less suspicious, rather than vanishing completely, that talent would seem a better choice.

Ok, but I don't own Galaxy at War *or* The Force Unleashed. Can you summarize what the talents you're talking about do? Also, as to the sniping part, that would only be a standard attack and technically you could do it with any weapon by your write up. Mine is written so it's only doable with the Assassin's Blade, which you're much more likely to be able to avoid notice with.
> **Gentle Push - I paid a quick visit to an AC FAQ, and it seems to me like the &quot;Gentle Push&quot; thing, is an actual physical push, which makes Persuasion seem quite irrelevant to me. One way to do it is to say that you don´t treat a crowded area as difficult terrain, which I think it normally is.**

Ok, this makes sense. We'll go ahead and use that then. Just to clarify though, the persuasion check was because you're not really forcefully pushing them out of the way, you're giving them a gentle push that tells them "oh, this guy wants by me."
> Combat Dodge - It would be less overpowered with a lower number, yes, but you should still compare it to other abilities. Most abilities that grants such a huge RD bonus requires high levels and PrCs to get, this one can be had at level 1.

Hm... So maybe a +2 or +3 and a few prereqs on it other than dodge, then?
> Leap of Faith - I think having a set DC for halving falling damage is wrong way to go. I´d say that this talent could reduce the DC for the Jump check for Jumping Down by 5, or maybe increase the amount of squares subtracted for every 5 points you beat the DC.

That does make sense, having it increase the squares per 5 points.
> Improved Counter - I´m still not sure about this. Making a character flat-footed is quite a big deal if your character is built to fight that way, and doing it once per turn, without requiring a skill check or anyhing seems to be too good.

Hm... Maybe if it requires your attack roll to beat their attack roll by 5 or more, or something like that?
> Skilled Duelist - Well, it depends on what you want out of it. I think &quot;skilled dueslist&quot; rhymes ill with a guy using a massive vibroaxe, but it might just be me. Also, IIRC, most abilities that does similar things are PrC only.

That's a good point. Hm... A thought occurs. Maybe I should scrap the current write-up for it and have it do something like... "You may use the Weapon Finesse feat with medium weapons." What do you think?
> Capture/Execute - I´d say that Capture allows a character you have used the Pin feat on to provide you with soft cover, and that Execute can allow you to make a Coup the Grace on a Pinned character as a Full-Round action(as normal).

Alright, I'll change that momentarily.
> I think some of those talents could just be extensions of skills. Blend for example could go in the Stealth skill (Or maybe even deception) as a trained only option. Leap of faith could go into Jump (making the skill slightly more useful)

Well, I would agree except then they'd be available to anyone, not just the Assassins.
> When fighting defensively and attacked by an opponent with a melee weapon, you may opt to make a disarm attempt. You must have both hands free and be aware of the attack to do this. You must make an opposed Initiative skill check with a -5 to your total, if you beat your opponent then you disarm them, and take their weapon. You may then use the weapon as normal on your next turn. (Could be attack rolls rather than initative.. And could also be a roll against their attack roll rather than an opposed skill check.)

This makes sense. If we went with this version, where you must be fighting defensively, would it still need the 1/encounter restriction? What do you think, Thrax?

### **Tempeste** (2009-12-03 14:54:06)

Having Blend as an extension of a skill would make it available to more than just assassins, but it's not really a unique skill that takes years of practice so I don't see why it should be limited to just an assassin.
For the disarm, I think that because you have to be fighting defensively there doesn't need to be any other restrictions. Because you're lowering your attack capabilities in order to just attempt a disarm. But i'd make it once per turn so you can't disarm all 8 cultists who've surrounded you in one turn.. would be odd.

Ok, that works for me. Unless Anthrax or anyone else disagrees, I think we'll use your version, Temp.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-12-04 14:55:25)

**Assassinate** - I can´t remember how they were written, and I don´t have access to my books, but they were pretty good.
**Blend** - It allows you to use your Stealth modifier instead of Deception to create a deceptive appearance. Basically a very good representation of blending into a crowd IMO.
**Combat Dodge** - That would be more balanced, but a little borng :P
**Improved Counter** - I´d go with spending a Force Point.
**Skilled Duelist/b] - It depends entirely on what you want with it.**

---

### **zenkatarn** (2009-12-05 14:01:09)

Ok, that should about do it then, unless I'm mistaken. I'll try to get the casting call up in the next few days.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2009-12-08 13:38:10)

Shouldn't the hit points be 24, not 28?

Why?

Why?
Because starting hit points are always three times the maximum value of the class hit die. Scoundrel and Noble are d6 with 18 hp at 1st, Jedi and Soldier are d10 with 30 hp at 1st, and the Fringer is d8 with 24. It's simple and elegant and there's no reason to make this class the single exception.

Ah. See, I didn't know that. Alright, I'll fix it now.
