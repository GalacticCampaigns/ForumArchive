# Simulating Training (rule?)

### **Anonymous** (2008-04-30 17:40:13)

**Background**: In Hearts of Shadows campaign, I discussed with the GM (Dreamwalker) about how my character could simulate learning a feat, which did not exist. The feat was a Force Treatment replacement for Cybernetic Surgery. The feat would be a surgery that would allow the patient to regenerate (like a Trandoshian) over a period of days. I am tryng to expand on those thoughts and make it more general rule to be used in games. Especially, since, my character is teaching some force sensitives how to use the force.
**Problem**: When you level up, you get feats/talents. Most games just assume you have been learning in the background.
**Synopsis**: Below are two ideas on how to simulate trying to learn a new skill, talent, or feat. They could also be used to show the process of a new house or published feat. That way, people can pick and choose feats from a variety of sources, but, bringing it into the game takes the character time.
**Idea 1: DC modification**
You can pick a feat, when you level. But, like a med student needs to perform a residency, you have to get more experience to be â€˜fully qualifiedâ€™. Having the feat allows you to try all the things the feat would allow you to do. You still succeed, if you beat the DC for the task. But, to learn and retain something significant, you have to beat the DC by 5. Each of the +5 successes, gives you +1 learning point. And the GM determines how many learning points are required to be considered â€˜fully qualifiedâ€™.
If the training is taken before, you have spent a slot for the feat, you have an additional +5 to the DC.
*Optional:* Instead of succeeding on the normal DC, the higher DC is needed to succeed. This is to simulate, that you are not only focused on succeeding at the task at hand, but, also learning and retaining this knowledge.
**Idea 2: Training Track**
There is a training track, similar to the condition track. Except, the training track starts with the -10 to skill checks and works its way up to no penalties or fully trained. This Training Track penalty is applied to the roll to achieve the feat/talent/skill. The GM decide, when you have made enough successes to go up a step on the Training Track. And, spending/allocating a slot with a feat, increases your training track condition by 1 or 2.
**Applies to both ideas**
If you have had enough successes, using either of the methods above, you are free to add the feat anytime in the future and use it as fully qualified.
**Summary**
I would like otherâ€™s to evaluate these methods and which way would be best. Any suggestions to improve or expand on either idea would be greatly appreciated.

I noticed no answer to this one. I'd like to weigh in. I don't think you should add more rules on choosing feats or talents. If you want it to make game sense, then I'd suggest that you speak with your players and let them know. Role play the training sessions before they level up to show that they've been learning to use the new feat/ talent/ Force power, etc. But, once they've got it, I'd say they're trained and ready to roll. K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid), no offense to anyone or anything, it's just a statement I like. I've got a player who wants the tiniest change in game play (I'm kneeling, doesn't that add a bonus to my Defense? I have knowledge (tactics), don't I get a benefit for aiding my friends in combat?) and I constantly throw that anagram at him to get him to stop. I don't like adding rules for no good reason. I think the system works pretty well as is.
