# Move Object Problems...

### **Anonymous** (2008-02-12 07:22:03)

I'm having difficulty with Move Object being so easy to take out key characters in battle.
At only 4th level he has a +16 UtF skill which is pretty much as high as you can go unless he had the scoundrel talent to raise it by +5.
That all aside, my encounters are balanced and they seemed to have a fair amount of difficulties with the other enemies and such, but there is still a problem.
According to the rules,
You can target One character or object within 6 squares or within line of sight. Line of sight is across the battle field so pretty much anyone you can see.
You make your UtF check, which in his case he automatically can move a medium creature.
So the Jedi uses Move Object on the Leader of the Thug using the thugs Will defense as his DC.
At 4th level the enemies they go up against have fairly weak Will Def, even the ones that have good Will Def are no match for +16 UtF.
Besides using other Force User Characters, Droids and other Creatures with high Will resistance or even immunity what else can I throw at him to stop the abuse of that tactic?
Or is there any errata that I missed. The only errata for Move Object that I have is if you use the power to deal damage with an object the power ceases.

You might want to consider a circumstantial bonus. If you don't want something to happen because it's ruining game play put your foot down. Talk to the player if you need to and tell him how you feel about this tactic. If a creature has an unusually high will defense for the level and unless the roll was unusually high (you can start treating the UtF check as trained only knocking it down to +11) then only the lowest effect may happen.
That's just my 2 cents of how I would handle this.
Is he the only Jedi in the group? Only Force user?

What's he doing with the thug, now that he's lifted up in the air? If the thug is mentally "grappled" that would a be an opposed roll, which is a little harder to do. This result might also require a roll based off BAB and intelligence, to properly use the hundreds of tons of force he's manipulating.
If the Jedi is just picking him up (and not grappled), the thug can still shoot. How hard is it to see the only guy making hand waving motions? Plus, lifting some one up in the air identifies you as a Force User/Jedi...and now your preoccupied doing some heavy lifting. Coordinated fire anyone?
Is he slamming people into wall or dropping them in chasms or other wise dealing damage? Dark Side point. He wants to spend a Force Point to get rid of it? Sounds good. He did it again? Another Dark Side point. He wants to spent another Force Point to remove the Dark Side taint? Oh, I don't think he's really repenting, if he's making a habit of this...
Also, remember the thug is a mook, a red shirt. Mooks and Red Shirts re there to make the heroes look cool. If he falls to the Jedi's Move Object ability, he should fall to the Soldier Heavy Blaster Rifle set to stun (or kill) just as easily. If this is not true (the Jedi is over shadowing the rest of the heroes) *then* you have a real issue.

Not gonna happen, stun is nerfed. I haven't seen it work as it's meant to once yet: Not once has the pitiful one die less than usual stun damage beaten a damage threshold, and the actual damage if it fails is even more pitiful once it's halved. I'm considering increasing stun damage to match regular damage in my games (it would still be halved, but it might have a better chance of beating the damage threshold and doing condition damage), just so that my players start reconsidering it as a serious option and don't have to kill everyone they fight.
On the subject of Move Object itself, your player can automatically move a medium creature. Okay. For 2d6 damage, not a big problem. A roll is required for anything higher. However, if it still seems too easy, the easiest fix is probably just to up every DC by 5. As Breeder mentioned, there should also be potential consequences for treating a living creature like a ragdoll in the form of Dark Side Points. Ask the player to be very specific with how they want to use the power.
Finally, here's some creative interpretation of the rules that might also help take the edge off:
[ul]
[*]Move Object requires a Use the Force check versus the target's Will Defense.  
[ul][*]Targeting a Defense, ipso facto, makes said Use the Force check an attack as well as a skill check, and the former state would seem to override the latter.  
[*]Attacks automatically fail on a roll of "1". Therefore, uses of the Force that target a Defense can also fail on a roll of "1".  
[*]However, uses of the Force cannot deal critical damage, since higher degrees of damage potential are already built in to the skill checks of such powers. Two systems to achieve the same thing aren't necessary and would be broken in conjunction.[/ul][/ul]  
If you implement the above rule the following powers automatically fail on a roll of "1": Farseeing, Force Disarm, Force Grip, Force Lightning, Force Slam, Force Stun, Mind Trick, Move Object, and Sever Force.

I thought that got fixed in the errata...
(Checks)
Yeah. Here is what I found:
> **p. 126-127 â€“ p. 120 &ndash; Weapon Qualities**
> The entry for Stun Damage should read as follows:
> &quot;If the weapon has a stun setting, it is listed here. A weapon set to stun does stun damage equal to its normal damage (see Stunning, page 162, for more information). Ranged weapons set to stun have a maximum range of 6 squares unless noted otherwise.&quot;
> **p. 126-127 &ndash; Table 8-4: Ranged Weapons**
> All damage entries in the &quot;Stun&quot; column of the table should be replaced with the word &quot;Yes.&quot;
> Blaster carbines should deal 3d6 damage.

Or were you thinking of upping the damage of stun one more die? I would be cool with that.
Back to topic: even back in the d6 days, telekinesis was an "I win" button for Jedi. Never in a game have I seen the effort to use Move Object like I saw in the movies. The closest I ever saw of a 'fast' move object was Darth Maul with his opening of a door, and the various force powered impacts all the Jedi's got hit with through out the prequels. Luke levitating rock, Yoda moving a X-wing (and whatever Dooku dropped on Anikin and Obwan) required visible, definite concentration, to the exclusion of anything else. But you won't see that in a game; it's just not *uber*.
Unless, of course, you put it there...

I wasn't aware of that errata (I don't often check errata files because I find it easier to remember my own houserules than I do later changes by the designers), but it's useful to know.
As for increasing by one more die, I'd not be totally against the idea. but I'd think that might cross the line into overpowered and would want to test it. Also, from a purely logical point of view, I'd imagine it's easier to burn a hole in someone than it is to stun their nervous systems, so if either mode should have increased power it should be regular damage (which is probably the line of thought the designers initially took).

The whole I'm using a skill check to attack someones Willpower is overbalanced, it wasn't bad because these guys were red shirts, but I foresee problems. I don't want to have all my encounters defeated by move object. I'm trying to find balance.
The creature was large and threatening, he had every reason to stop it and it was trying to get past him.
He did everything correct, no dark side points were issued.
He used the Yuzzem as a shield from the Yuzzem human thugs,and then he threw the Yuzzem at the thugs.
Again, when the leader Yuzzem was piloting an air speeder away they became engaged in a dogfight. The mask menace was also in the speeder. He moved object on the masked menace, and he moved object on the Yezzem, letting them fall to there death in the dangerous swamp below. Which was all for the greater good since they kidnapped a noble daughter who was pregnant and unconscious in the speeder.
I guess my question is comes down to this...
If he uses the Move Object to grab and hold a creature, should there be an opposed grapple roll. The creature using normal grapple checks (with size bonus modifiers etc), and the force-user using UtF checks?

I donÂ´t think the rules call for a grapple check of any kind.
However, I find it weird that he could completely use the creature as a shield against the other enemies. What was the terrain like?
Move Object gets *much* harder to maintain while under heavy fire. And those thugs should focus on the Force user once they see their leader fly high in the air, probably use Aid another to ensure solid hits.

See, there's a GM problem right here (at least IMO). If the speeder has a Yuzzem, a "masked menace", and an unconscious pregnant woman on board, removing both of the first two removes both of the potential pilots. Meaning the speeder is liable to crash and result in a grisly death for an innocent party and her unborn child. Resulting in not just one, but potentially several, dark side points.

Let me set up the scene-
A massacre just occurred in the noble suites lounge at Rifter Arena, the players use a damaged lift the the peek level where the chaos is ensuing. The Yuzzem and "Masked Menace" take the high road to the top level where the private landing platform is located while the players over come twelve droids that mimic the "masked menace" cloak and mask clothing. Demolition expert Yuzzem has set and continues to set charges to blow up all remaining vehicles on the private platform.
The heroes escape the assassin droids after taking heavy damage and almost completely tapped of force powers. The climatic vehicle chase from the landing pad to the planet skies. Below is swamplands, and a thick swamp gas mist that is toxic to humans and some non-humans which hides the planets surface. They are engaged in a dogfight, the modified air speeder with luxury interior obviously stolen by the thugs, three support speeder bikes armed with laser cannons, and our heroes in a similar luxurious speeder with detonate charges on a countdown, and one hero manage to overcome one of the thugs and take his speeder on the platform before he took off, so hes on a speeder identical to the other three thugs.
High enough in the air where after the Yuzzem and Masked Menace disappeared in the swamp mist the speeder when into safe mode. The speeder went into cruise mode in a straight line and started to fall drastically. The heroes piloted to match the the speed of the falling speeder and hoped on piloting avoiding the crash.
I don't think that's unreasonable, and if they wanted to they could have use Move Object (if they wanted to burn a Force Point) to get the unconscious pregnant women, or stop the hole speeder.

I think so, yes. But then you have the issue of using Move Object on space craft. Yoda (Use Force +24) would have truly difficult time moving the X-wing (grapple +33) and Luke would have failed right from the get go (granted the X-wing was turned off, and merely stalled in the mud). The guy from that new Star Wars game coming out simple could not drag that miniature Star Destroyer out of the sky.
Current rules include spending a Force Point to increase the maximum size of object you can effect to Colossal (frigate). If you instituted a grapple check to oppose it, that ability would be pointless (as long as the ship was under power) as most capital ships have a grapple check ranging from +48 to +80 something (there is one that grapples at +194...).
Now, I do see Move Object as an automatic "I win" button for the Jedi (or other Force User), and I'm all for limiting it, but anyone who does needs to be aware of the repercussions.
Look at the story basis for it. Say Mickey the Jedi uses Move Object on Debra the Force Pike Fiend. They're battling in an empty hall way with a few hand hold. How exactly does Debra resist? Grab the wall? Doesn't she have to drop her pike for that? drive the pike into the ground, and and hold on for dear life? She's still out of combat. Say she draws her blaster pistol and shoots Mickey. Is a stage or two down the condition track enough to really change anything?
What about that grapple check? A 4th level Soldier with a 22 strength has a grapple check of...+10. What are the chances a melee dedicated- a *grapple* dedicated soldier can stand up to a 18 charisma force user (with trained and Skill Focus, total check around...whole, +16. What do ya know?) in a move object grapple?
It might be an idea to split Move Object into two different powers- one for people, and one for non-living things. At least then Force Users will need to buy twice the number of power for the same amount of cheese.

IÂ´d say it is, since the damage would (most likely) break her concentration and end the power. So at least MickeyÂ´d have to spend another instance of it. And if heÂ´s out, then too bad for him.
