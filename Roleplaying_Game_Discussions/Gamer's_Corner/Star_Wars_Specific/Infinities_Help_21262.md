# Infinities Help

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-13 16:38:48)

I'm currently crafting an infinities campaign, and though I am mostly done, I'm wondering if I can get any advice.
The basic premise is that at some point during the "canon" story, Mace Windu, along with most of the Jedi Council, turned dark. With Anakin's aid, Mace eliminated Palpatine before his plans could come into effect. After this, he took control of the Senate, "for the greater good." Obi-Wan discovered this, and along with a redeemed Count Dooku(who Anakin spared in this universe) fled, eventually founding something close to the rebellion.
Thus the stage is set. There are four main sides: The Jedi(Headed by Mace Windu. Most masters are dark, but many padawans and even a few knights are ignorant to this), The Republic(Headed by Chancellor Bail Organa, who is simply a puppet of the Jedi Council), Obi-Wan's rebels(Headed by Obi-Wan and Dooku, a small amount of Jedi, with a few more non-force using troops headed by Thrawn[just thought it would be interesting]), and the CIS(Palpatine never sent Anakin to wipe them out. Headed by Tarkin, with IG-88 as an ally/second in comand). So its Jedi vs. Obi-Wan's Jedi and Republic vs. Seperatists.
Any advise would be appreciated. A specific question: what exactly should I call the rebel Jedi?

Well, for your rebel Jedi, you could just call them the Rebels. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
Or, you could steal a name straight from Wookieepedia, like this:
> Many ancient and semi-legendary organizations have been proposed to be the forerunners of the Jedi Order, including the Order of Dai Bendu, the Followers of Palawa, and the Chatos Academy.

Any one of those three could work, if you like how they sound.
Oh, and the game sounds like a blast.

After looking up some info on Wookiepedia, I kinda like the sound of the Paladins of the Chatos Academy.
Thanks Mo(you don't mind if I call you Mo, do you?), for both the idea and the praise.

Nah, my real nickname is Mo, so it's all good.
