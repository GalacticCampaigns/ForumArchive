# Origin of the Star Wars Galaxy

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-05-30 20:19:09)

Hey everyone...what's going on? I haven't posted on here for a while but I have a question that pertains to my upcoming campaign. Just where can you trace the origins of the Star Wars galaxy back to? Does it have a story like Genesis? It's important that I know because it will affect how my storyline turns out. Thank you.

Ever read this fan fiction?

It's pretty good.

From what I could gather, the Big Bang theory holds strong in the SW Galaxy as well. CouldnÂ´t find much info about it though, but maybe this link can help.

Thanks. Well since there isn't a whole lot on the Big Bang theory...I'm going to add some stuff to make it more interesting, for the sake of my plot anyways.
