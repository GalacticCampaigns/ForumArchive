# Species Stats Help for new member of my party play

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-31 14:17:47)

I need the stats for the Frozian and Vodran species. I located a good SAGA conversion site, but for ability mods it states they are the same as before. Well, I don't own the d20 species book and I was hoping someone could clue me in as far as their ability stats (dex, wis, etc.) If anyone could help me out I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.
