# NPC creation

### **Rowen** (2008-08-28 08:36:35)

The one thing I always have problems with (and this include making PC too) is NPC creation. I seem to always leave out something. Or not add in a defense boost or a plus to my initiative, or something.
Do you fellow GM's have a system you use to make sure you don't forget to add something (yes Im looking at you Simply and Darthanthrax lol). I'm always in a page flipping contest looking for all the values. I'm not sure its just because I don't make enough or if I'm going about it all wrong.
Please share your wisdom with me. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Oh my, someone is asking me to impart wisdom... <!-- s:? -->![:?](https://i.ibb.co/KcdH3QwT/icon-e-confused.gif)<!-- s:? -->
Well, I canÂ´t say that I use any special tricks, other than that I maybe tries to be very thorough when I stat a character. For instance, I never stat more than one level at a time. And whenever something happends that would change a value in a field, I immediately do so.
For example, when I increase the level of a character, the first thing I do is always to increase defenses, BaB & Grapple (and all related attack options). If I raised to a even-numbered level, all skills and damages goes up.
If I added a new class, class bonuses always go in right away, along with starting feats and a talent.
When adding a feat or talent, I always increase everything that increases as a result immediately.
When gaining a stat up that makes a stat even, I always increases everything that increases as a result of that right away.
And so on...

I have a excel program that I made that helps keep me on track. It's not as extensive as Kenad's for example but it's a nice way to double check the basic things.

I had the same problem, but after a while, I made fewer and fewer mistakes. I ended up developing a pattern, and began to reconize what this or that stat or modifier should be. One or two points in attack or damage does not make that big of a difference.
The only issue I got is balancing what I created to the party. For example, I created a four armed three headed troll. According to the CR, it should have been tough, but defeatible with causing too many problems. It ended up with the ability to kill two PC's a turn.
I'm better now.

My issue comes down to NPC non heroics and then the big bad in the game and his lackies. I made a template via microsoft word and just build the big bad the same way I would make a hero. Giving the same advantages towards them as I do the players. Meaning bonus feats and skills at creation to even the field. Seems to me that most times the players are able to kill the NPCs in a single encounter and don't give a rip about dialouge or even looking for information most of the time. So I just make sure the big bad in my games is a step ahead of them until the end battle were the field is even for everyone. And if need be spend a destiny point to flee the scene <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
