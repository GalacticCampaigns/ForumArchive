# Great Lightsaber

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-13 16:02:22)

I'm interested in the great lightsaber. Under the old rules it did the same damage as the regular lightsaber (2d8). However, in SAGA the short lightsaber does 2d6 and the regular lightsaber does 2d8. Size matters. I'd assume the great lightsaber would do 2d10 damage, but I wanted other people's opinion on the matter. Thanks.

Nope, 2d8. This prevents "lightsaber twinks" from using it just for the extra damage. It does grant you a 1 square reach though, and I remove the resriction that it can't strike adjacent targets, and replace it with a small attack penalty to do so. We are after all talking about a blade of pure energy.... it's going to do damage no matter what part of the blade you strike with....

That can't be construed as evidence to support you, I'm afraid. The short lightsaber used six-sided dice too in the RCR too (If you don't believe me, check the errata document).

But there's already a penalty for any creature smaller than large using the weapon if I'm not mistaken. I think that should be adequate and plausible prevention for anyone just wanting to roll bigger dice. Especially since the great lightsaber can be almost 10 ft. long! The penalty should be steep, in terms of use, for any medium size character. For large creatures the great lightsaber makes sense.

Ah, but the very fact that the smaller lightsaber does less damage supports a larger than normal lightsaber doing more damage. I think They Call Me Bob pinpoints the real reason the 2d8 is established by the designers in the old rule system. Wanting to keep people from having a too powerful weapon. The problem is that their own design of damage difference between small and regular lightsabers destroys that conceit. If smaller does less under the mechanics, than larger should logically do more. And it isn't plausible: The great lightsaber's blade can be up to almost 10ft long and as thick as my arm. It would do considerable more damage. I stick by adding a steep penalty for non-large creatures using it and give a 2d10 since it's the next size die. That would fit with the mechanics established in both game systems. Would you do it differently in your games and why? Is there some giant trap I'd be falling into that I can't see?

Not really. I'm inclined to agree with you from a purely numerical standpoint, I was just pointing out that the "size matters" argument doesn't hold true in the official WotC view of things.
However, there is one in-setting logic I can see for keeping things the way they are you should at least consider.
That being a matter of contact area/damage potential. The shoto is in fact a very small 'saber, so is likely to have a lot less contact with the target. The burn/cut it inflicts will therefore be, in most cases, less harmful. Even though the greatsaber is larger than a lightsaber, it doesn't necessarily follow that it will do more damage despite the above logic. Consider the size of a lightsaber, and that it is already optimised for lethality, able to cut creatures of medium size or smaller clean in two and easily able to reach a larger creature's vitals. A greatsaber's extra length then doesn't necessarily improve on its lethality, it's more a question of overkill. If a greatsaber truly was more effective than a lightsaber, all jedi would use them.

Alright, my turn.
It's generally assumed that no matter how big a light saber looks, it's only a millimeter (some say a few molecules) thick, and the rest of the stuff is just glow and light. So, it's not as big as your arm.
A great saber was a specially designed saber whose blade was merely longer than a normal saber. When these weapons cut through bulk heads, the designers probably figured they had amp'ed up the damage quality just fine. So far, there are so few materials out there that can stop a lightsaber (when correct force is applied) that ther eis no reason to make the plasma filled, magnetic field any hotter.
So, 2d8.
Now, some lazy jedi out there thought to himself "I wanna chop that guy's arms off, but he is way over there, on the other side of the room, and I am seated comfortably in this chair..." So, he figured out how to make a lightsaber with a lot longer blade(likely a bigger handle, as well).
Why didn't this style of lightsaber catch on? Because it's a 3 meter blade, that's why. That's about four to five feet over you head, should the handle be resting on the ground. Holding it like a normal lightsaber, and it's seven to eight feet over your head. This makes using it nigh-impossible, for practical applications. Over head chops are fine, side to side chops are fine (provided, of course, there isn't anything else in the way, like you friends). Anything below the belt...nope. The ground will get in the way. So those neat twirls and flips and jumps without chopping you leg off, fighting next to some one, fighting in a hall way, fighting under any roof, deflecting shots that are below your waist, blocking strikes under your waist? Nope, not happening. You need some thing manageable for that.
You want a reach weapon without being silly? Take a two meter staff, and put a light saber at the end of it. Use it like a pole arm. You want an excuse to have bigger damage die? Add a few more focusing crystals, hook the hilt up to a power generator, and go to town. Just remember not to unplug the cord.

No, there isn't. It's simply a two handed weapon for a Medium character. There is a penalty for a character smaller than Medium using it though, or a Medium character using it one-handed.
Think of the Great Lightsaber as a DnD style polearm: It has reach. You can attack targets up to X squares away from you, but not adjacent targets. Now, in DnD polearms don't grant any additional bonus damage. Most do 2d6 or 2d8, on par with other two handed weapons. I'm not looking at the book right now, so I can't give you exact figures.
There are basically two two-handed melee weapons in Saga: Force Pike and Vibro-Axe. One does 2d8, the other does 2d10. Now, the Force Pike has the lower damage because it also has a Stun Setting, which gives it the advantage over the Vibro Axe.
The Lightsaber does 2d8. The Great Lightsaber has an advantage over it in that it has reach. Therefore, it's not really balanced to give it higher damage.
Most reach weapons cannot be used to attack adjacent targets according to RAW. If you remove that restriction, the Great Lightsaber can then do 2d8 to adjacent targets, and targets up to 2 squares away. Significant advantage.

Personally I don't think short lightsabers should be 2d6, but rather 2d8 just like a normal saber. Its a blade of energy, you don't need you have a heavier thicker blade to do more damage it cuts through any material the same as a normal size lightsaber. I often feel that was a developer flaw, lightsabers should all do the same amount of damage. Anything made using lightsaber technology should do the same amount of damage.
That's just my opinion...

Not strictly true. Yes, it deals damage at the same rate, but length/surface area is a factor. Take a piece of card and two pairs of scissors, one longer than the other. Cut into the card with both. The longer pair of scissors has done more damage to the card.

Your using a physical damage example, I can retort and say. Take two laser beams of energy and take a piece of card and move the beams across the card from opposite ends.
I see what your saying **simplyscribed.** If fact, I'm not arguing that point. That's why I referred to the example of a heavier thicker blade, as if you were using a steel blade, but we are talking about an beam of energy. I guess you can say that the beam of energy is not equal up and down the sabre just like a katana. In that case, the larger sabre has a more damage inflicting area. I guess I see both sides, and just stick with the books suggested retail damage.
Like I said, Personally I don't see a difference, because the size of a short, medium and large lightsabre relatively does not seem big enough to make a damage difference. Now, if we make the beam lets say as big as the Death Star.. hehe.. well then I must concede.

Personally, I hate the idea of a great saber, and what's worse, one that switches between normal form and "great saber" form. Whoever thought of that never spent much thought about actually *using* it.
Anyhow, rant aside, if you look at D&D (ya know, the base from which Saga was built?) a normal longsword does d8. A longsword built for a Yoda sized creature does d6, while one built for a hutt deals 2d6 (which is a strange leap, but the bastard sword- sort of a half-way sword- deals d10, and that needs it's special place). Take a long sword blade, and mount it on a long stick (give it reach) and the damage is the same, but has the benefits of reach, plus a beanie (+2 to trip or disarm). Or the weapon deals d10, has no beanies, and still has reach (less than a two handed sword's damage, but hey, it's got reach). So, going by this loose logic, any light saber with reach would deal damage as a normal lightsaber.
Now, if you were to make a lightsaber made for a hutt to use comfortably, and took advantage of the extra room in a handle that big, then sure, you could up the damage. But why would a order of philosopher-monks (interested only in prompting peace) want a **wavy stick of doom** to be even *more* lethal?
