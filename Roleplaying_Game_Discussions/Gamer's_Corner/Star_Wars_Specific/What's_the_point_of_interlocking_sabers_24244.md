# What's the point of interlocking sabers?

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-27 13:14:43)

Here's a question to ask of the great minds of our time. Namely, what's the difference between a double lightsaber and two seperate lightsabers? I understand the difference from a role-play perspective, but not in the game mechanics. The double lightsaber is treated as two separate weapons when both blades are ignited, so no difference that I am aware of, mechanically. The only difference that I am aware of is that a double lightsaber is a large weapon while two normal lightsabers are both medium weapons.
This has been bothering me since I got my hands on the Jedi Academy Training Manual. Page 60 gives the lightsaber accessory of the interlocking hilt, allowing a Jedi to wield two sabers, and then turn them into one double saber. The book says that locking two sabers together would make them into a single weapon of one size larger than the original two weapons. Thus, two shotos become a medium sized double saber, two normal sabers become a large sized double saber, two long handled sabers become a huge sized double saber (don't really want to imagine the Jedi using that).
My question, is why bother? What's the point of my character installing interlocking handles on his two single sabers and turning them into a double saber? The mechanics, as I understand them, would treat the weapon the exact same way, except that maybe now I can be completely disarmed with one action as opposed to two separate for two sabers.
I do have a thought as to that, though. Would two normal sabers, interlocked but only activated from one side, be a long-handled lightsaber? I ask because a double lightsaber is a large sized weapon, just as is a long-handled lightsaber. And, if activated from a single side only, it would seem, to me, to follow the rules of the long-handled saber, that is, forgoing the double strength bonus for wielding it two handed in exchange for a step up on the dice size (d8 to d10).
If this seems to make sense, then two shotos (d4) interlocked would become a medium sized saber, though less powerful (d6).
I'm asking this because I was wondering why my dual-saber wielding Jedi would ever bother with interlocking sabers, as I've seen in numerous stories and comics. Thanks for the help.

Well, the double-bladed lightsaber can benefit from twice your Strength mod when you roll damage since you're wielding it with two hands. That's pretty delicious.
There's also the purely roleplaying aspect - do you or your character think a double lightsaber is looks cool? Then who cares what benefits it has, it LOOKS COOL.
RAW, the long-handed 'saber thing doesn't work. While you could still benefit from getting double your Strength bonus, you wouldn't have the option of improved damage dice that the long-handled saber gets. Why? Because two interlocked sabers are treated as a double-ended one. There is already allowance in the description of the latter weapon to say that it can be used with only one blade ignited, but no additional mechanical effects are mentioned.

To add to why they wonÂ´t have mechanical changes, you are simply using some mechanic clasp tp put them together (duct tape would work as well I suppose...a lot of it), but nothing that lets them take advantage of the other weapons power source, focusing mechanics, etc.
The benefits of an interlocking hilt is mostly in roleplaying, but some mechanical aspects there are as well. As you say, you can now be completely disarmed in a single attack, but you also get a +5 against being disarmed as you now hold the weapon in two hands. And as said, you also would get the doubled Strength bonus.
Then there are roleplaying aspects that could have mechanical benefits with some houseruling. As a GM, I would probably allow you to make a feint against an adjacent foe as part of the Swift action used to separate the hilts the first time you do it in an encounter. Boc Aseca tended to have to sabers interlocked, making them seem like an unusually thick lightsaber, something he used to surprise his opponents.

I don't know the exact rules behind it, but with the interlocking mechanism, as well as the assortment of gems, you could have a double lightsaber with two different blades (ie: having a sigil crystal and a solari crystal). At least, that's my take on it.

And of course if an ally loses their lightsaber, you can detach yours and give them one saber whilst keeping one for yourself. You can't do that with a regular double bladed lightsaber.

I've heard tell of this concept. Some people do it and they call it, um.... What was that word again? "Sheering"? I think that's it.
Personally, I think it sounds rubbish.

I had honestly forgotten about the double strength bonus thing for using a double saber. I wasn't asking just to rules lawyer or anything, but I figured that there had to be a reason to give the option of different saber styles. Otherwise, why take up the space of offering an interlocking saber. So, assuming I wield an interlocking saber, I can use each saber single handed, or hook them together and use each one double handed? Nifty. ;D
That's why I asked. I'd forgotten about that.

You only get the double str bonus when you attack with only one end. If you attack with both ends then its as normal.
Thought that needed some clarification.

Actually, the wording is "Melee weapons also add the wielderÂ´s Strength bonus to damage, or twice the wielders Strength bonus when wielded in two hands". At least I interpret this as meaning you get the double bonus whenever you wield a melee weapon in two hands, even if if it is a double weapon.
Although I seem to recall reading something like what you say Alicia, I canÂ´t find any official errata or clarifications, but perhaps it is hidden away somewhere in the WotC forums. I havenÂ´t visited those in a long time.
