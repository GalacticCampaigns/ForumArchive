<span style="font-size: 2.40em;">A section by section explanation:</span>
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Heroic Characteristics</span>**
This section has all your basic information for normal play.
**Character Name** - Your character's full name
**CL** - Character/Challange level; Sum of all heroic levels and 1/3 for non-heroic levels
**Size** - Small, Medium, Large, Huge. Each size class has its own penalties and bonuses depending on size.
**Sex** - Male, female, etc.
**Race** - Each race will have their own bonuses and penalties.
**Level** - Here you mark what classes and what level in that class you are. ie Noble 3 / Soldier 1 (It is recommended to put what your first level class was first.)
**DP** - Destiny Points. You get 1 DP each time you level. With only a limited number of DP at your disposal use them wisely.
**FP** - Force Points. You get a certain amount of FPs depending on your level; 5+1/2 level for the base classes and 6+1/2 level for most prestige classes. When you level you reset the amount of FPs you have with the amount the class receives. Any unspent points are lost.
**Dark Side** - Your Dark Side Score.
**Init** - Initiative modifier.
**Senses** - Here you would mark whether you have low-light vision or darkvision, then your Perception modifier (or your UtF modifier if you have the talent Force Perception)
**Languages** - This is where all the languages you know are recorded. You know your racial languages + INT mod, though you will always have your racial languages even if you have a negative INT.
**Immune** - If you have any traits which make you immune to anything place them here. ie droid traits, fear, mind affecting.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Defensive Attributes</span>**
**Defenses** - Reflex, Fortitude and Will. You would also mark in this line any defensive capabilities such as Block, Deflect, Elusive Target, Unstoppable Force etc. Anything which would give your defenses an edge.
**HP** - Your total amount of Hit Points.
**DR** - Damage Reduction would be recorded here. Some races and abilities grant a character DR, but it's rare.
**DT** - Damage Threshold = your Fortitude + any misc modifiers like the feat Improved Damage Threshold.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Attacks and other Combat Actions</span>**
**Speed** - The base speed of your character. Defined by your race, talents and/or armor.
The next section is where you would list out your attacks with ranged and melee weapons. The template has it "by weapon" because even if you don't have a weapon in your possession for melee or ranged it's still important to know what the modifier to attack will be.
If you have rapid strike, rapid shot, or any ability which diferentiates your attacks in some way from the norm, it is recommended to list them out with the changes.
> **For example wrote:**
>
> **Melee** unarmed +5 (1d4+3)
> **Ranged** Heavy Blaster pistol +6 (3d8+2)
> **Ranged** Heavy Blaster pistol +4 (4d8+2) with rapid shot
> **Ranged** Heavy Blaster pistol +1/+1 (3d8+2) with Dual Weapon Mastery
> **Ranged** Heavy Blaster pistol -1/-1 (4d8+2) with Dual Weapon Mastery and Rapid Shot

**Base Atk** - Your base attack bonus provided by your classes.
**Grp** - Grapple. Str or Dex mod (whichever is higher) + base attack bonus + size mod
**Attack Options** - Any abilities which would effect your attacks. ie rapid strike, rapid shot, Coordinate, point blank shot, precise shot, autofire (weapon), devestating attack. I would not put Weapon Focus or Weapon Specialization here as I would have already included the bonuses with the attacks above already.
**Special Actions** - These would be actions which you could use in combat. They normal require an action to be spent and have some sort of effect. ie Bolster Ally, Force Haze, Battle Meditation, Fool's Luck, etc
**Force Powers** - Your Force Power suite along with your Use the Force modifier.
**Starship Maneuvers** - Your maneuver suite granted by the feat Starship Tactics.
**Force Regimens** - Your Regimen suite granted by the feat Force Regimens.
**Force Techniques** - You get Techniques from the Force Adept Sith Apprentice, Imperial Knight, and Jedi Knight prestige classes. You would record the ones you take here.
**Force Secrets** - Also earned from the prestige classes Jedi Master, Sith Lord, and Force Disciple.
**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Detailed Attributes</span>**
**Abilities** - Your ability scores for Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma are recorded here.
**Special Qualities** Racial benefits or other abilities of note here which wouldn't fall under the category of Special Actions or Attack Options. Ie Breathe Underwater, Serenity, Delay Damage, Pheromones.
**Talents** - All talents from your classes are listed here.
**Feats** - All feats from your classes and character levels.
**Skills** - Trained skills and any skills which have been modified abnormally. ie if you are size small you have a +5 to Stealth. You would include Stealth here even if you aren't trained in it.
**Possessions** - Anything you own. Please remember to keep encumbrance in mind.
