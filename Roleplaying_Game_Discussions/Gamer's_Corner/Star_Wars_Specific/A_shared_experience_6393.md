# A shared experience

### **simplyscribed** (2008-02-06 20:58:04)

I do a lot of tying-in between games I run and take part in. As an example, my character Red from Rowen's *After Effects*  has appeared as an NPC in my own Rebellion era tabletop campaign, and has become part of a Legacy era idea discussed by master_Tru, Anazider, and myself that may well appear in any Legacy game run by us. More on that the moment one of us uses it.
Not only does this sort of tie-in provide great continuity in setting, it reminds me that fanon material created by other roleplayers is just as rich a source of ideas as the body of accepted canon. Not only that, but using ideas from the games of others in my own forges links between our games, making them part of a larger, shared *Star Wars* experience that is quite unique.
To that end, I propose we begin collecting together all of our fanon material in one place, gathering it in a body that is easy for all Galactic Campaigns GMs to search through and exploit. <a href="http://saga.wetpaint.com/page/Indexes+%7C+Galactic+Campaigns+Fanon">I&amp;#39;ve created a unique index on R2D20 for the purpose</a>, though depending on the scope of the project we might find it easier to create a new Wiki for it.
Good idea? Bad idea? Suggestions? Have your say here.

I wanted to resurrect this thread and the idea contained herein, as it has come up in the chat. (I also recommend everyone try stopping by the chat every so often. S'where all the *real* decisions for the community are made. <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->P)

I'm happy to see this idea get some mileage, but as of now I'm not in a position to head the project. Not if it involves anything as significant as developing a wiki for it, at any rate.
R2D20 can always be recast to do the job - it's not like anyone but me is using it for anything else right now, and since sagaconversions has recently become a wiki it seems likely that R2D20 has outlived its usefulness in that area.

That would be great, it would be like 'Living Galactic Campaigns'. When we do this, make sure that the online contact info for the original creator is taken. That way when their stuff appears in your games, you can thank them and invite them to read it!
