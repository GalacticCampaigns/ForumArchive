# Pre-Generated characters

### **Avarna** (2009-02-20 19:10:28)

Alright, I've signed up to run the first three adventures of the Dawn of Defiance at a local gaming convention. I doubt any of you would be interested in coming to North Dakota for the con, so I won't plug it.
Anyway, I've decided to make pre-generated characters available for the people that haven't played Saga before. Which is where I'm going to ask for help, coming up with these characters. So basically I need six (6) characters, written up at levels 1, 3 and 5. And remember its a 28 point build.

Racial traits:
Confusion: As a defense mechanism, all Yarkora can use a combination of motion and sounds to distract and deter potential enemies. Once per encounter as a standard action, a Yarkora can make a deception check against the Will Defense of all targets within 6 squares. If the Deception check result equals or exceeds a targetsâ€™ will defense, that target does not threaten any squares until the end of the Yarkoraâ€™s next turn. This is a mind affecting ability
Deceptive: Naturally gifted at Manipulation, a Yarkora can choose to reroll any deception check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if its worse.

Force Slam:
Time: Standard Action
Target: All targets within a 6 square cone and within line of sight
Make a Use the Force Check. Make one roll and compare the result to each targetâ€™s Fortitude Defense. If the result equals or exceeds a targetâ€™s Fortitude Defense, it takes 4d6 points of Force Damage and is knocked prone.

This was an act of desperation on my part. So please ignore.
But if you like one of these character builds, by all means make use of it.
