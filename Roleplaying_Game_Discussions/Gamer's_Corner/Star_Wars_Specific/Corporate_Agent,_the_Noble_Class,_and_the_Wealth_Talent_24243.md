# Corporate Agent, the Noble Class, and the Wealth Talent

### **Anonymous** (2009-06-27 02:13:34)

Hey guys,
I was looking over the various presige classes for my character and I'm in a situation. I sent an email to the Coastal Wizards, to see if this came across before, and while I'm waiting for them I want to hear what you guys have done.
Here's what I sent (after looking throught the FAQ):
My 7th level hero took 7 levels in the Noble class and qualifies for the Corporate Agent Prestige Class. I took the Lineage talent Wealth at first level. According to the corporate Agent, I have access to the Lineage talents. Since I took the Wealth talent, does my level in Corporate Agent and Noble stack? If not, can I take the Wealth talent again, since the Corporate Agent has access to it?
Well, hope this clarifies any problems that might crop up in the future.

As I understand it, under the game rules any talents that have level based bonuses (such as Wealth) all classes that have access to that specific talent stack. So, Noble, Corporate Agent, Crime Lord, all stack. The only ones that don't are the classes that do not get access to that talent tree.
This was on Wizards' message boards somewhere as a quasi-official ruling (From one of the Devs, Rodney I believe....) some time ago as I recall. Sorry, but I don't have a link.

IÂ´ll second the above. As I recall, the issue was first came across with the Dark Healing talent, and was whether Sith Lord and Sith Apprentice levels stacked. This should be the same.

I will say that Crime Lord does not qualify. You can use the Wealth talent to get into the class, but since it does not have access to those talents itself, you do not get to stack its levels with Noble. As of the moment, only the Corporate Agent prestige class does.

To put this debate to rest once and for all:
The Wealth Talent has been Errataed. Its now Character Level x5000 instead of Class Level x 5000

It does help to read the errata, folks. O0

It is NOT character level. It's still class level but "class" has been expanded to include classes which have access to the talent tree.
