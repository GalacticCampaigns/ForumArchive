# Encounter Questions

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-16 02:22:28)

Stupid questions by a novice GM.
1) Does the method for determining the CL for an encounter strike anyone else as odd? Most of the time there's no problem, but sometimes it just seems off.
Example: Two CL 5 enemies are in a single encounter. Now, if the given method(total CL/3) is to be believed, then why does the encounter have a lower CL than the enemies?
2)Is experience given out per encounter or per enemy? I'm thinking per enemy, but I haven't been able to locate anything in the rules to prove this.

it's because it's assumed that there are 4 heroes, and so 4 heroes can usually take on 2 enemies, even with a higher CL then them, if they outnumber them (and the opponents CL are not more than 3 higher than the heroes's cl)
experience is per enemy
a better encounter designer guide exists on the wizards site though, click on downloads and is the 5th one from the top, under the link fair encounters

I realize that this is an old thread, but I thought I might put in my two cents
I use the following formula to figure out how many baddies to throw at my group:
[(Average level of heroes)+(# of heroes -4)]*3 for fair encounters
[(Average level of heroes)+(# of heroes -4)+2]*3 for serious encounters
[(Average level of heroes)+(# of heroes -4)+4]*3 for a "Holy Crap! Someone Died!" encounter
That gives me a CL "budget" that I then spend on troopers, informants, traps, hazards, etc. I've built an excel sheet that helps me keep track of the math, and even lets me plan a bit on how many of what I use as well as the credit rewards system.
Also remember, for any new GMs that are out there, this is just a guide. You should always include environments, which change the CL of the encounter. Try to remember to change out some weapons. The core rule book even suggests giving one of the troopers a flamethrower, for example. Give cover, which changes the CL. Vary the rooms. There's a ton of things to keep in mind. I just use this stuff to help out.

An interesting method.Â  I'll have to try it out.
