# Advice for Noob GMs

### **Thraken** (2009-05-27 12:05:00)

Greetings to thee. No there is no advice given here. I am here to take advice >8)
With certain materials having become available I am teetering dangerously close to attempting a campaign again (With actual somewhat original material this time!). So first I wanted to call around to see if you have any general advice for a new starter in this field.
Only one specific question I have - what's a good and manageable number of players for a given game? (one that doesn't require a good range of classes and skills)

---

### **Avarna** (2009-05-27 12:11:44)

The Most correct answer to your question, is how many you as the GM feel you can handle. But usually the "Ideal" party is 4 to 6 players.

I have more experience as a player than a GM but 3-5 seems to braket the sweet spot. 3 in a pinch, 4 is a good number, 5 pushed the boundary but is just as workable as 4. I find 6+ gets unmanagable really fast. I have the experience from GM and as player that backs this up.

Hmm, I suppose 4 or maybe 5 players is a good amount to start with, but IÂ´m sure that varies from persons. IÂ´ve tried to keep that in the few games IÂ´ve ran, and it has worked ok. 4 is also the amount assumed in the books GM sections.

I have been running games over a few years now. I have run 2 player games and up to 8 (which was crazy at times) if your not sure stick to the standard 4, 3 is ok but you will find more player interaction with 4 which will help tell the story with you.

---

### **Anazider** (2009-05-27 14:51:52)

I find 5 to be the sweet spot, really. With that number, you tend to get most of your "positions" filled in some fashion (leader, mechanic, skills, violence, face/bankroll), interaction is varied without being cluttered or repetitive, easier to balance encounters, and if you take one or two of the characters away for side-story stuff, everyone else isn't left in the lurch.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-05-27 16:03:42)

If you're going to run with lower than 4, I'd suggest NPC backup to fill out the other spots. Like has been said already, 5-6 is the usual maximum for most GMs, especially if you're new.
However, as a GM of some time now, I prefer the idea of big parties. Lots of player interaction, but I only run big parties (see The Unsung) in pbp games, since all I have to do is make sure I've read everything and then I'm usually fine.
However, and finally, I'd go with Ava's advice. What do you feel comfortable with?

---

### **Rowen** (2009-05-27 20:13:57)

Everyone has given great advice. I agree with the "use what you feel comfortable" saying. But I would suggest if your a new GM (like me), that you stick to 4 players. Like several said before me it gives you great player interaction with out over loading you, the GM. If that proves to easy, or you just want to add more players you can always recruit via your casting call again and add them at the correct time/setting in your campaign.
Hope this helps! <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Thraken** (2009-05-28 10:29:29)

Thanks for the answers all!
Aye it seems 3-5 seems to be the ballpark to go for - I do intend for there to be masses of npcs. No insular antisocial group of adventurers to be had :P
Any other general advice?

---

### **Avarna** (2009-05-28 10:51:01)

Now I don't follow this one. but some people find it helpful to have an outline of events in the game. Key things to have happen during the campaign, then also for each adventure.

Err on the side of fun.

Nice universal rule to apply to any decision, GMing or otherwise, with attention paid to investing in future fun. Agreed.

### **Thraken** (2009-05-29 17:04:05)

Fun eh? Sadly I have far too little of that - may not be able to cough any up for you :P
Does anyone happen to know of any random encounter table guidelines? If not I guess I'll queue it up for a search session.

Here is a guide to encounter design that Wizards put out several months after Saga was released. You can download the PDF on the page as well. Hope this is what you were looking for. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Useful, but not quite <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
What I'm doing isn't particularly linear so I was looking for a random way to select tasks without having to pick em myself.
Maybe I'll have a go at dissecting Scum and Villainy again.

### **Thraken** (2009-07-05 10:35:58)

Have any of you had any experience of a campaign where XP is not evenly distributed?
I'd like to have your views on how any difference in Levels in the games affect balance and gameplay if any.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2009-07-05 15:31:36)

I do not recommend letting characters level at an uneven rate to each other (not even if players miss sessions) for several reasons:
Even if a player lags behind for good reasons (ie - because you've awarded roleplaying experience and they weren't trying, or they missed a session) you have still created an unbalanced environment in which you clearly have favourites. This does nothing good for the health of a game.
Second, you only make balancing encounters harder for yourself by doing so.
Now, starting a game where characters are of different levels deliberately? That's a different story, since there's a conceptual conceit behind it. There are still lots of problems, though - balancing encounters can be a nightmare, and the lower level characters may not get to do much while the high level characters dominate the spotlight.
I've created an uneven environment in Ripples in the Deep, where there are masters and apprentices. I chose to get round potential issues by having the players create one of each so there is still a balance between players, if not between characters.

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-05 22:46:53)

I've done it before, though it's not easy.
It was back during the RCR days, when characters gained levels at a slower rate. A new player joined my group at level 1, while the other 4 were level 7. For the first few sessions it was hard to make things even--I just dropped in an extra one or two low-level baddies for her to fight and told the other players to leave them for her and to concentrate on the more difficult opponents. They didn't have a problem with that, since they tended to go after the more challenging baddies first anyway, while they had more health left.
At first, she leveled up after every session as she was gaining tons more experience than characters of her level did and she made it to 4th level when they got to 8th, and was at 8th when they got to 11th. After those first few sessions, though (about when she got to level 4) you never noticed the difference because we'd all learned how to adapt to having a lower-level character involved. The biggest difficulty came in the fact that she was a Small character and had a speed 4m less and couldn't compete with them when movement mattered--but it had nothing to do with her level. We had no problems with her character outside of that speed difference.
There was another player who left the game for awhile in the middle and ended up between the other two levels. Her character (despite advice not to) was spread so thin trying to do too much that the character couldn't compete (even with the lower-level character). Basically, it can work if the lower-level character is built right, as long as the other players are willing to give the lower-level one a chance.

### **Thraken** (2009-07-08 11:00:32)

Heh, the wondering about varying XP levels was due to thoughts about having some variety between the characters. varying between one or two levels difference for example. I imagine it's not as likely to occur at higher levels due to the greater amounts of XP required to level?
With no other words of wisdom on the last - to the next question. How were your experiences when players split up and went off doing different things? :o

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-07-09 03:34:20)

When I was running a new World of Darkness game, I read about a GM who gave out extra xp for 'secret' goals in order to encourage roleplaying and group dynamics. It worked like this: the player is given a few little goals by the GM, and was required to keep the tasks a secret (no xp if the others figure out what the goals are). The trick was the goals. One character was tasked with "help this character in combat" while another one was required to "if that character gets into a argument, back him up". I did this, and added in a few things like "find out the names (if any) of all the other character's mother" and "in one scene, display anger in a way everyone knows you are pissed".
The scary thing? It worked. The group began to gel so much better, and more roleplaying happened. Now, I didn't come up with the idea, so if anyone finds the article, let me know. I need to thank that guy/gal.

That sounds like a really awesome idea.

### **Thraken** (2009-07-09 08:07:12)

indeed :o

### **Rebaav** (2009-07-09 11:04:51)

@ BreederofPuppets
"It's like a totally different kind of cheating!" Bart Simpson quote likely mangled.
If the group has problems role playing, force it. I love it and have been in groups that that would have been amazing!

Yup, tends to happen frequently. It isnÂ´t really that hard to keep track of, but I think you should take care not to let one group advance too much ahead of the other in a PbP game. ItÂ´s easy to fill a few pages for one group while the players of the other one might have trouble getting posts up, and once they do, it can be frustrating to see the game having progressed so far ahead of you.

It can also be frustrating for the faster group when they inevitably have to be put on hold so the others can catch up with events.

Move quickly, when you do. Invariably, someone will do something to enter combat or some other in real life time consuming event. When this happens, roll for initiative, and...switch to the other guys. Move them along for a bit, and don't worry if they end up anywhere near the poor sod fighting the city guard by himself or not. Keep switching back and forth in intervals, doing your best to pace the game where the scene with the loner is dealt with and everyone can get together without an issue.
Will everyone go to sleep or the bar and a single hero go and try and break into FBI headquarters? You betcha. Try to send everyone else out for pizza about that time. Otherwise...just deal with it. Annoying, but hey, nothing goes as exactly as planned, right?

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-07-15 05:59:42)

Oh, more short one line advise:
Don't fall in love with yer NPC's. Those are the ones the characters kill first.
Have the bad guy get away a few times before finally being defeated. The desire to finally defeat "that guy" is a powerful one.
Foreshadow from time to time. I did this once, having the players hear of a big nasty troll and his band of troll warriors. The decided to rest and recover spells before approching the beast's camp, for all they hype they have heard. When the three headed troll with a frost breath, pair heavy axes, and a few levels of barbarian landed in the middle of their camp, swinging those blades like the thresher in the field...much, much screaming, running, and whispered cuss words.
Never say "no". Say either "sure, roll it" or "that's a high difficultly, are you sure?". Even if whatever they do should have no game effect, let them go for it. Apply a game effect if they succeed. It doesn't have to be ig, just enough to be interesting. Playing in another game, where another player made a guy whose character idea was to tie up the leader of a gang and smash him, then intimidate the others (maybe pick up some followers that way). First game, the character was charge by a group of orcs, and the player asked to do a spot check to see which one was the leader. The GM looks at the game stats, and says "they all look about the same". Me, I would have pointed out one that looked bigger than the others, and said "he looks a bit more meaner than the others, and scars are more impressive" and maybe assigned that orc a +1 to hit. When that orc got killed, the other orcs would suffer a -1 to hit, having just seen their leader fall. For a few rounds, anyhow. Ya know, just enough to show the player's out-of-the-five-foot-step-and-full-attack-box thinking has an effect. He'll be happy, and he'll look for more ways to do cool stuff.
