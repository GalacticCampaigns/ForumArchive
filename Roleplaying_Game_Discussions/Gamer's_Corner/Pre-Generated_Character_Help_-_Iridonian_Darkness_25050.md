# Pre-Generated Character Help - Iridonian Darkness

### **Alicia** (2011-06-27 05:49:39)

Hey all! Pull out your dusty character ideas! I'm looking for some help in creating a mass selection of pre-generated characters for a convention I'll be attending 2nd weekend of July.
I'll be using the Iridonian Darkness module released by WOTC for this one.
Iridonian Darkness takes place a few months after Darth Revan and Darth Malak return from the Unknown Regions at the head of a Sith invasion fleet. After reeling from the initial attacks, the Republic is now mobilizing to halt the invasion’s rapid progress. The Jedi have already committed to aiding the Republic and repelling the Sith.
Republic forces are wary, due to high-level defections of Republic forces to the invaders. The defectors, military and Jedi alike, are often former followers of Revan from the Mandalorian Wars. It is a time where even personal friendship is no guarantee of loyalty.
The start of Iridonian Darkness assumes that the heroes work for the Jedi Order, a Jedi-related organization, mercenaries, security forces, or the Republic military. They are hired by or assigned to Iridonian forces to help combat local Mandalorian splinter groups who have become mercenaries and raiders since the end of the Mandalorian Wars. The adventure also assumes that the heroes have at least a passing acquaintance with Duqua Dar, a local Zabrak Jedi Knight. Ideally, the heroes should have no objections to engaging Mandalorian units, fallen Jedi, or Sith agents, but exceptions do arise.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">**Character Creation**</span>

* 32 point buy for stats (does not include racial or ability changes)
* Level 5
* Max HP for level
* For 3/4 BAB classes (noble, scout, scoundrel), use total level in classes instead of starting over
* **credits**  40,000 credits; Double total if taking wealth. (please limit excessive amount equipment, including upgrades, Weight capacity will be observed)
* **Books to use** any
* **Races** Era specific. Make sure to look in the Wookiepedia to see if they were actually around during this time.
* Please include a background for the character. It doesn't have to be long, just enough to give the player an idea on where the character comes from, motives, etc.

I ask when writing out the stat block you make a separate list of where the non-core references are coming from. This includes equipment. I ask for this so I can located the information more easily as I'll be typing up non core abilities (and maybe even some CORE) to make it easier for the players to know what they can do without having to search through books during the session.
Descriptions and/or picture would be helpful.

I´ve got a couple of ideas that I´ll start working on when I get home from practice in a few hours.
**One Question**: For what kind of players would you like the characters written? Just to give an idea of how complex tactics and builds to use.

I'll have an array of players who will be experienced and those I may have to do some hand holding. I've never been to this con and I know at least one of my usual convention players will be there with his wife (both of which have of course played). I figure even if the character's tactics are complex with the abilities listed they will have an idea what the toon can do. I'm assuming most of my players will be male.

Hey folks! Got just about a week left before I have to run this. Anyone have characters they can toss my way?

I don't have time to write out some complete stats for you but for a support type you could always modify Callia's sheet copied below. At 5th level this character build is not only the ultimate skill-monkey but also has started branching into Jedi, making him somewhat useful as a backup to the party's main Force-sensitive.
I can't remember off-hand exactly how many points were spent before applying 4th level bonuses so abilities may need tweaking.
I'd just suggest replacing the following feats and talents: Biotech Specialist, Biotech Surgery, Cybernetic Surgery, and Wealth with something more practical for a con game (possibly more skill focuses?). Everything else should be a good fit. Would be worth spending a fair portion of the available credits on one or two droids so the player has more to do in a fight than just hide and use battle meditation.

had forgotten I had this guy, he's kind of a Star Wars Sword and Board build. If ya have any DnD players not terribly comfortable they could run this and be right at home. There's two builds of him too. I seem to remember everyone in the game hating this guy, but maybe face to face they won't lol. These were built under Simply's oddball system for Saga multiclass, which I don't remember the rules to.

Riot Shield
Riot shields are common gear for law enforcement and planetary defense forces. Measuring about 1 meter long and half as wide, a riot shield is made of a metal frame that generates an energy shield that bends light so that its outer surface is opaque while its inner side is transparent, allowing you unobstructed vision but not extending the same benefit to your opponents. A riot shield has DR 5, 20 hitpoints, and a break DC of 25.
When held, a riot shield grants you cover (+5 cover bonus to your Reflex Defense) against all ranged attacks on any turn during which you fight defensively. You can also wield a riot shield as a melee weapon. When used in this way, it has the same statistics as a stun baton (small simple weapon, 2d6 stun damage)
Cost 500; Weight 6 kg; Availability Military.
