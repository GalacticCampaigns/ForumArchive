The lightsaber is wider than most, with the activation switch nowhere to be seen. The hand grip consists of a protruding spiral piece that is offset by beveled glyphs following along the spiral to the bottom. The grip looks worn and some of the glyphs have been darkened from use making some more pronounced.

Having spent the first few years of her life in an orphanage, her parentage is unknown as she had lost her memory of any time before being brought to the orphanage. Like most Jedi, Marina was discovered to be talented in the Force at a young age and was sent to the temple to study. Discovered on an Outer Rim world by a healer who had been sent to deal with a plague, at the age of ten she was taken as a Padawan by a Twi'lek master called Firith Ven. Though Ven had been adament against taking on another student, he finally relinquished his stance at the urging of Master Yoda. It was through the influences of Ven's people that Marina took the surname of Numa, which means "sister" in Ryl. She believed she had found the family she may never have had if she had never been sent to the Temple.
The best days of her life were spent in practice sessions with Master Ven. These sessions were spent brawling using only her fists against her master and debating tactics with him. Her skills were put to good use when the Clone Wars started, but those good days with Master Ven were coming quickly came to an end.
Sent to aid in the Battle of Geonosis, Master Ven and Marina were ambushed while in pursuit of the retreating Separatist leaders and they barely managed to escape. Unbeknownst to Marina, Ven had taken a mortal wound and died believing his apprentice was on her way back to the safety of Coruscant and the Jedi Temple. Shocked by her master's unexpected death, she eventually takes his lightsaber as her own as a memento of her only father figure.
With the start of the war, the availability of a suitable master to finish her training became hard to come by and as a result she spent time under the tutelage of several masters. The longest and last of these was Silas Draay. Taken on as his student during the last months of the Clone Wars it was a change of pace from the training she had received from Firith Ven. A diplomat by nature, Silas was regularly sent on secret missions to locate and speak with other Force using cultures. The Jedi were concerned that other traditions might be drawn into the war against them and sought a peaceful means to ensure that didn't happen.
It was during one such mission that Order 66 was initiated and the two only escaped the initial purge because no clones were sent with them. Sensing their brethren's death, Silas urged Marina to stay on the planet for a time while he left to investigate what was happening. Unhappily, she followed his orders and stayed on the planet, but soon realized that her master was not coming back.
