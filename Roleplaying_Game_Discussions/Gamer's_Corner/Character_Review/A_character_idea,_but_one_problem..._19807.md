# A character idea, but one problem...

### **Akisa** (2008-10-21 04:12:53)

I have a character idea but no game (that's not the problem I have) so I kind of left it open and I'll go into more detail once I know the setting.
Liku was born on Darsey a backwater in the outer rim to a small but well off family. Perhaps because of her families status and lived in the largest city on the planet she never had to learn the talents of a scout, or scoundrel. However Liku was never interested in the subtleness of diplomacy nor had the ability to inspire people. In school Liku participated in Gymnastics and fencing which thought her how to become agile and the basic of melee combat.
However little did Liku know she was force sensitive, and had strong potential in using the force. Despite no formal training Liku on how to use the force Likuâ€™s innate powerâ€™s greatly outmatches many of those who obtain such training. Some say Liku even has the potential to even surpass the greatest force users, even ____ (insert most powerful force user at the time, and I'll be increasing CHA so by UTF check I'll beat the Emperor or Revan at lvl 20) himself. As for how I get a lightsaber I'm on what's the setting...
Using 28 Point buy I created this set of [stats](http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheets/view.php?id=84639 "http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheets/view.php?id=84639").
I took skill focus UTF and trained in UTF to justified being extremely powerful in the force at an early age. But now the problem is she is trained in UTF and the same time she's not. So how do I justified not being trained but at the same time being trained? And if I remove being trained in UTF I no longer qualified for Skill focus UTF and thus she's not strong with the force (mere +2). The only way around this is forget the word being trained and not use trained portion of the skills, an exception maybe stuff that maybe instinctual like reaching out for a weapon that's just out of reach, and suddenly it floats into her hand. My problem with this is with my belief that the character should match the c-sheet (no charismatic or smart people with an 8 in the relevant stat).

I donÂ´t see a problem with what youÂ´re saying, to use the Force in instinctual ways, often unconscious. I have a character who is like that now, he is trained in Use the Force, but the only thing he has except for that is the Force Pilot talent. I just describes this (and since he doesnÂ´t know he is Force Sensitive, this is how he explains it to himself) as him having a knack for piloting (Force Pilot), a sixth sense for danger (Search your Feelings, Sense Surroundings), and very strong instincts (Search your Feelings, Sense Surroundings).

I had a force sensitive in a game I ran who didn't know he was force sensitive.  I forget the exact rules/force powers he had, but we called them something like this:
He had "Roguish Smile" (bonus to social skills), "Gambler's Luck" (bonus to skills") and "Knowing when to Run" (Danger Sense)

I like this idea. And if I didn't have enuff players I would let you in. I often wanted to make a character that was this way. He was going to just basically denie that fact that he was. I still might. I was thinking more of a scoundrel character.
