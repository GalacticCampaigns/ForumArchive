# Help me with my jedi build now that KOTOR is out

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-29 20:17:05)

I had my jedi I am using for Dawn of Defiance mapped all the way through lvl 20 with all his feats, talents, etc. mapped out. He is listed below:
1. Jedi 1 - Deflect, *Force Training,* *Skill Focus: Use the Force*, Force Sensitivity*, Weapon Proficiency (Lightsabers)*, Weapon Proficiency (Simple Weapons)*
2. Jedi 2 - *Power Attack*
3. Jedi 3 - Block, *Acrobatic Strike*
4. Jedi 4 - *Powerful Charge*,
5. Scoundrel 1 - *Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)*, Foolâ€™s Luck
6. Jedi 5 â€“ Force Intuition, *Force Training*
7. Jedi 6 - *Weapon Focus (Lightsabers)*
8. Jedi 7 - *Bantha Rush*, , [Build Lightsaber], Weapon Specialization: Lightsabers
9. Jedi Knight 1 - , *Force Training*, Soresu
10. Jedi Knight 2 â€“ Force Point Recovery
11. Jedi Knight 3 â€“ Redirect Shot
12. Jedi Knight 4 - *Triple Crit: Lightsabers*, Force Point Recovery,
13. Jedi Knight 5 - Juyo
14. Jedi Knight 6 â€“ Improved Sense Surroundings
15. Jedi Master 1 - , Fearless, Serenity, Equilibrium, *Force Training*
16. Jedi Master 2 - **Quicken Power** (Backhanded method of getting more force attacks, etc. in a round),
17. Jedi Master 3 - **Multitarget Power**, Force Fortification
18. Jedi Knight 7 â€“ Vaapad, *Force Training*
19. Jedi Knight 8 â€“ Force Point Recovery
20. Jedi Knight 9 - Shii-Cho,
I took a lot of colloboration on these boards to build him to be a machine in combat with a good mix of saber and force abilities. However, now that the KOTOR book is out, which is my fave setting for Star Wars, I see some fantastic talents I may want to add to my build.
I was very tempted by the new jedi sentinal talents on pg 25. Sentinel Strike, Sentinel's Gambit, Dark Retaliation and prestige talents Improved Sentinel Strike, , Improved Sentinel's Gambit, Dark deception, Taint of the Dark Side. Some of these to be really good might need to be taken multiple times (ex: Sentinel Strike).
I am asking you fantastic jedi masters out there to look at my build in terms of overall combat effectiveness and decided which, if any, of these KOTOR talents you would add to my overall build to make me even more badass. Please feel free to take my build and alter it any way you like to show me what kind of a build you would make with these new KOTOR talents and core book talents as well.
Thanks in advance!

15. Jedi Master 1 - , Fearless, Serenity, Improved Sentinelâ€™s Gambit (KOTOR), *Force Training*
16. Jedi Master 2 - **Quicken Power** (Backhanded method of getting more force attacks, etc. in a round),
17. Jedi Master 3 - **Multitarget Power**, Force Fortification
18. Jedi Knight 7 â€“ Vaapad (Critical Hit on a 19 or 20 w/ saber), *Force Training*
19. Jedi Knight 8 â€“ Force Point Recovery technique
20. Jedi Knight 9 â€“Sentinel Strike (KOTOR),
Please feel free to critique this like mad and give me any changes or suggestions or comments you feel would help. The only concern I have with this build is that I gave up a lot of talents to take Sentinel's Gambit, Improved Sentinel's Gambit, and 2 Sentinel Strikes for this Dawn of Defiance character. But this combo is only effective vs. characters with a Dark Side score above 1 and since this is Dawn of Defiance do you think it will be a relatively common occurrence to face opponents like that? One talent I had to drop that I will surely miss is Equilibrium.
