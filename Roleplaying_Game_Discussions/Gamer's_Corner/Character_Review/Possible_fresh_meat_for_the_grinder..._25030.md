My intent is to go first, and start moving my enemy combatant down the condition track as soon as possible. Does this build do that well for 1st level? Is there something else I should be looking at?

* EDIT 2:Updated credits & Ref Def/FF

only thing jumping out at me right off the bat is the credits. you get max, so 3d4x250 = 3000, + 2000 for wagered item = 5000. as for your strategy, idk, its not one i've seen much of. can always try it and see. there are other weapons that would make it easier by far though.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-09 16:25:47)

You should have a flat-footed RD of 12 and a Damage Threshold of 15, otherwise I don´t see anything.

Hmm...

The reason I am thinking this, is to start pulling of their aim and defenses immediately.
Also, I did look through the many books, and without taking weapon proficiency: heavy weapons....which I plan to take with this character at some point...assuming survival that is...there are not many options that I saw.
Grenade launchers and missile launchers come to mind, but care to give me an example so I can get a better feel for what you are thinking here?
I am not 100% in love with this weapon configuration, and welcome any constructive criticism.
Thank you so much for you time.

I had thoughts on doing something similar but in melee, which is easier at low level. Now that I go back and look I'm seeing that you're right, most of the weapons I was thinking of are heavy or exotic (Tensor rifle is nice though). One other option is Disruptors and DA's current rifle, the Bryar. The Bryar allows you to bump damage by a die, Disruptors ignore 5 points of DT. Disruptors are expensive though. There's the Bluebolt and the Stun Pistol with their greater stun range also.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-05-11 08:10:47)

If you are going to go with Stun weapons, I would recommend that you get a damage upgrade to them. Even with Devastating Attack, you are only likely to break DT 15 with an average attack (assuming 3d6 Stun Pistol, which I think is your best weapon choice for Stun weapons), and that isn´t going to increase at any rapid rate, while the DT of the opposition will increase faster. It´s not a guaranteed CT hit (even though you might have above 50% chance against many opponents), and when you don´t move them down the CT, the damage they take will be very small.
I can only refer you to my last match in the arena as an example, a droid vs 2 Jawas with ion weapons. Sure, I have Imp Damage Threshold, but they have bonus damage with ion weapons, so they can almost be said to counter each other out. The point is, I took a very small amount of damage, especially if you compare to previous matches.

---

### **Berwick** (2011-05-11 23:59:55)

That match was what made me think of the CT strategy.
If the jawas had rolled better, you would have started to accumulate penalties faster and faster. Eventually ending the fight "unconscious" and at their mercy.
Hmm...good point raised there....is it worth a DSP to drive an opponent into unconsciousness and then take them out while they are helpless?

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-12 00:26:24)

I don't handle DS points the RaW way. I do have a team of Sith running around and a homicidal war-droid. Darkside points are more of a guide-post to roleplaying. How would your character handle being that bloodthirsty? And killing isn't necessarily required in every match. Sometimes it happens and doesn't matter one way or the other, sometimes (in higher Tiers) matches have strict no-kill rules, sometimes its put up or shut up, two men enter one man leave. Death does have a direct correlation to Fame, but Fame and reputation are two different things. One's a mechanic and the other is a RP tool.
I won't take direct control of a PC, I'll just lock the thread and remove it. Wanton destruction isn't welcome, and if it takes place there will be in-game warnings followed by PM followed by action. If it makes sense (for the most part) I'll allow it. Evil doesn't mean bat-shit, contrary to popular belief. Evil (or crazy) either get dealt with or they learn to control themselves, no one is powerful enough to just continue acting in a totally unacceptable way. That's RL, so that's how I handle it in game.
Any questions?

### **Berwick** (2011-05-12 18:39:53)

No. That seems pretty self-explanatory. I just didn't want to pursue a combative technique, and then rack up DSP's like they were going out of style.
This guy really doesn't seem like a natural or veteran combatant to me...he will kill if necessary, but it will always bother him.

---

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-13 00:44:24)

then RP it to the hilt <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> a normal guy who mistakenly thinks he has to kill, then does, repeatedly, and has to look at himself in the mirror every morning? finds himself doing it more easily and then has the shattering of faith (or mind) when he realizes he likes it? how he ultimately handles that realization? dude, epic potential there. lots, and i mean lots of potential heh!

---

### **Berwick** (2011-05-13 18:17:24)

Why is it that I hear an evil maniacal laugh when I read you last post? HA.
Well, honestly, I think I am done. the extra credits will be saved I think...I am interested in this bluebolt...but I always like to have things for a character to aspire too.
Ready when you are, I think.
EDIT: spelling...ugh

### **Magical2099** (2011-05-14 08:38:27)

fix your sheet (creds and FF Ref Defense) and post it to the Tale of the Tape then.

True, but the point I wanted to make was that they *didn´t*. I just wanted to point out it´s kind of a risky move unless you make sure to have a solid damage output, as the HP damage done is usually very low.

### **Berwick** (2011-05-15 17:52:57)

That is a good point. The whole CT maneuver comes down to doing as much damage as possible to trigger going over the DT.
I will have to look more into maximizing my damage output.
Thank you DA. I appreciate your input.
