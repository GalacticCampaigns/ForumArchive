# Please help with Character build for Flames of War

### **Anonymous** (2008-05-15 18:32:10)

Salutations!
I am looking at playing in DarthAnthrax's upcoming Old Republic Era Pbp titled Flames of War.
I am submitting my character concept to the board, in order to ask for your help. I have been a long time SW player, but this would actually be my first SAGA character. I would appreciate help in double checking this for mathematical errors, as well as getting your opinions on how the build represents the concept.
First off here are the particular requirements for the game:
[hide]**Characters:**Any race and class goes (as long as the race in question is plausible to be in the specified timeline). They will be Jedi, but thereÂ´s no restriction to taking the Jedi class. Everybody will be given The Force Sensitive feat and a lightsaber at 1st level.
**Attributes:**25 point buy.
**Level:** 1
**Note:** Jedi will receive a free Skill Training(Any Force skill that they qualify for) as a starting feat. I feel this will be the most balanced solution.
Also, DarthAnthrax's new force system located here: [http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=218&amp;start=23](http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=218&amp;start=23 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/swgc/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=218&amp;start=23")
EDIT: As of now, DarthAnthrax is allowing other classes to trade in non-simple weapons proficiencies to lightsabers. Change noted, and ready to change back if DarthAnthrax should change their mind.[/hide]
Now here is the concept:
[hide]A Mon Cal Jedi who was born less than 2 decades before the start of the Mandalorian Wars. He was found to be force sensitive quite early, and taken to Coruscant (is that where the Jedi where HQ'd back then around 3996 BBY?). His strength in the force was low, but elevated over the average person. He went through the majority of the training without problems, being an exceptionally bright student, but lackluster in his abilities with the force. Ultimately, he was not chosen to be a padawan, and the Reconcilliation council assigned him to the Medical Corps. It was only through close contact with the fragility of life did his force connection blossom and he was finally accepted as a padawan. He chose to continue his work with the Medical Corps as he felt that was the best place for him as he worked with the Master that was assigned to the Corps. He also started to grasp different facets of the force at an astounding pace.
I would like to push into the Jedi Healer role, and I found a good approximation of a long time build here:

He wants to investigate what is going on in the wars out there, and help the inevitable wounded that such matters bring about.[/hide]

Well, one thing I can think of right away, is hat you donÂ´t have the Force Sensitivity feat, and thus cannot make checks (or train in) any Force skills, and then also not take Force Training, wich has that feat as a prerequistite.
I edited the rules for the new system with a note to make that clearer.

Ah,
I shall rethink a little then, and post a revision.
Thank you.

Correct me if I am wrong, Anthrax, but I thought you were giving players in your game the Force Sensitive feat for free.
If not, I need to re-work my character O_o

Edit to update changes as per DarthAnthrax.
Anyone see anything else that I missed?

Yeah, all characters get FS for free. I just forgot that when I commented :P . However, I was thrown off since it wasnÂ´t listed.
I donÂ´t see anything right now Berwick, except for the fact that you donÂ´t have any starting equipment.
