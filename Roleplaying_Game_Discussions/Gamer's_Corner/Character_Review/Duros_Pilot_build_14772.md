Description/Personality:
Kasga is a bit of a wanderer. He seeks new places and new experiences. When not driven by curiousity, Kasga is a bit methodical.
Background:
Kasga Hrato was born on the Duros Mining freighter Juunpar III. The freighter was owned by the Travoti clan.
His father and mother worked on the freighter as mechanics techs for the Travoti clan. Kasga grew up aboard and picked up a lot of his mechnical knowledge from his father.
Kasga recognized early on that he wanted a broader life than his family had seen. He joined the Juunpar III militia as early as possible.
When he was age-eligable, he joined the Travoti clan pilot corps to the delight of his family. After fulfilling his obligation to the Travoti clan, Kasga started working odd hauling jobs for non-Duros companys.
This took him further from his family and Duros itself. Today, Kasga still looks for pilot work, but if an opportunity for adventure appears, he's likely to jump for it.

what kind of point buy are you using? probably low, but I think you should lower cha to 10, and raise dex or int. and what are you taking devastating attack in? vehicle weapons, or pistols? and it's 2d6 stun
and grab should be grapple, you never list grab. grp for you is +3

Thanks for your corrections. My players did not like th 25 point buy since it guaranteed an odd number attribute. So we used 26 points. I figure I can adjust if I find a game to join.
My character cannot grapple. Grapple requires the Pin or Trip feats. I have neither. So I listed grab. I'd be curious where you got the +3. I see +1 due to BAC, +1 due to Str. Also, I thought there was a penalty for Grapple and Grab.

The +3 to grapple comes from +1 (BaB) and +2 (Dex). You uses the higher of Dex and Str for your Grapple checks.
The reason grapple is listed instead of grab is probably that both Grab and Grapple attacks are unarmed attacks, but the grapple check is calculated in a different manner.
You pistols stun damage is till wrong. The errata says that weapons deals the same damage (3d6 in this case) in either mode.
You should also have only 31 Hp, and another known language.
You should also note that your Devastating Attack talent works only with *Pilot Controlled weapons on a a veichle you pilot.* You cannot take the talent for the entire Heavy weapon group, since you are not in fact proficient in that group.

Must have updated DA i'm not even seeing Devastating Attack under talents lol

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 19:33:59)

yes, he has, as he's now a soldier
but you can't have cover fire, you need battle analysis to take that. I would suggust devastating attack or weapon specialization in heavy weapons

Or Armored Defense would help him

he's lvl 1. He doesn't need it yet, and he can later switch to a flight suit anyways

*Foot in mouth*

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 19:51:00)

yes, but he wouldn't need to take it at lvl 1, he could take it at lvl 3 for padded flight suit, and lvl 5 for armored flight suit

Right you are. I guess I need to update my talent cheat sheet. I didn't know that was a prerequisite.
I haven't been too enthused by the armor talents and as a pilot Penetrating attack has much more uses.
Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I'll take more suggestions if you've got them.
