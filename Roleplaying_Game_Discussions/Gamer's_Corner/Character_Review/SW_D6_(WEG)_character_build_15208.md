> **Background &amp; biology**
> [hide]Hermaphrodites. Group cooperative mind when in the Roche asteroid field. Perhaps they venture out to develop their individuality and skill set so as to add to the Cooperative when they go home? Working for the greater cause etc. The Verpine nervous system has an unusually powerful electromagnetic aura and by controling their biological frequency modulation can pick up and communicate via radio waves.
> A business merger had the work visas of a small hive (several hundred) tech group sold to a front company specializing in stocking Imperial slave camps. Escapees were left scattered and destitute with what gear they had on them. The vast majority of the hive was spread throughout various gallactic Imperial camps and projects, seperated from their version of family (closer than most other species can appreciate). Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki, when barely a hatchling, ended up a street kid panhandling using his skills as payment. Relying on luck and the charity of others Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki was miserable and lost.
> An impression was made on passerby when he fixed an anoying and persistant clicking in their groundspeeders left side thrust assembly that had plagued the owner for some time. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki had just aquired regular employment and shortly after that a place to stay. It was soon demonstrated that Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki had an affinity for weapons systems and was soon after attached to a tech team servicing a collection of tramp freighters outfitting them with anti-piracy equipment and providing other general maintenance. The owner of the groundcar was the aparant owner of a small but lucrative transport company. The natural Verpine affinity for field technology (not that Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki knew it was inate for his species) worked out well for Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki and had a breif stint as a sheild operator on a transport run.
> One day Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki was literally stumbled upon by a recruiter for the Rebellion while working on a weapons blister. The skill and originality &amp; focus demonstrated just what the recruiter was looking for. When the offer was made Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki was near crazed with the opportunity to strike back and possibly even rejoin with his lost hive members. If not for the lack of tear ducts, well&#8230; Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki was tasked with assisting with maintaining the weapons and targetting systems of a squadron of the then new B-Wings that was dispatched in a frontier sector for shakedown.
> Though his previous hosts were gracious &amp; kind, for the first time Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki felt something akin to the family he lost. Friendships were made and Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki hazarded hope for the first time. Some of the squadron members that Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki was closest to were promoted to command &amp; man an active squadron but regular contact was maintained (as far as regular can be when part of rebellion resistance cell). One day contact was lost. It was soon after revealed that the entire squadron was wiped out due to a spectacualr intelligence failure. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki once again felt the spiral of loss and dispair and lost his sense of purpose. Still very young and with no other Verpine in his particular corner of the Galaxy Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki began to wander. Keeping to himself those that Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki began to be close to never knew the inner pain or even how to help him. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki held on for a time but eventually left his cell.
> Drifting from one job after another after that Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki eventually found himself paying for passage on a freighter called the Starfire Prince. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki thought new experiences away from the Rebel Aliance would sit better, less of a sense of loss perhaps. After several arguments were overheard between the Captain and the aparant hired hand Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki decided to investigate. As the Starfire Prince was being prepped to depart that the engines felt like they were shaking loose of their housing. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki decided it was best to leave them to their discussion. The hired hands insistance that it was a grav plating issue caused Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki great concern since they seemed to be working quite well.
> Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki found a fusion imbalance in the primaries &amp; reset the fusion initiators. The then almost thunderous shudders imediately stopped. Then the microscopic fractures in the Hyperdrive casing were noticed. With great alarm and alacrity Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki mended them and completed a basic diagnostic routine. When Captain Mahmed and his crewman came to investigate Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki had already returned (&amp; organized) the crewmans tools. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki explained what was found &amp; what was done and without even noting the astonished blink from them Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki returned to the designated cot &amp; layed down.
> Shortly after that Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki overheard a short conversation between the Captain and the mechanic. Aparantly the mechanic was worried about his wife and children and realized now that it was badly affecting his work and decided he needed to take leave. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki understood that kind of pain all too well &amp; was very pleased to see the understanding displayed by the Captain. The departure of the mechanic left an opening the Captain needed to address before he left in the crew.
> Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki felt an opportunity had just presented itself and approached Captain Mahmed. After sharing some history with him he asked Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki what was needed. Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki thought for a time then said &quot;To be provided with what I need to be useful&quot;. Captain Mahmed paused, pondering the sense of loss of a sense of home and belonging then made a decision. With a broad grin and an extended hand said &quot;Welcome home!&quot;. Imediately realizing his error (he intended to say &quot;Welcome aboard.&quot; ) he tried to correct himeself but Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki moved faster. Clasping his had with almost shacking hand Xr&#39;Tys&#39;ki said &quot;Thank you.&quot; and imediately set to a preflight check and to get familiarized with his new home.[/hide]

> **Appearance &amp; Demeanor**[hide]A thin bipedal insectoid standing 2 meters tall (two arms and two legs.) with a head dominated by large, black, compound eyes. Behind each eye is an antennae that twitches when excited and flex and move as means of expression. A hardened carapace, composed of a green chitinous substance called carahide, is as flexible as the skin of other creatures, yet tough enough to deflect a blade or even absorb a glancing blaster bolt, though is ususally covered with worker overalls. Every motion or action has gives the impression of nervous energy and the of an anorexic moving on adrenaline. This is in contrast to the calm tone that is typically used to speak punctuated by clicks and buzzes.[/hide]

So the idea is that in old school SW no hero worth his weight in bantha fodder (whatever that is) has to put up with stock gear. With the parts and time to do it Xr'Tys'ki will ensure that it won't be a concern <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
This is a D6 build so it's vastly different than Saga <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D --> for the Starfire Prince PbP New Republic Era. It's built with 10 starting skill dice vs the RAW of 7 but the RAW starting character limit of +2D on the skill does apply. I've tried to cover the basics with the Skills, Attributes and with the Background but it's been SO long since I've done D6 I'm not sure what I'm missing on this begining character build.
I'm still expanding the character concept so other ideas are very much welcome. The approach I'm taking is if it's not in the Background it's not in the build. The already mentioned Verpines having an affinity with field tech worked well for being skilled in Starship Shields which also gives him a potential position on ship (shield operator).

Though I'm wondering now if it's appropriate for the tech to be the shield operator. If the ship is taking damage, perhaps even the shield generator or projector sub systems, the place of the tech is in repairing them. As basically the ships engineer the job is maintaining and repairing systems not operating them... hmm
*Calls out to the crew* Hey guys, what do you think? The only reason it's there is to provide a position but there's only the Pilot and Support on a YT-2k so what's a better move?
Where did that field medic kit come from anyway. Everyone has a one shot medkit, it seems, in D6SW but that's really intended for a dedicated medic. Perhaps I should swap out the Sheild operator for First Aid?

A more complete version of this is now posted in the Tales of the Starfire Prince -> The Crew of the Starfire Prince.

just a note, no one that's not already in your game can view topics in that forum.

Buh!? Really? Wow, that seems to be a mistake.

I think it has something to do with having to have permission to access those topics, I think it goes away after awhile.

I've been advised it's being looked into.
Thanks for mentioning it.
