# Dark Lord of the Sith

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-08-15 17:47:45)

Some of you might remember that I asked for a GM that might be willing to run a Dark Side game, preferably set during the Old Republic, some time ago. Well, hopefully someone will take that bait, and in the meantime, I figure I could put up an example of what my character would look like (since no one else has used this forum so far) at level 7. The history presented is approximate, and certain details can of course be changed to fit into different periods of the era, but this is meant to be somewhere during the timeframe of the upcoming *Star Wars:The Old Republic*.
I was inspired by the Sith Lord shown in the magnificent trailer for the game, and have tried to balance him quite decently, although he is still mainly a fighter. Please offer comments, insights or suggestions on how to advance or something to change in the build. I have a pretty clear plan for how to proceed, but input is always welcome.

**Background** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The child that was going to become the deadly killer known as Darth Anthrax was born in orbit around the gas giant Yavin, but his parents have little consequence on this story. Matter of fact is, the child was most unwanted, and you can wonder why he wasn´t aborted even before his birth. Anyway, as the parents did not want the child, they orphaned him on the fourth moon of Yavin, and that was the last time the infant ever saw his parents. As it would happen, the place where they left the boy was very close to one of the many temple ruins present on the moon, temples erected long ago by the Massassi people. It was inside this very temple that the last ruler of Yavin 4, the Dark Lord of the Sith, Exar Kun had trapped his spirit before his defeat at the hands of the Jedi.
For reasons known only to the spirit itself, the apperance of the young infant awoke the spirit of Kun, and perhaps the Force itself told him that the boy carried a great destiny. Whatever the reasons were, Kun commanded the beasts of Yavin 4 to keep the boy safe, fed, and alive, and for the first years of his life, the boy didn´t know of any other living thing but these beasts. As he grew older, and learned to walk, he began to move about the jungles, always protected by its strongest predators, and soon he came upon the Temple of Exar Kun.
As he entered the temple, the boy started to explore the ruin, fearless of what might be inside. This was probably given due to the natural curiosity of small children, but also due to the fact that he had been ”raised” by the dark beasts of the moon, and had learned not to fear even before he could walk. As he entered the central chamber of the temple however, he felt something was wrong. And right out of thin air, the spirit of Exar Kun appeared, and for the first time in several years, he felt fear. But the fear subsided quickly, and he would curiously ask the spirit´s name. And so began his lifelong apprenticehood to Exar Kun.
For many, many years, he would train under the spirit´s tutelage, and he would be drilled in the ways of the Dark Side, and those of the Sith. As he grew older and stronger, he would be instructed in the art of lightsaber combat, learning to fight with both a single blade, and the dual blade that Kun himself had invented. Kun would also teach him about history, and how the Jedi had destroyed his body so many years ago. How he had been betrayed by a Jedi, and how the Jedi had destroyed the creations he had erected on Yavin 4, and forced him into this ghostly existence. This bred hatred for the Jedi in the boy, and Kun trained him to use that hatred, to turn it into a weapon. For years he trained, waiting for the opportunity to strike back at the heart of the Jedi. And finally, the time came.
As the Sith once again launched their war on the Republic, a team of archeologists were sent to Yavin 4, in search of ancient artifacts left remaining there from the Massassi or their Sith masters. Instead, they found him. Clad in a suit of ancient dark armor crafted by the Massassi for Kun himself, he met them as they approached the temple. Through the awareness of the Force, he had been alerted to the events in the Galaxy, and he figured his time to act had come, and commanded them to bring him to the Sith command. As the Sith apprentice sent to escort the archeologists drew his lightsaber against him, he lauched both his hands forward, sending a searing bolt of Sith lightning into the man, driving him back into a tree with enough force to leave a heavy mark in the trunk. Before the surprised Sith could even react, he had closed the distance between them and decapitated him. Intimidated and fearing for their lives, the archeologists complied and took him back to the Sith command.
As his story was a bit doubted, he was forced to prove himself in combat against three other acolytes. As he battled them, the spirit of Exar Kun manifested itself, and with the power of the spirit at his side, he easily dispatched the other. As the Sith Lords no longer doubted that he had been sent by Exar Kun to assisit them in fighting the Jedi and the Republic, he was accepted into the ranks and given the title of Sith Stalker. He would serve as a commando soldier, breaching the enemy lines before the army assault began, to take out vital targets, or enemy fortifications.

**Exar Kun´s Armor** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The armor has been crafted by the finest of Massassi and Mandalorian armorsmiths in the honor of Exar Kun, and the design is very similar to the armor worn by the Mandalorian crusaders, althought with a leaner, less ”spiky” design, and pitch-black, made from obsidian and mandalorian iron. The armor is extremely durable, unaffected by nearly any naturally occuring phenomenon, capable of resisting lightsaber blows and direct blaster hits, and can even keep the wearer alive for shorter periods in vacuum. It is also heavily steeped in the Dark Side of the Force, and will increase the power of anyone who tries to use such powers while wearing it.

</details>

**Lightsaber Combat** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Under Exar Kuns tutelage, he constructed his own lightsaber from random material in the Temple, resulting in a saber hilt made from black ore with a syntethically produced crystal, producing a fine cutting blade. The second blade was one he took from the Sith apprentice he killed on Yavin 4. He has modified the two weapons with an interlocking mehanism to allow him to utilize the full power of the fighting style he learned from Kun. He is also skilled in the art of hand-to-hand fighting, often complementing his lightsaber attacks with powerful kicks or tackles. In combat he fights with little finesse, executing powerful and lethal lightsaber strikes to put pressure on his opponent right from the start. Not one to prolong combat if it can be avoided, he channels his hatred and rage into combat, creating a devastating wave of destruction that few can withstand.

</details>

**Force Abilities** <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

Preferring to meet his opponents up close, he has trained mainly in the physical aspects of the Force, and relies much upon the Dark Side of the Force to grant him the power he needs to bring down his opponents. Not completely handicapped in the area of Force combat, he usually assaults his opponents with flying debris or dark lightning.

Not too bad, but judging from his background, I'd say his abilities would be higher. But that's just me.

I just chose level 7 as an example. But since I posted it, I´ve been thinking a bit, and decided to revise the build a bit...I´ll probably post it up later.
But was there anything specific you were thinking of?
