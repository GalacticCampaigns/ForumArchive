# Character Build

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-06 22:32:14)

I have a character concept/build that I'm working on, and I'd like some input and opinions on build optimization.
The general game info: 36 Point Buy, 7th Level, only "official" Saga sources for classes, feats and such.
The concept: A female Twi'lek growing up on the fringe, who is suddenly captured by slavers and sold into bondage as an exotic dancer. Years later, after a string of harsh and abusive masters, she escapes and begins training herself to be more self reliant. She is tough as leather, but at the same time she has a rough sort of kindness about her.
Basically, the build I'm looking to optimize her for is Melee Combat, in particular Martial Arts. She uses her body as a weapon, as it's the only weapon that can't be taken away from her. While she has training with other weapons, her preferred method of combat is hand-to hand. She combines her toughness with the grace of a dancer.
I'm looking for a mixture of Scout and Scoundrel levels, mixed in with some Soldier. I was thinking perhaps a Two Weapong Fighter, wielding an Electrostaff.
I was thinking Scout 3/Scoundrel 3/Soldier 1 at 7th level, but I'd be open to different suggestions.

UPDATE: The character level has been updated to 9th. I was thinking Scout 3/Scoundrel 3/Soldier 3. Suggestions?
EDIT: I'm now thinking of dropping the Scout levels and going with Scoundrel 4/Soldier 5.

To be quite honest, we can't help optimize a build we can't see. Telling us how many levels of X class you take isn't all that helpful, as compared to "I want her to have Y talent, and A, B, C skills." It would be even better if you actually laid out your proposed build, so we can see where to go from there.

I agree with Radon, if you could show more of how you had planned on taking levels, talents, feats, etc, we can help you better.
Still, from the sound of the concept, IÂ´d say donÂ´t ditch Scout. If you want a tough and self-reliant character, Scout is the way to go. It adds a lot of skills to fit that concept(Endurance, Survival, Jump, Climb, Swim), gives Shake it Off as a bonus feat, and has talents like Evasion, Fringe Savant, the Awareness tree and other useful things.

Yeah, I was going to pick up Scout again later. My current idea is to go Scoundrel 2/Soldier 7, pick up the feats I need for Elite Trooper, then alternate levels of Scout and Elite Trooper.
This is what I have so far:
Race: Twi'lek
Str 14, Dex 16, Con 16, Int 14, Wis 12, Cha 16
Acrobatics, Deception, Endurance, Initiative, Perception, Persuasion, Stealth
1. Scoundrel 1 (Talent: Fortunes Favor?, Scoundrel's Starting Feats (Point Blank Shot, Weapon Proficiency (Pistols, Simple)), Martial Arts I)
2. Scoundrel 2 (Bonus Feat: Weapon Proficiency (Advanced Melee))
3. Soldier 1 (Talent: Melee Smash, Soldier Starting Feat: Armor Proficiency (Light), Level Feat: Weapon Focus (Advanced Melee Weapons))
4. Soldier 2 (Bonus Feat: Dual Weapon Mastery I)
5. Soldier 3 (Talent: Stunning Strike)
6. Soldier 4 (Level Feat: Martial Arts II, Bonus Feat: Skill Training (Endurance))
7. Soldier 5 (Talent: Weapon Specialization (Advanced Melee Weapons))
8. Soldier 6 (Bonus Feat: Dual Weapon Mastery II)
9. Soldier 7 (Talent: Devastating Attack (Advanced Melee Weapons), Level Feat: Armor Proficiency (Medium))
I was thinking of swapping my Level 1 Scoundrel talent for Dastardly Strike.
Her weapons would consist of Combat Gloves, an Electrostaff, and two Heavy Blaster Pistols for ranged combat.

If whoever you're GM is/will be allows outside homebrewed classes and prestige classes, I would recommend the Martial Artist prestige class on WizO Tao's website found here: <!-- m -->[http://saga-edition.com/prestige-class/](http://saga-edition.com/prestige-class/ "http://saga-edition.com/prestige-class/")<!-- m --> ... artist.php

I would go with Scout at first level, and pick up Long Stride; you *want* to cover as much ground as you can to get the the baddie as fast as possible. Evasion is another great bonus, for those pesky grenades that will be thrown your way. You get 6 more hit points, good Reflex like a Scoundrel, a bonus to your Fortitude Save (which affects your Damage Threshold, but this is over ridden by the Soldier class), one extra trained skill, Shake It Off (which is neat) and trained in rifles. You do lose out on Acrobatics, though...
Taking a second level in scoundrel gets you...nothing really. Best just skip it.
So, I would suggest:
1. Scout 1 (Base Feats)...Martial Arts...*Sprint*
2. Soldier 1 (Light Armor).....................*Melee Smash*
3. Soldier 2 (Point Blank)...Adv. Melee....
4. Soldier 3 .....................................*Stunning Strike*
5. Soldier 4 ...................Med. Armor...
6. Soldier 5 (Dual Wep I)....................*Devastating Attack*
7. Soldier 6 ...................WF (Adv Me).
8. Soldier 7 .....................................*Weapon Focus (Advanced Melee)*
9. Elite Trooper!
(Martial Arts II).................*Greater Weapon Focus (Advanced Melee)*
This will set you up for Greater Devastating Attack, which makes makes that staff more fun, and using Stunning Strike much more likely. You could exchange Martial Arts with Dual Weapon Mastery II, but you lose out on having both.
Or, if you can get yer GM to buy off on it, instead of straight Soldier, see if you can multi-class into Jedi, but take Martial Arts instead of Lightsaber- but only for a few levels. Pick up Acrobatics while you are there, and take a few goodies from the Jedi Guardian tree (Elusive Target and Resilience are okay, but don't go looking for anything that requires Use the Force...unless you want that aspect). Then slip into Soldier to finish it up. You lose a talent or two, and maybe a feat, but you keep the BAB and Hit points, and get a bump to any save not already at +1.

The particular GM of this game is not big on "non-cannon" sources. I've already tried the PrC's from that site with him, and he has said that he'll consider them for future games, but not this one. So, thanks for the suggestion, but it's already vetoed. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->

You are missing the whole point of the build. If I was going to go for a straight fighter type, I would build either a Scout-Soldier-Elite Trooper, or a straight Soldier-Elite Trooper, with (maybe) a small side trip into the Jedi class to pick up a few items, and I wouldn't have even bothered posting here. I'm not building a straight fighter.
Several of the Scoundrel skills (notably Acrobatics, Deception and Persuade) are basically critical for the build, as they essentially make up the "background" abilities of the character: She is an escaped Slave who was an exotic dancer/"prostitute" and decided to put the physical abilities she had developed from that to use in developing her personal combat style. My GM uses the Deception and Persuade skills to govern the things that such a person would be doing (like dancing) so they are quite critical to the concept, which fails completely without them. Hence taking my first character level in Scoundrel. The second level was taken to gain the bonus feat.
Additionally, the GM does not allow a character to trade off feats for other feats when multiclassing. The ONLY thing you get to trade off feats for is for another trained skill, and then you can only do this when multiclassing and you need to choose one of the trained skills of the new class. I didn't do this with my build because I need the Armor Proficiency (Light and Medium) feats to access Elite Trooper.
This is why I took Endurance as a trained skill: My next two levels are going to be Elite Trooper and Scout, and I'll be able to take Shake it Off as my Bonus Level 1 Scout feat.
Thirdly, you mention that the character would gain Rifle proficiency, which is a problem: I didn't even want Pistol proficiency, but I had to take it as there is only one class that doesn't get it a first level. So I figured that since I had it, I might as well put it to some use.
The GM has basically said that I can do the "Jedi Dip" thing, even without Force Sensitivity, to aquire a couple of the talents. But his words on the subject were something along the lines of "every level you take, you need to tell me what you're doing with it and I reserve the right to refuse at any time."

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-08 07:30:50)

since you name three Scoundrel-only skills as a requirement for this build, IÂ´d actually recommend starting as a Scoundrel. It will cost you in Hp mostly, but it will get you those skills cheaper.
My suggestion is
Startin Stats: Str 15 Dex 14 Con 13 Int 13 Wis 12 Cha 16 (racial modifiers applied)
Scoundrel 1 -> Point Blank Shot, Martial Arts I, WP(Simple, Pistol), Skills(Deception, Acrobatics, Persuasion, Perception, Initiative), FoolÂ´s Luck
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 1 -> AP(Light), Melee Smash
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 2 -> AP(Medium), Rapid Strike
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 2 / Scout 1 -> +INT(train Endurance), +CON, Shake it Off, Evasion
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 2 / Scout 2 -> WP(Adv Melee)
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 3 / Scout 2 -> Stunning Strike, Martial Arts II
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 4 / Scout 2 -> Weapon Focus(Unarmed)
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 5 / Scout 2 -> Devastating Attack(Unarmed), +STR, +DEX
Scoundrel 1 / Soldier 5 / Scout 2 / Elite Trooper 1 -> Greater Weapon Focus(Unarmed), Martial Arts III

> You are missing the whole point of the build.

Damn, man. Every time you respond to one of my posts, I feel like your attacking me. I'm not offering up suggestions and advise to get slashed at.
You wanted an optimized build...
> Basically, the build I&#39;m looking to optimize her for is Melee Combat, in particular Martial Arts.

That's what I gave. Apparently, you didn't like it, which is fine. Sheath the claws.
In other news:
Melee fighter using Scoundrel as a base strike me as a really bad idea. That's 12 hit points lower than a Soldier, and it just gets worst from there. Unless you're going the defensive route, your poor twi'lek is going to get hammered while she gets into melee. Unless...well, if she is trained in Acrobatics, and moves while fighting defensively, she'll have a +10 to her Reflex defense. So, that route, she can slowly cross an open field to her attackers, so that might work.
Still, she's gonna get hit. Hm, but you made her tough (Con 16) so again, that might not be so bad. I'd try to get Shake It Off sooner than later, and maybe Improved Damage Threshold. You have describe her as plenty tough, but other than just a good Con score, there is nothing to show that, so maybe those two would work.
Also, getting multiple melee attacks is very difficult in Star Wars. While the image is undeniable, the practice is...less than wonderful. You *may* want to dump Dual Weapon Mastery for Acrobatic Strike and Power Attack. "She gracefully slips to the thugs left, using her arc to build up speed to deliver a telling strike" kind of thing. Acrobatic Strike gives you the fluid, graceful movements of the dancer, while Power Attack shows how that grace can be turned into a deadly strike.
I still advocate getting Long Stride as soon as possible, just to close the distance faster. The longer you're not in melee, the longer your not preforming your exquisite concept.
And **DarthAnthrax**, unless they errata'ed it, Elite Trooper needs a BAB of +7, and your build has only +6

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-08 11:51:22)

I always run with fractional BAB. So Scoundrel 1 + Scout 2 = +9/4 BAB = +2.5 BAB.

Ah. That make more sense now. My mstake; I didn't even think of fractional BAB. Also, now it looks really good. I may just steal your build later, when no one is looking.

Except for the fact that I'm not going with an Unarmed focused character. Not anymore anyway. If you read the build that I posted above, you might've noticed that most of my abilities are focused around Advanced Melee Weapons. Secondly, your build's Con is too low. Too low by at least 2 points of modifiers. I went with a higher Con to build up some badly needed HP, and to get Damage Threshold up.

How is pointing out the truth of the situation attacking you? You *did* miss the point of the build. If you felt like I was making a direct attack against you, I apologize. But I can assure you that I wasn't.

If you read the Skills list, you'll notice that Acrobatics is the first on said list.

The plan is to get Shake it Off in two levels, and then focus most of my remaining feats on "toughening up" the character with Toughness, Improved Damage Threshold, and poosible Iproved Defenses. It's also one of the reasons I chose Twi'lek: +2 Fort Defense gives you a +2 Damage Threshold.

The way my GM plays the bad guys is that they often use Full Attacks as well, or they attack in large numbers, or whatever. Dual Weapon Master will be useful as often as it wont, which is why I selected it. Given the effect that Power Attack has on your attack bonus, I would say that I'll get more use out of Dual Weapon Mastery, to be quite honest.
> I still advocate getting Long Stride as soon as possible, just to close the distance faster. The longer you&#39;re not in melee, the longer your not preforming your exquisite concept.

That was going to be one of my next aquisitions actually. Basically, my next two levels would be Elite Trooper 1 and then Scout 1. With my Scout level, I was going to pick up Shake it Off and Long Stride.
> I always run with fractional BAB. So Scoundrel 1 + Scout 2 = +9/4 BAB = +2.5 BAB.

My GM, unfortunately does not. "No non-cannon sources" means no optional rules, or anything else that isn't either in the book, or in the official erratta.

If your GM does a lot of standing still and full attacking, then it would actually be better to create a mobile character. Hit and fade away, getting the full measure of your single attack, while limiting their requirement for their focus: multiple attacks. Squeeze Running Attack in there, and you smash one guy into itty-bitty pieces, and end your movement threatening some one else. Spread the love!
And I guess it's yer turn to fail to see the point. Acrobatic strike, when you tumble up to a target, grants a +5 to attack. Considering yer BAB isn't going to be low, you really don't need this. So you transfer it into power attack. Using a single, two handed weapon, that translates into +10 damage. Stack that with devastating attack, stunning attack, a Force Pike and at 9th level you are dealing (using your stats) 2d8+4 (str) +2 (Specialization) +4 (level) +10 (power attack), or 2d8+20, averaging 29 points of damage. That much damage plus Stunning strike drops most folks two levels down the condition track without even trying. And that is at your *full* base attack bonus (Use the stun setting, and you are dropping him three levels on the Damage Track while doing 14 points of real damage to him).
Compared to your two weapon fighter with a electro staff:
2d6+2 (str) +2 (specialization) +4 (level), pr 2d6+8 per strike, averaging 15 points of damage, provided you hit (cause you still have -2 to both strikes).
In the end, you will be able to use Acrobatic Strike & Power Attack almost every round you are within charging distance of a foe, and hit almost all the time, dealing quite a bit of damage, dropping him down the condition track twice, and keeping with your dancer concept.
Unless the foes come running up to you instead of, ya know, staying back and shooting, you will, at most, use your two weapon fighting style once every other round. (though this does fits the dancer concept as well).
Other things:[ul]
[*]I noted you have acrobatics, hence why I said it wasn't so bad 'cuz you can move defensively.  
[*]You asked for a melee focused build, I gave you one. Then you said I had it all wrong. Right, so there was a miscommunication. Let's say I screwed up there, and that way it's all dropped.  
[*]Your "toughing up" of your character must take place after 9th level, because I didn't see it. This is not an issue to me, save it seems to counter your original idea of a tough girl. But, hey, your concept, right? (duly noted on the twi'lek fortitude bump. Never actually noticed that part. Pretty cool. However, ever thought about going Human, and using that extra feat on Improved Damage Threshold? That's a bigger boost in that area).  
[*]A melee fighter in a setting dominated by ranged weapons is in for some serious hurt. If you don't have Long Stride at first, then consider taking Stealth as a trained skill. With your information gathering skills, you should be able to discover an impending ambush/attack before it happens, and you could move all sneaky like close to the baddies. Or at least, slip off to the side and stealth your way out of the line of fire.[/ul]
