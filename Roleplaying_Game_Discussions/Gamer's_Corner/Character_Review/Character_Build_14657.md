grp is 3
and why did you choose armor proficiency if you have no armo? that, and you can't have both armor proficiency and point blank shot at 1st
and bludgeon should be removed, as well as the special actions and force powers known line (as you have none of either)
and ref is 17 (flat-footed 14)
not bad for a first timer. not bad.
