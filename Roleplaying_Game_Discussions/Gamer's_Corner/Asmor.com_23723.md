In case you haven't heard about this site:
<!-- m -->[http://www.asmor.com](http://www.asmor.com "http://www.asmor.com")<!-- m -->
It has a bunch of utilities for RPG's in general and D&D4e in specific. I've found the latter programs to be really nice for a few games I've run.

Interesting site. I must say I might have to contact him about using his dice roller on this site, instead of the old WoTC one.
