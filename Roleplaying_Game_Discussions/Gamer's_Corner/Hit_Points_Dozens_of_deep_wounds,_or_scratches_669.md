# Hit Points: Dozens of deep wounds, or scratches?

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-05 19:21:29)

This is one element of many RPGs that I've never really liked folks. Hit points. Their reason for being invented and why the number goes up and up over levels was sound, but so often I find people not really using it in that way.
The idea of course was that if your character is anything above 1 hit point, he's just fine. You the player could declare that she is injured a bit or cut up some, but until you hit 0 or below, you are doing fine. Which means that when that orc/ewok/thug 'hits' you and deals that 2d6 points of damage or whatnot, as long as that damage didn't bring you to 0 hit points then you could declare a couple things as having just happened.
1. He missed. Very, very close shave, but he missed. Maybe you dodged at the very last second, parried with a lightsaber, bent your neck back just a centimeter etc.
2. Tiny graze. It's a scratch, skittering off the armor or a itty bitty cut on the arm or whatnot.
Now of course in Saga we have those nice Thresholds that help to define wounds some. If you sustain a hit that does greater damage than your Threshold then your character HAS taken a hit. It is however, not a serious wound. Since you can dedicate a full round (3 swift actions) to 'recover' yourself. So this could mean a bit deeper cut than normal, or getting smacked in the face with the broadside of a vibroaxe and stunned a bit.
The downside is that so often in the past, I've seen people in a storytelling style describing that 22 point axe hit on the paladin as some kind of serious blow! Despite that the 22 points are actually accounting for less than 10% of the hero's hit points and he's still got 80 or so left. I find those kinds of games just go downhill fast as huge wounds that don't actually have an effect on gameplay pile up.
So that's my quick semi-bored rant. What are your thoughts on how HPs are/should be handled in gameplay, pnp, pbp, and virtual table formats?

Well, I'm of the same frame of mind as you (that is exactly what they're meant to represent).
The problem I've found, in practice, is the confusion that describing hits as misses creates during play. If a GM tells a player that the Orc missed them, then follows it with "take 9 damage", the player wonders where the damage came from.
Especially since they're called "HIT points". They'd be much better off renamed "Dodge points" or something similar.

Several games use a Damage save, rather than actual hitpoints.
And the old 3.5 version of Star Wars D20 as well as several other systems use the Vitality and Wound system.
I happen to like BOTH of these ideas, once understanding the Vitality/Wounds system. Where it matters not if you've got 57 vitality, if you've taken enough critical hits that go directly to wounds and you are negatives there, you have taken SERIOUS damage and are dead and/or dying.
The damage save is a complete lack of hit points, where you have a bonus you can roll to make a certain DC. The DC is generally 15+total damage done. This can be nice, as smaller less 'damaging' blows can land in just the right spot to take someone down.
David and Goliath for instance.
Do you really think a little rock did enough damage to reduce Goliath to -1, OR did enough damage to get past his Damage Threshold?
I'm digging the SAGA system. It is a curious mix of everything. I'd like to play it more, obviously, before giving a thumbs up or thumbs down on it. I've played 1 3 hours scenerio besides starting in games here. So I really have NO experience with it.
Just throwing in my 2 cents.

I don't have much practical experience with systems, just read most of the rules for most of the Major RPG's. I have to say I agree about DM/GM descriptions, I myself am bad about that. But not all DM/GM's do that.
In my game for instance. Red got hit hard enough to move him -1 down the condition track. I would say thats a fairly decent hit. So in the description I made sure to mention it loosened a bit of his hardware. I felt that was a good description under the circumstances.
You have to be hit to take damage, so the miss or very close miss I can't agree with. I think of Pro Wrestling in this instance (which I hate with a bloody passion). A huge guy gets hit with a metal chair, and in the head no less. But it doesn't appear to phase him. That is where threshold comes in (hopefully at any rate). While he was hit, I'm sure he took damage. Enough of that damage builds up and you go unconscious.
Hopefully this post made since. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Great discussion!

Give yourself a papercut. Now try and use that hand, for anything really. Fire a pistol, file some paperwork, cook dinner, play Halo 3, whatever.
You quickly note that even a tiny wound can really interfere with your ability to perform a lot of tasks, so a 'fairly decent hit' is not a part of a -1 move on the condition track. That does account for an actual hit yes, but that could be anything from a scratch to a slight burning of the arm such as Princess Leia receives during the battle on Endor. It hurt, it made life more difficult, but it wasn't a telling wound that would prevent someone from continuing their tasks.
Now of course further drops down the track can either be the cumulative effect of such minor hits ala the 'death of a thousand papercuts' or if it's all from a single nasty Scoundrel/Bounty Hunter etc it's a single bad hit. The hit points removed may not even remotely threaten the life of the character, but he's knocked near to being senseless or IS actually wounded in a manner that will cause his companions concern. Getting hit with a blaster cannon can do that to a person. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
And remember, the original intent of hit points (especially hit points increasing with each level) is that the overall luck and skill of the character ensures that when an enemy 'hits' them the actual strike is 'absorbed' by the character's skill and luck in battle. The last second parry, the head tilting 2 milimeters to the left avoiding more than a mild burn etc. But even a great hero's luck runs out eventually, leading to her being unable to avoid that one blow that *does* end her heroic fight.

They can represent misses: In fact, they've done so since they first started being used in D&D. They can also be glancing blows, naturally.
The definition from Saga (page 146):
"[Hit points] represent the ability to take physical punishment and keep going, and the ability to turn a serious blow **into a graze or near miss**."
Emphasis added by me. See? <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Now to continue contributing to the discussion - The definition continues:
"As you become more experienced, you become more adept at parrying strikes, dodging attacks and rolling with blows such that you minimize or avoid significant physical damag trauma, but all this effort slowly wears you down."
So though physical punishment was mentioned in the first sentence, the rest of the definition puts clear emphasis on that fact that in this context "physical punishment" represents fairly insignificant blows.
Indeed, the very existence of Damage Threshold (defined on the same page: the important bit is as follows - "attacks that deal massive amounts of damage [that] can impair or incapacitate you regardless of how many hit points you have remaining") demonstrates that hit points aren't meant to model major hurts - a separate mechanic encompassing Damage Threshold and the Condition Track exists to do that.
For my final thought, check out the picture on page 147, which sits alongside the rules for Damage Threshold. The Duros there has had a fairly small arm wound, but it's clearly impairing his ability to act. That's a guy who's been hit for over his Damage Threshold and been knocked down the Condition Track right there. And if a small wound like that counts as major enough to do Condition damage, it follows that anything that just deals hit point damage must be less significant.

I donÂ´t have all that much experience, but hereÂ´s my take on what is defined a hit (as in an actual physical hit):
Any attack that puts you down the CT because, as has already been pointed out, it somewhat impairs your ability to act. A hit that doesnÂ´t pass your DT in damage I would think to be an attack that didnÂ´t physically connect, but rather forced me to strain more than normally to avoid it making serious damage. A hit that passed the DT in damage or otherwise put you down the CT I would say that it was something that physically connected. A shot taken to the arm or shoulder, a sword in the side, or a kick in the kidney (and that can be very impairing).

You could, and I often use descriptions of this kind. They make a lot of sense in context.

Now think about it another way.
Does Luke Skywalker become resistant to physical harm as he levels up in the trilogy? If you put a blaster against his chest and pulled the trigger when he was level 1, or level 14 hitting him full on and at point blank range I mean. Would not in both cases his blastered corpse fall over dead from such a blow? And yet he gets more HP as he levels up. Another example I love to use from this is Conan. Really now, does Conan obtain the ability to be skewered with a spear and laugh it off because he has more hit points than the spear's attack and deal? Or does he gain the experience in battle he needs to make that spear thrust a near miss scratch, of which too many scratches will slow him down and tire him out to the point where he cannot resist that final, terrible thrust.
Now I know there are plenty of people who would read these very rules in Saga and come to a stunning conclusion...
"You know, I'm playing a level 1 Soldier with 30 hit points, and that storm trooper just tossed a Frag grenade midst my party. In any (and I do mean any) story context if I dove on that grenade to save my friends from it, I would die. But I have 30 hit points and the max it can do is 24 meaning a -1 on the condition track and 6 hit points left at worst! I dive on the grenade!"
You have to ask yourself, is this the kind of gameplay you want? Especially when the characters get up in higher levels and decide they can 'walk slowly' into the face of a blaster cannon doing 3d12 per hit and not even *try* to avoid being hit because their hit points can absorb the 3-4 hits before they 'walk slowly' up to it and slice it out of action, following the use of a talent to recover themselves fully of course.

As true as what you say is, I donÂ´t think we are meant to think about it that way. The extra hit points gained from level ups are meant to represent gaining more experience at avoiding attacks being harmful to you (in any way that has already been menitioned).
But I also find myself thinking along these lines, and would like to see some more rules to better cover things that should be insta-kills but as you've pointed out, are not always.
However if I were to try and fit those situations into the current rules, maybe you could say that since you completely surronuds the grenade, you now effectively becomes its AoE. So instead of exploding in the normal area, all that damage would apply to you, wich would mean x4 damage (it is a 2x2 square, right?)
