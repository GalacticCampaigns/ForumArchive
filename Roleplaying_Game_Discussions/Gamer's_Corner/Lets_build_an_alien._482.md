# Lets build an alien.

### **master_Tru** (2007-09-30 18:53:22)

Hey need a new alien for your game but not sure what to use. Tired of all the obvious choices want something new?
Well lets build one together by popular vote and see what we come up with. We will start by voting on the type of alien:
1. Reptilian
2. Avian
3. mammal
4. Aquatic
5. Vegetable
6. Insect
7. Near human
8. Other
Cast your vote <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

### **Rowen** (2007-09-30 18:54:37)

Ill go for near human.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-30 18:55:30)

Yeah, let's make this first one an easy experiment. I'll second the "Near-human" motion.

---

### **Thandrim** (2007-09-30 19:27:19)

Near human is good. I can't stand veggies you know.

---

### **Anonymous** (2007-09-30 21:32:29)

3... I want to develop cat-girl race.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-01 00:39:51)

always liked reptilians

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-03 08:23:53)

Ok near human would be a good first start I will vote that way as well. It looks like it might be near human, get your voyes in if you want to work on something different <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-05 15:09:14)

Ok so far it is 4 for near human, 1 mammal and 1 reptile. I will keep the vote up until sunday.

---

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-05 15:44:35)

I'll go with near-human.
I agree, let's get into the groove and start 'easy' before moving on.

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-08 18:05:04)

5 for near human, 1 mammal and 1 reptile:
Near human wins the first round <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Now lets vote on racial advancement:
1: tribal, stone age, basic
2: industrial
3: advanced space fairing
4:other

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-08 18:15:58)

IÂ´d vote for advanced. Would be nice to come up with a highlt advanced race with maybe a few unique technical advancements

---

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-08 20:29:51)

I'm gonna vote for industrial. For some reason I have steampunk in my head again, so it'd be awesome to get it out with a "cyberpunk" themed race.

---

### **Rowen** (2007-10-08 20:43:44)

industrial could be interesting. So Ill have to go for that one.

---

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-08 21:57:57)

:
I actually vote for Tribal. (Despite Industrial in the lead)
Yes, this could be seen as a vote to start from the very basics and work up. (Which I do enjoy)
But there is something to be said about the complexities and intricacies of a tribal society and how castes, genders, and 'professions' work with one another. Not to mention the thought of does a Tribal society rear it's young communinally, or individually? Why are they Tribal in the first place? Is it environment? Or is it a fall from a greater empire? Or is it simply a new civilization budding? Or perhaps colonists reverted after crash-landing on the planet aeons ago....

### **Anazider** (2007-10-08 23:58:33)

My vote is for other, with that other being a Feudal society with smatterings of technological advances.

You're more than welcome to your choice, but you seem to be implying non-tribal societies can't be complex and intricate, and we couldn't ask many of those questions and myriad others besides about the other options.
Who's to say an advanced species doesn't have a caste system and communally raise their young? <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 09:38:13)

Sorry, don't mean to say other societies are not complex. I'm saying that Tribal societies generally are more complex than first viewed. Since they are 'supposed' to be simple, hand to mouth, etc. It's a nice twist, in my opinion.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-09 09:45:56)

> I&#39;m saying that Tribal societies generally are more complex than first viewed.

Very fair, I couldn't agree more. I actually would like to build a tribal race that was also an advanced culture rather than a primitive one (and maybe the latter term is the one we should be using for the context of this poll).

---

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 10:00:33)

I'll agree with that!
If we can do 'tribal' or 'clans' in an advanced society! I'm willing to change my vote.
If not, well, I sort of like that fuedal society just advancing in technology. Are you thinking 'steam punk' Anazider?

When I read that I thought of the Nox from Star Gate. Atleast I think they were called the Nox

---

### **chibiamy** (2007-10-09 11:11:33)

Yes, and they were what... the 3rd race?
The ancients being the first.
The Asgard being the 2nd.
The Nox being the 3rd?
Something else was the 4th.
And Humans are the 5th 'race'.
Okay, there are wholes there, but the sheer fact I KNOW this scares me.

---

### **Alicia** (2007-10-09 11:56:15)

I vote for a Feudal society. That could be very interesting.

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-09 12:00:08)

I guess what I was trying to get voted on was the level of tech the race is currently at. We can vote on governments later <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I was thinking something more along the lines of a race in the earliest stages of hyperdrive and laser technology. Starships still resemble the seafaring vessels of previous ages, and the latest advances in technology belong to royalty and the social elite.

### **Anonymous** (2007-10-13 16:58:23)

Since I'm WotC's resident Grebleips supporter, I've got to say that if this project ever expands to include Children of the Green Planet, I want to be invloved. most of the race is already established, they jsut need stats

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-17 06:56:36)

OK I vote for advanced:
That gives us a near human race at an advance level of tech. Next we should vote on is the nature of near human. Many near humans are indistinguishable from humans others have developed to meet the demands of one environment or another. So we should vote on what environment the alien has evolved to:
1: Basically human
2: Aquatic
3: Cold
4: Hot
5: Low gravity
6: High Gravity
7: Harm full gass
8: Other

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-17 06:57:21)

We will vote on government type next

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-17 07:42:10)

I vote for a cold environment.
I now have an idea of the alien I want...space-faring, advanced-tech VIKINGS :

---

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-17 11:30:56)

I too vote for cold, though for entirely different reasons. :P

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-10-22 09:16:47)

Thats 2 for cold, so even if I went against the curve it would still be cold so cold wins. Next we will vote on overall government type:
1: Feudal
2: Democratic
3: Monarch
4: Communism
5: Tribal
6: Other

### **DarthAnthrax** (2007-10-22 09:31:52)

I vote for tribal/others. I got really attatched to my vikings idea, so even if thatÂ´s not what we end up doing here, IÂ´ll probably give it a shot myself

---

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-22 12:17:34)

Tribal.

---

### **ganthet** (2007-10-22 12:38:25)

Tribal and Feudal. If I can vote for more then one.

---

### **Rowen** (2007-10-22 20:07:57)

Tribal it is

---

### **master_Tru** (2007-11-05 08:21:18)

So thats 4 for Tribal and 1 feudal, Tribal wins. So we have a near human race on a cold enviroment, with a tribal belief system. The next thing to vote on would be the name of the race, so put up to ten name choices in a week or so we will vote on our favorites. Come on come all build an alien, new to the site or not we want your imput. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Let's kick this back into gear. Everyone can vote for up to four names from the lists, and from that we draw our winner. In the case of a tie, well, we'll decide that if there's a tie.
My four favourite names are:
Rotharak
J'sarik
Nythin
Gohk

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-17 10:27:01)

These are my votes:

Gohk

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-01-17 13:52:16)

From what I've seen said... it looks like:
J'sarik
Gohk
Are the ones folks want. So we need to decide between those two, right?

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-17 13:56:33)

Looks that way unless someone comes in with a vote that includes one of those but not the other.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-01-17 14:19:58)

I think we've given folks ample enough time to choose their four favourites, and we can't guarantee waiting for anyone else to do so will result in a tie-breaker. I suggest we now let people vote between the two most popular. Anyone can vote still, but we'll only wait as long as it takes the members who've been taking part in the name contest so far to make their votes before moving on to the next category.
Fair? If so I'm going to run with Gohk.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-17 14:49:49)

My vote goes for JÂ´Sarik

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-18 00:22:32)

JÂ´Sarik

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-28 18:50:44)

JÂ´Sarik it is <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
We should now begin a brief historical summery, who ever wants to put there spin on this is welcome. Keep in mind anything built here can be used in any setting including the Kalium galaxy, also I would like to see unique weapons equipment and ships for this race but we can tackle that later.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-29 06:22:48)

Let's re-cap.
A Near-Human species called the J'Sarik that is native to a cold environment which rule by a tribal government.
I'm trying to think what this species would look like, cold resistant? or just cold adaptive? Curious to how others will ultimately envision the species.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-29 07:36:04)

I was thinking pale skin and white hair would be common (but otherwise human like), what does everyone else think this alien would look like?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-29 08:54:57)

Gaah, I just canÂ´t get the image of SW Viking out of my head. So IÂ´ll just work with that:
The JÂ´Sarik is a near-human species, originally nothing more than humans, but great wars in the past forced them to seek refuge on the cold tundra world of ___(well, this we can also discuss later). Hunted as they were, they were forced to adapt quickly to the harsh environment, and learn how to fight to defend their new sanctuary. Living on the harsh tundra has hardened these humanoids against the cold, and they have developed into a tribal society were warring between the tribes is not uncommon. This has turned them into capable fighters, but has unfortunately somewhat isolated them from the rest of the Galaxy.
Years of hard living has set its mark on these warriors. They have developed a natural resistance to cold, and their physiology has adapted as well, providing them with heavy frames and an accelerated growth of hair. They tend to have a cold manner, being calm and in control, but they are also known to have short tempers.
**Possible Mechanical Benefits:**
+2 Con, -2 Dex, -2 Cha(unless people think near-humans should not have attribute modifiers) +5 fortitude defense against the effects of extreme cold
Rage (as the wookie trait)
Conditional Bonus feat(Skill Focus: Survival)
Sorry for bursting ot this many ideas at once :P

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-01-29 09:10:41)

Rutual tatoes would be cool, we could also work on a few tribal rituals depending of some of the history we create.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-01-31 06:53:55)

I like pale skin, I also like ritual tattoos.
I envision two species, both of them are survivors. Both have adapted to the cold, but one species live underground. Which brings me to another question, their home world. I guess we are going to have to create that as well. Going with my two species idea we could even call the second one's Gohk's. Since we all liked that name as well. One lives on the rugged harsh icy weathered surface and the other lives underground.
I know they are tribal, but how about we not make them all barbaric. More like nomads of there own world, they war to survive through the elements. Not necessarily between themselves, but against the beasts that overwhelm the planet. They could be the minority, almost extinct. That's not to say that there are a few tribes that wish to control everything and are tyrannical conquerers, but the majority are peaceful and just try to survive and live life best they can.
What about a biological primitive technology, where let's say they have a great understanding of medicinal properties of flora, fauna, and native beasts parts of there home world. An herbal understanding of chemistry. I wasn't thinking of a traditional warlike tribal society, but more of a chieftain that everyone respects and leads the tribe with his oracle (force sensitive) cleric on a peaceful mission of survival. This species could even be ancient, all the cities that once thrived were somehow destroyed or buried in an apocalyptic disaster.
I dunno, I'm just throwing ideas out there... maybe I'm getting off track. I am trying to visualize the ecology, species and government as a whole.

It was always my intent to build this from the ground up the planet the tech the culture everything.
Two race would be cool what does everyone else think on that?
The two race idea would follow the history I had in mind of a penial coloney that through an uprising and political turnoil was pushed aside and later forgoten leaving the inhabitants to fend for themsleves.
Over time I could see rare individuals learning the ways of the force even if only on a rudementry level, but becoming revered members of the nomadic people. These oracles could be some of the few who have permenante homes, seeking out the knowledge of the oracles one would offer tribute out of respect.
Just a few ideas of my own <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-02-29 13:25:45)

Two races sound cool, actually.
I'd say the one that lives underground has the pale skin, large luminecent eyes - (Gemstone colored?), but otherwise same build and same haircolor as the aboveground cousins. And the above ground hints more towards blue. The blue skin with white hair is a nice camoflauge if they live near glaciers. Otherwise, it's just silly but looks DANG COOL IN ARTWORK.
I like the nomad idea.
But here's another suggestion: small tribal settlements around volcanic vents? Provides warmth, energy, area for plants to be grown, as well as herds to be raised, etc. Sure it's dangerous if it's active... <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
I would think the Gohk would be more naturally disposed to force using traditions/abilities, living in an underground and dark environment, needing to stretch their senses further, etc.
A select few of the J'sarik have their own force abilities and traditions, likely revolving around foretelling destiny and good hunting areas, as well as weather prediction and healing?

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-01 07:08:15)

Settlements around volcanic vents is a great idea, these settlements should be the more stable ones where the nomadic tribes come to barter or buy supplies (depending on how we are going to do the economy).
Ice Glacier settlements would be neat too, Maybe we can make those underground settlements or even cities.
I think we have a fire and Ice theme going.. lol.. not my intention, but again just throwing ideas out there.
I like the underground, Gohk species being pale skinned and large luminescent eyes, and tribal tattooed.
Since they are underground are they going to have darkvision?
Again I like blue skin white hair J'sarik.
Would they have large luminescent eyes also? Maybe large dark eyes...

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-01 07:23:02)

I would see the J'sarik as having smaller eyes dark yes but smaller to help prevent snow blindness (no I am not making that up I am Canadian you can get that). Due to the obvious differences and the fact that the Gohk could only stand to be on the surface at night the two races may have clashed in the rare times they would have meet (if they ever meet at all). In their earlier histories the J'sarik would tell stories of the under demons, with their more hunter/tribal/nomadic ways the J'sarik could even have seen it as a right of passage to venture into the unknown dept of the land to face an under demon the reclusive Gohk.
The Gohk could be master farmers of fungi and mushroom, the underground home of the Gohk would be warmer then the surface and fertile. Developing their own form of force tradition (which we would build later) force users could be common amongst their race. As the J'sarik hunted them they would have learned that these strange demons possessed stranger powers when a J'sarik developed similar powers they would have become outcast into the wilds.
Just s slightly different way to go, another idea to add to the pot. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-01 10:35:55)

Some ideas on tech, to further seperate these races as aliens:
Sound; sonic blaster pistols, sound dampeners limited stealth technoligy (we can`t stray too far away from star wars tech). Within their frozen enviroment they would have developed tech based within sound to aid in detecting and preventing avalances as the race evolved so to would their tech.
<!-- m -->[http://www.atcsd.com/site/](http://www.atcsd.com/site/ "http://www.atcsd.com/site/")<!-- m -->
Geo Thermal; having their communal trade havens based aroud volcanic vents and hots spots would be a natural move towards the harrensing of geo thermal energy.
At some point we could create uniquie creatures for the planet itself, force talents and more <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-03-01 23:59:18)

Great ideas for Tech. Sound and Thermal, I like it.
Okay so we have The Gohk and J'sarik
Gohk are a pale skinned near-human race with large luminescent eyes (need to pick a color or say varies colors) that allow them to see in the dark. There skin is often covered with native tribal tattoos. These tattoos are very meaningful to the Gohk and often represent things like manhood, warrior, teacher or other personal meanings. The species has a special connection with nature, and are naturally disposed to the Force creating many force-sensitive Gohk. They live underground protected by the arctic surface of there planet, which suffers constant blizzards and extreme cold temperatures. The underground cities or settlements are close to Volcanoes and underground lava rivers causing high humidity and a warm temperatures. The Gohk harness the geo thermal energy of the Volcanoes, and have mastered sound technology using sonic weapons and sound dampeners; a technology developed to detect and prevent avalanches in the glacier regions. They are master farmers of fungi and mushrooms using the underground volcanic fertile soil that is enriched with natural mineral deposits from the Volcanoes.
J'sarik have small black eyes with double eyelids to protect them from the glare of the surface that can easily cause snow blindness without proper protection. They live on the surface of the planet surviving the extreme cold temperates and constant blizzards. The J'sarik are good hunters and fierce warriors?
I think we need more on the J'sarik guys... hehe
**Few Questions…**
*What is the outlooks of the two speices? Peaceful? Warlike?*
*Are both species native?*
DarthAnthrax brought up a good idea, that maybe one of the speices found the planet to start there civilization over. Then we can use my history idea of a huge Apocalyptic war/ natural disaster causing the species to almost go extinct. We could have ancient lost technology, cities, etc... buried underground. The animosity and tension between the two species would exist.
*Which one is going to have tribal tattoos? Both?*
*J'Sarik Skin color, glacier blue? Pale white?*
I do like the idea of glacier blue skin, but for some reason I'm thinking of a sea lion type of skin. Dark spotted with beady black eyes. We should fine tune the J'Sarik... we seem to have the Gohk pretty much down. If anyone has any more to add, suggestions ... let's hear them so we can make them even more detailed.
**Other Thoughts**
I like the idea of the J'sarik force-sensitives being exiled from society. The exiles could probably sense each other, and have created a force-sensitive nomadic J'sarik tribe.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-03-02 06:39:09)

I would say that the J'Sarik are near humans are rather humans that over time developed into a separate race (near human). The home world, which we will have to name as well when founded by the core worlds was used as a penal colony after an uprising political shuffle the project was abandoned leaving the J'Sarik to develop on their own.
I see the Gohk as the native race of the planet which would also help explain their deep connection to the planet. hey could at their core be a Peaceful race though after countless years of sharing the planet with the nomadic J'Sarik would have a hard time trusting outsiders. I like the Gohk having ritual tattoos and the J'Sarik using paint to represent events (war, the hunt, seasons etc ....) the paint would differ slightly from tribe to tribe but much could be told only by looking at a J'Sarik`s face (the season, day/night, if they where on a quest, if they where to be wed).
J'Sarik Skin color, glacier blue skin. Long fine pale white hair.
A twist on the force-sensitive J'sarik though being outcast some of them could be seen as seers sought out for wisdom and knowledge. They would be feared and the long journey to find one both dangerous and a right of passage at the same time. Remember many nomadic peoples wasted very little if anything at all.
Well thats my two cents for now this project is stating to come together <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
