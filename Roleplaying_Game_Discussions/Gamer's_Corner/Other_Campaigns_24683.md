Hey, does anyone know of any other good premade campaigns for Saga edition? I am running a Dawn of Defiance campaign with some friends but am considering running something different as well.

I'm not even sure if there are any other premade campaigns for SAGA. Barring that what about coming up with your campaign idea?

My friend has converted some campaign content from the WEG stuff. I'll try and get it from him.

Let me add this to the discussion :
WHAT IS
EVE OF DESTRUCTION?
Eve if Destruction is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set over one thousand years after the Battle of Yavin, the adventurers in the Eve of Destruction campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic Star Wars Roleplaying Game experience, set against the benevolence of the New Galactic Empire. The Eve of Destruction campaign takes the heroes all the way from 1st level up to 20th level and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain two levels per adventure. Gamemasters should feel free to use the Eve of Destruction adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.
If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the GM’s Primer, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.
And from the 1st Episode of this Campaign:
A Princess’s Pride is the first adventure in the Eve of Destruction campaign, which should take the heroes from 1st level through to 20th level in a continuous storyline designed to give players and Gamemasters a complete Star Wars Roleplaying Game: Saga Edition experience. The first adventure will get the heroes together and launch them down a path to making a big difference in the galaxy. The heroes should advance from 1st level to 3rd level by the conclusion of the adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes should become acquainted with one another, and travel to the remote planet of Saleucami to rescue a not-so helpless royal captive, the feisty Princess Tiffa.
Since I'm running Dawn of Defiance, I'd LOVE to PLAY in this one!
