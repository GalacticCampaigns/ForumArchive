# What do you want to see in a game?

### **ganthet** (2009-10-02 17:18:12)

This question has come up on the chat room a few times. What do you want to see in a game? What makes you interested in playing in a game? I guess this is a question of taste in what you like and don't like. I have played in a few games on here and I can say there are some I like and wanted to see continue and some that where ok but I could live without playing in. I also don't think this is a GM question either because without players there is no point to the game. So I want to know what you want.

One of the most important aspects (especially in PbP games), is that the GM is engaged and tries to make a good story. All too often I´ve seen players here on these boards make descriptive posts of how their characters makes their attacks, and then provided the necessary modifiers at the bottom of the post. And this in turn has resulted in something like "<Characters name> shoots at him and misses/hits". It feels a little bit like you should play battleship instead.

DarthAnthrax is correct the descriptor in the posts is as important as the story itself. If a player or GM can not immerse themselves into the game that individual will loss out on the experience. It is up to both the players and the GM to enjoy the game, you will only get out of a game what you put into it.
What DarthAnthrax is saying works from both sides player and GM. Too many times I have seen non descriptive posts and scratch my head as to why. The Gm for example might have this grand vision in his or her head of an encounter but that vision can not be assumed, if it is not posted the players will never get it. Same goes for the players you might have some heroic idea of how your character jumps into the fray to save the day. That vision will be yours alone if you fail to share it.

Like Tru said this goes for GM's as well.
Begin rant.
What gets me is the 2-3 sentence post from a player,(this doesnt happen very often with a gm as they have more to decsribe) The GM posts and other players post in the scene and all the person can come up with is 2 sentences. Come on. What about the characters thoughts, feelings. What they see and experience. There must be some reaction to the events that go on around them when othere talk to them. One of the other characters says something to draw a response/conversation and it either goes unanswered/ignored or 3 words are used to acknowledge it.
If thats the case play FtF. To me PbP is about description and engaging the character to the others in the group, surroundings, thought, feelings, senses.
End rant.
This is the only gaming I do. So I try and get the most out of it that I can. If others want to do a half-assed job there isn't really much I can do about it as a player except set an example and hope that they see the light.
I dont expect everyone to put in the effort that I do but if I at lease see the attempt/effort I'm satisfied.
End rant again. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

Well I guess that this a GM question as well. And you guys are right the GM should try to tell you what is happening as engaging as he or she can. I have played in games with both Yogi and Anthrax, and they are both great role players and bring a lot to the characters they create for the games they play in.
The other thing I guess I was looking for was style, setting, era, that sort of thing as well. Communication with players is something that is important as well. Oh and yes I have not left the fact that I have played with Tru as well. I like the game of his I am in at the moment and love the character I am playing. About what Yogi said in his post about only posting a couple of lines and call it good. I am hit or miss on this. Sometimes I can make really good posts and they are long and well written (if not poorly spelled),but sometimes I feel like I am rambling where only a few lines are needed, like in combat. But this is just my opinion on this. And yes I do agree that you should at least try to make the post as good as you can or why are you bothering to even post. So I guess I am trying to say without saying is that if you can't come up with at least a few good lines of reaction, dialog and whatever you should rethink why you are playing in a pbp game in the first place.

Like Yogi, this is the only gaming I do, and I also want to make it count.
In addition to what Yogi said about short posts, I´d just like to add that I think it depends on the context of the post. If I am just making a quick remark to someone, or the post is one of many in a longer conversation, short posts fits well, IMO. But when someone fails to EVER make a post longer than 2-3 sentences, then you can begin to wonder. But the same thing can happen when someone ALWAYS feels the need to write 5 section posts, even if he only has to answer a yes or no question.
Personally, I´ve also never really liked 100% when a GM needs to involve actual numbers and statistics in their posts. I´m sure this differs, but I don´t actually need to see the roll for any skill check I made, just the result. This is mostly aimed at combat posts though, where GM informs your exact attack roll, how much damage you did, and sometimes even stats for the enemies. It takes away from the "story" feel of the game.

Ganthet ... in my game never ever worry about rambling on and on. The worse case I will PM you saying something like: "Ok your character would not know that we need to change your post a lil .... etc ...." Then I will give you a few ideas and together we creat the post no worries. I have done this before and will do it again.
Like I said before you have ideas visions of your characters heroics, don`t leave us out. Both players and GM`s want in on this. The Star Wars movie would have sucked without all the chacters and this would be a DnD site without them. Every element of the story is important.

Well I guess when I am thinking like Dexter that I make my posts the way I think he would think. I have some large post when I am in his head. He is different from what I usually play. Dexter is a skill monkey, that is how I built him. I would love to pull Deel out of mothballs and play him again. He was set up as the ships mechanic. I guess the point of this is cause I want to run a game again and want input about what people would like to see.
