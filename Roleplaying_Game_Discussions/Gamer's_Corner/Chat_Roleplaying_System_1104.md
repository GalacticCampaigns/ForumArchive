# Chat Roleplaying System

### **simplyscribed** (2007-10-14 06:23:00)

The thing (well, one of many things) about d20 is that it isn't such a hot system for chat roleplaying. Constant reference of rules and tracking of minutiae can really drag the game down. But scribed, you may well be thinking, that happens in tabletop play too! Well yes, it does. But in tabletop play, the players are never too far from the snacks and are more than happy to mess about while you do the looking up. There's something fun for them to be doing in the meantime, is the point. If a player gets bored enough during a chat game to find something else fun to do, they may start loading flash videos on newgrounds or something of the sort. In short, your game has reached crisis point.
Many chat games are freeform, and that can work to a point. It starts to fail when you introduce any kind of plot and/or conflict, because it's hard to adjudicate what characters are capable of. Some games use a simple roll of the die, with the highest winning. That's nice and easy, and inarguably fair, but it does mean every character is the same as every other.
So what is ideally wanted is a system where characters possess that spark of individuality, that is also simple enough that the game won't be derailed by its mechanics. There are already systems out there that can manage this, but I was bored and made one myself. I present it here for your perusal - who knows, it may see use on this site some time. Maybe it won't even be me using it.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">The system which as yet has no name</span>
This is a system for use in a chat room with dice-rolling capability. You probably couldn't use it out of that format without getting rid of the rolls and simply comparing ranks. Well, I could, because I happen to own several d3s and d7s, but I imagine I represent a significant minority with regard to wierd dice and the ownership thereof.
Please note that the system is a lot easier than it looks (Ideally I'd use graphics rather than formulae to explain it). Also keep in mind that the "complicated" stuff happens *before* the chat game - once the GM has established the ground rules, the player has all the numbers they need to go through a pretty painless character creation and an even less painful play experience.
***Aside:** If you do remove the dice, for whatever reason, you will often find situations where two competing characters have the same rank. If the situation allows for it, you can declare a draw. If you want a clear winner, and in many cases there has to be one, I suggest the following tie-break solution: Each participant PMs the GM (or an appropriate neutral party) with one of the following words: "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". I expect you can work out how the winner is then determined.*
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Attributes</span>
Each character has a number of attributes. You can use whatever attributes you want to suit your game. For my model, I'll be using "Body", "Mind", and "Soul". Each attribute is assigned a rank which establishes how good it is. Each rank is part of a particular power level, as shown below (you can rename power levels to suit the genre):
**Sub-Human**
1, 2, 3
**Human**
4, 5, 6, 7
**Meta-Human**
8, 9, 10, 11, 12
**Super-Human**
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
**Etc. ad infinitum**
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25
Note that each power level has 1 more rank than the last. This accounts for an ever-widening degree of subtle variation between characters in the same power level. One Human might be more powerful than another, but the difference between them is slight compared to the difference between, say, Superboy and Superman. By the time you got to the power level for gods, whatever that might be, you would have more than enough ranks to account for divinites great and small.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Character Creation:** You have a certain number of points to spend on Attributes. First of all, the GM must set a Power Level for the campaign. Some characters may have abilities below or above that Power Level, but this is the level they expect most of the campaign's action to occur at. Your Attribute Point pool is equal to:
([The lowest rank in the campaign's power level] x [the number of attributes]) plus [the difference between the lowest rank in the campaign's power level and the highest rank].
*For example, in simplyscribed's fantasy campaign, he sets the Power Level at "Human" and is using the three Attributes "Body", "Mind", and "Soul". The amount of Attribute Points available to his players equals:
**(4 x 3) + 3** = 15
In his superhero campaign, he sets the Power Level at "Superhuman" but uses the same Attributes. The amount of Attribute Points available to his players now equals:
**(13 x 3) + 5** = 44*
Finally, if you use more than three attributes the extra points won't go as far, so add bonus points equal to
[the number of new attributes] x ([the difference between the lowest rank in the campaign's power level and the highest rank] / 3)
***For example, simplyscribed adds new attributes to his fantasy campaign:**
1 new attribute: 1 x (3/3) = 1
2 new attributes: 2 x (3/3) = 2
**For example, simplyscribed adds new attributes to his superhero campaign:**
1 new attribute: 1 x (5/3) = 1
2 new attributes: 2 x (5/3) = 1
etc.*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Skills</span>
A character also has a number of skills.
The skills used for a game are entirely up to the GM. The simpler the list, the better.
*simplyscribed decides to use the following skills for his fantasy game, choosing to group them according to utility:
Combat Skills: Attack [Body], Defense [Body]
General Skills: Acrobatics [Body], Deception [Mind], Knowledge [Mind], Perception [Mind], Persuasion [Mind], Stealth [Body]
Magick Skills: Abjuration [Soul], Conjuration [Soul], Divination [Soul], Enchantment [Soul], Evocation [Soul], Illusion [Soul], Necromancy [Soul], Transmutation [Soul]
In this campaign, a character uses whichever magick skill is appropriate to the school of the spell they want to cast. Your game could just as easily have a single all-purpose skill, "Magick".
Skills are not measured in the same way as Attributes, because they aren't used independently. Instead, they add their rank to an Attribute's whenever the skill is tested.
*For example, Marcus the Mage in simplyscribed's game has 5 ranks in Soul and 3 ranks in Evocation. When he casts* Magic Missile *he adds his ranks in Evocation to his ranks in Soul for a total of 8 ranks. This puts his skill in casting Evocation spells into the Meta-Human power level, so Marcus will always succeed at a test of Human level or lower relating to the Evocation school of magick.*
Usually, a skill will only ever add to one attribute. See the example list above. A GM may rule if they wish that a given situation requires the use of a skill with a different Attribute than normal.
————————————————————————————–
**Character Creation:** You have a certain number of points to spend on Skills. I recommend enough to allow the player to purchase 1 rank in 2/3 (rounded down) of the skills on your list.
*In simplyscribed's game there are 16 skills, so players get [(16 / 3) x 2 =] 10 Skill Points.*
————————————————————————————–
<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Specialties and Familiarities</span>
If you prefer a slightly more concrete idea of the capabilities of characters in your game, you can introduce Specialties and Familiarities to the system.
A Speciality is an aspect of a skill that the character excels in. For Attack, it may be a particular weapon; For Defense, it may be a particular kind of armour or shield; For Knowledge, it may be Flora and Faunae, Geography, or some other field.
A Familiarity meanwhile, is an aspect of a skill that the character is passable in.
You may choose a number of Specialties across your skills equal to [the amount of skills] / 8 and rounded down. You may choose a number of familiarities equal to the amount of skills.
Whenever you are tested in a specialty, increase your rank by 1. Whenever you are tested in a familiarity, use your rank. Whenever you are tested in an area which you are neither specialised in or familiar with, reduce your rank by 1.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">What to Roll</span>
What you roll depends entirely on your total rank for any given check (based on Attribute, any applicable Skill, and any circumstance bonus or penalty the GM feels like imposing). Determine the Power Level of the rank, then roll a die equal in size to the highest rank in that Power Level.
**Sub-Human:** d3
**Human:** d7
**Meta-Human:** d12
**Super-Human:** d18
**Etc. ad infinitum:** d25
When you roll the die, you're aiming to get your rank or below. Note that if the test is considered below your Power Level (ie. It is one that a character of a lower Power level could reasonably attempt) then you succeed automatically. You also automatically succeed if your final rank is equal to the die you would roll (if you have 7 ranks, for example, you don't need to roll). Of course, if a task considered appropriate to a Power Level higher than your rank, you fail automatically.
*For example, for Barry the Strongman bending an iron bar is a strain, but possible. He has a Body score of 6, so needs to get 6 or lower on a d7 to succeed. Superman can probably do it between thumb and forefinger. He simply doesn't need to roll.*
Assigning Power Levels to tasks is entirely a GM judgement call.

you should check out BESM, sounds like what you're describing, also known as the dX system or the tri-stat system, depending on who you're talking to

I know BESM, and that's where I got Body, Mind, and Soul from. I have tried running BESM in chat and it just doesn't work. I don't really think the two are particularly comparable - This is a vastly simpler system, and the similarities really end with Body, Mind, and Soul (which don't have to be the attributes used anyway).
