# My game situation...

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-27 16:03:39)

Hey, all
I've been a member of this forum for a few weeks now and I still can't seem to find a play-by-post that's accepting members. The only new game that has opened since I joined (the clone troop commando one) was filled quite quickly.
So I've decided to take a more aggressive stance. I really *really* want to get into a game! Below is just an example of the kind of characters I make. I'm not a power-gamer at all, some would even say I make weak characters, but *I* like my style so what else matters, right?

**Possessions** con props, datapad, fine clothes, hold-out blaster, fine clothes**Brief History** Mot's father, a quick scoundrel by the name of Dirk, was once a successful thief on his home planet of Balosar. After years of work he had built a well-established thieves guild with over a dozen active members, all of whom payed a tithe of all their ill-gotten gains to him. Dirk's major flaw was that he was too old-fashioned and didn't bother to get into the new cutting-edge equipment that made every scoundrel's life much easier. This proved to be his downfall, and a rival gang eventually turned his thieving mini-empire upside down, tossing Dirk out in disgrace in the process.
Mot isn't like his father in many ways. First of all, he would never pass up any opportunity to increase his influence, and so ignoring up-and-coming technological advances would be foolish. He also focused less on the hands-on aspect of skullduggery and instead utilizes his wits as well as his silver tongue; Mot is an accomplished con man.
Dirk is now a miserable drunkard, exiled to the barren planet of Tatooine to live the rest of his life in shame. Mot has basically given up on his father and seeks to create a new organization, but better than his dear old dad's. After all, he would be running it.
I really want to play. I hope someone out there could use me. (I wont necessarily play a character like this, by the way)

It's a nice character and I hope you find a game to play in. When I first got here, I had the same problem and couldn't find a game. It wasn't until DarthAnthrax invited me into one of his that I found one (and then, of course, a bunch of casting calls opened up over the next few weeks and I did get into one of those, too).
Anyway, you arrived right after I closed the casting calls to my game. However, if you're really that eager to get into one (and I know the feeling) I can ask my players if they mind squeezing another player in. We really haven't gone that far into it yet, so it shouldn't be a problem.
If you want to take a look at it, it's the "Infinities Saga" game in the Rebellion era.

Yeah, it can be tough to find a game to get in on. We canÂ´t naturally get more casting calls than we have people willing to lead games. ThereÂ´s a balance here though, since weÂ´ve had a lot of games that have started of and then died after a few weeks, for one reason or another, but mainly the GM disappeared. So in a way its better not to start a game than to start one you canÂ´t run.
Alternative is also to start a game of your own, that can be just as fun as playing in one. I know thereÂ´s a lot of GMs here that can run games with a huge amount of players, and maybe they can squeeze you into one of their games. I could perhaps squeeze you into the game IÂ´m running, but IÂ´ve settled for not running games with more than 4-5 characters and IÂ´m not really sure how many are active right now, but I know theyÂ´re at least 4. Of course, youÂ´d probably need a slightly more combat capable character than that one. It is a wargame after all.

I expect that when the Legacy Campaign Guide that a game or two may open up. I have been thinking about beginning one in that era of play. Having never been a GM makes me nervous though. We'll see.

I have posted a casting call in Kotor era.

I know it's a little late, but I want to thank you all for your help. It is much appreciated!

You're probably looking exclusively for Saga games, but my D&D 4e has been casting for a few months!
