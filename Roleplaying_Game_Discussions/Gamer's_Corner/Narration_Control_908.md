# Narration Control

### **Thandrim** (2007-10-10 00:50:53)

As things stand in most if not all of the current roleplaying campaigns going in the PbP threads, each highly valued and well worshiped : GM has considerable creative control over the characters with respect to round by round action in combat. Now for the most part this is all well and good. They give not only a rundown of what happened and in what order, but also creatively describe the action. Works well right? Sadly it's bumped up against my own pride and what I'm accustomed to. Make no mistake, I cannot and will not suggest that the GM's aren't doing it right. It's just not what I'm used to.
Being an old-school MUSHer, we have/had a slightly different method of telling the story of even round by round action. Just as normal the players will declare what they will do this round, the GM declares what the baddies are doing, and then dice are rolled or agreements struck as to who succeeds and fails with what. The difference comes into play here, and to translate into PbP terms, the GM simply informs us on who successfully did what to do whom etc without the creative input on actions concerning the PCs. The players then in their next post describe just how the result was achieved. This leaves the players in control of everything their characters do, without even risking the GM giving a description of an action or reaction that the player views as not fitting for the character.
It seems trivial and on several levels it is. But to old farts like myself who are used to deciding just how our characters failed to hit the Death Star from point blank range despite spending a Force Point, it can be very important in the telling of the story and representing our characters **our** way.
Possibly a good idea for change? Bad? Cookies? Discuss! I, Zod command it!

I get what youÂ´re saying, and I think it coule be one way to go.
However, I find myself liking the fact that in the GMÂ´s post you can always get a quick and easy summary of what happended the past round, whitout it breaking the "story-feel" too much. That said, I think that if players wants more control over how their actions are portrayed, they could always try to be as specific as they want when describing the action theyÂ´re about to take.
For example, "I attack the stormtrooper with my lightsaber", could yield many different results from the GM with regards to descriptions. "I charge in with my lightsaber swinging overhead, and going for the stormtrooperÂ´s neck", on the other hand, gives a pretty clear picture of what the player is trying to do.
These examples might be a bit extreme, but this is just my opinion, such as it is

I try to take this approach honestly. Maybe not 100% like you described. But if you review the "After Effects" battle scene which is now in the PBP Histories section, you should see some thing close to what your talking about.
I tried not to add to much in the way of extra description. Master Tru's character Jace slashed two handed at his opponent. He described how he did it, I reiterated his move and added description for what happened to the person he was fighting. Very close to how a table top game would run.
I'm not sure how player input isn't achieved in PBP, everyone in Tru's game has said what they have wanted there characters to do in there posts. Tru has rolled the dice and added in what the baddies do and opens the floor for the players to post there next action. That seems similar to a table top game to me.
I might be misunderstanding you a bit here. So If I went way off in left field feel free to pull me back. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I think the level of player control you want is impractical for play by post. In pbp game, you're extremely lucky if you even get a single combat round finished per day. Your process requires, at minimum, double the amount of posts as players and GM hash out what happens, stretching the time it takes to post that combat round. The other problem is that by the time the GM posts the round summary everyone already knows exactly what's happened, so it's not exciting to read any more. It might work for tabletop and chat games, but I feel that for pbp games it would be the bane of pacing and storytelling in the game, just for a little extra player control.

thanks for chiming in on that Rowen. that was exactly the scene I had in mind when i wrote my last comment. thatÂ´s about the level of player control I feel works best for PbP. if you need more than that for a specifc action, then perhaps note it OOC or in a PM to the GM. more then a few actions here and there would probably only serve to slow the game down though

Thanks DA! Most anything else would set the game to a crawl. It was the one thing when creating the site I had to think about. I found many guides to PbP games and all of them worked similar to what we have here.
Also, things are in a Beta if you will. Were feeling things out and suggestions on how to do things better are more than welcome. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
