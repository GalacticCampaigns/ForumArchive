# Into the Unknown - Setting Material

### **Alicia** (2010-12-17 13:12:25)

If you're in my ITU campaign I recommend you not proceeding further unless you want to ruin the surprise. With that said, the content in the links below will be introduced to my players at an appropriate time.
I've had this material in my head for almost two years and I'm just now getting to put it down. I'm looking for some input into what I have written already as I know at times what I have in my head doesn't always mesh with what should work.
This is a work in progress and I'll post when I've added content.
