# Critical Hits

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-01-20 15:39:28)

OK, this is not mainlt for the Saga RPG, but for another system that IÂ´m working on, set to be more medeival fantasy RPG. It is based a lot on the Saga system though.
What IÂ´m looking for is suggestions on how to make critical hits (or hits that exceeds the DT) more "interesting". Also, IÂ´d appreciate any suggestions for "aimed" attacks.
Some ideas that I have played with:
[ul]
Have Crits that passes the DT inflict a persistent condition that can only be removed by healing back to full Hp. This is easy to use, and could maybe be used in Saga as well. A little dull though.
Have a "critical hit chart". This adds another roll to the game, but can give a lot of interesting options. Here I had a lot of special things that could happen, persistent conditions representing hit to knees, arms, chests, etc. While adding another roll, this can become very interesting.

Consider Paizo Publishing's *Critical Hit Deck* for this purpose.

Thanks for that, that was a great thing. Now it just has to be adapted to the system.

Ok, hereÂ´s an example of what I came up with so far. If you score a critical hit that deals damage > your opponents DT, then you rolls a d20 and checks on the appropriate chart. There are modifiers to this roll, such as a characters innate luck, and certain weapon qualities.
**Slashing Damage**
1-5: No additional effect
6: Woodcutter â€“ You deal weapon damage to your opponents weapon if it is a wooden weapon.
7: Flat Side â€“ You deal an amount of stun damage equal to the amount of damage your hit made.
8: Minor Bleeding Wound â€“ You inflicts a small wound that does 1 bleeding damage to your opponent.
9: Wild Slash â€“ Your opponent suffers a -1 penalty to his Reflex Defense against the next attack made against him.
10: Leg Swipe â€“ Your opponent falls prone.
11: Severed Arm â€“ You strike a hit against your opponents arm that renders it useles and hanging limp at his side. The arms can only be healed by receiving long-term care (see Treat Injury) for at least 8 hours.
12: Moderate Bleeding Wound â€“ You inflicts a wound that causes one dice of your weapons base damage as bleeding damage to your opponent. 1d6 for a longsword for example.
13: Severed Leg â€“ You strike a hit against your opponents leg that causes him to loose much of his ability to use it properly. His speed will be cut in half until he has benefited from long-term care (see Treat Injury) for at least 8 hours. Should an opponent have both his legs severed, he falls prone and cannot get up.
14: Gut Strike â€“ You score a lethal hit against your opponents belly. He takes triple damage and also suffers a persistent condition that can only be removed via long-term care (see Treat Injury) for at least 8 hours.
15: Major Bleeding Wound â€“ You inflicts a severe wound that gives your weapons full base damage as bleeding da,age to your opponent. 6 for a longsword for example.
16: Throat Hit â€“ You scores a hit against your opponents throat. He immediately moves 2 additional steps down the Condition Track, and suffers 5 points of bleeding damage. He also becomes unable to take more than a swift action every round until healed.
17: Arm Cut â€“ With a vicious blow, you cut one of your opponents arms off. This causes him to take a -5 penalty to all Strength or Dexterity based skill- and ability checks.
18: Leg Cut â€“ With a vicious blow, you cut one of your opponents legs off. This causes him to take a -5 penalty to all Strength or Dexterity based skill- and ability checks. Also, his speed is cut in half. Should an opponent have both his legs cut off, he falls prone and cannot get up.
19: Skullcleaver â€“ With a powerful blow against your opponents head, you causes a terrible wound that causes him to take 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage. He also becomes dazed for 5 rounds, and falls 3 steps down the Condition Track.
20: Decapitation â€“ With a single mighty blow, you severs your opponents head from his body, killing him outright.
Decapitation can be avoided, much in the way you can use a Force Point to avoid death in Saga.
Please give your input.

Won't most critical hits (you deal x2 damage) exceed one's Damage Threshold? Or with your alter system, critical hits don't multiply the damage? If this is the case, I might sag this idea for myself (when attached to the below).
Honest, I would avoid like hell more charts. They slow down the game- which is a pet peeve of mine, so take it for what you will. I suggest a much simpler method of either picking (preferred) or rolling for a vague location, then assigning an extra penalty for that. Something equal to a persistent condition that replaces the first single movement down the DT the damage may cause.
For example, Lucy, our favorite head crushing Gamorrean bone crusher, smashes An'new the twi'lik dancer with a coffee maker. Lucy, who massively strong, Stunning Strike and Devastating Attack (coffee maker), scores a critical hit. A quick d10 roll reveals she hit the much pretty dancer in the head. An'new moves two steps down the condition track, with first one being persistent (the coffee maker dents her head, burns her, and blood runs into her eyes). When An'new could spend 3 swift actions to move up the Condition track 1 level, she cannot remove the burns and skull dent until she recovers fully.
SHe is also thinking calling a former Gamorrean Soldier 'fat' a bad idea.
Here is a chart like thing. Mostly, it's just to determine the hit location. Every entry grants a single persistent move down the condition track. THe stuff in italics are optional, on the basis they require the chart is the first place.
1 Head: Target is moved one level down on the Condition track (this is a persistent condition), *as well stunned until just before the attackers next action.*
2-6 Torso: Target is moved one level down on the Condition track (this is a persistent condition). That is all.
7-8 Manipulating limb(s): Target is moved one level down on the Condition track (this is a persistent condition)*, and that limb drops what ever it's holding.*
9-10 Movement Limb(s): Target is moved one level down on the Condition track (this is a persistent condition)**, and moves at half their normal speed for one turn.*
Really and truly, the Condition track is suppose to represent painful injuries, disabled limbs, and all of that, plus accent the heroic qualities of the character as they push passed the pain, and overcome their injuries. Might be good as is.*

Yeah, most crits will probably overcome the DT, but this keeps away the low-level mooks and in many cases martial artists from scoring these powerful hits. But you always takes x2 damage in addition to the effect listed.
I know a chart and an additional roll slows down gameplay, but I figured one more roll could be ok.
The more I think of it, this thing is probably not for Saga, but I still think it can add some flavor to a medeival fantasy game with most combat done in melee with swords, axes and maces.
