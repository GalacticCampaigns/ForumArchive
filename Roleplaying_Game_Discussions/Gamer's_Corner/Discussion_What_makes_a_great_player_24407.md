When you're looking for players or running a game what sort of standards to hold your players to? Whether it be posting quality, amount, etc.
What about character creation? How do you prefer your players stat out their sheets and develop their characters.
The goal of this discussion is to establish a baseline for a set of guidelines which we will encourage all GMs and players to hold to.
