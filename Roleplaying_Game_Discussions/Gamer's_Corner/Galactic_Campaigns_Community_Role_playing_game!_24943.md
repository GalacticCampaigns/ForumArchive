# Galactic Campaigns Community Role playing game!

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-12-08 21:57:39)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Poll was reset, you may need to vote again.</span> If you vote for wanting more information, please pose your questions so we know what it is specifically you would like to know.
Hello everyone! A few GM’s and I have been discussing an interesting concept for Galactic Campaigns. Basically, we’d like to integrate a persistent large scale role playing game within chat format. Think of it like an MMORPG. You make a character sheet and you join the chat hub. In this hub, you are free to role play with other PC’s as you wish. The hub would be available for free style role playing at anytime, and you’ll be using the one character you’ve created. Your character can be role played 24/7, around the clock. It’s like coming into the GC chat room but this time we are coming in to talk about our PC’s lives instead of our real ones. The setting and realm will be determined based on interest.
At any time during your RP adventures in the hub, a GM can come in and regulate things happening within the chat hub. Or, most likely, the GM will take you on a one shot session. Many GM’s will take your one character over a span of adventures that tie into a large overall story arc. The idea here is to to gather GC in a continuous role playing fashion and let us log on and role play whenever we want.
The next step is an interest check. This is for all players and GM’s wishing to get involved with this radical new project. So please vote if you would like to see the continuous role play campaign take off!

I voted No ... but it's a tentative no depending on how the game turns out ... I'd be interested in something more structured perhaps, but I've had my go at freeform in the past.

I don't think its going to be freeform from the discussions that I've had with Will. There are a slew of systems out there and even the system Simply had created. It would truly be like a chat based MMORPG where you would have stated abilities and gain XP.

But how would one character using, say, HEX interact with someone using Cortex?

---

### **Alicia** (2010-12-08 22:19:05)

We would have a specified setting which the community would agree on and with it a system. Right now we are seeing what interest is in a persistent world, next will come genre whether it be fantasy, steampunk, star wars, etc. After that we can agree on systems based on the genre with the most interest.
If interest grows then we could see about multiple persistent worlds but for now, let's not get too ahead of ourselves <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Sketchpad** (2010-12-08 22:25:51)

Then let me say that it's still no, but still tentative depending on what happens ...

### **simplyscribed** (2010-12-09 10:32:19)

Well hang on now, I don't see why multiple systems couldn't be used. Obviously we would have a single system as default, but if a GM wanted to run an adventure or even a campaign using a different system, and if he or she could find players willing to use a different system, then there's no real problem with them doing that.
The important thing, to my mind, is the shared setting and opportunity to frequently roleplay living, breathing characters in a growing, changing world. What system (if there be a system at all) and whether those characters can actually grow in terms of what's on their character sheet are completely secondary concerns for me.
Any benefits a character gains using one system should probably be limited to that system though, as levelling up and converting in combination would be a nightmare. The easiest solution would be for players interested in using a new system with the setting to create a new character for the purpose.
On that note, multiple characters per player should be feasible too. Whenever you run a character through an actual adventure they'd gain experience and the rest of your cast wouldn't, and that's really the only clarification necessary: there'd be no harm in jumping in and out of the freeform non-GMed sessions with several characters.

The Poll it seems got reset. Anyone who voted before will need to recast their vote.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-12-09 13:25:57)

Those sound like some good ideas simply. I see no problem in having multiple settings and multiple characters. However, I think we should start with just one setting for the trial run if we get this thing off the ground. We want everyone to be channeled into one RPG setting to foster and grow interest. Once the RPing is full-swing on the site and everyone is continuously logging in to play their characters, then another setting should be considered.
Free form would be ok as long as no PC deaths were involved while the GM's were away. But if for example they want to make up their own adventure when no one else is present, then that is fine.
Right now, as Alicia said, we need to get the interest generated for this RP concept. Then we can hash out the details as fast as needed once we know that everyone actually wants to participate. The details will be easy as long as we know people want to be involved in this project.
Once again, our primary goal here is to bring GC together and allow anyone to log onto the web site and begin role playing as soon as they enter the chat room.

just saying, but since the poll was reset it might be a good idea to announce that somewhere, as some of us don't randomly check non-lighty boards

### **Magical2099** (2010-12-09 20:00:50)

I voted yes, but my opinion on the system/setting bit: don't throw tons of options out there, the idea will die while trying to start out. Start with something the majority is familiar with (I know I'll get cussed for this one) Saga, and (go ahead and keep cussing) Star Wars to get it up and running and see how it goes. If it can't survive in a known system in a known setting it has no chance of surviving the multitude other options.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-12-09 20:08:16)

I agree with Magical completely. We can't get bogged down in the planning phase. It's better to get the core foundation for this game. Get it up and running, then iron out the details. The longer we draw it out; the quicker interest will dwindle.

### **Magical2099** (2010-12-11 08:35:57)

here's one I think would go over fairly well. Separatist Mercenaries. This has several advantages over, say clones: A: clones limit character creation options, mercenaries can be anyone or thing. B: Clones run in squads, so an ever changing cast would feel fake since clone squads rarely changed unless one died, mercenaries have different motivations and interests and lives away from the war, so one or the entire group changing from one adventure to the other wouldn't be out of the ordinary. C: mercenaries are individuals and unique, unlike clones, which offers more RP goodness and RP opportunity. D: How often do Separatist campaigns get run? Not evil Sith taking over the galaxy campaigns, but the Separatists themselves, who simply hold a different political belief, and the mercenaries they hire to supplement their droid armies. Course, don't think I'll be offended should you choose not to use this idea, now that I'm done typing it I'm tempted to C&P into an interest check and casting call for a PBP lol. Y'all get first dibs though cause I'd rather play it than run it, and my plate is full at the moment.

I think this idea would work rather well. It wouldn´t necessary have to be Separatist Mercs though, since mercs generally work for anyone that pays them. That way, GMs could just make sure their adventure includes a call for mercenaries, and you would be set to take on those who answers the call.

The voters that selected maybe need to post their questions, so we can address any concerns.

---

### **Dreamwalker** (2011-01-02 21:12:16)

Ok, I haven't heard from the maybe voters...have you guys heard from them? If we have idle maybe voters then perhaps we should count their vote as a no. I believe if someone is voting maybe with no description they are just stalling and not showing much interest. We can't launch this project with a lot of people on the fence....nor would I want to.

---

### **Alicia** (2011-01-03 09:15:30)

That's a rather pessimistic view, Will. Take them as unsure. They may come around as the project develops to put in their yes or no vote. Even if you do count them as no you still have just as many votes saying yes. 9 is a significant number of active members on this site. Please consider proceeding with the next step.

Gotta agree with Alicia here, DW. The maybes with no questions asked or concerns voiced are better treated as non-existent. They just shouldn't count. These are players, some of the most finicky folks on the planet (I got no problem saying that cause I can be guilty of it myself from time to time <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> ). Just view those maybe votes as exactly what they are, nothing.

### **myles1076** (2011-01-05 00:06:02)

Your post sounds more like you agree with DW that the votes shouldnt count, while Alicia says they should be counted as what they are unsure, personally i dont think there should even be a maybe option, either your interested in the concept or you are not, there isnt a maybe as there isn't enough information yet to make that kind of decision.

---

### **Magical2099** (2011-01-05 00:43:24)

Naw naw naw, DW wants to count them as 'no's, i say don't count em at all. If he counts em as 'no's that brings it to a tie, which is giving the maybe voters more pull than their indecisiveness is worth. I say ignore the maybes, and I agree that maybe shouldn't have been an option, its just asking for a lack of information. Hell, even though its an anonymous vote folks who ain't interested will vote maybe so as not to hurt feelings or go against the crowd.
I get the feeling DW is losing patience with the whole idea due to the maybe voters and their lack of questions. Happens to a lot of GMs, got an amazing idea, players (or potential players) don't show enough interest you loose steam, get discouraged. I've seen it kill many an amazing game.
DW, chin up and soldier on. My suggestion: can this vote BS and move ahead with what you and the other GMs have so far. Keep it simple and crank it up ASAP (say end of January), let it grow (or die) on its own, not based on the whim of players who haven't seen it in action or who don't really care anyway. Get the basic premise ironed out (who VS who), throw up a casting call, and go from there.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-01-05 10:06:34)

I just have to say I think all the people who´ve voted "Maybe, need to learn more" (myself included), wants just that. To learn more. So far, this isn´t very structurized, with a lot of things still hanging. Personally, I know there are systems I don´t like to play, possible playforms I may not like, and so on.
For example, I don´t want to put in a "Yes", to later see the game develop into an, intrigue-based game of speaking in a high-strung language set in reneissance France.

The campaigns will be a standard roleplaying experience like any other site. After this vote, we will pick the setting. I'm thinking Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, Vampire, Mutants and Masterminds, or Modern. Like I said, it will be an active roleplay game in which you can pick up and roleplay your character within a roleplaying chat room. At any time, a GM can come and recruit you for a one time adventure. The adventures span multiple GM's and you keep one character throughout the whole major campaign.
