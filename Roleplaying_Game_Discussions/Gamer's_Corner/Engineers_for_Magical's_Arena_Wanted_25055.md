# Engineers for Magical's Arena Wanted

### **Magical2099** (2011-06-29 04:50:10)

Okay, as the Arena grows I've decided to add a couple User Created Content threads for... well... user created content. Right now there are threads for maps, personalities, and mercs. Not just the players can post there, but also the rest of the community. I'm posting here to advertise this (if there's a better place for it, let me know).
If you have an old character sitting around gathering dust but don't actually want to play in the Arena, submit them and they may see use as hire-able muscle, opponents, or just some of the random personalities of Killee-Kor.
Good with maps? Have some that you just can't find a place to use? Submit them and the Gladiators of the Arena may test them out for you. NOTE: I've found this to be more difficult that originally estimated, so include text explaining things in detail please.
The forum is [here](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=204 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=204") and there is a discussion thread for... well... discussing submissions.
Thanks and I'll see you in the Arena!
