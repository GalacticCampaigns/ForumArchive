# Changing History

### **Anazider** (2008-03-04 22:51:32)

I saw this discussion on the WotC boards, and felt it an interesting enough topic to broach here.
How does everyone here feel about "rewriting history", ie. changing Canon based on the occurrences in your games? And I mean more than just the inclusion of your character in the greater workings of the Star Wars universe, I want to know how everyone feels on more fundamental and groundbreaking changes. Your characters somehow successfully assassinate Palpatine, or lands the lucky shot that forces Luke Skywalker to miss his run on the Death Star?
I've mixed feelings, as I love for my characters, and players as a GM, to have a genuine impact on the galaxy, not just a small or or completely original/unexplored sector of canon. But sometimes this can spiral out of control, and you end up with an "Infinities" campaign, or something completely alien to what we know as established Star Wars.

It's a no-go area for me. On the whole, I like Star Wars canon. My players can achieve great things, and they can interact with canonical aspects of the setting, but they can't interfere with previously defined events as they are meant to occur.

I, and another GM friend of mine, are against changing cannon. We also hate our heroes playing second string to the heroes of the movies. So our heroes will never "help" the movie heroes do the stuff in the movies, battle one of the Death Stars, or anything like that. The galaxy is huge, with thousands of separate adventures taking place, with the need for their own heroes. I feel there is no need to interfere with what 'already happened'.
(On a side note, I think playing in Forgotten Realms and constantly running into Drizzt, or Elminster, or any of the other well known epic heroes is just plain annoying)
But that's just how my friend and I run things. Go with what's fun for your group, and you.

Thats why I stopped running Forgotten Realms and Dragon Lance games, home brew for me <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I don't mind playing in "Infinities" games, but would never run one. When I do run Star Wars, my players usually take on the roles of people who are not affiliated with any of the main characters. So, people working for a different Rebel cell than Luke, Han etc. Or people who are placed on "Special Units" that are rarely in direct contact with thier superiors. They may see Darth Vader once in a long while to recieve some new orders, but otherwise they operate on thier own.
