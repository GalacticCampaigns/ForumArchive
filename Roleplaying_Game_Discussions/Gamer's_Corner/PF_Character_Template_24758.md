A section by section explanation:
Heroic Characteristics
This section has all your basic information for normal play.
Character Name - Your character's full name
CR - Character/Challange level; Sum of all heroic levels and 1/3 for non-heroic levels
Sex - Male, female, etc.
Race - Each race will have their own bonuses and penalties.
Level - Here you mark what classes and what level in that class you are. ie Noble 3 / Soldier 1 (It is recommended to put what your first level class was first.)
Alignment – Two letter abbreviation for your alignment. CG, LG, etc.
Size - Small, Medium, Large, Huge. Each size class has its own penalties and bonuses depending on size.
Type – What type of creature you are. Humanoid is the most common among PCs.
Subtype – Often your race, but can be other things as well. Consult the PFRPG for more info.
Init - Initiative modifier.
Senses - Here you would mark whether you have low-light vision or darkvision, then your Perception modifier.
Defensive Attributes
AC – Armor Class. List Touch AC and Flat-Footed as well. Please list all modifiers as well. Ie (+2 Dex, +3 Armor).
HP - Your total amount of Hit Points.
HD – Your total Hit Dice with modifer. Include number and type of die.
Saves – Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Per level bonus + stat.
Defensive Abilities – Various defensive abilities are listed here.
Attacks and other Combat Actions
Speed - The base speed of your character. Defined by your race, talents and/or armor.
The next section is where you would list out your attacks with ranged and melee weapons. The template has it "by weapon" because even if you don't have a weapon in your possession for melee or ranged it's still important to know what the modifier to attack will be.
If you have rapid strike, rapid shot, or any ability which differentiates your attacks in some way from the norm, it is recommended to list them out with the changes.
For example wrote:
Melee unarmed +5 (1d4+3) and
Melee Longsword +5 (1d6+3)
Ranged Light Crossbow +4 (2d6+2) with rapid shot
Special Attacks – Any special attacks per race or class.
Class Spells Known – List by class, number of spells and list. Include CL (Caster Level) and bonuses for touch attacks. So, for example: Wizard Spells Known – 0: Mend, 1: Magic Missile, Unseen Servent, etc.
Detailed Attributes
Abilities - Your ability scores for Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma are recorded here.
Base Attack – Base Attack per Class(es)
CMB – Combat Maneuver Bonus. What adds to any maneuvers attempted.
CMD – Combat Maneuver Defense. Works like AC against CMB.
Feats - All feats from your classes and character levels.
Skills - Trained skills and any skills which have been modified abnormally. ie if you are size small you have a +5 to Stealth. You would include Stealth here even if you aren't trained in it.
Languages - This is where all the languages you know are recorded. You know your racial languages + INT mod, though you will always have your racial languages even if you have a negative INT.
SQ - Special Qualities. Racial benefits or other abilities of note here which wouldn't fall under the category of Special Actions or Attack Options.
Combat Gear – List of equipment that you'd use in combat.
Normal Gear – Other things your character carries
In regards to gear, please remember encumbrance does count!
