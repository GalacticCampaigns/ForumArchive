# GM and Player Tips for a Successful Play by Post Game

### **Rowen** (2009-06-01 22:04:26)

Play-by-posts are great for GMs and players who don't have the time, or the ability, to run a face-to-face game. For those new to PbP it can seem daunting at first. I hope the tips below will help get anyone new to PbP a head start in the right direction.
The following articles were written by the GMs of this community who wished to give some words of wisdom to the new GMs and players wanting to broaden their horizon and enter the world of Play by Posts.
Members are welcome to submit their own articles. Please see below for details.
The articles are separated into sections:

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**The Dos and Don&#39;ts of Play by Post**</span>
**DO** come up with an interesting campaign name
**DON'T** expect potential players to know everything about the setting.
**DON'T** post a poll with an option for more information. Players are by nature lazy and have short attention spans. They also rarely believe they should be bothered with the hassle of putting their vague feelings into words to quantify why they aren't sure about something. Better yet, don't use polls at all, at least the not the 'yes, no, maybe' kind. Just write the interest check, do your very best to answer the obvious questions in the initial post, and then if the players are interested they'll ask questions on their own while posting concepts. With an option to vote for more information, they'll just vote and expect you to telepathically strip from their mind what they want to know.
**DO** lay a ground work of house rules early and try your damnedest to stick to it. Changing rules during play can be the biggest headache in the world, and it can lead some players to losing interest if it happens often.
**DON'T** make a casting call or join a game if you've got too many irons in the fire or aren't serious about running or playing.

If you are the GM and you get good responses to it and then back out, players begin to distrust you as a GM, and won't apply as quickly next time. If you start one anyway, give it the majority of your attention because it's your baby. If you let your own game slide for other games you do your players a disservice, and can count on them not being interested in any other game you decide to run. GMing can be incredibly difficult, and that players can be some of the most selfish, lazy human beings you've ever met, but as GM you have to hold yourself to a higher standard. Without you, the game fails automatically.
**DO** remember you get the most out of the game as you put into it. When you put in the effort to post regularly and take your time on each post, you may be surprised by the sort of responses from fellow players and GMs.

## Planning the Game

### **Alicia** (2010-01-08 17:50:24)

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Think Small to Think Big**</span> by Simplyscribed
So you ran a game for your mates, one night a week for a year. You told an epic story that spanned the breadth of the galaxy and three generations of heroes. Your players said it was the best game they'd ever been in. And you want to run it on the forum.
Don't. The first thing to realise about this medium is that it's slow and will require a lot of patience. The adventure that your mates took 5 hours to complete will span months of posting. A year's worth of adventures, realistically, will never come to pass.
This doesn't mean that an online campaign cannot last for an exceptionally long time and tell an epic tale, but the blunt truth of it is that this is rare. And if your vision is too large the reality will frustrate you.
A good approach is to plan things on a smaller scale. Write a short "season", with perhaps 6 "episodes"/adventures. The story arc for this should be self-contained. A smaller setup like this is much easier to bring to a successful close, giving your players and yourself something many online roleplayers never manage: closure. At the end of the season, if your players and yourself are still interested in the game's premise you can simply write another season! The plot will remain as simple and self-contained as the last, but you will have a wealth of NPCs and ideas to draw from which will make the second season feel even richer for an equal (or lesser) amount of effort.

## Starting the Game

### **Alicia** (2010-12-22 11:13:38)

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Steps to establishing a play by post**</span> by Alicia

1. **Post an Interest check and/or a Casting Call**
After you know what kind of game you want to run, you can either post an interest check to first see if there are indeed any interested players out there. or If you feel confident you will get submissions skip to posting a Casting Call in the appropriate section. A Casting Call will be required for all games and there must be some indication of progress towards a ready cast before a forum request can be made.2. **Request a forum in the [Campaign Forum Requests](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=151 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=151") forum**
When you have the cast you want, you may then request a forum be opened for your game. This is done in the [Campaign Forum Requests](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=151 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=151") forum. Follow the instructions in the sticky and an Administrator or Global Moderator will get your forum up.3. **Set up needed threads**

*[*]OOC Discussions  
[*]Cast List  
[*]Game thread*
After the forum up, it's a good idea to set up two threads to start. One will be for your players to post their final character sheets, which they will update during the course of the campaign. The second is an OOC Discussion forum. You will of course need to make one more thread, one for the game itself.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Casting the Game**</span> by simplyscribed
When you've decided what you want to run and you've planned enough of the game that you're ready to get started, you need to move onto the next and most important step: finding players!
On Galactic Campaigns we achieve this by posting a Casting Call in the relevant section (post in the Star Wars Play-by-Post section for a Star Wars game, the Virtual Tabletop Homefront for an OpenRPG game, and so on).
Take note of the following points when creating your casting call:
1. Write a topic title that grabs attention. It should include the game's title (which itself should be as punchy as possible) and include other information that will help players decide if it interests them. For example, a Star Wars casting call should include the Era of play (eg. "[RotE] Into the Unknown", where RotE indicates Rise of the Empire). A game in the General section should include the system you intend to use in the title (eg. "M&M3e: Heroes, Inc.").
2. Get to the point quickly. Potential players should know why they're meant to be excited about your game early in the casting call. Either a short description of the campaign concept or a "in-setting" paragraph of prose demonstrating the concept are both appropriate ways to achieve this.
3. Tell us more. Okay, we got through the first paragraph and we're still interested. Now is the time to give us all the information you think will be useful to us in deciding who and what we want to play and how our characters will be linked with the world. Any kind of setting information is appropriate here: a bit about geography, history, culture, religions, significant orders/guilds, unique combat/magic styles, and similar details might be included. Remember that you should be as succinct as possible - if players need more information they can always ask, so just tell us as much as you can in summary form to pique our interest.
To illustrate points 2 and 3, here is the information I included in my casting call for Drakensban: End Times. It provides a short summary of the setting and then lists a few aspects of the setting that a player may be interested in exploring.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

The campaign setting
The cultures of the continent of Drakensban have developed isolated from the world, trapped between the deadly Wastes to the North and a magical barrier across the sea to the South - a barrier left by a master race who abandoned their servitors ages past. The continent was once the home of the Draken, monstrous flying beasts which ravaged civilisations, until they were banished as part of the same magical ritual that trapped Drakensban's people.
Drakensban is on the face of it a high magic setting with dark and deadly undertones. Following is a short list of some of the fantasy staples the setting offers:
**Magic:** When the Gesp travelled South, leaving their loyal servants behind, they left a miraculous gift. Those individuals gifted with a Lesser or Greater Spark may learn and practice the art of magic. Drakensban boasts traditional mages alongside graphomancers who prepare disposable spell triggers in advance. The Church has servitors known as Blessed, who differ from mages only in the way they ritualise their magic and the manner in which they Sparked. Haemomancy, or Blood Magic, is practiced by unsavoury cults and sadistic mages. Even martial artists and the legendary Waste Rangers practice a form of magic, taking advantage of their inner Spark (often unknowingly) to access inhuman abilities.
**Adventure:** To the North lie the Wastes and further even than they the Ice Wastes. Surrounding are mountains and underneath are countless unknown underground lairs. The brave, the foolhardy, and those with a death wish have no shortage of places to explore and find adventure. Great treasures and historical secrets may lie in ruins that predate even the first landing of the settlers.
**Intrigue:** There are seven nations on the continent of Drakensban, each with its own political agenda. In the courts of each nation the Elite vie for supremacy. The State withholds power from the Church, and the Church undermines the State. Powerful Mages and great warriors work for the benefit of their preferred benefactors or pursue their own goals, often acting above the laws of the lands.
**Mystery:** What is the truth behind the Gesps' abandonment of Drakensban? Where did the Draken come from and how were they banished? Why is the Waste full of monsters, and who built the ancient ruins within it? Is there truly no way to leave Drakensban? These questions and more await the would-be citizen, and may or may not be answered during the course of the campaign.

4. Tell us what you want from the characters. We're hooked now, so you just need to tell us how we qualify for a place in this wonderful game of yours. This is the part where you explain how many players you need, any ground rules with regard to what kind of characters you want (level, class, starting abilities, etc.) and what character options you're excluding, any homebrew material you're making available for player use, and so on. If you want us to write at least 3 paragraphs of background for the character, say so. If you're happy with a single paragraph concept for now which can be expanded later, say so. I would advise referring to the Rowen's guide, "Lay out the Rules Early" as a simple example of what information you might want to provide. You can also browse existing casting calls.
5. Tell us how you're picking characters. Is it first come first served? Or are you setting a deadline for submissions after which you'll pick your favourites? In either case, it is important that you've been as clear as possible about what you want from submissions (see point 3) to avoid potential disappointment on either your part or the applicants.
6. Tell us what you expect from us. Explain what you'll be wanting from us as players - quality of posts, regularity of posts, level of maturity, and so forth.
7. Provide any other information you think is relevant. For example, if the game is going to involve mature themes then you should make a note of that.*
8. When writing your casting call, remember to arrange it in a way that provides the information in a way that is easy to read and reference. Make use of bbcode to help you: for example you can use larger text to create headings, horizontal lines to separate sections, bold or italicised text to emphasise particularly important points, and bullet points or numbers to clarify lists.
9. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. If you're unsure at any point what to include in your casting call feel free to refer to existing calls posted by other members.
**This is also something you need to consider when requesting a forum for the game - if you think it will be inappropriate for general viewing you can request a private forum.*

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Lay out the rules early**</span> by Rowen
Before you start the actual game make sure you lay out all your rules (official or house rules) early and logically so the players know what to expect. Let them know exactly how to create characters, what house rules you're using, and how often they will be expected to participate.
Here's an example of what I laid out for a SW PbP.

**Character Creation**
All characters start at 1st level
32 point buy for stats
Starting credits = Max for class
Books to use = Saga core rules, and KoTOR
Races = Anything except Ewoks!
Classes = Whatever's in the above books
Equipment = anything in the above books, as your starting credits permit.
If you want something that goes against these rules, ask.
**Detailed background required**
**Rules of Play**
At minimum, please post twice a week. More if you have the time.
There will be a separate thread for OOC comments. If you must make OOC comments in game, make sure you designate them as such with (( )) and the text in italics.
Die rolling is done by the GM.
I will not give out XP until the end of the adventure, or at a time when I think its necessary for your characters to advance if they have enough EXP.

**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Concepts &amp; You</span>** by Sketchpad
Before anyone can build a character, and after a player has the rules, the next step in building a better character is to work on concept. In the years I've been running RPGs, I've seen all manner of concepts cross my GM Screen; from the short *"I wanna play that guy that does that thing with those people"* to the near novella sized idea that should be made into an epic movie in the next four years. But what is a concept really?
Every Gamemaster has a different idea on what they require from players, but the following is some general rules that players should consider before submitting a concept:

* **Be Concise In Your Concept:** No one needs a doctorate-level thesis on what your character is meant to be, but also don't be a two sentence wonder. Take the time to think about what you want from your character and how they might be able to work within the group structure.
* **Discussion Is The Key:** Keeping your ideas to yourself helps no one, especially yourself. Discuss your ideas with the GM and some of the players to help round out the character and fit them into the campaign. Most campaigns should stretch a bit to work with player ideas, but most players should be mindful to the campaign world. If your story is that good, then the GM will find a way to work with you on it.
* **Be An Adult:** This isn't a kiddie site and, as such, you should remain in-check with your maturity. Be respectful of everyone in the game and, especially, your GM. If a ruling is something you don't find desirable, speak to the group and GM in the OOC thread, or speak to the GM via Chat/IM. Respect that they'll do what's right for the game and, in turn, respect their decision. It's one thing to make a point and another to argue it.
* **Be Ready With Backups:** If you really want to get into a game, be ready to toss a few ideas at the GM. It shows them that you're interested, have taken the time to work on ideas and that you aren't afraid of altering things if need be.
* **Be Liquid Rather Than Solid:** Concepts change quite a bit while the campaign is starting … be part of that change rather than the wall that blocks it. Working with the GM and players makes a better gaming experience for everyone.
* **Ask Questions:** Don't be afraid of asking questions when working on your character. Gamemasters are there to answer questions as well as run games. If you don't ask, no one will help.
* **Player On Player Action:** Some of the best concepts that I've ever seen involved players working together to link concepts. This shows not only interest, but general camaraderie which is a good building block for teamwork. Mind you, there can be limits to linking one another so please talk to your GM first.

So what should a concept look like? For my games, I will generally ask for about a decent paragraph or two explaining the general idea of your character. This should include a brief snippet of history, who they are and what they have for abilities/skills. It also doesn't hurt to include a small paragraph describing why you want to play in the game, as that tends to help the GM gauge interests levels. In the end, working with the GM and other players creates a group environment, allowing for strong ties and group fun, because that's why we play.
Here's a sample concept questionnaire for players:

**Name**

## Running the Game

### **Alicia** (2010-12-22 11:14:40)

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Be ready to play people&#39;s characters**</span> by Rowen
Some players may go on vacation but would still like to participate, all they need to do is request the GM to NPC them. Be willing to do that. If they're showing interest in your game, it's important that you keep them in the game because they're obviously having fun.

---

**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Formatting Suggestions</span>** by Alicia
Every player and GM have a different style when it comes to how they format their posts in relation to the options BBCode has to offer. The following can be used as a key and to offer suggestions on how to clarify aspects of a post from In character (IC) content to out of character (OOC) comments.
Whichever format you use, please attempt to be consistent for the benefit of your fellow members.
**Post Models**
For the convenience of members, pre-formatted post templates have been created and are available for posts and PMs. The model is chosen via a drop down box located under the subject text box and then you click "insert". The model is inserted automatically wherever your cursor was last in the post text box. There is an array of models already created for use from Star Wars Sage Character and Vehicle Stat block templates to a Pathfinder template. Each model will have a guide created for them which will explain the layout. The guides can be found in the appropriate RPG Discussion forum.
Anyone is free to submit a model, and only needs to create a guide in the proper format for a template to be eligible.
Additionally, for the benefit of players, a model for dice rolling has been included. For more information please see this thread <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> [Feature - Dice Rolls](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24538 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24538")
**OOC Comments**
It is inevitable that OOC comments will have to be made in a post. These comments should be restricted to being relevant to any action which has occurred from a clarification to the GM on what your character is doing to the modifiers and/or roll. To keep a flow of a post, they should come at the end.
Most posters will put them in (( )) or in *italics in a different color**. The option to place OOC in Spoiler box is another great alternative as the text will be hidden completely, the dice code will work within the spoiler.
**A Character's Voice**
To place a distinction on what is said or thought, and what is described posters find it beneficial to have dialogue text place in bold and even in a different color. Dialogue in another language can be placed in a different color* to show the differences in the character's normal speech pattern. Additionally, a poster can have fun making up a language or make use of a translator and place the translation in a spoiler box at the bottom of the post as OOC.
Thoughts can be placed in italics, separating them further from spoken text and descriptors and some will even place it in bold like their dialogue or put it in a color*.
**<span style="font-size: 1.15em;">*</span>** Please keep in mind if you use different colors that we offer a variety of themes for members to use on this forum. The text should be legible on a tan, black, and white background. Check out this topic to see the font colors in the themes: <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?t=25084](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=25084 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=25084")<!-- l -->

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Create a thread for OOC discussions**</span> by Rowen
Make a separate thread from the game to have discussions on what's happening in the game, rules, or anything else that needs to be discussed â€œaway from the table

---

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Description description description.**</span> by Magical2099
Lay things out as concretely, clearly, and concisely as you are able.
**Reason 1:** Far too many times a player is left in the dark as to what's going on where and at what time. When you describe everything in as much detail as you can it gives the players clear boundaries and clearer options.
**Reason 2:** It also helps with player post quality. Many players can find themselves lacking in creativity for their posts due to a lack of things to react to. As GM, you set the standard for the post quality. If your posts are lacking then a good player will either not want to contribute because you aren't or will try to fill in the blanks as creatively as possible (fun, but can backfire quickly because you forgot to mention something or describe it fully, leading to retconning and editing). If the GM's post are incredibly detailed it fosters the 'group effort' feeling and helps players put forth their very best to improve the game.
**Reason 3:** It just makes the story better. Obvious I know, but all the same.
**Examples and Ways to Make it Happen:** Never trust player assumptions. Anyone can interpret a blandly described scene improperly, so don't expect them to see it your way. Describe as much as possible. If the PCs walk into a public place mention the crowds, the peacekeepers, the merchants, what the ground is composed of, what the structures are made of, what kind of clothing is worn, what style of weaponry is most prevalent, etc., etc.. You never know when the detail may become relevant, and assuming a player won't make it relevant is a horrid mistake. You don't have to go into great depth, just a few words to half a sentence each can save you all the headache and game death in the world. It doesn't take a good writer or even an average one to do it, it's simply listing all the resources. You can be as plain and bare-bones as you like or as sesquipedalian as you like.
Some things merit a game mechanics description. Just add to the OOC portion of the post a brief breakdown of what role a significant part of the backdrop can play in a combat encounter. Player creativity can be allowed more leeway here, but if they don't know that fountain can provide cover if a PC is adjacent then they may not take advantage of it. Personally, I prefer as much transparency in game as possible. I explain hazards in detail when first encountered, as well as skill challenges and the like. Giving a PC a clearly defined goal helps them and you.

## Maintaining the Game

### **Alicia** (2010-12-22 11:16:43)

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Be flexible**</span> by Rowen
PbP has its differences from real life games. You may need to be a bit more flexible in your rulings so that you don't get bogged down in the details that, at the table, would take a few second. However, in a PbP could drag on for days as people post back and forth.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Communicate**</span> by Rowen
PbPs can last a while. Make sure that every few months you ask your players how they like the game so far. What needs to be changed, what working, etc. Feedback is important.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Be patient**</span> by Rowen
Not everyone will have the same posting schedule. Some will be able to post multiple times per day while others may only be able to post a couple of times. This is normal and as long as they are actually posting, you shouldnâ€™t get discouraged.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Be ready for players to drop out**</span> by Rowen
The longer your PbP lasts, the more likely it will be that players drop out for personal reasons. Be ready for this and have a â€œwaiting listâ€ of players that you can plug in quickly so as not to stop the flow of the game.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Have fun**</span> by Rowen
Just like real life gaming, PbPs are meant for everyone to have fun. If you're not having fun with the PbP, then either adjust your style or simply stop altogether. People would rather not play than to play with an unhappy DM.
