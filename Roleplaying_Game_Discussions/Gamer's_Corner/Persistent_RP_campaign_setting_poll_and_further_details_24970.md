# Persistent RP campaign setting poll and further details

### **Dreamwalker** (2011-01-20 20:05:15)

Ok, now that the interest has been expressed in the persistent role play campaign it's time to vote and explain how the game will actually play. I will break this down into steps to make this easy for everyone. I will use Star Wars as the setting as an example on how the game will actually work.
**Step 1: Character Creation**  No different than any other character creation process except that you may have only one character throughout your whole adventure. (Possibly more characters at discretion of Mods or GMs). Ok, so we'll say we'll create a Level 1 Jedi for our persistent roleplay experience, her name will be Mae-Lin Ison. The setting for the persistent campaign will be only one setting, and we recruit for one shot adventurers from a role playing room or hub. Let's log in Mae-Lin and begin the fun!
**Step 2: Role play!** The setting is the Clone Wars, and Mae-Lin Ison has her quarters in the Jedi Temple of Coruscant. As a player, we'll log Mae-Lin into ORPG or the GC chat room, depending on what we decide will be the main role playing lobby. The title of the chat room is the Jedi Temple, symbolizing that our character is walking into that setting realistically. As a player, you see there are 4 other people chatting in this room. It's like any other chat room, except you're chatting as a Jedi or a Clone Trooper. Yes, that's right...you role play as if you were going about your daily life as a Jedi Knight or a soldier in the Republic!
There is no OOC allowed in the room except in parentheses. And you get the opportunity to engage in conversation as if you were in your characters boots. You may even initiate combat if you dislike another player (if a GM is present to resolve the fight or if both players can end the dispute on their own with common sense). So now Mae-Lin Ison has taken considerable time talking to other Jedi, talking about her travels in the Clone Wars and her aspirations as a Jedi to gain further enlightenment, when suddenly the Padawans begin hearing whispers that they are being called to the front lines of Mygeeto!
**Step 3: Adventure and gain XP**: A GM is present within the Temple lobby, regulating the room and giving characters to do, when suddenly the GM decides to take everyone within the room on an adventure. All the PC's may drop what they are doing in the lobby and follow the GM on a one episode adventure. This would play out like any other campaign, except it's tied into one large grand campaign, that multiple GM's have control over. So if you earn XP from GM Obi Wan Kenobi, that stays on your sheet through each session as you level up across multiple GM sessions. This allows you to become more attached to your character as they have been through varied situations and you may form solid bonds with the other PC's you have seen in the Jedi Temple lobby. Moderators and GMs would strictly enforce the earnings of XP and loot throughout the adventures.
**Step 4: Continue to role play!** Now that Mae Lion has returned from her mission at Mygeeto and has down time at the Jedi Temple, she notices more PC's have joined the campaign as Jedi Initiates. It may be her responsibility to instruct the new players on how to play and how to be a better Jedi within the parameters of the story line. Mae Lin now has more character development and the younglings stand in awe at her tales of battle and negotiation. The persistent campaign begins turning its wheels and plays much like an MMO. Mae Lin is even given another PC as a Padawan after many travels in the Clone Wars.
That's a run down of how this campaign works, one character sheet, multiple adventures and GMs. You can always log in and role play at any time! As more players participate the Role play should grow in activity, giving you a role play outlet whenever the mood strikes you! Is there any more questions? Be advised, there's only so much I can tell you about the game. I'd like to arrange a beta play test of the game sometime. But please, I can encourage any questions for any thing I might have not covered. If not...let's vote on the setting!

I voted for Star Wars, but but because that's something everyone is familiar with and that is the site's bread and butter. A system like White Wolf's would be better for a chat rp because of it's simplicity, but I ain't interested in Vampire. Maybe Mage or Werewolf or even Promethean. DnD is interesting to me too, 4e anyway.

Okay, now keeping in mind I've never actually played a MMORPG, this sounds like a reasonable facsimile without the monthly fee. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
I voted SW as well, and I think I'd like to at least give it a try. I don't know how often I'd be on, but maybe you could announce when some main adventures are going to occur (obviously spur of the moment ones could just happen whenever)? I've used the chat enough to know how the dice-rolling works in it, but could the GM ever have help from us? If I can't, for instance, invest a ton of time into my own PC but I still like the idea, maybe I could log on and play as some Battle Droids for an adventure or something. All that to say that I'm willing to give it a shot.

Looks like we have a large assortment of folks interested in a Star Wars persistent world. Please stand by for the next step!

Maybe this isn't possible to change, but to keep with the theme I wonder if instead of the chat status for **BRB** and **At Work** or whatever, if it could say **Meditating** or **Resting** or something? Just a thought.
