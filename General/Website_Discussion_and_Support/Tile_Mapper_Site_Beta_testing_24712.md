# Tile Mapper Site Beta testing

### **Alicia** (2010-06-20 19:57:11)

I found a neat tile mapper off the WOTC site, check it out.
Still trying to get the site based mapper to work, but the downloadable version works fine.
If anyone has any knowledge in JavaScript and wants to take a jab as to why its not working let me know.

I eventually want to make it so GMs can use this to make maps for their campaigns and include tokens for NPCs and players. Whether this will be via saving an image or just sharing the map import code will be determined.

The Launcher is finally working. Use the link in the first post to visit it. If you wish to use this for your campaigns you currently have to use the print view and make a screen shot.
**Features to come:**
Alpha (upper and lower case) and numerical tokens in black, red, green and blue (accessible by rotating the image).
Image export to .jpg
More tiles
Looking for help to support this project.

Got a question or two on the mapper. Once I've added multiple tiles to a map and begin layering them and placing smaller tiles on top of larger tiles will randomly freeze up, can't be moved or sent to back/brought to front. Only thing that can be done with em is deleting em. Any way around this or fix for it? It works great until I start adding detail. I'm on the latest version of Opera with updated Java if it makes any difference. Thanks in advance!

I've been having this issue too and not sure what the problem is.

Hangs in the DLed version too. But the DLed version is still easier on my aircard <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
