# User Avatars

It might be noticed during the maintenance many avatars were lost. This is due to a change in the forum software behind the scenes which has prevented the forum from finding it correctly. Having been able to save most of them, users can find their old avatars in the gallery under "**User Uploaded**".
Also, due to a future upgrade for the chat room I have disabled the feature to upload your own avatar to the site.

Who would be interested in having the Gravatar system available here on the site for their avatar?
[Gravatars](http://en.gravatar.com/ "http://en.gravatar.com/") are essentially universal avatars which are saved via their site based on your email address. When you change your gravatar your avatar is changed on all sites where it is supported at the same time.

Me (although I think I'm one of the only people in the world that uses it <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> )....I haven't bothered using my avatar I don't think due to the site constraints (as in I couldn't be bothered to convert it to 100x100px or less than 100kb or whatever the criteria are.

Gravatars *instead* of what's currently available, or *in addition to* what's already available? I think I have one in Cyberspace leftover from Crowdtap actually. I thought the concept was awkward at the time but I guess I'm fine with whatever.

I'd have to see what the integration is, but I would hope it would be in addition.
