# Wikia

### **Alicia** (2009-10-05 10:42:50)

I've been mulling over this idea for a day or so, so I thought I would present it to the community.
What uses could you see in applying a wikia to the site?
I could see it being used to store campaign information. For example: character bios and sheets, setting information, NPC bios, ship information and sheets.
I think it would be a good idea to lay out all approved content for the Kalium galaxy in it as well.
I've been looking for wikia software which could be integrated with phpbb3 and this is what I've found.
[DokuWikia](http://www.dokuwiki.org "http://www.dokuwiki.org") - You could sign in once from either the wiki or the forum
[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki "http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki") - Same software used for Wikipedia. It would require you to log into the wiki with your forum information. (though as there's a lot of support for this it may be modified.)
[WikkaWiki](http://wikkawiki.org/ "http://wikkawiki.org/")
[PmWiki](http://wikkawiki.org/ "http://wikkawiki.org/")
I haven't tested the backend of these yet as I first wanted to get a first impression from the community.

I think having a wiki could be interesting. Like you said, putting up character info (and continuously updating of course) and other info from campaigns could be nice. Apart from pure info of PCs, NPCs, ships, etc you could also share houserules, new equipment, new feats and so on that you have used in your campaigns. Of course there should be someone set to be in charge of checking over the material, and if necessary standardize formats. Didn´t we have something similar on some iteration of this site?
And yes, it would give a very good place to structure the Kalium project in.

I think its a great idea, it was something I had wanted to do but opt for the Joomla format since it seemed easier lol (Thats the one your remember Alicia). As for which one, I would say go for which ever is more flexable. Sounds like that would be MediaWiki.

Is there a GM out there who would like to test this out initially for his campaign?
I have MediaWiki set up here <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> [http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/](http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/ "http://galacticcampaigns.com/wiki/")

I´ve been thinking of launching a new campaign soon, and I could give it a try. However, I think that we should try to establish some standard formats before starting to use it, and probably also someone (or some few) that views and edits as appropriate stuff before entered into the wiki.

Would it be permissible to put up a page summarising all the additional Dark Side mechanics in the books after SWSE itself?
This would be easier to access than going between all the books for a certain mechanic...

I believe I have it set up for people to add pages in general. I'll have to double check.
If you are volunteering to do the write up I would be more than happy to put it up.

Ah, really?
I couldn't find any function to add pages or anything there. In any case it says to contact a moderator regarding the wikia. I've written it up - looking at it, it was just TFU and JATM that has the extra DS rules. Shall I PM to you?

### **Alicia** (2009-12-18 13:57:11)

Yes, you can PM me the doc file. That would work best so I can see any formatting you were thinking. I'll make a namespace that people can add such rule compilations to in the future.

I believe I now have that section set up for people to add/edit to.
