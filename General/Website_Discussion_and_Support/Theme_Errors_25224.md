# Theme Errors

I noticed a few things went missing after the last update. The last one is only cosmetic, but the first two are quite convenient features. I did a check and they seem to be only missing from the Jedi Knights theme.
**Browser:** Firefox
**Board Style:** Jedi Knights
**Problem:** Missing indicators for new posts in a forum, sticky, announcement, etc
**Steps to replicate problem:** Switch to Jedi Knights theme

The first two issues have been fixed.
The Ranks I'll do when I figure out how I did it the first time. It was a custom bit of code I did in the main files not the styles.

Thanks
I personally can stand not having my cool title of Inquisitor for a while, but the other two are very useful functions for keeping track of whats happening around here.
