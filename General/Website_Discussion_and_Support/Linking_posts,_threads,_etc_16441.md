# Linking posts, threads, etc

I'd like to put a link in my sig to my post for any active character I'm portraying in a game here. This is, of course, much better than copying the sheet since if you're in more than 1 game it would confuse rather than assist things and may be too much for a the sig to hold (I understand there's a limit).
I'm sure this is very easy, as I've seen it done in other forums, I'm just not familiar enough with this forum to find it thus far.
Thanks in advance for any assistance.

Ok so posting a link to a thread is fine but I still can't put a link to a specific post. A workaround is, of course, creating a thread just to house a character sheet. I'm thinking I'll do that but I was hoping I could link to an individual post. Is that possible in this board?

THere is a way to link to specific post. When looking at the post near the date is a small icon. Right clicking on this and copying the link location will get you the link to the specific post.

The pic of the paper with the folded corner then says by and the name of the poster. Got it. Thanks so much. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
