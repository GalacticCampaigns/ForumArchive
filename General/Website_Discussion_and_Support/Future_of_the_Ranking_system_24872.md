# Future of the Ranking system

### **Alicia** (2010-11-05 11:27:26)

The other moderators and myself have been discussing this quandary the last week or so over an incident which happened in our chat room. In short we learned that there may be some out there who put too much stock in the value of the post counts. It is the opinion of myself and fellow moderators, having discussed it thus far only with them, that post counts should not matter to a community which should be holding post QUALITY, over post QUANTITY. The ranks were always meant to be a fun little quirk to the boards, but never something to be obsessed over.
While there is no way to pick and choose which posts will count and which ones don't we have come up with the following:

Remove post specific ranks completely.
Keep only two ranks. One for "Lurkers" those with 0 posts, and another for "Adventurers", those who have made at least 1 post.
Additionally, if the vast majority would still like to keep the system, we may still do so, but it will be getting a title revamp (the current Star Wars titles will be replaced with more system generic titles.)
This discussion does not include the special ranks: Moderators, Administrators, Global Mods, Donators, and Game Masters. In the future we could even discuss the possibility of other special ranks to promote and recognize members within our community.
A list of the current ranking system can be found in the [FAQ](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php").

I like the second option. Lurkers are treated differently anyway (they can only see part of the boards) so it makes sense to give them a separate title.
As for removing the post-based rank system, I wholeheartedly support this. I would rather it be replaced entirely by a system where getting properly involved around the site was rewarded with titles for recognition, rather than keeping the previous system where your involvement doesn't matter, nor the quality and impact of your posts, but only the quantity (extreme example, but it illustrates the point: theoretically, posting constant two-or-three word posts in a single thread would eventually get you to rank 20 and the highest title. That doesn't make much sense, does it?)

### **Magical2099** (2010-11-05 14:42:31)

I don't see anything wrong with the system as is, and am curious who in there right mind would put stock in it. To me it shows whose been around long enough to know there rear end from a hole in the ground. Points out people that can be asked for advice and so on. As for removing it, I don't see any problem there other than the word "quality." Different people have different opinions as to what makes quality. You may end up with an old-time supporter of the site having his feelings hurt because his not real good but plentiful posting suddenly doesn't help him stand out. It makes whatever contribution they have made (however 'lacking' it may be to some people) completely meaningless. I'm mostly just playing devil's advocate here cause I use one of the current 'special' ranks anyway, but I think my point is valid.
One thing that could be borrowed from another Forum I frequent is specific titles. These are one-off things, chosen by mods and higher, generally one-liners of comedic gold that come from somewhere on the forum. The site is Majorgeeks.com, and the titles can't be requested, it's completely up to the mods who gets what when. Most of them are good natured ribbing, at least that's how they got started, but now having one is a point of pride. They are damned hard to get.

For clarification (speaking on behalf of myself and, if I may, Alicia) "quality" was not meant to imply how well written a post is. Rather, it was meant to be an indicator of what the value of the post is to the site.
Posting to your games, while obviously valuable in the sense that you are helping the site remain active, is not the only activity a community member can take part in. And indeed, restricting yourself to just posting in games is excluding yourself from the community, which is not what the moderators consider desirable.
Posting A LOT to your games, meanwhile, is not necessarily more valuable to the community as a whole than posting a little. As long as the game remains active, the players remain on the forum, and the rest of us occasionally get something to read, the speed of the game is not so significant. Very active games *ARE* good, don't get me wrong, and they should be recognised, but they should be recognised as part of a larger contributions-based scheme that takes into account more than just the amount of posts being churned out.
If we move to a model where only special Titles are kept, then the titles actually stand for something truly meaningful and represent a quantified contribution to the larger community that everyone can see and appreciate. Let's say the moderating staff decide there should be a title for everyone who helps see the new Itara Cluster project through to its completion - there is absolutely no question that this project benefits the community (it keeps posters active, generates worlds and statblocks and ideas that anyone on the site can use, and possibly attracts more users, etc.) and there is absolutely no question that the Title granted as an award for that is well deserved. There could also be a title for outstanding games, where judges take into account both quantity and quality of posts, as well as the style, plot, how good a read it is for non-players...
Members that post more do still get rewards for posting more in this model, it just means that the posts aren't taken simply added up as a lump number - instead the posts you make to various sections of the site, the feedback you give, the discussions you generate, are accounted for separately and seen for their real value. As a desired effect of this, maybe it will encourage the entire community at least a little to step up their efforts in **both *quality* and *quantity***.
Basically, we'd be giving out Medals/Achievements. But no gamer points. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

### **Alicia** (2010-11-05 21:38:57)

That was a good explanation of my thoughts behind quality posts.
I'm curious as to who voted "other" for the poll as I did request an explanation. If this person would like to PM me in private, he/she may do so and I can share the ideas to the public.

### **zerah** (2010-11-05 23:51:51)

I honestly don't think ANYONE has ever said they value the quantity of posts over the quality of posts. and I mean. NO ONE. The titles are fun, and Rowen put them into play and made them fun. I don't think you should touch them at all let alone remove them completely, I find that rather...rude and a want to express ones own intentions and feelings instead of keeping things as they have always been and if one must by any means revamp what is already good and fine, then do so by adding more fun titles.
Get rid of the star wars names? are you serious? there may be other games here, but this is a star wars forum, and to mess with those of all things is just..stupid. I'm sorry, it is, and I'm doing my best to be polite here.
GM's, at least every one that I have ever met and spoken to all value that quality of post, ask that players make they're posts longer and add more details to ensure a quality that everyone can not only work with but can help shape a story. I don't know ANYONE that has EVER said to just post and not care.
I think, that where ever this idea came from within the chat room, was vastly misunderstood and rather than perhaps get other perspective on it, it was just taken as is and run with it.
Don't Touch The Names.
Enough has changed, and quite a bit I personally don't like. Don't take the damn thing out, for crying out loud it's a stupid fun thing leave it alone.

### **Maldoravia** (2010-11-05 23:54:03)

I am going to make this a short explanation. It is a Star Wars game. The titles were and are a brilliant part of this site's design. I personally think they should be left ALONE. I even think the little lightsabers should be put back up. I -miss- that. Do I value quantity above quality? Hells to the no. Stuff like this helped make the site interesting...and seeing as the web-page has totally been demolished and raped...These were the only things left, other than the campaigns, that made this site interesting. The way this site is going...I see a sad future for it indeed. Please dont ruin a good thing and try to "fix" it if it wasnt broken to begin with?

Firstly... You DO realise we still have the Jedi Knights theme, and you can select it using the options of the User Control Panel? The generic skin you're seeing is exactly that - a generic forum, intended not to evoke any particular kind of setting or genre.
Secondly, the sad future for this site will be if it doesn't change. The fact of the matter is we will not get many more new players if all we can offer is Star Wars Saga. Most players willing to come to us for Saga already did during the period the system was still being published. Now it isn't, which means Saga is no longer a thing of the present but a thing of the past. Will we still play it? Yes. Will we still run it? Yes. Will we keep doing this for many, many years? Hopefully, yes.
But we need to think about offering more than just Star Wars games if we want the site to survive and expand in the coming years. Going "generic" doesn't hurt anybody - the Star Wars games are still there, as are the community members who like to run them and play in them. But now we're trying to focus on providing a better community for other people who might otherwise be put off. A consequence of this change is that Star Wars-themed titles, even if we kept the rank system, don't make any sense for the future of this community.
We can cling to the past if we want, cursing change as evil and unwanted, or we can just accept that it's what ANY niche website needs to do to survive in this crazy mixed up internet and *deal*. Nothing **important** has changed. You still have access to your sci-fi/Jedi themed skins. You still have access to your Star Wars games. Hell, we're currently still focusing on Star Wars in general, considering we're trying to get the Itara Cluster up and running.
There really isn't anything important to complain about.

### **myles1076** (2010-11-06 00:39:19)

Honestly this argument is a moot point, for the post counts anyway, because if anyone actually tried to get to any of the top tier ranks at the moment, they would have to post consistently once per day for around the next 30 years. The point is not the post count, its when you start questioning someones abilities or their sense of purpose that bruise ego's. Quality is purely an opinion, because when you tell someone what their doing isn't good enough they become discouraged from doing it again, this site is about the RPG community, not about picking things apart that are subjective. The ranking system is fine, its something nifty to look at by your name and no one in their right mind should take it seriously considering that the top rank is 1/3 of the total posts that have been put onto this site thus far. The purpose of this site is for people all over the world to get together and do something they enjoy that would be hard to accomplish in another venue.

I will attempt to address Zerah's and Maldo's posts here.
First things, this is not an emerging conflict, so let us not respond as if it were one. The primary reason that the titles, post counts, and posts themselves are being considered for removal is because in their aggregate they cause a considerable strain on the website. When the website has crashed or been offline in the past, it is because of everything we've had tied into the site has eaten up the bandwith and the ISP has cut us off. We could continue to glut the site with excess that no one is truly using or even reflecting upon anymore, but then the costs would go up and as the site is tied into Alicia's account, the costs would be handed directly to her.
Yes, Rowen implemented the titles initially, but when he handed administration of the website over to Alicia, she expanded the titles to their current degree, and single-handedly input the code for their current tracking and expansion. She also hand-codes the templates for posting, the different overlays for the site, the icons, the chat, the dice roller, and pretty much any other feature the site currently exhibits. If it does break or if someone has a new idea for the site, she implements them once again by hand, and she tries to do as best she can to make things remain operable with as much help as the moderators can provide. When a fun, yet completely ancillary thing is threatening to completely disable the site and prevent it from serving its intended purpose in providing a space for gaming of all types, then that minor thing should be sacrificed, and that is why I initially voted for them to be removed completely (yes, I know I was the lone vote there).
And has been stated previously, the primary purpose of this site is to provide space for gaming. Originally it was just for star wars, but now our number of non-star wars games rivals that of the currently active star wars games, and I think an expansion in all avenues will be welcome to the community. The changes that have been made, and will be made (make no mistakes, further changes will be made to keep the place functional and interactive) are not as some sort of judgement against the members and should not be viewed as such. I think no one here as said as such, and no one will. And I certianly hope that any further discussion going forward will proceed calmly and in an amiable fashion.

I want to address this, because what's interesting is that all the people who have been on the site the longest (and therefore have known Rowen the longest) - myself, Yogi, DA, Tru have either a) voted that change is okay or b) said/implied that they don't mind either way.
Back when the forum first started Rowen gave Tru and I equal ranks to him as Administrators, because he was new to running a forum, wanted the help, and valued people's input. I couldn't count the amount of times he PMed me asking for my opinion about how we should do something. Rowen was **pro-change**, forever trying to make adjustments here and there to make the site work better. Throughout our site's lifespan we have been Star Wars: Galactic Adventures, then Star Wars: Galactic Campaigns, then Galactic Campaigns. We have been hosted on no less than three forums. We even had the forum split in two once with a fantasy section. We've been on multiple webhosts. We've had data lost and corrupted and had to deal with it. We've had several different chat rooms, and dice rollers, and forum skins. And this is all **before** Rowen handed over to Alicia.
And Rowen handed over to Alicia because he was unable to commit the time anymore and trusted her to look after the site. Which she has done. As Anazider mentioned in his post before mine, it is actually Alicia that developed the rank system to how it looks today. Alicia has given us a quality chat, she's given us literally dozens of improvements on the forum, she's improved support for the players of Open RPG, and almost every day she has to put aside what she's doing and perform some manner of duty on the site.
If Rowen were available to comment right now, as someone who knew him from the very beginning as a fellow administrator and as a friend I can honestly say I'm sure he would agree that the only appropriate step for the community now is to advance it. That was his aim all through his time as our leader. But to be honest, even if he disagreed, it would *not* be rude to change the site. It was never *just* Rowen's, not since he first advertised on the Wizards of the Coasts boards and gave us a say in how the community would be run. He relinquished his right of veto when he appointed Alicia his successor - it is she who now administrates the site (Rowen's title is maintained out of respect rather than necessity), she who covers the **costs** of the site, and she who deserves our gratitude and consideration (so by all means, disagree if you want to, but never use words like "stupid").
Despite various improvements the site has changed remarkably little since Alicia took over. Much less than it changed under Rowen's leadership, I'd say. And it seems like we've gotten spoiled and forgotten it was Alicia that kept this community stable - hell, I'll say it: by taking on the financial responsibility for this forum, she's the SOLE reason this community still exists. So now she's proposing a change? Do me a favour and consider it properly rather than clinging to the comfort of the past. It's not going to hurt you or your games. It's not going to hurt the community. If it has any effect at all it will be to attract more players, and even players who come to play other systems may know Saga or be willing to try it out. We honestly can't "lose" here, we just have to be willing to let go of a few cosmetic details.
Is that so bad? I don't think so.

Firstly, I would like to state how much of an insult it is for you to position yourself as your words have placed you as though because you knew Rowen longer you there fore know all there is. Ro pmed me as well with new changes so I'm very well aware that he was attempting to make the site better. And why he chose Alicia? because she showed the most interest in helping to keep the place running and that she knew codes better than anyone he knew.
You think I'm not grateful that she's chosen to go through the hell of recoding and reformatting and keeping the prices up? wtf. You make it sound like because I'm arguing for keeping the titles that I'm saying all she's done sucks. When did I imply that? where did you read that?
Beside the point. if the titles are eating up too much bandwidth than perhaps one might think of a way to keep them by yet again, recoding or attempting to make them smaller in size. There are other solutions to fixing the problem then just throwing out something fun and interesting. Remember the lightsabers? personally I hated when they went away, but the trade was that the titles became niftery. So what you want to do is not only throw the titles out but put only two and nothing to them in it's place. Where the hell is the win there? Titles are badges of honor for how many posts you have contributed to the site wherever they may be, that's why they're fun and why people love them, because it's awesome to see your title change to something new and show it off.
So how is it a can't lose? because the bandwidth will be reduced, there won't be anything there to have to manage anymore so the work load will do down and new people that come in won't know what they had missed except by seeing this debate when they enter? Where's the win. new people? great. you can get that anyway, oh wait, we HAVE been getting them anyway. Lower bandwidth? fine, I can see that but again, has it been tried yet to find a way to make them smaller and still keep them or was that just thrown out the window in favor of having less work? If it's too much work, delegate someone to help with it. There is no reason to be rid of them save to be rid of them. I think that's poor managing, and if there's no reason than keep the damn things!

Sam, please settle down. Hyperbole and insult, whether felt or expressed, will serve absolutely no purpose here. This is a discussion about receiving the imaginary title of Jedi Master next beneath a fictitious username on an electronic forum, not an argument over life changing politics. <!-- s:- -->![:icon_neutral:](https://i.ibb.co/zdkGtP3/icon-neutral.gif)<!-- s:- -->P
This is not something that we arrived at last week. This is a discussion that we, the site admins, have been having over the last handful of months in an attempt to keep the place running. I would hope that the most fun and most interesting aspect of this website are the games, and more importantly, its players, and not data reflected in a stat counter. And those games and that playerbase are what are most important to us, and what we are attempting to maintain. I am willing to sacrifice all manner of Knight, Grand Moff, and Super Soldier to keep all of us here together and enjoying our hobby. To that extent, I have been contributing out of my own pocket to the site to absorb costs and keep every facet of the place intact, but we have reached a breaking point where that is just no longer economically feasible or desired.
Likewise, if anyone else on the boards has php, BBCode, and Java-coding experience, yourself included Sam, we would gladly accept whatever coding you have found to completely resolve this issue, as we have yet to find one and have been continually searching, and continually implementing every idea we have come across. Over the month of October we had to step up our board trimming efforts in an attempt to break even, and Alicia, once again, hand-tweaked the site almost every day to keep it going. This wasn't an arbitrary, or completely out of the blue decision, it has been calculated and decided that this is the best avenue to proceed with.
Let us make no mistakes as to why we are here: to game. To enjoy one another's company in enacting a hobby that we all love. Not stats or statistics. If not having the message board title of Scout, or graphical lightsaber completely destroys anyone's ability to enjoy roleplaying with ones comrades here on the boards, then I must apologize in that I know little else to say. But I must stress this explicitly: We will do what we think is best to make sure everyone has a space to continue to enjoy their games and express their creativity in whatever fashion resonates with them most. If that amounts to removing a completely trivial system, which we originally did not have and seemed to have been doing fine with then, then that is what I will support and wholly endorse.

### **zerah** (2010-11-06 15:10:08)

Fine, here, after speaking with Ana and perhaps calming down I bit I propose this solution. Forget the post counting as that seems to be an issue, and simply give all new comers the two new titles you want (though I wouldn't use adventurer or whatever it's going to be as that just sounds blah) and allow everyone that has been here to retain the titles they have earned. Be it Grand Master, Mod, Donator, Jedi master or whatever. It keeps people happy and you get your less trouble thing.
And I would suggest seeking out either a computer programmer in college or a forum of them and ask -them- for coding help.

If anyone has any suggestions on a universal, yet fun name to use in place of Adventurer, then I am all ears.

To this, again if anyone knows anyone else outside of the phpbb3 and mod forums I frequent, which is where I get most of my help when I am having trouble, who may be interested in volunteering their time maintaining the site as a whole, please let me know. Perhaps I should mention I am a web programming student, working on this as part of an educational experience and for my own passion and love for RPGs as a whole.

### **Anonymous** (2010-11-06 23:31:33)

i have to say for a discussion... it seems like our opinions were completely overridden. i agree that we should leave the names. they are cool and they show who is contributing most to your sites success so as a person who has not posted alot why are you taking them away? they show who the vets are. this is like taking away a man's service stripes, or taking away his campaign ribbons. those things show that he fought hard and worked hard to serve his country.. well these names show how long and hard the people have worked to make this site a success and to make their games a success. no one on this forum tries to post grind to get better rank but i know who the person was that made the comment and you think is putting "to much stock" in the name system and frankly he is a DAMN good gm and has worked hard and brought many many players onto this site including yours truly. and to take away his campaign medals is wrong. and to say what you said about him is wrong. he does not put "to much stock" in the system and he DEFINITELY does not have quantity over quality. his games and posts are great and always always informative and well written. this is a site for the players not the moderators. im just saying....

Just to express some opinion on this. I think it is a question of what you really want the titles to represent, and what you mean by contributing to the site. For example, I´ve seen several members on this site who pretty much only posts in game forums, never saying anything in general discussions, never involving themselves with any of the community projects, and so on, as well as the other way around. I don´t mean to offend or point at anyone, but IMO they aren´t contributing very much to the site and community as a whole, as opposed to people who often puts input in discussions regarding the site development or answering the questions of new members. Which is why I think post count might be a bad basis for rank (if we would have them), though I don´t have a better suggestion at the moment. Finally, it seems like you´re taking it a bit personal. As far as I understand it (I wasn´t in on the chat discussions), it was someone losing a lot of post count when an inactive game was removed. It´s nothing personal, as that happends to everyone.
Just a comment on changing the names of the titles as well. Personally I think we should keep the SW related names, mainly because I like them and I don´t think that changing them would do a lot towards making this a "general" RPG site. If we look at it, we´ve got specialized sections for Star Wars PbP Games/Discussions, most of us have SW-themed avatars (and we´ve had options not to have for a very long time), and pretty much anything anyone will ever find in the archives is SW-related. My point being, if we´re going to make this site more general, there are other things to take into consideration as well, and other changes that should probably be considered as well.

Most of this doesn't seem to actually be about the titles.
I'm sensing some feelings akin to the changes being equivalent to something being taken away from them, which seems natural given the emotional investments into this place that I'm sure exist. However, from where I sit that stands counter-productive to the goal of expanding the community and bringing others to enjoy and create experiences like those that most of you hold so dearly, which seem to have attached themselves to the issue of the titles. A broader perspective is kinda required and change is only inherently bad unless it's for its own sake. Decentralizing the site away from a genre people feel passionately about shouldn't really offer any conflict, except in irrational feelings of entitlement, as you're brought together by the content itself not the theme of where you wish to enjoy it. The less exclusive it is, whether simply implied or not, the greater volume of people it may attract is the grander plan from what I've gleaned.
GC is not the shining Utopian trampoline, it's more like a tree fort out in the middle of no where. When interest has waned, and the old guard have moved on, there must be someone to maintain what others worked so hard to build and protect in order for it to persevere and mean as much to someone a long time from now as it does to you.
Now none of this is epitomized solely in the issue we're talking about, but it is what I'm sure is the first step towards insuring the continued existent and expanding success of this home.
But wtf do I know, I'm really just here so I can post limericks from time to time.

I've kept off the boards on this but there are a few things in this post that bother me
Sarin are you really making this a "us vs. them" Mods against regular users. Please don't go there as that is not the case.
Also the fact that you are comparing post counts and a titles to the stripes and ribbons that service men and women have earned with sweat, blood and even their lives is so ridiculous and incomprehensible I'm speechless. This is an RPG forum. Not serving your country.
And lets stop with "this GM or this person" We all know who it was that had the conversation with the mods in the chat, of which I was one, last Monday. What i find surprising is that DreamWalker has not commented in here yet because when all was said and done when the conversation was over he was ok with it and the explanations that were given.
It seems to me, and this is just my opinion, that despite saying that he was ok with loosing the posts that were in his OOC thread in his game *Into the Storm*, he isn't. If he is ok with it, why are there people in here with arms raised? Ready to, from what it sounds like, quit the site? I don't get it. If it's such a big deal why didn't DW say something when the OOC section of *Heart and Shadows*, his previous game, were removed causing his post count to go down then?
Also it was never said that DW was not a good GM or valuable person here because of his high post count. One thing I did day to him on Monday was..."did the lower post count make him any less of a GM or contributor to the site?" He said it didn't. Again, in my opinion, I wonder if that's really the case.
We're all here for one thing, gaming with friends. And I have made, from my experience here, some pretty good friends. None of whom I want to see leave over something that I see as a minor thing. And that is only my opinion that no one has given me. I'm a grown man and I can think for myself.
One of the things I have mentioned to Alicia is maybe there could be more than one ranking system. One SW and an more generic one. As of the other night she wasn't sure that could be implemented. If it can it would require considerable work.
Come on people lighten up and just enjoy what we do here. Game and chat with friends.

This is quite correct. I want to add that the fact that the Moderation team are pro-change or adopting a neutral stance on this is not because we are "out to get you", it's just that these are our genuine opinions after processing the debates we have been having for several weeks. When Alicia (or another mod) has an idea that they think will be beneficial to the site the idea gets tossed around informally by the mod staff as a sounding board before we decide if it's logical, feasible, and desirable: if it seems to meet these criteria then it becomes a more official proposal and can be presented to the rest of the site; if it doesn't, then we've wasted no one's time but our own.
So yes, we did have previous communication on this issue: but all this means is that we were not surprised to see this post, and we had already had time to work out which idea out of all the options we want to support. That's all there is to it, we are **not** banded against you.
As a Moderator I don't want to have to "fight" the community, and I certainly don't want the community to "fight" me. I come to this site to play games, to run games, to hang out with my internet buddies, and generally have fun. If I wanted arguments over how the room was going to be decorated I'd go visit my family. It's like Yogi said: I'd rather just enjoy what we do here.

### **Anonymous** (2010-11-07 12:41:32)

but this is a star wars site... people come here to play star wars.. and as a veteran i can say yes it is like taking rank. not all service members truly earn their stripes but rank is rank. i just used that as a comparison do not take things so literally please. and to be honest this discussion became more than just a discussion about the titles the moment alicia said quantity over quality and when the "to much stock" comment was made. and to be honest as far as i can see only the mods are arguing pro name change and most of the players have argued to keep the names and ranks... so why are we still having this discussion. i want to see the success of this site. i would like to see 100s of people in here. i have been inactive for a long time because of my recent deployment. but now that im back i see a site that i love so much trying to become something else entirely. we come here because this is a place for star wars lovers to hang and talk and play. taking this site away from all that will not end well i promise you. i respect your positions but that is just a position. try to take some input from us please. taking this site from star wars is like taking away car parts from auto zone. we go to auto zone to buy car parts.. not groceries, or toys, or electronics... this is a star wars site, not a l5r site, or a dnd site, or a fantasy craft site. if i want to play those ill go to a different site that is completely dedicated to those things. and i would like to not see the admin and logistics involved in the decision making you are here to admin not decide. thank you all for all your hard work at making this a wonderful star wars site, but let the players decide, if a player not a mod has an argument to my comments i will glady respond otherwise dont count on my replys. and as far as counter productive. come up with new ideas for star wars stuff, like a constant 24 hour pbp room where people can meet up and game for single sessions or etc. or come up with a huge game that can include tons of people. maybe a short battle or something, the goal of any company is to attract new customers while still appeasing the loyal life long ones. and on posts contributing to the site. if people come in and see 30 people on this site and only say 100 posts yea those may be some awesome posts but why would they want to stay it just shows inactivity and no opportunities. large post numbers show that the site is active and alive and people with a cool title from 1000 posts we will say either A. shows me a player who is serious and wants to play or B. shows me a GM who runs lots of games and runs them often and well giving players more chances to enjoy the site, not just some dude who only plays when he has nothing better to do or is bored of playing his xbox. i want people who are active and alive not eh i have nothing better to do so lets just see whats up. this place is about playing games not talking about life... if i want to talk about life ill go to facebook. and new players are going to look for games on their own they dont need us to hold their hand in helping them find a new game. so seeing a game with 100 posts probably is not where they want to go, but seeing one with 1000 posts hey this is the place to be. the titles honestly have nothing to do with this conversation its all about how you get them and the post count is extremely important.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2010-11-07 12:57:35)

Sarin, why do you make such a big deal of separating mods/admins from "players"? As far as I´m concerned, we´re all players, since we´re all here to play games and have fun. Okay, I´ve seen some people who´ve been here and never been part of a game, but that´s fine as well. Point being, we´re all members of this site, and we should all have equal say in stuff related to it. Though naturally it will become those who are the most active in discussions regarding the site that will have the most input, but that´s just the natural way it works. And if you say that you feel like the opinions of non-mods/admins are being overrun, then I say you seem to be proposing the opposite thing: That mods/admins´s opinions should count for less just because they have that position.
About switching this site away from a SW theme, personally I think it works well as it is, and if we look at it as it is, we have about equal share of SW games and other games, so I don´t think having an SW focus will "scare" people from using other systems. My opinion on the titles I stated in my precious post, but if we´re going to make a big overhaul to really make this a generic site, we should take a larger discussion. But there again, if you want to have a say, you need to participate in the discussion, none of us here have mind-reading powers.
I just hope you´re sensible enough to at least read this comment, even though I´m a mod.

### **Alicia** (2010-11-07 13:59:07)

I fear some confusion along the line has been inferred that post counts are just going to completely disappear. They are not.
What is being proposed is the removal of the rank titles which are attributed to them (NonHeroic, Scout, Scoundrel, Jedi, etc). All Special ranks (Game Master, Donator, Mod and Admin titles) will remain with the future inclusion of new special ranks/titles in the future to recognize members.
And personally, Sarin, I'm rather insulted that even though I am a moderator/admin, that I have been set apart from any other player. Inferring from your statement, I would be set apart from your other players (should you ever run a game) and not be given my respective opinion as such.
Honestly, if I didn't feel the opinions of the community were important, why, I ask you, would I have put up this thread?
Also I ask now, if this site could offer more than Star Wars games as a Roleplaying site, why is that so bad? We would be welcoming other prospective members who may not necessarily want to play in Star Wars, but may later wish to learn. Maybe even members from other communities of single system sites who may just want a single home for their roleplaying experiences. By limiting our market to a system which isn't even in development any more, let alone being printed, we've essentially cut off ourselves from a viable market of other roleplaying systems and those who play in them.
Until such time as Lucas finds someone to take the Star Wars roleplaying franchise, what we have is what there is in official Star Wars roleplaying systems. While we, as current players of the system, hope that others will pick up the game and have interest in it, there will be nothing more coming from the official channels, most likely not even additional printing runs, limiting the available copy of books and conceivably the amount of interested players. This in the long run could severely hamper the continued survival of our community if we don't begin to prepare for that inevitability.
Having digressed enough from the initial topic of the Future of the Ranking system numerous times. I'm considering this discussion closed. The poll will remain open and should anyone wish to voice suggestions or alternatives, they may PM me or any of the moderator staff.
(( The PM compose has a fantastic feature where you can choose groups to send to, so you could even send it to all of us at once. ))
Edit: I just realized by locking the thread it closed the voting. If you would still like to vote, you may send me your vote and I will do a final tally.
Deadline is November 12.

**Update**: Style based ranks have been implemented as being the agreed upon solution for this discussion by the site's council. Rank images will change depending on which theme a user is using.
Right now, however, CA Orbital, Xabblue (default), and Xtreme are sharing the same rank images till unique images can be made.
