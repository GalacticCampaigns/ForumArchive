# Why isn't my PM function working?

### **Anonymous** (2009-09-04 16:26:19)

This message is displayed on my private message page:
You have 1 private message currently on hold because of full folder.
Release all on-hold messagesâ€¦ they will be re-sorted into the appropriate folder if enough space is made available.
I have deleted every single message in my inbox, outbox and sent folders, but I can't get this error message to go away and let me have the PM I know is waiting. What am I doing wrong?

Hmm, sounds odd. Whenever that message comes up, I just clear out some of my inbox, and then presses it again to release all held messages.

I hope this is not it but when you delete your messages you have to hit yes to confirm .... when you go back into your PM are the messages deleted? Also you have a 50 storage limit and should delete to that. I hope this helps <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> let me know if it does not.

Nope, that wasn't the problem, and I've deleted everything.

Have you clicked the message again to release all messages on hold?

The error message isn't clickable, and I don't see anything else to click to release the message. Logging out and back in hasn't changed anything.
It gets weirder. I just sent myself a PM and it went through fine, but the error message is still there. What am I missing?

Hmm...I could swear that there was some clickable part of that message that would release all held PMs.

Oops, you were right...missed it the first time somehow. Problem solved! Thanks a ton.
