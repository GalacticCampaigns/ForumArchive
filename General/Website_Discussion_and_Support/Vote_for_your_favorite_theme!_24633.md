# Vote for your favorite theme!

### **Alicia** (2010-04-29 10:19:58)

I'm redesigning the front page of the website to match the forum. Right now, I don't know of a suitable way to make it so the style changes with the user, so a default style will need to be picked.
This is where the community comes in. Vote on your favorite style. If there's a style not listed that you have seen which you think would work wonderfully for the community, post a link to the style here.
Please keep this in mind:
While we have a majority of Star Wars games, we also provide a slew of non SW campaigns as well. It is my opinion that the site should exhibit our diversity. Also keep in mind, some of the styles demo'ed below are unfinished. If you have ideas on how to make it unique for the site feel free to post them here as well.

I got the same error, so I'll just post my vote. I vote Jedi Knights.

### **Alicia** (2010-04-30 13:19:43)

What is your current default style. The one you are using when you vote?
EDIT: I've fixed it for those using JediKnights. Doing the others now.

clicking the little links does nothing for me, and I had wanted to see the other ones before voting.

odd what browser are you using?
Most of them can be seen by changing your default style changed through the user control panel and then board settings.

I dig the Divine Black ... I also like the Star Trek one, but didn't feel it was the theme for a primarily SW board <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) --> Mind you, I also dig the Jedi Knight one <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I never completed adding all the extras it required. If many people show an interest in it I'll finish once improvements to the site are done.

Just tested the links on Mozilla v3.5.9 and they worked fine.
Edit: I think I know what's happening. The link are only working for Mods and up. I have supplied a pdf with screenies of all the styles.

### **Alicia** (2010-05-06 13:47:05)

Not sure how I like this, but I found a portal we could use as the homepage. Anything else I should be able to adapt from it for the wiki and any other pages.
What do you think? <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/test/](http://galacticcampaigns.com/test/ "http://galacticcampaigns.com/test/")<!-- m -->

### **Magical2099** (2010-05-06 15:03:56)

its the standard 3 column design, nothing wrong with it. need to format the header bar so it spans the page but beyond that its cool.

---

### **Alicia** (2010-05-06 22:01:55)

Been messing with it and think I have it looking the way I would want our front page.
Is the header still messing up? I've tried chrome, IE 7 and Mozilla and it looks fine to me.

I have to say, it fixed itself. LOL
Messing with the new wiki version I want to implement. Don't think I can get the style to change as well which makes me sad. Seeing hardly any support for changing styles on it. I may forgo the wiki for a bit and install a new feature I think everyone would like...
