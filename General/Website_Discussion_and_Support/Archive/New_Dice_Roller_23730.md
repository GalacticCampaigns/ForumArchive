# New Dice Roller

### **Rowen** (2009-01-11 11:34:09)

I have obtained permission from Ian Toltz at Asmor.com to host his dice roller on Galactic Campaigns. Hope everyone enjoys the functionality this one provides over the old dice roller.

Yeah! asmor.com
Sorry for the outburst. Just really love his site. 4e needs more unofficial support.

Since Siteground has placed a CPU usage counter on the site I can view just how much we are using. It has remained relatively low so I thought I could add the dice roller back to the site. Here is the link:

Enjoy!

NP MoDa, We also have the links for the Dice Roller and Chat room on the navigation bar at the top of the site. We can thank Alicia for that bit of coding. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
