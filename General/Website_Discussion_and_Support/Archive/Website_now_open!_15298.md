I am proud to announce that Star Wars Galactic Campaigns is now open for registration for those interested. I believe that everything is in order for members to start submitting content. Hope everyone likes the new addition to our Star Wars home!

You used Joomla! that's cool. I'm just starting to learn how to use that CMS too. I love the new site.
One thing I can't seem to find was that old Dice Roller.. could you direct me to the link or maybe its not up.. it would be cool to have it up again.
