# Poll ending 12-16-2008

This poll was actually a two parter and I would like to share the results with everyone since Iâ€™m ending it. The first poll was:
**1. GM's, What is your favorite Era to run games in?**
a. Rebellion Era â€“ won with over 10 votes
b. Rise of the Empire Era â€“ with 7 votes
c. Old Republic Era â€“ with 5 votes
d. Legacy Era â€“ with 3 votes
e. New Republic Era â€“ with 2 votes
f. New Jedi Order Era â€“ no votes
**2. Players, Whats your favorite Era to play in?**
a. Rebellion Era â€“ won with over 15 votes
b. Old Republic Era â€“ with 8 votes
c. Rise of the Empire Era â€“ with 6 votes
d. New Republic Era â€“ with 1 vote
e. Legacy and New Jedi Order Era â€“ no votes
Rebellion Era was the over all winner in both polls. While the rest of the Eraâ€™s varried between the two polls. Also, only 27 GMâ€™s voted on their favorite Era while 30 players voted.
Iâ€™ll see if I can come up with more interesting polls in the future and keep this a reoccuring feature on the site. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
