# NPC Generator

### **Rowen** (2009-01-09 20:37:12)

I have been in communication with Todd Zircher about his NPC generator. He has granted me permission to host his program 'A Cast of Thousands' on Galactic Campaigns. With this browser based program the user has the ability to select from some basic selections such as Race, Class, Level, Gender, and Age. Hit the generate button and your NPC is created.
This will soon be posted and usable Under the 'Holonet' section of the site in the subsection 'Utilities'. I hope all GM's can find this aid useful.

Cool!  I can't wait to try it out.

It works!  The character it produced wasn't too shabby, either, though it ignored one of the base classes (I had set it for Scout3/ Jedi7 and ended up with Jedi 10), but otherwise, it will save me a lot of trouble in the future.
