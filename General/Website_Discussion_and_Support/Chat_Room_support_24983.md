# Chat Room support

### **Alicia** (2011-02-15 18:43:26)

As we are now in the process of testing the new version of ProChatRooms. Please take some time to run the chat through it's paces. The more problems found now, the less we'll have to deal with later.
If you have a mobile device which supports web, please visit the site and let us know of your experience. When you do so, please indicate what device you are using.
Please report all bugs and issues with the chat in this thread using the following:

```

```

Attach a screen shot (see below) or paste the code error
You can take a screen shot by hitting ALT + print screen. The print screen button comes after F12 on most keyboards. By hitting ALT first you take a screen shot of the active program (your browser in this case).
After you capture the screen shot, open paint. It's found on most Windows OS in Start > Programs > Accessories. With Paint open hit CTRL + V to paste the image. Save the file as a jpg to memorable location and it is ready to upload.
Alternatively, Vista and Windows 7 have a Snipping Tool (just open Start and search for Snipping Tool).
