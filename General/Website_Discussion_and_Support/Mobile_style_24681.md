# Mobile style?

### **Yogi** (2010-06-05 07:43:39)

What's with the mobile style that all of a sudden appears on my iPod? Is this a new addition? Was it done for speed?

Yes, it's something I started working on last night. Meant to turn it off before I went to bed, but I essentially passed out. It's not finished yet. Hoping to finish the actual style and modify the Portal today.
What do you think of it so far, Dave?
Anyone who wishes to check out what it is I'm working on can go here: <!-- l -->[index.php?style=12](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/index.php?style=12 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/index.php?style=12")<!-- l --> on your computer.
The style itself is pretty much done now.
Edit: Now the portal page is done.

To be honest I liked it the other way like
when I'm on my pc. I'm not used to it but it's faster. It'll grow on me probably. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Let's try it out for a week or so and see what happens. I may be changing the layout a little bit for the forum to look more like the normal forum. Similar to how it looks on the portal.

Looking for some input to make the Mobile page better. The goal of the mobile theme is to make browsing on a mobile device easier, increase load time and to take up less data.
What would you like to see? What needs to be changed?
Submit your list here.

I would like an option to view in default web page for smart phone users.

I'll have to figure out how google does it. But with the way phpbb coding works it may have to be one or the other.
So again. What would you like to see on the mobile page to make it better?

I wouldn't mind seeing the "buttons" for bold and italic text like on the main site. Would make it easier to set bold and italic text.

Formatting buttons have been added. I'll eventually look into how to get colors to show up in a drop down.
