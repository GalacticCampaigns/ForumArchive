# Member Advertisment (Postcards and flyers)

### **Alicia** (2010-11-14 12:08:44)

With the help of Sketchpad, I have been putting into consideration the creation of postcards and flyers which members can post and hand out at game stores and conventions. I wanted to get an idea of who all might be interested in helping to advertise in this manner.
Because of this fantastic sale I found for post cards I was considering buying them in bulk and then anyone interested in buying them at discount would be able to buy them from me, the proceeds going to the maintenance of the site. At bulk price the postcards would be $0.05 per unit which means I could easily sell them to members at $.20 per unit though at the moment I'm not including shipping. Looking at Kinkos, printing of these cards is about double that.
With Sketch's permission, the postcard files would be made available to members interested in printing their own batches. Members would also be encouraged to make their own flyers, but I request they be sent to me for approval.
My overall idea for the flyers and postcards was to leave a place for members to put their username/user id so we could keep track of who was referred to the site by who. Additionally, we could also give a special number to each event so we can further track results. Not only will this promote the site, but be a fun way to earn achievements/awards based on how many a particular member has recruited active members. I was also even considering making the Supporter status be a grand prize after inviting members who remained active for a certain time.
I request you answer the following:

1. **Would you be interested in passing out the flyers/postcards?**
2. **How often do you think you'd be able to do so?** (yearly basis)
3. **Would you buy postcards from Alicia at the price listed above?** (restricted to those in the US at the moment)
4. **How many do you think you might start with?**
5. **Do you have any other suggestions/comments?**

I pledge my support to advertise the site! I would pay and be able to do the work; most likely once a week. As long as I don't have to design the fliers! lol

Some of the easiest ways to advertise is at local game stores, most have boards to advertise games. Once the postcards and flyers are created it would be a simple matter of dropping one off the next time one was at a game store.

Thanks everyone for your responses so far.
Right now, I'm mainly trying to get a gauge on how many of you would use the postcards, whether you would buy them from the site, and how many you might purchase initially. As I'm looking to order these in bulk I don't want to order too many if there's no interest and I want to order enough to last a while if there is.

I have posted some web banners up here <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php")<!-- m -->
You can also locate them via the nav bar under "Resources".
Please feel free to use them on other forums to advertise our community.
If you would like to make your own and would like to share, just PM it to me and I can include it to our directory.
This will also be where you will be able to find the flyers when they are released.
