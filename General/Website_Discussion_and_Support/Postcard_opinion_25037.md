# Postcard opinion

### **Alicia** (2011-05-31 12:30:42)

Hey all! Thanks to Sketchpad we now have an awesome image for our postcards. I'm getting ready to order a huge batch of postcards, which may be purchased by members at a later time (looking at $.10/card)
I, however, need the communities help getting the final look of the card just right.
Here's what I have for the front cover:
[attachment=2]<!-- ia2 -->Postcard-psPrint with words.jpg<!-- ia2 -->[/attachment]
or
[attachment=0]<!-- ia0 -->Postcard-psPrint-with-words.jpg<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment]
or
[attachment=1]<!-- ia1 -->Postcard-psPrint.jpg<!-- ia1 -->[/attachment]
I'll have images for the back up soon. For now tell me which front art you like better.
If you have an alternate suggestion or have an idea to make what I have better, let me know as well.

Here's an option for the back.

I voted for the text in the top right, but it looks great - the back too! Kings to you both! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I voted for the second one, with the text diagonally. I like have text "interact" with images.
While the images are really great (nice job Sketch), my personal preference would still be to have some SW-related motive, and also somewhere in the text emphasize that we are (or at least have been) specializing in Star Wars games. I cut out a portion of my post as I drifted OT, but to sum up, I´d rather have a SW-style picture than something that looks like it comes from a comic book (no critique to Sketch, once again the pics are great).

We can probably do a SW one down the line. I felt it more important to do a generic one as this will reach a broader range of people with diverse interests.

Out of the two I can see, I go for the middle one <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
Since our entire playerbase seems to be SW based, I think it's in the site's best interest to expand the base into other areas. More players, more people, and then you gain momentum from there.

That's just cool, only the one fella in the back doesn't look like something that could come outta Star Wars lol. I voted for top right, There's that big empty spot up there that's just right for some text.
