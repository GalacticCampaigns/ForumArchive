# Casting Calls Location Discussion

### **Alicia** (2011-07-21 12:33:52)

It has been brought to my attention there's some aversion to the location of the Casting Calls currently due to the fact it's hard to identify when there are new posts in the Casting Calls.
I can understand this, which is why I wanted to open the floor to get any recommendations in how to reorganize the particular section or discover a way to make it easier to identify when there are new calls out there.
The forum is set up as it is now to give it a cleaner appearance. Before we had individual forums for the respective Star Wars eras and an individual one for the General gaming area seen from the index page. In an effort to make the forum index look more streamlined, the forums were consolidated and placed with the game forums rather than having them in their own forum.
My solution would be to once again put ALL casting calls in the same forum to be viewable from the index page. This would include putting the General gaming section casting calls there to be seen with the Star Wars. Likewise, this could include calls/invitations to participate in Virtual Tabletop games and Freeform.
An alternate solution is to keep games where they are, but institute a new Newsletter specifically for Casting Calls. Since newsletters are sent out to members via their mailing addresses, members will be more likely informed of the posting of a new Call. The downside to this is the newsletter would have to be sent out manually and the GM would have to be sure to send a Staff member the required information. A way to insure this is the dual institution of a form which would not only post the Casting Call, but provide adequate information for the newsletter post there might even be a way to link the two so when the form is filled out both (Casting Call and Newsletter article) are posted.

Personally I could see them merged together with the Interest Checks forum in some way, as those to tend to go pretty close together.

^^^ This! I like this. or a subforum divided in two like DA is talking about, one sub for interests, one for casting.

Having all the casting calls in one section makes sense, one should not have to dig for a new game.

Since there was consensus in the idea of merge the Interest check and Casting Call forum I have done so and have subsequently updated the "GMs Please Read First" post.
I ask you please take a look.
What do you think about the newsletter idea? It has the potential to draw in the people who may not frequent the boards often enough to catch a Casting Call in the first place.

Looks good. The news letter idea can't hurt either.

Is it really that big an issue?
Well if it's cause for complaint the best thing to do is to put the casting call forum visibly on the front page again. I think it makes sense for Interest Checks to become a subforum of Casting Calls too, there always was overlap there.

I agree with Simply's idea. Make casting calls it's own forum from index page and have interest checks be a sub topic.
