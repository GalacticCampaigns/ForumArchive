I now request anyone experiencing troubles with the site follow this procedure and post your experience in a new thread:
Browser: (Chrome, IE, FireFox, etc)
Board Style: (xabbBlue, xtreme, JediKnights, etc. If you don't know the name it's generally listed in the footer.)
Problem: (Summary of the problem)
Steps to replicate problem: (What did you click on to get the error, where on the site, etc)
Attach a screen shot or paste code error (please put in code box)

```
[b]Browser:[/b]
[b]Board Style:[/b]
[b]Problem:[/b]
[b]Steps to replicate problem:[/b]
```

You can take a screen shot by hitting ALT + print screen. The print screen button comes after F12 on most keyboards. By hitting ALT first you take a screen shot of the active program (your browser in this case).
After you capture the screen shot, open paint. It's found on most Windows OS in Start > Programs > Accessories. With Paint open hit CTRL + V to paste the image. Save the file as a jpg to memorable location and it is ready to upload.
Alternatively, Vista and Windows 7 have a Snipping Tool (just open Start and search for Snipping Tool).
