# Source of Updates: Twitter and/or Facebook

### **Alicia** (2012-01-25 09:37:21)

I would like to open for discussion a format to receive continual updates regarding say site events, interesting discussions, new casting calls, etc.
While we have a Twitter and a Facebook page I was wondering if there was one people used over the other that could be used as a focus.
Alternatively if anyone has other ideas I would love to hear them as well.
While I put the newsletter up as a poll option, I would like to comment that it's generally easier to write a short and sweet Twitter and Facebook update than a weekly newsletter. Perhaps it's me, but I would prefer to send a Monthly or bi-monthly. Additionally, as it takes a lot of effort for one person to write a good newsletter if anyone would like to volunteer time to help with that, it would be extremely helpful and worthwhile to everyone!

For me:
I'd prefer a newsletter.
I think twitter and facebook are great resources to use for traffic generation. However for me to receive updates, it's nigh on impossible due to restraints placed on me at work I wouldn't be able to check either of those for the best part of the day. The only contact I have with the site is the occassional refresh of my browser or the rss feeds for the topic's I'm following. I couldn't tell you anything about anyone else's games or how to get involved. A one line update on each of the players in the respectives GM's games might be interesting: Reality Bytes: Jason's overcome the Arena and is now in a hunt. Marina has landed on Tat with Joran and has met OB1. ? I dunno.

I chose Facebook *and* the newsletter. Here's why:
Facebook allows for the quick and easy stuff, plus it will help spread news of the site. A lot of what's already been started can continue as far as site-to-site collaboration and whatnot. You could advertise with a one-line synopsis of the latest newsletter as well.
A newsletter doesn't have to have huge fancy articles or anything - what jaybee3 said about game recaps may be all that's needed at times. Maybe any new CC's or policies and interesting links to round it out. Of course the fancy articles would be welcome, just not mandated.
Although I suppose now that I think about it you can post weekly updates on the FB page too... I guess it doesn't much matter as far as that goes then. I do think the idea of regular updates is a really wise one though. Perhaps focusing on a nice FB post once/week that includes all that but then also collecting them in an archive thread on the site too?
