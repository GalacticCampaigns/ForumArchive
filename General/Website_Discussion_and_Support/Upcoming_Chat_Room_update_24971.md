# Upcoming Chat Room update

### **Alicia** (2011-01-27 20:28:09)

Pro Chat Rooms released news on Jan 13 they will be introducing a new version of their product. While the software will need to be repurchased (at 50% discount) I am rather excited about the upcoming features and believe it will be worth it. The beta is already proving to be more stable than our current version and not as resource intensive.
Right now there is no definitive date on the products release to the public. As of right now, their release schedule is allowing use of it on their servers for testing purposes before it will be released to developers.
I'm anticipating the cost to upgrade will be $35, which will include purchasing the File Share plugin we currently have installed.
> **:: Pro Chat Rooms - Version 7**
> 100% re-coded from scratch this isn&#39;t just an update, it&#39;s totally new chat room software!
> Maximised for performance* and minimised for editing with much easier to read source code for developers we hope you will enjoy version 7 as much as we enjoyed developing it.
> *Version 7 now uses only 1 XML file for database interaction which helps reduce both bandwidth and resources (when compared to multiple files used in version 6 and below).
> **:: Screenshots**
> Below are several screenshots of the new Pro Chat Rooms 7 software. These images are approx 800 wide x 600 high to give you a basic idea of how the software looks.
>
> * General Login - This screenshot shows the new style template which includes the optional &#39;Login Gallery&#39; plugin. You will notice we have now added a &#39;Latest News&#39; feature which allows admins to add their latest news to the chat room login page.

> * Intellibot updated to replace the &#39;vote to kick&#39; option in version 6. The intellibot now gives user 3 warnings for abusive behaviour,

> * Replaced IRC type &#39;/status&#39; messages with selectable status messages via drop down list
> * Replaced whisper feature so that,
>

>   - users can click usernames in chat messages to whisper other users
>
> * Updated IRC dice roll to include +/- modifier options
> * Updated admin &#39;kick&#39; option. Users can now be kicked for XXX time preventing immediate re-login.
>
> **:: Plugin Updates**

>
> * One2One
>
>   Chat request notifications are now displayed in unblockable dynamic divs which appear in the lower right hand corner of the users PC/Mac monitor window (in the same place as MSN/Yahoo notifications appear). This replaces the browser popup windows used in version 6 and previous versions.
>   One2One chat requests now feature the ability for multiple users to chat with the same &#39;receiver&#39; at the same time in one chat window. This is achieved by dynamically creating each &#39;receiver&#39; their own chat room where multiple users can login and have access to all the features found in the main chat room.
>   The main difference between previous versions of this plugin and version 7 is the One2One plugin now upgrades the Pro Chat Rooms software to a One2One Chat System by replacing the &#39;general&#39; chat room with a single chat room for each user. It is not possible to use the Pro Chat Rooms as a general chat room and enable the One2One chat system at the same time.

Beta testing has been opened to the public for the next few days!

Remember to include the following details in your post,
**# What did you do to produce the bug?**
For example, I clicked 'that' and 'this' happened.

Its a good idea, where possible, to check bugs using more than 1 browser as the bug may not affect all browsers.

Does the bug only happen with XXX users in the room or with just 1?
Please copy and past the text below (answering each question in turn) and include this with your bug report.
