# Community Support and Advertisement (Please Read)

### **Alicia** (2011-02-05 11:25:18)

Greetings everyone!
As the new year progresses I've been deliberating the future of this site as a whole, particularly something I think we all would like to see happen; member growth.
This year, I propose we all work together in the common goal of expanding our member base. This isn't something I can do alone. Last year, back in November I opened the floor to some suggestions in advertisement, mainly postcards and flyers which could be passed out at local game shops and conventions.
Another way to advertise is to pay facebook and other sites to host a banner as advertisements. This will unfortunately cost money and right now I'm loathe to draw from the money set aside for the site renewal. If anyone would like to volunteer to help sponsor any ads, please PM me. Also if you know of any sites which may be interested in doing a banner exchange,[funding an ad on our site](http://galacticcampaigns.com/advertise.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/advertise.php"), or [supporting us in any way](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24542 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24542"), I would be pleased to hear about it.
I had also considered placing an ad in the programs of various conventions ranging in the theme of Gaming/RPGs and Sci-fi/Fantasy. These might be a bit more affordable than running ad campaigns at the moment, but again sponsors for these ads would be a significant help.
Here are some conventions I was considering placing ads in:

[MARCON](http://marcon.org/wordpress/?page_id=62 "http://marcon.org/wordpress/?page_id=62") - Columbus, OH May 27-29
[Ba-Con](http://ba-con.org/ "http://ba-con.org/") - Columbus, OH July 8 -10
[Gen Con Indy](http://www.gencon.com/2011/indy/sm/eventmarketing/printads.aspx "http://www.gencon.com/2011/indy/sm/eventmarketing/printads.aspx") - Indianapolis, IN August 4-7 (Coupon book or show bag insert; this is a huge investment but thousands of gamers from across the country will see our flyer!)
[Origins Game Fair](http://www.originsgamefair.com/ "http://www.originsgamefair.com/") - Columbus, OH June 22-26 (Another big gaming con I know of. They don't have prices for advertisement up on their site.
If anyone has other ideas, please PM me.
There are banners available for member use on other forums. These images work well when placed in Sigs on relevant sites where other gamers might see them for example. Images are always being uploaded to here: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php")<!-- m -->
The link is also available via the nav bar drop down list under **Resources**
Right now the best and cheapest way to advertise is via word of mouth. The more mouths spreading the news of the site, the more people we will reach. This means the whole community will need to chip in to help with this goal.
I'm also looking for a volunteer or two who can assist me in managing the ads now seen on the site. If managed correctly these could be a good source of income to our site. Since our site is no longer eligible for Google AdSense, which automatically generated ads, I am using a program called Commission Junction. CJ allows the user to specify which ads are placed and applied for, but each ad has to be manually added to the Advertisement mod currently installed (it's not an automatic rotating banner from their site).
The help I need would be simple. The volunteer would look through the vast database, looking for ads from companies which our community may appreciate and would then click on. CJ has the HTML code already available for each ad so it's an easy matter to then add the banner ad to the manager here on the site.
The volunteer would also have to keep an eye on any changes, ie the ad expires. Normally the company will email us, so the volunteer would be given their own site email account for this purpose. I will help the volunteer set up the account so it can be accessed via any email client they currently use.
I would expect this volunteer could spend at least a few hours every week on this project. As compensation the volunteer would have Supporter status for as long as they performed this job.
If there are other ideas out there, please feel free to chip in. This isn't an exclusive list, just ideas I've had.

While I in no way disagree with the above, something just as important as getting new members is getting them to stay and become active. I´m sure some of you others have also noticed that activity on the site seems to have hit some all time low. It isn´t really thrilling for new people to come here and see 3 posts in a week, might discourage a lot from staying and giving it a shot.
Also, I just hate to see the site slow down to glacial speed...
So come one people, we have active games, and open castings...show some activity <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: -->

A flyer has been added to the Link to Us resource page: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/ads.php")<!-- m -->
The pull tab flyer is perfect for posting at game stores. Remember to ask the owner first before posting any flyers.

The **pull-tab flyer** looks nice. I'll see if I can put one up at the library. Thanks! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
