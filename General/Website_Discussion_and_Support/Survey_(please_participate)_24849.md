Please take a few minutes and complete this survey: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/survey.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/survey.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/survey.php")<!-- m -->
The intentions behind it will hopefully set about changes to the community which will be beneficial in the long run and at the very least, see where the interest is within the community.
As an administrator, I am curious to see what it is being done right and what needs to be improved upon to make this a strong, thriving community. Unfortunately, I don't get to communicate with the majority of the community on a day to day basis and so this can be an outlet to put in your opinions.

It's that time of year again.
Please take a few minutes to answer the survey. Even if you've done it recently there are a few changes to it for the new year.
Thanks and Happy New Year!
