# A few oddities

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-24 18:49:14)

Hey, I just thought I should point some things out that have been a bit out of the ordinary for me lately when I visit the site. I had some malware trouble on my computer a week or so back, so I just want to see if it is something on the site, or if maybe something have gotten into my browser.

* I can´t see the "Who´s online" chat window when I´m logged in, though I can when I´m logged out. Could it be a theme thing? I´m using JediKnights.
* Sometimes a small window pops up at the lower right corner, saying something like "Chat Request", kind of like many IM programs does. Is his a feature of the new chat (in which case I´ve been rather rude neglecting a lot of chat requests =P), or some crap in my browser?
* Most recently, there also seems to have been something wrong with my PM box. It currently says I have "0 new messages, -1 unread messages". I´m no expert, but I think it looks like some kind of database error, and I´m worried that it could possibly be keeping me from receiving new PMs.
* Also, when posting messages, some smilies only shoes up as code, not as images. Nothing big, but it could be a sign that something has managed to get into my browser.

Hopefully someone can answer some or all of these questions for me =)

Please include the following and I'll see what I can do.

As for point 2, does this happen when you are logged in or out? The small window is actually a new feature called One2Once chat messaging. It allows users to communicate privately using the chat room, sort of a live PM.
Next time you get it pay attention to who it's from. If it happens to be from "N" then it's a bug and I will need to see about getting it fixed. (Please let me know what page you were viewing and whether you were logged in or not.)

Sorry, forgot we had that template
**Browser:** Firefox, goes for all problems
**Board Style:** Jedi Knights, goes for all problems
**Problem:** Can´t see that "Who´s Online" chat window. I only get a Bluehost 404 error message.
**Steps to replicate problem:** Don´t know
**Browser:** -
**Board Style:** -
**Problem:** Chat Popup window. It seems to come randomly both when I´m online and offline. And yes, it´s from "N", I think. I don´t seem to come at any specific page, but quite randomly.
**Steps to replicate problem:** Just be around the boards.
**Browser:** -
**Board Style:** -
**Problem:** PM box says "0 new messages, -1 unread messages". It appeared a few days ago after I read a PM. I´ve tried removing the latest PM I got, as well as several pages of old one, but nothing happens.
**Steps to replicate problem:** Don´t Know
**Browser:** -
**Board Style:** -
**Problem:** Some smilies shows as code rather than pictures when making posts.
**Steps to replicate problem:** Don´t Know
I did a quick check to see if the problems remained in IE, and all but #4 seems to still be there. Sorry I can´t be more helpful about how to replicate them.

It's alright. I'll switch to using the Jedi Knights template for awhile and see if they occur.
Please standby.

Please verify the issue with the Who's Online for the chat room is now working for you.
Try sending me a PM too while you're at it <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

What pages were you looking at that didn't have functioning smileys?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2011-03-24 19:58:30)

I can see the chat window again, even when logged in.
Test PM sent and response received, and problem disappeared.
All smilies seems to check out, the page I was on was the page where you replies to posts.
I´ll keep an eye out if those popup messages show up again, but thanks for the rest <!-- s:green: -->![:green:](https://i.ibb.co/1tVcFY1d/icon-mrgreen.gif)<!-- s:green: --> Just out of curiosity, what did you do?

Heh.. I'd like to say I did a lot, though really I just changed the code which pointed the Who's online portion to the correct page... As for the PM I figured it would reset itself.

To get clarification on this, you only see the smiley code when you are replying to message threads? Like when you would reply to this message?

Yeah, when replying to this post or any other post, a few of the smilies showed only as code. But it seems to be gone now.
