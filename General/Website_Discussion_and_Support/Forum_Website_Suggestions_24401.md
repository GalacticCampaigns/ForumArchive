Yeah, I´m not too keen on purple lightsabers for the moderators <!-- s:cool: -->![:icon_cool:](https://i.ibb.co/Q79VjkFQ/icon-cool.gif)<!-- s:cool: --> Don´t know what´s available, but if we should vote, I´d throw my vote in for cyan.

I like the purple sabers. Lets me get into my Mace Windu funk on. <!-- s:jedi: -->:<!-- s:jedi: -->

Technically I can make any color I want. And I'm with Yogi, which to be honest is why I chose the purple rank icon.

Crap, you guys are two on one. Where are the others when I need them?

### **zerah** (2009-10-03 02:35:36)

personally I've always loved the purple for the mod lightsabers. Then again I love purple >.>
Edit: Btw, I dunno about anyone else but I think the new royal blue color for the mods is a bit too harsh. It overshadows the admin red and global green, and doesn't seem to have any real form of color syncing. Blue nice, but you have anything that's not so...**blue**

Nice job, Alicia. I really like the purple--it definitely is better than the blue (for the names and sabers).

I will side with you; purple light sabers make my brain hurt. As does a lightsaber with "BMF" on it.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-10-06 12:38:27)

Also, this...is very well done. Love this new site. Kudo to Alica and Rowen and anyone else involved.

Embrace your inner "BMF" Jedi Breeder. You know you want to.

Is there any way to make it so when you post a message that is longer than the input box it doesn't keep bouncing up. I'm using Internet Explorer and when my post is longer every time I hit a key to type it scrolls up to the top of the message and I can't see what I'm typing.
I have since started cutting and pasting so that wont happen but when i want to bold something I can't bold it for the same reason. Anyway to get around that Alicia?
Or is anyone else having that problem?

### **Yogi** (2009-10-06 14:23:28)

IE stinks imo. Firefox is your friend. But I've seen the same thing when I'm forced to use IE.

I rarely use IE. What version are you using so I can attempt to duplicate the problem?

---

### **Rowen** (2009-10-06 15:04:35)

Latest I believe. Internet Explorer 8.

I used IE 8 64-bit and I wasn't experiencing the problem. What keys are you hitting when it bounces up or is it when you are typing in general?

### **Rowen** (2009-10-06 15:31:30)

I'm sure I have the 32bit version since I have Vista 32. Its just when I type, or try to highlight the text. It's probably just a weird bug with this version cause it wasn't doing it before. I did just do an update to serv pak 2.

Ya you would be using 32 bit version. Check your updates again cause sometimes changing service packs has such an effect. Another thing to do if you insist of using IE is to first check to see if there's an install pack for it and then uninstall/reinstall IE. Don't know what else to suggest.

### **Rowen** (2009-10-06 16:52:41)

Thanks Alicia! I thought that is what I would have to do. I wasn't sure if you might know a trick I wasn't aware of though. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

OK, I´m just a novice on handling webpages and stuff, but I have to ask if there is any actual practical reason the site/forum keeps changing looks and appearance?
Because just for the record I think it looked way better like it did earlier today.

---

### **Yogi** (2009-10-06 21:25:45)

You can go back to the other "looks" through the User Control Panel.

### **zerah** (2009-10-06 22:48:02)

I'm with Darth. This is really annoying. I've changed my preference back to the JediKnights theme but now I can't get rid of this side bar thing. What's going on?? It doesn't match and it's bugging me someone help me.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-07 02:28:26)

Now it seems to be back to better

### **Yogi** (2009-10-07 07:57:18)

It will probably change in some form. Alicia wants to make the changes so it's like the main page and it's integrated.
The problem is that the sidebar "scrunches" the forum real bad and makes it look absolutely terrible. I'm hoping that there's some way around it. We just need to be patient as possible as she's dong a good job on trying to make it attractive to potential new members.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-10-07 08:13:26)

Yeah, just wanted to express my opinion that it looked good at the moment, and that unless there was some practical reasons behind it, perhaps it should be left alone.
