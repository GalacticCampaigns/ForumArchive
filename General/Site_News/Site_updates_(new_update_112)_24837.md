<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Please check the latest post for newest updates!</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">New theme</span>:
It will have been noticed that a new default theme was instituted yesterday. I hope you all are liking it. The reason the switch was made was because DivineBlack was not being supported anymore and while I could have updated it to the current version of phpbb3 (which I may still yet do) I felt it more prudent to find an alternate style.
JediKnights is another theme which needs to be drastically updated (it was last updated for v3.0.2 current being v3.0.7, which may not seem much but that's about 2 years or so of updates.) If anyone would like to volunteer in assisting to update DivineBlack or JediKnights. I would be happy to direct you to the necessary files. This would be an extreme help to me and I would be willing to provide one year of [Donator status](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=24542 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=24542") as a reward.

Not much experience is necessary, however being able to find and replace things effectively will be key to successfully updating these files.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">New Member policy:</span>
A policy requiring new members to make a post to the Introduce Yourself forum was instituted. Upon joining all forums are hidden from a new member except a link to a special new member FAQ and the Introduce Yourself forum. At least one post must be made before the board is unlocked.
This policy restricts new members to just the Introduce Yourself forum until they make their first post in that thread, and as the policy only affects the Newly Registered User group, only they will ever be effected. Current members with 0 posts have been included in this group. The policy will hopefully encourage even those who, up till now, have been lurking to at least introduce themselves

JediKnight theme has been completely updated. Some neat features to keep an eye out for are RSS Atom feeds and the quick reply for threads.
Also, missing buttons in the blog section has been added.
Please let me if you find anything which I have missed.

A new default theme has been activated as while the Xtreme theme I had set as the default was a nice addition, I felt the site needed something a bit more neutral as our front page.
As always you can change your theme via the UCP.
DivineBlack is actually next on my list to update and bring back. I'll let you know when that's done.

Portal/Index and Post Models mod was updated.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Board Restructuring</span>:
The Player's and GM's corner for both Star Wars and General RPG disscussion was combined into one forum, "Gamer's Corner", which was further divided into a Star Wars section for better navigation.
The pbp gaming threads have been combined under one category, but still hold their previous divisions. Casting calls for the Star Wars and General Genres are located within the same categories. New Casting Call etiquette will be posted later on.
A new subforum in General Discussions was created making a place for anyone wishing to share their literary works.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Pruning</span>
General Discussions, Site News and Website Discussions was pruned, deleting irrelevant discussions over a year old.
A post to the FAQ was added explaining the board's policy on pruning - <!-- l -->[faq.php#f2r0](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php#f2r0 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php#f2r0")<!-- l -->
