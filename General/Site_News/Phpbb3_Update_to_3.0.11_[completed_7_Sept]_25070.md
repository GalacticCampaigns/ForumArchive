Forum and the default theme has been updated. As I ran out of time and not sure on the compatibility of the other themes (JediKnight and XTreme) I have deactivated them for the time being till I can update them completely. This should happen tomorrow.
I apologize for deactivating the two themes but there were more changes to the theme's coding than I anticipated.
Please stay tuned here and please report any problems using the following:

The board hs been updated to 3.0.11. Due to continued software updates needed for the styles, xTreme theme remains unavailable at this time.
If you wish to assist in updating the themes (xabblue, mobile, JediKnights, xTreme) to the latest version (a process requiring patience, the ability to use find/replace function and can copy/paste) please let me know as any help is appreciated.
