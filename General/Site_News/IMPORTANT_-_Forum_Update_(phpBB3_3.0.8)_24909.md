# IMPORTANT - Forum Update (phpBB3 3.0.8)

### **Alicia** (2010-11-20 15:33:22)

The forum was brought down today for a couple hours around 1pm EST for an update.
The forum was successfully updated to version 3.0.8 RC1.
I'm still working on updating Xtreme style to the latest version which should be done by later today. For those of you who were using it, it has been deactivated in the event there was contradictions in the coding. You will be able to change it back once I have completed the updates to the style.
I now request anyone experiencing troubles with the site follow this procedure and post any problems in this thread:
**Browser:** (Chrome, IE, FireFox, etc)
**Board Style:** (xabbBlue, xtreme, JediKnights, etc. If you don't know the name it's generally listed in the footer.)
**Problem:** (Summary of the problem)
**Steps to replicate problem:** (What did you click on to get the error, where on the site, etc)
Attach a screen shot or paste code error (please put in code box)

```
[b]Browser:[/b]
[b]Board Style:[/b]
[b]Problem:[/b]
[b]Steps to replicate problem:[/b]

```

You can take a screen shot by hitting ALT + print screen. The print screen button comes after F12 on most keyboards. By hitting ALT first you take a screen shot of the active program (your browser in this case).
After you capture the screen shot, open paint. It's found on most Windows OS in Start > Programs > Accessories. With Paint open hit CTRL + V to paste the image. Save the file as a jpg to memorable location and it is ready to upload.
Alternatively, Vista and Windows 7 have a Snipping Tool (just open Start and search for Snipping Tool).

**Browser:** Firefox
**Board Style:** JediKnights
**Problem:** It seems I can´t use any of the code buttons (for bold, italic, etc) when making new posts. Also the "tips" on what tags to use don´t appear when I hover over them, which means it´s hard to add the tags manually as well.
**Steps to replicate problem:** Well, I just tried to make a reply to a post, clicked the buttons, and nothing happened.
I don´t attach a screeshot, since this really wouldn´t show in a screenshot. It doesn´t have to have anything to do with the update, but I haven´t posted since part of the forum was down today (prefer to post at the end of the day), so it´s possible.
EDIT: Problem includes smilies as well

This appears to be a problem with the SubSilver based themes affecting Xtreme and JediKnights. Manually entering BBcode should work for the time being till I can resolve this issue. This issue is not affecting CA Orbital and xabbBlue.
EDIT: Problem has been resolved.

**Browser:** Mozilla Firefox 3.6.13, Chrome 8.0.552.237
**Board Style:** Jedi Knights
**Problem:** In forum index pages where the scrolling add banner shows it covers the drop-down menu. When stepping into threads the banner isn't present so it's not there to block anything.
**Steps to replicate problem:** Using the drop-down menu when the ad banner is present in Mozilla. I was able to duplicate the issue in Chrome but it did not occur when I used IE.

I have not been able to replicate the problem on chrome or mozilla.
