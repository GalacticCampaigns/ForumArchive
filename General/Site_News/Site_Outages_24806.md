# Site Outages

### **Alicia** (2010-09-20 13:49:13)

Some of you may have noticed the site has been frequently going offline the last week. BlueHost, our web hosting provider, instituted an update which appears to have affected their systems. We are not alone in our downtime problems and they claim to be working to solve the problems.
In the meantime, I suggest you copy any posts into notepad till you're sure it went through so any work you've done is not lost. As far as I know it has not effected any posts that have been successfully submitted, but please let me know if you have noticed otherwise.
Thanks for your continued patience and support. Hopefully this will be resolved soon and we can continue normal operations.
