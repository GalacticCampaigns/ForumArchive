The board has been updated to the latest version of phpBB3. If you experience any issues please answer the following:

Problem:
Steps to replicate problem:
Attach a screen shot
You can take a screen shot by hitting ALT + print screen. The print screen button comes after F12 on most keyboards. By hitting ALT first you take a screen shot of the active program (your browser in this case).
After you capture the screen shot, open paint. It's found on most Windows OS in Start > Programs > Accessories. With Paint open hit CTRL + V to paste the image. Save the file as a jpg to memorable location and it is ready to upload.
If you don't have an active username/account on this test site, feel free to use this dummy login:
Username: test
Password: testBoard
You are also welcome to register, though occasionally I will update the user list from the main site.

The bbCode for image alignment (imgal) has been modified. Instead of requiring the user to set a width a predetermined width set by the board settings will be used. If you had used the imgal tag you will need to edit your post and exclude the width.
