It was bound to happen sooner or later and now it has!
A page has been created for our us. With any luck it will help to draw in new potential players and expand our community.[<div style="text-align: left;">

It can also be used to help promote your games and again bring in new players.
If you have a facebook page, feel free to join and take a look!
Likewise if anyone is interested in helping to administer this page (put up recruiting ads for gums who don't have Facebook and other maintenance) please let me know.
