# Banner Ads / Donations - Group:Supporters (update 2 Feb, 12)

### **Alicia** (2010-01-08 15:54:42)

Some of you may realize that there are now ads on the site.
Though I am loathe to introduce such a feature I would like to take a moment to explain why.
The site costs about $100 USD a year for the administrators to maintain. While some of you have been generous enough to donate for the maintenance of the site a good deal is still coming out of the administrators dwindling funds.
I have instituted a new group for such supporters. If you have contributed at least $10 USD via the donate button located throughout the site then you have already been endowed with the following:

* Special rank.
* Larger PM box storage (100 messages per box instead of the normal 50).
* Ad Free.
* Access to the Council Fora

Additionally, supporters are part of the Council. The Council is given the privilege of voicing their opinions and suggestions in a private forum concerning changes and additions to the site.
As time goes on, the donators may receive more special features.

**Donators will have their privileges for one year per $10 USD contributed from the day the payment went through.**
> **Edit:**

> Paypal charges 2.9%+$0.30 per transaction, which means for a $10 donation $0.59 is being deducted. So in reality the site is earning $9.41 with every $10 donation.

## Council Fora

Supporters now have access to the Council Fora.
The Council Fora is a private forum where select members are given the chance to voice their opinions and provide suggestions on changes and the overall future of the site.

As of now, it seems that all income for the site will be generated via the generous donations of our members. I will be placings ads for our affiliates in the place of AdSense.
If anyone has any recommendations in how we may generate revenue for the site, please don't hesitate to voice your opinion.

I have found an affiliate program called Commision Junction which will allow the same sort of set up in ads we were getting with Google AdSense. Using CJ gives me more control over what ads are seen on the site, so there won't be any more inappropriate ads popping up.
The downside is I have to manually go into our new Advertisement Manager mod to add the ads to the site. Again I'm always looking for volunteers to help, which might even earn you Supporter status.

Unfortunately, we have run into the same problem with Commission Junction as we did with AdSense. Our site wasn't creating enough revenue for them to make it worth while for us to continue having an account. As such they closed it.
Until another option arises, our community will have to rely on the generosity of its member base.
This year is particularly important as this is the year the site will be renewing it's hosting. While many of you have been generous over the last three years that I've been Administrator (has it really been that long?) we are $137.48 short of the amount we need. Our three year contract costs $386.40 and while I can pick up some of the slack I'm not sure if I can pick up the remaining.
Please consider donating! Keep in mind Paypal takes out a percentage of each donation (I guess they have to be paid too)
