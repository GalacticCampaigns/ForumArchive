Welcome to the Galactic Campaigns.
We are glad you are with us and hope you stay with what is destined to be a great community. However with every great community there has to be some rules. We assume that if you can use the internet, you know the basics of social interaction, so please remember them. But just in case these guidelines should cover what is acceptable and what is not.
Please review our Site Rules / Code of Conduct <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> <!-- l -->[rules.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/rules.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/rules.php")<!-- l -->
Thank you for your time,
Rowen Darkstar - Site Founder
