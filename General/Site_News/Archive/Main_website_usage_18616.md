# Main website usage

### **Rowen** (2008-10-03 12:28:02)

The main website of Galactic Campaigns was created to draw more attention to the site and allow a collaborative joining of fans for Saga edition to create and share their work. However, after almost 4 months of being up and countless attempts to advertise it seems there really isn't much interest.
Its saddens me when you spend so much work on something and you think the fan base will love it, only to find out no one cares enough to contribute or participate. My goal was to create an interactive site, where members could do more than just play by post. I introduced the Kalium galaxy **AGAIN**, and interest picked up for a little bit but its an all but dead project. There have been two submissions since the start of the site, one from Alicia and another from MoDaVader, I thank you both. This however, isn't enough, two submission in 4 months.....every time I log into the admin section to see if there is content I can approve I get an empty box.
I've made the decision to take the main site down, it wasn't something I was prepared to do. Every time I thought of writing this I always said, 'Give it one more month'. My delusions of having a busy, bustling site with tons of submissions just won't happen, at least not in its current state. The forums will, as always, remain.
Again, while nothing will stop me from hitting the delete key on that project, I am open to suggestions (which I usually ask every time I get my creative juices flowing!) on what you, as members, want.
If I sound frustrated or angry I apologize. I'm passionate about the things I do and when they fall threw I can't help but vent and throw my hands up in frustration. I truly thought that site would take off. Perhaps Im just out of touch with what the pen and paper RPG community wants.
For now, enjoy the forum.....keep those awesome games going that I pop in to read! and have fun!

Hey Rowen <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
I understand your passion; we all have it at varying levels. I like the main site idea (and wish I had more time to add to it <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( --> ) You could leave it open for a while ... forget about it and see if it surprise you. Though that may not happen, many members continue to add to the Kalium galaxy idea it may live yet.

I like the site. When I first heard about it, I was super-excited. I still am.
I would have made more contributions by now, except for my jury service the last few weeks, as I've had to concentrate on that. Even with it, I've managed to work on a planet and an organization (and a Force talent tree for it), and was going to post them to the forums today, now that the trial has ended. I know I'm one of the few who's contributed, but I'd like it to stay up.
I have noticed a lack of excitement in some areas. It's disappointing, because the Kalium Galaxy is the main reason I contribute to this site. I'd really love to see it stay open.

Rowen! Don't take it down!
I know someone that owns 3000 domains and it takes time to generate hits. Most people on this site are players. We have a lot of GM's, and I know there is a lot of ideas floating out there, but it takes time to put up quality ideas. Saga isn't D&D there are not nearly as many people playing and contributing. Since its a freelance writing people will write at there own pace, if they were getting paid to add content then that would be different.
Fresh new content is hard to come by, and I think by you taking down the site it doesn't allow the opportunity to contribute.
I own my domain, and if I had a website like you have I could host it for free. It doesn't cost me anything. I hope its not a money thing, because if its free to have it up keep it up.
By leaving the site up you create the Opportunity, when you find someone that is prepared to contribute then you give them the opportunity. If you take down the site, then all your work and your vision and ideas are gone. I think the longer you keep it up, the better chance you have of it taking off. I mean I don't think I found Galactic Campaigns until at least a year you were up. Unless you have some serious social networking going, its going to be hard to get the word out.
Don't take it down, please. Its a wonderful homepage. I love it. I think you did an awesome job. I'm learning how to web build and use Joomla! and I thought you did an awesome job. It hasn't gone unoticed, and I want you to know that I appreciate the homepage. Its professional and fun at the same time.

Greetings sir. I'm a new guy to this site and its message boards but I have "met" you over on the WotC boards. I recently found this site and I like it very much. I am joining what appears to be a growing chorus asking you to keep all elements of this site active.
The main site is well designed and very professional looking. It serves as a great front cover to this project of yours and sets it apart from a mere message board-based fanboy gush and rant. Please keep it up and running. There may be a low amount of contribution through it by site members but I don't think it is an indication of lack of interest. As the president of a local RPG club and secretary in a regional miniatures organization, I know full-well that most gamers simply have a lack of time to participate in all of the hobby-related things in which they want to be active. Don't take that unfortunate reality as a lack of interest in your project and don't overreact by undoing so much of what you have accomplished.
Let the site live Rowen. Don't think about it and let it live on its own for a time. And remember, as the Buddists and Jedi say, "Desire leads to suffering; suffering leads to pain; pain leads to anger; anger leads to the Dark Side."
Peace to you.
PS -- I like the Jedi-styled color theme on this board but it keeps me from posting in purple! That's as much a part of my online presence as my screen name and signature. (I'll live though; it's okay. : )

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-04 09:08:13)

I too would like to ask you to keep it up a little longer Rowen. I have things thatÂ´ll be ready to submit soon, itÂ´s just that I also work on a couple of other homemade projects, and other things that keeps me busy.

### **ganthet** (2008-10-07 14:39:49)

I guess i have to say with the rest of them that I would like to see this site stay up and running. I look forward to it everyday I get up this is the only place I can get good solid roleplaying and ask question without being treated like I am some kind of moron. Wizards site is not a friendly sometimes and the people think they are elite gamers or something. Oh well I have put in my two cents. So it is up to you on this one Boss. Ganthet out.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-10-09 01:01:16)

Hey, hey, hey, let's not be too hasty. I like the main site, and though I haven't gotten around to posting a lot with it, I want to. I have a lot of work put into stuff. Leave it up if you don't mind.
And Kalium is far from a dead project, I think. Me, **MoDaVader**, **DarthAnthrax**, **SacredPhoenix**, **Thraken**, **ganthet**, **Rebaav**, **master_Tru** and others have been hitting it pretty hard. But we're still knocking most ideas around, and only want to put stuff tot he main site after it's been shined, polished, and all shiny.
...that, and, uh, I haven't read up on how to post things to the main site...

### **Rowen** (2008-10-09 15:56:01)

Okay, okay, Ill leave the main site up for a while longer and see what happens. The website will be in good standing until September 2010, member donations guaranteed that. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> I won't have to hold another open donation until 2010 and Ill see what the status of the site is then.
As for submitting articles, characters, or news to the main site. Just log in and click the appropriate link to submit the content your created. You will need to have author status but I generally give that to everyone once I see they registered. You won't see your article right away either, I still have to approve the content of the submission. This keeps spammers from submitting inappropriate content. Have your submission format match that of the rule books and you shouldn't have a problem with content getting approved.
I hope to see more activity on that site, there are tons of addons I can install to Joomla. If you know of a current one let me know and Ill see what I can do to add it.
Thank you all,
Rowen

Woo-hooo! Thank you.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-12 09:46:07)

On this topic, I would like to raise a question of how we are to handle submitting content. One reason I (and I suppose many others as well) havenÂ´t submitted anything, is that we have put it up for discussion here on the forums first.
But I checked the main website today, and I saw that of two things submitted, there was one that I had never seen before. Personally I feel that it would have been nice if it had passed through the forums first, since I have a thing or two IÂ´d like to say about the stat sheet. I also thought that was why we appointed a few moderators for the Kalium Galaxy, that we were to help decide what was to be added. That people would put things on the board for duscussion here, and that when it seemed the discussion was ended, weÂ´d be the ones who submitted it.
Thoughts???

### **Rowen** (2008-10-12 21:00:20)

The forums are always open for those that would like to submit content for peer review. With the new main site anyone can submit content, even if they are not a member of the forums. The idea was to allow more people to participate and get a huge influx of content......it didn't work.
If you will notice there are several sections you cannot submit content for. Those sections will be the 'Cannon' material for the Kalium galaxy. Anything else submitted is out there for anyone to use and is not 'official' until it is moved to that section. Upon looking those subcategories are not visible, so there are a few things you can't see yet.
There is a voting option for each and every submitted piece of content. Its there for a reason. If you like the material then vote for it, giving it a rating from 1-5, with five being the best. The content that has the highest rating will be the first considered to be added to the 'cannon' section of the Kalium Galaxy, thus creating content.
While the forums are here they are for those that frequent the forums and when making the Main site I decided it would be best to let anyone submit content with out first going threw the forums. I thought more people would submit content that way.
Anyway, I hope you guys continue to make great content and have fun!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-13 03:45:12)

Hmm, I can only find 1 category that I canÂ´t submit things to.
My personal opinion is that I would like to see things go through the forums first, before it being submitted, if only just to check everything for consistency. Becase I think that the things we put up on the website should at least be correct in terms of rules, and preferrably have some unison format. And now IÂ´m looking at things that donÂ´t and I can do nothing about it.
Just my opinion.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-10-13 09:31:23)

If I were to restrict things to the forums first and then the main site I don't think as many people would participate. I could be wrong though. I'm not apposed to the idea however.
*Other than the Hutts and the Star ship what has been submitted that isn't correct in terms of rules? and how isn't it correct. I'm no rules police so I don't notice things like this.*
As for uniformity, if they don't follow the submission guidelines then it doesn't get approved as far as format is concerned. Also, policing every piece of content could (and this is just an opinion) turn would-be content submitters away because they think there content might not be 'good enough'. Or fear that people might turn it into something its not because its not what *they* (meaning the critique'ers) think it should be.
While that can help the creative process it also can hamper it and slow it down. Remember anything submitted can be changed by those that submit the article, if they realize its to powerful or out of balance they can always edit it.
I'm open to more critiques and idea's on how to handle this.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-13 09:49:19)

Well, what I was thinking about was the submitted starship, I seem to find a few things that donÂ´t go together in the stats. As a few examples I can mention the following:

* It says to have "SR 55+15 for additional shields". Is there some rule on having more than one shield generator somewhere?
* It says that it has replaced the Sublight 1 drive with a Sublight 4 drive, but the stat block still has 1 square as speed.
* The Reflex Defense is wrong, since the increased Dex only adds +2, and also, I would have preferred to write "Dex 18) rather than "Dex 14(+4 Maneuvering Thrusters".
* The improved Dex should also have improved Pilot and Initiative checks.
* It states that 65 tons of cargo space has been removed, but the original ship has 75 tons, and this one has 15. 75-65 /= 15.
* It has the CEC manufacturing template. Sure something like the CEC might exist in the Kalium Galaxy, but still. Also, can someone tell me where to find that template, I canÂ´t seem to find it.
* Some of the attack bonuses seems off.

I know these things are small things (mostly), and that some of them comes from the weird habit of not using their own rules when making the statblock from SotG, but such things would all have been found and removed if other people could have had a look on it as well. I would be more than happy to help with such things if needed.
Also, you could offer up constructive criticism on how to improve it, as well. If this had come up for discussion, IÂ´d probably pointed out that he could gain +1 EP from removing the original SR 15, and suggested that a Jamming Suite was installed.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-13 12:29:02)

I agree with both of you. While I think the site should be open to submissions from anybody, just to increase the number of submissions, we'll have to pay for it occasionally with content like the Hufdren Hammer.
I'm no expert on ship stat blocks, but why is the Hufdren Hammer (a modified Gozanti Cruiser) listed as a starfighter? The description also got me. I'm a writer, so maybe I'm just more sensitive, but the grammar is horrible and makes the reading difficult. Here's the first sentence:
> During an attempt to find a suitable location for a base of operations, this would be the second base since the first was absconded by a much stronger pirate band, Arewseld &quot;Lucky&quot; Hufdren stumbled upon a secret and long forgotten shipyard.

I can't be the only one who has a problem with this. For one thing, unless the stronger pirates ran away with the first base in tow, they can't abscond with it. Two, it should read:
> After his first base was captured by a stronger pirate band, Arewseld &quot;Lucky&quot; Hufdren set out to find a new base of operations and stumbled upon a secret and long forgotten shipyard.

Heck, that's not even that good, but it's acceptable. Now I know that not everyone is a writer, but it does have to be readable.

### **Rowen** (2008-10-13 13:23:30)

I see what you mean know that you point it out. Like I said, I've never been good with the numbers. Maybe its because I don't get to use the rules that much or make that many characters or NPC's. Its always been a weak area for me, and I've often be envious of those that can spot stuff like that just by looking it over.
I understand what you mean about fleshing out the content and having everything go thru the forums isn't a bad idea. Its just to bad that I can't link the forum and site together in some way (other than adding a forum mod to the main site).

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-13 13:45:26)

Like I said, I am happy to help with such things (checking numbers etc), since I feel I have a pretty good grip on it. I can typically sit down and stat out an NPC just for fun. In fact, thatÂ´s what I thought you wanted me to do when you asked if I wanted to be a moderator of the Kalium Galaxy Forum.
Like you said, it can be both good and bad to have everything go through the forums, but in my opinion, I think the good will outweigh the bad. I know that IÂ´ll probably post everything IÂ´m thinking of submitting here first, since there are a lot of people here with good opinions.
Just to make it clear, I am not critizising any of the material submitted, I just think that it can be so much enchanted just by having someone look it over (if only just to clear out minor spelling or calculation errors) and possibly can be expanded into more of the creatorÂ´s intent by discussion with the others.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-10-13 14:12:15)

I see your point and I believe your right that in the long run better content will come from the critiquing process. I have a rather crazy schedule right now and will work on changing the submission guidelines as soon as I can. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Thanks for all the help guys.

I know I haven't added anything to the new galaxy you all are working on but when I saw the stats and the write up of the starship in question I did a double take and thought, "**W**hisky, **T**ango, **F**oxtrot, over."
Maybe the shields of 55 +15 means the starship designer feat was used to add 15 more. If so the cost of the ship is now out of wack as adding +15 shields that was costs an extra 225k in credits.

My thought is simply that the SR 15 is a leftover from what the ship had for starters, and I suppose that you could maybe have more than 1 shield generator aboard (to be used separately), but I think it should have been noted in a different way.
