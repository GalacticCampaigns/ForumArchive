# Site Ranks and Smilies

### **Rowen** (2008-08-20 18:37:16)

To avoid any confusion I would like to clarify what the site ranks are. Those of you that have been with SWGC for a while, back when it was the SWGA probably remember the ranks. So for those of you not familiar Ill fill you in.
Their are Fourteen different ranks that you can obtain. Getting them is simple, just be active on the forms and your post counts will earn you these ranks. As you climb the rank ladder you will start to assemble your Lightsaber, starting with the hilt. As your post count climbs your saber blade will begin to show and eventually will become a full Lightsaber.
The Ranks are as follows (The number beside the title are the posts needed to obtain that rank):
1. Fringer 0
2. Scoundrel 20
3. Scout 50
4. Soldier 100
5. Noble 200
6. Ace Pilot 400
7. Bounty Hunter 800
8. Gunslinger 1600
9. Officer 2400
10. Melee Duelist 4000
11. Force Adept 5000
12. Force Disciple 6000
13. Jedi Knight 7500
14. Jedi Master 10000
Some of you might be saying thats a LOT of posts for the later ranks. But to be a Master you have to train! :
Oh and we have new Smilies, here they are:

Enjoy!

visto, I'm going to make a new topic in my forum, let's move the war there. :

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-08-20 20:19:59)

All is good, until I reached these lines:
> &#8230;11. Force Adept 5000
> 12. Force Disciple 6000
> 13. Jedi Knight 7500
> 14. Jedi Master 10000&#8230;

I am, as a matter of course, offended. And shall be quite verbose in my objections, should I ever be maliciously assigned such a rank.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-08-20 20:23:44)

Breeder will now cut back on his post and will never wish to gain the rank of the filthy Jedi :

---

### **zerah** (2008-08-22 12:33:43)

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-03 20:50:58)

Rowen where do you find smiles like : :04 : : : that are related to star wars and what not?

---

### **Rowen** (2008-09-04 20:52:45)

I just google searched 'star wars smilies' and found all those lol.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-04 21:26:01)

There very interesting

---

### **chibiamy** (2008-10-01 15:21:12)

Rowen, question ...
Can I still get a pink lightsaber?
*duck*
I like the new smilies.
Hopefully I'll get the chance to check in here more often. *flail*

I wish I could assign a special lightsaber to some members, but I would have to make special ranks to do that and it wouldn't be something automatic. Perhaps for mods or something.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-10 22:33:56)

I have reduced the amount of posts it takes to get a full lightsaber. I have also omitted pictorial ranks until members reach 300+ posts. So some of you may notice your forum rank icon is a touch different than on the old forum.
Another interesting feature I found was the addition of special ranks. I can assign ranks and hand them to members, something I wasn't able to do before. So those of you that donated during the last donation drive could be getting a SWGC Donator ranks. The possibilities are endless hehe.

### **Yogi** (2008-11-11 07:53:37)

I think there are still some bugs. There are some (MoDaVader ~140 posts) who has almost a full lightsaber and I ~470 posts who only has a lightsaber hilt. No big deal but I just wanted to let you know.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 08:41:27)

Yeah I'm not so sure why it does that. I've tried to isolate the problem but with no luck. It seems to happen if someone of a lower rank posts after someone with a higher rank, at least the times I have seen it.
Ill keep checking on it though.

---

### **Anazider** (2008-11-11 09:32:54)

There is also something where it looks like the same person is logged in multiple times along the top menu bar in the "Viewing" section.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 10:03:39)

That I have no control over, Im not sure why it does that really. The bottom list is far more accurate.

You know, I noticed that. I couldn't figure out why my lightsaber was nearly complete, while others were barely there.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 10:57:30)

And for some reason you have the admin title and lightsaber......very odd....very odd indeed.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 11:04:13)

Ill look into it further but it may come down to removing the forum ranks. I even disabled the Admin/Moderator ranks and the ranks still display incorrectly on members that should have no rank icon.
Its not something vital at least was just nice to have.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 23:58:37)

i noticed some people that had only 2 posts, yet had the melee duelist rank and a full lightsaber

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-12 06:58:49)

You have only 1200 and some posts, and have the same despite the fact that the forum indictates 400 posts. I think I have the rank as well, even though I have somewhere near 400 posts.

---

### **Yogi** (2008-11-12 07:02:43)

Posting to see what mine is.
Yup 170 more than you Bob and all I have is the hilt. lol
Oh well. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-12 07:07:07)

Checking to see if mine's changed.
Something I noticed, a LOT of people seem to have the Melee Duelist title.
EDIT: Mine seems to have changed.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-12 11:09:10)

This beats all I have ever seen. When the default ranks were being used there everything showed correctly. Perhaps this wasn't designed to and new ranks. I'm at a loss.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-12 17:14:58)

It looks as tho we're back to normal.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-11-13 08:03:40)

The site rank images and titles themselves still appear to be bugged. I have taken them down until I can find a solution to the problem.

---

### **Yogi** (2008-11-13 08:07:15)

No worries Rowen. Tackle it when you can.
