Welcome to the new and improved Star Wars Galactic Campaigns! For those that may not know the original site started on May 22, 2007 just before the release of Saga edition. At that time it was called Star Wars Galactic Adventures.
Since then the site has maintained a steady core member base and has grown to 100+ members. Frequent down times and forum mishaps started us looking for other means of hosting the site. With member approval a donation program was started which lead to us finally purchasing this site.
The site is hardly finished, although the core forums are present it still lacks the spit and polish that I want it to have. Small changes will be made over the course of several months adding small features here and there.
I hope you enjoy your time with us.

Surely the ball *is* rolling? Everything but the games can make the switch over right now!
