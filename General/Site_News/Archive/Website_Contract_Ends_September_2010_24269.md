# Website Contract Ends September 2010

### **Rowen** (2009-07-06 19:31:03)

This site has been paid in full by myself and members for the last two years and will have been in service for three years in September 2010. We have had an amazing time and some scary instances with database corruption and the site getting closed down for excessive scripting issues. I have for the last month been researching other companies and what they can offer for a similar pricing. The sad truth is that no company offers a shared server with no CPU usage limits and our site just skirts on the edge of those boundaries with just a forum.
To let you know more let me give you some numbers. Right now there is an hourly and Daily execution limit on the site (that's the number of scripts executed). Our numbers for just today are:
Hourly: 1269/800 (We have gone over)
Daily: 8689/12000 (We are in the orange and are dangerously close to exceeding the limit here)
Our CPU usage has been fine but also titers on the edge, here are the numbers for that:
Hourly: 464.28/1000 (In the yellow here)
Daily: 3300.25/10800 (Just entering the yellow)
Not to bad but the executions alone could cause the site to shut down again.
Now for site statistics for June:
Unique Visitors: 1414
Hits: 657255
Bandwidth used: 7.72 GB
As you can see we have quite a few visitors and lots that just come to read the forums Im guessing cause we sure don't have 1k members.
All the trouble with the site hosts has left a bitter taste in my mouth. Its been fun to run a website that has become as popular as Galactic Campaigns and I have set a record for sticking with this one hobby for so long. After **September 2010** rolls around Galactic Campaigns will be no more. I am not renewing the contract with Site Ground.
I have reopened the original site that has all the adds on it. Most of you old timers might remember Galactic Adventures. We can move there before the sites deadline and continue our gaming there for free. We will just have to put up with the adds. I have made my mind up and this is unfortunately final. I can not transfer the site to anyone but if anyone wants they can pick up the domain once it expires.
Its been great being your Administrator and most importantly its been great becoming friends with all of you. I hope each and everyone of you finds your way to Galactic Adventures so that our tight knit group can stay together.

Are we going to be able to move all our data to the GA?

I don't think so, but I will check.

Fine, let's move. I have no problem with ignoring ads. Rowen, I had no idea that y'all were paying for this. Screw that and let's move.

I put in a ticket with the old site to see if it is even possible to move this database to there so we don't loose the members or posts. However I am skeptical about it. I have thought of several other alternatives since posting this announcement.
I could find other free forum providers, and see which is the best. Most free forums do offer ad removal for a fee, similar to what this site costs now but members can donate directly to the site and not my paypal account. They also have no limits on bandwidth or members. In essence it could very well be a great move.
I am thinking of at least keeping the domain name and I can use that for the free forum.
Those are my options. We most likely will lose what we have here but will game a permanent set up with what ever free forum host we go for. This way if member choose to donate for ad's that's all well and good but not required.
Let me know what you think.

I lose intenet for THREE DAYS, and you see what happens? Can you imagine what happens if was gone for the whole year?
I am cool with whatever happens, as long as I get to keep showing up here. Where ever 'here' is. This place has good people, and the tolerate me.
Plus, the Kalium Galaxy over there has some of my old stuff.

The old site was and is annoying with the ads yet I think the majority of us would deal with the ads to keep such a great site going. Lets not lose sight of everything we have accomplished and what stories we have yet to tell and experience. Once we move to the other site this community will continue to enjoy great gaming. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **simplyscribed** (2009-07-07 10:17:26)

I think this is a smart decision, Rowen. The community has become too big for us to coast along financially but it's not big enough that we can sensibly rely on donations. Moving to a free forum, even if we pay a little to remove ads at a fixed price, solves the issues of financing the community in one swoop.
In the instance that we can't transfer the information, we have more than enough advance warning to make our own backups of the information we want to keep, even if it's as inelegant as a copy/paste job.

### **Alicia** (2009-07-07 11:30:09)

Rowen, if they are using the latest version of phpbb3 and you have access to the ACP like normal then you should be able to go through the maintenance tab and "restore" the database. That's something to look into as well.

---

### **Rowen** (2009-07-07 13:08:29)

Simply you are right, people can back up ther information and post it in the appropriate forums on the old (new?) site lol. Or on any good free forum we decide to use.
Alicia, they have that stuff blocked off. Yes it is phpBB3 but they change some of the code to block non-paying forum users from accessing database backup and restore features.

---

### **Alicia** (2009-07-07 13:28:14)

well.. I wouldn't mind putting money forward to not pay for ads and for you to have such features.
How much are we talking about?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-07-07 14:17:04)

ThatÂ´s rough.
But as long as weÂ´re not shutting the site down, and we remain in play, IÂ´m good. Just hope I can get my own internet connection back soon.

### **Rowen** (2009-07-07 17:21:30)

I'll check on free forum hosts over the next week or so. I believe the free forum that Galactic Adventures uses is around 80 a year if you want ad free. I can ad a donate link as a option on it (I think) so it makes it easier for member donations and once you hit the mark for ad free it automatically uses it.
Ill look around, yes we have the old site but I would like to keep Galactic Campaigns in stead of Galactic Adventures.

### **Yogi** (2009-07-07 19:28:43)

I haven't checked yet but I have a gamer friend that runs his own Website Development & Hosting company that I plan to chat up today/tonight. Ro I'll give him the stats you posted in the first post and see what he thinks and what he would cost. I can't promise anything but I can try.
Here's the link for his site.

You might consider getting growth estimates from Rowan as well, if she has them. I'd hate for us to have this discussion again in Dec just cause we grew some more. Ideally, the hosting site would allow us to pay as we grow.

I found a free forum provider that has our template design. I have made the forum (I have not populated it with categories and sub-categories yet). I'll post the link here for everyone to check out. Seems fast and responsive.
No you can't use a previous database it would be starting from scratch. I think if this site is to everyones liking we should start to slowly make the move over so that were in position before this site expires. Possibly starting only new games there and picking up any continued games (new chapters) there as well. That way we will be in position and have a firm foot hold there before this site poofs.

### **Alicia** (2009-07-22 11:05:44)

Are we going to be able to change the images in the banner? IIRC in the normal template manager on the ACP you can change the php code, if possible we could re-source the banner images to another site.
It's too bad they don't allow to to import databases.

---

### **Rowen** (2009-07-22 16:28:42)

I'll check on the banners. I'm pretty sure Ill be able to edit that part if nothing else.

### **Anonymous** (2009-07-28 11:32:32)

Hey, just curious, whenabouts is the new site going to be ready for posting. No hurry, I just want to know the soonest I can move a game over there.

### **Rowen** (2009-07-28 20:32:18)

With in the next several months. I'm padding myself here. Could be done lots sooner.
