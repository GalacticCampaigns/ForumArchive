# Feature - Chat (ProChatRooms v6)

### **Alicia** (2009-12-05 13:20:01)

I'm pleased to inform you that we have switched to a new chat room. While there are still some kinks to deal with I'm very pleased with this product and hope the rest of you will enjoy it as well. The chat is now member exclusive and you must be logged into the site/forum to use it.
Those of you who made the previous chat room bookmarked I regret to inform you that those bookmarks will no longer work and furthermore the new chat can not be bookmarked (as of yet). Instead you will have to access the chat via the site once you are logged in.
As some may have noticed, a "who's online" list for the chat has been added to the bottom of the forum so everyone will know when there are others in the chat.
If needed here is the help file for the chat.
[http://galacticcampaigns.com/prochatrooms/help/index.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/prochatrooms/help/index.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/prochatrooms/help/index.php")
Features of the chat being worked out.

* When logging into the chat from Joomla the profiles don't link to the forum profiles properly. (Joomla no longer used)
* Default text color is black.
* GC related avatars.(Forum avatars loaded on chat login)

SOLVED
If there are other changes you would like to see, please let me know.

Chat room was updated to the latest version today. All chat user data was deleted to allow integrations with the forum's profile pages.
If you had set up an avatar in the chat, this will have to be redone.
Let me know if you run across any problems.

Avatars for the chat are now loaded from the forum. The avatar you use on the forum will be transferred to the chat.
Your avatar can be changed through the UCP > profile menu <!-- l -->[ucp.php?i=profile&amp;mode=avatar](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/ucp.php?i=profile&mode=avatar "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/ucp.php?i=profile&mode=avatar")<!-- l -->
Let me know if you have any issues.
