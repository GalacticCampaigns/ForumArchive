# Group: Game Masters

### **Alicia** (2010-10-26 17:55:10)

A new group for Game Masters has been specially created to help recognize those who have dedicate their time in running campaigns within our community. [Group Description and members](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=group&g=36 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=group&g=36")
These members get a special rank, additional storage space in their PM boxes (75 PMs per folder), and access to an exclusive forum just for Game Masters.
Members may request to join the group and will be accepted based on set standards. GMs currently running games will eventually be included in this group by default, but please feel free to request to join to aid the group leaders in including you in the group.
**Requests to join are done through the User Control Panel (UCP).**
Under the Options column, click "User Groups".
Fill the bullet next to the "Game Master" group.
Near the bottom in a drop down menu, select "Join Selected" and click Submit.
The group leaders will then process your request and you will receive an email when it has been completed.
Through the same panel, **a member may choose which group is set as their default.** The group determines what displays as your title, but **will not** affect your permissions.
Bullet the group you want to become your default.
Click the button near the bottom: "Change default group"
