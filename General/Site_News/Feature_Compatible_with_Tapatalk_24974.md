Tapatalk forum software has been updated to 3.4.2 which has implemented Push notifications via the app.
Now when you receive a PM, update to bookmarked and subscribed thread you will receive notifications on your devices!
Additionally, spoilers and dice rolls are displaying correctly in threads, however, submitting dice rolls through tapatalk will not 'roll' correctly until resubmitted via the browser.
