Are you getting an affiliate fee for Tapatalk?

Right now ads are not set up, but I would like to down the line once we get a presence on there.
Not to mention it's a great app for forum browsing and is fully supported by our site.

Tbh, I can't be bothered to hash out a long post on my phone, it works great on a tablet though. You just need to remember all the bb codes <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

TT4 is the tablet version. If you purchased HD in the past it's been renamed to this version.
I like it even for casual viewing on my phone, though I'm used to writing posts using google drive and then transferring it over when it's done.

Agreed, reading posts or PMs it's good for.
Posts can wait until I'm on a decent sized screen though.
