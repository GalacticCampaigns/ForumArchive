Bluehost, the community's web host provider will be transferring the server for our site to a new location. An expected outage between 9 PM, March 24th and 5 AM March 25th (MDT) will occur lasting no more than 1 to 3 hours.
Here's the email should you wish for more details:
> Dear Bluehost Customer,
> Bluehost has completed construction on our new data center expansion, complete with advanced temperature control, custom server racks and dozens of improvements designed to help us provide you with higher quality service. We will be moving all customer servers into the new center over the next few weeks.
> This expansion allows us to continue to manage all hardware alongside our Technical Support team and System Administrators, here in Provo, Utah. Our experience has shown that hands-on control over all aspects of your hosting is the best method of ensuring excellence.
> The Bluehost System Administrators will physically move your server into the new data center between 9 PM, March 24th and 5 AM March 25th (MDT), during low traffic periods. We will work to ensure you experience as little downtime as possible and, to that end, we will take the opportunity to perform any needed hardware maintenance or upgrades. We expect the process to take 1 to 3 hours.
> These changes are a reflection of Bluehost&#39;s continued drive toward security, stability and reliability. If you have any questions, our world-class support representatives will be happy to help. Just call us anytime, toll-free at (888) 401-4678.
