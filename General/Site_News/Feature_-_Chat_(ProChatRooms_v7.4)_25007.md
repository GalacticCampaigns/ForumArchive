# Feature - Chat (ProChatRooms v7.4)

### **Alicia** (2011-03-25 11:29:13)

ProChatRooms v7 is an upgrade from the previous version of the chat we had been using up until the beginning of March.
This new version will prove to be more stable than its predecessor and will utilize less web hosting backend but more of the user's browser. Using inline divs, the issue with popups being blocked will no longer be an issue.
Some noticeable changes:
**One2One private chat** allows members to request a live chat through another user's profile. Think of it as a live PM. Links to request the chat will be available on the profile page should the user be online. A small window will appear to the bottom right of the screen informing the user of the request.
As far as I have seen the requester needs to remain on the same page till his request has been accepted or declined.
**Share images/files** may not be a new feature to our chat room experience the fact that at present only .jpg, .gif, .zip, .txt, and .pdf may be shared is.
**BBCode** has been enabled allowing for italics, bold and underline to be used. Text will also be displayed as typed allowing for paragraph breaks from copied text.
**Roll modifiers** is included now and two dice commands are available for use.
/dice and /roll will work equally. A space must be placed between the *ndn* command and the modifier.
ie. /roll 1d20 +3 ( Result: 19, 3 Total: 22 )
/dice 1d20 -3 ( Result: 11, -3 Total: 8 )
As of right now, the command will only perform addition and subtraction as shown above.
Features to be included in the near future:

Template based on user theme
Imported User avatars from forum
Specialized mobile interface
If there is anything you would like to see, please let me know.
