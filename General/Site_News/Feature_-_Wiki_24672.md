# Feature - Wiki

### **Alicia** (2010-05-27 19:11:51)

I pleased to annouce the re-integration of a wiki to the site.
Because we are no longer using Joomla I went in search of an easy to use wiki we could use for a variety of uses and have login integrated with our forum. MediaWiki seemed to supply our need as it's a basic wiki site used by all the big names we're familiar with.
The wiki will house campaign information, character sheets and the Kalium Galaxy!
Feel free to post any of your characters up on there. A category will be established for them soon for submissions.
If you had pages on our previous wiki here is the backup information.

Support for this feature has been discontinued due to lack of interest.
