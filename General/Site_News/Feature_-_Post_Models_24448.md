# Feature - Post Models

### **Alicia** (2009-10-19 13:45:47)

I'm glad to introduce a new feature to the forum, which I hope you all will find very useful. This feature is the ability to add pre-formated text to a post and even to PMs.
Right now the models I have set up are for Star Wars Saga character and vehicle sheets.
To insert the text you reply or post a new topic. Under the "subject" line you have the option to insert the post Model. In the post body choose where you want the model to be inserted, choose the model and click the insert button. You can then edit the information into the post body.
If there are other models you feel should be made available to the forum community please PM me and include the model in the code tags. Also, if you notice the post model is not available for your theme, please send me a PM with the name of the theme in use. This feature has to be added manually to each theme for it to be usable by everyone.

Sounds awesome. Now I need to find something to use it for so I can test it out . . .

This has been updated to the latest version.
Supposedly I can control which forums certain models are used on, but I haven't seen much differences. Please let me know if this isn't the case.
