# Feature - User Blogs ~* Now Implemented *~

### **Alicia** (2010-05-08 00:23:25)

I hope everyone had an opportunity to check out the testing of the blog. If not, you should discover that this feature has been implemented into the live site. Categories for Blog posts have been created to what I believe will be needed in the near future. If there's a category you wish expanded on or created, please don't hesitate to request it here.
**Blog Features being worked on:**
Custom buttons for styles
Post Models
Mobile version
If you are registering any errors please post any difficulties using the following:

```

[b]Browser:[/b]
[b]Style:[/b]
[b]Problem:[/b]
[b]Steps to duplicate[/b]
```

Attach a screen shot.
(You can take a screen shot by hitting ALT + print screen. The print screen button comes after F12 on most keyboards. By hitting ALT first you take a screen shot of the active program (your browser in this case).
After you capture the screen shot, open paint. It's found on most Windows OS in Start > Programs > Accessories. With Paint open hit CTRL + V to paste the image. Save the file as a jpg to memorable location and it is ready to upload.
Vista and W7 have a program called "Snipping Tool" found in "Accessories" which can be used to create screenshots and save them to location of choice.)

Has anyone tried using this feature or taken a look at it? Wondering what thoughts are for bringing it to the live site.
