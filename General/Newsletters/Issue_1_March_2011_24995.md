Could we possibly feature lead-ins to prospective plots, or excerpts from *current* games? Even a mini-comic would be cool. All in all very nice job! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

The first were some ideas Parmenter brought to the table when I explained the idea to the Council. All of your ideas would be welcome additions to the newsletter.

Um, I never saw this poll otherwise I would have voted for continuing it. I found it cause I was wondering when I could write up a new piece for the Arena. Is this still a viable thing? Could easily make it a quarterly newsletter. That would probably be best for game updates considering the slow speed of the medium.

Ya, I want to continue this however I find myself with little time and energy to continue something I didn't get much feedback on.
Thanks for putting up your comments!

**You have my bamboo pad!**
And by that I mean to say that I'd love to try to illustrate a scene from the site as a little flare to the newsletter. I'm no artist, but I'm paying back loans to the contrary and it's about time I put my art degree to use. Let me know your thoughts! <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->
