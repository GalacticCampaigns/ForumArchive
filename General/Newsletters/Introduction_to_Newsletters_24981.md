# Introduction to Newsletters

### **Alicia** (2011-02-12 14:22:23)

As our site has a long standing history of being first and foremost a community, I decided it was about time we had a newsletter. After all, what community doesn’t have a newsletter? At present, this newsletter is planned to be sent out every other month, or perhaps more frequently depending on member responses.
The purpose of this newsletter will be to provide all members an opportunity to catch up on the recent events occurring on the site, while also informing them about important issues. With the help of GM’s a list of current and open casting calls will be previewed giving all members an idea of what new (and current games) are recruiting.
It is my greatest hope members will take advantage of this wonderful resource of keeping in touch with the activity within our community. As this idea can only grow, I hope to see other members eager to help participate in it’s creation, whether in a Game Feature where GM’s can give a synopsis to their game or highlight an achievement of their players, or a member interview similar to our Meet the Team thread, or even in just passing along their ideas to help make a segment grow.
