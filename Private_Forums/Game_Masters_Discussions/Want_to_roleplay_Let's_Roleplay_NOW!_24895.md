# Want to roleplay? Let's Roleplay NOW!

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-11-14 16:22:23)

Hello everyone. Recently me and Simply discussed an idea about being able to log on and immediately roleplay. To elaborate on this notion, I propose a roleplaying chat room. Or a roleplaying hub. Similar to an MMO, we'd all make character sheets and develop our characters within a roleplaying room. All we need is the GM's to get interested in the idea and be able to join a room full of players to take them on one shot adventures. We'd play exclusively in one era, and everyone would have a character sheet that continuously locks with the other GM's adventures. Obviously, we'd have to set the cohesive faction and era for our players to participate in.
Concluding the one time adventure, the GM's distribute XP. This way a player will value their character as they take them through a multitude of adventures provided by the GM's. All the while, they get to roleplay in the hub until another GM comes along. With a little luck, the roleplaying on this site would be 24/7.
It would work very similar to an MMO as I said. It would liven up the chat room and create interest. But I need to know how many GM's are interested in being able to log into the roleplaying rooms and occasionally take players on adventures.

I think it should be noted that in our conversations, it was agreed when this is proposed to the community as a whole we will be deciding as a community what setting we will be using.
Right now DW is looking for an initial response from fellow GMs to see who is interested in being among the first batch of GM's to support this system of play.
The basic idea itself for this persistent RP world is rather intriguing. I've seen it done for an M&M game run on ORPG and it seemed to do reasonably well, though most the times I was in there in the mornings, players were sitting and chatting. The premise allows for a GM to pop in and run with as many players are currently interested in playing. Since each session works best as oneshot, things should be resolved by the end of the play time. In between GM lead sessions, the players would be free to RP amongst themselves.
SOmethings we may want to take into consideration:
We will need a common theme or goal that the GMs should decide is the ultimate goal. It may even be best to work out a rough outline for a campaign. I say rough as it is highly likely we won't only just GM but be players too, though I trust we can play without metagaming too much.
Tru suggested in the chat that it may be best to set up specific days at first. While I agree this could be beneficial, it still might be nice for GMs to lead players through some activities to keep their interest between longer sessions. This is after all supposed to promote more instantaneous gaming, if even two people are interested in RPing they should feel comfortable enough to just move to a room and proceed.
I'll probably have more thoughts later, but that's what I've come up with so far in my somewhat sleep delirious state.

We not only need to talk setting, we also have to decide on system. It should be something fairly simple to run in chat with minimal to no book referencing, as well as something that lends itself to easy (or even on the fly) adventure and enemy design for the GM. This allows for a lot more spontaneity when it comes to devising and running adventures, meaning that there will be more plotted action more often.

Whoever voted for more details needs to PM me, so we can discuss this matter.
