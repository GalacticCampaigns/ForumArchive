# Chat Roleplaying System

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-02 03:11:40)

While going through our old topics Alicia found a system for chat roleplaying I'd posted way back in 2007! I had a read through it and realised there's actually quite a lot to like about it, so I've polished up my original post, named the system, and added it to my Blog [here](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/blog.php?b=23 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/blog.php?b=23").
**Drake** (as I have named it, to continue the theme started with Dragane) is a simple and effective system for resolving conflicts between characters of varying power levels and can be easily modified to include any number of Attributes and Skills. It can be run in any chat room (naturally including the Galactic Campaigns chat) that has a dice-rolling code. Drake could also conceivably be used to run games on the forum, since the dice code here, like the one in chat, allows the unusual die sizes that appear in the game.
If I run any chat games in the future (which is something I've been considering) I'll definitely use this, and may also use it for simpler one-off adventures on the forum. Hopefully you all might consider making use of it too.
