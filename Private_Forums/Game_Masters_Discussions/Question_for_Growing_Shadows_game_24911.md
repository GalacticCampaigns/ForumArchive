Where would be a good place to hide a tracking device that wouldn't be entirely noticeable even after an initial search.
This is for a citedal-class cruiser and i have a deckplan here: <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?p=52474#p52474](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=52474#p52474 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=52474#p52474")<!-- l -->

any where really. I would suggest his armor, otherwise make it behind a bulkhead somewhere where it can't be found without a sensorpack to pick up its broadcasts. Or it can be an actual program in the com systems that requires a good programmer to find and remove. Or you could put it somewhere where there are lots of signals being put out, so only someone with knowledge of such tech or the frequency could find it hidden amongst the other signals, say for instance, the engine bay or weapons blisters.
Example
After several hours work going over the ship with the sensorpack, the crew found an odd signal emanating from behind the bulkhead directly behind the caf dispenser. Thirty minutes and some busted knuckles later after removing interior bulkhead, they find a small device roughly the size of a powerpack connected to the ships communications computer. This device is what has been sending out their exact coordinates using the ships own systems for the past three weeks...

Idea 1: Hide it in/around the engines. The device would have to be extremely durable to withstand this, but who is going to detect a low energy level masked by the huge energy surge of the engines? This would also probably block the device's signal while in flight, but the moment the engines are turned off, ie. when the ship has landed in port and everyone has disembarked, the beacon would be sent out clear as day.
Idea 2: Hidden carefully behind another device.Even if the first device is found and disabled, it's deactivation triggers the second device. Most people wouldn't think to do a second sensor sweep of an area they believe they've just cleared.

As a "Sensor Booster" .. which *does* boost the sensors, but also transmits its location ...
