# Help me decide the future of Drakensban; Players: KEEP OUT!

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-29 22:45:04)

Hello all, this is the first of what I hope will be many polls in which I'm going to give my fellow GMs the ability to help determine the future of the Drakensban: End Times campaign. Hopefully this might also get you interested in reading the campaign, though even if you don't you should still feel able to take part in the poll.
If you play in said campaign, didn't you read the warning? This topic or any future topics like it aren't for you, unless you *want* to have the future events spoiled for you!
Back on topic: In the current events, a thieving crew has broken into the museum in which the characters are on guard to steal a work of art. I'm giving you the chance to help me decide who the leader of this thieving crew will be when encountered. I already know that he is a villain twisted into what he is by a damaged childhood, but I don't know what skills and abilities he will possess. I've presented four possibilities in the poll: please vote for your favourite!

I voted for the mage. The schizophrenia also makes for an interesting twist on his personality. It could be a good way to flesh out the mage in a way that the thieves are sort of a cult following. Perhaps they would follow him out of respect to his power and his crazy ideals? I don't know what the work of art is. But perhaps it would have some kind of great symbolic meaning to the mage and he is crazy enough to acquire it with his vast power.
Plus, I'm kind of partial to mages :P

I voted for the mage also. I wonder why there is only one tally there?
