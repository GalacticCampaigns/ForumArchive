# Developers and Testers Wanted!

### **simplyscribed** (2010-10-29 22:16:14)

Hey guys!
As you probably already know, I'm working on my own system called [Dragane](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=211&t=24826&p=54160#p54160 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=211&t=24826&p=54160#p54160"), for which I'm running a playtest game called Drakensban: End Times. What you might not have realised yet is that I have a [sub-forum within that game](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=211 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=211") that I'm using for system development with help from my playtesters.
You don't have to be a playtester in Drakensban: End Times to help out! I figure since you're all GMs you've all learned and used at least one roleplaying system and probably many more than one. You're also probably comfortable designing your own additions to the system and making house-rules. If you have these qualities then you're perfectly qualified to give feedback, so if you'd be willing to look over Dragane and get involved over at the development forum, it'd sure be a great help.
