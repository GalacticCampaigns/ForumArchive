# Tips for PBP games - article submissions

### **Alicia** (2010-12-01 18:34:56)

Rowen started a thread providing tips to GMs new to PBP some time ago when the site was still young. I was wondering, as most of us are now comfortable in how we run our campaigns via PBP, if there's anything which should be added/edited from his initial "guide".
Here's the link to it, which is also available on the index of the GM forum <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=24174](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24174 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24174")<!-- l -->
Edit: All articles in this thread have been moved to the GM tips thread.

How about creating a new topic where we rearrange the guide into themed sections and compile the contributions of anyone who posts ideas as a reply, listing the contributor's screenname alongside their entry.
Sections could be:
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Planning the Game:</span>
tips for preparing the game, focusing on what unique traits to pbp games may affect this stage.
For example, my advice would be: **Think Small to Think Big**
So you ran a game for your mates, one night a week for a year. You told an epic story that spanned the breadth of the galaxy and three generations of heroes. Your players said it was the best game they'd ever been in. And you want to run it on the forum.
Don't. The first thing to realise about this medium is that it's slow and will require a lot of patience. The adventure that your mates took 5 hours to complete will span months of posting. A year's worth of adventures, realistically, will never come to pass.
This doesn't mean that an online campaign cannot last for an exceptionally long time and tell an epic tale, but the blunt truth of it is that this is rare. And if your vision is too large the reality will frustrate you.
A good approach is to plan things on a smaller scale. Write a short "season", with perhaps 6 "episodes"/adventures. The story arc for this should be self-contained. A smaller setup like this is much easier to bring to a successful close, giving your players and yourself something many online roleplayers never manage: closure. At the end of the season, if your players and yourself are still interested in the game's premise you can simply write another season! The plot will remain as simple and self-contained as the last, but you will have a wealth of NPCs and ideas to draw from which will make the second season feel even richer for an equal (or lesser) amount of effort.

I rather like that idea Simply, but this will definitely need the help and cooperation of our fellow GMs to fully complete. We could also use the FAQ system in place and have a thread for others to contribute to with the staff able to add/edit things to the FAQ as we go.

Tip for running: Description description description. Lay things out as concretely, clearly, and concisely as you are able.
Reason 1: Far too many times a player is left in the dark as to what's going on where and at what time. When you describe everything in as much detail as you can it gives the players clear boundaries and clearer options.
Reason 2: It also helps with player post quality. Many players can find themselves lacking in creativity for their posts due to a lack of things to react to. As GM, you set the standard for the post quality. If your posts are lacking then a good player will either not want to contribute because you aren't or will try to fill in the blanks as creatively as possible (fun, but can backfire quickly because you forgot to mention something or describe it fully, leading to retconning and editing). If the GM's post are incredibly detailed it fosters the 'group effort' feeling and helps players put forth their very best to improve the game.
Reason 3: It just makes the story better. Obvious I know, but all the same.
Examples and Ways to Make it Happen: Never trust player assumptions. Anyone can interpret a blandly described scene improperly, so don't expect them to see it your way. Describe as much as possible. If the PCs walk into a public place mention the crowds, the peacekeepers, the merchants, what the ground is composed of, what the structures are made of, what kind of clothing is worn, what style of weaponry is most prevalent, etc., etc.. You never know when the detail may become relevant, and assuming a player won't make it relevant is a horrid mistake. You don't have to go into great depth, just a few words to half a sentence each can save you all the headache and game death in the world. It doesn't take a good writer or even an average one to do it, it's simply listing all the resources. You can be as plain and bare-bones as you like or as sesquipedalian as you like.
Some things merit a game mechanics description. Just add to the OOC portion of the post a brief breakdown of what role a significant part of the backdrop can play in a combat encounter. Player creativity can be allowed more leeway here, but if they don't know that fountain can provide cover if a PC is adjacent then they may not take advantage of it. Personally, I prefer as much transparency in game as possible. I explain hazards in detail when first encountered, as well as skill challenges and the like. Giving a PC a clearly defined goal helps them and you.

**<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Concepts &amp; You</span>**
Before anyone can build a character, and after a player has the rules, the next step in building a better character is to work on concept. In the years I've been running RPGs, I've seen all manner of concepts cross my GM Screen; from the short *"I wanna play that guy that does that thing with those people"* to the near novella sized idea that should be made into an epic movie in the next four years. But what is a concept really?
Every Gamemaster has a different idea on what they require from players, but the following is some general rules that players should consider before submitting a concept:

* **Be Concise In Your Concept:** No one needs a doctorate-level thesis on what your character is meant to be, but also don't be a two sentence wonder. Take the time to think about what you want from your character and how they might be able to work within the group structure.
* **Discussion Is The Key:** Keeping your ideas to yourself helps no one, especially yourself. Discuss your ideas with the GM and some of the players to help round out the character and fit them into the campaign. Most campaigns should stretch a bit to work with player ideas, but most players should be mindful to the campaign world. If your story is that good, then the GM will find a way to work with you on it.
* **Be An Adult:** This isn't a kiddie site and, as such, you should remain in-check with your maturity. Be respectful of everyone in the game and, especially, your GM. If a ruling is something you don't find desirable, speak to the group and GM in the OOC thread, or speak to the GM via Chat/IM. Respect that they'll do what's right for the game and, in turn, respect their decision. It's one thing to make a point and another to argue it.
* **Be Ready With Backups:** If you really want to get into a game, be ready to toss a few ideas at the GM. It shows them that you're interested, have taken the time to work on ideas and that you aren't afraid of altering things if need be.
* **Be Liquid Rather Than Solid:** Concepts change quite a bit while the campaign is starting … be part of that change rather than the wall that blocks it. Working with the GM and players makes a better gaming experience for everyone.
* **Ask Questions:** Don't be afraid of asking questions when working on your character. Gamemasters are there to answer questions as well as run games. If you don't ask, no one will help.
* **Player On Player Action:** Some of the best concepts that I've ever seen involved players working together to link concepts. This shows not only interest, but general camaraderie which is a good building block for teamwork. Mind you, there can be limits to linking one another so please talk to your GM first.

So what should a concept look like? For my games, I will generally ask for about a decent paragraph or two explaining the general idea of your character. This should include a brief snippet of history, who they are and what they have for abilities/skills. It also doesn't hurt to include a small paragraph describing why you want to play in the game, as that tends to help the GM gauge interests levels. In the end, working with the GM and other players creates a group environment, allowing for strong ties and group fun, because that's why we play.

Mainly for my own reference here's somethings I'll be touching on when I have the time to write them up.
Maintaining - Setting a schedule (Importance as a GM for setting aside consistent/regular times to post)
Running - Formatting suggestions (this will replace "Post Out of Character (OOC) remarks in italics" tip)
Starting - Explanation of the MCP including creating Stickies, Announcements, locking, splitting merging threads, etc.
Running - Better explanation of how the Dice roller works within a game setting.

### **Alicia** (2010-12-05 21:11:12)

Just had the idea of doing a Dos and Don'ts list for Casting Calls / Interest checks.
Anyone want to have a go?
Here's some right off the top of my head:

Do come up with an interesting campaign name
Don't expect potential players to know everything about the setting.
Do provide as much information as possible.

### **Alicia** (2010-12-10 05:55:59)

**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Formatting Suggestions</span>**
Every player and GM have a different style when it comes to how they format their posts in relation to the options BBCode has to offer. The following can be used as a key and to offer suggestions on how to clarify aspects of a post from In character (IC) content to out of character (OOC) comments.
Whichever format you use, please attempt to be consistent for the benefit of your fellow members.
**Post Models**
For the convenience of members, pre-formatted post templates have been created and are available for posts and PMs. The model is chosen via a drop down box located under the subject text box and then you click "insert". The model is inserted automatically wherever your cursor was last in the post text box. There is an array of models already created for use from Star Wars Sage Character and Vehicle Stat block templates to a Pathfinder template. Each model will have a guide created for them which will explain the layout. The guides can be found in the appropriate RPG Discussion forum.
Anyone is free to submit a model, and only needs to create a guide in the proper format for a template to be eligible.
Additionally, for the benefit of players, a model for dice rolling has been included. For more information please see this thread <!-- s=> -->![=&amp;gt;](https://i.ibb.co/ZRp1c1RL/icon-arrow.gif)<!-- s=> --> [Feature - Dice Rolls](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24538 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=24538")

---

**OOC Comments**
It is inevitable that OOC comments will have to be made in a post. These comments should be restricted to being relevant to any action which has occurred from a clarification to the GM on what your character is doing to the modifiers and/or roll. To keep a flow of a post, they should come at the end.
Most posters will put them in (( )) or in *italics in a different color**. The option to place OOC in Spoiler box is another great alternative as the text will be hidden completely, the dice code will work within the spoiler.

---

**A Character's Voice**
To place a distinction on what is said or thought, and what is described posters find it beneficial to have dialogue text place in bold and even in a different color. Dialogue in another language can be placed in a different color* to show the differences in the character's normal speech pattern. Additionally, a poster can have fun making up a language or make use of a translator and place the translation in a spoiler box at the bottom of the post as OOC.
Thoughts can be placed in italics, separating them further from spoken text and descriptors and some will even place it in bold like their dialogue or put it in a color*.
**<span style="font-size: 1.15em;">*</span>** Please keep in mind if you use different colors that we offer a variety of themes for members to use on this forum. The text should be legible on a tan, black, and white background.
(( Keep commenting.. I apparently lost what it was I wanted to include after this. ))

An addendum to the above post. If you want to use different colors, please, think about how they look. While I know it´s difficult since we use varying themes on the site, some colors are just terrible under some themes. For example, I can´t read the color-formatted text Alicia wrote above without highlighting it. Oh, well I can, but I have to look very close and very carefully. It´s the same with many colors, so from the perspective I think the Jedi Knights theme might be the worst.
**Suggestion:** We make a chart with text formatted in different colors, and have members using different themes rate how readable they are in their theme. Ratings from 1 to 5, 5 being the best. People should reasonably use the colors that have the highest rating in average over all themes.
Test - JK(5)
Test - JK(5)
Test - JK(4)
Test - JK(2)
Test - JK(1)
Test - JK(5)
Test - JK(5)
Test - JK(5)
Test - JK(3)
Test - JK(5)

Test - JK(1)

Something that Frost started in his game Void Stalkers was including all OOC in a spoiler at the end of a post, and I gotta admit, it makes the thread look much better and makes it easier to read through it as a narrative.

DA that might be a good idea, but there are a lot of colors we would have to go through for people to rate. There's also the issue of people doing it. I might have a way to get it done easily, and I'll make it a project for the future.

Does Frost use dice rolls?
I've never tested to see if they are visible in a spoiler.
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

***** +mod
[Invalid dice roll_id: 1d20]
**Attack** weapon +mod (special notes)
[Invalid dice roll_id: 1d20]
***damage*** +mod
[Invalid dice roll_id: 2d8]

</details>

**Edit**: And there we go... while practical... I know now we can't put dice in spoilers

Well, yeah, I wouldn´t consider it high priority or anything, it´s just that I´m tired of people starting out with a good idea (color codes) but end up with something that doubles the times it takes to read the post.

That might be something to look into, since it has worked before. If you look at some posts in the Void Stalkers game (pg 27-28 has some examples), you can see it working.

OH! It could be that this forum is set to not allow dice rolls, which is probably a high possibility. D'oh on my part lol

DON'T post a poll with an option for more information. Players are by nature lazy and have short attention spans. They also rarely believe they should be bothered with the hassle of putting their vague feelings into words to quantify why they aren't sure about something. Better yet, don't use polls at all, at least the not the 'yes, no, maybe' kind. Just write the interest check, do your very best to answer the obvious questions in the initial post, and then if the players are interested they'll ask questions on their own while posting concepts. With an option to vote for more information, they'll just vote and expect you to telepathically strip from their mind what they want to know.
DO lay a ground work of house rules early and try your damnedest to stick to it. Changing rules during play can be the biggest headache in the world, and it can lead some players to losing interest if it happens often.
DON'T make a casting call if you've got too many irons in the fire or aren't serious about running. If you get good responses to it and then back out, players begin to distrust you as a GM, and won't apply as quickly next time. If you start one anyway, give it the majority of your attention because it's your baby. If you let your own game slide for other games you do your players a disservice, and can count on them not being interested in any other game you decide to run. I know GMing is incredibly difficult, and that players can be some of the most selfish, lazy human beings you've ever met, but as GM you have to hold yourself to a higher standard. Without you, the game fails automatically.
