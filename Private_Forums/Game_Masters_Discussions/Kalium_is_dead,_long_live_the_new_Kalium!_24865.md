# Kalium is dead, long live the new "Kalium"!

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-03 13:59:58)

In chat a few days ago Alicia, Anazider, dreamwalker, Sketchpad and I were having a lively discussion about the future of the Kalium project. The general consensus was that with the current lack of interest, there is none. I believe it was Sketch who proposed that a similar project might be both more interesting and more manageable if it developed not a whole new Galaxy, but created a new sector for use in the existing Star Wars setting. There was also a suggestion that the sector be made difficult to reach, explaining it's lack of "presence" in canon.
There is a lot of merit to this: we still get to create an exciting new setting of our own, but it will be easier to manage. It is more likely to be used by the site's GMs in conjunction with their games, meaning we'll get more mileage out of the idea. Finally, something that allows for easy integration into existing games on the forum is more likely to get our community excited about it!
I think this is something that could easily be managed, and the fact of the matter is I already have a suitable setting partly completed (it even meets the difficult to reach qualification). Since I'm not doing anything with it anymore I thought I'd put it up for candidacy as a new shared development project. 2 systems within the area are already established if not complete, though we could add more. Please note that the setting was originally developed for the Legacy Era game *Ripples in the Deep* so some of the entries I'm about to post will contain details specific to that era.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">The Itara Cluster</span>
The Itara Cluster is a grouping of several hundred closely arranged stars located near the edge of the Deep Core. Most of these are so close to each other that their systems anre uninhabitable and often dangerous. The arrangement also protects the central systems, which are stable and inhabited, from easy access via hyperspace trave. There is a single hyperspace lane, which only opens intermittently under the waxing and waning influence of a dying star. Even the most capable algorithms only correctly predict the lane's access times with about sixty percent accuracy, so very little traffic ever passes in or out of the cluster.
The cluster's inhabitable central systems were discovered in the waning days of the Old Republic, though colonisation efforts were slow. After Palpatine's take over, the Empire subjugated the small populaces of the cluster, valuing its privacy and security. Though nothing on the scale of the Death Star or Sun Crusher was ever built there, several research and development facilities within the cluster were responsible for providing the Emperor with some of his most devastating weapons.
The New Republic never came to the cluster, and Imperial government thrived there even after Pellaeon's and the Empire's surrender. The governers lost interest in pursuing Imperial agendas once the news reached them, however, and within the next decade had largely been replaced by more democratic governments. Some fought to keep control but most willingly resigned, retiring into obscurity.
In 137 ABY, the cluster's worlds have long since become independently governed and self-sustaining. They export little of real worth, a fact that puts them low on the Sith Empire's priorities. Several Imperial facilities still exist, however, that if converted to new functions could be put to use by the Sith Empire or another faction. It may take them decades to turn their attention to this unimportant collection of worlds, but the time must eventually come.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Central System</span>
Though officially named the Itara System, most citizens prefer a less confusing name given "Itara" is also the name given to a planet within the system and the Cluster itself. Central System has become an acceptable alternative, sometimes even used on official documents, and refers to the fact that it is the most easily reached of all the Cluster's systems through the unreliable hyperspace corridor between the Cluster and the larger Galaxy.
The Central System comprises seven planets grouped around a single star. Three of those planets are inhabited.
===== Itara =====
**Pronounced:** It-ah-Ra
3rd planet from the system's sun, Itara is chiefly covered by stormy oceans and small islands. The largest landmasses are around the planet's equator, and it is on these storm-drenched shores that the City is built. The City covers almost every inch of available real estate on Itara, and is broken up into a number of smaller Districts which are in turn divided into Sections. Most Sections are residential with enough businesses to support the local community. However, some are entirely commercial, industrial, or otherwise specialised. One such example is the Administrative Section in District 1, where Itara's planetary government is based.
===== Salcu =====
**Pronounced:** Sarl-soo
2nd planet from the system's sun, Salcu's make-up is about 40% ocean and 60% landmass. The land is primarily plainsland and savannas, broken up by occasional craggy foothills and mountains. Forests are rare and sparsely populated.
A large area encircling the planet, known as the Band, periodically suffers extreme physical stress as a result of the migrations of titanic burrowing arthropods known as Sluuvath. The resultant earth movement means that this land is the most fertile on the planet.
Apart from brave frontier farm owners, the planet's sentient population chiefly dwells in several large walled settlements, the better to protect citizens from fearsome predators, particularly the Salcuan crag lions. The largest such settlement is the capital city, Tras, from where the Salcuan Planetary Government coordinate the general running of the entire planet.
===== Talletle =====
**Pronounced:** Tal-ee-tool
Though the 5th furthest planet from the system's sun, Talletle is far drier than Itara or Salcu. Positively arid, in fact. Its relative distance from the star does mean that it is not too hot, however, and despite the inherent difficulties of survival on a desert planet Talletle's citizens are relatively comfortable.
Talletle is chiefly known throughout the Cluster for its elaborate racing circuits, which see numerous types of vehicle face off against others of their kind (and occasionally each other) among the wind-tunnel canyons and across the still dunes. Speedfreaks from all over the Cluster and beyond find their way to Talletle to take part in the races and earn fame and fortune, not to mention experience the thrill of gunning the repulsor engines way beyond the limitis recommended by their manufacturer.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Pale Star System</span>
The Pale Star System's sun has seen brighter days, and the light it produces is somewhat weak. It is still not recommended to stare at it, however.
There are 13 worlds in the system, five of which are inhabited by sentient beings.
===== Ebaiwor =====
**Pronounced:** Eh-by-war
4th planet from the system's sun, Ebaiwor itself is an unstable volcanic world unsuitable for habitation. Its two jungle moons Ebaiwor Primo and Secundo, however, share a tropical climate that makes them infinitely more pleasant to dwell upon. The economoy of Ebaiwor is primarily built upon mining Ebaiworan flame rubies from within the superheated innards of the planet. Teshi Mining Concern and Balora Industries control the majority of this business between them, and as such they are also powerful forces of political influence on Ebaiwor.
===== Veval =====
**Pronounced:** Vee-varl
5th planet from the system's sun, Veval is a terrestial water world. It is primarily occupied by representatives of water-dwelling and amphibious species, though boasts one city, Tasem, that is built as much above the water as it is under it.
Archaeologists have discovered evidence of previous settlers or a native species by way of carvings and apparently sentient-made structures on the sea bed. It is increasingly less likely by the day that the civilisation that created these still exists, however, as vast portions of the oceanic world are now being scouted.
===== Thesbaed =====
**Pronounced:** Fay-es-bye-ed
Profile in development.
===== Lonhiade =====
**Pronounced:** Lon-he-ah-duh
Profile in development.
===== Quasre =====
**Pronounced:** Kwas-ray
12th planet from the system's sun, Quasre is a cold world. Even its most temperate zones around the planet's equator are snow fields, and its weather conditions are progressively worse the closer to its poles you travel. It is in these inhospitable climes, however, that the greatest sights are to be found: huge snow build-ups and great wind-sculpted ice formations form natural mazes with jagged mountains in their midst.
The snowy planet is also home to a sentient species. The Quasrene, who were discovered only during the period of Imperial control, were treated as second class citizens despite being the Cluster's only known natives. One of the effects of the Empire's downfall in the region was to put them in a position of new-found political significance. The Quasrene capital Tsof is built in a great ice cavern, constructed across its floor, its ceiling, and its walls.
==== See also ====
Quasrene, The
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Cluster&#39;s Edge</span>
The Cluster's Edge is not strictly a system but rather a nebulous region encircling the three occupied systems considered too close to the packed stars around for safe occupation. Despite this several colonies exist among the asteroids and worlds within Cluster's Edge, and these operate with a certain amount of autonomy from the governing bodies of the cluster.
The Cluster's Edge is also host to the popular race, the Cluster Thruster.

The "Big" Secret: I don't think any of my players ever worked out how I was naming planets and cities in the Itara Cluster. I guess I'm spoiling the secret now, but if we were to take this on as a shared setting it might be fun to continue the same naming policy I was using.
It's actually quite simple: I was jumbling letters from the names of companies within the videogame industry. "Itara", for instance, is "Atari", the planet "Salcu" is "Lucas" while it's capital "Tras" is "Arts". See if you can figure out the others. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Give that man a cookie.
Though I suppose Tsof should really be Xine, these days, shouldn't it?

These are great ideas. The story also does not interfere with the canon of the primary Star Wars realm, but keeps the brilliance of its originality. Simply has taken great initiative; but if this is going to be a group project, we need to treat this like a movie.
We need a director, and the director to appoint the tasks of designing the Itara Cluster. The director will delegate what we need to do to bring the Itara Cluster into a functioning roleplay element.
Therefore, I propose that we first establish a leader, then we move from there. Potential leaders must show they actually want to be the leader then we vote.
The Leader should be voted by everyone on the site, and the leader who is elected is in charge on the success or failure of the Itara Cluster concept.
With proper leadership; we'll achieve direction, with direction we will get execution. And once we execute, the concept will come to fruition.

### **Alicia** (2010-11-03 21:40:36)

As Simply is the creator of the original idea and has already told me he was interested in helping to drive a restart/re-imagining of Kalium, he's my choice to be leader.

I am willing to take it on, and the ideas I was originally going to implement for Kalium could be used in part or whole for this.

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-11-03 23:47:33)

I believe whoever has the most passion for this concept should be a candidate. The question is...do we have anymore candidates besides Simply? The more competition the higher the chances of the project's success. Anyone else want to be project leader of the Itara Cluster?

### **Yogi** (2010-11-04 00:29:59)

Like we beat to death in the chat. Putting a vote up isn't going to get the masses to flock to the booth. Only the ones who care will vote.
Simply has my nod of approval to lead this project.

Indeed it should, but I'll let ya slide if for no other reason than nostalgia. Thanks for the cookie. I try to cut back these days but what the heck, it's a free cookie!
On a more serious note I can't think of anyone better to lead than simplyscribed. Though perhaps my vote shouldn't count for much since I've never had much interest in the Kalium project. However, now that it's going to be an addition to the canonical universe rather than a replacement it might attract more of my attention.
Here's a name you can use that follows simply's convention: Nidabosi.

### **Dreamwalker** (2010-11-04 17:06:43)

Yes, looks like simply is winning by a landslide. It's his idea. One last thing though, do we want a panel of leaders? Or just one leader responsible for success or failure of this project? Someone did mention the idea of a panel in the chat before.

Perhaps we could leave the system half finished?

Haha, awesome! Ohh, maybe it's a half-finished space station that gets abandoned by the original owner (maybe a now defunct government?). Then smugglers/pirates/whatever move in and use it as a base. I'm imagining something like the Wheel from Legacy, only crummier.

If using the same model I proposed for Kalium, panels of three Judges would be formed to review submissions. Ideally, there would be different panels for varying types of submission to keep things a little fresher. Anyone helping to develop the setting would be a potential candidate who might be asked to sit on one or more panels.

Then I think you need to designate the tasks needed, so we can start proposing the appropriate members for said tasks.

First thing is to present Itara to the whole community and give them a chance to get on board. I wanted to soundboard this with the GMs first before making a public fuss, but now there appears to be some energy and direction it might be time.

There, folks. Posted something of a recruitment drive as a Global Announce. It might help if you post your own interest to that thread to add some weight behind it, just to make sure people know it's not just another hare-brained scheme of mine and mine alone.

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-13 18:38:07)

The Itara Project forums are live.
I am looking for volunteers to sit on the first review panel, which will be responsible for judging submissions of planets and other geographical features.
