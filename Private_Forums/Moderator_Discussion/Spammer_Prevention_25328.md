# Spammer Prevention

### **Alicia** (2013-02-27 16:55:08)

Today I have installed a new system which should prevent spammers from registering through use of IP and email blacklists. This also makes it possible to remove the pesky captchas that a lot of people don't like and possible to remove the moderation restrictions which have been forcing new users to post only in the Introduction forum and with approval in two others (Casting Call and VTT Homefront). For now I think I'll keep up the moderation of the newly registered users until I see how many false positives this gives us, but I'm very hopeful.
What this means for you guys is that now when we remove a suspected spammer there's a new process. This mainly effects myself and the global moderators as we are the only ones with the power to delete users from the site.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">When administrating a user, there will now be the option to report the user (email and IP address) as a spammer to the blacklists to prevent them from operating. It also removes their posts from the board in one swoop.</span>

The easiest way to access this screen is to enter a user's profile. Next to their name will be a link: [Administer User].
