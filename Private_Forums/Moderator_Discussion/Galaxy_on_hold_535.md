# Galaxy on hold

### **Rowen** (2007-10-01 12:14:32)

So you guys may have seen the Galaxy on hold message. Tru this is something me and Simply had talked about last night in chat. In order to redirect and optimize the creation process we put it on hold for member interaction for a few weeks.
I'm going to write up the history as before, using what little you both saw and taking it a step further. Then you both can nit pick the time line and we can make changes together. Once we have the time line fleshed out we can introduce it to the member population and have contests for NPC's and other Major/minor character. Even let members create the backgrounds for the major NPC's in the world. Creating there story if you will.
Before we even release that info into the fray we will also work on the Living galaxy rules, which will be similar to the RPGA's living force. Again, Ill type up a loose rule set and submit it here for the both of you to go over and fine tune. Then we can release both to the community.
Some things I'll be working on or can add:
1. I have enough subdomain space (unlimited) with this hosting package to make a Kalium Galaxy section for the website. Listing the history, character creation, NPC's ect. Thats one thing I wanted to let you both know was available.
2. Ill be picking up either a Java script or PHP book at the store today for the expressed purpose of creating a character generator for the Kailum Galaxy. (Since a few things will be changed I believe I can get away with this since it wont be strictly Star Wars.) Besides I've always wanted to know how to code......used to do it with small applications a few years ago and loved it.
Anyway, this should catch you up Tru. Wish you could have been there with us. It was definitely an impromptu discussion.

Thats kind of what I was saying in my last mod post, it all works out int the end. Did I miss anything else important?

We talked about what to add or leave. Here are a few things we talked about.....Ill list the ones I can remember so I can get your input on them as well.
1. Force traditions. Having multiple traditions to make force users more specialized.
2. Making the Jedi not the end-all be-all of characters. Taken them a step back and making them rarer.
3. Having some classes unlockable threw a rewards program in the Living Force. Mainly not letting Jedi be a class one could play right off. This will encompass weapons, armor, even equipment.
4. Making sure the rules for the Living force are complete at release but not to restrictive to choke player or GM creativity.
I think that is about it right now.

Thanks for bringing me up to speed, I wstill want multiple force traditions.

I don`t see the jedi as the end of all classes, the other classes have been beefed up and the jedi are the hardest class to play. Sometimes every decision made has to be though through what are the consequences will this lead to the dark side. No the jedi have alot to bring to any table but so does a well played scout, soldier scoundrel and nobel.

But they are (force-users in general, not just Jedi) mechanically better, and there's no escaping it. Not massively, gamebreakingly so, but the difference is there. That's not a problem in your average campaign where things are balanced for group play, but it might be more significant in a living campaign where you're not always going to be part of the same group and will move between games. In such a system characters need to be carefully balanced against each other for fairness, and the force rules, or at least how much of them is available to players, might need a little tweaking considering that.
