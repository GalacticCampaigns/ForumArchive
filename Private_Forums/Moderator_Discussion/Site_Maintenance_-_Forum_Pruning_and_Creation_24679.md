# Site Maintenance - Forum Pruning and Creation

### **Alicia** (2010-06-02 15:21:17)

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Inactive Campaigns</span>
If a campaign has had no GM activity for 30 days, the GM will need to be PMed by the moderator in charge of that section. GMs should be given some time to respond back. You will be able to see if the PM was read through the PM manager. If it hasn't been read it will appear in your outbox.
Also, take this time to PM the players of the campaign. As Yogi posts below, the easiest way to do so would be to go to their character sheet in the Cast List and PM the sheets to them directly. By clicking the PM button on the post containing the character sheet it will be quoted in the PM. You may additionally inform them of the impending game purge.
If the activity inquiry is met with the result that the GM intends to attempt to continue then he should be given at least two weeks to show progress.
If there is no contact from the GM or the game is "dead", proceed with the following:

1. Edit the first post of the IC game threads and include "[Campaign Name]" in the title. Take not that if the title of the IC topic is already long, you may need to find ways to shorten it. Try making Chapter into Ch and using values like 1 and 2. ![first-post.png](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/images/forum/mod-tools/first-post.png)
2. Using the moderator control panel from the campaign forum view, move the threads to the histories archive without creating a shadow topic.

![mcp.png](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/images/forum/mod-tools/mcp.png)* Check the threads you are moving.
* From the drop down at the bottom, select "Move". Click submit.
* Select the forum where the topics will be moved.
* **Uncheck option to create a shadow topic.** Click Submit.

3. Enter the Admin Control Panel. The link is found at the bottom of the page near the credits. You will have to login a second time. And then you will have to click the ACP link again as the redirect script doesn't work properly.
Going to the Forum tab navigate to the campaign forum. Click on the ![icon_delete.gif](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/adm/images/icon_delete.gif)
Delete the forum and all posts within.
**Please double check all threads have been moved to the histories archive. Also, take a moment and take stock in what you are doing. This is a permanent action.**![acp-delete.png](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/images/forum/mod-tools/acp-delete.png)
Keeping the forums clean of inactive games is the responsibility of the moderator of that section.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Creating new forums</span>
Forums will need to be created by the request of the GMs. Since we all can create the forums, it was deemed necessary to require the GMs to post their request in the appropriate forum with them providing the information needed. This way we can all view the request and ensure it has been met. The request forum doesn't need to be pruned as after a week the site will do so for us automatically.

1. Enter the Administrator Control Panel (The link is found at the bottom of the page near the credits. You will have to login a second time. And you may have to click the ACP link again if you aren't redirected to the ACP.)
2. On the Forum tab, navigate to the section you wish to place the new campaign forum in.
3. Enter the name of the campaign into the text field at the bottom and click "Create new forum"
4. On this page, enter in the campaign information. The forum description should contain:

   ```
   [b]System or Era[/b]
   ```
**GM:** GM's name
Campaign description Make sure the following settings are used:

* List subforum in parent-forum legend: **Yes** (This should be "NO" for sub-forums created within the campaign forum. Otherwise they will appear on the Index page.)
Enable Quick Reply: **Yes*** Allow Dice: **Always**
* Default Dice Mode: **String and Total**

For general campaigns using a system, you can add a Forum image. Add the italicized text to the field. Here's some already created. Let me know if others are needed. The images are 50x50 px in the event you have an idea for one.
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Star Wars</span>**<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

6. <span style="font-size: 1.25em;">**Setting Permissions**</span>
To allow the GM near autonomous control of his forums (post stickies and announcements, move and delete posts/topics), it's important to set specific permissions for him to do so.
![acp-perm.png](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/images/forum/mod-tools/acp-perm.png)

* On the left menu, click 'Forum Permissions.'
* Enter the GM's name into the "Add User" text area, clicking "Add Permissions".
* In the drop down select "Full Access" and then click "Apply Permissions".

(**Global Moderators and Admins Only**) From either the "Forum" or the "Permissions" tab, select "Forum Moderators" from the left column.

* Use the same process as above to select the forum and enter in the GM's name in the user field.
* Assign the role of "Game Master" (this permission setting will allow the GM to delete, move, merge and split topics within their campaign forum.)
Apply the permission
7. In the Forum Request thread for the GM, make sure to post what has been done in the event there was part of the request you couldn't accomplish.

When you repeat the process for subforums, make sure to do the permissions first for the campaign forum. The permissions for subforums will copy from the campaign forum saving you steps in having to add the permissions to the subforums as well.
While this isn't part of a Moderator's duties it is something you can do to help out the Administrators.

Edited the first post... Does the little guide and pictures help?
I also provided Moderators with ACP forum access so you can delete and add forums when needed. That means you all are now welcome to add forums when a GM asks for it, however I don't believe you can add permissions.

Updated first post to include steps to add the GM as a Forum Moderator. This step can only be done by a Global Mod and Admin. Everything else is applicable for a Mod to accomplish.

Included the additional policy of notifying the players of the campaign at the same time as the GM to give them the opportunity to copy their character sheets and any other information getting deleted.

I just had an idea and implemented it with Moda's game.
I just went to the character thread and PM'ed the character post from the player to them. This way that get a PM with all the character info that was in the post. This way we don't have to wait for the players to go and get their info and we can clear the inactive board quicker.
I PM'ed Moda and he got the message but I haven't gotten a reply yet. I'll give it a couple more days before I nuke the game.

I noticed the images had gotten corrupted/missing, so I took the liberty of remaking them and further explaining a couple points.
If anything is unclear, please let me know.
