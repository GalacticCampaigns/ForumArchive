# Kalium Galaxy - Part Four (Final)

### **Rowen** (2008-01-08 11:34:02)

This list up to the present.
[hide]20 Years after Ara Noor arrived in the Kalium Galaxy her world was again turned upside down. In a coordinated strike the Sith managed to hyperspace directly to each planet. The battle that ensued was brutal.
All twelve of the rings were destroyed. Some effectively enough to leave only space dust floating beside their planets. Others broke orbit and floated off into space to settle in other areas of the galaxy. One plummeted to Jevim Nar creating a crater 40km wide in each direction.
Araâ€™s fighters performed as expected. There small numbers were able to destroy many of the Sith fighters. Casualties were heavy on both sides but still the battle waged on. The closest of the core worlds received the greatest protection. Most of the Sith capital ships were destroyed leaving the fighters swarming around to be picked off.
The Siths number had increased greatly, enough that the capitol was under ground assault. Ara Noor, attempting to get to her fighter was cut off by the ground troops. In her fight she left all inhibitions behind and ignited her lightsaber. It was by her hand that the leaders of the unified galactic government (UGG) survived.
Several squadrons survived that onslaught, each side lost many good men and women. Innocents were killed on many of the core worlds. Eventually the Sith broke their attack and retreated but not without first promising to return and finish what they started. The core was left to ponder its humanity.
The coming months brought forth many changes. The first of which was for Ara to explain her actions to the UGG. They were grateful for her assistance and the information that she had given them since her arrival. She was allowed to create a new Jedi Order, one that would exceed the Council of old. She was allowed to mold it as she saw fit and would be granted any resources she needed to establish and train her new students.
The Sith fell back to regroup and train. They had enacted there revenge but hungered for more. The hundreds of years of planning and preparing had left them with no other choice and it was now their life. They knew it would not be long before they were found. They were surprised the core worlds had technology to match their own. It was something they would soon not forget.
((This is where it ends and the adventures begin. The worlds are in chaos, a real and dangerous enemy threatens their security. The Jedi are a small faction, the Sith larger but still not as prominent as the Protectorate army. Criminal organizations are able to get a foot hold in the society. The major players are the Soldiers, scouts, ect. And the Jedi are left open to be molded as we want, with traditions ect.))[/hide]
I'm interested in hearing what you both have to say. I think I still left enough open for member creation and additions. It leads to what we were trying to accomplish and gives a direction. Once I hear from both of you I will advance from there. I have a few surprises in store hehe.

Feedback so far, then -
[ul]
[*]The nature of the Genealogy Wars needs to be clarified.  
[*]Those Firaxians that didn't escape (not all would have)… What happened to them? Did the Galaxy ever realise how ridiculous and bigoted its persecution of the Firaxians and those that shared their genetic makeup was? Was it already guilty when the Firaxian-Sith showed up?  
[*]Those Firaxians that did escape would have met other species and technologies, though such encounters would mostly be accidental and occasionally raids, in an effort not to leave a trail.[/ul]

Something else to possibly add here:
-The sith fleet fell back, kind of like the empire after the rebellion, though during the war many where in influenced (or turned ) by the sith leaving behind many in key political positions.
-Many would have fallen during the war taking its toll on hero`s on both sides (especially the jedi order).
- As part of the current chaos many of the core worlds (influenced by the sith) have begun the hunts again. This practice may not be allowed by all but it would give yet another interesting foe to any game. Witch hunts are fun and mixed with politics make for good story lines.
- various force traditions though small in numbers have begun to show up here and there with their own take on the force, this could go any direction here (but the end result I am thinking is a neutral force organization).
more to come <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Just an FYI some of the members do want to get a start on the galaxy build, are we getting ready to begin again? I know that we have a lot on our plates but this is a slow build something that we could be proud of after it is completed.
