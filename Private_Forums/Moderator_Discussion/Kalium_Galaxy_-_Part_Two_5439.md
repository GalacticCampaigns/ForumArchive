This recounts the Firaxian peoples escape and later resettlement on an outer rim world.
[hide]One hundred years later the escaped Firaxian people find refuge in one of the outer rim worlds. Many died during the long voyage and a new generation was born in space flight. Rebuilding their lives on a new planet was difficult but they managed. They kept their ships intact and used them and the equipment they carried to create a city much like their home planet. Several years into the rebuilding a ship crashes just beyond the city.
The pilot managed to crash land on a remote planet in the outer rim, in the Crux system. He is found and nursed back to health by the Firaxian people. Once physically able he introduces himself as Edrik Carn, Sith Lord and recounts his mission and its tragic end. The people awe at his control of what they now know is the force, and he begins to teach them how to hone their power.
Through his tutelage and leadership the Firaxian people thrive and begin to create a new age. An age in Edrik Carns own vision. He orders ships to be made using his crashed space craft as a blue print. Through manipulation he also manages to connect his data pad to their computers to give the Firaxian engineers the schematic they need for larger, more powerful ships.
As the years passed the hatred taught by Edrik reaches its peak and the Firaxian people, under the leadership of their Sith lord begin to prepare for retribution. The core worlds that shunned them would fall under there might. Ship production is increased and training begins.[/hide]
Again, check for inconsistencies, errors, and let me know what you think.

I'm not seeing problems with this - provided, of course, the changes re: the genealogy wars in the first part of the history don't affect it.

We could add that the Firaxians meet vaious alien races during their long trip (both good and well not good) learning from them new tech. Most encounters would be accidental, the Firaxians would take what they need from these encounters.

Sounds like a good plan Tru, It would be feasible that they would meet other races as they made there way.
