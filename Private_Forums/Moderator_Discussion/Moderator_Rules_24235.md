**Moderator Rules**
Welcome moderators! It is my great pleasure to give you access to the moderator forums. This forum should be used to discuss issues that arise on the site. Have an idea for an event or contest, post it here. Is a member causing trouble, post it here. This is our place to discuss, plan and coordinate for the site. However, with great power comes great responsibility. (I love that line! J ) So I must list the rules moderators should follow just in case.
1. As a moderator you should remain neutral in all disputes. If you think you can't handle a situation don't hesitate to pass it to the Global Moderators or Administrator.
2. Moderator's are in charge of their assigned forums and sub-forums. It is your responsibility to remove spam and handle member disputes. If gaming forums are under your charge you are to move the game files to there respective history forums when completed. (Note: Games with no activity in 30 days are to be moved to the histories forum only if the game files reached or exceeded 10 pages in length. If they have not reached 10 pages in length PM the Administrator for the entire forum to be deleted.) Please see the Site Maintenace sticky for further information in pruning the campaigns.
3. Moderators are to be actively involved with the community. You are encouraged to start discussions, actively post in member discussions and generally create activity within the community. Not being active or keeping up with your moderator duties will result in your moderator status being removed. (This applies to Global Moderators as well). If as a moderator you become inactive without warning for 60 days and have not responded to PMs or emails then your moderator status will be revoked.
4. The forum rules still apply to moderators and I expect every moderator to read these rules and become familiar with them.
5. Abusing your power as a moderator will result in a immediate ban.
Note: The Star Wars RPG and General Role Playing sections of the forum will be moderated by all moderators. This will also include the Introduce Yourself and General Discussion forums.
