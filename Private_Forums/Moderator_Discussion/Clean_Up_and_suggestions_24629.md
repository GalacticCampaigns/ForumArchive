# Clean Up and suggestions

### **Alicia** (2010-04-18 12:56:21)

Hey all!
The time has come again where we need to evaluate which games are still active. Like before please go through, change the name of the threads to include the game name and move them. Once that's done post here the name of the forum so it can be deleted.
I'm also looking for suggestions on how we can get the community excited, bring in new members, etc. Over the past couple months visitation has decreased to about 40% and its worsening.

Some games have ended or just plain died.
Dw game ended
jason's game just stopped
zider and simply are having RL issues right now I think.
Add in the fact that the game line Is ending isn't good for attracting new players.
Maybe a little more promoting on the WotC boards showing that there is still a place for SW gaming might drum up some more members/visitors.

Promoting on the Wotc boards has gotten us members in the past and most likely will continue to do so. Though I am sure Rodney might not like that as we are some form of direct competition to his star wars RPG forum. A new add might spring new life with new members, I personally have not been to Wotc for some time and would have to request my pass.
Another matter should be addressed, why are games dieing? If this is not addressed it will continue to happen (we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past ....). From what I have seen I can think of a few reasons this might happen:
(this is in no way a reflection on any one person only my observations)
-low post rate can and will kill games, my game is not immune to this. My game for example has a lower post rate then I would like but has stood the test of time so far <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> recently I have seen more activity hoping this keeps up and I can get some characters off the dust ball.
-lack of imagination, harsh but true not every game is a good idea and in my opinion designed for a select few therefore doomed to fail for many.
-interpersonal break downs, rare but it has happened before and will happen again.
-RL issues has come up in the past and destroyed games, it sucks especially in a great game. I have been a player in a few games that ended this way. Being honest and upfront with your players/GM could save a few games (and may have already).
I am sure there are more examples the question we need to ask is what are we to do about this. New members are great we need them but we will lose them to failed games.
One suggestion would be to have GM`s apply to run a game (except mods). Remove the ability to create new games from the members and have them pitch their idea to us. Some ideas might not make it. Also the app procedure many GM`s have .... I am not a fan. Simply taking the first x number of members who app to a game is wrong in my mind. Creating a lively game means weeding out people who might not mix or who have not tried. Yogi for one knows that I will reject apps to a game.
Anyway that's my rant for now, time to watch The Simpson's with my wife <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Another thing we could perhaps do is to look at different systems as well, and perhaps announce on the WotC D&D boards to see if anyone there is interested. I haven´t minded the non-SW games we´ve had here, and I do believe most gamers have pretty broad interests, so even if they´ve mainly played D&D before, I have a feeling many would be interested in trying SW Saga out.
For example, I´ve been working on my conversion of the SAGA rules to a fantasy setting for quite some time now (admittedly it takes too long, because I keep changing my mind all the time), and when I´m done I had been hoping to gather some people here to test it.
Unfortunately it is really hard to say why people stop coming here or so, since I think that over the years, about 5% of the people who "dropped out" have given any actual reason to why they´ve done so, the other ones have just left.

Moved two threads from Grey-Jedi's game ***A Broken Galaxy*** to the histories and deleted the board for it. He hasnt been on since 5/28 and I sent him a PM last Wednesday asking about it.
