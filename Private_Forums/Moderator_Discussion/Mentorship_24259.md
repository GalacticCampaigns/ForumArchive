# Mentorship

### **Alicia** (2009-07-01 17:13:20)

Avarna and I were talking today (actually she was ranting and I was listening) about some relatively new people who have begun making characters for games and how completely unsuitable the builds were for the game and the concept they had created with the background and such.
It was suggested by someone else that perhaps these people needed a mentor, someone designated to a new player to help learn the fundamentals to creating first off a character (concept, history, personality) and then the actual build. This could even expand in to helping the person become a better player overall with the mentor giving pointers on how to post as time goes on.
Mentors of course would be those who have proven themselves to be reliable players and an active member of the community and would most likely need a note of commendation/recommendation from a GM.
It is my hope that by instituting such a program we can help make those we see as bad players (those who end up not sticking around very long) into better players through a learning experience.

This is an interesting idea.
My concern about it is that the very idea of receiving a mentor could be construed as insulting by many people. Some of those who "we see as bad players" have been rolelaying for some time and actually see themselves as good players.

We could put it forth in that all active players would have a mentor. It would take some organizing and cooperation from everyone but each person has something they can share with another which could help them grow to be a better player or even a GM.
It could be a co-mentorship of sorts.
Though those we designate as our more experienced players (those who would get the recommendations) would be the ones to be paired with new players. In that regard these mentors would have to be aware they may end up being partnered with multiple people.

This is an interesting idea. If implemented correctly. I agree that it could be insulting (or embarrassing) for older more seasoned RPers out there. If it were perhaps voluntary?
I also take some issue with the mentor idea a little in one regard. Helping the person to better make a character is fine, but not playing the min-max game. Saying your character basically sucks because you chose this skill set or talent and not this one. One of the defining things about having a diverse skill set is so that every character is different. Sure there are the 'argued' best skills, talents, ect. But does that mean someone should take them because of this?
If the mentor program isn't about min-maxing characters, and still giving players the right to choose what they think is cool then I'm all for it. If its forcing them to fixed templates because its 'the best' then no.

I agree which is why I said "creating first off a character (concept, history, personality) and then the actual build". The actual concept of the character would be stressed in the hope that a character is made more an actual person than a set of stats.

Then I give my stamp of approval. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
However, we need to figure out it would be implemented without embarrassment or hurt feelings.

All active players could be asked to answer a questionnaire which we could then use to partner people up. Those we know to be trouble players could be placed with someone we feel could handle them and do the most good.
In the end, everyone would have a partner and they would each mentor each other.
That's how I see it anyways
In the end we would still need to get people on board with the idea.

I think this is a great idea, provided its implemented correctly. I agree that there are players (mostly new to the site) who make characters entirely wrong for the games they're submitted to. If we can find a way to do it right, I think this could work really well.

So true. There's one person that I play with currently that makes the rest of us wonder if said person only reads the GM's posts and doesn't bother with the other players. I even questioned him/her once about the tactics we were discussing in the OCC thread that dealt with the groups current bad position. He/she responds with "why would I read that"
Good idea, yes. Could it be implemented badly, yes. What do we do about the ones who have been here for a long time but think that are good rp'ers and write good posts?
This has potential.

Here's another take. Why cant the GM be the mentor? It's an obvious choice since being the GM gives him/her the power to dictate what they want in their game and how things will run. Length of posts, types of characters, maybe how to make the character to fit into the game. ect.

This certainly helps, but the danger is that each GM will have particular quirks that make their mentorship a little unsuitable when it comes to other games.
One step we could take to create a community standard would be to draft a document setting out guidelines for good character creation and roleplaying behaviour. The document would be put together by us after polling the community, so their opinions are accounted for.
Then every GM wishing to use similar standards has a baseline to direct applicants and players toward. They are quite within their rights to say "your application will not be considered appropriate for the game if these standards aren't adhered to, and neither will your posts be if they are not of suitable quality."

Not a bad idea guys. Simply I like the document idea. We could hash that up and post it as a sticky. A GM could then link to is so that players submitting applications can read it and use the resources available. Lets keep brain storming everyone. Your all coming up with great idea's.
Now we just need to get the rest of the mods involved. <Search's for his 'kick in the butt' motivator>

I think that's a good start to getting the program off the ground. Once we get a set standard then people have something to work off of.
While having the GM be the mentor for all players within his game I rather prefer the idea that there is one person selected as a mentor partner. I believe one on one is significantly better than a GM who may be mentoring 4-7 other people at a time. Not to mention the partner may be more neurtral to what is going in the pbp as there's a chance they aren't a participant. Having a neutral voice give advice may make those who have so far been difficult be more willing to accept the advice.
