# Community announcement

### **Rowen** (2008-05-21 18:14:02)

((Here is the official announcement for the Kalium Galaxies return. Tell me what you think, if it sounds good, ect))
Everyone knows Star Wars. The poor farm boy thrust into an impossible adventure and came out a hero. Or about a young slave that was rescued from the sands of Tatooine by a Jedi. What about a galaxy without a Luke, Vader, or Han. A galaxy full of new adventures and unexpected encounters. A place youâ€™re not familiar with at all. If this has piqued your interests then please keep reading.
With the communities help we will create a unique Star Wars Galaxy. The force is still among its inhabitants and the Jedi are still ever present but in far fewer numbers. New races will make an appearance along with new planets to explore.
During various stages of the galaxies creation members will be allowed to submit their ideas and creations. Those ideas/creations chosen will be added to the credits and there name, item, or weapon will be added to the Galaxy.
This has been attempted before on this site, the first time it died do to the scale of the undertaking, the second never really got started. I have been in discussion with the other administrators and we have found a way to make the task less daunting. The first time the undertaking was something HUGE! You had a fresh new idea and EVERYONE was eager to participate. The flood of ideas was overwhelming and with no real direction it descended into chaos.
Our system breaks the galaxy up into small manageable parts. Starting with planets, then Species, ect. Instead of trying to come up with the entire galaxy in one fell swoop were just going with the core worlds. Basically gathering enough information to get the galaxy on its feet, make it feel alive and let the players and GMâ€™s help flesh out the world with their campaigns. We are taking the route that nets us excellent content with a playable galaxy in the quickest amount of time.
The steps and what we will work on next are listed below:
1. Planets â€“ Establishing the planets of the Galactic Core
2. Species of the galaxy â€“ Establishing the main species of the galaxy.
3. Creatures â€“ Establishing the beasts that roam the planets.
4. Factions â€“ Establishing a few factions within the galaxy.
5. Vehicles â€“ Establishing the land based, airborne and space faring vehicles in the galaxy.
6. Prominent NPCâ€™s â€“ Famous, wealthy, villainous, crime lord, these are the main NPCâ€™s that will populate the core worlds.
7. Weapons and Armor â€“ Establishing the guns, explosives, and armor that one can find in this new galaxy.
By this time Weapons and Armor are complete the galaxy should be playable for GMâ€™s and players.
Content once the galaxy is up and running will be by submissions and a review board. The review boards job is to make sure the content fits, that there are no obvious clashes with existing content .
Anything approved by the review board is considered canon for the Kalium Galaxy. GMâ€™s and players alike are allowed to submit histories for the Kalium galaxy based off of their adventures, however nothing canon is to be changed (death of an major NPC for instance) without approval from the board.
I think that is about everything needing to be covered at this time. Please congratulate Alicia and Breeder on there new roles as Moderatorâ€™s of the Kalium galaxy forums. They will be assisting us in keeping everything going smoothly.
Keep an eye out on the forums as things are on there way.

Everyone knows *Star Wars*, and the tales of its heroes. You're no doubt familiar with two stories in particular: The poor farm boy that is thrust into an impossible adventure and comes out a hero; or the young slave rescued from Tatooine by the Jedi.
It's old, it's familiar. "Classic", if you will. But what if there were a different galaxy far, far away? One without Luke or Vader, Han or Leia? A Galaxy full of new adventures and unexpected encounters? A place you're not familiar with at all?
If your interest is piqued, read on.

With the help of the community, we plan to create a new and unique Galaxy. Players will have access to the same options as ever - for example, the Force is as ever-present and the Jedi Order will have a place, albeit a less focal one - but it will be a very different place with very different play experiences.
The Galaxy will be developed in stages, during which members can submit their ideas. Those chosen will receive a writer's credit and the material will become a canonical part of the Galaxy.

You had a fresh new idea and EVERYONE was eager to participate. The flood of ideas was overwhelming and with no real direction it descended into chaos.

Older members will know that this isn't our first attempt to kick-start this project. In the past, we had not fully realised the daunting scale of the undertaking, and failed to exert enough control. Eager participation and a lack of control created a chaotic situation where the ideas had no direction or evolutionary process.

This time, we will deal with one area at a time, and be clearer about what we want. Additionally, we only plan to develop as much material as we need to get started with the most important thing - playing. For example, once we've developed the Galaxy's core worlds we will have enough to go on and can move on to the next development area. The idea is to generate enough information to get the Galaxy on its feet, give the setting life, and provide players and GMs enough material to get started with their campaigns. Of course, in as short a period of time as possible.
Here are the development areas:
1. Planets â€“ Establishing the planets of the Galactic Core.
2. Species of the galaxy â€“ Establishing the main species of the galaxy.
3. Creatures â€“ Establishing the beasts that roam the planets.
4. Factions â€“ Establishing a few factions within the galaxy.
5. Vehicles â€“ Establishing the land-based, airborne and space faring vehicles in the galaxy.
6. Prominent NPCs â€“ Famous, wealthy, villainous; these are the main NPCs that will populate the core worlds.
7. Weapons and Armor â€“ Establishing the guns, explosives, and armors that one can find in the galaxy.
> Content once the galaxy is up and running will be by submissions and a review board. The review boards job is to make sure the content fits, that there are no obvious clashes with existing content .
> Anything approved by the review board is considered canon for the Kalium Galaxy.

> Keep an eye out on the forums as things are on there way.

Once the Galaxy has reached a point where play can begin, additional development will be through submission and review. The review board, which will include the site Administrators as well as a team of newly promoted Kalium Moderators, have the job of making sure new content fits with the feel of the setting and doesn't clash with or contradict existing material. Anything that passes the review process becomes canonical.
The review board will also have the job of coordinating campaigns. Everything that occurs in a game has the potential to impact established canon, so GMs and players alike should not introduce new elements or create change within the setting (such as the initiation of a war or the death of an established NPC) without consulting with the board and receiving permission to go ahead. This level of control is not intended to crush your ability to create a story in the Kalium galaxy, but rather to ensure the best experience for everyone in what is, after all, a shared setting.
Keep an eye on out for the project to get underway in the near future, and please congratulate Alicia and BreederofPuppets on their new roles as Moderators for the Kalium galaxy forums.

Both versions look good we still have to talk to Alicia and Breeder when the time is right, but I think we will be ready soon. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Rowen** (2008-05-21 22:54:43)

Thanks for the rewrite Simply, I just can't seem to get my thoughts together sometimes and make it sound really good. Sometimes I can and sometimes I can't.....a disadvantage to having noisy children in the house lol. I like the flow of yours much better.
As for Alicia and Breeder, soon......Ill contact them very soon. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Rowen** (2008-05-21 23:40:25)

I've set up the Kalium Galaxy forums already. Getting us one step closer to breaking the news to everyone. I even have the planets listed already with a full write up (what was available on the old forum anyway). Made a running thread for planet names with all the great ones other members submitted during the contest. Hey, its a good start. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Rowen** (2008-05-22 12:24:44)

PM's were sent to Alicia and Breeder. Alicia has accepted already, waiting to hear from Breeder. Once I have both answers Ill post the announcement.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-05-24 19:22:14)

Still waiting on breeders reply, he has been to the site several times and has read the PM I sent. So I'm not sure he is keen on the idea......hopefully though. Just in case name a few more members you think might be good candidates.
What do you think about Darthanthrax
Looking back at the old site he was pretty active.

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-24 19:59:14)

I would like to see DA in on this, if Breeder turned it down.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-05-24 21:39:23)

I think Ill just send DA an invite anyway, that will make 6 total people that can assist with the Kalium galaxy. More than enough to keep things moving I think, and if Breeder never responds or turns it down we will still have two mods to help us out.
