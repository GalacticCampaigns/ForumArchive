# Kalium Galaxy - Part one

### **Rowen** (2008-01-07 17:59:53)

This is the first of several backgrounds that I will be posting for you two to take a look at. Each will flesh out the background that will bring the Kalium Galaxy to the present time (The time most GM's and players will want to run adventures in). This is the farthest out from present, the beginnings and what set everything in motion.
[hide]The galaxy was in mass chaos. Races fought against one another in petty squabbles and land mass rights. Peace was a bleak concept that no one could grasp. During a unified summit of all core worlds a scientist brought forth an ideaâ€¦..Hyperspace travel.
It was the first recorded account of a summit that did not end in bloodshed. Raceâ€™s and factions worked together in the hopes of what could be a greater future. Immediately Marcus Tain, the scientist responsible for the idea was elected to spear head its conception.
The Hyperspace rings would require massive resources to build. Contractors began bidding wars to be included in the gates construction, thus insuring a life time of work and a steady income. The wars quickly turned to violence, leading to Sabotage, espionage, and outright physical attacks. Smaller contractors were soon crushed by larger, resource heavy corporations. Only four of the largest remained for the construction of the rings.
Not all citizens relished the thought of hyperspace travel, or the strain it was placing on the lower class citizens. Countless setbacks were incurred when anti-hyperspace protestors started turning to coordinated attacks. Heavy damage was caused to nearly completed rings and hundreds of innocent workers killed. These attacks nearly stopped the program altogether but Marcus Tainâ€™s first galactic speech rallied for a unified galactic protectorate. This new entity would be responsible for keeping the gates and the citizens working on them safe.
An investigations branch was created within the protectorate ranks. It was their responsibility to investigate any infraction against the construction of the gates. Many of the aggressors were found to originate from the planet Firaxia. Further investigation of these people uncovered that they poses powers of the mind and body that most were unfamiliar with. The findings frightened most people, fearing the Firaxian people would become too powerful. They were labeled witches, wizards, and all manner of unspeakable names. The Galactic Protectorate was sent to police the planet.
DNA samples were taken from those found to have the forbidden powers. Through these samples the investigations branch, under supervision of the unified government, would track down those related to the undesirables and place them in internment camps. This was the start of the Genealogy wars. Where DNA make up was the deciding factor on a individuals freedom.
Marcus Tain died the day the first ring was complete. His successor, Tornik Scraf made his inaugural speech to the unified worlds. Promising to continue the gates construction and to further the role the Protectorates played in keeping the galaxy safe. It was at this time the Firaxian people decided to fight back!
The conflict that ensued was brutal and thousands of Firaxians died in the conflict. Thousands more were placed in prison camps and sent to private forced labor camps. Others fell into hiding, creating another life for themselves. Thousands more escaped on transports and stolen ships, using the warp gate as a means to propel them far from the core worlds. The unified government covered up the story. Tornik announced the ships were destroyed in a failed attempt to use the Hyperspace ring.[/hide]
More will follow as I write it. Either later tonight or in the next few days.

Okay guys, need input. I'm going to write more of the history today and hopefully post it in completion. That way we can make changes, point out inconsistencies and get it out there for the members to add to.
Simply I want that carnival in the galaxy, I hope you have everything still on that. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

This is the first major problem I've noticed. Since the Force is present in everything, it can't have a unique presence in the genetic makeup of a species. Therefore, it would be impossible to track Forcies this way. The genealogy wars don't seem that viable. In fact, the only way to track Forcies scientifically is if we use Midichlorians - and I don't think we'd be very popular if we did that. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->

I could swear I saved a copy somewhere, but can't find it right now. I might still be able to dig up the hand-written copy. Alternatively, I can rewrite it; the only things I can't recall specifically are the names of the circus and its owner. Other community members might recall those.

It wasnt that they were trying to detect the force. They were just using it as a means to track down relatives and incarcerating them. Maybe I should change it so that is reflected. Would it be viable then>?

Well, that makes it more viable for sure. It's a completely ignorant and bigoted tactic of course. That might mean the Firaxians and their "relatives" could have a lot of sympathy from other factions in the galaxy.
It could even be that when they escape and resettle, things change for the better, any remaining prisoners are freed, and the galaxy as a whole is very sorry for what it's done. And then the Firaxians come back as a Sith army. Ouch.
