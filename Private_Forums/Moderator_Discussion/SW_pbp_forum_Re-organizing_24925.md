# SW pbp forum Re-organizing

### **Alicia** (2010-11-30 20:59:39)

You may notice (or already have) that I've rearranged the SW PBP forum. I got rid of the separate categories for each era, combining New Rep and NJO era into one since we don't get a lot of hits for them. (I was also considering doing ROTE and Reb Era, but those are rather popular eras IMO).
Dave is the only one affected by this change (since his two forums were combined). Let me know if you have any concerns or questions concerning this change.
