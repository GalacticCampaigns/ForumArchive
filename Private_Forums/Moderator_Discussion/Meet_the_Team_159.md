# Meet the Team

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-26 06:50:19)

I was thinking we should have a thread in the "Introduce yourself forum", a sticky, with profiles on Rowen and us moderators.
Here's what I came up with:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sounds good to me

### **Rowen** (2007-09-26 08:07:24)

Sounds good to me as well. I was thinking how to do something like that and you've done a better job than I would have.
Love the part about keeping me in line. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-26 16:23:57)

I posted the topic - I took the liberty of editing the information you've already posted to make your "Other Info". Of course, you both are capable of editing the post to add anything else you'd like. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Rowen** (2007-09-26 19:25:45)

Great Job there Simply! Thats for doing that. I've been swamped.

---

### **simplyscribed** (2007-09-26 19:29:56)

No worries Rowen. I did consider leaving it for you to do, but I realised you and Tru had both posted all the information needed elsewhere so it was just a simple matter of compiling it and adding some info for my own profile. After that it doesn't really matter who posts it, does it? And you've had plenty of other stuff to keep you occupied anyway.
So it wasn't so much taking the initiative as being practical. <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->

### **master_Tru** (2007-09-26 19:40:41)

Hey you did a good job thanks. <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I can't seem to find the original posted thread for this that was released to the public and I would like to add this to the Staff post in the Site News section and include the new moderators.
Would you all be willing to update/create the new profile?
Edit: Ahah found it. This is what Simply originally posted a LONG time ago. And he apparently never typed one up for himself.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Meet the Team</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Rowen</span>
**Position:** Creator and Administrator
***Which entails:*** Making any and all changes/updates; paying costs (which couldn't be done without our members' generous donations); making the rules; and being the highest authority when rules are broken or during member disputes.
**Nationality:** United States (Georgia)
**Galactic Campaigns:** After Effects (Fin)
**Other Info:** A practicing nurse working the surgical floor, Rowen sometimes has some weird schedules: If you ever see him posting late at night, you know why! He is 32 years old, and is married with 4 children. His roleplaying experience before the advent of Saga Edition is primarily in D&D, though he did own several RCR books he never used. He owns several other RPGs, but never had a gaming group to play them with, spurring him to create the Star Wars: Galactic Adventures forum. You can see the success of that bright idea right here in the brand new Star Wars: Galactic Campaigns community.

**Nationality:** Canada
**Galactic Campaigns:** Star Wars Legacy
**Other Info:** Master_Tru is 31 years old, and is married with 2 children. He's Canadian and proud of it! He works for AT&T Wireless - if you're in the States and own a blackberry you may have already spoken to him! As well as his love for Star Wars, master_Tru is a huge D&D fan. He has been an active member of the community from the start, and was a natural choice for Moderator status.

Odd, I'm almost certain I did. :
Well anyways, sure I'd be willing to come up with something.

### **Alicia** (2009-12-29 10:08:15)

**Position:** Moderator

**Other Info:** As of writing moment 23 years old, and currently studying Computer Engineering with a few years left.

If it is SW or Fantasy, you can probably get me interested. Also loves to experiment with creating new rules or expanding existing ones. On a final note, I´ve spent 10 months receiving military training from the Swedish Ranger Corps.
