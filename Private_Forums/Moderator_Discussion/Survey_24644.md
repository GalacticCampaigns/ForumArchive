# Survey

### **Alicia** (2010-05-08 14:59:41)

I'm creating a survey which I will be emailing users that have been inactive for a period time. The first email will go out to those who have been active since April 1.
I would like to get some input on the survey so we can properly evaluate what the community is lacking or if the reasons for leaving were entirely personal.

I eventually want to create one for current members to evaluate their current experiences as well. If you have ideas for that one as well, please post them.

I sent out the email to the inactive players. If you all have any opinions about the survey please express them now.

Sounds like a good idea, though I feel that many members leave if they are not playing a game here.

Real life obligations and not being a participant do seem to be major factors.
It had been a main reason why I introduced free form gaming to help get more people involved since you could start a game or join with limited restrictions and it could move on if it didn't work out.
Anyone have any ideas on how best we could get people to participate outside of the GM generated games? Getting Kalium back moving should be another priority.
We need a definite submittal process so that we can get some official content.
Anyone seen MoDaVader around?

His profile says he was last logged in in February. Suppose its time to send him a poke.
