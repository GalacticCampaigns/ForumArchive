# Vote for new Global Moderator and Moderator

### **Alicia** (2010-06-10 11:23:01)

With Simply having been gone for over 70 days now and no sign of when he may return, I'm looking for someone who will be able to fill his shoes as a Global Moderator.
I'm setting up the poll to advance one of the current moderators to the position and we will vote amongst ourselves. If you are not interested in the position or would like to nominate someone outside of the current moderators, please PM me.
Since being a Global Moderator encompasses moderating the board as a whole, a GM is not expected to continue in their moderation of the specific forums. If you would like to continue in your specific moderating duties than please let me know.
Along with wanting a moderator to replace MoDaVader to take charge of the Kalium Galaxy, someone will need to take over the duties of the moderator advanced to global moderator. The moderator for Kalium can come from our current ranks or can be a new candidate that has shown extensive interest in Kalium.
Please PM or post here your candidates for the positions.

No offence to the others but I think the choice is obvious, all the candidates are great choices good luck to them. To bad about Simply has he said anything at all? Has anyone tried to reach him?

I believe Alicia has tried to email him a couple if not several times but got no response.

Unless Dave voted for himslef I think the vote was unanimous.
Now what about candidates for the positions. Any suggestions?

I saw Breeder was back on the site the other day. Is he back for the long haul? If so he may be good for the Kalium Mod.

I had initially thought of him as well, but not sure how active he's going to be.

Tempeste. He's active in Kalium. And he's been around for a while.

Simply, took the survey and left this response as to why he's leaving.
"Sorry, I just lost the time and a lot of stuff has happened. I've not been roleplaying at all lately and I'm not sure whether I still even have the urge. I'm just going to let things play out their course. I might return to the community in the future, but we'll just have to see."
Really sorry to hear it, but at least we know he's still around and doing well.
