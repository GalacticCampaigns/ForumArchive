# The Galaxy, a return?

### **Rowen** (2008-05-05 23:46:11)

Okay, we all remember the excitement that the Kalium Galaxy created. Itâ€™s something I truly wish to add to the site. However, we all know how involved this project can become. So Iâ€™ve been brain storming HOW we could still make a playable world but reduce the time involved in getting it up and running.
First I think we need to break it down. Perhaps not quite as much as we did the first go round. Members of the site should still have a say in the worldâ€™s structure, itâ€™s what got people excited about the idea to begin with. Here is a list of things I think we need to figure out, using member input of course.
1.Species of the galaxy. (For player characters as well as NPCâ€™s)
2.Classes (Not wanting to stray to far from core book here, mainly changes to Jedi here)
3.Beasts, Creatures and Factions (Things you can piss off and will try to kill you, lol)
4.Prominent NPC's (Major NPC's that players can use in their campaigns. From Bounty Hunters, to Crime lords)
5.Weapons and Armor (Pretty self explanatory here)
6.Vehicles (To include land, air and space faring craft)
7.Planets (We have some already, and with my salvaged info from our old site we have even more)
You might be wondering, what about the history Rowen? Well hereâ€™s the humdinger, there wonâ€™t be one. Least not something planned out. I figure we can slowly build the history. Perhaps using things from games run in this setting. Itâ€™s not really something we *have* to have right NOW. I believe the above information will create enough concrete pieces to make a campaign.
The plan so far is to release each of these as a thread (Like before). Stating what were looking for and how to submit the information. Then any member can post there created weapon, vehicle, ect. This information we decide to keep will then be placed on a official site for the Kalium Galaxy (a subsite of Galactic Campaigns) to be used as the Official source information on the Galaxy.
Iâ€™m still not sure what format I want that site in. Iâ€™m undecided if I will use a standard HTML format or something slightly more fancy. I'll figure it out in time I guess. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Anyway, thatâ€™s my idea. Tell me what you think and bring up any flaws in the plan you may notice. I look forward to hearing your input.

IT occurred to me that in creating some of these things we can in fact create small snippets of history into the Galaxy. For example, that DX-7B Pistol someone created, who made it? Who was the manufacture?
Little things like this could be used to help flesh out the Galaxy bit-by-bit. A much easier task than trying to come up with everything at one time.

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-06 04:49:43)

I'm going to give this some thought and not give a hasty reply. After all, we've been in this position a couple of times before and I'd rather this be the time we get it right than another flop.

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-06 07:34:50)

What are we talking a planet a system a sector? Keep in mind to create a galaxy we would not have to build everything just the core and a few outer areas, the Gm`s would create the rest as the games progress. Also pending another creation stall I would suggest that we brainstorm here build a layout to introduce to the members. This would allow any of the three of us to take over when/if this slow down (mind you once a week once every two weeks for development is fine with me)
Well thats my two cents for now <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **Rowen** (2008-05-06 08:16:29)

I'm in no rush to push this threw the door. As for the planets we have the core already made, it was decided by the first round. I really don't want to change those because I like them so much. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> Sticking with the core worlds I think is a good idea, we can expand at later dates. (Mind you the planets are there, even discovered but we wont flesh them out for some time)
The list (or Layout) I made in my first post is the order I would like things to be created and in that order. This thread is for us to brain storm HOW to present it to the member base. I already am working on a announcement telling everyone about the Kalium Galaxy's Return, but I will not post it until we have ironed out the details.
I would also like to stray away from using the term "contest" when starting these creation threads. Its not really a contest even though we will be the deciding factor on what gets accepted and what doesn't.
The other tries were indeed a *flop*, but I think that is because we tried to do to much too fast, and all at once. I've been brainstorming about this as much as I could since those attempts. In the proposed format we could have the deciding species done quickly (its all a matter of mentioning favorites really), Weapons can be alterations of existing SW weapons or even totally new weapons. So things will go much quicker than trying to flesh out an entire galaxy.
This will also be something on going, once we have the initial information stuff can be added bit-by-bit, fleshing out the galaxy even more. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-06 08:33:42)

I am good to go with this, and put in as much as time will afford me. Keeping the planets we already created will save time plus the site I made is cool. The above formate will be a good goal to set.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-05-06 22:24:47)

I think the biggest hurdle is going to be the Jedi path. While some really don't care for it, claiming its over powered, ect. I just don't think Jedi have a place in the Kalium Galaxy. I've been bashing my brain trying to come up with some way to meld force users into this galaxy. In reading Star Wars Rogue Planet, Obi Wan made mention of the "Potentium". Which is a different view on the force. Why not use that? Here is the link to the wiki about it:
<!-- m -->[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Potentium_Heretics](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Potentium_Heretics "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Potentium_Heretics")<!-- m -->
To them there is no evil in the force, the force is channeled threw the individual and that persons use of the force makes the action evil or good. The force itself is not good or evil like in Lucas's rendition.
It also makes mention of an ancient name for the force, they called it Ashla. It would be cool to keep this name instead of referring to it as the force.
The only thing we would need to have the members do is help come up with some traditions, feats/tallents (which would really be similar to the current setting) and decide on weapons for them.....lightsabers would be weird I think....hopefully we can think of something else.
Anyway, I've gone and written another book lol. Tell me what you guys think.

I suggest the following order instead:
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">1. Planets.</span>
Since we already have enough work on planets done, it makes sense to post it first and get it out of the way.
*At this point you've probably noticed I cut out Classes: We're creating a Galaxy here, not a system, so too much tweaking of the rules should be avoided. I definitely don't think new classes should be added, though there is a case for cutting out the Jedi completely.
Decisions that require a mechanical change should probably be considered seperately and put up for community voting.
However, there may be room to create new Prestige Classes - this would be implemented at the end of the list. Same with force tradition talent trees.*
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">2. Species of the galaxy.</span>
Yeah okay, this is kinda important. But we can kick play off using species we already have so I consider it to have the same import as planets at this stage. More are likely to be created naturally as games go on.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">3. Creatures.</span>
Separated this from factions as they're pretty different, and folded "Beast" in as they're pretty much the same thing. Once again, some material here is useful but things will develop in play.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">4. Factions.</span>
This is the first one I consider genuinely important as we can't draw from existing factions to much extent. We'll have to spend a reasonable amount of time on this, at the very least sketching them out.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">5. Vehicles.</span>
I've moved vehicles to a position before NPCs. The types of vehicles available are going to be different from the Lucas galaxy, and presenting players options for transport seems more important than telling them who various NPCs they might never meet are.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">6. Prominent NPCs.</span>
I'm actually a little dubious about the idea of creating prominent NPCs. Think about it: We spend time detailing a cool crime lord to be used as a nemesis, and then the first GM to use him in a game kills him off and changes the face of the Kalium Galaxy. Suddenly we have more work determining how the galaxy changes with him gone. This leads me to an observation*.
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">7. Weapons and Armor.</span>
There's no way these should be anywhere other than the end of the list. Primarily it's just a case of using existing weapon stats and changing the fluff. Exceptions might be made for unique weapons associated with species or factions - those should be developed along with the group they are associated with.
*<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">An observation.</span>
We need a system of inviability whereby a GM needs permission before doing anything in their game that changes something about the Galaxy. They are free to create, alter, and destroy their own NPCs and organisations that have little impact on the larger Galaxy, but using our "canon" material in a way that changes or destroys it requires them to seek blessings.
I figure initial implementation of this system would involve us three as the review committee, but it might be beneficial to promote a few other board members to "Kalium Galaxy Mods" to help us out with these decisions (and other Modding duties for the project).
> You might be wondering, what about the history Rowen? Well hereâ€™s the humdinger, there wonâ€™t be one. Least not something planned out. I figure we can slowly build the history. Perhaps using things from games run in this setting. Itâ€™s not really something we have to have right NOW. I believe the above information will create enough concrete pieces to make a campaign.

As you mention in your next post, no history at all is impossible. Developing species, factions, planets, even vehicles and equipment is going to provide snapshots of information. But that just makes your idea more viable.
I think it might be a good idea to *require* submissions to provide fluff before they become viable for acceptance. A bare statblock really adds nothing to our setting.
> The plan so far is to release each of these as a thread (Like before). Stating what were looking for and how to submit the information. Then any member can post there created weapon, vehicle, ect.

I'd suggest a wiki format, but that would take the project away from the forums. May as well have all submissions take place here.
> I would also like to stray away from using the term &quot;contest&quot; when starting these creation threads. Its not really a contest even though we will be the deciding factor on what gets accepted and what doesn&#39;t.

Agreed. Call them "submission threads".
> I think the biggest hurdle is going to be the Jedi path. While some really don&#39;t care for it, claiming its over powered, ect. I just don&#39;t think Jedi have a place in the Kalium Galaxy.

This is by far the most radical thing you've suggested. For my own money, I think it's a mistake. Star Wars without Jedi simply isn't Star Wars. I think it better to stick with our previous ideas of diminishing the order, making it a fallen one and thus raising the importance of other traditions to be its equal or even its better.
As a side note I think if the Jedi order has less prominence we can justify a case for removing the Jedi class and reassigning its talents as Force Talents and Force Tradition Talents. A minor (or non-existent) order does not justify its own class, and Jedi can be built as soldiers or as members of other classes.
> All the Potentium stuff.

You've actually got it a little wrong. The believers in Potentium don't claim there is no good or evil, far from it: they claim the Force is inherently "Good", and that the Dark Side is a perversion, while Jedi traditionally see the Force as having "Good" and "Evil" sides. So, it occurs to me that the two beliefs are ridiculously similar in point of fact.
With either system, using the Dark Side with anger in your heart nets you a DSP.
With Lucas' system, Dark Side powers always net you a DSP. With Potentium, they might not net you a DSP but it's practically impossible to think of a use for most dark side powers that couldn't be considered evil. So you'll end up with a DSP in 9 out of 10 cases.
"The Dark Side is evil" or "the Dark Side is the result of the user's evil" - a difference in philosophy that caused a huge rift that ultimately makes only the most insignificant difference. Like most philosophical arguments, in truth. Very realistic. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
Anyway, I think the point of that little rant was that implementing the Potentium as the correct way of viewing the Force doesn't change all that much in play. Therefore I''ll support that choice. I'd be more wary of taking a radical belief change and making it canon, because we really shouldn't be messing with how the Force works or we're changing the Kalium Galaxy beyond what can be considered a Star Wars experience.
> It also makes mention of an ancient name for the force, they called it Ashla. It would be cool to keep this name instead of referring to it as the force.

Fine by me. And huh, quite similar to the "Ali'la" name used by my Hobben shamans.

So did I kill this discussion, or what?

### **Rowen** (2008-05-20 07:12:48)

No, I've been quite sick the last 4-5 days and like I said would like to take it slow. I look at this thread almost every day and think about the input offered. I'm not wanting to rush it.
Besides I would like the forum activity to pick up a bit before we even announce this, cause its died down considerably.

---

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-20 08:05:09)

There is nothing stopping any of us from brainstorming our ideas here for a while. We could share our ideas here mold them and be that much more prepared for the launch.

I agree, its established and ready to go.
About the classes, granted I wrote that badly in my excitement to get the idea's down. But I was not intending of making any class changes other than Jedi. That was my bad.
> Prominent NPCs.
> I&#39;m actually a little dubious about the idea of creating prominent NPCs.

I agree here, in fact we can dump this section altogether.

The wiki format would be easier and its doable with this site but it would require yet another registration.

This is the only place I kinda disagree with you on. Its another galaxy with no knowledge of the lucas version, how would they know to call themselves Jedi? I would even hazard a guess that there force tallents would be slightly different, more primal possibly and a little less refined.
I could be digging a bit to deep there but I'm open to suggestion. I figured having the Jedi/Sith battle of old would be a bit boring and frankly nothing NEW.

### **master_Tru** (2008-05-20 09:24:36)

Planets are done for the most part; more will be created and fleshed out as the games progress. NPCs same deal they will be created via the gamming process. Changes with tech politics etc.... should be have an application process.
GMs would have to ask permission to make these changes that brings up another point. The three of us would be the obvious choices we may need another, if we would like to play in these games. We should not all be in the same games no more then two in any one game.
Jedi well I do see them as a part of star wars its really just sci-fi without them. But I could see jedi as an outside faction within this universe; maybe a jedi became stranded within the galaxy and has only been able to create a small influence.
Thatâ€™s my two cents for now <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I don't think it should dumped entirely because otherwise that allows people to create their own NPCs and give them any role of importance in the Galaxy they want. That could take the setting in a direction they want but other people disagree with, creating arguments and ultimately forcing us to decide which path is canonical. Instead, we should make sure NPCs are created with as much community input as possible, and put into place the system of inviability to protect them for continued usage.

That was certainly my thinking. There are one or two members in particular (Breeder, Alicia) who have been as keen as mustard to get Kalium up and running again. Making them Kalium Mods allows them to help drive the helm and generate interest.
> > I&amp;#39;d suggest a wiki format, but that would take the project away from the forums. May as well have all submissions take place here.

The wiki format would be easier and its doable with this site but it would require yet another registration.
Upon review, I think we might need a wiki or something like it. Initial design and debate can take place on the forums, but we need someplacewhere our finished ideas can be displayed and the material is easily navigable. A wiki gives us that, but still gives us the flexibility to easily modify something if it undergoes additional mechanical change or the fluff is affected by the stories being told.

I could be digging a bit to deep there but I'm open to suggestion. I figured having the Jedi/Sith battle of old would be a bit boring and frankly nothing NEW.
First I'll address your last point, which is quite correct: I mentioned nothing about the Sith. I'm cool with them having no place in the Kalium Galaxy. However, the setting we are proposing is a *Star Wars* setting. *Star Wars* is **all about** the Jedi and their conflict with agents of the Dark Side. We can diminish the role of Jedi, sure, and we can certainly say there are no Sith, just individual dark jedi and organisations of our own making, but to remove them entirely? I think that's a disservice to the community as a whole and is highly likely to put off a large group of potential players.
Now, the prior point: Okay, so this Galaxy isn't the Lucas Galaxy? So what? The way I see it we have two options:
1. The Galaxy is still somewhere out there in the same universe as the Lucas Galaxy. If that's the case, Kalium's Jedi may have ended up there thanks to some horribly botched hyperspace journey, or as an exploratory team who were never able to get back. In fact, since our new policy is not to worry too much about the history, calling the order "Jedi" asks a lot of questions that players might want answered, so could provide material for campaigns that explore "where DID they come from?"
2. The Galaxy is considered totally seperate. If that's the case we are saying "THIS is the canon, there's NO other Jedi order out there, just our interpretation". If so questions about why two orders from different Galaxies are so similar become moot, because we only consider our one to exist: we *may as well* steal liberally from the original source material to make our lives easier.
Or of course there's the option of settling on 2 but leaving the possibility of 1 for future development. In which case both arguments could apply.
A quick additional, looking at this from a purely mechanical point of view: I think we should aim to allow as many of the rules options as we possibly can, rather than make decisions that stifle the player's options. With that in mind, we can afford to get rid of the Jedi class (as has been said) but we certainly need to keep its talents. Since they are specifically flavoured for the Jedi order, it only makes sense we need to keep the glow-stick wielders around somewhere, and keep them similar if not identical to the Lucas interpretation. As I said, I think the thing to do is to diminish their significance to our setting rather than remove them entirely - who knows, if after a year or so no one is showing any interest in the insignificant order of the Jedi, we could probably get away with wiping them out.
> > You&amp;#39;ve actually got it a little wrong. The believers in Potentium don&amp;#39;t claim there is no good or evil, far from it: they claim the Force is inherently &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot;, and that the Dark Side is a perversion, while Jedi traditionally see the Force as having &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Evil&amp;quot; sides.

I was going of this from the Potentium wiki.
> Believers of Potentium said that the potential for light and dark sides resided in the user, not the Force itself.

That's half-right. They believe that the potential for dark side resides in the user. That being the case, the potential for light side by ignoring baser urges is definitely also within the user. But the important detail not mentioned is that they believe the Force is inherently light side.
Here's the Potentium article on wikipedia
<!-- m -->[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Potentium](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Potentium "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Potentium")<!-- m -->
From the Beliefs section:
"Counter to millennia of Jedi teachings, the followers of Potentium claimed that there was no inherent evil in viewing the Force. They claimed that what others called the light side was actually just the Force itself, which is inherently good. This was backed up by the fact that Ashla, the ancient name of the Force, came later to describe the Light Side. What others therefore called the dark side was a perversion of the Force, twisted by those who used it."

### **Rowen** (2008-05-20 18:11:36)

Okay I see you point on most things now hehe. Heres a break down list:
1. NPC creation should be kept, but we will let it be open to community suggestions and get them involved. Totally doable, and these can be derived from some of the other area's we fleshed out.
2. Having Kalium Galaxy mods would be a great idea. You mentioned Breeder (I remember how gung ho he was lol) and Alicia. Any other reccomendations for mods you guys can think of?
3. We need a wiki type format to display all the information. This can be hosted right here on this site. Im not sure how customizable skin wise it will be but its an option. We can keep the discussions here, even make a forum for submission once the galaxy is up and running.
4. I see what you mean about the Jedi, they are what makes it *Star Wars*. I do think they should take a real step back in the lime light, with no Sith EVER, lol. Just a few evil Jedi, ect. Also the galaxy does exist with the Lucas galaxy, just very very far away. (I made a funny there <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> ) In fact I had forgotten in the time line I posted a month or so ago even showed a Sith landing on one of there outter rim planets due to a hyperdrive malfunction. I don't see why it cant have happened to a light side Jedi.
5. Okay the Potentium isn't a great Idea, will stick with just the Jedi's original beliefs.

> Okay I see you point on most things now hehe. Heres a break down list:

Superb. I'm not the kind of person who needs people to agree with me all the time, but it certainly helps if we can understand what each other's positions are. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
> 1. NPC creation should be kept, but we will let it be open to community suggestions and get them involved. Totally doable, and these can be derived from some of the other area&#39;s we fleshed out.

Yep. In particular, NPCs will be very attached to organisations and species.
> 2. Having Kalium Galaxy mods would be a great idea. You mentioned Breeder (I remember how gung ho he was lol) and Alicia. Any other reccomendations for mods you guys can think of?

Other people I might recommend for the position are quite busy with real life right now. I'm thinking in particular Anazider and chibiamy. I definitely think we should offer the role to Breeder and Alicia, who have both asked after the Kalium Galaxy and have shown enthusiasm for the project. Maybe we could offer one or more additional positions that will be filled by community voting? It's a thought.
> 3. We need a wiki type format to display all the information. This can be hosted right here on this site. Im not sure how customizable skin wise it will be but its an option. We can keep the discussions here, even make a forum for submission once the galaxy is up and running.

It doesn't have to be identical to the website's format, of course. The Kalium Galaxy is a creation of the GC community but it's definitely a large enough undertaking to deserve its own design. Just as long as it's appropriate Star Warsy in and of itself, really.
> 4. I see what you mean about the Jedi, they are what makes it *Star Wars*. I do think they should take a real step back in the lime light, with no Sith EVER, lol. Just a few evil Jedi, ect.

(I made a funny there &lt;!&ndash; s:) &ndash;&gt;![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)&lt;!&ndash; s:) &ndash;&gt; ) In fact I had forgotten in the time line I posted a month or so ago even showed a Sith landing on one of there outter rim planets due to a hyperdrive malfunction. I don&#39;t see why it cant have happened to a light side Jedi.

Yep, I won't argue with this at all. Provided they are there, somewhere, no one has cause for complaint. They don't have to be powerful, and they don't have to be important.
> 5. Okay the Potentium isn&#39;t a great Idea, will stick with just the Jedi&#39;s original beliefs.

It wouldn't really make a huge difference if we used the Potentium or not, as I think I illustrated. But, if we're going with the assumption that the Kalium Galaxy is in the same setting as the Lucas Galaxy it only makes sense that the Force works the same way - it wouldn't whimisically change its own rules depending on where in space you are.
------
I think one of the next things we might want to do is agree amongst ourselves what the terms of our preservation clause will be. In fact, it seems ridiculously authoritative, but we should probably draft a full set of rules/guidelines for GMs to refer to during development of their Kalium Campaign. The only way we can be certain that the campaigns are going to be compatible and ensure the success of the shared world vision is by exercising some control even from this early stage.

Were making progress!
I think there should be some control over the creation of campaigns, if only guidelines. We can start thinking of ways to control that as we set the stage for announcing this to the community. I'm sure a few keen eyed members will notice the change to the Kalium Galaxy forum and that the only subforum in it is locked (and draw conclusions that *something*  is going on).
While I don't want to constrict anyones campaign idea's I think a few guidelines wont hurt, when it gets to that point of course. Ill post more on the idea's Ive had for that soon as well. Got a LOT moving around up there at the moment lol.
I think we are getting closer to actually opening this up though. Ill make a few more posts to get your inputs. Listing the initial post that will announce the new beginning of the Kalium Galaxy, I want it posted here before I do that. There are several other things but I'm a bit muddled atm, medicines seem to help/hinder my creative process lol.
I think were headed in the right direction and I'm getting excited again. I think this will be a LOT of fun.

Has anyone talked to Breeder and Alicia about taking of mod roles for this project?

---

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-21 14:39:27)

No. I didn't know whether Rowen wanted to let the cat out of the bag yet, or I probably would have sent them a PM.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-05-21 16:21:01)

Once I'm close to making the final announcement I'm going to PM the both of them and ask them if they would be interested in being mods for this undertaking. But not until were closer to making the announcement.

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-22 12:02:06)

I figured it would be a good thing to start drafting our rules and guidelines for various parts of the Kalium Galaxy management.
What I'm posting here is only the start, obviously, but can be taken as an example of how I'd draft the larger document.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">*Kalium Galaxy* Rules and Guidelines</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">1. Terms of Submission</span>
1. After submission you will be accredited for your work, and you will retain rights of ownership. However, your submission of material for use in the *Kalium Galaxy* shared setting is taken as consent to use, develop, and alter that material under the terms of a Creative Commons **by-nc-sa** license. Refer to clause 2.
2. The *Kalium Galaxy* and all associated content is made available for use under a Creative Commons **by-nc-sa** license. This means that others can alter and build on your work, but they must do so non-commercially and must attribute you for your work. Additionally, any derivative work must be shared under the terms of the same license. For full license details, refer to the deed at <!-- m -->[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/")<!-- m -->.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">2. Submission Rules and Guidelines</span>
1. Submitted material must be your own work, or where derived from existing material properly accredited.
2. Submitted material must be appropriate to the setting and the community. If it doesnâ€™t seem appropriate to Star Wars in general or the *Kalium Galaxy* in particular, it probably wonâ€™t get past the review board. Likewise, if the material is too adult or determined to have an agenda other than the generation of fun, it is unlikely to be accepted.
3. Submitted material should not be all â€œcrunchâ€. Statblocks and mechanics are useful but donâ€™t help the *Kalium Galaxy* to growâ€”they should always be accompanied by relevant â€œfluffâ€. For example, if submitting a new type of starfighter, you should also provide information on the company who manufactured it, the reasons for its manufacture, the purpose of key design decisions, and how the starfighter has seen use since rolling off the product lines.
4. Submitted material should not directly contradict existing *Kalium Galaxy* canon.

I like that Simply, you have a knack for the little details Ill give you that. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Very nice simply <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-22 20:30:06)

I'll take that as the okay to continue what I've started. Obviously, pass along anything you think of that needs to be spelled out somewhere. When I've got something close to a final document, I'll post it all here for you two to go over and tear apart/rebuild as necessary.

---

### **Rowen** (2008-05-22 21:01:04)

Sounds good Simply, please have at it. You are far better than me at creating such a document. Also, thank you very much for volunteering to handle it.

### **simplyscribed** (2008-05-22 22:08:33)

No worries. I quite enjoy laws and rules and other such things, they're very interesting from a linguistic point of view. Sometimes they really demonstrate the finality of meaning words can have, and other times they're great examples of how slippery words can be. So it's really no problem for me to write them: its every bit as creative an exercise as writing fiction, even if the end result isn't half as interesting to read. <!-- s;) -->![;)](https://i.ibb.co/GfkGswQC/icon-e-wink.gif)<!-- s;) -->
