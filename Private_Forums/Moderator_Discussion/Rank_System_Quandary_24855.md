# Rank System Quandary

### **Alicia** (2010-11-01 14:22:30)

There was a slight altercation in the chat today with one of our members after he discovered his post count had been decreased with the deletion of threads from his campaign thread when it was archived. He felt it was unfair that posts he had made (even if they were OOC) were deleted which subsequently affected his rank.
While the issue was resolved, it brought the question to mind to me and a couple others of whether our current variable post ranking system is actually viable in the forum.
Here's a few things I propose:
1. Remove the variable rank system as a whole. Discarding the Level 1 - 20 ranks.
2. Doing the same as above, but keeping just two ranks. One for members who have just joined but have yet to post and those who have posted at least once.
3. Keeping our current rank system, but reducing the required post counts. (The reason the counts are actually are as high as they are is because we have a few members who seem to post in quantity to games if not always in quality. As there's no real way to curve their numbers aside from deletion I raised post requirements for ranks.)
For choice three I also have this to say. It has been my goal since becoming an administrator to attempt to make the forum more friendly to other systems, not just Star Wars. I've attempted to do this by providing a more neutral look to the site, but also providing users a wide range of styles to pick from.
With that in mind, our current ranking system isn't very system neutral. I have some ideas on how to make it so by first removing the current rank images in replacing them with something more image generic. The "Levels" is very much a RP aspect so I think they'd be fine.
What do you all have to say to this?

I prefer option 1 as the only reason I ever look at the profile of new members is to make sure they're not a bot, and if they get a new title the moment they make an introductory post having a separate title is a bit redundant.
For this title, I suggest "Adventurer". It is system/genre generic, and it pays subtle homage to our community's original name, Galactic Adventures.
I have never seen a need for the rank system, to be honest. It encourages community members to post more frequently, but not necessarily to post *meaningfully*. This works for many types of forum but I would posit it isn't ideal for a roleplaying community.
Varied ranks should be to differentiate between groups, not post counts. Our Admin, Moderator, Donator, and new Game Master title all make sense. We could also have a few honorary group titles as a reward for particular contributions to the site (Game Master sets a precedent for this), as well as possibly having some for community members who've stuck with it for a certain amount of years and/or perhaps as prizes for competitions (they wouldn't necessarily have to grant any extra benefits or permissions other than the title itself).

As a personal opinion, I think we should keep the system as it is, or remove it completely. I don´t really see any need for it, but it adds a nice feel to the boards, and is useful to identify people.
Having special ranks for Moderators, Adminds, GMs and so on is very good, but otherwise I think they can be good indicators of how long a person has been in the community. Yes, in that aspect it is somewhat bad that posts vanishes when games are removed, but that makes ranks more suitable to judge how active someone has been in the other aspects of the site, of the community as a whole. Without mentioning anyone in specific, I know there are people here that has 90+ % of their posts in a game forum, pretty much never saying anything in discussions, greetings of new members, etc. Personally, I don´t think such persons should have high ranks unless they happen to be in an active game, since I don´t really feel they contribute much otherwise.
Just my thoughts.

Cast Lists, introduction threads, etc do eventually get pruned from the site so they of course are subject to reducing post counts as well.
