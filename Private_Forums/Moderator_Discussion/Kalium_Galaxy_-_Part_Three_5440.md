This describes the core worlds and their advancements. This brings everything closer to the final installment.
[hide]300 years after the first gates completion the final rings are finished. It is declared a galactic holiday in memory of Marcus Tain and his vision. The Galactic Protectorate is now an army under the Unified government and is considered by commoners as the new thugs of the galaxy. They are now in full force around the core worlds and protect the rings at all costs. The unified government now sets its sites on planets beyond the core worlds.
Several years after the completion of the rings an incident occurred. One of the galactic protectorate ships was destroyed and a ring damaged. The investigations branch found the ring to be at fault. Causing a flash back that destroyed the Protectorate ship. In truth it was a test flight and attack run by a Sith bomber/fighter squadron. They were piloted by the descendants of the new Firaxian colony from the outer rim.
It was in this same year that another anomaly occurred and sent another ship drastically close to the core worlds. Through advanced piloting skills Ara Noor, Jedi Master was able to regain control of her ship and avoid a crash landing on Hyperis, the galaxies capitol world. She was brought before the galactic government and made a representative of her home galaxy.
The next 10 years introduced the core worlds to new advances in technology. Ships with on board hyperdrives were in production and the Galactic Protectorate was being outfitted with new weapons and armor. Ara played a pivotal role in the advancement of their culture. Soon the rings would be a thing of the past and ships would be able to travel beyond the core worlds.
With several small squadrons in service Ara Noor found herself instructing the newest generation of combat pilots. Her teaching gathered many admirers and followers alike. She was able to make several close friends, those she was able to divulge her entire history to. Several showed promise in the force and were trained in secret.[/hide]
