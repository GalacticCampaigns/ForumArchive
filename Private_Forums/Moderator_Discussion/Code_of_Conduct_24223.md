# Code of Conduct

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-16 23:23:32)

There was an incident in chat today between Xychotic and myself that made Sketch PM Anazider asking whether there were grounds for booting Xy based on our Code of Conduct. Anazider then passed that information on to me.
First off, I should say straight up that there aren't any real grounds to do so and I diffused the situation quickly. However, it did get me to look around the forum for our Code of Conduct. I couldn't find it. I remember we used to have one, but it was posted on the main site. Has it been lost?
If so, that's a problem. We need one, otherwise we have nothing to base a just system of warnings and punishments on.
I'm sorry to bring this up when we already have other issues to worry about, but it seems like we should hash out a working CoC as soon as possible, especially with a few potential problem members now filtering into the community as it grows bigger.

I believe this is what your talking about. Should cover what you were talking about Simply. Scan over it and tell me what you think. That's been there since day one.

Ahh, how'd I miss that!
Nice, that gives me something to work with if anything comes up again.

And there is also the PbP Rules listed here: <!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=75](http://galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=75 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=75")<!-- m -->
I see now they need to be updated and refined.....this will give me something else to work on. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
With the inclusion of these new mods we will be cracking down more on following the rules and the '3 Strikes' your out policy. I believe there is a warning system built into phpBB3 that we can use. I'll need to check on this.

Sounds very good, Rowen. I've already witnessed 2 incidents since my return...
