# To Game or not to Game

### **master_Tru** (2012-08-25 17:03:52)

Hello Team,
I am sure we have all noticed a decline in activity within the site of late. This is unfortunate yes but this site has been around for some time and will continue on for some time longer. With that somber thought in mind I (as I am sure you all have done as well) have been thinking of ways to change that.
One of the things missing on the site is an abundance of games to play in. I have started to re-launch my game, though it is slow going. If successful it should at some point have 3 ongoing players plus a possible 2 others, a start. Which leads me to my next thought on the subject which would require the assistance of the sites Administrator, Moderators, as well as a few good GM`s.
If we had enough site interest we could launch our own DOD (Dawn of Defiance) brainstorm, which would then lead to the possible construction of our very own campaign series. We would have to work together pooling ideas and skill sets to put together something that could rival the DOD campaign as well as attract more hits to the website.
So here I am taking the first step, an important step that of seeking interest in this venture. What say you? Can you lend your support to such an endeavor?

I think the idea is interesting, and would be willing to offer my assistance. With some self-evaluation though, I can easily see that I am not yet very skilled at the long-term construction of a campaign (though I keep trying to get better), and so I think my contributions might be best if they are of a more practical nature, such as creating encounters and NPCs. I do credit myself for being a good storyteller in the short term, so fleshing out an encounter/NPC with both fluff and crunch should be no problem.
IÂ´d say it has some potential, so I think we should make some effort and see how it turns out.
