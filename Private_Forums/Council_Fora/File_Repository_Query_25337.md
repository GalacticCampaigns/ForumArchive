# File Repository Query

### **Alicia** (2013-03-12 10:24:56)

So I'm thinking of transferring over a great deal of the files I have on my site, which has actually managed to get quite a few hits due to this and my ORPG tutorials from search engines. I wanted to see what sort of ideas you all had on how this should be implemented, if at all. My goal is to perhaps remove my site completely, transferring all relevant content and integrating it into the GC.
This is the repository: <!-- m -->[http://swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com &#8230; r&amp;Itemid=5](http://swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=5 "http://swrpgrc.com/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=5")<!-- m -->
If it's transferred over, should we make these files accessible to members only? or continue as I have in the past to make it open to the public?
Any other thoughts or concerns?
