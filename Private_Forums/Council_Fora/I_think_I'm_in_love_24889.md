# I think I'm in love

LOL. Funny title aside, since Sketch pointed out the Reputation system I've been doing a bit of research into vBulletin. I think raising money for this (after our maintenance costs of course) would be my next goal.
Check it out for yourself: <!-- m -->[http://www.vbulletin.com/](http://www.vbulletin.com/ "http://www.vbulletin.com/")<!-- m -->
As an aside, there is built in support to transfer board content into the vBulletin system, however we would lose all blog content as it's a mod and not a built in feature of phpbb3, though it is one of vBulletin's features.

Hm... Purchasing and upkeep of vibulletin + hosting costs = quite a lot of moolah.
Do you think we'd realisitically have a chance of raising this kind of money?

Possibly in two years if we rely on the money from ads.
The fee you see is a one time fee. From what I've read there's no annual fee and patches are included.

The license of an owned product does *not* expire, and there is free support in terms of patches and what not, but that free support is only guaranteed for the life of the 4.x version of vbulletin (meaning that support will be discontinued once they make a version 5). You also have to pay to update your product to the new version.
So there will be upkeep costs, should we decide we want to update for any reason like new features or continuing access to support services.
