# What to do with Kalium

### **Alicia** (2010-11-12 11:56:50)

This isn't so much as a proposal as a request on opinion.
As Simply begins to get the Itara Cluster off the ground to replace Kalium Galaxy I've been trying to decide what to do with the content in the forums.
My thoughts was to consolidate it, and put it in the gamer's corner forum with the rest of the custom content.
Any other suggestions? Thoughts?

Well obviously we can't just get rid of it yet - some of it may still be useful if ported to Itara.
If we can get Itara going, we can repurpose the old Kalium forum for the job, and perhaps move all the existing threads into an Archive section until we can review what's in there and either assimilate it or delete it entirely.

Simply you said you had started the Itara Cluster already in one of your games, where is that info? If I could see what has been started I might find a way to use it in my game. Using this in my game means I would have some time to help develop it and a chance for players to experience it.

I will post that information just as soon as it's been decided where I'll post it to (dependant on whether we are going to use the old Kalium space or post in the GM forums, or some other third thing).

Might as well get this going now rather than never.
With your permission, Alicia, I'd like to take over the Kalium board and turn it into a development section for Itara, moving all the existing topics into a new archive forum where they can be referenced.
