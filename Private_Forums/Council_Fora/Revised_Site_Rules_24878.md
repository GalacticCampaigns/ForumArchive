# Revised Site Rules

### **Alicia** (2010-11-07 19:53:22)

I will be preparing in the coming days/weeks to institute a new mod which will help to expand and formalize a set of rules and policies for the site.
The mod would essentially give us rules like such: <!-- m -->[http://startrekguide.com/rules/](http://startrekguide.com/rules/ "http://startrekguide.com/rules/")<!-- m -->
Attached is what I'm proposing to become our Code of Conduct / Site Rules
Old rules - <!-- l -->[viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=76](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=76 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=76")<!-- l -->
As always, please give me your honest criticisms.

Additionally if you feel this: <!-- l -->[faq.php#f2r0](http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php#f2r0 "http://galacticcampaigns.com/forum/faq.php#f2r0")<!-- l --> may be better suited on the Site Rules I will attempt to work it in.

Well, I´ve read it through and it looks good, but I have one objection.
On point 2a it says that "arguing" is an inappropriate response when a GM rules against a player. I think this is a little bit wrong, as it gives the whole section a "shut up and accept" feel. Flaming and harassing are of course a big no-no, but I feel that I should at least have the right to argue a decision, given the fact that it could be the case that the GM has interpreted someones posted actions or the rules wrong.
I suppose most reasonable GMs won´t really do it, but I just don´t like the feel that someone could potentially just kill off someone, and then just point to the rules and say "shut up" when the player asks "wtf!!??"
Other than that it looks fine.

This all seems to remain relevant. We may want to add definitions of the various statuses (Admin, Moderator, Donator, Game Master) as well as what benefits they get/rights they have to operate around the site, along with whatever rules we eventually have in place to deal with future changes to the site and conflicts arising thereof. It makes sense to consolidate all of this information in the one place, I think.

Well the way I see it is you can debate against the GM's call - make a polite and reasoned statement explaining why you feel they may have a wrong of it and giving them your own interpretation to consider - or you can argue, which is technically the same but without the "polite and reasoned".
Also, I don't think any one would consider one or two posts trying to persuade the GM an argument, but continuing to pursue your case after the GM has told you their decision is final is both obstructive to the game and potentially abusive to the GM.
Perhaps the section could be clarified to demonstrate the difference, though.

2. Play by Post Rules
a. The Game Master (GM) is the proprietor of the game. A GM's rulings are final and arguing or flaming with the intent or result of harassment are inappropriate responses when a GM rules against a player. You may respectfully dissent with the GM's opinion and offer a polite and reasoned alternative argument, and this will not be considered arguing with the intent to harass. But once the GM has made a final decision and made it clear to you that the ruling has been made, any further attempts to pursue your cause fall under the category of harassment.

I will post a modified document once I get more feedback, but how is this?

But once the GM has made a final decision and made it clear to you that the ruling has been made, any further attempts to pursue your cause fall under the category of harassment. The Staff will only step in to resolve cases involving GM rulings should the discourse result in "flame wars", harassment or further disrupts the enjoyment of other members.

Solid.

Do you have anything specifically in mind for this?
And here's a revised file including added rules for Game Masters group and the rules for Moderators posted here in this forum. Changes are highlighted for easy reference.

I guess it comes down to how you interpret "arguing". As far as I´m concerned, once I bring up an argument to support my opinion, then I am arguing in my favor, be it polite and reasoned or not.
The new wording looks good though, so I have no further objections.

The Site Rules have been put on our own Rules Mod which I installed today. Please take a final look.
<!-- m -->[http://galacticcampaigns.com/rules/index.php](http://galacticcampaigns.com/rules/index.php "http://galacticcampaigns.com/rules/index.php")<!-- m -->
The page has the advantage of linking to a specific article by copying the link URL from the # at the end. Or you can direct to a whole section from the Rules Section. This will be useful should you ever need to direct a member to any of the rules.

On the topic of arguing ... disagreeing can quickly escalate to heated discussions, especially in the chat. I can't speak for everyone, but, for me, that drags things down. Airing out an issue is one thing, but repetitive badgering someone to get your way ends up in nothing good for everyone. Perhaps a standard/example on how one should air their grievances with a GM should be provided?
