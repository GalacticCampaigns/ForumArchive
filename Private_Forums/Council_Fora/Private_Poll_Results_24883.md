# Private Poll Results

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-11 15:08:24)

**Proposal Summary:** Sets Poll results to be hidden to a user until they themselves have voted.
**Proposal Declaration:** another MOD I just found while looking for something entirely different. Finding was not solicited by anyone or caused by any particular trigger, but I think it could be a useful (if minor) addition.
**Potential Benefits/Consequences:** Firstly, it helps preserve a voter's neutrality in a poll. Currently, if they want to vote for C but option A and B are both more popular with A apparently winning by several posts, the user may vote for B just because it seems the lesser of two evils to them. With the results blocked to them, they (and others like them) are more likely to vote with their first instinct, C, giving that option a chance to catch up. Even if A (or B) still win, we have a more accurate idea of who actually thought what, and that's useful data to have.
Secondly, it may help prevent political voting *as well as* prevent losing parties from voicing suspicions and accusations of political voting. Under this system, you can't simply see which way the wind is blowing and cast your vote. If a user actually wanted to cast their vote out of some sense of loyalty to a group or cause rather than expressing their personal opinion, they would have to network with other people to find out which way to vote. Some people might do that, so it's not foolproof, but it's a first line of defence at least. I know if someone actually came out and asked me to vote a certain way, I'd say no: my right to my own opinion is too important.

While this could be a useful addition, I'm going to have to point out that the support thread has this as an unstable mod and as it was made for 3.0.1 it may not be compatible with our current board system.
