I'm of the mind to start up the weekly discussions threads that Rowen once attempted, but as I have only a few ideas on what the topics could be I'm looking for some input from the peanut gallery. As I'm thinking of making this a semi-weekly to monthly thing then not as many will be needy a month.
Some of these ideas I know have probably been ripped to shreds on the WOTC forum, but maybe we can get some fresh ideas on them here.
 **Kinetic Combat** - How it works in regards to combat, is it worth the cost to make it ultimately effective.
**Armor in saga vs Armor in RCR** - Armor talents (should Imperial Knight talent be available to soldiers), how effective is it really?

I think it sounds like a good idea. I love having those threads to discuss and philosophize in.

Integrated weapons
Weapon mounts - just for ranged weapons?
