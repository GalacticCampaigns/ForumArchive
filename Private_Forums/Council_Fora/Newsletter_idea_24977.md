# Newsletter idea

### **Alicia** (2011-02-05 12:52:20)

**Proposal Summary:**I've been trying to think of ways of getting the community more involved and more aware of things happening around the site and the idea of writing up a newsletter monthly or bi-monthly came to mind.
Here's some things I came up with which may be beneficial in a newsletter:

Site news (includes site updates, anticipated downtime, etc)
Games currently recruiting (We may wish to encourage GMs to post a small summary blurp in their casting calls for this purpose.)
Featured PbP tip (these can be taken from our current list until other members begin writing their own additions, then they can be featured.)
Member feature (in line to our meet the team thread in the introduction forum only it would feature a member of the community.
The mod I'm looking at would send the newsletters via e-mail and also store them on the site as an archive. With the mod, separate newsletters for specific to groups could be created as well.
**Potential Benefits/Consequences:** More community interaction and knowledge of the site events.

Thoughts?

I like the idea.
And in addition to games recruiting, active games could have someone write up a summary of what happened over the last month or two. I use summary loosely, as the material could simply be a single scene. Anyway, it's an idea.

That is an idea, though it's up to GMs to get the write up done.
I've sent out PMs to all GMs for a casting call summary.
I'm aiming to have the first newsletter ready for the end of February to post for March.

This is a pretty cool idea, I think. They would only have to be semi-regular.

Why I was think bi monthly unless we get good responses from it.
