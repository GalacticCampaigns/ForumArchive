# Planet Template

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-13 18:05:30)

When submitting ideas for planets, or additions to existing planets, use the following template.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE RULES</span>

* "[Text]" indicates you should replace "[Text]" with the appropriate information. For instance if your species is called the Je'kor and the template says "[Species Name]", replace "[Species Name]" with "Je'kor".
* Although I have included an "Era" entry in the templates, we want all our initial material to be playable in the same era. Since the setting was originally developed for use in Legacy, it makes sense to design for Legacy first then work back. Put "Legacy" for now.

<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">PLANET TEMPLATE</span>
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">[PLANET NAME]</span>
Descriptive section, including:

* A one paragraph summary of the planet. This section should capture the essence of the planet, encapsulating all that would make it exciting for a character to take.
* A brief history of the planet. This section should be at least 2 paragraphs long, and kept under 5 (you will have the opportunity to expand on it later if the planet passes review).

**Region:** what part of space is the planet located? Core/Rim/etc.
**Climate:**  what is the primary climate of the planet?
