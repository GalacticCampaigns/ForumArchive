<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">SALCU</span>
*Pronounced: Sarl-soo*
2nd planet from the system's sun, Salcu's make-up is about 40% ocean and 60% landmass. The land is primarily plainsland and savannas, broken up by occasional craggy foothills and mountains. Forests are rare and sparsely populated.
A large area encircling the planet, known as the Band, periodically suffers extreme physical stress as a result of the migrations of titanic burrowing arthropods known as Sluuvath. The resultant earth movement means that this land is the most fertile on the planet.
Apart from brave frontier farm owners, the planet's sentient population chiefly dwells in several large walled settlements, the better to protect citizens from fearsome predators, particularly the Salcuan crag lions. The largest such settlement is the capital city, Tras, from where the Salcuan Planetary Government coordinate the general running of the entire planet.

<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Customs of Salcu</span>
Every year, the citizens of Salcu celebrate the Festival of Remembrances in Tras. It began shortly after the original settlers first fell victim to the then unknown phenomenon of the Sluuvath migration as a way to commemorate those who died in the catastrophe. Over the years it has become bigger than that, an occasion when citizens grieve for all those they have lost during the last year. Like any large holiday it has become quite commercial, with the gitft industry seizing on the opportunity to produce memorial wreaths and message tokens intended to be burnt on the pyres and carry well wishes to the dead.

The planet Salcu is rich in wildlife.
**Crag Lions**
Type: Carnivorous mammal
Salcuan Crag Lions are the most fearsome predators on the planet, and possibly even within the Itara System. This is due to their size, speed, ferocity, and their tendency to act in packs known as prides.
At infancy, a crag lion is already an equivalent size to the average Human male. They grow to full size over the space of three years. A young adult is large enough to take down a landspeeder: examples of which have been documented! Some fully grown specimens are more easily compared to an AT-ST or similar sized walker, in mass if not in height. A crag lion has a lithe, muscular body, two tails, and soft sandstone-coloured fur. Males have impressive manes, and examples of both sexes have four sets of whiskers, two to each side of their broad heads.
Crag lions hunt in the foothills and abundant plainslands of Salcu. Sometimes loners also move into the mountains, driven from their normal territory by a pride that has abandoned them. They primarily prey on the planet's wildlife, particularly the large troden, which make for a sizeable and typically easily caught meal. They will attack travellers in the wilderness, and have even been known to descend on settlements.
Crag lions operate in packs under the dominion of the most powerful male. Male and female, young and old alike take part in the hunt, working with pack tactics. Combined with their natural power and speed, it is this ability to work together that makes crag lions a danger even to heavily armed convoys.
**Herynn**
Type: Avian
Herynn are tall birds that dwell around the rivers and lakes of Salcu. Though their preferred diet is made up of vegetable matter and fish, they are not averse to red meat when they can get it, and have occasionally even been known to attack sentient beings when hungry enough. They are as large as a wookie, and quite capable of breaking bones with a beat of their powerful wings. Their talons are large enough to crush a human's skull with ease.
Incidents of Herynn attacks on sentients are thankfully rare, and the creatures are admired for the beauty of their red plumage and their innate elegance whether on the ground or in flight.
**Sluuvath**
Type: Arthropod
The sluuvath are titanic burrowing arthropods that dwell under the surface of Salcu. They spend years at a time in hibernation, then burrow through the earth part-way round the planet in the region now known as the Band. In doing so, they cause violent tremors that destroy settlements, end lives, and churn the soil: this last ensures that the Band comprises the most fertile land on Salcu, which causes settlers to continue risking the threat of sluuvath Migrations and crag lion attacks.
**Troden**
Type: Herbivorous mammal
The large six-legged herd beasts known as Troden swarm the plains of Salcu and are favourite prey for the planet's predators, such as Crag Lions, packs of which often follow Troden herds for months, picking off stragglers; and the Herynn, which are not above eating carrion.
Troden are almost pure muscle and have impressive proportional strength making them valuable as beasts of burden in areas where technology cannot easily reach. Their meat is considered a delicacy and is often a feature of gourmet menus in the Cluster.
Troden are not naturally aggressive but become so when the herd is in danger. *No one* wants to be in front of a herd of raging Troden. It is particularly hard to capture and train female Troden that have birthed.
