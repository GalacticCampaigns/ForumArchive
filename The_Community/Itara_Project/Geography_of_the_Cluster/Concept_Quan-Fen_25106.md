Beneath the sulfuric clouds of industry and protective layers of mists born from terraforming lie hundreds of manufacturing colonies, thousands of labor unions, and hundreds of thousands of criminal syndicates. Qun-Fen’s craggy surface now supports a rough, if breathable atmosphere, and its once frozen, barren islands are dotted with bulk processing plants, manifesting centers, and efficient housing. Useless soil hardened by frost now support industrious centers for crafting everything from space ship parts to textiles and basic food stuffs. And intermixed it with all are the unions, governments, and criminal organizations that influence the world and its products. Qun-Fen is a world filled with movement on top of frozen fields, in the terms of industry, politics, and contraband.
While Quan-Fen is officially a water-world, its distance from the sun and the thick cloud layers keep the temperature well below that of freezing, and its seas are topped by hundreds of feet of solid ice. The hundreds of thousands of islands are the tops of rough mountains that whose bases start miles beneath the surface ice. The harsh winds of the surface have failed to wear the cliffs and sharp edges of the islands down, resigned only to coat the impenetrable rock with thick layers of ice. Miles beneath the icy surface the sea is still fluid, if a thick sludge of primordial ooze with its own life that is incompatible with any top dwelling creature. Terraforming has transformed the atmosphere into a breathable substance, but hundreds of years of effort have touched the inhospitable seas under the ice, or have even swayed the frozen fury of the surface.
Heavy industrial plants grapple the islands, where the heat of their furnaces won’t melt the ice under them while smaller plants struggle to maintain a balance of productivity versus melting their foundations. Starship yards and durasteel plants work along the equator of the planet, making use of the fallen space elevator both to block the wind and for spare parts. Smaller factories requiring less heat, such as food processers and textile plants, clump around the industrial giants, forming communities and cities that can span a hundred miles across and fifty floors down. Travel between the cities is handled through air powered ships that skate across the ice when traveling with the wind, and under-ice tunnels with ground crawling transports- such as trains and wheeled vehicles- when not.
The only thing more deadly and unrelenting than the weather on Quan-Fen is the politics. Instead of a single voice to speak for the planet, Quan-Fen host no less than six sectors, each with their own capital city, Baron, taxes, laws, and criminal influence. Each Sector Barren is elected by a council of peers drawn from the most influential- not necessarily most legal- and is expected to put their supporters concerns first. These council members- made up of business owners, crime lords, and survivors of a Hutt passenger liner that crashed on the planet just as terraforming started- have clients and partners of their own, each with their own agenda. The complex and Malkavian politics cause a constant shift of power across the world. Visitors are advised to tread lightly, least they walk on the toes of one with the ear of the Sector Baron.
With its harsh weather and unforgiving politics, Quan-Fen is, on the icy surface, an unpleasant world. But the cheap industry and open trade policies attract workers, traders, engineers, and wanders from across the sector. Quan-Fen is where everything can be bought and sold as long as the proper taxes are paid, anyone can find work, and where histories from off-world are forgotten. If the harsh winds and rocky earth don’t break you, and the politics don’t cripple you, a place can be found under the wing of a crime lord, in a Union, or in any other organization that exists on the harsh planet. And if you last out five years, you gain the title of Citizen of Quan-Fen, a label recognized across the sector for toughness, work ethic, and knowing when to keep one’s mouth shut.

**DC / Result**
10 / The Sector Barons have unlimited power in their sectors, but each one answers to a dozen or more important figures inside their sectors.
15 / “The biggest crime bosses are the Hutts- survivors of a starship that crashed here right as the terraforming started. Get in with them, and even the Sector Barons can’t touch you.”
20 /” While the Sector Barons can command anything inside their territory, they can’t touch you if you make it to another Sector. Intruding on another Sector is a big ‘no-no’, even under the radar.”

**DC / Result**
10 / “There’s nothing illegal here, but the taxes can be so high they might as well be.”
15 / “Everyone is polite, but don’t mistake that as being nice. There’s a tax on being rude, but not for handing you your teeth, so long as you apologize afterward.”
20 / “Union fees can be expensive, but the tax for remaining independent is steeper. However, there is a lot of business to be had for anyone willing to work for anyone.”

**DC / Result**
10 / “Sure, there’s water under the ice, if you go down deep enough. But it’s poisonous and you can’t eat anything that grows in it.”
15 / “Before the terraforming started, there wasn’t anything alive on the surface. But now we got rats, taun-tauns, big wooly banthas, ganjukos, fwits, ice modrols, and lots others. “
20 / “There’s something about that ooze down there that no one wants to mess with. Force Users stay up here on the surface, and they’re not allowed to travel to the research stations that have drilled down to the seas. Force Users that have gone down…haven’t come back up.”
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">The Hutts- Knowledge [Social Sciences]</span>
**DC / Result**
5 / The Hutts all came from some passenger liner that crashed here a long time ago.
10/ There is a “nonaggression” pact between the Hutts. They can outwit and outsmart each other, but they won’t attack each other. They won’t even let someone else kill another Hutt. This doesn’t apply to an Hutt that pays a visit though- those slugs are fair game.”
15 / “The Hutts here today are direct descendants of the crash survivors. But- and you didn’t hear this from me- but a few are who aren’t the descendants, but are the actual survivors. You ever heard of anything living that long?”
20 / “The Hutts didn’t crash here by accident; they were running from something. What it is, I don’t know, but whatever it is, the Hutts thought trying to live here was a better idea than facing it.”
25/ “Whatever convinced the Hutts to crash here is still around. Those slugs are still preparing for when it arrives. They are stock piling guns, war droids, and explosives. There’s even one Hutt who is carbon freezing mercenaries to fight for him when the time comes.”
30 / “The ancient Hutts- the old ones who survived the crash and are still alive today, they’re not like all the other ones. They’ve changed. Evolved. Or regressed. I don’t know, but they’re nit fat slugs anymore. I wouldn’t want to see them again without an army at my back. Or maybe in front of me.”
