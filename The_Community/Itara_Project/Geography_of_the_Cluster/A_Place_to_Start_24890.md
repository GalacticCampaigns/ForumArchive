# A Place to Start

### **simplyscribed** (2010-11-13 18:01:15)

I want us to have a firm grasp on what the Cluster actually **is** and what is actually **there** before we expand outward. To that end, I propose we begin with the geography of the Cluster.
Here is what we know about the Cluster so far, from it's early development as the backdrop for *Ripples in the Deep*. Please note that when I wrote up this information, it was on the assumption that the info had to be relevant during the Legacy Era.
<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">The Itara Cluster</span>
The Itara Cluster is a grouping of several hundred closely arranged stars located near the edge of the Deep Core. Most of these are so close to each other that their systems are uninhabitable and often dangerous. The arrangement also protects the central systems, which are stable and inhabited, from easy access via hyperspace travel. There is a single hyperspace lane, which only opens intermittently under the waxing and waning influence of a dying star. Even the most capable algorithms only correctly predict the lane's access times with about sixty percent accuracy, so very little traffic ever passes in or out of the cluster.
The cluster's inhabitable central systems were discovered in the waning days of the Old Republic, though colonisation efforts were slow. After Palpatine's take over, the Empire subjugated the small populaces of the cluster, valuing its privacy and security. Though nothing on the scale of the Death Star or Sun Crusher was ever built there, several research and development facilities within the cluster were responsible for providing the Emperor with some of his most devastating weapons.
The New Republic never came to the cluster, and Imperial government thrived there even after Pellaeon's and the Empire's surrender. The governors lost interest in pursuing Imperial agendas once the news reached them, however, and within the next decade had largely been replaced by more democratic governments. Some fought to keep control but most willingly resigned, retiring into obscurity.
In 137 ABY, the cluster's worlds have long since become independently governed and self-sustaining. They export little of real worth, a fact that puts them low on the Sith Empire's priorities. Several Imperial facilities still exist, however, that if converted to new functions could be put to use by the Sith Empire or another faction. It may take them decades to turn their attention to this unimportant collection of worlds, but the time must eventually come.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Inhabited Systems</span>
There are three inhabited systems within the Itara Cluster, plus the dangerous area known as Cluster’s Edge.
<span style="font-size: 1.30em;">Central system</span>
This system is the most easily reached of all the Cluster’s systems through the unreliable hyperspace corridor between the Cluster and the larger Galaxy. Though officially named the Itara System, most citizens prefer a less confusing name given "Itara" also names the Cluster itself as well as a planet within the system. “Central System” has become an acceptable alternative, sometimes even used on official documents.
The Central System comprises seven planets grouped around a single star. Three of those planets are inhabited.
**ITARA**
*Pronounced: It-ah-Ra*
3rd planet from the system's sun, Itara is chiefly covered by stormy oceans and small islands. The largest landmasses are around the planet's equator, and it is on these storm-drenched shores that the City is built. The City covers almost every inch of available real estate on Itara, and is broken up into a number of smaller Districts which are in turn divided into Sections. Most Sections are residential with enough businesses to support the local community. However, some are entirely commercial, industrial, or otherwise specialised. One such example is the Administrative Section in District 1, where Itara's planetary government is based.
**SALCU**
*Pronounced: Sarl-soo*
2nd planet from the system's sun, Salcu's make-up is about 40% ocean and 60% landmass. The land is primarily plainsland and savannas, broken up by occasional craggy foothills and mountains. Forests are rare and sparsely populated.
A large area encircling the planet, known as the Band, periodically suffers extreme physical stress as a result of the migrations of titanic burrowing arthropods known as Sluuvath. The resultant earth movement means that this land is the most fertile on the planet.
Apart from brave frontier farm owners, the planet's sentient population chiefly dwells in several large walled settlements, the better to protect citizens from fearsome predators, particularly the Salcuan crag lions. The largest such settlement is the capital city, Tras, from where the Salcuan Planetary Government coordinate the general running of the entire planet.
**TALLETLE**
*Pronounced: Tal-ee-tool*
Though the 5th furthest planet from the system's sun, Talletle is far drier than Itara or Salcu. Positively arid, in fact. Its relative distance from the star does mean that it is not too hot, however, and despite the inherent difficulties of survival on a desert planet Talletle's citizens are relatively comfortable.
Talletle is chiefly known throughout the Cluster for its elaborate racing circuits, which see numerous types of vehicle face off against others of their kind (and occasionally each other) among the wind-tunnel canyons and across the still dunes. Speedfreaks from all over the Cluster and beyond find their way to Talletle to take part in the races and earn fame and fortune, not to mention experience the thrill of gunning the repulsor engines way beyond the limitis recommended by their manufacturer.
<span style="font-size: 1.30em;">Pale Star system</span>
The Pale Star System's sun has seen brighter days, and the light it produces is somewhat weak. It is still not recommended to stare at it, however.
There are 13 worlds in the system, five of which are inhabited by sentient beings.
**EBAIWOR**
*Pronounced: Eh-by-war* 
4th planet from the system's sun, Ebaiwor itself is an unstable volcanic world unsuitable for habitation. Its two jungle moons Ebaiwor Primo and Secundo, however, share a tropical climate that makes them infinitely more pleasant to dwell upon. The economoy of Ebaiwor is primarily built upon mining Ebaiworan flame rubies from within the superheated innards of the planet. Teshi Mining Concern and Balora Industries control the majority of this business between them, and as such they are also powerful forces of political influence on Ebaiwor.
**VEVAL**
*Pronounced: Vee-varl* 
5th planet from the system's sun, Veval is a terrestrial water world. It is primarily occupied by representatives of water-dwelling and amphibious species, though boasts one city, Tasem, that is built as much above the water as it is under it.
Archaeologists have discovered evidence of previous settlers or a native species by way of carvings and apparently sentient-made structures on the sea bed. It is increasingly less likely by the day that the civilisation that created these still exists, however, as vast portions of the oceanic world are now being scouted.
**THESBAED**
*Pronounced: Fay-es-bye-ed* 
Profile in development.
**LONHIADE**
*Pronounced: Lon-he-ah-duh* 
Profile in development.
**QUASRE**
*Pronounced: Kwas-ray* 
12th planet from the system's sun, Quasre is a cold world. Even its most temperate zones around the planet's equator are snow fields, and its weather conditions are progressively worse the closer to its poles you travel. It is in these inhospitable climes, however, that the greatest sights are to be found: huge snow build-ups and great wind-sculpted ice formations form natural mazes with jagged mountains in their midst.
The snowy planet is also home to a sentient species. The Quasrene, who were discovered only during the period of Imperial control, were treated as second class citizens despite being the Cluster's only known natives. One of the effects of the Empire's downfall in the region was to put them in a position of new-found political significance. The Quasrene capital Xien is built in a great ice cavern, constructed across its floor, its ceiling, and its walls.
<span style="font-size: 1.30em;">Unnamed Third System</span>
Profile in development.
<span style="font-size: 1.30em;">Cluster&#39;s Edge</span>
The Cluster's Edge is not strictly a system but rather a nebulous region encircling the three occupied systems considered too close to the packed stars around for safe occupation. Despite this several colonies exist among the asteroids and worlds within Cluster's Edge, and these operate with a certain amount of autonomy from the governing bodies of the cluster.
The Cluster's Edge is also host to the popular race, the Cluster Thruster.
