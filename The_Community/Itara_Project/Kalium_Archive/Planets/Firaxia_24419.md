A planet with rolling farmland and forest. Know for it Star ship building as well as it sea side Hamlets and villages. The people of Firaxia have been sailors and fisherman for most of the planets history. So it was only natural that they became great pilots and navigators to the stars.
The planet has 4 major land masses and 3 major city Firaxia City the capital and planetary government seat. Solar major seaside resort and shipping docks. Firaxia has orbiting shipyards and docks, Factory's and defence stations.
Planetary government is ruled by House Jordan. The house controls all shipping and defense of planetary interest on and off planet.
Honor and pride mean everything to the people of this planet. The Cruisers and transport ships produced on Firaxia are highly sought after by others in the Galaxy.
Firaxia City is a large metropolitan area that covers a large part of one of the major continents and can be seen form orbit.
This is the home of main planetary security forces. Large amount of smuggling and smugglers centered here this been outlawed by the house but the pride and independent nature of the people make it hard to get rid of.
Climate is mild and temperate,with plenty of rain and a longer growing seasons great for farming. Winters are short but cold and hard especially in the mountains.
I am going to work on this planet created by Raptor. I hope this is ok with everyone.

The Fifth Age, the Galaxy has split. The Firaxia system, 4 sectors of space ruled by Duke Christopher Jordan "The Just". He governs his people fairly and he has brought wealth and influence to his Kingdom. The ship yards are busy building ships of all kinds. Trade with neighboring governments is going smoothly and the Force users are kept in check. After the split Force users are not trusted in his realm. They are regulated and expected to register so that they can be monitored and trained by the Duke's Royal guards. They serve him and the throne of House Jordan. Each one is considered the same and given the same armor and weapons. They act as his guard and his eyes and ears through out his kingdom. They are not aloud to have any other station in life they unless the come from royal blood. Christopher is himself a Force user, as his father was and his son is. Of course this was not always the case. Force users only go back a few generation in his family. His people are happy and there for he is happy.
Firaxia's Ship yards are some of the best in the Galaxy. There ships are sought after be most of the governments around and at one time most of the Galactic government's Navy was built by the ship yards here. The Naval Academies here turn out the best navigators and pilots around. For anyone outside the Kingdom to get excepted into the Academy is a great privilege, cause it happens little.
Pathfinder Firaxian heavy cursor. (Star Destroyer size vessel.)
Banshe Fighter. Designed as a main attack fighter. ( kind of like a Basilisk Star Fighter ((Mando)) ).
Will add more later.

It's a good start. When you get the chance, format it to follow the standard planet formatting used in Saga. That alone will improve its look a whole bunch and fill in a few details you missed.
Also, if the Firaxian government is large enough, you could make it into a faction--you already have several of the pieces you need for that (Force users, government, and ships).

It might just be me, but I think a system government should not be a Faction. I just want to avoid having a huge amount of factions to keep track of. Think about it, in the Lucas-verse, how many factions would you say there exists in the Galaxy? Quite a few less than the number of systems, right?
Just my thoughts, but I think if the only thing a faction contains is info on a planetary government or a single system, it should not be a faction.

I rather agree with Thrax, that the planetary government f a single planet shouldn't be considered a Faction. Now if that planet was a sector capital, or a regional trading hub, then it would have influence beyond the single planet and would probably qualify.

Yeah, I guess that would be too many. I was thinking he said four sectors, though its only one system.

I think maybe a good example could be Mandalorians. They are clearly a Faction in the Galaxy (albeit a small one), but this doesnÂ´t make the government of Mandalore (the sector) a Faction in itself, even though this is pretty much what the Mandalorians are, except for scattered bounty hunters and mercenaries.
