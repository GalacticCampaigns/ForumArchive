15 Jherit is a somewhat new world in the galactic community, mostly because colonization has only recently succeeded.
20 While Jherit has no capital, Doata is its most popular and most inhabited city.
25 Jherit has no central government, as the multiple colonization attempts have created a few different colony cities.
30 Jherit has an indigenous species, the Lasani, which have recently learned how to use scrap technology left by colonists to make their own devices and weapons.

15 Doata is well known for its black market economy and increasingly powerful criminal underworld.
20 Doata is the site the transaction of millions of credits per day, often for the sale of weapons, narcotics, and other illegal items.
25 Crime is so meshed in Doataâ€™s society that removing it could crash its economy. Â¬
Jherit is inhabited by mostly poor locals who are farmers, yet there is a growing industrial sector in the larger spaceport cities of the planet. The majority of the population is human, although there are a high percentage of alien races now, and there are rumors of an indigenous race that thrive and live in the desert wastelands. But not much is yet know of this race. The planet has been the site of repeated attempts at colonization, but most recently due to advancing technology it seems that the colonization is taking hold. Because of this now Jherit has several sizable cities, the largest of which is the free spaceport city of Doata, known for its insidious criminal underworld. Notable geological features include the Great Sea of Sand, an enormous desert which covers a large area of land, and the vast mountain range of Moradin Ka, which borders the desert. Jherit has three moons visible in the night sky, Asori which is the largest of the three, Luha slightly smaller, and Ryra which shines with a reddish glow.
