Rahasia is an planetoid with many deep cliffs and crevices, many stretching deep into the crust of the planetoid. Rahasia used to be an advanced factory and starship building planetoid, with all the raw materials that were on the planet. It was a site of a battle during the Great War though, where a faction dumped thousands of pounds of toxins into the atmosphere, killing all those on the planet. Due to the planet no longer being suitable to hold life, it was abandoned and forgotten by all except a few smugglers who used the base as a hideout. The Reaping, needing a secret base to stage their operations, found Rahasia, with many of its factories and shipyards still intact, and created an advanced shadowport there. Deciding to tell a very few amount of infochants and smugglers, to acquire supplies and information and holding them to secrecy at the threat of death, Rahasia is still an unknown world.
