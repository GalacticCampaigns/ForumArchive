Bandor is a frigid planet; a wasteland of ice, snow, and blisteringly cold winds. It is only hospitable thanks to the stubborn colonization efforts of early Zabrak settlers (who arrived the hard way, before the advent of hyperspace travel, and had to do the best they could with the planet they had found). Its cities are all underground where they are less affected by the extreme environment, and their heat is carefully regulated by powerful computer systems. A whole industry has developed around the maintenance of these computers, since their failure would be a disaster. Bandor also has a native race, once primitive but changed through long contact with galactic citizens since the original settlers. Were it not a Core World, Bandor would probably not have developed since its humble beginnings. As it is, however, industry and developers could only ignore Bandor in favor of more hospitable Core planets for so long; where other Core planets were becoming crowded, Bandor was still largely undeveloped. These days, Bandor is primarily an industrial planet, and its citizens are largely there because their job requires it. The exception are wealthy aristocrat and merchant families, who have taken to building holiday homes on the planet's surface, elaborate ice palaces that cost several small fortunes. The individual who first patented the concept, Genath Ols, went on to invest in exotic housing projects throughout the Core and Ols Industries eventually branched into other fields such as starship design. Today, Ols Industries is still a known name throughout the Galaxy.
