One of the first planets to discover hyperdrive technology, Zabraks quickly spread through the galaxy. Thanks to this, Tizan has become a very popular planet, and many businesses have put headquarters on the planet. Even a few military training centers have been created on the planet, most of them created after the Great War. Tizan, while predominately Zabrak, has many other species living on the planet.
