The planet Nichet has two continents and numerous island chains, covering roughly 40% of the planets surface area. The planets only major spaceport is located in the capital city of Royal, howeverpublic transit makes transportation to the other settlement simply.
Roughly 29% of the planets population is employed by the Nichet Royal Shipworks. The Shipworks primary construction facilities are located on the surface of the closest moon, Ralak, and is one of the primary ship suppliers for the region.
The complex system of advisers and councils that govern the day to day operation of the planet would have led to a high degree of corruption in any other culture, however several factors prevent this from being the case on Nichet. First is that many people have been raised with a strong sense of responsibility and personal honor, (Nichet has a tradition of dueling) that doesn't allow for placing the safty of others at risk. The Second is the Runes, the group of force sensitive women who also serve as royal bodyguards, who swear loyalty directly to the Royal Family.

What makes this planet special? What is so unique about it that I want to take a campaign there? There are several places you almost got there (with the immense bureaucracy, the dueling, or the Runes, for example) but nothing really jumped out.
Also, were you going to do a skill chart for it too? You know, the list of skills like Knowledge (Life Sciences) or (Galactic Lore)?
Overall, though, I think its a great start.

Am I getting too far off if I try to visualize this planet as somewhat similar to Naboo?

No your not. Even as I wrote this up, I was seeing the similarity with Naboo. I'm working on submissions for other area's that will help develop Nichet, so its not just Naboo by another name so to speak.

OK, good, then my mind wasnÂ´t wandering off. It tends to do that sometimes <!-- s:lol: -->![:lol:](https://i.ibb.co/4wBjw6T4/icon-lol.gif)<!-- s:lol: -->
