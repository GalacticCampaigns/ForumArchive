# Huran IV

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-07-20 21:52:15)

**Name:** Huran IV
**Descriptor:** City World, Poor
**System:** Huran System
**Sector:** Outer Core
**Moons:** Pyberius, Dyterius, and Grypherius
**Major Imports:** Processed Raw Materials (woods, smelted steel, raw plastic, etc)
**Major Exports:** Consumer Goods
**Population:** 6 trillion sentient creatures (45% Humanoid, 15% Near-Human, 40% non-Humanoid)
                          (Pyberius)     Uninhabited
                          (Dyterius)     4,000 sentient creatures (methane breathers)
                          (Grypherius) 921 billion sentient inmates (prison moon)
**Terrain** 
    Fauna- According to Interplanetary Center for Non-Sentient Biological Diversity (ICNBD ), no native organism on Huran IV above microscopic level can claim â€œnativeâ€™ status; what was not hunted into extinction was killed by pollution and other by products of over-population.  Due to the crowded nature of the small world (roughly 10,000 sentient creatures per square kilometer ), there are few places for large creatures to survive.
Rodents, scavengers, and insects still flourish, despite every effort of the residents of Huran IV put forth.  Creatures of special note are the smog lizards, the Huran snakes, glow spiders, Huran rats, and raptors.
*Smog lizards* are the massive creatures that swim in the undercity oceans, water ways, and have even made their way into the public water reservoirs of the mid to lower levels.  Suspected of being reptiles, it is hypothesized the 40 meter plus beast actual consume pollution and non-biodegradable materials; any water they swim in has a significantly reduced amount of pollutants.  However, they also a frighteningly hard to catch, near impossible to hold, and wickedly deadly.  Thus far, one century since their discovery, smog lizards are blamed for the deaths of every team that attempted to capture, sample, or otherwise detain the monsters.
Huran IV have as many varieties of snakes as any planet.  What makes *Huran snakes* special is their poisonous skin.  Every discovered species of Huran snake sweats a paralyzing liquid of varying potency.  The Huran cobra's causes mild numbness in the touched area (where as it's spitting poison can cause permanent blindness) while the massive Huran boa's poison can cause a full grown man to collapse in seconds, and stay that way through the four hours it will take the boa to fully consume him.  Medical facilities pay for the live capture of Huran snakes.
*Glow spiders* are one few species that are encouraged to grow and repopulate on this massive city planet.  Each one emits a soft glow when moving, a warning to potential predators of their toxicity.  When close to another of their own kind, the glow brightens, to the point a dozen can illuminate a small room.  The trick to keep them moving.  In that regard, slender glass tubes can line a hallway.  As a creature walks down the hall, pressure on the floor plates cause the tubes to rotate, forcing the spiders to move, and the hall is illuminated.  This cheap form of lighting is common in the lower levels, as the upper levels- home of the richer inhabitants, have better things to do besides feed insects to spider filled tubes.
*'Tougher than a Huran rat'* is a common phrase used by visitors of city planet.  The *Huran rats* of the planet are known for being about to take a rifle round, and still be able to crawl away to heal.  They can breathe underwater, are immune to nearly every poison known, can eat nearly anything, and have no issues surviving Huran IV's toxic atmosphere.  Their fur is energy and flame retardant, and their bodies contain a series of extra, redundant organs.  Literally the cockroaches of Huran IV, it seems impossible to kill every last one...though citizens of the planet keep trying.
Huran Raptors are not native, despite the name.  Instead, over a thousand of these massive reptiles were housed in an Elites purpose built aerie.  For some unknown reason, the Elite released the winged beasts shortly before his death, sending them out to make their own way in the city world. Instead of dying out, the raptors thrived, even growing in size and majesty.  Oddly enough, capturing them has proved difficult to law enforcement and naturalist, but the street urchins and gangs of Huran IV have quite a collection spread out between them.
    Flora- Like the fauna of the planet, the ICNBD has declared all native flora on extinct on Huran IV. Only imported plants and mold- shipped in on purpose or by accident- remain.  Several types mold, lichen, and algae are grown in vast greenhouses to provide food stuff for the planets crowded masses, adjusting the taste and texture depending on the price the consumer is willing to pay.  Other plants, such as trees, grass, and bushes, are luxuries of the rich, who can afford sunlight bathed towers.
Of special note, carnivorous plants are, with the proper permits, legal on Huran IV, and such plants are favored by the wealthy as a form of home defense.
**Society**
    General Population- One of the most heavily populated planets in the galaxy, Huran IV's is a study of mixture and seclusion.  On one hand, the mid to lower population is made of every sentient and near sentient species in the known galaxy (and more than a few from unknown parts of the galaxy). Reptiles work and play side by side to avian humanoids and near humans.  Sentient fauna speak with equal weight as sentient insects, and droids of all makes can be found filling innumerable roles. Human Rights activists are next door neighbors to their barratok counter parts, while an organization of twi'liks are forming yet another civil rights terrorist group, and a shawda ubb have joined the committee to for more species integration.  
    On the other hand, those of wealth- referred to as the Elite- live miles above their impoverish kin, never interacting save through middlemen and messengers.  There are levels of Huran IV inaccessible save by the air, and at least one section- the series of mansion sized apartments of an ancient eccentric- is buried so deep within the city crust- that can't be reached at all.  The separation wealthy so highly prize and pay for is easily understood; on a planets of 6 trillion, privacy is the most costly luxury available.
Employment- Huran IV boasts one of the best employment rates in the sector- only 5% of the world's population is of working age and without a job.  That's still still 3 billion unemployed.  Should anyone attempt to count those individuals who do not appear on the yearly census, the number would be nearly ten times that.  Despite the massive number of employed sentients, there is no shortage of jobs for those willing to work.
Most of those who do hold legitimate jobs can be found planets factories, turning processed materials into usable goods.  Most of these goods are too expensive for the locals to purchase, and leave to off world locations for a modest profit.  Those not interested in work can be found in the millions of space ports that dot the planet, or find a job doing reconstruction on the buildings and infrastructure of the city planet (constant repair and replacements of support walls keep the city from collapsing on itself). Huge numbers of employees require a proportionately huge number of clerks, accountants, and book keepers.  Nearly every kind of employment can be found on Huran IV; forestry specialist is an often over-looked niche job.
**Government** 
The planet is separated into a series of eight duchies (governed by a duke), separated along equator and two latitude lines.  These are further separated into Marches (governed by a marquis) roughly the size of a continent.  The next size smaller are the Territories (each run by a Earl), each holding at least three cities as their areas of influence.  Individual cities (areas many times the size of cities on other planets) are governed by Viscounts, who separate their fief into baronies for better control (the title baron includes those powers left to police commissioners, among other things).
Outside the traditional government are the Elite.  These super wealthy families (for Huran IV) live apart from normal society, and fall outside of the governments power.  Though the occurrences of the Elite interacting with the rest of Huran IV are rare, everyone is aware of the Elite's untouchable status.  The best known case the Trail of F'drick Ottoman.  F'drick, the heir to the Ottoman family, took to wandering the mid to lower levels, picking fights.  On one such violent travel, he killed no less than a dozen bystanders.  Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to show the Elites they were accountable for their actions- and perhaps to get a taste of the those rumored inexhaustible funds- the local Earl pressed for F'frick to answer for his crimes.  The Ottoman family ignored the Earl's demands until he sent troops to the Elite's private quarters (a mansion deck claiming four floors over a hundred acres in diameter).  Then, a mercenary fleet, including one battle ship, appeared within a few days, and parked themselves over the Earl's home.  No further attempts were made to apprehend F'Drick.
    Legal- Law enforcement on Huran IV is weak at best, with a myriad of opportunities to bribe one's way out of trouble with the constables.  Corruption is the rule as opposed to the exception, to the extent of laws being passed strictly to have more opportunities for bribes.  Permits, for example, can be legally purchased for nearly every weapon in the galaxy.  Cutting through all the 'red tape' however, will require a whisper in some one's ear, and the right palms greased.
The only time the constables for is both efficient and not bribed is when a crime is committed against the Elite.  If the true criminal cannot be found within a few days, one is created for it.  All investigations- both actual and false- are thoroughly done, and the records concerning such are turned over to the Elite family.  This is more to attempt to keep the Elites in their inaccessible homes, and out of society.
**Entertainment**
Sports- Sports make up a large portion of the Huran entertainment, but only a few are native- or even played- planet side.  With over-crowding a daily issue, giving up space for a Nuller Ball stadium, or finding a field flat enough for Baav racing is far from anyone's mind.  Off planet sports, however, attract huge followings.  The bantha racing of Jherit and the bloody open ice battles of Bandor are especially well received, counting at least a trillion avid watchers between them (some favorites of the Huran population have more fans on Huran IV than there are people on the planet the sport is played).  Emotions run deep when favorite teams play, and riots involving hundreds of thousands are not unheard of.  During an especially important game between two rivals, a local Earl banned the game from being played in her territory.  The resulting riot took six weeks to quell, an taught the other Earls an important lesson on pleasing the public.
Native Sports do exist, but few are every televised.  Swoop Canyons, a form of street racing involving swoops and the maze like Huran streets, constantly scramble traffic patterns.  *Kress*, a foot races style game played across city roof tops, is popular among the younger and more physically fit. The use of animals in games are rare, but one notable exception is Raptoring.  These big avians are caught, tamed, and ridden in all manner of events, ranging from simple races to "Purse Snatching on the Wing".
**Other Groups**
    The Elite- The Elite are only notionally members of Huran IV's society.  Wealthy beyond measure- at least when compared to normal citizens, the Elite are above the simple concerns that dominate the minds of the rest of the city planet.  The Elites' history is tied directly to the founding of the Huran system; in truth, the Elite are descended from the founders of the Huran system.  Their wealth started at the exploitation of the world's nature resources, slowly shifting to more mercantile and commercial pursuits as the population swelled.  Now, it is almost impossible to know how the Elites are funded, though most suspect off-world interest now fills the Elites' coffers.
    Trader's Guild- Properly known as the Honorable Market Guild of the Citizens of the Huran System, the trader's guild has it's fingers into ever legal purchase conducted within the system.  Their lawyers are experts in both local and galactic law, and their investigative teams excel beyond those most other systems.  Needless to say, if a sentient attempts to buy or sell anything in the Hrran system, the Trader's Guild has a piece of it.
**Notable Figures** 
    An'na Penn- An'na Penn is the most well known Elite to the general population due to her glamorous and public life style.  Clubs, festivals, theme parks, anywhere there is guaranteed a crowd and fun, An'na goes there.  Loved and envied by all, she takes great strides to break no law while she is out on the town.  She is a party hound, a drama queen, and the star of countless tabloids. She has appeared in numerous film, TV shows, and made a startling large number of public speeches.  There is even a 'reality show' made of a dozen cameras following her and her 25 bodyguards (every last one a beautiful and deadly woman) around the planet.  An'na is very open, and is more than willing to talk about anything not related to the Elites.  
    Paj- A terrorist attack on the barony closes down a tunnel, forcing a diplomat's repulser to deviate down another tunnel, where it gets caught in the cross fire of two rival gangs after the same prize.  The damaged repulsor makes a forced landing at a local repair shop, where a pickpocket lifts the data slate of the diplomat's pilot.  The pick pocket sells the data slate to some ship-jackers, who steal the vessel the same moment customs is headed to inspect a known smuggler. The smuggler watches in amusement as the port officials chase after the diplomat's craft while his crew unloads the contraband.  He needs space in his cargo hold quickly; the goods he came to pick up had two rival gangs fighting over it a few hours before.  
The mysterious figure of the underworld, this creature's name is only whispered.  No one seems to ever have met Paj, but everyone knows someone who worked for hi/her/it.  Whatever else Paj is, the unknown figure is brilliant to say the least (if it is only one figure).  Layers upon layers of interconnecting plots, networks of criminal and legitimate business activities, and endless patience, the plans of this hidden figure are beyond the scope any who sought to discover a motive.  The security forces recognize his works when seemingly unconnected events occur in just the prefect order.
    Baron Caser Guther-  Baron Guther is a baron trying to make a difference.  He has increased the funds to the constables in his sector, passed several reforms improving the standard of living in his barony, and done his best to squash the corruption in his office.  His efforts have improved the life of his subject, ruined his marriage, and cost the underworld figures several small fortunes.  His family fortune is dwindling, and soon he will not be able to afford the bodyguards that have kept him alive thus far.  It is not expected that he'll survive the next few years.
**Historic Moments**
     The Culling Riots- The speculated growth rate of 36 billion a year (over a thousand babies born per second)- without much room, to grow, is cause enough for any leader to panic.  Various methods were attempted, from cash benefits to those citizens taking up residence in other planets, to incredible taxes on those having more than one child.  Few showed any positive results, whether it be to the lack of organization, too little funds, or simply because the idea was poorly thought out.
Drastic measures were called for.  
Culling the population sounded viable until word of this proposal reached the ears of one district near the capital, Jussianberg.  One hundred million citizens rioted, causing a truly terrible death toll, and causing incalculable property damage.  Several thousand government officials were dragged into the streets and killed.  The riots were only quelled when the famous negotiator, Ramman d'Ool (a twi'lik native to Huran IV, and well known for the power of his voice), assured the population that culling, in any form would be practiced on the population of Huran IV.
No other volatile idea was very brought to the table.

So...this took a while.  Anyhow, this is my first almost-but-not-quite fully fleshed out planet for consideration into the Kalium Galaxy.  It's not Corusaunt, but it's darker twin.  
The population is based off of New York City.  Considering how many levels this place has, there still must be whole sections that are unpopulated.  But, there you go.
I wanted a place that literally anyone can get lost in.  With 6,000,000,000,000 people walking around, there should be easily enough for some one to disappear.  I did the math, and given a 0.3% growth rate (the USA currently has a 1% growth rate) you get a population growth rate of around 18 billion a year (that's 18 billion more people living than dying in a year).  This is absolutely nuts.
Anyhow...so what do yawl think?

Wow. I don't think I've ever put this much detail into one planet. It's interesting, but it's missing something . . .
It needs a stronger hook on the society, I think. I liked the flora and fauna, but you lost me during the part on the society. It didn't feel special to me.
Sorry if I'm not much help.

I like it, even the Paris Hilton deal <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->
A seedy planet, mob rule <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) --> a nice place to bury your yard "trimmings" (thats from the Simpson movie). I could see this planet used in any starwars game even lucus verse.

It's suppose to be just another planet in the galaxy, not the core of it.  Special isn't necessarily required.  Maybe.
But, I do strive to please.  So, what else can I add to the society to make it more intriguing?  I want something that some one can read and think "hey!  I suddenly have a game idea based on that one sentence!"  Any ideas?

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-14 20:35:45)

Being special *is* required. Without that, I would have no reason to send my players there. I could just pick a different planet. Of course, I've never sent my players to most of the worlds in the Lucas Galaxy just because I couldn't find anything I was intrigued by.
That being said, Huran IV is unique, I just didn't get the society. I really liked the flora and fauna (as I mentioned before). Maybe they could hold a bigger place in society? The way the Glow Spiders are importantto the lower levels. Hunting could be a common sport, as the Elite hunt the smog lizards in their native habitat. Maybe giant birds live in the abandoned buildings and occasionally snatch away someone important (or the Elite train them to dispose of their rivals).
Do you see what I'm saying? (Or am I really that bad at this?)

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-14 22:15:33)

Completely ignore my last post. I finally figured out what it was that was bothering me about the society. My last post was more about me trying to figure out what it was than actually helping you.
You have the Elites, the poor, and the corrupt cops, but they just don't sit around all day with mundane lives. You have billions of people of every imaginable species living side-by-side. Is civil unrest an every day occurance? Do most of the people work in factories, turning out children's toys or weapons (or maybe both)? Do the Elites have jobs (legal or otherwise), or do they just sit around and look pretty?
My point is, what is it that they *do* there? On Tatooine, for example, you had moisture farmers trying to make an honest living in the desert, while all manners of scum and villiany lived and hid in the cities. You have a violent civilization living off the land and targeting the farmers, and a society of merchants roaming the sands. The Hutts ruled from their far off palaces.
You knew what the point of everything was, and that's Tatooine is one of my favorite Star Wars planets. The people were doing something, not just living there, which is more the impression I got from Huran IV's society.

Ah. That makes sense. Expand on the poluation more, what they do, what kind of work they do, how they play, etc. If I threw in a comment about geese juggling and how it was a popular past time, then the society would have more depth. Gotcha. I'll work on it.
The Elites...they were intentionally left a little vague, but I can elaborate. Many have their fingers in almost everything on planet (something about their ancestors being the founders of the planet, and therefore have rights to everything on the planet), but have massive interests off planet. They are almost completely apart from the mundane lives that live and die at their feet. Elites were suppose to be able to influence galactic events, if they so choose. Wild cards for the GM's use, should they need one. Who and what each one does is plot driven.
Society as a whole: So, I should add some entertainment and work for the population to do, right? At the top, I listed consumer goods as the chief export, with raw material being the major import. This was intended to show they produced massive amounts of goods, but nothing in particular or special. But I think your right; I need more detail there.
A few lines describing the carefully constructed time tables and light control (for the lower levels) could create a 100% constant work load would do wonders. Kind of three people working at one desk in rotating shifts, so the desk is never empty kind of thing. And it doesn't have to be all that efficient either. A machine breaks in a factory, and 12 people can't work until it's fixed. However, due to so ancient law dealing with availible work force, they can't find any other work until it's fixed. Pity that the company won't pay to fix it for another couple of weeks.

Nice One! This is awesome. I can't wait to see the official post on the main site!

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-23 16:11:21)

Thanks Rowan. When I get the time to finish it, and others like it, I'll see about posting it.

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-24 21:38:19)

Added Huran Raptors, an entertainment section (still needs non-sport entertainment) and some employment stuff.
Tell me what yawl think

### **Anonymous** (2008-09-27 18:19:37)

I haven't had much time, but I've given it a quick lookover, and the new sections help it a lot. The world makes sense now.
Is there anything about tourism in there, or any reasons offworlders come to Huran IV?

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2008-09-28 21:17:35)

It's not a tourist hotspot, I can tell you that.  I figure visitors show up for the same reason people go to big cities that aren't vacation spots: family is there, work is there, there is always something to do there, etc.  It's a huge place, with literally everything in another place is located there (except, ya know, elbow room).  Plus, with a growth rate of 570 a second, visitors who decide to stay are a heavy burden.
Hey, here is a thought...taxes.  If the average Huran makes 25 grand a year, and the planet has a 5% income tax (not including Elites, who aren't likely to pay taxes) the Huran Government will make...7,500,000,000,000,000 credits yearly.  That's uh...7.5 quadrillion credits (I had to look that number name up).  With that much money floating around, you gotta figure a few living large is easy.

Cleaned up some stuff that was roughed up during the transfer.  I think it's ready to be posted as "officially" Kalium galaxy material.
So...how does one do that?  Could I just say "Would the the Mighty and All Power Rowan touched this entry with his Divine Might and transfer it to where it Needs to Go"?

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-13 03:20:06)

You probably could, though he'd also probably prefer you did it.  Assuming you have Author status (he still needs that right?), you need to follow theses steps.  Click on the Kalium Galaxy link at the top of the site's home page (not the forum home page), and then on the appropriate category (in this case Planets, then Core Worlds).  On the left side of your page you should have a "blank page" icon.  Fill in all the information (I copy and paste to save time), make sure its formatted to the Saga Edition standard, hit the save button, then wait for Rowen to approve it.  Simple as that.
If you have more questions, just ask.  I've already submitted seven articles so I think I've got a handle on it.  I'm also the only one who's submitted anything, so I think it's about time someone else has (others have before, but they were lost during site transitions; I'm just the only one who's resubmitted).
