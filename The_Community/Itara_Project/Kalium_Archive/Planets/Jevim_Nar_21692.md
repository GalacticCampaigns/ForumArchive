An aquatic planet, Jevim Nar is almost constantly lashed by dangerous rainstorms. It didn't always used to be this way, but long centuries of industrial damage(combined with the impact of one of the Hyperspace Rings during the Great War) ushered in a new, darker age. Survivors retreated into cities built on the seas, equal part above and below the water's surface. For the first time, they encountered the planet's natives, an aquatic race calling themselves the Narrans, leading the settlers and natives to compromise on a new name for their planet combining the names both had previously used: â€œJevimâ€ and â€œNarâ€.
Jevim Nar attracts little in the way of attention from outsiders, except for tourists interested in the underwater wonders to be found there (from the aquatic civilization of the Narrans, to the ruins of the old Jevim civilization, to the natural formations found only in the deeps of Jevim Nar, to the giant crater left by the crashed Hyperspace Ring). This, and the world's thriving fishing industry (many delicacies have their origin in Jevim Nar's seas). The planet's government has made removal of the fish to breed and farm elsewhere illegal.
Itâ€™s capital city, Hacksi, is home to the combined governments of the Jevim and the Narrans. It is built both above and below the oceanâ€™s surface, near the equator. Since the Jevim cannot survive underwater, the lower portions of the city are sealed tight against the water, but still feel damp. The architecture of the two civilizations clash repeatedly throughout the city, giving it an almost unplanned feel to it.

DC / Result
10 / There exists an almost symbiotic relationship between the colonists and the Jevim. They both need each other to survive and this has created a lasting peace between them.
15 / While the Jevim are very technology-oriented, the Narrans prefer to live at peace with their environment whenever possible. The two have found a way to bring the two into harmony, but only after centuries of trying.

DC / Result
10 / The planet was once home to the great, industrial colonies of the Jevim. However, the Jevim did not do much to protect the environment and it nearly destroyed their world.
15 / The crater left by the crashed Hyperspace Ring is still a dangerous place, as it still continues to leak radiation into the surrounding area after all this time.
**<span style="font-size: 0.04em;">Knowledge (Life Sciences)</span>**
DC / Result
10 / The Jevim are a race of near-humans. They have only slight differences with baseline humans: slightly larger lungs, grey-tinted skin, and universal blue eyes.
15 / The oceans of Jevim Nar are filled with all sorts of creatures, many of which have been domesticated by the Narrans: the Narran shark, the great eel, and the Narran dancing fish among them

good job, but light gravity is anything under .8 of normal, so 90% is normal gravity

Right. Thanks.
