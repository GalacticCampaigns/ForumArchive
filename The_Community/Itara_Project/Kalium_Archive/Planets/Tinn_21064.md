**<span style="font-size: 2.00em;">Tinn</span>**
**Region:** Mid Rim
**Climate:** Temperate
**Gravity:** Normal
**Moons:** Uncountable (most are actually asteroid remnants of the planet)
**Length of Day:** 98 standard hours
**Length of Year:** 97.5 local days
**Sapient Species:** 99.9% Togruta, .1% other
**Government:** The High Councils of the Togruta tribes
**Capital:** City of the Black Moon
**Major Exports:** Shatter Crystal
**Major Imports:** Everything else
Tinn was once a beautiful wilderness world of sprawling forests, majestic peaks, and shallow oceans. However, it ended up in the middle of the first galactic war, and that's when things got bad. Its location along two major trade routes and its naturally occurring Shatter Crystals put it at the center of several major battles. It was the Fifth Battle of Tinn that would decide the future of the world, and one that is remembered even to this day. The battle involved over three hundred vessels and countless troops on the ground.
One side--no one quite remembers who--was losing badly. In a last ditch effort to save their forces on the ground, they opened fire on the planet's surface. The turbo lasers affected the Shatter Crystal in the planet's crust in an unexpected way--half the planet exploded outwards.
From that day on, Tinn has been nothing but half a planet, floating in its own asteroid field. Somehow, the ecosystem managed to survive, and there is a thriving civilization on what is left of the world. It's tide-locked to its sun, so that the surviving portion of the world is always in daylight. The asteroids surrounding the planet help keep it habitable by causing almost daily eclipses.
The dark side of the world -- the "broken" side -- is a place of jagged mountains, some stretching a hundred miles into the thin air. Though the Togruta do not live here, mynocks and Nightside Rancors are among the creatures that do. Legends and myths surrounding this area have built up over the years, and many grow more fantastic and terrible with each retelling.
Its capital, the City of the Black Moon, sits on the edge of the world, near the destroyed section. The sky above it is often dominated by a large, black asteroid, hence its name. The city also has the planet's only *official* spaceport, and most of the trade going off world is conducted there. It is also the only city featuring modern buildings. The rest of the world lives in stone and wood huts, gathered into villages.
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Knowledge (Social Sciences)</span>**
DC / Result
10 / The Togruta on Tinn are known to be very aggressive, even more so than their counterparts across the galaxy.
15 / The Togruta have never been affiliated with any major government, preferring to keep to themselves. Unfortunately for them, the galaxy often has other plans.
20 / The Togruta tribes are very territorial, and will fiercely defend their lands from any encroachment, by forwarders or other tribes.
25 / A delicate peace exists among the tribes. The social patterns that govern the relationship between them is almost impossible for anyone not born into them to figure out.
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Knowledge (Galactic Lore)</span>**
DC / Result
10 / Tinn was once a center of commerce, thanks to its location along two major trade routes. However, since the near-destruction of the planet, it has become a backwater world.
15 / The planet came into its current state in an event known as the Cataclysm, which involved turbolasers laying waste to a continent and exploding the Shatter Crystal in the continent's crust. The resulting explosion blew apart the planet.
**<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Knowledge (Life Sciences)</span>**
DC / Result
10 / The oceans are strangely still. Many of the creatures that once lived there were devastated by the Cataclysm, many never recovered. Only the smallest of them survived.
15 / The planet is home to the massive and aptly-named Nightside Rancor, a beast that even frightens the natives.
20 / Though the planet is half-gone, it somehow managed to survive and still supports life. Scientists cannot agree to a consensus as to why, but most agree it has to do with the Shatter Crystals.

very nice <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
looks like prime material for the Great War :

Indeed this is another fine addition. Great work!

Nice going. Actually, this place reminds me of Peragus from KOTORII. The asteroids in the orbiting field wouldnÂ´t happen to be highly volatile would they?

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-12 13:10:26)

Possibly, as there might be some Shatter Crystal left in them, though it likely all detonated when the planet was blown out.
It's funny, though. I've never played KotOR II.

I just looked Peragus on Wookieepedia.
> Its life proved to be short, however, when an accidental blaster shot triggered an explosion of flammable substances in Peragus II&#39;s crust and mantle, so powerful that it turned a large chunk of the planet into an asteroid field and exposed its core.

Here's my version:
> The turbo lasers affected the Shatter Crystal in the planetâ€™s crust in an unexpected way â€” half the planet exploded outwards. From that day on, Tinn has been nothing but half a planet, floating in its own asteroid field.

That's too eerily similar. Wow. The biggest difference here is that I still have people living on my world.

Ok first thing that comes to mind here is dark side of the moon. What resides on the other side of the planet the former mid rim /core. Dark creatures could reside within twisted networks of caverns. Like MoDa Vader said its possible some remnants of the crystals survived now guarded fiercely by these monstrosities. I need to read the shattered crystals now ïŠ

You know, I never thought about the "broken" side of the planet before. It would be the perfect home of the ruin-rancor, a monstrous creature I'm working on.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-11-12 13:56:47)

Sounds good, but..."ruin-rancor"? <!-- s:? -->![:?](https://i.ibb.co/KcdH3QwT/icon-e-confused.gif)<!-- s:? -->

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-12 14:01:17)

Yeah, it's sort of a place-holder name. I'm working on it.

Another thing that comes to mind is the planets rotation. If the surviving surface of the planet did not rotate and always faced the systems sun this could explain its prosperity. The moons and asteroids themselves would provide enough shelter from the constant radiation from the sun and provide some shade.
This in turn would give the dark side the opposite effect. Mynocks could be the common foraging creature though darker horrors would reside deep within. The air itself would be thin at best. The surface of the dark side jagged mountain pecks in places dropping hundreds of miles. The surface locals would fear and revere this place. It could be used as ritual proving grounds but generally avoided. Just a few more thoughts.

Whoa, I love it, Tru. Keep those ideas coming (and I mean for the whole galaxy, not just my planet).
I think I'll add some of that to the planet description.
