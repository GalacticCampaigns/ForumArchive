**Driona**
**Region**: Mid Rim
**climate**: tropical, temperate in mountains (all low oxygen)
**Gravity**: Standard
**Moons**: 1
**Length of Day**: 24 standard hours
**Length of Year**: 400 standard days
**Sapient Species**: 98% Kel Dor (native), 2% other
**Government**: Republic
**Capital**: Shanâ€™dor
**Major Exports**: exotic animals
**Major Imports**: Technology
**Knowledge (Galactic Lore)**
**DC** **Result**
15 Driona has a unique atmosphere toxic to oxygen-breathing species, but is perfect for the Kel Dor species.
20 Driona has long been a member of galactic society
25 Driona has recently become a new learning center for the Bendu monks, specifically for the many Kel Dor who join the Bendu.
30 The Bendu monastery on Driona is high on the remote mountain Ionia within Drionaâ€™s large rainforest.
**Knowledge (life sciences)**
**DC** **Result**
15 Drionaâ€™s atmosphere is mostly helium and native gases, with little oxygen. Kel Dor therefore need special breath masks to go onto other worlds without suffocating, and travelers coming to Driona as well need breath masks.
20 Drionaâ€™s tropical forests have given birth to a unique group of species, though these creatures need special environment cages or exhibits to be held on planets other than Driona.
25 For reasons unknown all Kel Dor can hear the force, though few learn to use it.
Driona is a planet of tropical forests, and mountains, with cities built on the border between the two environments. The Kel Dor are friendly to any who visit the planet (which is not often due to the atmosphere). The planet has recently become a major learning/training center for the Bendu, specifically the Kel Dor Bendu, as a large majority of Bendu are Kel Dor. Many non-Kel Dor (especially rodians), come here to train within the jungles and mountains as a survival test. The cities of Kel Dor are clean, built with architecture resembling some of the exotic beasts and creatures found only on Driona.

Nice! Cant wait to see those.
We have had a influx of members since the site has reorganized itself. I counted at least 12 active new members. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come.

Nice! It's cool. I'll add it to the map, and repost the thing after I add in my Togruta homeworld, Tinn.
