# The Core Planets

### **Rowen** (2008-05-21 23:27:16)

Older members will know that the galactic core had already been created by having members create names and voting on there favorite ones. So essentially this section was already finished. I am posting everything here as it was originally on the first site I created.

**Core World Descriptions**
**Hyperis:** The Jewel of the Kalium Galaxy
A city scape planet, dotted with deep lakes. From orbit the city lights give the appearance of a jewel on the backdrop of space while the calm clear lakes give it a mirror like finish. A bustling trade port Hyperis boasts a large population as well as being a major shipping route. With it orbital weather control stations the planet enjoys warm days and cool nights, Hyperis sports the latest luxuries with respects to technology. Said to be one of the centers of the galaxy Hyperis`s people are extremely diverse with humans, near-humans and aliens alike from across the cosmos calling Hyperis home.
Hyperis is a developer and manufacturer of technological wonders in most fields of science including but not limited to hyper drive, droids, star ship construction, and more. Though Hyperis maintains a sizable defense force, it has yet to use it save chasing off the odd pirate. Hyperis has remained neutral in all recorded conflicts, this neutrality has lead it to its success always having trade options unattainable to other systems.
**Jherit:**
Jherit is inhabited by mostly poor locals who are farmers, yet there is a growing industrial sector in the larger spaceport cities of the planet. The majority of the population is human, although there are a high percentage of alien races now, and there are rumors of an indigenous race that thrive and live in the desert wastelands. But not much is yet know of this race.
The planet has been the site of repeated attempts at colonization, but most recently due to advancing technology it seems that the colonization is taking hold. Because of this now Jherit has several sizable cities, the largest of which is the free spaceport city of Doata, know for its insidious criminal underworld.
Notable geological features include the Great Sea of Sand, an enormous desert which covers a large area of land, and the vast mountain range of Moradin Ka, which borders the desert. Jherit has three moons visible in the night sky, Asori which is the largest of the three, Luha slightly smaller, and Ryra which shines with a reddish glow.
**Bandor**
Bandor is a frigid planet; a wasteland of ice, snow, and blisteringly cold winds. It is only hospitable thanks to the stubborn colonization efforts of early Zabrak settlers (who arrived the hard way, before the advent of hyperspace travel, and had to do the best they could with the planet they had found). Its cities are all underground where they are less affected by the extreme environment, and their heat is carefully regulated by powerful computer systems. A whole industry has developed around the maintenance of these computers, since their failure would be a disaster.
Bandor also has a native race, once primitive but changed through long contact with galactic citizens since the original settlers. The Bandorans are squat, hairy mammals with white fur, vaguely bearlike in appearance ((think somewhere between a Wookie and an Ewok, then cross it with a polar bear)).
Were it not a Core World, Bandor would probably not have developed since its humble beginnings. As it is, however, industry and developers could only ignore Bandor in favor of more hospitable Core planets for so long; where other Core planets were becoming crowded, Bandor was still largely undeveloped.
These days, Bandor is primarily an industrial planet, and its citizens are largely there because their job requires it. The exception are wealthy aristocrat and merchant families, who have taken to building holiday homes on the planet's surface, elaborate ice palaces that cost several small fortunes. The individual who first patented the concept, Genath Ols, went on to invest in exotic housing projects throughout the Core and Ols Industries eventually branched into other fields such as starship design. Today, Ols Industries is still a known name throughout the Galaxy.
**Firaxia**
A planet with rolling farmland and forest. Know for it Star ship building as well as it sea side Hamlets and villages. The people of Firaxia have been sailors and fisherman for most of the planets history. So it was only natural that they became great pilots and navigators to the stars.
The planet has 4 major land masses and 3 major city Firaxia City the capital and planetary government seat. Solar major seaside resort and shipping docks. Firaxia has orbiting shipyards and docks, Factory's and defence stations.
Planetary government is ruled by House Jordan. The house controls all shipping and defense of planetary interest on and off planet.
Honor and pride mean everything to the people of this planet. The Cruisers and transport ships produced on Firaxia are highly sought after by others in the Galaxy.
Firaxia City is a large metropolitan area that covers a large part of one of the major continents and can be seen form orbit.
This is the home of main planetary security forces. Large amount of smuggling and smugglers centered here this been outlawed by the house but the pride and independent nature of the people make it hard to get rid of.
Climate is mild and temperate,with plenty of rain and a longer growing seasons great for farming. Winters are short but cold and hard especially in the mountains.
**Jevim Nar**
An aquatic planet, Jevim Nar is almost constantly lashed by dangerous rainstorms. It didn't always used to be this way, but long centuries of industrial damage to the planet and it's atmosphere ushered in a new, darker age. Survivors retreated into cities built on the seas, equal part above and below the water's surface. For the first time, they encountered the planet's natives, an aquatic race calling themselves the Narrans ((similar in appearance to Zoras from the Zelda games)), leading the settlers and natives to compromise on a new name for their planet combining the names both had previously used: "Jevim" and "Nar".
Jevim Nar attracts little in the way of attention from outsiders, except for tourists interested in the underwater wonders to be found there (from the aquatic civilization of the Narrans, to the ruins of the old Jevim civilization, to the natural formations found only in the deeps of Jevim Nar. This, and the world's thriving fishing industry (many delicacies have their origin in Jevim Nar's seas, and the planet's government has made removal of the fish to breed and farm elsewhere illegal.
**Kalous**
A tiny planet covered primarily with jungle, but it also features a substantial cityscape the city of Telan. The planet is known for its well-stocked star port an orbiting space station, a well stocked trade port its also well armed. Kalous also supports a very large star ship junkyard, many companies within Kalous buy used star ships and star ship parts for resale as refurbished ships.
The planets surface sees much heavy cloud cover, the planet sports much rain fall fog in the mornings with high humidity year round. The many small seas of Kalous are the only breaks within the planets jungle surface as a multitude of small seas criss cross the globe. Kalous`s vast jungle vegetation has grown to giant proportions with most of its plant life dwarfing humanoids and vehicles alike, it would be easy to get lost within the jungle of Kalous. Carnivorous plants, which are sometimes sold off world to zoos and wealthy buyers are a constant danger if one was to brave the jungle floor. The jungle itself threatens to overgrow the entire planet, this is a continuous undertaken of Kalous`s population as they work daily to keep the city from drowning in a sea of jungle overgrowth. This is evident in the ancient ruins that turn up on the jungle floor from time to time, though to be the remnants of a lost civilization.
Kalous supports a small but very organized military base, which serves as the defence force of its peoples. It is warned before going to Kalous double check your ships security codes, some of the galaxies best ship jackers hail from Kalous coming to such profession only after falling to bad fortune.
**Kenyor Prime**
A medium sized planet covered primarily with deserts atop vast plateaus, but it also features deep great winding ravines to which its cities are built vertically. Originally a mining colony Kenyor Prime has grown to become an important producer of dura steal and in the last one hundred years one of the best star ship manufacturers in the galaxy. Kenyor Works is the single largest company within the planet, its ship designs are in use across the galaxy.
Kenyor double suns create a harsh surface environment atop the desert plateaus, though the citizens enjoy cooler climate within the deep ravines that support their vertical cities. The Kenyor system is mineral rich, Kenyor Prime itself has six moons. Of the ten planets in the system, only two are gas giants while the other eight planets have development of some level on them including their moons. This level of population make the Kenyor system very industrious.
Though a key planet within the core systems Kenyor would see little traffic save its ship yards and podracing, which run straight through the cities themselves. This attracts both visitors and business alike from across Kalium.
**Oâ€™an**
O'an's tourist board insists their planet is the vacation capital of the galaxy and has the statistics to prove it. The planet's the landmass consists of a great number of islands, and each is a masterpieces of natural and man-made beauty. Even those in the industrial sectors (primarily gathered around the polar extremes) cannot be considered ugly, with the design of buildings intended to blend in with their surroundings where possible and be aesthetically pleasing where not. On O'an you can choose an island as your perfect vacationdestination based on its geography and the activities offered there; the tourist board is careful to assign each island a set of appropriate activities and each offers a unique combination, so that each guest will be able to find a destination ideal for their needs and sensibilities.
O'an's capital is known as Emarand, and is situated in the middle of the planet's largest island, which is just north of the equator, and is only a short aircab ride from the amazing natural formations known as the Toppling Rocks.
It should come as no surprise that tourism is by far and away the biggest industry on O'an, accounting for as much as 70% of its total revenue.
**Tsloi**
The three-sunned world of Tsloi is a rocky one, barren of crops save for where the land has been painstakingly cultivated. Its settlements, with the exception of the capital of Tanaa, are universally small and tend to consist of little more than a few farms and moisture farms. If they're lucky, they have a cantina. The mining settlements are slightly bigger, but tend to be short-lived, as old mines are tapped and new mines are discovered, Tsloi's miners move on, driven by the needs of their industry rather than the desire to settle.
Tsloi has a high amount of deposits, and exports much in the way of precious metals and gems ((if Jedi exist in the Kalium Galaxy, Tsloi may be a major provider of focusing crystals). It is the money made from these exports that allow the mining giants who run the planet, Eng Corporation and Yimna Mining Concern, to build up Tanaa. Providing for the capital city is the driving force behind the planet's farming and moisture farming industries, as well as the reason behind most of the planet's import costs.
**New Moncada**
No world information available at this time.

Instead of me reposting these planets myself would the respective authors flesh them out for posting officially.
This way the original Authors get credit. Thanks in advance everyone. Also in light of Simply's absence I think it would be okay for someone to flesh out his planets if they so desire.

Are the owners for these planets going to work out the write up? Let me know since I've heard nothing. The top of the posts list those that originally came up with the planets.
please let me know.

I don't think since I joined I've ever seen Kress and Raptor

Yes unfortunately those two as well as simply have stopped frequenting the boards. Anyone that would like to flesh out what they started is free to do so, just let me know.

I'll give it some thought. The authors though have made it pretty easy for anyone who wants to stat them, as all the fluff easily translates into stats.

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 20:38:44)

Those planets were a result of our very first attempt at the Kalium Galaxy. We held a planet naming contest and those were the top picks for names. It was a lot of fun but a LOT more disorganized than this attempt. I wish I had know about Joomla back then, we would have had a TON of content already.

---

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-11 20:41:08)

those are pretty good names I gotta admit. I hope we can make a lot of progress now that we do have Joomla.
Hey, do you wanna chat in the chat room?

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 20:44:25)

Sure, I've got a few. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

### **master_Tru** (2008-11-11 20:52:48)

I could do more of a right up on the worlds I submitted. Only thing is I am a little busy at the moment so I would not expect anything soon.

### **Rowen** (2008-11-11 20:58:06)

When ever you can get them Tru, I'm in no rush. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

I'd be happy to try my hand at any planets that are available.

which pretty much is any planet not made by master tru

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-14 01:56:10)

hmm, at the moment Jherit and Bandor interest me, so if it's alright, I'd like to stat them (and the species associated with them)

### **Anonymous** (2008-11-14 13:28:38)

I think I'll take a stab at Jevim Nar.

### **simplyscribed** (2009-06-26 06:52:55)

I don't really have time to get too involved with the Kalium Galaxy, but if you would still like my assistance or advice in developing my planets just let me know.
