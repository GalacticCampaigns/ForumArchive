90% water, the surface of the world is almost perpetually shrouded in mist.  Great cities of Dura steel and glass are built within he fog, though few can ever see them.  Of course, the majority of the cities are built beneath the surface of their oceans, where the Nautolans are more at home.  Movement through these areas is highly restricted â€” not because of any laws, but because they simply donâ€™t provide any way for people to get to them, and thatâ€™s exactly how they like it.
While most of the cities have section above the water, only one city is built entirely beneath the waves â€” its capital, Tiana Madae.  A sprawling city of arching steel, Tiana Madae is truly a sight to behold for any lucky enough to see it.  Its architecture is graceful, and brings to mind the very waters it was built under.
The rest of the world, its landmasses, are covered in endless bogs, swamps, and moors.  There is very little in the way of natural forests, though the mist provides plenty of cover to the giant animals that roam it.  A few settlements have sprung up here and there, all founded by less-amphibious races.  None of them are very large, and the Nautolans are content to leave them be, as long as they donâ€™t interfere with the world too much.

DC / Result
10 / Sender is ruled by a Most Highly-Esteemed Monarch, currently Queen Levida, who is a temperamental leader, at best, and rage-prone, at worst.  She is brash and prone to rash action â€” a fact her political enemies exploit to no end.
15 / Though ruled by a monarch, the Senate Council makes the laws, though Queen Levida has the right to veto anything.

DC / Result
10 / Sender is a very wet world.  A light mist covers over 80% of the planetâ€™s landmasses during every season but summer, when some of the mist burns off.
15 / Various large, but harmless, creatures live in Senderâ€™s bogs.  While the natives tend to ignore them, they have become quite the tourist attraction for off-worlders, and many of the species are regularly preyed upon by big-game hunters.
25 / The Nautolanâ€™s past is a violence-filled epic.  While they have since pacified themselves (mostly), they refuse to talk about it and anyone inquiring into it will receive only icy stares in response.

DC / Result
10 / Nautolan physiology is very dependent on adrenaline.  While it is similar in many ways to the adrenaline of other species, the adrenaline of the other species cannot be substituted for their own.
15 / Nautolan pheromones are mildly poisonous to most other species â€” except, curiously, the Wookiees, who are known to be immune to it.
20 / Nautolans are the only known species on their planet to secrete the pheromones.  None of the other creatures excrete anything similar.

It was the first species that popped into my head when I was writing it.  Yeah, that much thought went into it.
