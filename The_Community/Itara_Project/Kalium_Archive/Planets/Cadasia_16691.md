**Cadasia**
**Region**: Between the equilivent of the outer rim and unknown space
**Climate**: Temperate
**Gravity**: Standard
**Moons**: 1
**Length of Day**: 20 hours
**Length of Year**: 370 days
**Sapient Species**: 99.99% Cadan (native), .01% other
**Government**: Military Dictatorship
**Capital**: Dagon
**major exports**: Technology, weapons (though not to most of the civilizations in the Kalium galaxy)
**Major Imports**: Food, raw materials (though not from most of the civilizations in the Kalium galaxy)
**Knowledge (Galactic Lore)
DC Result**
20 Cadasia is a little known planet, it's inhabitants are inhosipitable to outsiders. It has little contact with most of the galaxy, though with exceptions for a few civilizations
25 Though Cadasia has had little contact with the rest of the galaxy, they are actually more advanced than the majority of civiliations
30 The Cadans have been involved in wars in their little known part of space with even littler known species, which is why their weapons and armor have become so advanced.
**Knowledge (social sciences)
DC Result**
20 The only people allowed to stay in Cadan Space are those with high intelligence, as this is the only thing Cadans respect.
**Knowledge (bureaucracy)
DC Result**
15 Cadans, no matter what profession they go into are taught about technology, like how to make it, repair it, how it works, etc.
Cadasia is mainly an urban planet, the only natural places are mountain ranges, though laboratories are sometimes built in the higher, more isolated mountains. Cadasia has little pollution, as they solved it with they technology, but they do have a strong industrial manufacturing base. As the homeworld of the Cadans, very few non-Cadans get to visit this planet, and even fewer non-Cadans live here.
Cadasia has over a dozen major cities, it's capital being Dagon. These cities are made with quadanium steel, and are mainly gray and black in color. For the most part there are few pedestrians, (mainly slaves), the Cadans for the most part fly in airspeeders above the pedestrians. Landing platforms are set near or on top of the buildings, from offices, schools, and factories. Cadan police patrol armed both on foot and in military airspeeders. The most important cities have partial shield grids, mainly covering the government buildings, Cadan populace sectors, and military bases. The factories and slave living spaces are left to fend for themselves for the most part. In the main government headquarters, a secret underground section was set aside for the Cadan Initiative, and was the site of the creation of the Reaping.

That's a good start, but (you knew there was a but coming, didn't you?) what about terrain? Info like that is crucial for an original planet. Is it forested, urban, aquatic? Real planets are varied, Star Wars planets are not (most of the time). What is Cadasia like?

Would a species who deals mostly with technology, and primarily concerned with the advancement technology really care about the environment? Methinks they would only care if they discovered a terrible atmosphere, soil, and oceans would interfere with their industrial progress. Even then, I think it would be interesting to mention something about the fresh and clean enviorment showing the planet still in the process of healing the scars it's population did generations before.
For the population, I am all cool with it as it is, but thought I should mention a possiblity: if a visitor showed up on planet, and saw that the Cadan's not only surpressed every other culture, but had a vast number of subservient species on their planet, they might think they are on the edge of rebellion. Some one wise might think "the Cadan are super intelligent, and they must know these people will not, or cannot, rebel on this planet. The slaves and servants here will not, and cannot, spy, or steal, to otherwise make life difficult for their Cadan masters. As a matter of fact, the cadan had us see these unchained, yet still slave people, to show us how unafraid of revolt they are."
These is power to be able to swim among the sharks, and know you will not get bit.

well, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't want their planet to die, or change climates drastically, if they've been around since kotor time, just for reference, there planet would be riddled with pollution, and so maybe they've taken the steps in 4000 years to reverse it
Hmm, having the Cadans slaves on Cadasia would be interesting indeed, but for the most part I think the slaves are more common on the other colonies the Cadans possess

Diffidently off to a good start here. More description of the land, building architecture will sell this idea I believe. I look forward to seeing more. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->
