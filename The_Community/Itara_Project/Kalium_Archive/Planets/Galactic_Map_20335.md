Here's a link for the entire map on one screen.

I didn't know if there already was a map of the galaxy, but I was working on one for another game and I decided to go ahead and do one.Â  So what do you guys think?
(If anyone would like their planet moved, go ahead and PM me and I'll see what I can do.)

Very nice looking map! But I have one question, wouldn't the core planets be a little closer to the core of the actual galaxy. They seem a bit spread out to the midrims a little.
Other than that I think it look WAY better than the old one I made.

You know, I think you're right. Kenyor, New Moncada, and O'an are definitely too far out. It's easy enough to fix, so I'll see what I can do.

Indeed, it looks great. Can I reserve a small dark patch for the government I'm developing? <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

Show me the government, and we'll find a place to put it. There's plenty of galaxy to go around, so the more planets and sectors the better.
Oh, and I moved the Core Worlds in a bit, Rowen. How does it look now?

Looks much better. <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Thanks for the compliments, y'all.

Okay, updated map with new planet info. If anyone else has any planets coming, feel free to tell me about 'em and I'll add them to the map.

Updated map again, with SacredPhoenix's two new planets.

Updated again, this time with two more worlds.  Does anyone know how to make the image smaller?
