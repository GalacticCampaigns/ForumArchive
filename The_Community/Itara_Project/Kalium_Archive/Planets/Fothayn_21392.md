Fothayn is a well-known world in the Mid-rim. It is best known for the Neogrounds Industrial, which is the largest creator of starships in the galaxy. Most of the planet is covered by factories and the capital Idoa is really the only city on the planet. While not an overly popular tourist destination, expensive hotels and other shops have been created, as businessmen and officials from large companies, militaries, and governments, often arrive here. Calistt, Fothaynâ€™s moon has extensive hangars built into its natural craters, and has enough space to hold over 5000 ships. Access to Calistt is very restricted and generally only members of Neogrounds Industrial can get permits to visit the moon, as it is the location of many secret projects. Fothayn has become one of the worlds that many governments depend on for their starships, and so has been a target of invasions to take control of Fothaynâ€™s ship building resources, though all of these invasions have failed for a variety of reasons, including its powerful defense systems, which alone can deter any pirate fleet, let alone the considerable fleet that defends Fothayn.
