# In A Galaxy Far Far To Similar

### **Rebaav** (2009-02-06 09:30:51)

I have some questions about this whole Kalium thing, of which I have tried to make contributions myself.
What sets Kalium apart from the GalaxyFarFarAway (GFFA)?
What makes it different? What makes it unique? These are two very different questions.
& more importantly yet directly related to the previous questions:
What makes this ... location, worth playing in instead of GFFA? Why would someone bother to choose this as the location over the existing and huge GFFA?

For one thing, it is *our* galaxy, one that *we* made.  everything is going to be there because *we* want it to be.  *we* get to be the ones who decide what the major events are, and who the biggest players in history will be -- since they'll be *our* characters in a game.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-07 06:40:51)

Like MoDaVader said, itÂ´s *our* setting. ItÂ´s the same thing as in D&D wher you could choose to play in the FR setting or some other one. The main things that sets it apart will be non-rules technical and reside mainly in the stotytelling part of roleplaying, but as the Galaxy evolves, new technology, factions and other things will evolve.
As have been discussed in the Starships thread among others, we might wish to make changes to the standard of whatÂ´s normal. While most starships in the GFFA seems to be hyperspace capable, we have plans to make hyperdrives more rare in Kalium. I also had plans to make genetic manipulations and cybernethic technology more common and developed. My work had been put on hold for a bit, but now that I have Scum & Villainy and itÂ´s rules for equipment modding to use a basis, I think IÂ´ll get started again.

So we are changing the brand? "Ours".

I'm not sure I follow this. So far it seems to be the GFFA with a different political history and a different star map yet somehow the player races are the same. With a different galactic map why have any player races the same as the GFFA?
Darth could you expand on the "non-rules technical" please? I understand the storytelling thing thought that brings to mind "too many chefs in the kitchen" but I'm trying to both better understand and perhaps promote more interest.
Once we've explored the questions I've posed the answers, i hope, would help with answering "why should I contribute"?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-08 16:59:55)

The main thing I see setting Kalium apart from the GFFA is the setting. Everything, the political climate, the history, the species, the technology, plays a part in setting it aside. However, for the purpose of playing, we donÂ´t really change the rules (or maybe we will, who knows?) that much.
On the other hand, since this Galaxy is supposed to be different, it will need things to make it stand aside. Here we create new species, starships, factions, and technology that are unique.

I like this summary. Is this posted somewhere I missed?
So to slightly paraphrase: "Everything plays a part in setting it aside." This tells me there should be **very** few things it has in common with GFFA. So far IIRC I've seen "all races in GFFA are in Kallium" and "All ships/tech in GFFA are in Kallium." This seems like wanting to include too much and in doing so makes Kallium so close to GFFA it defeats the purpose of having it seperate.
I'd really like to see some furtherance of the differences to set it aside. Great example is that hyperdrive difference already mentioned. Why is it different? Is it something with the nature of traversed space in Kallium? Is there something else that could effect? Is Gravity different? Is it more a field effect so things like Shields work differently? This could keep going obviously.
What does GFFA have that Kallium does not? Perhaps this is a better place to start?
This gets back to a question I've asked before which is what IS Kallium? Alternate/ mirror universe/ quantum reality? Pocket dimension? Some poor smucks bad dream? What?

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-09 11:52:22)

Well, since we still want it to be a "Star Wars" feel to it, weÂ´ve chosen to include the basic species along, but as you can read, there have been changes to many of them. For technology, well, sure it can be the same, but thereÂ´s also been a few submissions of technology never heard of in the GFFA. For ships, I donÂ´t think IÂ´ve recall ever seing us agree to have all the GFFAÂ´s ship in Kalium. In fact, I personally voiced the suggestion that all ships entering Kalium **must** be constructed using the rules in SotG, thus disqualifying a lot of the ships from published book (if not all of them). As far as I recall, this was something we all agreed on.
Why is hyperdrives different? A good question, and one that we are working on. You have some good ideas, throw them into the fray and see what happens. Will shields be working differently? Maybe, this is also something we can work on. Will we change the *mechanics* behind how something works? (for example SR) Or will we say that it is a different technology, but keeping the same rule mechanics? (perhaps shields in Kalium works different against different damage types, are self-regenerating, etc).

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-09 16:59:01)

There was a nice long thread about the technology differences in Kalium, but its one of those missing threads.  Ideas for different weapon types were suggested (sonic, projectile, ice, etc.) and someone (I don't remember who) said that each of our factions could use a different type of weapon and shield technology to make each faction really different from the others around it.  This also made it different from the GFFA in that the same types aren't available to everyone.
And I think Kalium was supposed to be the Galaxy Next Door, but I'm not sure about that.

---

### **Rebaav** (2009-02-10 10:29:08)

I think we should have a summary for all this, a sort of Kallium Gazette a where are we now kind of thing.
The SotG rules standardization I do recall as well but what struck me is that that was also particular to GFFA. Everyone everywhere installed this or that just the same with the same difficulty and costing the same resources as everyone else. I also recall something about everyone using stuff a little different so that suggests, to me, that that should be reflected in the Faction/racial build.
This does remind me of something. This magical thing where if it's a Correllian ship it gets extra points has already been taken care of by the SotG standardization right? Sounds like it I just want to make sure, cuz that's just messed up and can stay in GFFA as far as I'm concerned!

GNG neat! Ha!

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-10 11:10:45)

Well, we are keeping track of things in these separate forums, and on the website, but maybe we should have some "super-giant-repository" as well. Hmm, IÂ´ll have to think about it.
As fa as the rules go, why donÂ´t use what weÂ´ve already got? WeÂ´re trying to create a setting, not a new game system. But like I said, if there are any rules changes that you think should become standard ruling for games played in Kalium, then just say it.
As far as I know, nothing has changed, and ships made by CEC still starts with 5 free EP instead of 1 as by Scum & Villainy, and I donÂ´t see anything wrong with that. I just consider it a template for ships, which could be made for other large ship manufacturers as well.

Just a master reference doc, maybe linked to the relavent forum posts. An FAQ of sorts perhaps.

I was just suggesting that there be some mechanic present that reflects the desire to have different tech beyond storytelling.

Awsome, sounds great.

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-10 12:37:49)

Hmm, yeah...IÂ´ll see if I can work something out.
As for mechanics that represents different tech beyond storytelling, IÂ´m not sure what youÂ´re getting at. If you want a new *technology* then just post it, these are several examples already. If you want a new *mechanic* then post it, and weÂ´ll see if it is something we want.

If the factions are different with their ship tech I'm trying to suggest that perhaps, as a start maybe, that the factions should be different with their ship tech... <!-- s:) -->![:)](https://i.ibb.co/8LPNcWCM/icon-e-smile.gif)<!-- s:) -->

Ah, I think I see what you mean now. And if I get you correctly, I think youÂ´re saying you think we should do things weÂ´ve been doing all along  :P

---

### **Rebaav** (2009-02-11 08:17:31)

Sure, that'll work. If we are leaving the differences as straight story telling instead of incorporating a mechanic to reflect it, in say the Faction build, then sure lets just keep doing what we've been doing...
What was that again?  ???

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-11 10:24:15)

Creating factions, species, planets and technology for our new Galaxy, and trying to determine some kind of common ground history.

I'll try this again: I'd like to see some relationships drawn out for that list, like between technology and... anything. Are ___ great at building/making/developing ___ just because it's in their backstory or is there some mechanic to back it up.
I'll try an example.
Corelian ships in GFFA had extra EPs. In GFFA there is no corelians, I'd like to see it go the other way. Faction/company/whatever A ships have +10 SR, B has +5 DR, C has +whatever in cargo, etc. I'm sure that could be band-aided in but I'm looking for it to be part of the descriptions/builds of the *builders* not just what's built.
Does this make more/any sense?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-11 15:39:11)

As far as I recall, no, we havenÂ´t specified any specific templates for ships being produced by a certain company.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-11 16:28:22)

I like that idea.  Certain companies would associated with certain factions, and their designs would reflect the ideas and wealth of the faction.  Take the Hutts for example ('cause, really, I just like mentioning them).  Their design standards would fit around ships with a big intimidation factor (see the *Obsidian Sky*) and are built mostly by the Ysanna, their military/Force organization.  I don't know how to express these things mechanically, but that's what you were looking for, right?

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-11 16:35:12)

Not all things have to be expressed with a certain mechanic. For the Hutts, they probably just slaps a lot of guns on their ships, thatÂ´s intimidating enough. We donÂ´t need to have a specific company template for every little thing. Rather than inventing some company that grants ships +10 SR, just let that company take a habit of installing stronger shield generators than others.

Right. Exactly. Even some mention in the Factions that a typical build of their stuff would look like ___ compared to these other guys that looks like ___. Just trying to look at some flavor is all.

That's fine with me.  I think we should still note someplace the ways that different companies build their ships so when we do create ships built by them, we don't find that the Hutts are also building pleasure yachts.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-11 16:47:47)

Yes, of course. Such things would naturally fall into the description of a faction/company/whatever. I just donÂ´t want things rambling away and people start making up all kinds of specialized companies that adds +5 SR, +1 DR, or any kind of minor bonuses just for the sake of giving them some mechanical effect.
And why couldnÂ´t Hutts build a pleasure yacht? It could just be a cover name for "Torture Prison Ship", and once word of it leaks out, itÂ´ll be intimidating as h*ll  ;D

### **Thraken** (2009-02-11 16:54:46)

If there's no objection, At some point I may put together a draft Kalium starship and space rules thing.
If I do I'd like people's opinions and such and I could edit the post as needed.

---

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-11 17:23:09)

Didn't you used to have something like that, DA?  I remember a starship creation guide somewhere.  Oh, wait, I found it.  Never mind, it was just a step-by-step guide on how to do it with the SotG rules.
Well, I wouldn't mind seeing it if you put one up.  Too bad the old Brainstorming thread is gone.  It had some really cool space ideas in it.  Well, that's all right, that thread was getting long anyway.  This seems to be our new Brainstorming thread.

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2009-02-11 17:28:34)

Yeah, I think I have it somewhere. IÂ´ll check if I can find it and post it on the main website. I may have to rewrite it though, as the tags and formatting changed for articles with the last forum move.

This is just what I was talking about. Some mention of style of build of what a group / company/ whatever would typically put out there into the Kalium Galaxy. This way when there is a submission made there is a possible destination already available. This, of course, would not be restricted to just startships but with all technology.
The same could then be said about a faction that uses a certain style as would be worked into their description. Like the Jovian race build Tru & I started (they were xenophobic so they were their own faction) which included description of their typical tactics and technology (they had their own of that too).
In more generic terms Group A may favour heavily shielded ships as juggernaught troop/fighter carriers with, perhaps, fast agile troops where Group B, perhaps, the opposite, for example. This would mean that Group A could favour using ships from Company Z where Group B would favour from Company Y and so on. This way if someone wants to build a fast lethal strike/gunship they can see that perhaps Group B may use it or if someone wants to introduce some interaction with Group B they have an idea of the composition and demeanor of forces encountered, for example. Likewise a ground encounter and therefore an idea of the composition and demeanor of the antagonists etc etc.
I was just looking for some way of tying things together so that Kalium can take a shape. It's relationships that define everything so to have that sketched out so the contributors can flesh it out, I feel, would be a big deal.

---

### **Thraken** (2009-02-13 11:13:33)

I think agreeing on a timeline may go a long way towards that as we can work out their place in the current climate or maybe even be slotted into or shaped by events in the Galaxy.
edit: I'm such a creationism geek. every recent post in this section is me >_<

How about assigning a certain number of EP's to each craft, and use that to modify the ship to a "faction template"? This woudl apply only to those factions that are above the norm in certain areas.
For example, normal frigates have 50 EP. The Ysanna frigate have 50 EP's, plus 5 more dedicated to armor, shields, and other defensive areas. This might encourage some min/max'ing (using all of those EP for defense, and using all of the fifty to everythign BUT defense), but careful GM monitoring could be the answer.
If we go with a template, I highly suggest using a certain maximum of EP's from base each faction may be. Like, say, 5 EP's of bonus for being this faction. Anything over that requires the giving up of either EP's from the ship or other extras. Again, an example. The Alician Accords, a highly organized religion based on the idea of caring, understanding, and free (slave) trade, are natural adepts at creating ships and ion cannons. All Alician Accords ships have a pair of medium ion cannons on them (fire-linked if necessary) and have their sub-light light drives boosted two squares (effectively using 2 EP over the allotted 5). However, fast with extra guns cost, and the AA ships have 2 points lower armor (paying for that boosted speed).
The issue I see with the above method is that not all systems are created equal. A bad girl fighter pilot can use her defense bonus in place of the armor rating of the ship, meaning that every heroic character will prefer an AA ship over some thign that grants better armor in at the cost of speed, sensors, weapons, etc. So this needs monitiering as well.
Hm...I'll think on it.

While it is a good idea, I think it would be better for overall balance to say that certain factions/companies *uses* the rules in different ways rather than *improving* the rules for them.

### **Anonymous** (2009-02-19 18:10:58)

Yeah, I was just about to say that. While it's certainly tempting to add more rules, it would probably be more effective to simply use the existing rules in different ways.
For example, you could build the AA ships so that each of them includes an ion cannon as part of their armament *without* adding more EP. When you write up the faction, include a section about their starship construction company (AA Spaceworks or whatever) and state that they always build an ion cannon into their designs. Every ship we end up design for them will then have an ion cannon already installed.

---

### **BreederofPuppets** (2009-02-21 18:58:57)

I didn't mean to imply granting a blanket bonus, to be used on a whim. My intent was to put an EP limit on the "faction template". But, like I said, this is just an idea, and I'm not married to it.

This, I think, is the closest thing we'll get to representing what I was talking about, quite.
Having a "this group typically favours big mass drivers" and "this group favours heavier armour" in the description would flesh it out completely, just so people have some idea what to expect.
