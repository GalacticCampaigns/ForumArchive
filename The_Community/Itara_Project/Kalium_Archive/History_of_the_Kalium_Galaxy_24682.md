# History of the Kalium Galaxy

### **Alicia** (2010-06-09 12:59:43)

(( Rowen had posted this a couple years ago to the moderator forum and has for awhile now been collecting dust. As more and more people have wondered what exactly the KG is, I feel its time it be brought out into the light for the community to pick at. I know there are still some issues within which need to be refined and some embellished, but hopefully together as a community we can do so. It is my hope that this can become the foundation in which this galaxy will come to life. ))
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Beginnings</span>
The galaxy was in mass chaos. Races fought against one another in petty squabbles and land mass rights. Peace was a bleak concept that no one could grasp. During a unified summit of all core worlds a scientist brought forth an idea..Hyperspace travel.
It was the first recorded account of a summit that did not end in bloodshed. Races and factions worked together in the hopes of what could be a greater future. Immediately Marcus Tain, the scientist responsible for the idea was elected to spear head its conception.
The Hyperspace rings would require massive resources to build. Contractors began bidding wars to be included in the gates construction, thus insuring a life time of work and a steady income. The wars quickly turned to violence, leading to Sabotage, espionage, and outright physical attacks. Smaller contractors were soon crushed by larger, resource heavy corporations. Only four of the largest remained for the construction of the rings.
Not all citizens relished the thought of hyperspace travel, or the strain it was placing on the lower class citizens. Countless setbacks were incurred when anti-hyperspace protestors started turning to coordinated attacks. Heavy damage was caused to nearly completed rings and hundreds of innocent workers killed. These attacks nearly stopped the program altogether but Marcus Tain's first galactic speech rallied for a unified galactic protectorate. This new entity would be responsible for keeping the gates and the citizens working on them safe.
An investigations branch was created within the protectorate ranks. It was their responsibility to investigate any infraction against the construction of the gates. Many of the aggressors were found to originate from the planet Firaxia. Further investigation of these people uncovered that they poses powers of the mind and body that most were unfamiliar with. The findings frightened most people, fearing the Firaxian people would become too powerful. They were labeled witches, wizards, and all manner of unspeakable names. The Galactic Protectorate was sent to police the planet.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">The Genealogy Wars</span>
DNA samples were taken from those found to have the forbidden powers. Through these samples the investigations branch, under supervision of the unified government, would track down those related to the undesirables and place them in internment camps. This was the start of the Genealogy wars. Where DNA make up was the deciding factor on a individuals freedom.
Marcus Tain died the day the first ring was complete. His successor, Tornik Scraf made his inaugural speech to the unified worlds. Promising to continue the gates construction and to further the role the Protectorates played in keeping the galaxy safe. It was at this time the Firaxian people decided to fight back!
The conflict that ensued was brutal and thousands of Firaxians died in the conflict. Thousands more were placed in prison camps and sent to private forced labor camps. Others fell into hiding, creating another life for themselves. Thousands more escaped on transports and stolen ships, using the warp gate as a means to propel them far from the core worlds. The unified government covered up the story. Tornik announced the ships were destroyed in a failed attempt to use the Hyperspace ring.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Arrival of the Sith in Kalium Galaxy</span>
One hundred years later the escaped Firaxian people find refuge in one of the outer rim worlds. Many died during the long voyage and a new generation was born in space flight. Rebuilding their lives on a new planet was difficult but they managed. They kept their ships intact and used them and the equipment they carried to create a city much like their home planet. Several years into the rebuilding a ship crashes just beyond the city.
The pilot managed to crash land on a remote planet in the outer rim, in the Crux system. He is found and nursed back to health by the Firaxian people. Once physically able he introduces himself as Edrik Carn, Sith Lord and recounts his mission and its tragic end. The people awe at his control of what they now know is the force, and he begins to teach them how to hone their power.
Through his tutelage and leadership the Firaxian people thrive and begin to create a new age. An age in Edrik Carns own vision. He orders ships to be made using his crashed space craft as a blue print. Through manipulation he also manages to connect his data pad to their computers to give the Firaxian engineers the schematic they need for larger, more powerful ships.
As the years passed the hatred taught by Edrik reaches its peak and the Firaxian people, under the leadership of their Sith lord begin to prepare for retribution. The core worlds that shunned them would fall under there might. Ship production is increased and training begins.
300 years after the first gates completion the final rings are finished. It is declared a galactic holiday in memory of Marcus Tain and his vision. The Galactic Protectorate is now an army under the Unified government and is considered by commoners as the new thugs of the galaxy. They are now in full force around the core worlds and protect the rings at all costs. The unified government now sets its sites on planets beyond the core worlds.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Arrival of the Jedi</span>
Several years after the completion of the rings an incident occurred. One of the galactic protectorate ships was destroyed and a ring damaged. The investigations branch found the ring to be at fault. Causing a flash back that destroyed the Protectorate ship. In truth it was a test flight and attack run by a Sith bomber/fighter squadron. They were piloted by the descendants of the new Firaxian colony from the outer rim.
It was in this same year that another anomaly occurred and sent another ship drastically close to the core worlds. Through advanced piloting skills Ara Noor, Jedi Master was able to regain control of her ship and avoid a crash landing on Hyperis, the galaxy's capitol world. She was brought before the galactic government and made a representative of her home galaxy.
The next 10 years introduced the core worlds to new advances in technology. Ships with on board hyperdrives were in production and the Galactic Protectorate was being outfitted with new weapons and armor. Ara played a pivotal role in the advancement of their culture. Soon the rings would be a thing of the past and ships would be able to travel beyond the core worlds.
With several small squadrons in service Ara Noor found herself instructing the newest generation of combat pilots. Her teaching gathered many admirers and followers alike. She was able to make several close friends, those she was able to divulge her entire history to. Several showed promise in the force and were trained in secret.
<span style="font-size: 1.50em;">Galactic War</span>
20 Years after Ara Noor arrived in the Kalium Galaxy her world was again turned upside down. In a coordinated strike the Sith managed to hyperspace directly to each planet. The battle that ensued was brutal.
All twelve of the rings were destroyed. Some effectively enough to leave only space dust floating beside their planets. Others broke orbit and floated off into space to settle in other areas of the galaxy. One plummeted to Jevim Nar creating a crater 40km wide in each direction.
Ara's fighters performed as expected. There small numbers were able to destroy many of the Sith fighters. Casualties were heavy on both sides but still the battle waged on. The closest of the core worlds received the greatest protection. Most of the Sith capital ships were destroyed leaving the fighters swarming around to be picked off.
The Siths number had increased greatly, enough that the capitol was under ground assault. Ara Noor, attempting to get to her fighter was cut off by the ground troops. In her fight she left all inhibitions behind and ignited her lightsaber. It was by her hand that the leaders of the Unified Galactic Government (UGG) survived.
Several squadrons survived that onslaught, each side lost many good men and women. Innocents were killed on many of the core worlds. Eventually the Sith broke their attack and retreated but not without first promising to return and finish what they started. The core was left to ponder its humanity.
The coming months brought forth many changes. The first of which was for Ara to explain her actions to the UGG. They were grateful for her assistance and the information that she had given them since her arrival. She was allowed to create a new Jedi Order, one that would exceed the Council of old. She was allowed to mold it as she saw fit and would be granted any resources she needed to establish and train her new students.
The Sith fell back to regroup and train. They had enacted there revenge but hungered for more. The hundreds of years of planning and preparing had left them with no other choice and it was now their life. They knew it would not be long before they were found. They were surprised the core worlds had technology to match their own. It was something they would soon not forget.

From here, I would like to invite the community to take the history in the first post and include embellishments to any history points. We can use Rowen's original history as a foundation to build Kalium.
Here's some rules:
If you are going to embellish or alter a point in the history please make a post before hand stating you are working on it.
The addition can not alter anything before or after in the timeline without the community's approval.
The community is also invited to stat out any of the factions, vehicles, NPCs, etc in the timeline.

Here's my proposed version of events regarding the Jedi. I have left out parts within the two sections which would be unchanged.
Birth of the Jedi
It was on a long forgotten paradise world that an explorer discovered ancient ruins of a magnificent size. They stretched for hundreds of miles, the explorer could only guess at what they were but it seemed like a massive city. It was deep within these ruins that she awoke something more ancient than the ruins themselves. She left the planet a different person, a fiery personality had become serene and tranquil. It was her new mastery of the force which had been the biggest change however. The woman, Ara Nor founded an order of individuals personally sought out by her. They were trained in the ways of the force like her, in a dilapidated temple deep within the undercity of Hyperis. They slowly grew in number, though preferred to not attract any attention to themselves.
Galactic War
This changed the day that the Firaxians attacked the core worlds, assailing each planet with their ships of war. The hyperspace rings were destroyed and the worlds left isolated and weak. It would have been an easy victory for the sith had the Disciples of Nor not intervened. A single discipl, one on each of the 12 core worlds rose to unite the populace and lead a defense. Some were excellent orators and demagogues, whilst others were diplomats. They were all unequaled in combat however, their mastery of the force allowed them to spearhead counter attacks to beat back the Firaxian invasion forces before finally driving them off into the void.
I'm undecided as to whether or not lightsabers would be involved yet, either way I think they should be related to the paradise world's ruins. Which could also be a place of jedi pilgrimage, perhaps it's where they go to create their own lightsabers due to an abundance of suitable crystals.
