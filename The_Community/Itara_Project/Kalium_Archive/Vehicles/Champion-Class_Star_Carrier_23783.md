# Champion-Class Star Carrier

### **Avarna** (2009-02-09 14:20:46)

Well, This is my first submission to Kalium (Please don't hit me). I did create this using the battlecruiser stock ship, and the Sotg rules.
So, I offer for your consideration:
Nichet Royal Shipworks **Champion-Class Star Carrier**
Colossal(cruiser) Capital Ship
**Init** -4; **Senses Perception** +5
======================================================
**Defenses** Ref 17 (flat-footed 16), Fort 55; +16 Armor
**Hp** 2000; **DR** 20; **SR** 150 **Damage Threshold** 255
======================================================
**Speed** Fly 2 Squares (Starship Scale)
Attacks: 2 Medium Turbo lasers +4 5d10x5
            2 Med Laser cannon Batteries (Point Defense) +14 4d10x2
               Tractor Beam +4
**Base Attack** +0; **Grp** +65
======================================================
**Abilities** Str 100, Dex 12, Con - , Int 18
**Skills** Initiative -4, Pilot -4, Mechanics +5, Perception +5, Use Computer +5
======================================================
**Crew** 6700 (normal); **Passengers** 2500
**Cargo** 10,000 tons; **Consumables** 2 years; **Carried Craft** 48 (Gargantuan) Starfighters, and 2 Transports
**Hyperdrive** x2 Navicom
**Availability** Military; **Cost** 39,262,000 Credits
**Systems** Advanced Slave Circuits, Medical Suite (200 beds, 20 Tanks), Anti-Boarding System, 5 unused EP
Weapons:
2 Medium Turbo lasers +4 (-16 against small)5d10x5
2 Med Laser cannon Batteries (Point Defense) +14 4d10x2
   Tractor Beam +4 (Point Defense)
Tactical fire: The Champion can forgo all attacks to help provide defensive fire for its parasite craft, giving all Allied fighters within 2 squares a +1 to Ref Defense.
History: With the rarity of hyperdrive systems, the need for large hyper transports are clear. While the Champion is geared towards the transportation needs of the military, several of them have been acquired by civilians interested and used as massive ferries, to transport privately owned craft that lack hyperdrives to other star systems. Of special interest is the unique tractor beam design, with specialized emitter arrays to recover damaged fighters. It has also been used creatively to capture undamaged enemy fighters.

Two things to note right away. The Strength score should be 100, they changed in in the errata. Also I think someone told me that all references to "Size modifier" was a typo and it should be the ships cost modifier instead, meaning 500, not 200.
Also, for future reference, could you post what you did to the stock ship? Changed stock stats, how you spent EP, such stuff. It makes it a lot easier to validate a design, and also for someone to understand how you put the ship together. You could just format it like this:
**Starting EP**
XX EP gaind from stock ship
XX EP gained from YY
XX EP gained from YY
.
.
.
**Spent EP**
XX EP spent on YY
XX EP spent on YY
.
.

I'll make the modifications. Thank you.
Starting EP
200EP gaind from stock ship
40 EP gained from halving cargo capacity
40 EP gained from halving passenger capacity
For a total of 280 EP
Spent EP
224 EP spent on hanger capacity
7 EP spent on Shields
3 EP spent on X2 hyperdrive
1 EP spent on Navicomp
10 EP spent on Tractor beam
12 EP spent on laser cannon batteries
10 EP Spent on 2 medium turbo lasers
1 EP spent on Medical Suite
1 EP spent on Advanced Slave Circuits
5 EP spent on Anti-Boarding System
Total Spent 275

I donÂ´t get the hangar space to add up. 252 spent EP should mean 31,5 (donÂ´t know if you can use half modifications) hangar modules, for a total of 315 units of hangar space. 72 gargantuan starfighter is 360 units of hangar space, and 3 transports should be 60 more for a total of 420 units of hangar space.
You should only have a -4 to Pilot and Initiative, but other than that things seems to work out.
As a suggestion for some improvement though, IÂ´d recommend removing some hangar space or one or two laser cannons to install Anti-Boarding Systems (S&V, pg 56). Seems to fit in with the description of the ship.

Medical suite is /5 beds and /50 tanks. So you should have 100 medical beds and 10 bacta tanks
And I'm not sure what the general opinion on this is, but at one point over in starship submissions costmod/5 was suggested as a more sensible rate for Hangar Bays. Based on my tests, this makes it feasible for frigate sized ships to carry fighters or transports and allow for much higher capacity in colossal(cruiser) size ships.

While Yes, that was suggested, There wasn't an agreement that that would be the standard to use for Kallium, so I used the standard rules.

I had the math figured out, but now I can't remember how I got to it. That 84 points worth of hanger was what I needed for 24 fighters and one transport. But now that I'm actually using a calculator its not adding up. <!-- s:( -->![:(](https://i.ibb.co/FqwXZcmj/icon-e-sad.gif)<!-- s:( -->

I'm no expert on designing ships with the Saga rules (actually, I'm terrible at it), so I can't help much in that department.  But I do like what I see.  We need more of these generic ships that can be seen throughout the galaxy.
One thing, though, about Tactical Fire.  It should read, "The Champion can forgo all attacks to help provide defensive fire for its parasite craft, giving all **allied** fighters within 2 squares a +1 to Ref Defense."  We don't want it to help its enemies out (unless that was your intention).

Thank you MoDoVader.
I've now fixed everything thats been mentioned.
