**History** Created by the Valorn to serve as a short-range planetary defense fighter, the Dragonfang is a light interceptor, that relies heavily on its speed and maneuverability to survive in combat. Like the warriors who pilots them, these fighters puts their trust in themselves and their skills, and does not hide behind heavy armor. Their tactics are pretty straightforward, they will use their superior speed to reach and quickly engage the enemy in dogfights, where their powerful plasma cannons will be put to good use. They often flies in formation to screen the heavier Titan-class fighters, as they seek out and engage larger enemy ships. They have been named after the Tundra Dragons, wild beasts that roams the frigid plains of Aesa.

**History** Developed as a supplement to the quick and nimble Dragonfang fighters, the Titan carries enough firepower to take on larger ships in addition to small fighters. Equiped with extremely advanced sensor arrays and an impressive set of plasma cannons, the Titan sports a good match against most smaller capital ships. Typically forming up in an agressive formation, the pilots will dive closely to the ship and allow the gunners to unleash a powerful volley at Point Blank Range.In order to allow the pilots optimal chance at performing these daring strikes, the ship has been equipped with heavily empowered maneuvering jets. In order to accomodate all these advanced equipment, the designers of the craft decided to take away of the structure of the ship, making it a little less durable than other craft. This was compensated a little by the installation of a powerful shield generator though.

I'd like to see a thread about submission conventions including any errata so any stat blocks have some cohesion to them. You've created these ships so I'd like to know what you think about that.
The Action iv or what-have-you has 90 000tons storage in the ships of the galaxy. If you take off 40k of that for EPs & give it's scale of Collasal(frigate) thats a x50 multiplyer so 40 000 /50 = 800 EPs. This seems rather excessive... ok it's freaking insane. If I wanted to have a devoted combat ship I could sack all that space for 1800 EPs. Surely I'm missing something. I've looked for more errata but I'm stunned. If I'm not missing anything let's start a thread on this but I'd value your insight first (cuz those ships seem pretty cool. Are plasmas in the Starships sup? I didn't see them either).

I canÂ´t remember exactly where, but IÂ´ve read something about the errate on those obscene EP numbers.
And no, the Plasma Cannons are not in any book, youÂ´ll find them under "Weapons and Armor" in this forum <!-- s:D -->![:D](https://i.ibb.co/MDcFvFDD/icon-e-biggrin.gif)<!-- s:D -->

I'd love to see the used erratas and any house rules available posted. Is there a submisisons guidelines section for Kalium & is any of this included? (I'm looking right now)

New weapon designed by & for Kalium? Interesting. I'll go look at that. I'm curious what rules are used to repair lost DR.

i would think the DR loss only lasts the encounter (assuming the targets still alive by the end)

It would last until the ship has undergone sufficent repairs, which would be to fix up the hull of the ship, replacing lost and damaged armor plating, etc.

### **Anonymous** (2008-10-15 00:35:22)

what would the cost of such repairs be? (seeing as no cost for repairs is given, in Sotg, or anywhere else)

---

### **DarthAnthrax** (2008-10-15 00:47:00)

I donÂ´t know, never was good with costs, but I suppose it would be an application of the Repair Object skill use.

as I said, there are no costs listed there, and considering the plasma cannon does permanent damage, I'd assume there's some need to buy metals and supplies to patch the hull
