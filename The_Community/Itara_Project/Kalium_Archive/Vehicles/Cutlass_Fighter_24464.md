The Venerable Cutlass Starfighter is the evolution of the smaller and less heavily armed Rapier Class that NRS had produced in limited numbers years before. Like many NRS designs, its a sleek, nimble ship with surprisingly heavy punch thanks to its external hardpoints. its also the standard fighter of the Nichet Armed Forces.
EP Spends:
Base 5 EP
Halved Cargo to gain 1 EP
Spent 1 on Hardpoints
Spent 1 on Shields
Spent 3 on blaster cannon

Seems like a solid, (relatively) cheap fighter. Just a few things:

* Cost should be 115,700, including the cost for the Hardpoints and the missiles
* There should be no EP left for the ship, since the Blaster Cannon should cost 3 EP and not 2. If you want it to have 1 leftover EP, I would suggest using a Double cannon instead of Firelinked, for 5,500 extra credits.
* The skill modifiers seems to be somewhat off. It should be Initiative/Pilot +10
* The ship is Huge in size, but its fighting space is close to that of most space transports, and far greater than that of even the largest starfighters?
* Reflex Defense should be 18(11)
* Grapple should be +24

I made the needed changes.
A note on EP: if you looked though the listed EP expenditure, I still have 1 EP remaining. (I'd forgotten to adjust EP when I decided to have one less hardpoint array, and fire link the cannon.)

Yeah, I basically assume most irregularities I find is the result of things that youÂ´ve forgotten to adjust for changing something else.

It looks all good - but may I ask why they have a +2 perception bonus in there at the top?
Could also update the skills with the relevant modifiers
And an observation - it seems from the official word that reducing something by 50% is considered reducing by 25% rounded up twice. Thus halving cargo gives you 2 EP. I've quoted that example in the collected errata thread.
