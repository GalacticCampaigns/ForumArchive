Mass Drivers ignore SR completely but deal less damage than an equivalent laser weapon.
Ubese Cybernetic Interface: All ubese military vessels have ports designed to interface directly with the cybernetics of the ubese pilot. A ubese pilot gains a +1 bonus to all checks that rely on the vehicle, whilst piloting it. This includes pilot, use computer and mechanics checks. Non ubese characters can never gain this benefit. (This statblock does not include these bonuses)
The first iteration of the new Ubese navy's fighter craft, the Guardian 1 is the most produced fighter craft. It lacks shield generators but boasts a reinforced hull and a mass driver capable of puncturing the hull of a craft twice it's size. The Guardian does have it's weaknesses though, it's incapable of threatening larger craft and relies on it's speed to survive prolonged encounters.
The craft is defined by it's two main thrusters which the rest of the vessel seems to be designed around. The cockpit is parched atop the front of the fuselage whilst the large Mass Driver is slung beneath it, almost as long as the entire interceptor itself. Guardian's are usually launched from Sentinel class carriers, but they are also found running patrols within the Ubese System.
Notes/
This is based on the rules from the SOTG apart from the mass driver and the cybernetic interface (which is based on the personalised controls upgrade) This is accounted for in the higher cost and this vessel is military meaning it's not exactly easy to get a hold of.

For nitpicking
Don't forget that a pilot gets a +2 atk bonus to weapons he controls and you can add INT bonus to use computer checks.
As for increasing DR and Shield ignoring - I wonder on the balance of those as I believe you used a single EP for each...
All the other structural improvements use 2, 5, 10 and 20 EPs
And in Saga edition the only shield ignoring weapon seen is the wonderfully broken Kedalbe's 8d20x5 mass driver missile. No other Mass driver or rail gun in Saga seems to ignore shielding.
This was gonna be one of the things I was going to discuss in the "Unstatted Weapons" thread...

Mass Drivers is one of their trademark things though, due to the fact lasers are useless on their planet, they ended up using mass drivers in spacecraft and they also use dumbfire missiles though as an interceptor this has none. And whilst the mass driver ignores SR, it has lower damage (a medium laser cannon has 4d10x2 compared to the mass dirvers 3d10x2) and lacks any shields itself, meaning fights will be shorter where ubese craft are involved. I think this is well balanced and so the EP is the same as a regular medium laser cannon. The larger ships will have larger mass drivers, but probably not as bas as the Keldabe's mass driver missile (which isn't making sense in my head actually).
Dumbfire missiles can only make area attacks and never get a second chance to hit like regular missiles. The Ubese generally saturate a target with dozens of these or use them as point defense.
