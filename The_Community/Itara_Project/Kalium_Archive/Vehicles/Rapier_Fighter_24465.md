Lacking shields, and the external hardpoints that are a staple of Nichet Starfighter design, the Rapier is seen as something of a false start. However, many of its systems and design elements are latter incorporated into the Cutlass design. None the less, its low price tag makes it an attractive purchase for those with less money to spend.
EP Expenditure:
Gained 2 EP base
gained 1 ep for halving cargo
Spend 2 EP on weapons

Greetings, I'm still here and nitpicking.
You've not adjusted the various skills with the appropriate modifiers - so Initiative and pilot would be +8 and use computer +7.
I'm still wondering where your +2 perception comes from :P
Flat footed defense should be 11.
Grp gets a +10 size bonus for +22
Like with the Cutlass - I think the official take on the EPs gets you another EP for halving the cargo capacity...
