*treated as a gargantuan starfighter.
The Broadsword-class escort gunship, was designed to fulfill the need of a long range escort, capable of engaging capital ships as well as starfighters. The mass saved by not fitting the ship with FTL capacity, makes the Broadsword surprisingly nimble for such a large craft, and isn't a drawback as its regularly attached to ships large enough for it to dock with. The Broadsword has also found a niche as a system patrol and defense craft.

This ship is *brutal*. I like it. I can easily see this thing being the nasty punch to a squadron mounted on a carrier fleet.
How old is the design? Is this an ancient style that has under gone constant refits/improvements, a modern yet stable design, or some thing that has just rolled off the assembly line in the passed decade?
Or are these questions the rest of us should answer?

I'm glad you like it.
I see it as being one of Nichet Royal Shipworks staple products, its not an ancient design, but they've produced it for several decades.

Indeed it looks good - I guess all I can do is nitpick >8)
Grapple is +40. 20 from being colossal and 20 from Strength mod.
Perception should be +5, Use computer should be +8. Unless your ship specifically enhances visual sight out the window also...
