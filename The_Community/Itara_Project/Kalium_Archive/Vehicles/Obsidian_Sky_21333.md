Ten years ago, the Ysanna started construction of a mobile command post, one so large that it could hold all of the Ysanna at once, as well as their support personnel. When the Obsidian Sky was finished, it became the symbol of the Ysannaâ€™s might throughout the galaxy.
The Obsidian Sky was so named because should it pull over a city, it would darken the area like night. That is enough to make the populace more cooperative with the Ysanna.While the sight of an Ysanna brings dread to some, all fear the Obsidian Sky.
The High Lord of the Ysanna commands the Obsidian Sky, and it always goes where he orders it. Often he keeps it around Hutta Prime as the centerpiece of its defense, though it occasionally makes forays into other parts of the galaxy to help maintain order and justice.
There is only one ship of this class in the galaxy. While the High Lord has the plans to them and can order more made, he has not done so and is not planning on it. Still, there are many people in the galaxy who would like to get their hands on those plans, if only they knew where the High Lord kept them.
It is a broad, flat ship, vaguely rectangular, and measures at nearly 24 kilometers long. It looks more like a starship than a space station, though technically it *is* a space station.
**Tactical Fire:** The Obsidian Sky is truly a terrible force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, capable of terrifying displays of brute force. As a standard action, the Obsidian Sky can forgo all attacks to provide tactical fire to all squares in a 3-square radius around itself. All enemy starships take a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, defenses, and skill checks while within the area.
Thanks to SacredPhoenix for providing the stats (I made only minor changes to it).

Looking nice, but what are the stock stats for a Space Station? Also, if you plan to post it on the main site, would you post EP useage and gains?

I don't think there are stock stats for a space station. SacredPhoenix should be able to answer your questions, since he designed the ship. He'll have to give me the EP, but I may let him submit it, since he did all the hard work.

Ah, ok. Just trying to make sure that everything follows the set format.

I used a template I made for dreadnaught type ships, and changed them a little bit (since the template is based of a super star destroyer, but I didn't believe it should have as good stats)
